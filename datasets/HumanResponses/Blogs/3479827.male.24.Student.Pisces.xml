       As I write this, Matt is moving out with the help of his mum. Yuqi, Jinbo and I are cleaning the house and packing everything today and tomorrow. Then, on Tuesday, we're moving out too (Sniff!)  We've got a few days to organise our things, then it's off to China next Saturday!

       We've just come back from a beach party in cornwall. Thanks to kevin for organising it. We had sun, surf and a barbecue. Chefs jimmy and ed did a great job of cooking the food, even without any cooking implements! Then, there was an emotional goodbye to everyone, some who we may not see again!

       Local time 11pm tuesday  not a lot to report today, pretty much stayed at yuqi's parents apartment. Yuqi needed to see the dentist today, so i spent most of the afternoon doing laundry and using their computer.  Weather today was cooler than yesterday's 36, but still quite hot and sticky.  In the evening we had some delicious noodles together before watching tv until bedtime. Tomorrow, we'll be taking yuqi's nephew zhou xun out for the day, so will have more to say tomorrow :).  Interesting china fact #10 - karaoke is very popular here. In the cities you can see several karaoke bars (so called "ktv") where you can have a private karaoke room with your friends. Also, watching chinese tv, you'll find nearly all theme tunes or songs are subtitled so you can sing along (if, unlike me, you can read chineses characters!)

       Local time 10.45pm monday  the overnight train arrived back in shijiazhuang at 1pm. When stepping off the train, we were immediately hit by a blast of heat. After the cool huang shan mountain and the humid shanghai weather, the hot and very dry 36 degrees of shijiazhuang was quite a shock! We jumped straight into an air conditioned taxi back to yuqi's parents house.  Upon our arrival, we had a quick lunch together before her parents returned to work. After that, yuqi and i were still quite tired after all the travelling and took the opportunity to relax in the air conditioned apartment.  The heat outside really was too much, so we stayed in all afternoon. Later we all cooked dinner together and ate it with some nice cold shijiazhuang beer (san jiu pi jiu -three nines beer).  After dinner, we chatted whilst looking through some fantastic old photos of yuqi's family's travels. There's still plenty of wonderful places for us to visit next time!  Interesting china fact #9 - car number plates here are numbered quite differently to the uk. First there is a chinese character showing the area of origin. Then follows a letter showing which city/town or a number 0 denoting police. Finally is a serial number, lower numbers showing greater importance and status. For example, a number less than 100 could be a government or high ranking police leader. Most cars have numbers much higher, usually 5 or 6 digits.

       Local time 8.55pm sunday  the train arrived on time this morning in shanghai. We got out of the station about 10am. When we climbed the mountain we took minimal supplies and couldn't shower for 2 days. The first thing we wanted to do was shower and change into some clean clothes, so we checked into the same hotel as before. I think i've never enjoyed a hot shower that much in my life :).  After we'd freshened up, we met our friend ding rong jun who was looking after some of our luggage. We all went out for lunch to a local restaurant about 5 mins walk from the hotel. It was very nice and had some very fresh fish (fresh in that i'd seen it swimming around in a tank about 10 mins before we ate it).  After lunch we walked for 10 minutes to a tea market. It was two narrow streets about 200m long with nothing but tea. I've never seen that much tea before. The teas ranged from everyday types to some costing more than 60 english pounds for 500 grams (more than 880 chinese yuan). We tasted one tea which had a large flower bud. When placed in hot water, the bud opened and leaves unfurled. It looked great and tasted great. Unfortunately, we couldn't buy any; we'd already visited two tea shops and bought enough to last all year.  We then headed back to the hotel feeling tired. Now we were really feeling the effects of climbing the mountain, our legs were stiff and our knees aching. So, we collapsed into a heap in our room and slept for an hour or two.  We met rong jun again for dinner in the hotel and ate a full meal and drank some beer. Although we'd only met rong jun quite briefly, he definitely is a nice guy and i look forward to meeting him again.  So, after dinner it was back onto the train back to yuqi's home city shijiazhuang. The train departed at 8.28pm and will arrive tomorrow morning. We're actually travelling first class this time (no other tickets available). Here we have a more private cabin with 4 beds instead of the usual 6. The beds are softer and there's a sliding door we can close, making it very quiet. I'm off to bed now, so goodnight :)  interesting china fact #8 - getting a train ticket here is not very easy. Unlike the uk, every seat and bed is accounted for. If there's no seat you simply can't travel. They're always very busy, i haven't seen a single empty seat in my time here. The trains are wider and taller than the uk, having 2 seats on one side and 3 on the other. On the sleeper services, they have staff walking up and down the aisles at certain times selling food, drink and renting vcd players.

       Local time 9.20pm saturday  sleeping in the mountain hotel last night was an experience, being over 1.5km high. The hotel was quite basic since everything is brought up the mountain on foot. There are on roads and no cable car past half way, so there are men carrying huge sacks on their shoulders up the mountain to the hotel. I made me wonder how on earth they built the hotel in the first place!  We were sharing 6 to a room, 3 couples over 3 single bunk beds. Our plan was to get up at 4am to see the sun rise, but our plan was foiled by early morning rain and a thick mist. So, we slept a little later and had breakfast before leaving the hotel at 6am. Today, we saw another side of the mountain, including a famous pine tree that looks like a person with open arms welcoming you to the mountain. Once again, the scenery was amazing. Sometimes it was a little scary when the path got close to the edge with little or no fence. Anyhow, i survived despite me being clumsy.   Once we'd seen everything on our mountain tour, it was time to go back down to earth. There were 2 choices, take the cable car, or walk. We chose to walk, especially as we'd taken the cable car up at the beginning. Now, going down is not as easy as you might think. Imagine, thousands and thousands of steps, mostly going down (but still some upwards). If you're unfit like me, about a quarter of the way down it feels like your legs have turned to jelly and your knees have seized up. You also have to carefully watch each step so as not to slip or fall. As if that wasn't enough, you've also got people going up the mountain trying to get past you.  We descended quite quickly in the end, in just over 2 hours. At the end we reached the restaurant where the rest of the group were waiting. Once i sat down there, i didn't want to move my legs again! In total, we were climbing, walking, or going down from 6am to 12pm! I feel i really accomplished something i've never done before in my life and yuqi and i had a great experience.  After the mountain, our tour briefly took us to a tea shop and a zoo. The zoo deserves a mention when they milked (get the venom out its fangs) a very poisonous snake (called the "5 steps snake" due to the supposed number of steps you can walk before dying once bitten). Once milked, they poured out the venom and invited us to drink it. I declined, but several others tried it and walked more than 5 steps, so it must be ok :)  and that was the end of our tour. Yuqi and i left the group to look around a very old and traditional shopping street. It was very nice and we had a glorious buffet meal at a restaurant there. After that, we came back to the train station to await our train back to shanghai. I'm writing this now in the tea lounge beside the station over a nice cup of green tea.  That's all for today, more from shanghai tomorrow before we head back to yuqi's home in the evening.  Interesting china fact #7 - in most shops and restaurants the staff don't wear name badges. Instead they are given a number. Traditionally the chinese don't like to reveal their names publicly.

       Local time 8.00pm friday  the train arrived 45 minutes late into huang shan station. When we arrived, it was pouring with rain, but luckily we were prepared with long trousers and coats. We met our guide and had a short break before setting off in the coach. The mountain was an hours drive away, in quite a remote area. At times it was raining so hard the road was like a river. I was a bit worried about the coach getting swept away, but we arrived safe and sound in the end.  Wrapped up to the eyeballs in waterproofs, we made our way to the entrance. We were packed into a large cable car and started our ascent. The cable car took us up about half way, which was just above the cloud line. The view here was incredible, and above the clouds, there was no rain... Perfect!  We first walked up to our hotel (about 1500+ metres up) where we checked in and put some luggage in our rooms. After a quick lunch, our tour guide started to take us around.  I really can't describe the mountain in words, everyone will have to wait for the pictures. From about 2pm to 6pm we were climbing and walking to various points. There was one point where there was a vertical rock on the top of a small summit. We were able to walk to the top, i was very scared because there was a small handrail between me and a sheer vertical drop into the clouds. The view was truly spectacular, even though i was practically frozen to the spot in terror!  At the end of the day, we climbed up to the top of that mountain where the highest point was 1800 metres up. From here we could see all the points we'd visited earlier below us. After pausing for some pictures, we came back to the hotel where we watched the sun go down under the clouds while we ate our dinner.  Fantastic :)  (very hard work though, and there's more tomorrow)  oh, and unexpectedly, i have good mobile reception up here - so i can continue my diary after all.

       Local time 10.15pm thursday  after falling asleep the moment we arrived back at the hotel last night, we awoke this morning quite refreshed. In the evening we had to catch a train for our next tour, so we couldn't stray too far from the hotel.  We decided to simply wander around shanghai and do some shopping for a while. We took the underground to the "people's square" which is a relatively small area bordered by roads and a large theatre. The square itself wasn't very interesting, but we spotted a sign for a hong kong shopping street underground. We took an escalator down into the narrow street. It was similar in style to the one in shen yang, but a lot smaller. Inside we found yuqi's most perfect bag in the world (it's pink and says "ice cream is my favourite") and a new shirt for me.  Other than that, we had a wander round a couple of shopping malls and had lunch in a japanese restaurant. I almost made the mistake of ordering chicken heart and stomach kebabs because the picture looked nice (and the caption simply said "assorted meat skewer"). In the end i had a lovely watermelon drink, some japanese tea, some minced chicken and some lovely dried potato balls.  After all the shopping, we were quite hot and tired, so we took the underground back to the hotel. We had dinner, showered and packed ready for our trip. We also met yuqi's sister's colleague, who was responsible for us getting the discount on the hotel room. He also very kindly offered to look after some of our luggage while we were travelling for the next few days.  So, now i'm on the 10 hour train ride to the yellow mountain (huang shan). We're climbing the mountain and staying overnight to watch the sun rise. It sounds hard work, but the scenery should be fantastic. I probably won't be able to update the diary for a couple of days (not much mobile phone reception at the top of a mountain), so look out for a big update soon. Over and out for now :)  interesting china fact #6 - shanghai is one of the more hi-tech cities. I've travelled in buses, taxi's and trains that have mini tv's showing adverts and other things, in the taxi they were built into the headrests. Some of the buses are electric too, running on electric cables above the road. At night, the city is illuminated by thousands of neon signs on the top of buildings, some of them even show live tv outside.

       Wednesday  i'm a day late writing this, i came straight back to the hotel last night and fell asleep.  Yesterday was our first organised tour. We were going to another city about 2 hours from shanghai called hang zhou. We had to get up very early for the train, getting to the station for 6.30am. The train was a double decker with very little legroom for the taller traveller (such as myself). We hadn't had time for breakfast, so we grabbed some spicy beef noodles onboard. All chinese trains i've been on so far seem to offer free hot water for tea and noodles.  Once off the train in hang zhou, we met our tour group outside the station. There must have been about 15 of us in total. It was a chinese tour, so i was the only english person. Once everyone was accounted for, we headed to our first destination xi hu (west lake).  The lake was very pretty, being surrounded by trees and several temples in the distance. We took a small boat to the island in the middle. The island is very special in that it is shaped like a plus sign in a box. This natural shape forms the chinese character for a field. Then inside the island, the areas are separated by water. It was very nice, and we came away with a few photos to show.  Next, we took another boat to the east side of the lake. Here, was a large pond full of carp. There was a lady throwing bread into the water to bring them closer. Some were absolutely huge, one even had a mouth bigger than mine!  Seeing all the fish had made us hungry, so we jumped back into the bus and headed to a local hotel for lunch. A selection of several dishes was brought to our table. It was all nice and not bad considering it was included in the tour price.  After that we went to the main destination of the day Ling yin temple. The temple is one of the most famous and popular temples in china. Unlike some other tourist attractions, ling yin is a real practicing temple where they hold twice monthly ceremonies. The temple has been used by several of the chinese rulers, and some parts of it date back over 1000 years. Inside the buildings i saw some of the largest buddha statues i've ever seen. They have a real presence to them and make you feel very small.  One of the buildings i felt was especially amazing. It was shaped like a cross, and inside had 500 buddha statues. Each one was different, and wherever you stood, you could see at least one of them looking at you. Lots of people come here to pray, and at each building you could see people burning insence and bowing down in front of the buddha's.  Also on the tour, we visited  tea and silk factories. It was good to see how they made their products and we had a go at stretching some silk to be made into a duvet. The fibres were suprisingly strong and could be stretched quite far.  After the tour had finished, we were dropped back at the station ready to head back to shanghai. We had just enough time for a quick dinner of noodles before heading back. This time, we were on the top floor of the train where we met three ladies who were very nice and chatty, they helped the journey to in quickly. Once back at shanghai, we popped into mc donalds for some yoghurt drinks (don't think you can get them in the uk, but they're very nice).  Finally we took the underground back to the hotel, arriving at about 10pm. It was a very long and tiring day, but definitely worth it.  For those recieving this via email, see the attached picture which shows a great spelling mistake i found in shanghai underground station. Ladies, make sure you check your ring size before trying to get on a train!

       Local time 10.00pm tuesday  after a much needed sleep last night, yuqi and i awoke refreshed and ready to see the city properly. Around the corner from the hotel we spotted a small restaurant and popped in for some breakfast. For an amazing 24 yuan (less than 2 pounds) we had some dumplings in soup with a side order of vegetables that yuqi and i had never tried before. It was really really nice, we'll have to eat there again before we leave shanghai :)  after that, it was straight into a taxi and off to see a famous garden in the city called yu yuan. Once out of the taxi, we got a little lost because the garden was inside a pedestrianised shopping area which was surrounded by shops and walls. This meant we couldn't see the garden from outside the shopping street and there were no visible signs either. The area was clearly a tourist hotspot, i saw more western people here than any other place so far. This was reflected in the shops, where every other one i passed had someone shouting "hello hello hello" at me. After working in sales for 4 years, my instincts tell me that's not the best way to get someone into your shop!  Once we'd found the correct place, we crossed a lovely zig-zag bridge into the entrance. The garden itself was absolutely beautiful, with several very traditional buildings. In a couple of places were large ponds, with some of the biggest goldfish i've ever seen! The actual area of the garden was quite small, However the paths twisted and turned all over the place. Often, we'd end up somewhere we'd already seen, but from a different direction. It was a little confusing, but meant we saw the garden from every angle the creators intended.  About 2pm, the temperature was really really hot, so we decided to stop for a drink and then head to "the bund". The bund is an area bordering shanghai's enormous river (huang pu jiang) where you can walk and see the sights. Standing at the bund, looking over the river, you can see the pu dong area of shanghai. This area is the one most people will refer to when talking about shanghai. There are loads of huge skyscrapers, mostly overshadowed by shanghai's most famous building, the tv tower.  The tower stands at over 350m tall (it's taller than that, but that's the highest visitors can go) and is shaped in a very futuristic way. To get to it, we went into a subway and took a small train under the river. The train was obviously designed to be a ride for children and had several lighting effects on the way. Once above ground on the other side of the river, we entered the tv tower. At the bottom of the tower, was a queueing area and gallery where we waited for the lift. Once ready, they squeezed about 20 of us into the rather small lift, and we started our ascent. The lift took us at 7 metres per second up to 263 metres high, causing our ears to pop a couple of times.  The view from the top was spectacular. Although a little hazy, we could see for miles around. Shanghai is a city that takes on a whole new beauty when viewed from above. You just can't imagine how many massive buildings are in shanghai, you'll need to see the many photos i've taken ;)  we neglected to go to the 350 metre viewing gallery owing to the whopping 24 pounds extra to pay. We were quite happy with the view we'd already seen. As a quick reference, the shen yang tv tower took us up 200m compared to the 263m here.  We took another packed lift back to the ground and hopped on the return train under the river. After a couple of short breaks for drinks and ice-cream, we spent the rest of the afternoon browsing a busy shopping street.  We bought a few bits and pieces before heading back to the hotel. We've got an early start tomorrow for our day tour to hang zhou.  Interesting china fact #5 - compared to the english, at a first glance, chinese seems to do a lot of things backwards. Firstly, dates are always given as year, month, day. Similarly, addresses on post are written with the country, province and city at the top, with the road and house number underneath. Beware also, that in buildings, the chinese count the ground floor as the first floor.

       Local time late monday  the spectacular storms last night came at a price, our train arrived 3 hours late into shanghai. Nevertheless, we emerged from the station confident we would have a great time.  The first thing that hit me here was the humidity. It must have been 33 degrees as it felt very sticky indeed. We needed to book into our hotel to ensure we could dump our heavy bags somewhere. We're staying at the hebei hotel which is 5 mins walk from the train station and conveniently designed for travellers from yuqi's home province. The room is a fantastically cheap 148 yuan per night, which is less than 10 pounds!  After a brief encounter with a hotel organised tour guide (who seemed to know less about the area than yuqi did) we decided to shop around for tours ourselves. In the end we found a very helpful company who is taking us to the yellow mountain (huang shen) and another city for a couple of thousand yuan. Not bad for 5 days travel and accommodation :)  other than that, we browsed around a very trendy high street with lots of designer shops and stopped for some food and drink. Later, we went back to the hotel to get cleaned up before seeing shanghai at night.  We left late, after 9 pm to see the city. It's lovely at night, but we left it a little too late to see the significant sights. In the end, we were being approached every 2 mins by someone begging or trying to sell up something, so we headed back to the hotel.  I must say, the shanghai accent is very strange and hard to understand. It's almost a completely different language, sounding a little like japanese. Even yuqi has some difficulty understanding it!  My mobile battery is running low, so that's all i have time for until i can find a chinese plug adapter for it. So goodbye for today :)

       Local time 9.45pm sunday  yuqi and i were awoken this morning to the sound of her 5 year old nephew arriving. He's quite the energetic type, so we weren't able to sleep for much longer.  We spent most of the day organising our trip to shanghai including a fruitless trip to the bank who don't offer a foreign exchange on a sunday (it's worth noting that, unlike the uk, shops here open 7 days a week, often until 9 or 10 at night). After more of yuqi's dad's fantastic fried dumplings for lunch, we headed to the station.  We're now on another overnight sleeper service identical to the others. Yuqi and i are on facing middle bunks. Even though the journey is very long, i'm getting used to the train travel now.  On the way so far we passed through a huge storm. Bright lightning and hail the size of golf balls! It was quite scary at one point, because it sounded like the train was under attack. Hailstones that big make quite a noise when they hit the train windows, i'm suprised they withstood it all!  More tomorrow when i can give you first impressions of shanghai.  Interesting china fact #4 - you can forget english table manners when you're here. It's fine to slurp, belch and make other eating noises. You can drink directly from your bowl and spit bones and seeds directly onto the table. Eating in the uk seems ridiculously formal in comparison!

       Local time 10.20pm thursday  we were so tired after all our travelling, i'm afraid to say i've not got much to report today.  After breakfast, we spent most of the day lounging around, watching tv and chatting. We've just about sorted out our trip to shanghai next week, it all sounds very promising.  For dinner, yuqi's father made some excellent filled dumplings. I have to say, i liked them so much, yuqi remarked i ate more of those than any other food so far here.  As i write this now, it's very cool outside. Although quite a hot day, when we went out for a walk after dinner, it started to rain (up to my old tricks again!) after a while it turned into an impressive storm with thunder and lightning. Now, it's all calmed down, and i'm enjoying the cool air coming through the window.  Gonna have more to report tomorrow :)  interesting china fact #1 - in the cities, a lot of the traffic lights have counters showing the amount of time before the lights change. Should be quite handy for boy racers!

       Local time 8.50pm wednesday  our train pulled into beijing station at 8am. After our previous record of 9 days of sweltering heat and sunshine, it seems i've done my usual trick of taking the weather with me. Rain, rain, rain, rain, oh and it was cold too. I think next time i try to come here, they'll stop me at the airport and say "hey, you're the geezer who makes it pour with rain in the middle of summer" and then put me on a one way flight to the sahara desert where i might be useful.  Anyway, i digress... Despite the weather, we were determined to continue our day as planned. We met yuqi's brother just outside the station who took us for a quick breakfast. After that we went back to his flat to shower, as we were less than fresh after the overnight journey. After watching the nba final on tv, we went out for lunch. The first restaurant we went to had a 50 mins waiting time for duck, so we promptly left to find another. We settled on another very nice restaurant where we met yuqi's brother's girlfriend hao xin. We had a lovely lunch including beijing duck, which i haven't had since last time. Don't believe the restaurants in the uk, most of the so called peking duck is cooked in a cantonese style and is definitely not the same.  After lunch, yuqi and i went off to visit tiananmen square, which took us a lot longer than anticipated. The beijing traffic varies between moving very slowly or not at all. Once at our destination, umbrella in hand, we went over to the imperial palace. Last time i visited the square, i never actually went into the palace for some reason. I was about to find out why that was a mistake!  To get to the palace you need to go through 2 or 3 absolutely huge gates which are impressive in themselves. You've probably seen the gate houses on tv, they're very frequently shown on any programs about china. After the gates into the palace, you realise the scale of the place. The palace is split over several buildings in an area akin to a village. Inside is some amazing architecture and exhibits (and, i must say the nicest tourist toilets i've seen yet) i really feel that any description or pictures will not really convey the scale and beauty of the place, i just hope you can see it for yourselves.   I'm writing this on the train back to shijiazhuang to go back to yuqi's parents house. We pretty much hopped straight on the train after our tour round the palace. We're both exhausted after so much travelling in the last 24 hours, we're looking forward to a relaxing evening. The journey's only 2 hours, which isn't too bad. So, until tomorrow, goodnight!

       Local time 10.05pm tuesday  for breakfast today we went to a tiny cafe close to da bao's flat. I had some beef soup and some really tasty fried meat filled dumplings.  Today, was our last day in shen yang, so we decided to do a little more shopping. We first went into a huge, rather posh shopping mall. We were looking for a new bag for yuqi. This mall had all the top designer names, but we didn't find one to suit.  After a quick stop on the top floor of the mall for a drink and some ice cream, we walked down under the street into what looked like a subway. In fact, it turned out to be a series of long shopping streets under the ground. Probably the best way to describe it is like loads of market stalls arranged in 2 parallel streets over 2 floors. It really was huge, we browsed around for hours, and must have walked a couple of kilometres. The shops were mostly bright and trendy, selling all kinds of clothes, and plenty more besides. Yuqi and i came away with a mirror for her and cute matching flashing mobile phone straps.  We emerged back into daylight exhausted and hungry. We met da bao's wife, son and yuqi's aunty and uncle who were going to treat us for dinner. We went to a very nice restaurant within walking distance from their flat. We had tofu, noodles, beef and some lovely battered pork with a spicy seasoning.  Finally, it was time to say goodbye. We thanked everyone for all their help and left for the station accompanied by da bao. There was a small miscalculation of the train time, and we boarded the train with only a minute to spare. So, now we're on our way to beijing on another night sleeper service, and we're meeting yuqi's brother and girlfriend when we arrive.  I'm sorry to be leaving shen yang. Both jinbo's and da bao's families have been so generous and helpful. I hope i can repay their kindness.

       Local time 00.30am  the main plan for today was simply to get yuqi's and da bao's hair cut. After a small breakfast, we headed down to the same salon as i had used yesterday.  In the end, we were in there for an impressive 6 hours while yuqi had her hair cut and coloured. At the end, yuqi wasn't entirely happy with the result, but i think it looks really nice :)  while i was waiting in the salon, da bao arrived with 3 large boxes which turned out to be gifts for us. There were 2 large original paintings and some coins over 1000 years old! He's really too kind, and i hope i get the chance to show him around the uk one day in return.  We went back to yuqi's aunty's for dinner. It was very nice with some fresh fish and tomato.  After dinner we popped over to the station in a taxi. Yuqi's parents are missing her, so we'll be travelling back tomorrow. It's gonna be a slightly different train journey; we're going to meet yuqi's brother in beijing first, then catch another train back to her parents in shijiazhuang.  Once we sorted out our tickets, we headed back to da bao's flat and stopped at a night grill restaurant on the way. Here, da bao kept refilling my glass with the local beer until i was quite drunk. We also tasted some delicious spicy beef kebabs.  Once my belly was full and i was rather merry on alcohol, we came back ready for bed. Not sure what the plan is tomorrow, more as it happens!

       Local time 11:20am (Actually I'm writing this on Day 8 cos I was so tired when I got back last night!)  We all got up much later than planned today. Our original plan was to be out at 10, we made it out about mid-day. Still, at least we had a good sleep :)  Our first stop was to China's second largest market. After 10 mins in a taxi we arrived outside a quite normal looking four storey building with what seemed like 1,000 bikes parked outside. When we went inside, it quickly became apparent that this building was not normal. To describe the market as huge and colossal would not be doing it justice! The market stalls were spread over all the floors of the building, and then extended over a massive area outside the back of the building. It was rather hot so we did most of our wandering outside. It comprised several narrow streets lined with stalls selling pretty much everything. Food, bags, toys, electrical items - literally everything. It was quite obvious, even to my untrained (and un-fashionable) eye that seemingly designer good on display (like Gucci bags) were fake. But it seemed a resonable way to by some cheap food and clothes.  The market closed at one, so we made our way back to the city centre to do some more shopping. A quick stop for ice-cream and a drink refreshed us before we set off again. We went into a huge mall where Yuqi and I had several photos taken with various amusing cartoon poses. After that, we decided that because of the scorching hot weather it would be a good idea to buy me some shorts. I'm somewhat larger around the waist than your average Chinese it would seem... so it took a lot of browsing to find the pair I'm wearing now. Otherwise we didn't buy very much - apart from a few gifts for you people back home. I'm not telling you what they are though, you'll need to wait and see :)  All that shopping occupied us into the evening. Yuqi and I wanted to treat Da Bao and family to a very special meal as a small token of our appreciation for all they've done for us over the last few days. A while ago I'd noticed Shen Yang's tallest building, the CCTV tower. At over 300m tall it's an impressive structure. What makes it even better, is that at the top it has two observation decks and a revolving restaurant - fantastic! The middle observation deck overlooks the city behind slanted glass windows looking down, it was an absolutely amazing sight seeing Shen Yang lit up at night as far as the eye could see. We also went to the top deck, which is open air. You can stand at the top at over 200m high (which is quite windy, my shirt kept inflating and showing everyone my beer belly) Again, it's a fantastic view - we had our photo's taken professionally for about 2 pounds because my digital camera doesn't handle the night view so well. We should see the photos after a week or so in the post. At one point I stood up against the safety rail and shouted at the top of my voice "Hello China!!"  At the bottom deck, we were seated in the revolving restaurant so we could dine while taking in the wonderful views. The entry price to the tower included the meal for 370 Yuan (about 30 pounds). The meal was large and tasty, and included some of my favourite dumplings and huge king prawns on skewers. I declined to taste the cow's stomach despite everyone reassuring me it was delicious ;)  After the meal, we had a look around some night market stalls before going back and flopping onto the bed.  That's all for now, I just forgot to mention I got my hair cut today as well. You'll see the results in the photos!

       Local time 11:10pm  We woke up quite early today, and had breakfast with Yuqi's cousin, wife and son. I had a quite delicious bowl of noodles with some lovely tender slices of beef. After breakfast we were to meet Da Bao's friend and his month-old baby. It's customary here to celebrate the baby's first month. It turned out to be a much larger event than I had anticipated, with at least 20 people showing up. We were in a lovely city centre restaurant, where they'd booked a room with two large tables just for this. The baby girl was beautiful, and spent most of the time fast asleep - which quite surprised me, because there was much alcohol drinking and merry making :) The was another enormous meal, but it was a bit too soon after breakfast for me, so I couldn't fit enough it. It certainly was impressive though!  After saying our goodbyes, we headed off on the bus to Zhi Wu park. It took us about an hour to get their. Yuqi's three year-old nephew (Li Bo Han) was so well behaved on the bus, he just slept most of the way there. Upon arrival, we bought our tickets and walked for about 15 minutes down quite a long road, until we reached the water bridges. The best way to describe the water bridges is like an adventure playground for all ages, over water. There were several chain bridges and floating platforms to run across (Or more often, have your friends make you fall off by wobbling them from the other side). Me, being big and clumsy was too much of a scaredy cat to try any of them. One of them looked particularly dangerous - being a series of very large cylinders covered in rope above the water. The cylinders were, of course, free to rotate as people attempted to run across and had just enough space in between to fall into the water if you made a mistake. Needless to say, if I can chin myself by falling out a shower - this was not a good idea for me!  In the end, Yuqi and Da Bao found a really long tightrope bridge with two cables above on either side to hold onto. The whole thing had a net underneath so you wouldn't fall out. It looked a good idea at the time, but once I was on it ... it was absolutely terrifying! It was really quite long, high up and had about 5 other people on it. Of course, the others thought it was hilarious to make the tightrope wave from side-to-side with the foreigner in the middle clinging on for dear life. Although much slower than Da Bao and Yuqi, I did make it across eventually. Next time, I think I'll stick to the ground!  As if I'd not scared myself enough, across the bridge were a few fairground rides. Naturally, I spotted the one which hurled you around upside down ;) I persuaded Yuqi to join me and we strapped ourselves in. Obviously everyone else had used their better judgement, and we were the only passengers - chest restraint in place, they started the ride. It had two axis of rotation - one in the middle, and another at the platform we were seated on. This meant the ride operator could leave us in the amusing position of being stationary, upside down about 10 metres above the ground. The operator also loved my screams so much, he did it 4 times. I've got a great photo of it to show you all - I think I'll be able to upload some when I travel back to ShiJiaZhuang.  After a couple of other smaller rides, we headed home on the bus and had dinner with Yuqi's uncle and Aunt. They had kindly cooked me some chicken and chips to help me ease into the Chinese diet a little easier. We had a lovely long chat which included her uncle and Da Bao playing some traditional Chinese musical instruments (fantastic!) It's late now, so I'll leave it at that - hope everyone is good back home! Bye for now!

       Local time 11:24  After leaving Jinbo's family yesterday, we me Yuqi's cousin Da Bao, his wife, and son and his parents, Yuqi's aunt and uncle. Da bao took us to his parents house which was to be our room for the night. It was early evening so after the introductions we headed down to the local restaurant. We had an absolutely enormous meal, including tofu, pork ribs, delicious filled dumplings and several vegetables. It was really very nice and I felt guilty that the hot weather had really reduced my appetite. Still, the leftovers didn't go to waste; they were taken home to be eaten later.  After the meal, Yuqi, Da bao and me went to a large shopping mall to play some arcade games. After a gruelling air hockey match, motorcycle racing and a brief go on point blank 2 - they turned off the power to all the games to get us to leave! We then, walked down a very large pedestrianised shopping street. We took a lift above the shops into a large pool and snooker centre. We played three games of pool, and I'm happy to report I lost every single one! After my dreadful defeat, we went home to sleep.  This morning we woke up very early, and had breakfast together at Yuqi's Auntie's house. After that, we popped back to Da Bao's appartment to quickly use his computer and check our emails. The main event for the day was to visit Huang tai Ji's tomb which is situated in the middle of the city in a large park. After a short taxi ride, we arrived and started to look around. The weather was very hot, but there was a cool breeze which prevented the 33 degree temperature from being too overwhelming. The tomb itself is very impressive and comprises several traditionally styled buildings with some very intricate and beautiful stonework. I've got several photos - again, which will be revealed as soon as I can download them from my camera.  We were a little hungry after the tomb, so we decided to go for food. We went to a really very posh Korean style restuarant. Inside, it was styled very traditionally with rooms with low tables and chairs separated by sliding doors. We were given a huge selection of snacks ranging from sushi to spicy leaves. The meat was delivered to our table and grilled on hot coals in the centre of the table. It really was fantastic, and for the 9pounds price tag, great value for money.  finally, we headed back to Yuqi's Auntie's house for dinner and had a great long relaxing conversation over beer and a couple of VCD's. Now, we're just about to go to bed, so I'll update again tomorrow. Zai jian :)

       Local time 3.10pm after a good nights sleep, yuqi and i awoke at about 8am. We had breakfast downstairs in the hotel. It was a passable buffet with very watered down fruit colour water being advertised as "juice".  We met jinbo, his mum and a different driver to yesterday. The traffic in shen yang centre was in chaos due to some elderly people demonstrating against the government's poor benefits for them. Because of this we scrapped our original plan to look around the city. Instead, jinbo was going to take us to some caves. We departed just after nine, and it was an uneventful 3 hour drive to ben xi where the cave is situated. We stopped for a quick lunch on the way, a break was nice as the poor condition of some of the roads had left us somewhat dizzy :) we arrived, parked and took a small electric car to the cave mouth. It was a huge magnificent opening in the side of a mountain with a small lake beside it. I've got some great pictures to follow on the website soon. The cave itself is called the shui dong (water cave) as the length of it is 2m deep with crystal clear water. We were given thick coats to wear as it was only 10 degrees c inside. We boarded a small electric boat and started the 2.8km long journey into the depths of the earth. Inside it was absolutely spectacular, and a little scary. With massive stalagtites towering above us, it made us feel really small and fragile. The limestone ranged from green to a beautiful creamy white colour, and all the major formations had been given names by the explorers. At times, the cave ceiling and stalagtites were so low, we all had to duck to avoid being hit. At the end, the boat turned around and took us back out. Back at the cave entrance we paused for A photo or two and headed back out into the sunshine. Going from 10 to 30+ degrees in seconds is quite an interesting feeling. As i write this, we're in the car on the way back to shen yang. We're going to have dinner when we arrive then leave jinbo who's travelling to beijing to work. After that, yuqi and i will be visiting more of her family. More about that later ...

       Local time 11.37pm this is the story of my day in shen yang (home of jinbo) and how i ended it with no clothes on in front of several middle aged chinese men. After arriving on the train at 8am, we were greeted by jinbo, his dad and a driver. We deposited our luggage in the car and headed off for breakfast. It was a buffet in a local hotel, certainly not bad- i had soup, dumplings and several vegetables. After breakfast, jinbo's dad went off to work, and the three of us were left with his driver and the car. Jinbo had decided to take us to the qian shan (the thousand mountains) the drive was long and hot. A main road was closed for repair, so we had to divert across a small, poor, dirt track village. The driver, new to this territory took a few wrong turns. But, after some helpful direction from the locals we were soon on our way. As a sidenote, the poor village really highlighted the difference in the quality of life of china's population. Shen yang is a huge sprawling metropolis (it apparently takes 2 hours to drive through it) but the small village had dirty small houses that were falling apart. While some enjoy the impressive skyscrapers, others can barely feed thier families. We arrived at qian shen after 2 1/2 hours. The moment we pulled into the car park, we were surrounded by guides trying to get us to hire them. We got out, and the driver bought the tickets and organised a guide. Qian shen is a very large mountain range (hence the thousand in its name) and the part we visited was a buddhist colony. The climb to the top was more than 1300 steps, which is not easy in the burning midday sun. Anyhow, we made it to the top and got some beautiful photos (to follow when i have access to a computer) after coming back down to ground level, we were absolutely exhausted. We'd not showered or changed our clothes since yesterday morning (there was no facility for that on the overnight train journey) i was certainly rather sticky and not nice on the nose :) after the 2 hour drive back to shen yang city, we met jinbo's parents and popped into kfc (yes, a chinese kfc- not very exciting, it's very similar to the uk but only about £1 for a meal deal!) where we had a drink and some ice cream to recover. Finally, jinbo's dad took all of us to a public bathhouse to unwind. It's a huge multistorey building, very modern and expensive looking. As we walked in, we took off our shoes, and an assistant took me up some very posh looking stairs to the changing room. The women separated off the the ladies area, and i went into the mens. Much to my suprise, the assistant opened my locker and waited. Looking around, to my horror, i had to strip completely starkers! The assistant took my smelly clothes and stacked them in our locker. Then i followed jinbo's dad into the main spa area which had about 20 middle aged bare chinese men. Once i got over the shock, it was all very relaxing and just what we needed after such a long day. I relaxed in the spa, showered, brushed my teeth and went into the sauna. ... Then pretty promptly came out again. It was my first time in a sauna and not entirely what i expected. The steam was very herbal smelling and seemed to go right through my head. The steam was so hot it was burning my eyes, but i left feeling refreshed. After drying off, we were dressed in some white cotton shirts and trousers (complete with paper underwear) finally, we proceeded to the 8th floor to eat. It was a busy buffet where you can bring raw ingredients to your table. Each person has a pot of boiling water to cook it in any combination you want. It was really very nice, and we were all tasting each others concoctions. After the meal, we changed back into our normal clothes and had a quick walk around a local park in the cool evening air. Yuqi and i were dropped off at our hotel which gives us an 11th floor view of the city, certainly not bad for £30ish. Yuqi's trying to sleep now, so i must stop tapping away on my phone. So, goodnight for now :)

       Local time 5.35am i'm awake at this as before unheard of hour. I'm still on the train and wide awake when the sun came up. The site of mist covered rice fields as far as the eye can see is quite amazing. I tried to take a picture, but my camera couldn't handle the combination of low light and a fast moving train. Other than that, the scenery is very monotonous - when outside of the cities, it's all been flat, boring farmland. We've still got another 2 hours to go :( one thing i forgot to mention in yesterday's log, was the chinese art of queueing, or rather lack of it. If the english have pioneered organised queueing, the chinese have thier own brand of disorganised mobbing. I've noticed this on several occasions. The first was at heathrow airport, they called the first few seats, yet *everyone* got up and jammed the doorway. Next, when the plane landed in beijing, they announced "please remain in your seats with your belts fastened", so everyone immediately stood up and started gathering thier baggage while the plane was still in motion. And yesterday afternoon, getting onto the train platform involved pushing through hordes of other pushing people. I found that if i paused for a moment, i could always feel someone behind me start to push me forwards. My advice to the future china traveller - if you've got seats booked, wait for the mob to go, then leisurely go and take your seat in peace and quiet. Trust me, it works for us :)

       Local time 9.55pm we're still on the train, they've just turned the lights out to let us sleep. The train has stopped at tian jin station (about 30 mins from beijing). My miniscule bed is getting quite uncomfortable. What doesn't help is that the old couple beneath us are snoring like angry tigers (not me this time!) this is really quite boring, i'm really looking forward to arriving now :)  i ate a small dinner served on a sectioned metal tray. It comprised tofu, green peppers, pork and rice. It was passable enough for the 15 yuan price (1 pound) well, we're on the move again, i'll try and sleep now. For those of you reading this by email, i attach a picture of my bunk.

       Local time 5pm  later last night, we went to the local supermarket. We needed to buy a few supplies. Once again, i was greeted with stares. At one point the staff gathered round to look at us, while (badly) pretending to go about their business. We both woke up quite early today and had breakfast (zao fan) with yuqi's mum. I had some lovely fried pancakes filled with spring onion and some really creamy fresh milk (niu nai). We discussed how strange it is having everyone stop and stare all the time. We decided the best course of action is to ignore them and concentrate on enjoying ourselves. After lunch we prepared our things for our train journey. Packing enough for 2 people into 1 backpack is quite a challenge! Next, rather than carrying around hordes of cash (which is like holding a sign saying "please rob me") yuqi decided to open a bank account so we could use card rather than cash. We deposited 4000 yuan (about 300 pounds) to keep us going. At 3 o'clock we took a taxi to the station to catch the train. Shijiazhuang station is quite large and very very busy. Imagine a medium size english station with enough people to fit inside london paddington and that's almost what it's like. The train itself is quite a long one with very tall carriages. Each carriage has about 10 compartments with 6 bunk beds. Three on each wall facing each other. Yuqi and i have facing middle bunks, with a somewhat elderly couple below us. Getting into the bunk was quite fun, it's high up, and there's not enough room for me to sit up!  The train is very clean and modern, just as well as i'm on it for 16 hours. I'm going to lay in my bunk now and watch china fly by the window, i'll update again soon. For now, zai jian!

       Local time 5.09pm we both woke up quite late today, the jet lag is setting in. We had a glorious lunch with yuqi's parents and sister. Chicken and green pepper, fresh prawns, shredded fried potato, chinese bread, egg and tomato soup and some courgette. Suffice it to say, we were quite full!  After relaxing a while, yuqi and i went for a walk around the local area. First stop was the bank, to get enough yuan for a few days. The bank clerks had clearly not had much (any?) experience with english currency and wouldn't exchange yuqi's 20 pound notes because of a small rip in the top. The exchanged 200 pounds of my travellers cheques ok, the rate is a favourable 1 pound to 15 yuan, giving me more than 3000 to play with. Next, we took a taxi to a local travel bureau to book train tickets for our next city visit; shen yang. Tickets cost 237 yuan for a night sleeper service as the journey is about 12 hours. The clerk didn't understand my chinese and was quite rude, but yuqi sorted it all out :) finally, we walked back along the busy shijiazhuang side streets. I'd forgotten how unusual it is to have a foreigner in some areas. Most people stopped what they were doing just to stare at me walking past. It's definitely a strange feeling, and destroys any sense of settling in. Anyhow, i'm not too worried, i'll get used to it... I did last time i travelled to china.

       Just a quickie, i've now arrived in china. I'm currently cruising southwards from beijing with yuqi and her sister. I arrived at the airport at 1.30 local time, and now it's 3.25, my body clock has to adjust to the 7 hours time difference. So, we're off to shijiazhuang to yuqi's parents house. I look forward to meeting everyone!

       Today's the day! Our flight out to China is at 20:25 tonight, due to arrive 13:30 Beijing time on Sunday.  I'm having mobile phone problems at the moment, but I'm hoping to be able to update this blog often in China.  It was nice to see everyone last night, and was great to meet Wendy, Graham and Catherine (And the Kung-Fu guy - whose name escapes me) It was a shame we had to leave relatively early, but we've got a bit of preparing to do!  So, goodbye from the UK and hopefully the next update will be after my arrival half-way round the world!

       As i write this, yuqi, dad and i are in a large van hurtling along the a38 to exeter. After a hectic morning packing and loading, we're finally on our way. We're gonna arrive mid afternoon and unload at the new house. Then, we'll be staying at my old rented house in woodley. We're looking forward to seeing as many old reading friends as possible before we fly out on saturday.

       Local time late monday - 1 day left  it's all over :( this morning was all about packing our suitcases ready to go.  We've gained a lot during this month, and i'm suprised we managed to fit it all into our two suitcases. Still, we managed and the two cases are just about full to bursting point  after lunch, me, yuqi, her parents and sister took two taxis to shijiazhuang station for our 3 hour trip back. We were to stay in beijing tonight before flying out tomorrow afternoon. We said our goodbyes, thanked everyone and set off.  The train journey was uneventful, and we arrived in beijing without a hitch. Yuqi's brother wang zheng was waiting for us, and took us to our room for the night. In his apartment block, there were rooms available for short stays, so we were able to have a very nice room just opposite from his room.   We chatted for a while and set off for dinner. We thought we'd sample a chinese pizza hut to give my belly a change. Jinbo is working in beijing, so we invited him and two of his housemates along. Pizza hut here is very similar to the uk (with similar prices, expensive for china). I did notice they can serve snails as a starter, which i didn't want to try :)  after the meal, we all walked to a pedestrianised shopping street. It's very well known, and i'd actually been before in 2002. We sat and drank beer until bedtime.

       Local time 10pm sunday - 2 days left.  We were awoken this morning with the sound of yuqi's nephew zhou xun arriving. After breakfast, we spent much of the morning watching his automan and cartoon vcd's.  Today, yuqi had a final dentist appointment. So, early in the afternoon we headed off to the dental hospital. The hospital itself was much bigger than any dentists i've seen in the uk. A large very square building over several floors. The treatment seemed to take place in 2 large rooms on the second floor. Unlike the uk, there were several dentists separated by partitions like in an office.  After the first phase of treatment was complete, we headed off to a shopping mall to get some new sunglasses for yuqi. We eventually settled on a very unusual and cool pair. Then, we popped into the supermarket to get some food for our journey (and some more for a few lucky people back home!).  Finally, it was back to the dentist for yuqi, before heading back for dinner. After all their hospitality and kindness, today was our turn to buy a meal before we went. We'd asked them to find a special restaurant just for our last meal. It was me, yuqi, her parents and her sister together with her husband and son. The restaurant was very local, and we had our own room on the 3rd floor with a single large circular table. We ate some very fresh fish, pigs ears (suprisingly nice), tofu, spicy lamb, pork with clear noodles, pork and radish balls, sweet fried cakes and soup. It was huge and delicious, a great last meal!  While we were eating, there was a thunderstorm. Luckily, it had come and gone by the time we'd finished. So we walked home in the cool evening air. It was quite late when we got back, so we fell asleep very quickly. Our last night to sleep in shijiazhuang in yuqi's parents apartment.

       Local time 9.35pm saturday - 3 days left  today's main plan was simply to go shopping to get a few last things before we have to go back to the uk. So, after a quick breakfast, yuqi, me, and her parents set off in a taxi. It was quite a long drive to the shopping mall, it was the other side of the city.  The first mall we went to had a series of small stalls. Yuqi bought some jewelry and i bought a replacement accessory for my phone. I'd previously bought a flashing monkey, but somewhere between shanghai and here, the flashing bit fell off.  I have to say that i thought the uk cities were busy on saturdays, but i hadn't seen anything until china! Each mall was absolutely swarming with people, if you stopped for a minute, there'd be a build up of people behind you trying to push you along.  Next, we went into a second, newer mall. Here i bought a music cd, and looked around a few other stalls. After all this, it was lunchtime already, so we headed back home in a taxi.  After i tried donkey meat, i felt brave enough to try something new, something unusual, something i couldn't eat in the uk. So what was to be the next meat to taste...  Attention animal lovers... It's dog! Yes our friendly furry friend served up on a plate! Actually, contrary to popular belief in the uk, dog is not that common here. It's a particular delicacy from the north of china, and is difficult to find and expensive elsewhere. It's also not any old dog, it's a particular breed bred just for eating (as with beef for example).  Yuqi's parents knew of a restaurant that served dog, but when we arrived the restaurant was empty (never a good sign here) and the menu expensive, so we left. On our travels to another restaurant, yuqi's dad spotted a tiny restaurant on a side street. After a quick inspection of the menu, we sat down to eat. The restaurant specialised in korean style cooking, and served us dog, spicy dried fish, aubergine and cabbage all with spicy dips. The dog was a dark meat similar in colour and texture to duck meat. It tasted very nice, it was very tender and went very well with the spicy dip. We also ate an enormous bowl of korean style cold noodles which are served in a slightly sweet tasting soup with egg and corriander. Marvellous!  Once we were all stuffed, we went back home to relax for a while. It turned out that the flashing monkey i bought for my phone earlier was missing a clip, so needed to be taken back. Yuqi and her mum wanted to buy a few more things, so we went together.  On the way back, the traffic was terrible. In a crucial road under a railway bridge, a large drain cover had broken, causing chaos. Still, we got there eventually and got me a new monkey. Then, we travelled to another mall, and got caught in traffic due to an accident in the same place as earlier! But once there, we browsed around for a couple of hours getting yuqi and her mum some new clothes.  As we exited the mall, it had just started to rain, so we took a taxi home for dinner. We got home quite late (8.30ish) but yuqi's dad had cooked dinner ready. It was very nice, and my belly is very happy as i sit here writing this.

       Local time 9.45pm friday - 4 days left  with no zhou xun this morning, we slept in a little. Today was expected to reach a scorching 36 degrees, so for most of the day we stayed in the relatively cool apartment.  At 4pm, when it was starting to cool down, we left for the shops. We wanted to get a new mobile for yuqi, her current panasonic was a bit too big. On her sisters advice, we took a taxi to a special high street. Unlike most high streets in the uk, where you can find 5 or 6 mobile retailers at best, this street had nothing but mobile phones!  China has so many different mobile phones and manufacturers, you are certainly spoilt for choice. As well as the big uk names like motorola and nokia, there's amoi, bird and haier to name a few. Small flip phones seem to be big here, and motorola is very very popular, much more so than the uk.  Yuqi had already fallen in love with the panasonic g51, being small, pink and cute. So really we were just looking through the various shops to find the best price. As it happened, after browsing for a while, yuqi's sister phoned. She has a friend in the mobile phone business who could beat everyone elses prices. So, we met her sister and headed to the 18th floor of a rather large building to meet the friend. In the end, we got the phone for 1000 yuan (67 pounds -bargain!). It's very nice, has a colour screen and some really funny ringtones.  So, yuqi now ecstatic at her new toy, we left for home. We all had dinner together, then went for a walk to the river in the evening air. I have to say it's still hotter than an average british day, even though it's nearly 10pm at night!  Interesting china fact #12 - a lot of chinese words are formed from the idea behind an object. For example, the chinese for computer (dian nao) means electric brain, train (huo che) means fire vehicle and mobile phone (shou ji) means hand machine.

       Local time 9.10pm thursday  yuqi and i were awoken this morning by zhou xun bursting into our room and telling us we were lazy, at 8am. So, we got up, showered and had breakfast.  The weather today was a vast improvement on yesterday, being sunny and not too hot. We had decided to take zhou xun to a park to play, so us three hopped into a taxi across the city.  The park was small but clean and had a large playground. We paid the 5 yuan (33p) entrance fee and went in. Zhou xun being 5 years old and full of energy, bounced, climbed, slid and ran around for a couple of hours.  For lunch, we had planned to treat him to a pizza hut meal which he'd never had before. However, he was adamant that he wanted kfc. So, it was off again in a taxi to the nearest kfc.  I have to say that for a 5 year old, he has an impressive appetite; he ate more than did! The kfc is very similar to the uk, but about a third of the price. I found the meat was darker and flavoured slightly of lemon, i guess to cater for the chinese taste.  After lunch, we wandered around some shops (at last finding some shaving gel, i can look almost respectable again!). Having zhou xun with us meant buying sweets, a bug's life video and playing some arcade games.  After the shopping we came back to the apartment to let zhou xun sleep a while. He had other plans however, and we ended up watching a bug's life together until yuqi's parents came home.  For dinner today, among other things, we had some new pancakes i hadn't tasted before. They were very large, about a foot square. We filled them with pork, onion, corriander and lettuce. The pork was in a really nice black bean sauce and the whole thing was rolled up to be eaten. Very nice indeed.  We're relaxing now zhou xun's gone home, tv says temperature is gonna be 36 tomorrow!  Interesting china fact #11 - in a lot of shops, you can see a small figure of a fat golden cat waving. The chinese believe it is a good omen, to bring prosperity.

       Local time 10.30pm wednesday  yuqi needed another trip to the dentist this morning, so it was up to me to look after her nephew zhou xun for a few hours.  He was very well behaved, he showed me his collection of automan (a japanese cartoon superhero) figures. We also watched several chineses cartoons together, i couldn't understand what was going on, but he was certainly enjoying himself.  Yuqi and her parents were back in time for lunch, so we all ate together. It was constantly raining, so we didn't go out until the weather improved in the evening. Then, it was a quick walk to the supermarket for some shaving gel. I'd run out a couple of days ago, and was starting to look very hairy.  I almost forgot to mention we were visited by yuqi's parents neighbours. They popped in to say hello and were very friendly. I'll have to get to know them a bit better when we have a bit more time.  Tomorrow, we're taking zhou xun to the park, and treating him to pizza for lunch. Should be fun :)
