      Hi, it's me.   I rented Viewtiful Joe and Splinter Cell over the week, and figured I'd throw out a mini-review on each. I'll give a little bit of info on the different aspects of each game. I'll also throw out a grade, say whether I recommend a purchase or not, and examine what audience would most appreciate the game.  I've even thought up a rating system:    Rating System   A = Jon Stewart B = Dane Cook C = Dennis Leary D = Jeff Foxworthy (w/o redneck jokes) F = Jay Mohr    First,  Splinter Cell: Pandora Tommorow . It follows the story of government agent Sam Fisher and his anti-terrorist activities. The game is a thrid-person shooter with huge emphasis on stealth; you will not survive a level without sneaking through it. The first level's objectives even include that you can not be seen by any enemy guards. So, if you're not into the stealth genre, then there's not much here for you. The gameplay didn't do it for me. At first I felt overwhelmed by the complexity of the controls, but by the end of the first mission I had them pretty much figured out. The first mission is fairly tough; it seems that it was designed for vets who played the previous Splinter Cell and knew what was going on with the storyline. You basically have to memorize the level, know where all the baddies are and whatnot. It is pretty much a trial-and-error process, which I disliked. The graphics on the game are incredible, however, as is the presentation and audio aspects. If you liked the first game, you'd easily love this one.    Grade: B   Next up is  Viewtiful Joe , for Gamecube.  Viewtiful Joe  is a unique 3D side-scroller. You play the role of Joe, who has been transported into his favorite movie to rescue his girlfriend. Yes, the story is simple, but it provides the motivation that the player needs to go through the game: beat up the bad guys to save the girl. You can slow down and speed up time using powers called VFX - that is to say, basically Matrix bullet-time. The game gets addictive after you learn all of these; beating up 15 on-screen robots at the same time at blazing speeds is quite satisfying. The game is cel-shaded, and presents a graphics tone reminiscent of a comic book. It is generally childish in nature, but that isn't to say that the game is easy. The boss battles take a lot of time to beat, and the levels aren't very repetitive. If you can get past the childish nature of the game, then this game is great.   Grade: A+

      I have to go to have a meeting with my army recruitment seargent later today. I missed (skipped) out on my appointment with him last week. Of course, he called me again to set up a new meeting date. It's in 8 hours. I'm thinking of what to tell the guy when I get there... "Uh, yeah, sir? The only reason I sent the brochure back to you was because I wanted the free Marines knit hat." For some reason, I don't think that will fly. Something about army seargants really intimidates me. I've actually met the guy before, he was really nice. That was before I stood him up, though.   In other news, I've begun reading the book that my wonderful girlfriend Stephanie lent me while she's away in Europe,  Rainbow Six  by Tom Clancy.  Rainbow Six  is a book about an international counter-terrorist group called Rainbow. All of the members are the best that their respective countries' militaries have to offer. I haven't gotten that far in the book, but so far it's been extremely fun to read.  Better get to bed, fun day tommorow(today, technically).

       Pop singer and brother of Backstreet Boy Nick Carter, Aaron Carter, is apparently dating Hulk Hogan's daughter, Brooke Bollea.   In an article in US Weekly, it was revealed that Hulk Hogan chaperones dates between the two, and is aware that his daughter's boyfriend also went out with Hilary Duff and Lindsay Lohan.   "I told him, 'I know this isn't your first BBQ, But you better act like you don't know how to cook, or it's going to be curtains for your skinny little ass," Hogan stated to the magazine.    This news article has inspired me. I proudly present to you:    HULK HOGAN v. AARON CARTER    ----PART I----   Week 1: Royal Rumble ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  For weeks, Eric Bishoff has bragged about how he has a "surprise contestant" who will be entering the Royal Rumble match. No one knows who it is, as Bischoff does not drop ANY hints, but simply says that this signing will be huge for RAW. The Royal Rumble match begins, and everyone enters at their scheduled number. As the 2-minute countdown for entrant 30 starts, there are still 6 wrestlers left in the ring - Chris Jericho, Triple H, Rob Van Dam, Big Show, Rey Mysterio, and Randy Orton. HHH clotheslines Mysterio over the top, and immediately after this, Orton betrays him and throws him out as well. While this is happening, Jericho and RVD are fighting, with RVD gaining the upper hand; eventually, RVD goes for a kick, Jericho grabs his foot, pulls him in, and locks on the Liontamer. Orton and Big Show begin to fight as well. As the countdown reaches zero, Big Show chokeslams Orton, Jericho, and RVD. Big Show stands dominate in the ring... and then the music plays. Jimi Hendrix's "Voodoo Child" blares throughout the speakers, and Hulk Hogan makes his triumphant return to the ring. An expression of pure shock overcomes Big Show's face. Hogan takes his time coming down to the ring. As he steps into the ring, he stands up to Big Show. They trash talk a little, and Show goes for a punch. Hogan blocks it and sends back three of his own, whips him into the ropes, and hits a big boot. He signals to the crowd, bounces off the ropes, and hits the Leg Drop of Doom. He then picks up Orton and tosses him. Jericho goes after him, but Hogan sidesteps, and clotheslines him over the top. RVD is back up, and is eliminated by Big Show. Hogan and Show brawl, and eventually, Show locks his hand on Hogan's neck for the chokeslam. As Show lifts him up, Hogan manages to get out of the hold. Show turns around, charges for Hogan, misses, and Hogan tosses him to win the 2005 Royal Rumble, and gain the number 1 contender spot. Crowd goes nuts, and Hogan poses in the ring.    RAW: The Next Night ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Hogan makes a speech. He explains to the crowd that he had to come back for one last ride, and to try to beat Chris Benoit for the World Title at Wrestlemania. Again. He is interrupted by Eric Bischoff, who is in full asshole mode. He tells Hogan that the only reason he's still around is because of them. He cites the NWO as a major example, and also says that he only got to participate in the Royal Rumble because of him. Hogan takes exception to this, and says that the only people Hogan has to thank are the fans. Bischoff continues to agitate him, until Hogan lays him out, and delivers a leg drop. Later that night, Bischoff promises revenge on Hogan next week.   RAW: 2 Weeks After Royal Rumble ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Bischoff announces that Hogan will be facing a mystery opponent tonight. Hogan shows up for the main event against his mystery opponent. His mystery opponent turns out to be Kane. They wrestle an even match. At the end of the match, Big Show does a run-in, and destroys Hogan. This ends the show.   RAW: 2 Weeks before No Way Out ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Eric Bischoff announces that he has traded Batista, Ric Flair, and Randy Orton to Smackdown in exchange for Big Show. He books Hulk Hogan v. Big Show at No Way Out, with the winner gaining the number 1 contender spot, and facing Chris Benoit for the World Title at Wrestlemania. He also books Hogan and Edge versus Big Show and HHH for later that night. The tag match is won when Edge speared and pinned HHH.   RAW: Before No Way out ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Hogan is scheduled for a main event match with HHH. It is an even match, until the referee is knocked out. Big Show runs in, and is about to chokeslam Hogan, when Edge makes the save. He spears Show, then HHH, and Hogan wins the match. Show is angry.   No Way Out ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Big Show and Eric Bishoff discuss a "plan." Hogan and Show's match comes up. They fight an even match. Big Show hits a chokeslam, but Hogan kicks out. Hogan hits a leg drop. When it looks like he is about to win, who else but Aarron Carter interferes, hits Hogan with a microphone, and costs Hogan the match. Hogan is shocked, as No Way Out comes to a close with the image of the young Carter laughing manaically.   ----END PART I----    Need sleep. Look for Part 2 sometime over the weekend.

       When I buy a new video game, I want it to be a good investment. Buying a game I dislike is a huge waste of money. Buying a game I like, however, can result in hours of pointless fun. Whenever I am considering purchasing a new game, I do research. I check reviews for the game, look for any discounts on it, get other people's opinions, everything. Call me a greedy Jew, but I like my money, and don't tend to waste it on what I will not like.    Today, I went to my local EB (Electronics Boutique if you're nasty) to trade in some of my old PS2 games. All of them were either games I've completed, no longer enjoyed, or never enjoyed to begin with. All seven of them were in mint condition; the cases were neat, instruction manuals were perfect, and the DVD's were scratchless. I gathered them together, figuring that I would probably make a cool fifteen dollars on each, maybe ten at the least. I mean, these were all games I paid full price for, getting one-fifth of what they are worth sounded accurate. Well, at least, that's what I thought. But then again, I spend my time writing this to absolutely no one, so what I think isn't really valid. Anyway, I drove off to my local EB, happy and giddy. That would soon change.  The store was busy, which surprised me, because usually there is no one in there, and the only thing you hear is the conversation of how Employee One's Knight totally PWN3D Employee Two's Mage last night on Everquest. So having other people there was cool. I proceeded to an available cashier. Considering the dismal look on his face, this guy did not look like he wanted to be there. His clothes were black, his fingernails were painted black, he was wearing black eyeliner, and his hair was a dyed-black mohawk. He was wearing a name tag, but I forget what it said. So we'll just call him "Happy." ROFLMAO WTF BBQ LOL2004. God I'm hilarious. He just sorta stared at me, not really saying anything. So I told him that I would like to trade in my games. I gave him my games, and waited for the total to come back. As I waited, I thought of what I could do with the money. Buy a better video game? Hell yeah! Or maybe I could even buy a stereo? Sweet! Hey, I could even build myself a castle! Um, no, not really. Before I could think of anything else (I'm a slow thinker), Happy spoke up. He muttered, in the most condescending voice imaginable; "You're total is... twenty-two dollars." My eyes widened. "How much was that?" "Twenty-two dollars. Do you want that in store credit or cash?" Jesus tapdancing Christ, twenty-two dollars??? What the hell can I get for twenty-two dollars??? So much for my castle. "I'll take that in cash." Some gas money, I thought. But even that plan had to be ruined by Happy. "If you take it in cash, twenty percent is taken off." Son of a bitch. For those of you who haven't passed basic mathematics, taking twenty percent off of twenty-two dollars would leave me with seventeen-sixty. So I opted to take it in store credit. As I turned to leave the store, Happy wished me a nice day. I'm sure he meant it. Asshole.  Below, the amounts I received back for the games are listed. Keep in mind that I paid a full fifty dollars for them at the time of purchase.  Ghost Recon - $5.00 Virtua Fighter 4 - $1.00 XIII - $3.00 UFC Throwdown - $2.00 Romance of the Three Kingdoms 7 - $3.00 Resident Evil: Dead Aim - $5.00 Return to Castle Wolfenstein - $3.00  Doing the math, I lost  $328.00 .   Moral of the Story   Don't trade in games that you don't like; instead, just don't buy games that you won't like. Not sure about a game? Rent it or something. Borrow it from a friend. Just don't get stiffed THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT FUCKIN DOLLARS.
