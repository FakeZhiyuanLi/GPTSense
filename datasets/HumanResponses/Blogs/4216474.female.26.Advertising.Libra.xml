       They say confession is good for the soul, so here goes...  Hi, my name is Rachel, and I'm an eHarmony-aholic. [Slight pause while you say, "Hi, Rachel."] I very recently began suspecting this based on a conversation I will tell you about below. But first, let me say this is not easy for me to admit and I'd appreciate it if any sarcastic or otherwise condescending comments would be kept as vague and gentle as possible...  So I was talking with my mom last night and telling her about two guys I'm in the talking-on-the-phone stage with, when suddenly I realized that I was feeling just a little embarrassed. Now we all know that I have never (well, at least not since the inception of the Post-Jackhole-Boyfriend Liberation Era) had an issue with communicating with - and yes, even casually dating - more than one guy at the same time. I view it as consolidation, or if you prefer, wise time management principles. The beginning stages of a relationship are really more like a job interview than anything else, so why not interview several candidates at once? I can see it now, sitting in my office with a clipboard on my lap, the nervous interviewee sitting across from me...  "So, tell me in your own words," I would say, "what are the three best traits you bring to a relationship?"  "Would you be willing to make some slight changes to your hair and wardrobe if we became seriously involved?"  "Mr. Jackhole, do you have any references?" (Man, how I would have LOVED to have seen that guy's references beforehand! And no, his name wasn't really Jackhole. Names have been changed to protect the unknowing.)  But isn't that exactly what dating websites allow you to do? You are able to screen candidates in a completely safe and anonymous way, and learn quite a bit about a person before you ever meet them. IF you ever meet them. Granted, no references are available...but for some reason it's just easier to evaluate compatibility while staring at a computer screen than when you're staring into his big blue eyes. And maybe that's why I'm drawn to this method - because it's more, well, clinical than my natural style, which has in the past resembled something that for the sake of space I will simply refer to as "kamikaze dating".  The stakes are high, any way you look at it. Either you get way too involved way too soon, and then feel like you're ripping off your right arm when you break up...or (as I have more recently experienced) you grow weary from lots of first dates. As my wise friend Amy once said, "It's a whole lot of excitement, and very little familiarity." And I want the familiarity. Maybe that's why I was embarrassed...because I'm tired of giving family and friends the "stats" on this guy or that guy, when all I really wanted to start out with was one guy...when my goal this whole time has been to find that one guy I could be with for awhile, and - yes - maybe even marry one of these days.  But something else my wise friend Amy (maybe I'll start referring to her as My Own Personal Buddha) said comes to mind. "It never works out UNTIL it works out, and it only has to work out once." Smart girl, that Amy. So. I'm hanging out. Even though I'm weary, I still wait in hope for the day when I will exhale, and know that this is the man with whom I will share the rest of my life. That'll be a good day.  (And by the way, just so you know and won't be totally shocked when I break the news, that glorious day will probably be at the Elvis Presley Chapel O' Love in Las Vegas, Nevada.)

       Check this one out (thank you, anonymous blogger)...      urlLink  http://www.cbmw.org/rbmw/rbmw.pdf       This is an electronic version of John Piper's book  Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood . Pay special attention to pp. 12-21, which is the foreword and speaks specifically about how singlehood does not glorify God any less than being married. Amen, brother!

       A friend sent the following article to me yesterday, which she copied from the Singles page on ChristianityToday.com.  ----------------  At Joshua Harris's New Attitude Conference for singles this past January, Dr. Al Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, said: "I'm going to speak of the sin I think besets this generation. It is the sin of delaying marriage as a lifestyle option among those who intend someday to get married, but they just haven't yet. This is a problem shared by men and women, but it's a problem primarily of men."  He cited many reasons he thinks this "failure to marry" is problematic, primarily the fact that there's now a big gap between sexual maturity and sexual fulfillment: "We've created this incredible span of time where sexual passion is ignited but there is no holy means for it to be fulfilled." For this reason, he encourages marriage at a young age: "If you're 17, 18, 19, 20, in your early 20s - what are you waiting for?"  He also spoke of the "holiness of marriage as the central crucible for adult-making" and of the ill of single women putting off wife- and motherhood to establish their careers. He urged the singles in attendance at that conference to make getting married their top priority. "What is the ultimate priority God has called us to?" Mohler asked. "In heaven, is the crucible of our saint-making going to have been through our jobs? I don't think so. The Scripture makes clear that it will be done largely through our marriages."  Joining this bandwagon, Dennis Rainey and Bob Lepine of FamilyLife Today, a national radio broadcast of Campus Crusade's FamilyLife ministry, aired the tape of Dr. Mohler's talk. Afterward, the hosts voiced their absolute agreement with Mohler's message. Rainey added a personal anecdote about how excited he was when his sons popped the question to their respective wives, "because I knew life was about to begin in earnest."  ---------  I would love to hear anyone's opinion on the above article. I read this yesterday morning and have been thinking about it ever since. But instead of composing a thoroughly exhaustive rant on the many (and there are  MANY ) problems I have with what these men said, I want to bring up something else that occurred to me this morning.  I am a predominantly conservative person - I'm pro-life, I'm against gay marriage, and I usually vote Republican (or, I will, that is, since I have just recently emerged from my 'disillusioned college student' phase of non-votership). But as soon as I admit all of that stuff, I'm usually compelled to make the next statement, "but I'm not a wacko nut job like the rest of them". Or something along those lines. Depending on what crazy stunt the Wacko Nut Jobs have pulled recently. Because even though I do sincerely believe abortion is murder, and one-man-one-woman marriage is Sacred in the truest and weightiest sense of the word, and Republicans most often support these values...I'm not ever going to stand outside an abortion clinic and throw gospel tracts at people or any such nonsense. Or spout inanities about marriage being the ultimate priority of life in Christ…just as an example.  I believe in fostering change the way Jesus did, simply put. And that was one heart at a time, on a relational level. In fact, the people Jesus spoke most strongly against were the puffed-up, self-righteous religious leaders of his day. He spoke against those who held their intellectual superiority over people's heads, and those who fought for the status quo just because it was the status quo - just because "this is the way it's always been". He was revolutionary in that day...and He'd be revolutionary today. Obviously. That doesn't surprise anyone. But when someone asked Him about the government of the day - which, by the way, was WAY more controlling and corrupt than ours ever aspired to be - all He said was, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's."  And just so we all know what kind of Caesar we're talking about here...the emperor Nero (who reigned very soon after Jesus' death) actually organized a parade through the streets of Rome to showcase his 15-year-old male lover. I wonder how Dr. Al Mohler would have reacted.  But...I digress. I do this often as you have probably already figured out. I'm just wondering if anyone else feels the frustration I'm feeling...? I am a conservative who is ashamed to be associated with the Religious Right. Should I make up another name to use besides "conservative" so I don't have to talk badly about others every time I’m asked of my beliefs? How do I deal with the ridicule and shaming I receive from my conservative friends when I admit that I visit salon.com and listen to NPR? And most importantly…any ideas concerning  positive  ways we can make a difference?

       My favorite apostle is John. If it's okay to have favorites among the founders of the Church, that is. Maybe it's his simple, poetic language.  "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."  Maybe it's his tendency to focus on just a few basic elements of our faith: loving God, loving others, and walking in the light. Or maybe it's the mental picture of this grown man resting his head on Jesus' chest during the Last Supper. Yep, that's it. That's the clincher. And what made him do that on that night? Could he sense somehow that he would shortly be separated from his Friend and Lord? Or did he just want to be near...to close his eyes and hear the sound of Jesus' heartbeat and smell the road dust on His clothes?  I can only speculate about his state of mind that night. We are not told. But what we are told over and over in John's gospel is that he was supremely aware of his own identity. But we'll get back to John in just a few minutes. I need to share a little background info as to why he became Rachel's Favorite Apostle.  The main thing that made adolescence such a horrific experience for me (and maybe for you too) was this one very small, very powerful word - change. The beginning of seventh grade heralded a new era in my life. Instead of one classroom, I suddenly had seven. Instead of a desk, a locker. And instead of participating in P.E. class in my school clothes, I was herded along with the other socially awkward 13-year-old girls into a locker room where we had to - what? Change clothes?! And all of this on the first day!  In addition to the changes being impressed upon me from the outside were the physical and emotional changes I experienced from the inside. Almost overnight, it was way too easy for me to develop a mild crush-bordering-on-maniacal-fixation for a boy, and even easier for the slightest rebuff from said boy to send me crying to my mother's arms declaring with miserable certainty that I would never love again like I loved him.  But I did eventually find some balance. The tumult and internal drama of my early adolescence gave way to the carefree attitude of my later adolescence. Wait…did I just hear my mom say care less  attitude? Just kidding, Mom. Maybe. But anyway, just when I was getting the hang of the high school gig, it was over. And I was packing for college. And then I was moving to college, into a dorm room with a girl I had just met. And...I wasn't even there a full day before I drove the  entire  two-hour trip home and informed my parents that I would  not  be going to such a terrible, obviously elitist college. Did I mention I have trouble with change?  Lucky for me, my parents made me drive back up to the school...and four (okay, four and a half) years later, I graduated from that same institution wiser and smarter and more confident than when I had entered. And it was sometime during those four (and a half) years that I chose my Favorite Apostle.  John wasn't bold like Peter. He wasn't industrious like Martha. And it seems like maybe he was just a little passive when we take into account the awkward discussion his mother had with Jesus about the seating chart in Heaven. But do you know what he thought of himself? Do you know what he had the audacity to call himself all throughout his gospel account? He actually referred to himself as "the disciple whom Jesus loved". I mean, as IF. It almost seems like John thought Jesus didn't compare him to anyone else. Almost like Jesus loved John no matter what - no matter how shy or careless or passive he was on any given day. What a strange idea!  What a strange idea, indeed. Strange, and beautiful. He was John, son of Zebedee, but he didn't want to be known by his earthly heritage. He knew that his identity came from something beyond his parents, children, achievements, failures, vocation, receding hairline, or sense of humor. He was at his very core Loved by Jesus. Lay him on the operating table, open him up, and I'm sure you will find on his heart a tattoo bearing the words "the Beloved".  This truth is what sustained John.  "How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are!" "Perfect love casts out fear." "God is love."  And it is what sustains me. I am moody, and smart, and impulsive, and funny, and primarily selfish.  But as long as I allow myself to be defined by either good or bad characteristics, I'm losing. I am at best missing the point, and at worst living my life as an emotionally wooden puppet of external influences. Because those things will CHANGE. Other people's opinions of me will change. My opinion of MYSELF will change. But my status as "the disciple whom Jesus loves" will never change.  And now we see what Jesus meant when he declared,  “The Truth will set you free.”  When I fully absorb this truth, I realize that life as Songwriter Rachel, or Dependable Rachel, or Funny Rachel – that none of these compare to life as Rachel the Beloved. They are either minor facets of life as the Beloved that we have pushed onto center stage, or they are Impostors of our real self and must be dealt with. It’s scary (and sometimes downright terrifying) to live according to this reality. For those of us who have spent our lives trying to fit in, or win praise, or be pleasing – this is a destructive Truth. But it only destroys what binds us.  So let us strive to live by this destructive, scary, and life-giving Truth. Let us strive to reject the lie of performance-oriented acceptance. Let’s work from the calm assurance that God loves us madly and, therefore, could never love us more than He does right now. Lay aside the mask, if only for ten minutes at first, and just take a deep breath. Try to relate to another person as the Beloved, rather than the Comedian or the Scholar or the Therapist. And try to see them as the Beloved as well, no matter what shiny distractions they throw up. Just try it once. I have a feeling you’ll get hooked.  One more thing. Is it any mystery that John was the one chosen to see a vision of the New Heaven and the New Earth and then share that vision with us? From this I am reminded that God's love for me is not without promise. What is even 100 years of pain when compared to an eternity with Him? I for one know that I'm going to spend at least the first 500 years resting my head against the chest of Jesus, my eyes closed, listening to His heartbeat, and smelling the sweet smell of Victory on His garments. And you'll just have to wait your turn.
