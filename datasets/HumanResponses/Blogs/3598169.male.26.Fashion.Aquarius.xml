      Okay,  So,  I'm wondering,  would anyone like to come up with a concept for an Artcar.  I have landed a pretty sweet deal on a mobile platform, which can be altered on Artnight.     Let your imagination run wild and post some comments on whether or not that this could be a worth-while expediture of time.

      Every now and then I find that I feel devoid of any inspiration to create.  It is a very different feeling than lacking belief in any skill set or inate ability to be creative or artist or groovey.  But every now and then I also experience an over abundance of inspiration whether it be a particular emotion like deep angst or a little life experience that I just can't shake.  I have to be grateful at this time as I am not able to shake one of those life experiences.  About 6 months ago I arrived at a friend's house after a eveing movie. I lost all interest in everything except two pre-teen girls jumping on a matress, giggling and trying ot out-crazy thie other.    The scene wasn't abnormal, except it was all taking place in a house with no mother present, a father in jail, and a very negative and rotund adult of unknown affiliation who was hawking out commands and profanities from the very far recesses of a worn out lazyboy that was completely vieled in a thick haze of cigarette smoke.  So, amidst the house full of filth, apathey and opression there were 2 10 year old girls full of joy, laughter and unwavering hope.  It is that moment and memory that I find inspiration to capture and recreate such an emotion of boundlessness that reaches to the ends of existence and is able to infect every corner of hurt, pain, despair that are as I feel the majority of the America we turn a blind eye upon.

      So, procurement of artists is now taking shape. I can vouch for at least an hour of superb value, just a little more to go.  Also, I need to shamelessly plug Will Canon's new Flick  Youngster.  We will all have the opportunity to see it at the Magnolia the end of June, and if you miss it, again at ARtNight.    Yes, a shameless plug for ArtNight, by Artnight.  Youngster will be shown.  Thank you Will, thank you Fox.
