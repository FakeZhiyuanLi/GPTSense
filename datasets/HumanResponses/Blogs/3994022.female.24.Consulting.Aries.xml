						    Dragon Boat Festival  Saturday I attended the  urlLink Dragon Boat Festival  at Sloans Lake in Denver. Not far from my home the event is Colorado's premiere showcase of pan-Asian culture, combined with a unique, thrilling athletic competition -- Dragon Boat Racing, an ancient sport that's catching on worldwide.  This is one of the boats used in the race.    Some children cooling off near the boats.    The Dragon!      Fixture of the Sloans Lake Neighborhood.    A perfect end to a great evening.

						    Fly Fishing on the Big Thompson  Friday I took a day of rest and headed up to Estes Park for some fly fishing. About an hour north of Denver on the outskirts of Rocky Mountain National Park is the Big Thompson River. It was sunny and cool at 7am and there was little to no activity on the surface. In the first hour I landed a Rainbow on a RS2 Nymph.    Next came this lovley Lake Trout, I think, on a RS2.    After 10am I switched to a Blue Winged Olive dry fly as there was some surface activity. I landed two Browns near the Dam in the next 2 hours. All in all it was a relaxing day.    A herd of Elk decided to cross the river several yards in front of me. All protected by this big buck.

						   I hiked the Herman Gulch trail on Sunday and did a little Fly Fishing. Herman Gulch is located in the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests near Idaho Springs. The trail is 5 miles roundtrip and starts at an elevation of 10,400ft and ends at 12,705ft at Herman Lake.    A nice sized pool, formed by a beaver damn was my first query and there were 10-15 small trout feeding on the surface. Here I landed a litte Greenback Cutthroat in a matter of seconds.   Several minutes later I landed this tiny Brooke Trout. Small but damn tough when death is on the line. Literaly.
