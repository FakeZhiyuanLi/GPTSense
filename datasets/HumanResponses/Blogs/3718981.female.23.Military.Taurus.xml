      Here is my latest issue to ponder over of sorts. This morning, after taking to weimaraner outside, I checked my cell. My ex (let's call him J)had texted me... To fill in the missing important information, J and I were together for a long time and, needless to say, broke up after him sleeping with a stripper and sucking ever last penny he could from me with the idol promise of "I'll pay you back next paycheck". It never happened. We broke up and had one of the worst possible one in my history, and he's got a new girlfriend who is, get this, a stripper in Maryland.  ...Anyways, he wants her to go with him to Buffalo to see his family in July (isn't it great how I'm going to Boston the same two weeks he'll be in New York) and can't pay for it. So instead of even calling me to ask, he just texts me, "Hey you wanna wire me some loot?" No 'please' or anything.  First off, the balls of this 25 year old. Second, couldn't he even be decent enough to call me and ask? Third, like I would help him out in any single way unless he was dying? The nerve... Besides, hello! I'm MARRIED. Why won't he go away?  Not like I'm going through my own issue or anything...  My actual big issue this past few days is discovering my handsome man is addicted to prescription pain killers. I had to force it out of him. So what did I do? The only thing I could think of: Give all the pills to the toilet and give him an ultimatum. If he does it again behind my back then I'll leave him. I can't love this man as much as I do and let him not only destroy himself, but our relationship all because he wants to feel 'numb'. That was one of the reasons J was such a bastard and still is...  So besides that I haven't a clue what else I should do. It's been 4 days counting today that the handsome husband has been clean, and already the improvement on his soul is like night and day.

      Thanks to my recent mood (see previous entry) today, I wanted to add the phrase:   FUCK IRAQ   Those dumb bastards cut people's HEADS OFF.   We should just blow them up.   (I can feel this way for many reasons- the main one being my lov-vah's in the military...)

      Coffee. Need more coffee.   Venti please.  Skim milk.   (What the fuck?) Make that extra skim milk.   One sugar. I don't fucking care what kind. Surprise me.       I swear the Starbucks chain, which is normally amazing, has decided to turn into a crappy version of Dunkin' Donuts in Arizona. See, back in Boston, you go into Dunkin's and some bitchy little hag gives you a coffee. Atleast she lets me off the ten thousand questions trip. Boston Starbucks? They let you make your own milk/sugar combination. Even in New York. What the hell is with these people out here? Can't they see that there are people who are the farthest thing from social before they get atleast three cups in their system?   Now that   that   is out of my system...    I need a cigarette. Yet another addiction. Was planning on quitting, but then moved here, and for some reason I have to be on a diet. I'm not fat, just feel fat. Yes, there is a difference. Females all know the perils of the 'feel fat' epidemic that runs rampant through our blood. Besides, it's bad enough I'm anti-sun tanning living in the capital of skin cancer, but I'm going home in a month for a few weeks (husband coming still up in the air) and have this sick erge to look better than all my friends and sister times a trillion. Part of the whole, "Fabulous" thing... besides, I've got real Manolo's. Just the icing on the cake. Going home is going to be interesting. I'm the only one who got married. So far anyways. The girls all bitch because they want more than just having sex with some random guy, and ain't it funny how married women just want to have sex with one random guy? I think it's the whole 'forbidden' thing that makes it so alluring. What is the whole morphing thing women go through between single and married anyway? Are we truly expected to settle down, stay at home, make dinner that is more substantial but less comforting than Hagen Daas? Where we have to just look at those Manolos and Jimmy Choos instead of taking them home because we have 'responsibility' that is greater than showing off our sexy pedicured toes?  *inhale* {breathe deep} *exhale*  Fuck the diet today. I think I just need a makeover or something. Where is my Kevin Aucoin book? I need another Marlboro Light...

      This is what happened last Saturday night in Boston... my friend Kristoffer was at a bar not even 15 minutes before he attemped to do a split. I guess it only shows you that guys should never wear jeans that tight- or attempt to be flexible... *wink*&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      For someone who usually never dreams, this morning I woke up horribly upset.  I remember the alarm going off at the unreasonable hour of 5.30 am, my husband Mark getting up to get ready for work, and then the dog moving into his warm spot on the bed. He kissed me goodbye, and mumbled "I'm gonna be late if I don't hurry" or something along those lines. I fell back into sleep, and then that's when it happened. Dreams are so lovely and always seem to be dreams when they occur, but nightmares take on a totally different light. They seem actual,without any of the cloudy haze that appears when it's pleasant.  Thanks to my own vivid imagination, my day is shot. It's the afternoon and I'm still jittery. This never happens to me. For some reason I don't feel well rested, and I did sleep a very adequate amount of time.   I think I need a nap...

      I suppose I should just start this interesting endeavor off with some glorious quote. Fuck it. I'm all set with setting the standards too high at first.  Have you ever just woke up and wondered how your life turned up the way it has? Or how the world doesn't seem so wonderous as it used to even 10 years ago? Granted, I was 13 then, but still. There was shit to do. Things to amuse yourself with. For some reason, I was up at 5.30 this morning contemplating life and love, and if it was all a reality or just a state of mind...  When was that last time I got out of bed at 5.30?
