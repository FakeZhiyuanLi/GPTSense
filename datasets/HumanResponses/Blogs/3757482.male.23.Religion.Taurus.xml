      Well, I am back, and well...God is still as amazing as ever.  He never ceases to amaze me.  Here is why.  First, He has begun to move me in the direction He wants me to go at this time.  Meaning, I am going to be attending the driving class for FedEx Ground starting July 6.  What an answer to prayer, not only that, but as long as I pass the class, I have a full time driving job lined up with a route that I used to load, so I am already familiar with the stops!  Praise God!  Also, this means that I will most likely not be able to do any work for the music group "Rescue."  At least that I know of.  I am ok with that, because I know I am at least part of their minsitry through prayer and promotion (Want them to sing at your church or event?  Email me!).  Also, I believe that this will open the door for me to minister in the music department at my church...Maranatha Baptist.  None of these are 100% sure, but are a 98% chance of happening, but God is a mover and a shaker, so I will go where He leads.  He also suprised me with humbling me in a lot of areas.  I prayed the other day that God would humble me in the areas that I needed to be humbled in, and me being as humble as I am, didnt think there was any area that I really needed work in... and ... BOOM!  I found out that I did have some pride issues, or at least areas where I needed to work on how I carry myself and communicate with others, to let them know that I am the same.  He brought a couple people to me to show areas where my pride had clouded my judgement and where the changes in my life were not communicated properly.  I thank God for humbling me, and though it hurts a little, I pray that I am continually humbled for the purpose of serving Him more closely.  When we pray...He answers, and is faithful to always and ever change our hearts, if we are willing.    Lastly, I would like to share about a commitment that I made this last Sunday.  It took almost 16 years of my life as a Christian to come to this point.  So, often as Christians we talk about taking up our cross and following God with all we have, but that is just it, we only talk and we hardly do.  This last Sunday I committed to giving whatever it took to follow Christ.  That I would leave behind the things that distracted me from Him and that I would use the things left for His honor and glory.  Really, this is a scary commitment, and not to be taken lightly.  I am in the process of learning what needs to be given up and what needs to be used.  I would like to share a verse that helped encourage me with this decision...  Isaiah 1-16-20 Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; Put away the evil of your doings from before My eyes. Cease to do evil, Learn to do good; Seek justice, Rebuke the oppressor;[1] Defend the fatherless, Plead for the widow. "Come now, and let us reason together," Says the LORD, "Though your sins are like scarlet, They shall be as white as snow; Though they are red like crimson, They shall be as wool. If you are willing and obedient, You shall eat the good of the land; But if you refuse and rebel, You shall be devoured by the sword"; For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.  "If you are willing and obedient"...that is my commitment...now to see where the Lord leads me!  Thanks to those who encourage and pray!  Til next time...  -Scott

          ok, so i am attempting this blogging thing again.  i tried it once back in november, but never did anything else with it.  anyways.  as the title says, opportunities, is definitely what the Lord has brought my way.  its pretty crazy that the few things that i never would have expected to come my way...have.  not to mention the blessing of having a close friend be there when one of the opportunities was brought to my attention.  God is so good.     a few months ago, i was so caught up in myself and "waiting" for God to do something, that i began to wonder if He was ever going to do anything with me.  i was ready to leave my church, search for a new job...and other sorts.  in short, i was ready to try to do it on my own, and began to try.  i cant think of any "one thing" that helped with the 180 turn, but i know some key factors, were my parents, friends, a college retreat, and select co-workers of mine.  God used these outlets to encourage me to get back on track and when i am content with where the Lord had me, and i do not only sit and "wait," but work and "wait," that then it might be then that i see the hand of God begin to move things in my life.  and so He did.  God worked at my heart, humbling me, renewing me, and restoring me to the point of being content with where He placed me.     not long after i began working on my relationship and contentness with God, i began to see Him working.  first it was an opportunity in music ministry with my church Maranatha Baptist.  at the time, i was taken back, but unsure of the opportunity.     not long after, He began to open up a door at work to really stand my ground and stand up for Him, and when i took the opportunity to do that, i saw Him open up a door for possible advancement at FedEx Ground.  i prayed about these opportunities, first thanking God for bringing them my way, then asking Him for guidance.  i will get back to those in a little bit.     then God's hands began moving again.  this time in an area that is so close to my heart that i stood back and was amazed and priveledged and humble by this possible opportunity.  my good friend Katie and i attended a church to hear a favorite group of mine, named Rescue, do special music.  not long after the concert, i was approached by one of the guys and was asked if i would consider and pray about being part of their "behind the scenes" ministry.  what a dream come true, but wow.  i held my composure, but i was doing flips inside and overwhelmed with emotions.     these three opportunities have not yet been solidified yet, but they are heavy on my heart.  all of them are great opportunities with plenty of ministry opportunities also.  i am praying that God would put a neon sign over the direction(s) He would have me to go, and close and lock the doors that are not to be entered at this time.  i know that i am not able to make this decision on my own, and only from the wisdom of God and the Godly counsel He brings my way will I be able to discern the best opportunity for me to take part in.  i would appreciate and covet your prayers concerning these matters.     God has blessed me beyond what i could have ever asked for, yet knowing i still have so far to go in many areas pertaining to my walk with God, finances, relationships and the disciplines of a Godly man.  as a country singer once said, "i'm a work in progress."  i hope to never stop progressing.  we are not perfect, but we are called to chase perfection, to seek after it.  yet, to seek it not by ourselves, but rather with God, letting Him direct our paths.  God is good, and may i never forget that and continually be humbled by His work in my life.  -Scott

      Wow, has a lot happened since last time I wrote in this journal.  Well, here you go...here is the update!  First, Katie's mother (Carolyn) and sister (Rachel) came out for a wedding around the 4th and I had the priviledge to spend some time with the both of them and other family of Katie's.  We went down to some waterfalls, up to Mt. Hood and later in the week to Mt. St. Helens.  It was a time much enjoyed.  It was good to spend time with them and get to see them on territory that I am familiar with.  That was not the best part for me.  The best part came after they left, actually it was just a couple days ago, when I received a letter from Carolyn.  She was so nice and most of encouraging to me in following the will of God and listening for His voice, so that I may follow Him with sure steps.  Not her exact words, but so very encouraging.  It is always awesome to know that people are praying for you that you dont even know about, then one day you come across it and find out, and...well, its humbling, isnt it?  Second, I had the awesome opportunity to travel with the group Rescue to a concert in Eugene.  A 2 day trip with these guys.  Let me tell you, these guys are so awesome, cause 1)they love the Lord, 2)they actually care about the people around them, whether they are ministering to them, working with them or living with them.  3)they are hilarious and total goofs when there is down time.  I had so much fun and learned a lot about what they do, how they do it, and why they do it.  God answered a simple dream with this weekend, and there are possibilities for more in the future!  Third, I am 2 days away from being a FedEx Ground driver.  Tomorrow is the big FINAL, but I already have my uniform...weird, eh?  Yes, my friends, I am almost there and I am still alive, more importantly the people on the road are still alive.  HA HA.  Its definitely had its up and downs, but God is good and has helped me through the tough or annoying parts.  He is still faithful to continue to work with me and stand by when I am ready to give up.  Also, the details of the route that I will be driving are just about set-up, just have to talk with a CPA about some business finances, and off I go.  God is so good.  He has brought me more than I have asked for and even blessed me beyond what I could ever deserve.  Lately, I have been thinking about what it is that keeps me from talking to Him more, that causes me to start walking closer to the fence line or even on the fence, even worse, falling off on the wrong side.  What causes that?  Why would I get close after knowing all He has, is, and will be doing in my life?  Doesnt add up.  Frankly, we often think we can start doing it on our own.  We begin to think we got ourselves to where we are at.  We lose sight of the ministries in front of our face.  It usually starts in one place for me.  First my heart.  I should purpose in my heart to read God's word as a priority in my day.  Second, when I read His word, to not throw it by the way side, but to plant it firmly in the depths of my heart to give it a strong foundation when it begins to grow.  Third, to feed what I have planted in my heart, I must learn out to act upon the principles that are being learned.  Put them into practice.  Let them grow and become a characteristic of who I am, but more importantly, who God wants me to be.  Then that is when I begin to grow, that is when I begin to walk further away from the fence, then is when my ministry comes from an overflow of what God is doing in my life.  Yet always knowing that I have not obtained perfection, but rather, I continue to press on toward the goal.  One of my greatest prayers is that I never let go of where I am at, but that I press on.  I also pray that you would press on.  Together we can accopmlish so much for God!  -Scott
