           Man my night sucked! I kept getting put into a bad mood all night! By guess who... Pablo! Go figure! At least it wasn't Kyle this time! I hate him! I have nothing to do with him anymore! YAY for me! All me and Pablo did though today was fight and it was mostly about stupid shit! Oh well it's over with but I'm still in a bad mood!     Brother comes home tomorrow night I'm seriously thinkin about going down to Jeffersonville for a week! I need to clear my head! I want to go stay with my father this weekend though! I am starting to miss my dad and step-mom! My life is all about my friends and drugs! I need to get away from them for a week or so! I really do! I miss my baby brother most of all! My big brother to! I never knew life would be so different after my big brother thats been around all my life moved away after high school! I'm so proud of him yet I miss him so much and want him to come home! It's different not having him around!    I think Meagan is mad at me b/cuz I haven't went into town in almost a week b/cuz of Kyle and Jen going out! I was so stupid to fall for him again! Once again he broke my heart! All the signs were there! I mean he wouldn't talk to me, all the guys kept askin me if I was going to beat the shit out of her, and she always thought I hated her! Well Jen if you read this... no, I don't hate you.. I hate you for being with Kyle! But one the other hand Meagan I am sorry for not coming into town! You understand how I feel right now! We've both had our share of asshole's well you only Josh! lol But I am sorry! I still love you my bestest buddy! Rainbow Power! Hahaha I love you!     Well I'm going to go to sleep now tomorrow is another day! More people to piss off, more reefer to smoke,more booze to drink!

            I had an awsome fucking night, and a hang over from hell! I got so drunk last night for the first time since Josh's graduation and I hardly even drank then. It was so much fun Pablo kept yellin at me b/cuz I didn't feel good. My world was spinnin bad! Me and Crystal talk for like ever b/cuz her and Pablo kept fightin and I told her to leave him alone! He kept fuckin with me all night. He made me give him a piggyback ride when I was drunk it was fun. Then he was going to beat the shit out of this guy it was awsome!        I talked to Meagan last night.So did alot of other people that were there with me! But I talked to her I think she was mad at me but if she is I'm sorry Meagan!      Brother comes home soon... I don't know what day it is but I know he comes home soon!      Well I'm going to go! Things to do, people to see, and weed to smoke! hahaha

       Well... I figured I would give one of these things a try. This is my first blog of many prolly! Got really fucked up last night with Pab,Jackass,Joe Dirt, and Sally! Other than that I did nothing exciting! Meagan and I got into a fight yesterday b/cuz I won't go into town b/cuz of Kyle... He is such an asshole! He can rot in hell. I haven't been in town for like 3-4 days! I can't go there b/cuz if I do I will just want to beat the shit out of Kyle and his lil girfriend Jen! Yes I DO HATE her! Pablo is staying in town he is moving in with Joe Dirt at Country View! YAY! I am so happy! I would have missed him so much if he would of moved to Indy for good! That would have sucked big time! The good news is that Crystal isn't moving in with them so hahahaha! Mama hates her so she wouldn't let them live together! Ha ha! She told me I could but not until I get out of school! YAY! My day is already starting off great just got high! Hehehe! I am the greatest! Oh yeah! That's all I do anymore get high and talk online! I am just the best! Well I must be running I still have to take a shower and get ready for the day ahead of me! It's going to be a dousy! hahahaha My wonderful life!

      Today was so hot! I hate the summer time! But then again I love it! It's only Tuesday and I miss home more than every! I talked to my mommy today! I miss her! I never really get to see her when I am at home either b/cuz she works during the day and I usually go out at night so I never spend time with her! When I go back home that is one thing i need to do! I miss her so much and she lives in the same house and everything! Sorry don't mean to be all mushy about my mom! Meagan and I talked today! I feel bad cause I'm not home when she's going to a bad time with everyone up there! Like Kyle and Danielle! But she won't have to worry about Danielle b/cuz I found out that the day Meagan had Macy Danielle was smokin a cig. I'm sorry but her own parents don't smoke in front of her b/cuz she has breathing problems, so what makes Danielle so fuckin special? Nothing! I don't give a fuck who she is Meagan asked her not to smoke while Macy was around and she didn't give a shit and did it anyways! That pisses me off Macy isn't even 1 yet! She can't get up and walk out! She is a baby and Danielle is suppose to be an ADULT! Oviously not considering she has friends not even her own age! She is a child molester! She can pull an RKelly on ur ass in a heartbeat just ask some of the 17 year olds she's slept with! See now I'm pissed! See this whole coming down here to clear my head is a good thing unless your someone that I don't like! But I am going to go for now!

      I'm in Jeffersonville! Visiting Brother for a week! I need a break from everyone! EXSPECIALLY the rents cause being noisy like always read my blog! Now come on I understand it's out there in the open but who really goes through the compo to check what your 16 year old daughter is doing online! Well they went to my blog and red it and of coarse found out everything! Mom thought I was trying to keep myself clean! I am... when school starts I can't do anything cause I will be driving! 21 more days until I get my license! But yeah that wasn't really something that I wanted to find out before I left that even online I can't keep things from them! I would tell them more shit but I think they blow it way out of proportion! Saw Kyle before I left yesterday! Good thing he needed Josh to buy him smokes or Meagan wouldn't of gotten to see me before I left! Plus I wouldn't of gotten to see my kid... I love her! Justin's birthday is tomorrow! Happy 21st Jay! I love u! Hope u have a good birthday! It's early back home it's only 10 here and 9 back home! It sucks being an hour ahead! Everything is going to be wierd this week! I don't know how I'm getting home but I will get back! School starts the 17th yeah I am going to get drunk with Pablo the night before cause I'm the only one going back to school! Yay for me! Well I must be running I don't know what else to write about to more later! See ya later fuckers!
