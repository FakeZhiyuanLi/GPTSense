      Missed school today...probably not the smartest since it's the last day of this semester, but oh well...it's not like I can go back and change the past, thought soo many times I wish I could. Not gonna dewl on the fact Kat is leaving...it's not bad or anything, just sorta sad and fustrating ^_^ she didn't tell me she was going, i had to ask...at least she'll be happy... depressed and not really in the mood to talk or write...miss B amazingly, so much it's starting to scare me...i wonder what's going on with him...

      La la la...sitting in CAD/CAM right now :P supposed to be doing a project but don't really feel like it.  Anyway, I have some pages I wanted to post in here...from before because it wasn't letting me get this blog :P  January 1st-27th Relationship wise, I want someone I care for to be with me like Kat and Mylo.  I thought B would be that person, but I made a mistake by ranting off about things with Kat.  B always seems to be playing CS whenever I'd want to talk to him, and I don't ahve the heart to make him stop playing the game he loves soo much.  I want to put my mom's, dad's, sister's, Kat's, and B's happiness before mine.  Why should I be happy when no one else is?  I feel like I shouldn't, so taht's the way I treat it. I want people to understand my feelings...I want to be around someone who always know's what I'm thinking so i don't always have to explain myself.  I don't explain my feelings to others, becaseu I'm afradi of the reaction I would get to what I say...but I've learned, slowly, that I need to talk about how I feel or it ends up making everything worse then it already is.  Why do i do that?  Why can't I just express my feelings? I like the idea of this...my consence is in my stomache :P thank you kat for pointing that out....yes, it's sounds weird, but so far it's been true.  It's a really fun way to find out what I'm really feeling. Damn.....my thoughts just keep coming back to B.  There was an interesting fight yesterday...Kat went to bat for me because I didn't feel like coming out and saying everything I wanted to.  She didn't really twist what I said to her, but took the meanings differently then what I thought I put them out as.  So she went out on B and now they hate eachother, putting me in the middle.  Yes, I can make a choice and not have one of them in my life, but I want them BOTH there.  B is the caring guy I thought I would bever hace or see agian, and now he wants to just be friends...and kat is the closest person I have at this tie in my life.  They're both very important to me and I don't want to make that choice.  I know where I want to go with B...I want to be his gf...I don't want to foget what happened..I want to keep going, but add in things we should've done first, like know eachother.  To me, I could work around it and get everything to work out, but I'd have to do it myself. Withough myself knowing it, I let my heart get tossed freely into a relationship.  It just happened...I don't know if it's love..I wouldn't know since what I thought it was ended badly.  I never thought I would give myself to someone again, after jake...Jake who had brought me new experiences..then broke my heart cause he didn't think he could handle a long distance relationship.  I don't hate him, like my firends do, but I don't...do I still care for him? Probably not since I haven't seen him for 4 yrs.  I thought I was done with it..I was hoping I could get to college before falling again..but B popped into my life....still yummy though. When I'm with B, I'm happy.  Kat think's I[m pure..B probably does too, but I"ve locked a night on a tramp away in the back of my mind..that was something of a mistake..something I"ll never forget..but keep locked up for as long as I can.  Dare I tell him all that I've felt, think, and know? Yes...I should.  It's something I know I need to do.  I emailed him...I'm afraid he'l turn away form what I wrote..I wanted him to know where I stand and how I feel, but when I reread it after I sent it, it sounded like I was pleading for something.  Maybe it was the way I read it or even how I felt at the time.  I'm not confused, or well, not as much as i was before.  Now?  Now I feel..crushed and denied my heart's desire...yeah..I can live with or without B...I can forget what happened and move on...but I'll have felt like I missed something in my life.  Yay!  plaing a LAN for Jan 24-25 :) B is hopefully coming down!  Sooo happyl, but I still need to convince my mom..but I"m sure I can do taht.  Anyway..B and I fixed our relationship :P we're not forgeting what happened but working off of it...Like getting to know eachother better.  LOL Friends with bennifits! Conley got asked out by Dane...FINALLY!! Geez, took him long enough :) but hey, it's soo cool and a really happy atmosphere. 0.o found out mylo is REALLY serious about Kat.  It's cool to know it, but I'm wondering how it'll work out.  It's sweet people can just click like that.  I'm happy for them both and really hope it works out between them. :D So..here I am, in a second class of Math :P listening to Kat'sl iPod (redhot, under the bridge)  It's fun not going to CAM..not that I would've been doing anything different in the first place.  But, hey, oh well :) test today...yuck :P  ---------------Breath Break :P Can't Believe How Much I've Written These Last Couple Of Days :) Okay, Done :D Back To Finishing Entering These---------------  Ok...I don't know if it's a good thing, but B is coming down this weekend...I thought I'd be more excited about it..maybe it just hasn't registeredyet. Kat is wanting to do a Double Date..her and mylo, me and B.  I think it would be cool to do, but I got to get B out and do it.  I think we might end up doing lunch and moive, or dinner and movie...we'll see. Finished taking my math test.  It was unexcting.  I thought it was going to be really hard, but I just went thorught it reallly fast. :P Either I knew what I was doing or I learned nothing and just wrote stuff down...I'm hoping it's the first. Anyway, dad has really stressed to LaDonna that he just wants to be freidns for now.  I feel bad about that because I really like her...then it give me the chanve with B... ...shoudln't think about him.  HOme is alreayd depressed..with mom telling me I need to change and spend more time with her...I found it easier to be aorund her when my parents were together, and now I hate spending time with ehr...just the opposite with my dad..How did that happen?  Maybe because i've gottent he chanve to one on one with noth of them, and found out things I liked and didn't like.  La la la....in CAM like usual.  Nothing is really going on.  Tomorrow I'll ahve to finish the rest of my drwings and turn them in.  Oh well.  Most of the time we screw off and have fun.  I do enjou what i've learned thought. :) it's fun. So, Brad was supposed to come down last weekend, but LaD, said no less then 24 hrs before my dad was supposed to pick him up..I want to know why.  She says it's because of money issues...BS!!  It could also be ebcause my dad broke it off with her... ...I dunno.  I'ts something thought.  Hopefully, or well I'm gonna try to get Brad up here this weekend, but only if he wants to. God..I played CS ALL WEEKEND!! instead of doing my hw like I was supposed to...smart move...I met some cool guys, and now I'm consent on one server with them...it's great cause I'm one of the 9 girls that play there, and I'm the youngest one (not all of them know that though :D)  I tried getting Tanya to dl Steam 1.6 for her CS files, but she kept shutting it down so it hasn't finished yet...I'm going to try to get mom to do it while we are at lessons today. Wow...my thoughts are back at Brad...I really need to stop thinking about him.  Where do I want to go with him?  I want him to he as happy as he can be, so I'm not going to push anything, even though I want to.    everything is soo confusing right now.  Not hard, just can't really make sense of my feelings and what I want...Oh well...it'll take time, but I'll work through it.  ---------------Right, I'm done now :P there's more, but it's all repetitive, so I'm not going to type it :D my hands hurt.---------------

      Ok. So nothing is really going on atm. Life's just kinda blah :P but at least it's going somewhere.  It's the last week of this semester....yay for final in math... and then, Kat's going to Summit next semi, so she's not going to be here...it'll be interesting. ack...so stressed over tests and not knowing where everything is going with people around me. Why do i feel so left out in the dark...?  So...there's this one guy on my mind...Brad... I really haven't known him very long, and I know very little about him. I want the chance to know more....but we haven't been talking like we used to...why? I hope something hasn't happened since the last time i saw him. I want the chacne to at least be his friend, or one of them, maybe be more if he gives me that chance...but how would I tell him how I feel. yeah, i could just come out and say it, but that's not who I am. i would keep everything inside, all emotions, unless they bursted out unwillingly. God!! how I wish I could tell people how I feel....like earlier today, Kat and Conley didn't want to do their english sim because they didn't know what to say about the topics they could talk about, and instead of just trying to give it a shot, they gave up and said they wouldn't do it. sure, you have 2 more years to do it, but what if you don't pass???? At least this time you know and your prepared for the next time you have to take it. oh well...their loss. then they were talking about their childern...that I couldn't handle, and I think, or I hope, they knew that. It just didn't seem right what they were saying...really really uncomfortable.  So other then that, life is pretty good. I can't seem to get along with my mom though...dunno why...and i'd rather be living with my dad, which is weird considering i hated him when my parents were together, but now that they are apart, it's switched...we'll see where it goes. I've been pulling away from my sister, and I feel really bad about that, but I don't know how to make it up to her because she hasn't given me the chance to. And Kat...with her going to Summit, I've felt like she's been putting more and more distance between us and our friendship........not that it hasn't happened before, but we've always been able to see eachother durring school hours... It's all just soo confusing...I don't know what to say...  my goal, for this, is to try to upgrade it when i get the chance, but that'll work when I've got soemthign to talk about :)

      wow....went back to school for the first time in like...6 or 7 days... :( I dunno what's wrong with me, but I get soo sick so easily, and then I don't want to go back to school cause of all the work I've missed...hmph...I need to work on that, but I don't know how.  YAY!! omg...our big lan is SOOO FREAKIN close!! next weekend, the 28th...ooo...i'm soo excited :) Zak made me treasurer, so I made a checking account for W007 Lan, but it's under my name till I turn 18, which is less then 1.5 yrs away :D. Brad is coming down too...I still dunno how I feel about it...I mean like, I want to see him, but I don't know how to act around him anymore...we grew apart and yeah...guess I can just see how it goes.  Soo bored..even though I'm happy, I can't really find anything to do. I've been playin CS alot, and got into a clan (cbk.Maggna :P) we have alot of fun :D got DC finally, so that's cool and been playin on the same server, so I'm now like rank 30 out of 4002 or something!! Happy about that, cause I love playin CS...so yeah...I'm gonna see if I can get a movie, probably a disney one since I feel like it.

      wow, haven't been here for awhile, guess that's because my hd fried... >  Schools back in order, which I'm happy about. Got a new CS clan (EN - Endless Nights) they are alot of fun, Dave is almost like a second father lol. We've been doing more scrims and are enter cal-O sometime this month :) it'll be cool to see where this goes, though I'm going to have to find a way to convince my dad that I have to play....that'll be tough seeing as he still is restricting me from the computer occasionaly. There's alot to work on, but it'll all get done in time.  Planing to go see Ally over the 4th of July, that'll be fun :D then Jordan and Anton want me to stop by them in Chicago...yeah right lol...that's a little far away, but we'll see. Might be cool to go site seeing for once. So yeah, that's all I really have time for, gotta finish a movie :)

      Yay for 3 posts in one day...too bad I can't write all this in one post :P would've been alot easier.  Well...dug a hole...probably almost all the way to China by now.  I don't want to hurt anyone...physically or emotionally on purpose.  Srry if it happens on accident.  I don't want to hear the lies, I don't want to be shielded from the truth.  I don't want this pile of problems...but I don't want a clean slate.  She needs to know something is going to happen.  He needs to figure out what it is.  They need to decide where THEY want to go, before I can get involved.  I'm not going to share secrets, but I might just be the one to push them together and talk.  I don't want to be in the middle...that where I deffinitly don't need to be, but I don't want to be completely on the sidelines.  That's what I need to do.  I need to figure out what I want and where I want to be.  Do I want a relationship...fling...friendship?  I don't know...honestly to god I wish I didn't have so many issues with myself and with others.

      I can't be with you.  Why?  Because when I remember how she looked at you, trusted you, and loved you, and I cannot take that from her.  I cannot be with you because I could never take her happiness...I could never tresspass on what she held so dear.  I want to be with you, I really do, but not when she still cares and loves.

      Do I have the heart to take what she loves most?  No...I couldn't do it, so why would I want to.  She could use and need him more than I could and do...but why?  She loves him...me...no, I think it would be too early to tell if my feelings were that deep.   I finished a commitment..woot!...but I'm bummed out.  Too much thinking for one day to be able to make any sense of it.  I hurt her...and I want to fix it, but there's no way that I'd be able to.  Nothing seems to be what you see.  Nothing is ever the way you want it to be, so deal with it.  rambling....so much fun >.

So, thought I would get together with Myles again today...but ended up making it a group thing...sorta...  Kat and I decided some things need to be said, so we went to a movie and talked with Myles...wasn't very productive other then me learning somethings.  Yeah...I would've really rather spent all that time with us him...but oh well >.

      wow...so early, or late, depending on how you look at it...  had an interesting day...Woke up and remembered I was supposed to bring Tanya her lunch >. . .  I don't handle relationships well >.  Yay for problems.  I'm over at my mom's, when I'm supposed to be at my dad's, which has created a lot of family stress.  Moved to my mom's for the week my dad was away on business, and here I solved a lot of issues I was having, and decided that it would be better for me if I was just able to stay here...yeah...brought that up with dad and wow.  He never gets anything.  He's always looking at things his way, that or he doesn't register what other people are trying to say and takes them one way without asking what they really ment.  I can't handle it.  I've put up with it for so long, I'm sick of it.  Yes, I said I would rather live with my dad, and guess what, at the time he was spoiling me silly and I was taking advantage of it.  Woohoo!!  Got a car and a new computer (which currently sucks) out of it, which is pretty cool considering.  Anyway, he's pissed and keeps saying I'm running away from him (and when he's like this it's probably true, but any child would) and that I'm abusing the situation >.  Kat...yeah...that's an interesting problem.  We get along, sometimes >. . .  I think I'm muttering nonsense now >.

      wow, how long has it been?&nbsp; guess quiet awhile cause a lot has happened, suprisingly.&nbsp; Started working with my mom on this new housing thing she has going.&nbsp; I'd explain it, but its beyond my reach of explain.&nbsp; Between working for her and trying to spend time with my sister, I've done little else...well...add CS into that too I guess.&nbsp; Time for everything almost.  Myles is still in Ashland with his dad and his brother...can't wait till he comes back :P only 2 more weeks...almost less then that I think now.&nbsp; Maybe another trip to seattle...which would be fun to see seattle this time :)  I don't know why I decided to post...it's 2:40 in the morning...maybe that's why.&nbsp; Can't sleep, too much on my mind.&nbsp; The good and bad of life.&nbsp; I've dealt with so much of it, I noticed I blocked a lot out of my life lately, like friends.&nbsp; No one has any idea on how much I miss having and spending time with those people you get along with really well.&nbsp; I think I play a lot of CS because of that.&nbsp; Yeah, I get along well with most people that I play with, and I love playing with my EN famliy, but I'm starting to miss the social interaction.&nbsp; I had a lot of fun with them all when we had the lan in Seattle, but that's gone, so I'm not seeing them 3 days in a row now.  I love rambling in the mornings when I don't really make any sense to myself.&nbsp; It's so helpful to get everything else out, even if I don't know what I'm saying exactly.&nbsp; Like the topic of Mr. Ben John Groeneveld.&nbsp; Yeah, that's my dad, mr asshole.&nbsp; we used to get along when he was spoiling me, but then things got out of hand.&nbsp; I don't know what caused the break, but I know what led up to it.&nbsp; Dropping out of school...very slowly...it was one class at a time type of thing, then there was the car accident, then the house sitting...lets see, the last one must've been when I spent the week at mom's cause he was away on buisness.&nbsp; Wow, that's a lot.&nbsp; Too bad I don't feel like going over it all.  Sometimes I wonder if I sound very very sad (srry, big words aren't working right now).&nbsp; All in self-pity and not really taking things in...repeating everything, making stuff look harder and seem worse than it really is.&nbsp; probably another one of my bad habits.&nbsp; Oh well, right now I can't think of a way to deal with it, other then to maybe keep writing here?&nbsp; I guess cause then I won't be ranting to people and this way I can look back over the shit I say.  What I need to work on is what I want to get done.&nbsp; High School, College, Pitter-Patter Business's, and whatever else comes my way.&nbsp; New car, new computer, my own house...big dreams but I've got the time to get it all done.  For the oddest of reasons I'm really missing Kathleen, Jason, Dave, Jaton and those guys (too many to list at this time of day for me).&nbsp; Yeah, they are a lot older than me, but I fit in ;) there were never and really odd moments.&nbsp; It was comfortable, and I miss that.&nbsp; ok   time for bed I guess...lets see if sleep comes tonight.
