           I just had a thought......          Reality is fake, I woke up last night thinking I was stuck in a dream, that everything was around me like a really dense cloud, I could fumble about, but nothing could be found.        But that's how it is in life, isn't it? When everything's clouded and you don't know where you're going, a light comes along and clears the clouds away. Either that or it rains, and while the rain may seem dreary for a while, you know that it leads to something clear and awesome after it's done.       I enjoy this journal, it lets me put my thoughts and my feelings down, whereas if I say what I want to say, it never comes out in the way it can go down if I am writing. I feel some kind of a lure to writing, it's provoking me to put a deeper thought, a deeper feeling down on the paper(or screen). I'm thankful to this site for allowing us to have this opportunity for free because this writing is a hell-of-a-lot better than my handwriting.        Lately I've been viewing sleep as an obstacle now, whereas I viewed it as an escape before. I don't want to go to sleep. Last night I didn't want to get in the car, but I did and I hated it. I want to continue what we had last night Mollie, I don't think it is anything more than a teenage relationship, but I figure what's life without little of that? I hope it can continue, and, one more thing, I'm paying next time again! :)        I guess all things do really work out for good. I was mad last November when my parents wouldn't let me take drivers ed, but all these months later I realize that if i hadn't of taken drivers ed last week, would this have happened? All I'm saying that is sometimes we look at the little things in life that are bad, when really everything else is good. We need to focus on the good, while taking care of the bad, because in doing so I believe that we all can be better people.        Now on the other side of things.........you're all dumb :)

      all i know is all i need and all i show is what i bleed i need a cover to prove what i will want to remove all that i've been through  is all that is not true.  Make the pain pure just wash it away it's been your best lure now end it today make it stop here you're causing pain still what i fear when will it wane.........  that is the result of 30 seconds boredom. i know the meter's off but why change it? i'm too lazy.

           Lo and behold, drivers education yields something useful.        Boredom is instilled in my mind, i feel the urge to post. I don't know what i'm going to say or even what i'm saying at this point, i just know my personalities are ok temporarily. Emphasis on temporarily. I'm trying to find words to say, to present what is reality, to show what isn't tangible. I'm here for a reason, but what it is lately i sometimes wonder.......I'm not going for what I believe and i think that may be a good thing, since all I believe is all that's holding me back. I wish I had turrets so i could let out how I feel in an endless stream of words not allowed, and not be persecuted for it. I am going against my friend's best wishes, not doing what I know is right, but who cares? Who cares what is right and what is wrong? Who cares what will happen? I know one thing and one thing only: I'm temporarily satisfied. Sometimes you wish time had a rollback and distances weren't so far, that you could jump a mile in one step and not worry about it anymore, but instead you have distance. Distance means time, time means more to cover, and blood, sweat, and tears. Reality is what we make it, and we make it not real sometimes. this is the way it is. I have accepted this and I hope you do too.

      Oh drivers ed that doth so comely teach and deny my inner flesh's lust of driving fast and getting high to wonder why someday i'll drive in fields of concrete,oh so grey and wonder how i may die today with druggies, speedbumps, and trains i see that it will become part of me. I wish for this freedom so my inner sanctum refined i wish to eat a lot and mostly drive.

           Recently i've been a little insane. Just slightly. My multiple personality is taking over and it's an ugly thing, it is...really. One's name is jimbo, he's the crazy, outgoing one, one's name is jimmy, he's the one that's laid back and doesn't care, and the last one is jim, the one that's never sure and is always pissed about something. I'd rather have Jimbo around b/c he takes the risks, but i know that jim is lurking in the backround saying "wtf would you do that for?! you've been through this before!! Don't kid yourself!" Meanwhile jimmy's just saying chill out and smoke a joint. But i definitely won't do that. Also i have this other personality that is named Larry and he's a Mexican that just randomly shouts curse words at eskimos.        Yah, i missed newfound glory and that sucks, but i don't care, it was funny watching my teacher get pissed.......really.       I'm still undecided, what should i do? Let my decision push people away, or maybe it will help and lead to getting hurt again in the end. Post ur comments, advice plz.       Now i leave you for today with this "Don't kill the monkey before it eats the banana, because then you don't get to eat the banana."

           Yah well, mollie and liz got me into this but hey, livejournal.com was too confusing and i like this better cause it's easy. So get over it. Anyway, a little about me.........       I'm a weird kid. Not that weird is always a bad thing, but even a good thing can be bad when it's messed up. I don't think that many people understand that, but it works out, just think about it. I tend to wear everything I know and feel on my sleeve, and it creates a lot of problems, in life, in love, and in other shiznit. It makes people trust me, and yet not feel comfortable at the same time. I've never really had problems making friends, or being made fun of despite my size and looks. I never really understood that fact. A lot of times in my life i'm viewed as "the kid that's there for you, the good friend" and sometimes that gets old. I don't want to be the kid who's "friendship people don't want to mess up" and "let's stay friends" shit.        Thanx to mollie and liz for hanging out with me at drivers ed, which i have newly taken up and it's fun because of that. Sam, ur cool and so are u Colton. Yes these are my driver's ed buddies. Now that i have u guy's sn's and liz's phone #, life could be a lot more interesting........j/k. Now all i need is mollie's #............       It sucks.....I should be going to a concert tomorrow night..but i'm not. Driver's ed got in the way of that. I'm missing out on newfound glory for a bunch of useful information that will probably save my life.........good trade (in a way).       Well that's it for now. I'll write lata.

      Yes here I am once again after a long time, finally blogging once more. New things in my life....Well let's see...       I've been working like a Mexican pack horse lately at work, not that I don't like work so don't get me wrong, but the fact is it's an adventure everday. Today I dropped a huge-ass dock piling on my foot and it only weighed like 600 pounds. No big deal. Hurts like hell, but at least it's not broken. Wow I'm actually talking to Beth right now and we're not flipping out, we're being cool with each other. What brought about this sudden change in our hatred toward each other? Who knows, this is just the way it turned out and I'm willing to go along with it. I suppose I'll have to get used to it if she's going to the same school as me next year. I think there's a time to grow up, a time to forget the past, and a time to start new and pretend that the past never existed and everything is new. New to the fact that past ENEMIES can become friends again, and new to the fact that we're willing.        Mollie's now in Long Island still, and I miss her. I visited her house and we walked in the woods for a while (during which time I was raped repeatedly by massive swarms of satanic, bloodthirsty, hell-hounds known as mosquitoes) and had a lot of fun while she flipped out about all the mosquitoes on my back and proceded to slap me repeatedly on the back and neck and shoulders and head. You would've thought that she was trying to kill me. Then she felt all bad because she brought me into the woods and said it was her fault that I got bit a million times. Whatever, I dont' get it. Mollie I would take a million mosquitoe bites if it means spending time with you.       Here's a tibit that I just thought up:  You're a pain in the ass so shut the fuck up.       Not in the poetic mood today. Oh well, if you're offended do this: Read the tidbit one more time.
