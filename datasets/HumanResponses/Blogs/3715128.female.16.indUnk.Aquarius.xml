      Yeah, well had a busy, productive day. Well got up did stuff, no one else home all day-fun stuff, then out of a very odd impulse------I wanted to clean. For those who don’t know me I hate to clean house and stuff. Mom always has to tell me to do the dishwasher and stuff. So, yeah. I know, I was stunned myself. So let’s see what all did I do? Well first I unloaded and reloaded the dishwasher. Next I got on the computer and cleaned out a couple of my Corel Word folders. Then I washed dishes by hand.(1) I cleaned the counter, stove and skins.(2) Then later I made supper, another something I never do, pancakes, some with chocolate chips in them. Yum. Next I went to praise team.(3) (wow lots of numbers this time) I like praise team. Came home and went out to finish the lawn. Mom had started it yesterday and stopped, because it was getting late and she was tired. Well I guess she had forgotten about it, but I saw the cut grass when we got home. So I finished that. Mom and Dad were shocked. I guess it is a kinda new thing for me to the mow the lawn, but still...*shrug. I also printed a book of jokes out, it’s going to be a gift....can’t tell who for, tho they probably read this anyway. Yup, very busy day. :-D Woop.    1)Some of the stuff is to big for the dishwasher. Some had wood for the handles and stuff, mom doesn’t want those in the dishwasher, bad for them or something.  2) We hardly ever clean that stuff, not that it needs it to awfully bad.  3) Praise team-something at church. Youth sing before the services. On Wednesdays we go pick out the songs and practice them.

           Well I went over to my grandpa’s and helped him pick beans from his garden. I also helped my grandma with a funny costume for a play she’s in. We had a real good meal. Freshly picked, cooked, beans and pork. Really good, for dessert we had butter pecan ice cream. Then we went to visit my aunt Jeanette(1) that was fun too. Bill, her husband, was there already. We did a word jumble puzzle from the paper and talked some. Then grandpa and I headed home. So it was a busy day. Dad seems to be doing alright, not throwing-up anymore, which is good. He says he’s head is feeling better...he might just be saying that tho. He keeps saying he’ll be all better tomorrow. Oy. Hope he’ll get better soon. Watched Smokey and the Bandit yesterday. :-) Voom! So that’s about it I think.                 1) Jeanette is in a nursing home, Miami Shores. Her backbone is bent weird and had other stuff too. We trying to get a custom wheelchair thingy for her, hopefully can get that. Her husband Bill has a dog, Billy, who is very energetic and lovable, she keeps Bill on his toes.

      1)my grandma has alzimiers, and I don’t think that’s spelled right, disease where you can’t remember stuff, so she probably won’t even miss the chair. I’m not very good at remembering to put up the explaining numbers, must run in the family.

                Shane and I went bike riding on the Taylorsville Path, it’s in Vandaila, Ohio. It was about 13 to 14 miles I think. Crazy. Shane talked the whole way too, which required me talking while trying to remain breathing and keeping up with him. Sheesh. It was really fun though, then we got us ice cream from Dairy Queen. Thanks Shane, if you read this. He also told me a secret which I can hardly stand to keep. Oy! But don’t worry Shane I will, and to anyone else, forget it! 	Dad’s sick, feeling yucky and all that fun stuff, the doctors think he has something called Ramsey’s Hunt Syndrome, which is like shingles inside the ear. He’s not going to be going to church tomorrow. Poor Dad.  	Then after Shane left mom and I talked about Sarah, and Shane some too. :-) Nothing bad. Then mom and I looked at pictures of when I was five. (1) I had the chicken pocks, only mine hurt....a lot! I was miserable. At least mom says I was, I don’t really remember. That could be a good thing I guess. Yup. So that’s about it, now I think I’ll go to bed, since there’s church tomorrow and all.

               Well, my poor dad. This morning, while I was still asleep my mom took my dad to the emergency room. Oy. Well dad’s head has been hurting a lot, and he’s a guy who doesn’t complain when he is hurt or sick. Well his ear has really been bothering him and his throat has been sore. He even went to the doctor and got medication. Well anyway yesterday his face and lip started to go numb and he passed it off as nothing. Today one half of his face went totally numb and limp. So they went to the emergency room and the doctor said it was Bell’s Palsy, which isn’t really serious. They don’t have much medication for it and it could go away in a couple days or a couple months. So we’ll hope it goes away soon. Mom and I drove up to Greenville to get a recliner from my grandma(1) for dad to sleep in since he’s having trouble sleeping.  	And, exciting and scary, I drove for about a half hour on the way back, from Greenville, it’s about a 45 minute drive. So it was fun...I guess, kinda. 	I went on a bike ride around my block and I was riding with no hands on the handle bars. My block has lots of cul-de-sac and as I was going around and there was a little gir,l standing in her driveway. And her eyes got soooo wide, her jaw was dropped! It was really funny, as I just went around the half circle with no hands on the handle bars. I laughed afterward, a lot. tehehehe. Oh, by the way, if you’ve never ridden on your bike with no hands on the handle bars don’t go out and do it. I mean, don’t start out on your bike and take your hands off the handle bars all of a sudden. That’s what I did at first. Ok, well I was riding my bike and I saw these guys ride past with no hands on the handle bars. Well I immediately took my hands off the handle bars. Now I didn’t fall flat on my face, luckily, I kinda fell off the seat and landed standing up. It still hurt tho. So I tried it again on another bike ride, I took my hands off the handle bars for a few seconds at the time until I got the hang of it. Now I can ride standing up, legs braced, and ride with no hands on the handle bars....that’s at the same time. :-) So I’ve come a long way. Yeah, well...that’s about it and I better go to bed now, because it’s kinda late and...yeah, I need my sleep. So...night! *Runs away, tail swishing*

      Ok, so I'm Rrr as you could maybe possibly tell from the title and web site. If not . . . well. . . then I'm telling you now . . . I'm Rrr. The one and only Rrr there is. No, you cannot steal my name. It's mine. All mine! Yeah so . . . I’m kinda not too much very old, and yes I know I’m using lots of extra unneed words, even words that aren’t words . . . this is my blog I’ll do what I want with it. So bleah! . *sticks out tongue* Anyway not too old, teen. And I’m kinda very secretive so don’t be so surprised. Well I am female human . . . actually not all human. (Technically, yes I am but I pretend I’m not so get used to it or don’t read my blog buddy) :-). Yeah so, I’m part cat . . . ever seen the anime character Inuyasha? Well if not . . . look it up because I don’t want to explain. You can probably find a picture somewhere of him, that’s all you really need. And then make him, female, kitty ears . . . they look pretty much the same as his, still has the fangs and claws, tail, (#, forget this for now, it will come later) change the outfit. . . I don’t care what . . . actually yes I do . . . nothing perverted or anything . . . decent clothes. Sheesh, ok sorry, back to changing Inuyasha to me . . . Lavender . . . another name for me . . .don’t ask . . . anyway . . . where was I? Oy . . . ok, before I go back to what I was saying . . . oy-it’s my word I made it up . . . no it’s not the religious kinda oy or French oui or whatever . . . it’s oy. Something I say when there’s either nothing else to say, I’m exasperated, I’m frustrated, I’m confused but saying oy because it will get me out of having to know what you’re talking about, when I’m rolling my eyes oy usually follows, um . . . that’s some of the meaning of oy. Ok,now that you're totally confused, back to what I was saying, about Inuyasha into a cat called Lavender. (Go to the # sign since I use * signs to show an action of some sort . . . yes that’s is what it means) ok so still has fangs, claws, add a tail, which won’t be stepped on by anybody who wants to live, and I think that's about it . . . oh . . . eyes . . . green cat eyes too. That’s why I will be making references to kitty actions, that is my new thing. And the color of my fur/hair-creamy white, with pink tufts on the ears and end of tail. Ok, well, other information. By the way I know this would drive an English teacher crazy or anyone else who loves order for that matter, but it’s very hard to just describe me without adding things in describing the things that describe me. :-), got that? Maybe I could have those things in books where you put a number by a certain thing then go to it at the bottom of the page and look it up. I’ll try to do that from now on, because I’m too lazy to go back and fix it, and I would just to delete all this because it wouldn’t apply anymore. Ok, sorry again back to other information now . . . back to your previously scheduled program . . . tehehehe. I like D&D . . . dungeons and dragons . . . I play video games. Hang out with the church youthies and Shane. (1)(that means go to the bottom of the page or wherever there’s a number one, ;-)...) Play Sims, wee, Makin’ Magic and Pets, and a Deluxe version, and of course the original. Boyfriend: none, never had one, won’t have one until I find someone who I like and they like me back . . . might be a while. Likewise never been kissed . . . don’t get any ideas (bares fangs and claws, hissing menacingly) Job: bleah, none . . . don’t want one, sigh, being told constantly to get one by parents . . .refuse . . . for a while, until I want some money. Drive: not quite, do have my temps . . . don’t use them too often, but I have them. Sheltered: Completely. Oy. Very, very, very sheltered. School: Junior this August, well now, but when school starts I will be in 11th grade.Weeee, upper classmen/woman, oh joy. Ok, so let’s see is that it? Hmmm, well that’s it for now. Hope you didn’t get too lost on your tour of the infamous Rrrrrrrrrrrrr.  1) the youthies are the youth group members at my church, which mostly just consist of Shawn,Greg, and Paul . . . or collectively the Stouts, no there not dwarfs or anything it’s just a nickname. (Oh, me too, I'm a youthy as well) Well I listed them from oldest to youngest, one just out of high school, one’s last year and one just starting I think. And I don’t like any of them as boyfriends or anything, so forget it. Oh and Shane is the youth leader, in his 20's, he’s cool, annoying, they gang up on me and pick on me, but I pick on them right back so it’s ok. Shane is also currently the boyfriend of my Sister, Sarah, and works for my dad, he has a plastering company. Plus my dad’s also recently the pastor of our church which we (my family . . . mom, dad, Sarah, and me . . . I . . . whatever) came to um, let’s see *mentally counts* about seven years ago, maybe. And he’s been pastor two years in August. Yeah, so I’m not really too much of a PK(pastors’ kid)

      Dearest Zeke, Mother, and Father,      My travels fare well. I have come upon a humble human town. There is but a few elves  here. I have met one and am currently traveling with him. He is an unusual sort, he was raised  among these humans, he is younger than one hundred years, that much is clear. He has a rather  unhealthy habit of lecherous actions, or that is it will become unhealthy should he try these  actions on my person. I sought him out, as I hungered for an elven face, at the time I didn’t know  of his lewd behaviors. As it turns out, he’s a cleric and the local priest. He even goes so far as to  practice his “habits” on his adopted family. He invited me to stay for dinner, which mislead me  to thinking him to have some gentlemen manners. He has three adopted sisters and a single  parent, the youngest is Luna, the middle child is Soleil, the eldest is called by Winter, and his  mother’s name is Melissa. Winter invited me to stay the night, as a result to  the urging of Anual,  the cleric. Early the next morning we met with our other companions. One a halfling and the  other a human. The halfling had a poor disguise and is known as Cancain, while the human, one  of mysterious origin, is called Kell. We then go on an adventure into a system of sewers or  catacombs, it was called as both. We got fifty gold pieces before leaving and a promise of more  gold upon return should we bring back a particular disc. One was given a small sphere, should  we need a quick return to the tower we left from. We travel through the sewers, hunting for this  disc, along the way we meet and assail with peculiar creatures, composed of metal. After much  search, we come to a room, inside is a few metal tables and some coffins. Two of the coffins lie  open, and the other is closed tight. There is a door opposite the one form which we came, from  the other side we can hear peoples trying to force their way in. The party quickly upturns a table  and conceal ourselves behind it. As they manage to open the door my companions open fire on  their unsuspecting victims, though they would, must likely, be pilfering bandits anyway. We find  our bandits are a half-orc, a female halfling, a gnome, and a human. We cut down each of the  troublesome beasts. We then leave the sewers by way of the sphere’s power, carry with us  everything we have found, and I do mean everything. Along with a human woman who was in  the last coffins and the disc. The human woman, who at first sight appeared dead, seems a   bit . . . shall we say, unearthly. Upon return, we are given one hundred gold each, for our  services. Cancain and Kell quickly sell off the items we brought back with us, splitting the  profits equally. To Anual’s chagrin we also find that is sister Soleil has gone missing. The party  splits with Kell taking to bed, trying to gain back his strength, Cancain off to do some unlawful  dealings, and Anual and myself off to search for his sister. As of yet, we have not found any sign  of her and only a few leads, which do little to aid our search.  I hope this finds you all in good  health. Please send word back, these people’s company is trying and nothing like what I am used  to.                             Yours Truly,                                           Jubilee Rieka Amara                                                                                                                                        Dearest Zeke, Mother, and Father,      While Anual continued his frantic search for his beloved and lost sister I went to visit the  wizards and learn all I could from their wisdom. Upon the return of my new companions I  learned Anual’s sister had never been kidnaped, but in fact had not informed her family of where  she was going. From the other half of our group came a story of an elf that they had dueled and  after defeating him shaved his head. They are very odd companions to have.  I’m sure my being  with them is a mistake. At least I might be able to keep them out of some trouble. We went back  to the wizard’s stronghold where we spoke with Cassandra, of whom had helped us with our first  quest. She spoke to us of another quest, she also mentioned a picture she had seen me in and  thought I was a friend with someone known as Patrick Kilplow. She showed this picture to me  and I do see the similarities between us, would you know anything about this? We then went to  start are next adventure, Megan, a paladin, led us to an old and abandoned temple. It was  devoted to Pelar.  We were soon to find that thralls dwelled in this place. We started to assail the  thralls after they had opened the door leading underground. With them were human peasants,  prisoners, as it appeared. I used my newly learned spells to help ward off the offensive creatures.  I hope to hear your words soon. I send with this letter my deepest affection and love.                             With Love,                                     Jubilee Rieka Amara                 Dearest Zeke, Mother, and Father,      We defeated the troublesome thralls. Then, from the path with which we had come,  appeared to female humans. One was familiar, the girl whom we had rescued earlier from the  underground tunnels, the other a noble lady by the name of Dawn. We continued underground to  be met by more thralls.  They were already engaged with strange humans. They wore dragon  symbols and a few members of the party recognized them as dragon worshipers. They gave  human sacrifices to them. Not knowing if they would try to harm us or not, we joined the fray.  The dragon people were going down fast as we battled with the closest thralls. I kept my  distance and used both arrow and spell to aid my companions. The dragon leader was soon alone  in his desperate battle with the beast, but with a muttered incantation the dead around him arose  to fight. We finished off the thralls and the dragon man turned to us, a mad look was in his eyes,  I could see it even from my distance. He was down in a matter of minutes, along with nearly half  the party. Anual used his healing skills to aid our friends while I went to examine the thralls and  dragon leader. On one of the thralls was a ring and on the dragon man a black headband. I took  these with care, hope they were not evil items. The woman we brought back from the caves, who  Anual calls Dancia, told me the ring would aid with an archer’s shot and the band could boost  one’s intelligence when worn. I put both items on and went to see how my companions fared.   Still gravely injured and Anual out of spells we left the caverns and rested the night outside,  where the stench was not as foul. Upon morning we went again into the abandoned temple of  Pelar. We came to a clear pool of water. Cancain bent and tasted the water, informing us it was  fresh. Everyone filled their water skins, Dawn recalled that there was said to be a pool of healing  water and wondered if this was it. Anual, still weak from yesterdays fight, drank from his  waterskin. It was healing water, he drank as much as he could, then refilled the skin to bring to  the one who had stayed on the surface. The company backtracked and went to another room.  Inside was a giant thrall, larger than any, and two young children. When we entered the thrall  stepped forward, in a protective fashion, in front of the children. The little girl stepped behind  him while the boy put a hand to a small sword at his belt. Everyone immediately tried to restrain  Kell. Dawn stepped forward, to try and talk us out of the bad situation. We found out the thrall  was called Galdrax and the two children were his servants. We quickly saw that fighting him  might be a mistake and that freeing the children would probably only upset them more. They  tremble at the sight of us. We backed out of the room, Anual wanted to fight the beast and free  the children and tried to provoke the thrall. He didn’t seem to think to highly of elves. I did want  to help the children as much as he did, but I don’t think they wanted to be rescued and, by the  looks of it, were happy where they were. We left the caverns and evacuated a village near by  before going back to town. When we arrived the mages asked if I wanted to learn some new  spells. Of course I said yes. We got a new mission and went down into more caverns and  encountered more metal people. I blasted them away with magic missiles. Hope to hear from                             you soon.                             With Love,                                          Jubilee Rieka Amara                                                      Dearest Zeke, Mother, and Father,      I would hope this letter finds you all in good health. I fare well in my travels with my  somewhat unusual companions. We are still in the caverns as we were and have been in for  sometime. Today our ventures led us to parry with more metallic creatures, along with those  metal beasts were a pair of large beatles. One of our party, Kell, chose one to ride through the  caverns. Later we encountered a wolf also composed of metal, which I took an immediate liking  to. The beatle creatures had a disliking for halflings, which could be a problem because one in  our group is such a halfling. The wolf, to which I mounted upon with aid from Anual-surprising  as that is, doesn’t care for humans. This also is a problem since we have three in our party with  us currently. I would hate to have to harm my new found friend of a wolf, whom I now call  DarkStorm. The wolf seems to have no objection to my riding upon it so I do travel onward with  it. The party had a most controversial meeting with a few of our past foes and three new humans.  After long and ineffective negotiations with these such foes we went into battle between our two  unyielding parties. During this most futile conference I tried to coax my wolf into allying with  myself and companions. We made short notice of their leader, a very aggravating administrator.  He was soon to be followed by a gnome. My group member, Kell, tried to sway the half-orc to  our side; this has such forth been unpersuasive to the rather dull-witted orc. One human-a mage  and the halfling made a getaway when the going got tough. Currently the other human, a female  wielding two swords, has stopped fighting while the half-orc called Guck is frozen by Anual’s  spell. I still am positioned upon my wolf and hope to continue to have such a companion. I long      to hear your words and feel much love toward my family.                                               With Love,                        Jubilee Rieka Amara                 Dearest Zeke, Mother, and Father,      The company and I have continued our adventuring. We recently went to a rather exotic  play. Anual was so good as to take his sisters and I shopping. At one of the more extravagant  stores I purchased a royal dress, though I am unsure if we will happen to have an occasion for it.  I am sure at least Mother would want to know the more finer details of the attire so I shall  describe it forthwith. It has a deep lavender coloring to it and is made of the finest velvet, the  sleeves are made of a rather flimsy, gossamer fabric that reaches midway past the elbow and is  held there with small ties. The fabric allows everyone to notice my brand of Boccob’s symbol on  my upper arm. The neck line comes to a low V; but don’t worry, not extremely low. The collar  on it is laced with diamonds and other such fineries. The waist also curves to a V-shape, while  the skirt fans out allowing plenty of room to move in. The waist is set off by a lovely gold silk  sash that ties on the right side in a loose knot. To accompany this fine dress I also bought some  dazzling jewel. Atop my head is a not-too-fancy golden wreath of leaves; at the forehead dangles  a pale pink diamond-shaped jewel. At my neck is my usual gold Ehlonna necklace, which I must  say, compliments the dress. Each arm has three gold bracelets.  The back of both hands is  covered with mesh gold that clasps around the wrist and is attached to a gold ring on the middle  finger of each hand. The shoes I picked out are gold-colored sandals that lace up to mid-calf. Oh,  how I wish you could see the ensemble; it really is marvelous. I only hope the occasion should  come that I will need it, but with my current company...  I miss you all so very much and dearly           hope this letter reaches you in high spirits.                            With Love,                                            Jubilee Rieka Amara

      K, not much going on since last time so this is going to be pretty random. Um....well working  more on bible school games, I have to get all the stuff together for it. Waiting to hear from Jen  from the church more about the songs we’re going to sing for SB(bible school). D&D’s been fun  so far, kinda confusing about what we’re doing at the moment but oh well. And my character is  kinda out of place with her companions. She’s an elf princess and has gotten stuck with a three  not law abiding guys and a diplomatic woman. Oy. What’s a poor girl to do. Can’t wait for 7th  level, Cat person! YAY! Though I don’t think the spell last for very long. Grrrr. Have to maybe  do something about that. Hmm. Yay Anual, Shane’s character, saved me from being killed, must  remember to be nice to him.....well....not to mice of course. Someone has to keep him in line.  Um....so, don’t know what else. School coming up. Bleah! Oy. And road trip mom and I are  going on, to Wisconsin to visit my great Uncle Lyle and Aunt Maxine. Oy, that will  be......quite...a trip. *shudder* Oy. Stuck in the car with only mom for how many miles.......*sobs  in the corner* Pray for me, and my sanity. Oy. Yeah so that’s about it I guess. I think I’ll put my  journal entries for D&amp;D on my blog. Oh, and I saw on movies.com that Catwoman wasn’t so  good, how sad. I still want to see it though, their to harsh on things anyway. So.....bye! *runs off  tail swishing*

       I guess it’s been a while since I posted so I’ll post again. I’ve been working on the power point  stuff more. And I’m in charge of bible school recreation so I’ve been coming up with games for  that along with typing in the songs for bible school, fun songs. I stared scanning pictures in, all  10,000+ of them. (1) Oy. Shane’s back from counseling horse camp at Woodland Altars. (2)  Went and saw my Aunt Carol’s play, she directed it. And my grandma, her mom, was in it too. It  was called Honk and was based off the ugly duckling story, really long but really good. The  people were dressed in normal clothes that gave the idea of what animal there were playing. It  was really neat. Afterwards I went to Shane’s for D&D but they had already played. But it was  still really really fun! I asked about a certain spell I had been wondering about for a while. I’m  an elf in the game and a wizard. And when I get to the 7th level there’s a spell called polymorh  self. With this spell you can change into any animal you want for a time period. Well I wanted to  know if I could change into my CatAngel person, as I decided that would be her name. And the  DM, Chris, said yes! YAY! So I’m happy about that, she can even purr. And if you didn’t know  the reason cat’s can purr is because they have extra cartilage in the back of their tongue that they  can vibrate. Isn’t that cool, and the bigger cats have bone instead to roar. I thought that was neat.  Plus Shane, playing his character Anual, took his sister and my character, Jubilee shopping  where I bought a royal dress and jewelry. The whole thing cost me about 220 gold pieces but I  still have like 400 gold left so it’s ok. And Chris encourages the campaign players to make  journals, which I’m mostly the only one who does, due to time. In my journal entries I write  home to my family and in the last one I wrote and told about my dress which I will put in here.   :-) And that’s about it so, see ya!. *happily bounds away, tail swishing*     Dearest Zeke, Mother, and Father,      The company and I have continued our adventuring. We recently went to a rather exotic  play. Anual was so good as to take his sisters and I shopping. At one of the more extravagant  stores I purchased a royal dress, though I am unsure if we will happen to have an occasion for it.  I am sure at least Mother would want to know the more finer details of the attire so I shall  describe it forthwith. It has a deep lavender coloring to it and is made of the finest velvet, the  sleeves are made of a rather flimsy, gossamer fabric that reaches midway past the elbow and is  held there with small ties. The fabric allows everyone to notice my brand of Boccob’s symbol on  my upper arm. The neck line comes to a low V; but don’t worry, not extremely low. The collar  on it is laced with diamonds and other such fineries. The waist also curves to a V-shape, while  the skirt fans out allowing plenty of room to move in. The waist is set off by a lovely gold silk  sash that ties on the right side in a loose knot. To accompany this fine dress I also bought some  dazzling jewel. Atop my head is a not-too-fancy golden wreath of leaves; at the forehead dangles  a pale pink diamond-shaped jewel. At my neck is my usual gold Ehlonna necklace, which I must  say, compliments the dress. Each arm has three gold bracelets.  The back of both hands is  covered with mesh gold that clasps around the wrist and is attached to a gold ring on the middle  finger of each hand. The shoes I picked out are gold-colored sandals that lace up to mid-calf. Oh,  how I wish you could see the ensemble; it really is marvelous. I only hope the occasion should  come that I will need it, but with my current company . . .   I miss you all so very much and  dearly hope this letter reaches you in high spirits.                            With Love,                                           Jubilee Rieka Amara                                    1) Mom takes pictures out the wazoo! We literally have ten thousand pictures and probably  more!   2) Church camp in Peebles, Ohio.

      Yeah, Shane was bugging me to update so I guess I will. Right now my hands are knida sore  from typing so much. The church got power point and I’ve been typing in the songs for it. Lots  and lots of typing. I just finished this weeks service’s power point. :-) Yay. Had praise team  yesterday then hung out with Shane for a while. I got to watch some Inuyasha! Cute ears!!!!!  Awwwww. Yeah, then we got ice cream, yummy. I think that’s about it. So...bye. *bounds away  tail swishing*

      ﻿Yeah not much going on. Sarah went back to Maryland, Shane still gone having taken her over, by way of Washington D.C. Healing up pretty well. Sarah made me a sling before, which was really nice to have since I couldn’t straighten my arm and had to hold it up all the time. I liked my sling. But I’ve stopped having to use it. *sad sigh* oh well. Shane, Sarah, Dad, and I played some Diablo and Egyptian RatScrew. That was fun, and kinda painful. Especially since Shane used his whole arm to slap. Oy. That was Thursday night I think. Then Shane, Sarah, and I watched a Jackie Chan movie, Rush Hour 2. Afterwards I got shooed away after saying good-bye to Sarah. Didn’t do much Friday. Oh, except get a new fan in Sarah/my room.(1) Also took her room back. It’s a really nice fan. Lately I’ve been using a small one and blowing it on my face while I sleep. But mom says that’s bad for me and since I can hardly sleep without it we got a ceiling fan. I used it last night. Very very nice. *sigh* So that’s all. Dad and I just went bike riding, it was fun. He’s doing better it seems, though I was kinda dizzy he said. Oh, never doubt the SpiderCatgirl’s power.......mostly just cat......you can call me....duh, duh, duh, DUH.........CopyCat.....or......The Panther. I haven’t decided. Or maybe CatAngel.......oh the possibilities. *bounds away tail swishing menacingly*    1) Sarah has a bigger and nicer bed than I do so just recently I’ve been sleeping in there while she’s gone. I had to move out of her room when she came home though. Grrr. Now I have it back. :-D yay.

      ﻿Yeah well yesterday woke up got on the computer for a while. Then when Sarah woke up I followed her around to store up on time spent with her. She went through ex-boyfriend stuff and organized it and dealt with it. Then Shane came over and He, Sarah, and me were going to go bike riding. Well, I got my hair cut first by mom, and then we were off. Mom and I were in her car with Sarah and my bikes and Sarah and Shane were in his car with his bike. Mom was just driving us there then waiting around to drive us back. So they went one way and we went the other, they had a head start so they would probably get there before us. Well, turns out they didn’t, we waited around 15 minutes then they showed up. Shane was in la la land and went to the office instead, tho why Sarah didn’t say something I have no idea. So as we were getting out Sarah’s seat was to high, because Dad had ridden it when he and I went. They played around with that, I don’t know if they fixed it or not, while I tried to get my chain back on my bike, oy. Shane came over and fixed it for me, getting his hands all black in the process. Mom commented that maybe someone was trying to tell us it was a bad day to go bike riding. Well, we were finally off. So we rode, a mosquito flew right in my eye while we were riding so we had to stop and Sarah got it out. Boy does that hurt. And we continued. It was a nine mile trip and on the fifth mile me and my bike met the ground. It was my fault so I kinda knew it was coming. Ok so I turned to sharp while going to fast and started to fall to the left, I think I put my foot down and that helped and I came down on my left knee, right hand and right elbow. My elbow’s the worse scraped up, but didn’t hurt to bad. Then my knee, which really I hardly even noticed. And last my hand with two measly cuts. Well ironically it was my hand that was hurting the most, at the time. So we continued on. When we got home we had some ice cream then mom helped me clean my wounds. You know that’s the worst part of getting hurt. Having to clean it. Ouch. So that really really stung. I now have two band-aids on my hand, a large band-aid on my knee and I piece of gauze and a wrap on my elbow. Oy. So that was exciting. Oh, and if that wasn’t enough I also got nine huge mosquito bites. Oy. While Shane got one, that he said didn’t even itch and Sarah got none. What is up with that? I’m always the one to get bit, and I’m the one who likes bugs, except mosquitos and flies and stuff.   Ok so today. Got up and had to take a shower. Oy. *dread* well it wasn’t to bad. I mostly kept my right arm up and out of the water. And tried to take a one-handed shower. It worked for the most part. So now I’m waiting for 11:30a.m. to come around. Mom, Sarah, and I are going up to Greenville to see Spiderman 2. Then visit my Grandma Hamm, the one with the forgetting disease which I don’t know how to spell. Then go back home and visit Jeanette. So pardon me, I’m going to become................................................duh, duh, duh, DUH......SpiderCatgirl!!!!!*uses new web slinging stuff to swing away*

      I think this does make five entries Shane. :-D Well a really long time ago I started writing this weird story called Magic Box. Then like a year ago or more I changed it around and made it like a Harry Potter story. Basically the first Harry Potter book from my new character’s point of view with a bunch of extra stuff and things from the third book, like Sirius Black(1). So yeah. I was reading through it yesterday and day before. Well I added more onto it today. I’m so proud. Because I had gotten stuck. Actually I’m still stuck, but I’m going to try and get unstuck. Yay. I guess it is kinda plagiarism, but I’m not going to sell it or anything, and I’m probably the only one who would want to read it so, bleah. Yeah, so.....bye! *bounds away quickly, looking around warily for lawyers or something*  1)For the longest time I didn’t know how to pronounce Sirius. Well mom then told me it was s, long I, rus. (Like a farmer’s scythe-rus) So I got use to it like that. And then I found out it was pronounced serious. Grrrr. Which is what I thought it was before mom told me, scythe-rus. So now I have to get use to it being pronounced right. Oy.

Um.....Watched X-Men, even tho I have both-I hadn’t seen just X-Men in a while. Mom got home. Ate. On computer more. Took a shower. All clean. On computer. Oh! Mom and I went to U.D.F....also known as United Dairy Farmers. Got a shake. Chocolate. Yum. Ate some of that. Sarah’s back! Yay! Have to give her room back to her. Boo. She’s leaving Friday. Ya...oh wait......boo.  That’s what I meant. ;-) It’s good to have her home. Yay. We’re thinking of going to see Spiderman 2 on Wednesday. Yay. So I guess that’s about it. Oh Shane got back too. Since he was the one bringing her back. So, I guess I’ll be on the Internet more. Or see if Sarah wants to play Monopoly or something. Bye.

      Yeah, well I was to tired to write yesterday so I’m going to pretend today is the fourth so there. Pbthhh*sticks out tongue* Well went to church, not very many people there. Shawn Stout was there, I was amazed. Larry Lutz, newly licenced pastor or something, preached. Dad’s still at Annual Conference. Shane’s still in Maryland picking up Sarah.....hope he doesn’t drop her, lol. Sorry just too tempting. Um, so yeah. Went home did stuff. Kelly and Roger(1) invited us over for left-over picnic stuff, that was good. Then mom and I went a picked more beans. Oy. She says we picked like ten gallons of beans. Come have some, well there at the office now. Oy. Then we came home. Some neighbors down the street were setting off some fireworks, so we went out to watch and clapped loudly. I wonder what they thought of our clapping, they didn’t see us any time. Then we went to Lisa and Jeff Hendricks vet place(2) in Tipp. to watch Tipp. fireworks. Well we ended up being able to see like five different shows of fireworks. Tipp.’s and Troy’s and people’s who were randomly setting them off in their backyards. Then we went home and went to bed. After trying, unsuccessfully, to light up some sparklers. So that it for today. Pretty fireworks, just be careful of your fingers.   1) Roger is my dad’s older brother. Kelly is his wife. They have to sons, Michael and David.  2) People at church.

      Well, I went and saw Harry Potter 3 today. It was really good....tho it didn’t follow the book hardly at all. It was crazy. But still very good. I would tell more about it but I know there are some who haven’t seen it yet so I won’t spoil anything for them. Mom insisted we watch all the credits too, and I mean all the credits. There were feet walking around the Marauder’s Map....and at the end...well if you want to know go to (1)...it’s really not that exciting. Talked to Sarah in Maryland too. Yay. Shane’s up there picking her up. Well that’s it for now I guess, I’m now going to go read the book....I think I like the book better. Hmph, they skipped so many good parts....oy! *goes off mumbling to self*    1) At the very end Harry’s voice says Mischief Managed and then Nox. That’s it....mom made me sit through all those credits for that. Sheesh.

      Well, Shane’s been bugging me to update so I guess I better. So, let’s see, what to talk about... Well, dad went to Annual Conference, it’s just me and mom now, oy. Went grocery shopping with Shane yesterday, had to get out of the house. We got ice cream then went to look at some cars. Oy, what is it about cars? Trying to get mom to take me to see Harry Potter 3. Oh boy. Hmmm. Well this kitty is tired. *bounds off to curl up in a sunbeam somewhere* Nice warm sun. *purrs contently*

      Just got back from my road trip. It was fun. Visited people and went to a wolf park, and there was this guy who had just moved there from France. He had a cool accent and he was pretty cute too. But the wolves were cute too. And then later that night we went back for howl night. That was really fun. There was a big group that came and someone talked about the wolves and then we all howled and the wolves howled back at us. And three wolves came up to the fence and played with the workers there, they went in with them. It looked really fun. In two more years I could go in with the wolves, though I’d have to be either a worker, a volunteer, or a sponsor. *sigh* Then when we got back, Sat. night, I had to do the power point for Sun. Oy. Plus since Indiana is on different times I had already lost an hour of sleep. Very tired today. Slept for three hours when we got home from church, long catnap. Sarah’s home tomorrow! Yay! Can’t wait to see sissy! School starts in a week. Bleah! And I think I’ve decided to take French, so have to switch that up. My... “Secret”...is bothering me. Oy. Hope that stops. I’ll tell you my... “secret”...later. Wouldn’t want someone else to find out. :-) Oh and while on our road trip we went to this store mom used to work at, and she said we had to buy something, for old time sake. So I bought the tape Rock-A-Doodle. I really liked that tape when I was little, so I watched that. It’s really cute, but it doesn’t have one of the songs. It’s very sad. So I’m getting it at the library to see that scene. :-) So that’s it.....bye. *runs off tail swishing*

      Dearest Zeke, Mother, and Father, We have fought more metal creatures. Anual and Dawn were knighted, along with a wizard boy I have not met, a human, and a half-orc who has joined our party. As I understand it he was told to keep an eye on us. There was another casket with another sister in it. I have not gotten a chance to get more spells from Patrick. During our downtime I went and bought a black, velvet, hooded cloak with a unicorn on one side. Cancain was resurrected by the sister we found. Anual and I share views about him, untrusting. Much is going on here, and in some way I believe it involves me. The creatures that have attacked us seem to be interested in killing me. I miss you all dearly and hope to visit soon, I send with this letter my love and affection to you all.                          With Love,                           Jubilee Rieka Amara

      Just finished up bible school at my church. I was the Recreation person, came up with the games and led the kids. Plus I typed up the songs they sang. It was fun, a lot of work, but fun. Now I have to finish the power point presentation for Sunday, scan in a bunch of pictures to show for Sunday, and pack for a road trip to Wisconsin to visit my Great Uncle Lyle and Maxine. Oy. Only mom and me......help me. But it will be fun, we’re stopping at a Wolf Park....with live wolves. :-) Then Sarah gets back after we get back from our road trip. She’s staying three weeks, then she’s off to France for a year! Oy. Then on the 24th school starts. Boooo! Though I have a week of half days so that will be good. Sunday Chris is running his D&D campaign I’m pretty sure, and I think Shane might be running his, I don’t know tho. So at least some D&amp;Ding Sunday. :-) Well after all that bible school I’m tired. So, bye....*runs off to bed tail swishing slowly*

      Yeah, well the our laptop refused to start today so we had to borrow Shane’s for the service today. Then there were a lot of mistakes in the presentation...woops. :-) Then after church we set up for Bible School, then I went to Shane’s and the group played D&D, which was fun, kinda confusing, but fun. Two player’s characters were killed, but hey. Oy. Um, and BS starts tomorrow night. *sigh* oy. So that’s about it. So I’ll put up my journal for D&amp;D if anyone wants to read that and....that’s it.....bye! *bounds off tail swishing*  Dearest Zeke, Mother, and Father, I miss you all dearly.  This adventure grows more unusual every moment. We were set upon by Ruin, the raven witch, she cast some sort of spell on us and sent us into a dream world. Luna was unknowingly in control of the dream in some ways. Three of our companions are no longer with us. One, Soleil, fell over the edge of the dream’s “world”and seemingly disappeared. When Luna heard of this, she began bawling and simultaneously a huge storm struck. While Kells and Cancain were attacked by shades while walking across town looking for the source of a loud howling noise, being changed into shades themselves. As the other members of my party searched for answers I tried on my new dress then rested. I was woken from my trance by a shout from Anual.  I briefly debated on going back to sleep but quickly dismissed the idea. The shades had begun attacking Dawn, Anual, and Luna. I joined the battle and was soon drained of much of my strength by none other than the Shades of Kells and Cancain. I can only guess as why they would attack me out of the group, but it proved a blessing since I was probably the only one who could have survived their attacks. We were soon joined by Glideron, the elf that had given Anual his magical sword. We managed to defeat all the shades besides those of Kells and Cancain. We ventured back to Anual’s house and tried more attempts to free ourselves from this precarious world. Eventually Anual and Dawn found the hidden evil in Luna and vanquished it, returning us to the normal world. But not before fifteen of Anual’s neighbors were taken as shades by the two turned evil allies and they, themselves, also killed. With our return I rested from the much loss of strength and studied more spells with the help of Patrick Kilplow. Our next missions soon came and we found ourselves again in the underground tunnels, this time with Dawn, Anual, myself, Luna, Bianca, formerly known as Dancia, and a merchant troop leader call Samuel Jackson.                            With Love,                        Jubilee Rieka Amara
