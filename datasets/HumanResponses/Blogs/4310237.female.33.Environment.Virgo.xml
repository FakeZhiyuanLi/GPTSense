      I work, I come home, I read, I sleep.  Something's gotta change, but for now I'm just treading water, keeping my head just far enough above the waves that I don't drown, waiting for them to recede so I can sort through the flotsam and jetsam on the beach.  Read "Songs of the Gorilla Nation -- my journey through autism" -- wow.  Taking Angela to the zoo after that was kind of painful, as I could see some of the animals were clearly not happy.  The puma stood with its face to a divot in the wall of its enclosure, which it had probably dug or chewed itself.  The woodland caribou did endless laps of one portion of their fence line, having worn a channel where they go back and forth, back and forth.  The tiger paced nervously, as far from the antagonistic crowd as possible.  I was ashamed of the behaviour of my fellow humans, as they yelled, clapped, whistled and pounded on glass to try and get the animals' attention.  Would you walk over and pose for a person who was acting that way towards you?  The black bear in disguise (it was white) seemed content to play in its caged habitat, but then it's still young.  Its mother had been hit by a car and it was brought to the zoo because it would not have survived on its own.  I imagine it will spend the rest of its life in captivity.  I'm glad that zoos like this mostly get their animals from rescue now, I hope the days of shooting entire gorilla families to capture the children are soon gone.  There were no gorillas at Assiniboine Zoo.  In a way I was disappointed, as I wanted to see what Dawn Prince-Hughes was talking about in her book (though I can see it so clearly anyway in my mind's eye).  But on the other hand I wouldn't want to see them in cages any more than I'd want to be in one.  The white tigers (main reason we went) were nice.  They're a traveling display, here til October, and I knew Angela would love them.  The big cats were my favourite too, though I wish the snow leopard would have come out while we were there, and the polar bear.  I wonder if we'll be able to keep a polar bear population alive after their habitat is gone?  Don't get me started.  The finch house at the Australian exhibit was nice, various pretty birds doing their thing behind glass.  I could have sat there and watched them for a while.  No wolverine, unfortunately.  I wonder where it went?  Ah, me.  I wish I could wave a magic wand and undo all the bad things in the world.  Getting rid of 90% of the human population ought to be a good start.

      February 2002 -- after I woke I drew a picture of the street scene, but I wasn't able to truly capture the image from my dream.  But first, I wrote this to get the whole thing down before it faded.   =================   I've just had the most amazing, vivid dream.  I was sitting on my mother's bed, looking at a poster that Mark had brought back from his travels.  It was a European city scene, with large fancy letters superimposed over it that looked to me as if they spelled "Madrid".  Suddenly, I found myself standing on a sidewalk, looking into a shop window that very closely resembled the poster in some way.  I realized that I had been transported somehow to a REAL European city, but I didn't know where.  I figured at first that it must be Madrid, considering the text on the poster, but I wasn't sure.  I started walking down the street, looking at the people around me and trying to identify the nationality of them and the buildings and artifacts I passed.  When I saw an ancient ruin that looked like a cross between the Coliseum and Stonehenge, at a circular intersection beyond which was a vivid green hill flanked with unfamiliar trees, I wished that I had brought my camera.  I went closer to get a good look at the ruin, which turned into a fountain by the time I reached it.  There was an Eastern-looking fellow reclining on the shapeless, flowing structure of the fountain, wearing flowing, colourful robes and a turban and looking for all the world like a prince or Rajah.  A small boy, similarly clothed, scampered around the fountain placing candles in small glass dishes strategically about the fountain.  It looked like preparation for some ritual or performance, but what I couldn't tell.  There were vendors of balloons, children's books and toys pushing carts around the square, so perhaps it was some sort of children's entertainment that was about to start.  I tried to seat myself at one of the tables placed about the square, but the ground there sloped downward so sharply that I couldn't keep my balance, so I moved on.    I walked back towards the window at which I had arrived, wondering how I would get back home.  I still hadn't found out where I was -- everyone around me, though seemingly dark, exotic and somehow Eastern -- Arabic or Indian -- seemed to be speaking English.  It didn't seem like Spain, anyway, from what I could tell.  I saw a gold purse with a chain lying on the sidewalk, people walking past it without a glance.  I picked it up, and found inside an address -- somewhere in America, I can't remember.  I remarked "Oh good, I'll know where to send it" and carried it with me.  As I was standing on a corner waiting to cross a street, a woman asked me if I was Canadian.  I said I LIVE in Canada, and she said she thought so.  I don't know how she had concluded that.  I reached a bridge that looked unfamiliar, so I was sure I'd passed the window where I had arrived.  I looked down over the edge of the bridge at house, probably an apartment building, with large, broad balconies covered with greenery.  I recalled how gardens and balconies were cherished by the people in this country (which I still couldn't identify, so I don't know how I could recall such a thing!).    I must have found my way back to the window somehow, because I was back home again.  I was describing the adventure to Mark, who said that the poster was his "unhappy" poster, or something to that effect.  A couple of brief interruptions of my sleep later, and we were both back in the same city.  I was telling him about all I had seen the first time, and wanting to show him the ruin and the background that had made it such an enticing picture -- suddenly realizing that I STILL didn't have my camera with me.  We passed a window, and Mark wondered aloud if Woolworth's would let him sit and read in their store.  I looked up, and sure enough, it was a Woolworth's.  I still didn't know where we were.  I pointed out to Mark that there were plenty of pleasant spots ahead, with benches that would be a nice place for him to read his book, so we continued on.  The ruin wasn't there, nor the fountain that had replaced it in my first adventure.  We did, however, find a park filled with many flowering trees.  Mark started telling me about how a friend of his -- I think it might actually have been Steve -- had told him how he used to go about jumping on total strangers in public, but in such a fashion that he didn't get beaten up, which he thought was a really strange thing to want to do.  I thought so, too, and wasn't sure what the connection was between this odd story and the flowering trees that Mark was pointing out all around us, though there seemed to be some connection in his mind.    In a flash, it seemed as if we had been there for some time -- days, at least, and there were others with us who had also made the journey, which seemed to make sense at the time though they hadn't been with us on the walk I just described.  There was Mark's girlfriend, a black-haired, exotic looking woman who doesn't remind me of anyone I know, two other young women and a young man, who seemed to me somehow to be college students.  One of the young women was telling us that when she had asked for Gummi Worms at the candy store, the lady had understood what she meant, even though she was speaking in English.  I asked if anyone had figured out where we were, thinking at first that it might be Switzerland for some reason -- maybe because some Swiss speak German, and would have understood "Gummi Worm" because they came from Swizerland or Germany or some relatively German-speaking place.  I was just checking out the writing on the package of the Gummi Worm that she had given me, to see what language it seemed to be in, when the other fellow said we were in Poland.    As I ate my Gummi Worm, one of the yellow and red striped ones covered with sugar crystals, I could actually taste it, which is unusual in dreams.  It was somewhat tart, like a Sour Patch Kid.  I watched as a man up the street picked up a small boat which was labeled as a hydrology research unit, lifting it easily out of the well of a cellar staircase full of water in which it had been "parked".  I thought to ask if he needed help, but figured that if I startled him by calling out, he might drop the boat.  I was pondering our whole situation, wondering if it was like Narnia, where no matter how much time we spent there, no time would have passed back home.  I rather liked the idea, as it was a very pleasant place to be and I would have enjoyed staying there for some time.  Then I woke up.

      I've been paying particular attention to my dreams lately, looking for relevance to my life, possible messages, spirit guides, and the like.  Since returning from my mother's farm where I went to help fix the house for three months, I've had a lot of "family responsibility" dreams, and also dreams where my mother and I fight over some issue.  I've been urged to consider the possibility that every person in my dream might represent a part of myself -- my mother might not be my mother, per se, but an aspect of my own psyche.  One such dream about a month or so ago had me crossing a large bridge with my mother -- or trying to cross it.  I had been walking along a high riverbank with my mother, noticing that the river was choked with grass clippings, as if all of the parks had emptied their lawnmower bags into it at once.  We came to the bridge, which was on a very busy street full of cars.  The right-hand pedestrian path had gaping holes in it, too large to jump across, so we crossed the street to take the other side.  Access to this walkway was partially blocked by the branch of a nearby tree, which had grown down over the edge of the path.  I remember thinking that it ought to be pruned back a bit.  The walkway itself was extremely shaky, a wooden frame attached to the bridge only by a series of bolts, which were not tightened, so that the walkway hung askew and shook with the vibrations of passing cars.   I was terrified to step onto it, and once I did, I wanted to cross it as quickly as possible.  My mother told me to lean out and look over the edge, that there was a flag on a house down below that I should see.  I did NOT want to lean out over the edge, since the walkway was slanting at such a sharp angle that I felt sure I would fall off.  I was holding onto the edge of the bridge for dear life, fearing for my fingers as the cars went speeding past inches away, but absolutely terrified that if I let go I would fall.  Mom was saying "Don't worry, it's perfectly safe", all the while deliberately shaking the walkway on its loose bolts to show me how "safe" it was.  She kept yelling at me to just lean over and look, and I kept screaming and crying that I just wanted to GO, to get to the other side in one piece before the walkway fell off or I fell off of it.   I woke up and experienced the worst episode of sleep paralysis I've had for a long while, where I could not move a muscle, only lay there for a minute or so until it passed.  ==========  I talked with my mother later about some of these dreams where she's screaming at me about something, and she told me something her friend and former pastor said to her -- when you dream about someone, at least entertain the idea that the person might represent a part of YOU, rather than them.  I have to ask myself -- what am I trying to show myself, what am I afraid to look at, and why?

      Kelpie Dream -- winter 1999 or spring 2000?   It all began in the water.  I floated on the waves, bobbing among a varied collection of hand drums.  Around me bobbed and swam other people, some picking up drums as they floated by and joining in the low, undulating rhythm that I could hear throbbing all around me.  I took up the next drum that came my way, entered the circle of sound briefly, and then sent it on its way again.  As I let go the drum, I felt a tug on my ankles, and saw a figure swim by underwater, peering up at me with a face too clouded to be able to interpret the expression, but which nevertheless struck a chill up my spine.  I realised suddenly that all the people around me were strangers, none of them from the group of people with whom I had come to this place, and that there was a subtle but very present feeling of malice in the air.  At that moment, I felt the undercurrent begin to pull me away from the shore.  I immediately swam against it, and quickly overcame the outward pull enough to reach the shore.  It was then that I saw my group heading just over the edge of the farthest visible dune and out of sight.  I snatched up my hipsack where it lay on the edge of the sandy beach, and ran after them.    I caught up with them just as they reached the boats in which we’d arrived, where we all discovered that most of them had been sabotaged, with large holes torn in their sides.  The only two that were still seaworthy were already full, and several of us were left stranded on the beach.  As we trudged back into the centre of the small island, the other group appeared around us.  The feeling of malice in the air increased.  I noticed the setting sun at approximately the same moment that I realised what would happen when it set.  They were waiting until then to eat us - me, actually.  I don’t know what had happened to the other stranded members of my group, but I found myself suddenly alone, surrounded by these strangers full of evil intent.  Suddenly, a small, shaggy, dark-haired boy darted from the crowd of strangers gathering around me, and attached himself to my leg like a mopheaded leech.  He released me after only a moment’s painful sucking, and grinned maliciously up at me with sharp teeth stained red.  I picked him up and threw him forcefully away from me.  “I got me a taste,” the urchin leered as he skipped slyly back into his place, under a disapproving but rather indulgent glare from the individual I identified as the leader of the group.  He glanced at the sun, just beginning to lose its shape behind the horizon, and with a decisive rub of his hands, began to speak and move towards me.   “Well…”   I didn’t wait to hear more -- thought, decision and action were all one at that moment.  I took three steps and dove straight out into the dark water, where I could sense something unspeakably horrible lurking… somewhere.  Still, facing the unknown horror in the water seemed less foolish than staying to be eaten alive by the kelpies, so I dove.  As my hands above my head hit the surface, I woke.  For the longest brief moment I lay seized in the grip of sleep paralysis, before I began to tremble and weep.  Courtney woke and comforted me, assuring me that he would never let the kelpies eat me, but it was then I realised that he hadn’t been in the dream at all, not even a thought or memory of him - the “me” in the dream didn’t know any Courtney Welch.   -----   The things that strike me as most significant about this dream are the details regarding acting on my own behalf.  Normally in dreams I suffer from extreme physical lassitude whenever strength or speed are required, especially when trying to defend myself from or escape danger.  Any decisive movement on my own behalf is like trying to swim uphill through molasses.  I am also usually unable to get myself organised enough to do whatever it is that needs to be done, especially if I am late getting somewhere.  I can never seem to “get my shit together” enough to just GO.  I frequently can’t see, as if the lights are too dim no matter how many I turn on, and my teeth often crumble to pieces in my mouth.  Whenever the “bad thing” in a dream touches me, I am seized by a clench of the spine that sends chills racking through my body and arches my back with exquisite agony.    What makes this dream remarkable is the extent to which I was able to act on my own behalf - swimming against the undertow, finding and picking up my hipsack, catching up to my group, throwing off the boy, and diving into the water.  The amount of decisiveness I exhibited amazes me, as I am frequently not only helpless, but also humiliated in my dreams.  I am often finding myself naked in public, in compromising situations with people I don’t particularly like, or responsible for something that I have neglected or which is suddenly going terribly, terribly wrong.  This dream encompasses more decisive, positive action on my own behalf than ALL of my dreams put together, that I can recall.  Even recalling it months later, I am overwhelmed by the feelings it evokes in me.  I will hold onto this feeling of positive decisiveness, for when I need it in real life.

      I know you're going to think that's the cheesiest name in the world, but when required to come up with a name, and thinking of things to do with "Nightfall", this is what leapt to mind.  So there.  Not terribly original, but nonetheless appropriate.  I don't really know why I'm starting a blog except that I've kind of burned out on writing in forums, yet I still want to communicate somehow.  So, here I am.  Until I figure out what I want to write in here, I'll probably just post some poems and dreams and such for starters.  Give those of you who don't know me yet a glimpse into my head, so you can decide if you want to stick around for more.  ;-)  Um, so there.
