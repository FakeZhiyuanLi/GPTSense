             Eversince India launched its first satellite Aryabhatta long back in 1975, India jumped into the Space race. Since then India have launched 35+ satellites in space. Some of the recent satellites are successfully launched by indeginous launcher rockets. It is really a great achievement. Now India is thinking of launching a Space Probe towards Moon called Chandrayan. This is even more significant as our nearest rival china have already launched an indeginously built space vehicle with a chinese astronaut onboard. India have a history of Indian man in space. First it was Rakesh Sharma sent aboard Salyut a then Soviet Union Space craft. I still remember him talking with Mrs. Indira Gandhi about how India looks from outer space as "Saare jahan se achcha, Hindustan hamara." Later it was Kalpana Chawala who worked with NASA to traverse the space in Space shuttle, who sadly perished in Columbia mishap. 	India with a population of more than one billion have even lot more Rakesh Sharma's and Kalapna Chawala's waiting to get a chance aboard some spaceship to show their talent. Alas! The huge corruption level in India stops them from coming up. But a true determination to go throughis required to surface in this corrupt environment. The education system must be revamped to make room for creativity than just passing out some exam and getting some degree, just to search for a job. The unemployment problem compells people to sacrifice their talent and look for job oriented degrees. Only those with good money backup can persue higher degrees and research. This is the main reason why India cannot built its own Cryogenic engine, modern aircrafts, for which we are still at the mercy of foreign nations. It is also one of the reasons for falling of Migs, so callled flying coffins every now and then. When we will come out of this situation? 	Now a days there is debate going around about India's Moon mission. Is it necessary? Does India really need to spend crores of rupees on such a fruitless mission? What common people of India will get out of it? Just a name added in the list of Countries who sent a Space probe to the Moon? There are both sides to this coin. You can successfully debate on its plus points as well as minus. But the plus points are long term and are not apparent directly. It should be remembered that most of the inventions of 20th century are not individual ones. It is the result of a group efforts. Inventions like Computers, Television, Satellite communication etc. not done by any individual entity. Most of these inventions are side effects of Space and Military Research and Development. Even the internet was developed first as a requirement by American Army, which then spread world over. The money spent in these apparently fruitless research pays back in long term. For example if India proves itself a reliable and cheap Space craft launching facility, a lot of customers are waiting their to hire our launchers to launch their satellites and space probes, which can worth billions of dollars of forein currency revenue for India. 	So it is time for India to be on top of the world. What it needs to do is control its population, improve the education system and irradicate corruption. If these three basic facts are kept under control, all other factors will automatically improve and no one in the world can stop us from achieving our targets. I hope you all agree with me.

      	For unknown ages after the explosive outpouring of matter and energy of the Big Bang, the Cosmos was without form. There were no galaxies, no Planets, no Life. Deep, impentrable darkness was everywhere, Hydrogen atoms in the void. Here and there denser accumulation of gas were imperceptibly growing, globes of matter were condensing - Hydrogen raindrops more massive than suns. A first generation of star was born, flooding the Cosmos with light. There were in those times not yet any planets to receive the lights, no living creature to admire the radiance of the heavens. Deep in the stellar furnaces the alchemy of nuclear fusion created heavy elements, the ashes of Hydrogen burning, the atomic building materials of future planets and Life-forms. Massive stars soon exhausted their stores of nuclear fuel Rocked by colossal explosions, they returned most of their sub stance back into the thin gas from which they had once condensed Here in the dark lush clouds between the stars, new raindrops made of many elements were forming, later generations of stars being born. Nearby, smaller raindrops grew, bodies far too little to ignite the nuclear fire, droplets in the interstellar mist on their way to form the planets. Among them was a small world of stone and iron, the early Earth. 	Congealing and warming, the Earth released the methane, ammonia, water and hydrogen gases that had been trapped within forming the primitive atmosphere and the first oceans. Starlight from the Sun bathed and warmed the primeval Earth, drove storms generated lightning and thunder. Volcanoes overflowed with lava These processes disrupted molecules of the primitive atmosphere the fragments fell back together again into more and more complex forms, which dissolved in the early oceans. After a time the seas achieved the consistency of a warm, dilute soup. Molecules were organized, and complex chemical reactions driven, on the surface of clays. And one day a molecule arose that quite by accident was able to make crude copies of itself out of the other molecules in the broth. As time passed, more elaborate and more accurate self-replicating molecules arose. Those combinations best suited to further replication were favored by the sieve of natural selection. Those that copied better produced more copies. And the primitive oceanic broth gradually grew thin as it was consumed by and transformed into complex condensations of self-replicating organic molecules. Gradually, imperceptibly, life had begun. 	Single celled plants evolved, and life began to generate its own food. Photosynthesis transformed the atmosphere. Sex was invented. Once free living forms banded together to make a complex cell with specialized functions. Chemical receptors evolved, and the Cosmos could taste and smell. One celled organisms evolved into multicellular colonies, elaborating their various parts into specialized organ systems. Eyes and ears evolved, and now the Cosmos could see and hear. Plants and animals discovered that the land could support life. Organisms buzzed, crawled, scuttled, lumbered, glided, flapped, shimmied, climbed and soared. Colossal beasts thundered through the steaming jungles. Small creatures emerged, born live instead of in hard-shelled containers, with a fluid like the early oceans coursing through their veins. They survived by swiftness and cunning. And then, only a moment ago, some small aboreal animals scampered  down from trees. They became upright and taught themselves the use of tools, domesticated other animals, plants and fire, and devised language. The ash of stellar alchemy was now emerging into consciousness. At an ever accelerating pace, it invented writing, cities, art and science, and sent spaceships to the planets and stars. These are some of the things that Hydrogen atoms do, given fifteen billion years of cosmic evolution.

               The MIG's have been backbone of Indian Air Force since long time. Their performance is well proved in four wars we fought with Pakistan. But today the fleet is ageing. The manufacturer of the aircraft i.e. Soviet Union no longer exists. During the regime of Soviet union, they had extensive manufacturing and research facilities to develop the MIG series of fighters. But eversince disintegration of Soviet Union these facilities are their but have degraded a lot in their quality. Present Russian government can't afford to secure enough funds for upkeep of these facilities. The result is clear. We get defective spare parts from Russia, which is the main reason why these planes are coming down day by day. 	So many years have passed by after our independence from British, but India is still in its infancy for Aircraft technology. Our own indeginous fighter is still to be come out of the development process. Other projects like Advanced Light Helicopter and Arjun Main Battle Tank are also not complete. We still rely on western countries for critical parts of these warmachines like their engines. I don't understand India with a population of more than one billion talented people can't develop its own war machines? 	After second world war world is divided into two parts, pro-americans and pro-soviets. India was offered a deal by both U.S. and Soviets. U.S. wanted India to allow land its troops on Indian soil and give them a permanent base. But India was reluctant to lose its sovereignity and become a pet nation of a superpower. So India opted for Soviet Union which did not put any such condition. So then U.S. turned to Pakistan and India was backed by Soviet Union. Thus Soviet Union became major arms supplier to India. Here India lost the battle since U.S. is far superior in terms of military equipment than Soviet Union. So if India had struck the deal with U.S., F16's would have been our backbone force rather than the MIG's. Also U.S. would not have supported Pakistan due to which it dared to fight against us in 1965 and 1972. 	History can't be altered but future can be. India must built special Institutions and R&D facilities to develop its own military arsenals. India must hunt down talented people from its large human resource and employ them in such institutions to develop 100% indeginous military equipments. This will not only reduce dependence of India on developed countries for these equipments but also save a lot of foreign exchange. We can also sell these equipments to other countries and earn foreign exchange for our country. If we are strong in military power, no neighbouring country will ever dare to start any war against us. Developed countries will also respect our presence in world community and soften their stands on various economic issues like GATT.
