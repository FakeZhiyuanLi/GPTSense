      My name is Lara. Whoever you are, whether family, friends or strangers I bid you hello. What this blog is to me is a space to run away and free myself. To gather my thoughts, to create, unwind and run my fingers through my brain. If you wish to look, be my guest. Not everything here will make sense to you and some may find it offensive or self-indulgent at times. Welcome and step into my Shadow of the Moon.

      I found a path on which not to tread so lightly. A path which screams to run wild upon. It beckons me to live freely and seldom look back. In what ways will it taunt me? In what ways will I indulge? Along it's rocky bottom I feel my lifeforce spreading thin. A million pebbles I wish to look more closely at. When I try to hold them they slip through my fingers and pass from view as I quicken my pace. Behind me they find their way into the shadow of the moon, escaping though and memory. The shadow at times creates illusions and seperates me from my focus. I bend and sway inside it's darkness where question easly leads to a mild insanity. Near the edge of this path winds a river in which I float my doubts. In the shadow, on the edge I lose my footing and find myself tip toeing in and out of the water. I strive to cleanse myself and dive in head first. No matter how long I swim I cannot see another shore. Backwards now, I float from whence I came. The waves crash violently and I find that freedom comes with a price. Dripping wet I crawl back onto the shore heading for my dusty road. The moon seems brighter now and in the distance I can see the gods in all their glory. Each presenting fate and fortune it's own unique way. The goddesses creating a labryinth in which to encourage self reliance and unleash hidden wisdom. Onto another stepping stone I glance across the river. I see the waves have died down, but still don't see another shore. Kneeling down I feel the ground on which I shall continue to tread. I sift through it's layers and intoxicate myself with it's scent.  My earthly devotions catch fire as I breathe the flame from my soul. Running wildly I begin to explode. Bits and pieces of me hit the wind and are cast into dust behind me, settling upon the path. The wind whips without intent nor does it bear concern. It forces the clouds across the sky moving ever closer towards the moon. The clouds finally reach the face of her majesty. At once her shadow is dissolved forcing a torrent of tears to push through the clouds raining onto the dirt at my feet. Through the mud I still must travel. One foot infront of the other making my way. Which way- Which way-
