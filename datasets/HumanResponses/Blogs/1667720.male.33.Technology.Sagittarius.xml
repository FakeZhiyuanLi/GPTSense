       Newbie Be Warned   Some bloggers are just plain mean. Witness this reaction to people asking for help:   You can see the latter on the axis user mail list, where users complain that they are getting a 'connection refused' error, AxisFault 'HttpResponse:404' or 'ClassNotFoundException'and can somebody please help them. These people should not be helped. There is an informal mountaineering rule that you never help incompetents up a mountain to killed higher up, only down, to get out alive.  --  urlLink Steve Loughran    The previous quote was from a very informative blog entry:  urlLink Sam Ruby: Bruce Eckel said SOAP sucks?

        urlLink The Importance of Base Training for Cyclists  makes some really good points I should take to heart.    The most important phase of our training is the base period. For most cyclists, since we plan to peak in the spring or summer, fall is traditionally the time when we focus on endurance/base-building rides. Also known as LSD (long, slow distance), these rides are high in volume (time), but low in intensity (heart rate). This can be a challenge on the road, because an endurance pace for most riders is pretty darn slow and doesn&rsquo;t allow for much climbing (a challenge in choosing routes here in Northern California). It&rsquo;s just so tempting to hammer, catch a rabbit on the road, or join in a fast-paced group ride. But to truly build base, it&rsquo;s necessary to be extremely disciplined and spend most of our time on the bike at a lower (read slower) intensity.

      I just read an  urlLink article  on edurance swim training and it got me thinking about how much time I'm spending in the pool and what I'm doing while I'm there. I think I'm going to increase my distance per workout. Sure wish I had numbers from my previous workouts to know just how much I should/can increase. The article also made it clear that if I want to go farther, I might want visit the pool more often. I'm training for a November tri with a  really  short swim of 500 meters and I don't think I could cover that distance today. Pretty sad, really. Well, nothing that a little hard work can't fix.

      Things are looking good for the  urlLink wharf-to-wharf  10k in July. I’ve been diligent in my training and expect to be able to finish the race. This is no small feat considering the shape I was in 6 months ago. My 5 am run felt real good and I think my new fueling scheme is working. During this morning's run I ran with much more energy than usual. I ran just under 6 miles and my split times support my theory.    12:00  12:05  12:40  9:57  9:07  9:51    BTW, the slower split times were taken when I was running with my training partner. He's just getting started and is doing great considering he's been at it for 2 weeks.

      In case you were wondering just what the heck an anorak is, let alone a tri-anorak, here's what the  urlLink wikiperdia  says:   In British slang, anorak has come to mean "geek" or "nerd", originally from their use as the invariable wear of train spotters, and then by extension to refer to anyone with an unfathomable interest in detailed information regarded as boring by the rest of the population - aided by the intuition that only a geek would wear something so terminally unfashionable.

      After having a fantastic run yesterday, I was really looking forward to a repeat performance this morning. Unfortunately, it never happened. First of all, I attributed yesterday's successful run to proper fueling. Instead of my usual carb intake of ~20 grams (can you atkins?), I increased my intake by a factor of 2 thinking the extra carbs would likely not kick me out of  urlLink ketosis  and would probably aid my speed work. Based on my split times and how I felt during the run, I think my theory was right. So what went wrong?   This morning as I prepared for my morning run I started scavaging around the kitchen looking for a good source of carbs. Unfortunately the  urlLink nutrition fairy  has not come around lately and all I found to eat was a urlLink  lean cuisine lasagna . apparently this is not the perfect food to consume 20 mins before a run. It just sat there in the bottom of my stomach like so kind of pasta brick. Ug.      I think I'm gonna buy some  urlLink Cytomax  before this happens again.

      For a while now I have been avoiding having to work on my core, but the other day I observed something that may get me doing crunches. While I was running I noticed how much work my body was doing just keeping my upper torso errect. By the end of my run (1hr 30min) my core was pretty pooped. I've also observed core fatigue during my swim program spcifically when I'm working on my kick. Not sure how/when to work in some  urlLink core development  but my guess is that it will help my performance.    urlLink    I think my  urlLink Tensor Fascia Latae  might be to blame. It burns like the dickens when I bike. &nbsp; urlLink

      Here's what my training week looks like so far:    T : Run, Swim  W:  Run, Swim, Bike   Thur : Run,Swim   Fri : Rest    The triple I pulled on Wednesday really tuckered me out and I paid for it Thursday morning. Luckily, both the run and swim were done in the evening so I had some time to recover. Never the less, the 1.5 hr 1500 meter swim program was hard to do immediately after the 1 hour run. Ouch. Thank goodness it's Friday.   BTW, Martin and I are hoping to increase our swim program to 2000 meters in a week or so. Not sure if this is sane but it sounds like a fun challenge. I'm getting more comfortable in the water and my breathing is improving. I don't  forget  exhale as much.   Oh, and I almost forgot. Meet my new best friend, the pull float.

      Which hearth rate calculation method is more appropriate?   There are two methods:  1 ) A range based on zero (dead) to your max HR.  2 ) A range based resting HR to max HR. The second was named the " urlLink Karvonen " method. It creates narrower ranges and is (supposedly?) preferred by endurance coaches.  Also there is some “logic” behind Kervonen Method. Since you are never going to have a HR below your resting HR, subtract resting HR from max HR. The HR reserve (=MHR-RHR) is the "working" HR span and HR will always fall within the HR reserve, no matter how hard or easy you go. It makes sense, then, to take percentages of HR reserve when gauging intensity. Does it?  Don’t get me started about determination of max HR for each type of exercise! ;-)

      I’m 33 years old and live on the central coast of California with my wife Julia, our two cats and a Bulldog named Mac. My wife and I are recovering fatties. Yep. Fat. One day (2-2-2004) we decided to get into shape. At that point I weighed 219 lbs, which is a lot considering that I’m 5’8’’.   After spending several weeks fixing our diet, we joined our local athletic club.  At that time my workouts consisted of ~20 minutes on an  urlLink elliptical machine . I continued to visit the gym ~3 times a week and after several weeks, I was doing 45+ minute workouts and feeling better than I had in a long time. After about a month a friend ( urlLink Martin ) invited me to play racquetball and thus began many weeks of running around in a white box sweating profusely. Loads of fun. :-)   After a couple months of exercising, I was happy with the progress I was making and I was certainly feeling better. At this point I had lost somewhere in excess of 15 lbs and my old cloths were starting to fit. I decided to step up the demand I was placing on my body so I began running. The more I ran the more weight I lost and the better I felt. So far, so good.   Somewhere around the 40 lbs mark I heard about sprint distance triathlons.  More to come.

      Not sure if it was the cytomax or something I ate the night before but half way into mile 4, I suddenly felt sharp pains in my chest. Yikes! I immediately stopped running and just as quickly as the pain started, it stopped. Strange, no? Wondering what a heart attack would feel like and thinking about  urlLink Jim Fixx  and  urlLink Douglas Adams , I walked a stretch. Having regained my composure, I started running again and lo and behold, the pain came back. It seems that bouncing was inducing the problem.   Still don't know what was causing the pain but I'm guessing gas.      [Listening to: Intermission -  urlLink Combustible Edison  - I, Swinger (3:56)]

      Had a good 1hr 15min session in the pool today. Basically did  some-large-number@100  yrds. I did probably half of them with my friend the pull buoy and half with no help. Not sure if I can do the race distance (440 yrds) unaided and without stopping yet. Using the pull buoy, I have no problem. Oddly, using the pull buoy feels a lot like swimming with a wet suit on which I will be doing in the race. It seems strange that a sport known for being so athletically challenging would allow wet suits to begin with. Don't get me wrong, I'm real happy with the way things are. ;-)   I'm gonna ask Martin if we can add more distance using the pull buoy. Makes me feel macho doing lap after lap after lap without stopping.   Hey, Martin! Get well! I need you at the pool.

       urlLink Martin  turned me on to  urlLink Marc Evans ' training methodology and I've decided to reworking my training zones to follow the the approach described in  urlLink Triathlete's Edge .  These numbers only represent training zones for running. I've not tested my Max Heart Rate (MHR) for the other disciplines. To get my MHR I ran a warmup followed by a short sprint, followed by a recovery jog and yet another sprint. I should have paid more attention to the time spent sprinting and recovering as I'm not sure I pushed myself long enough. I also think I might have ran too fast; my lungs might have given out before my heart reached its max. I plan to do this test a couple more times in order to get more accurate numbers.      Target heart-rate  =  % intensity  *  heart-rate reserve  +  resting heart-rate     Resting HR : 50  Running Max : 180  HR reserve : 130      02  LVT-a  LVT-b  LVT-c  VO2  LAC     70%  75%  80%  92%  95%  98%     141  148  154  170  174  178      LVT-b(80%) is considered " urlLink Lactate Threshold " beyond which lie  urlLink much wailing and gnashing of teeth .

      I started the day with a 1 hour ride out to my new training grounds; an area of hills and mountains between Salinas and San Jaun Bautista. Unfortunately, I missed my turn and instead of going for a hill climb (4-6%) on San Jaun Grade, I spent my time spinning over the rollers of old stage road. I guess I really could have turned around and headed for the hills once I realized I missed my turn but I didn't.   Then, this evening I did my swim workout without my training partner. I did somewhere in the neighborhood of 1200 yards but didn't keep track of my distance. My intention was to do 2000 with sets of 300 yards but I didn't.   Having failed to achieve all of my training goals for the day, I'm sitting here trying to figure what went wrong. A little training retrospective, if you will. Here's my conclusion:    1]  Self deception is the real enemy, not failure.  2]  Have a plan and a purpose for each workout.  3]  Plans are meant to be broken, but only after much reflection.    You don't have to plan to fail; all you have to do is fail to plan.    How do you deal with failures? How diligently do you plan?

      I accomplished my 10 mile long run! Yesterday, immediately after checking into the hotel, I pulled on my running shoes and set out for the prisideo. I won’t cover the details of the run but there a couple of things that stand out.   1] Chafing suck! Even a little. 2] To avoid becoming freakishly tired after 90 minutes of running, be sure to fuel up properly. I think I consumed all of 300/400 calories the morning before my run and I likely burnt most of that during my 1.5 hour swim workout.  3] I really do need to move to San Francisco. The place has it all: Art, culture, technology, scenic beauty, and some great bars.  That’s all for now. Gotta get back to the conference.

      I need to work more bike time into my schedule. Not really sure where the time will come from but I'm thinking of buying a  urlLink  trainer  and sneaking in 1 hour blocks of spinning. I'm hoping to build up some cycling  urlLink proprioception .

      Yet another  urlLink toy  I want. There's also the german made  urlLink SRM  system but it's way too pricy. Hate to think I'm chasing performance gadgets but at the end of the day, triathlon is still cheaper than golf.

      I had some real sore legs after a trip to the gym. I could barely make it down a flight of stairs the next morning. Yikes. I'm sure this was just a case of  urlLink DOMS  but I've also been having some pain in my hips. I suspect that my entire core (glutes,lower back, etc.) are tight but I'm not sure how to diagnose this. I've done some stretching and plan to incorporate regular stretching or yoga into my schedule. If that fails, I'm gonna try screaming "Out Satan!" at my ass. Could work. ;-)

       Swim : 5,000 yards  Bike :  60 miles  Run :  6.2 miles   Retrospective    My swimming sessions are slowly improving with this week marking the first time I've found my groove in the water. Finally I was able to covered more than 600 yards without stopping and never felt like I was going anaerobic. In fact, I felt like I could swim for a very long time.   My main swim set has consisted of doing 5X(100 @ 2:00) with 60 seconds rest. These intervals are challenging for me but I seem to be adapting to the stress. I tend to finish the intervals around 1:35 wich gives me a 85 second rest. Not sure how to go slower and I really need all that time to recover. I plan to increase the number invervals in the weeks to come.   On the bike things have been going well except for an unfortunate mechanical mishap I suffered on Saturday's hill climb. Having failed to check my tire pressure (I did not own a gauge or a pump at the time), I climbed San Juan Grade with tires filled with ~40 PSI instead of the 110 that should have been in them. The ride was very challenging and I assumed it was so due to my poor fitness. It was not until Sunday afternoon that I checked my tire pressure and realized the true source of my struggle up the hill.    My running suffered the most this week due to improper planning and fatigue. I went on an impromptu trip to Santa Cruz w/ Julie and failed to get my Friday run in. Thursday's run was canceled due to the effects of Wednesday's 1.5 hour session on the trainer.  Sunday's long run was replaced w/ a 10k @ race pace.   My overall health is good but I have some tightness in my back and a minor ache in the groin. Both of these  ailments occurred after Sunday's run   Lessons Learned   Check your tire pressure before every ride! Give the body time to adapt. This takes time and trust.

      This week is not starting the best. Same as Rob, I have day off on Monday and Tuesday. However, I peddled on my trainer for 20 minutes yesterday to warm me up for the week and stay with an advice from Marc Evans to do at least light exercise on off days. Today morning I was supposed to get up at 4.30am and run my 3 miles&nbsp;with intervals. But guess what, I couldn’t sleep all night, did not hear the alarm, and woke up feeling fatigue just in time to go to work.  &nbsp;  After work I tried to meet Rob for a swim.&nbsp; Pool was full of children horsing around and no space for “triathlete” to practice.&nbsp; I was too tired to argue with management about the proper use of swimming pool. (“swimming” being the important word here.) So, I returned home and went for a half hour run.&nbsp; Run was little bit more difficult than usually as I tried to practice higher stride. Other than that it was a good run (of course I’m not counting that my iPod refused to play for the second 15 minutes of the run).  &nbsp;  I hope this is not an indication how the rest of my week will look like.

      After borrowing Rob’s trainer for week or so, I finally bought my own trainer. I went to urlLink  Supergo Bike Store  (by the way, great store) and I got a  urlLink Blackburn Trackstand Fluid Trainer .&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;   urlLink     Blackburn Trainer&nbsp; urlLink      This trainer is not as smooth as Rob’s Cycle-Ops Fluid II, but with 30% discount, it is a great buy. With that, I also ordered a  urlLink Cateye CD300WD  cycle-computer from  urlLink Lickbike.com .&nbsp;This will allow me to track my cadence, speed, and distance even if using a trainer. Plus I like the wireless feature.

      Sunday, I (martin)spend 4 hours with a professional triathlon coach  urlLink Marc Evans  (check out his two book  urlLink here  &amp;  urlLink here ). It was a quite eye-opening experience. During these sessions Marc goes through your flexibility, core strength, running technique, bicycle setting, peddling technique, and swimming technique. All of which gets recorded on tape prior and after his technique adjustments (in my case it was very painful to watch :-) ).   The session started good, he checked my flexibility, which was without any problems, and we moved on. Core strength was surprisingly very good and again we moved on. (Note, every time we moved on it saved me about $100 ;-) )   Running - my weakest discipline. The biggest surprise. Marc discovered that together with my overall flat feet my left food collapses inward with every step, which creates additional stress on my knees and pelvis. After viewing a video of my run I could see my pelvis and shoulders tilting to left side. Marc recommended getting an orthopedic evaluation and inserts for my shoes to avoid any future injuries and further deterioration of my posture. It turns out that this mechanical disorder was the main cause of my knee injury one month after I started running and it causes the shin splints pain in my left leg after every longer run I do. Other than that my stride is a problem. I run with approx. 65 steps per minute compared with 90-95, which is optimal. Marc showed me a series of exercises to do with every run to improve it. With higher stride I feel that my running is smoother and I don’t waist lot of energy going up and down. The trade off is higher HR. Will see how quickly I can adjust to it.   Bicycle. Since I’ve purchased  urlLink my bicycle  I did not feel comfortable on it. I had to replace my seat and I spend lot of time playing with seat post and handlebars to improve it. Needless to say I had very little success. Marc spent some time running around me with different measuring gadgets while looking on computer showing the torque powers of my peddling. The result was adjustments to my seat post (1-2 in up), handlebars (2in lower), and few minor changes to my aerobars. Seems to work as I feel more comfortable and the torque powers improved. Cadence was also a focus of the session. I’m comfortable in around 85 rpm, when I should really be around 95-100 rpm. Marc showed some exercises to work on it and create the necessary muscle memory.   Swimming. We went to a flume (how fun is that !!) where Marc made a video of my technique. Per Marc I don’t really need to concentrate on swimming (I would hope so after years of competitive swimming :-) ) and we moved on.   Last hour and half we spent talking about nutrition, training, periodisation, intensity zones, and all the other stuff. We did not talk about specific training plan since that would different session and different fee :-). When I sort all of the information in my head I’ll blog little bit more. For now, I have couple sentences in my memory – base building, base building, base building, and one more base building. Also, “technique before intensity”; "higher frequency and lower intesity for base building"; perceived exhaustion is better indicator of intensity zones than HR, and the most important “always have fun with it”.   I’ll definitely return to Marc after another 4-6 months to make additional correction to my technique and sing up for his training program. Right now, I have plenty of stuff to work on, loose more weight, and build more base.   --Martin

        I just started reading Bob Roll's book on the TdF. He points out that since American's have started riding in it, they've accounted for 1% of the riders, and 45% of the victories. (Not exact numbers, but something like that.) To me, this is a perfect example of the American character. Completely pragmatic. The goal is to win the Tour: We are going to do what it takes to reach that goal. We are going to go about it scientifically. We don't care about tradition. We care about achieving that goal. And that's what we do.   -- urlLink vitus979   Like many triathletes, I've been watching US Postal's performance in the tour and find it awe-inspiring but I'm not sure that the US Postal teams approach is necessarily "American", but it is indisputably the most effective.

       Swim : 8,000 yards  Bike :  75 miles  Run :  10.25 miles  Felt good this week. Made the most progress in the swim. Intervals are getting easier and I can swim slow-and-steady without sinking. Biggest issue is not knowing how much to eat and drink. I'm taking in ~2,000 kcal daily and this may not be enough.

      Went out with Maverick and Martin to  urlLink Fort Ord . I had a great time. The weather was ass but the roads were smooth with no traffic; much better than the roads I've been training on.  Mavrick is doing a brick today (4 hr bike, and 30 min run) but I'm ready for that maddness just yet. If I recover from today's ride quickly and without insident, I'll do the brick with him next week. Sure is nice to know someone that's done this stuff before.  Oh, to be honest, the ride was really more like 48 miles and some change.

       Swim : 8,500 yards (4.8 miles)  Bike : 76 miles  Run : 27.5 miles  This week saw two 10 mile runs and a 48 mile bike ride. Missing was a long swim and some running speed work.   As for the 4th event, my weight is hovering around 177 with 18% of that being fat. I'd like to get down to 160 (~8% body fat) but I've not set a target date yet. Realistically, I think I can drop to 173 lbs. in time for the PG Tri (6 weeks).
