      Sorry for not writing yesterday. Yesterday kinda sucked. I didn't really do anything all day. I talked on the phone and online pretty much all day. My mom and I went looking for a house. She wants to buy a new house on the west side. We looked at this one that was really nice, but she said no. It was down a gravel road, back in the sticks. We didn't even get cell phone reception, and there is no way I could live without my cell, as most of you know. Carrie called and asked if I could run to the mall with her. She had to find something for her friend's birthday. The stuff she got was really cute. I don't remember what it was, but it was cute. Carrie and I went to Chris's house for a while. He told us while we were driving that his dad died. It was really sad. He seemed to be taking it well though, which is good. Well enough about yesterday. Let's move on to today. I got up around 11 this morning. I talked to Josh for a while and then I started getting ready for my interview at the buckle. I get there and the guy interviews me and after it's over, he tells me that there are no positions available right now. What a trick! Oh well. I came home after that and got ready to go to the funeral home with Carrie and Melanie. We got there and Chris seemed to be taking it well today too. We sat with him until about 7:30 or so. We left and went driving around for a while and then ended up at his house. Carrie still won't let me take the street sign with Josh's last name on it. Melanie seemed like she was mad or upset about smoething. She was fine and happy earlier when we were making fun of the "Waltons." (inside joke between Carrie, Melanie and me). Carrie was kinda acting different toward me tonight after we left Chris's house. I don't know what I did, but she was just acting weird. Melanie seemed to think I was mad at her all night, but I really wasn't. Well, I'm gonna go. Peace out people.

      Today was a pretty boring day. I didn't go to bed until 6:30 this morning. I got a call from Josh at around 10 this morning. Melanie was supposed to call me at 6:30, but she didnt. I was kinda mad about that, but I can't stay mad at her. She's my boo. She made up for it. She called me around 12 this afternoon and talked to me for a while. I talked to Josh pretty much all day, as always. He's my baby. I love him so much. OMG.. The Simple Life 2 premiered tonight. It was so funny. Paris Hilton and Nichole Riche are the funniest people ever. They are so dumb. I went to my friends house and watched it tonight. We had a craving for Chinese food, so we went and ate at Janbo's before it started. Overall, I had a nice night. I got home around 9:15 or so tonight. I called and talked to Josh for a while. I have to wait till Monday to take my driver's test. It sucks so bad. Well, I'm gonna stop writing now so I can go and talk to mah man. I'' catch you guys on the flip side. Later.

      No, Today was Grrreat! I woke up this morning and went to take the written test for my license. Guess what? I PASSED!! After that I went to Target with my mom. That was kinda boring, but oh well. I met Josh at the mall around 1 this afternoon. We had lunch and then I applied for a few jobs. I think I applied for like 10 altogether. I got 2 on the spot interviews today. One was at Old Navy and the other was at Build-A-Bear. They made me sing Happy Birthday at Build-A-Bear. LOL. I have an interview Friday at The Buckle. Wish me luck! After I turned in all my applications, I went with Brandon to Best Buy. He was looking at new CD players for his car. Then we went to Krispy Kreme to get some doughnuts. YUMMM. Then I came back home and talked to Josh on the phone for a while and then talked to Holly for a while. I go to take my driving test on Friday. If my grandma can't take me Friday, then I will for sure go on Monday. I can't. Well, I will talk to you fine folks later. Feel free to comment on any of my entries. Peace out!

      Today was a really boring day. I did absolutely nothing, except go to Target with my mom. Fun Fun. I got a call from Melanie this morning around 9:00. She was getting ready to leave for dance camp. I went back to sleep and Josh called and woke me up around 1:00 this afternoon. I talked to Jaymie on the phone for a while today. I was pretty much on the phone all day with either Jaymie or Josh. I did talk to Holly tonight also. I am going Tuesday for sure to take my written test for my license. I can't wait to get my license. Josh and I are going to the mall tomorrow. I plan on applying for a job. Well, I'm out. Later homies.

      Today was pretty much boring. I slept until I got a call from Melanie at 11:30 this morning. She kept telling me how bad she felt for waking me up. I called and woke Josh up this morning. I was planning on going to church with my mom, but she didn't come home until 5:00 this afternoon. I don't know where she was. I don't really care though. I was supposed to go out to lunch with Casey today, but turns out we didn't. Molly and I didn't hang out either like we had planned. Turns out, Melanie called and asked if I wanted to go out with her tonight. Carrie, Melanie, Chris and Kendall get here and we leave. We went and just hung out for a while. We took Chris home around 9:00. As soon as we dropped him and Kendall off, Carrie started being a major trick to me. For the past 3 days Carrie has done nothing but be a witch to me. I don't even know why. I know I called Chris a trick on Friday, but I thought we resolved that. I guess not. I don't think I wanna hang out with her for a while, especially without Melanie being there. Melanie is leaving for some kind of dance thing tomorrow. I'm going to miss her a lot. I don't know what I'm going to do without her for a week. Hopefully I will get my license this week and Melanie and I can hang out. I know for sure that Josh and I are going to be hanging out a lot. I love him so much. I know I write that every time, but I don't care. I do love him a lot. I wanna spend the rest of my life with him. I am hoping to take my written test tomorrow. Im kinda excited about getting my license. Well, I'm tired. I'm prolly going to lay down. I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo this week. Well, Later.

      My day started out pretty great. I didn't get up till like noon. I went to the mall with my awesome bf Josh at around 4. We stopped to see Molly. She is so awesome. Her and I were going to hang out tonight, but instead, we are going to hang out tomorrow night. Tonight at the mall must have been like "Hot Guy Night" or something. I don't think I've ever seen so many hot guys at one time. Josh and I were checking out guys left and right. Carrie, Melanie and Chris came to the mall tonight too. I didn't talk to them for very long because Brandon came to pick me up. We came back to my house and chilled for a while. Then I asked Holly if we could come over. Of course she said yes, because I'm her Shnookie. I'm on my way to Holly's house and Carrie calls me. She tells me that Chris FINALLY asked her out. I was so happy for them. Chris is a really cool guy and Carrie is so frickin awesome. I kinda felt like Melanie was mad at me for something tonight. Anyway, Brandon and I get to Holly's house and we start talking about random things. Then out of the blue, we got on the subject of sex. Boy was that conversation funny. Two gay guys and a straight girl talking about sex. You will have to read Holly's diary if you want details. I'm sure that she prolly went into a little more detail than I did. Let's just say that Holly, Brandon and I should not start our own town. HAHA. Tonight was actually an awesome night. Well, I might as well end this entry. Later tricks.

      I talked to Casey today. I miss her so much. I think her and I might hang out on Sunday afternoon. It should be fun since I haven't seen her since school has been out. Josh's great-grandpa's funeral was today. I didn't get to talk to him much today, but I love him so much! He and I plan on hanging out tomorrow. I'm not sure what we are going to do yet, but no matter what it is, I'm sure it will be great. I love being around him and I love everything about him. Tonight was pretty much like a rollercoaster ride. It was smooth at the beginning, but then it was all downhill from there. It started off with Carrie and I going to the mall. We were there for a while. We ate and talked and had a good time. Then we went to pick up Chris. He wasn't home like he said he was going to be. It kinda made Carrie mad, because he promised he would go with us and then he didn't. I really think that Carrie was kinda mad at me because of some of the things I said to Chris and about him. (I'm really sorry about that. I know you guys will work it out and everything will be ok.) Oh yeah, Chris found this street sign with my bf's last name on it. It's a pretty unusual last name, so I was surprised that he found it. I think he is going to give it to me. (I really hope so anyway.) Melanie got mad at me tonight too. I really wish that I could understand girls sometimes. I know that I'm not a "typical guy", but somethings about girls I still don't understand. Just so you guys know, Melanie is my favorite trick! We cruised Green for a while and then Carrie, Melanie and I came back to my house and sat and "talked" for a while. We didn't really do much talking though. For all you dirty minded people, NO, we didn't do anything. I like the cock! LOL. Carrie was pretty quiet after we left Chris's house. I could tell that she was upset. Well, I guess I will prolly write more tomorrow. Peace out homies.

      This weeks hasn't really been one of the best weeks. My cousins moved to Kentucky, my bf's great grandpa died, and my great grandma died. I just got back home last night from my great grandma's funeral. It was horrible. I don't deal with death too well. I did have a good time when I got home last night. I called Carrie and she came over and picked me up. Carrie, Melanie, and I hung out at Chris's house for a while. (The trick still won't ask Carrie out.) We are planning on having a good time tonight too. I miss all my friends from school. I haven't seen many of them since school has been out. I've seen Holly a few times, but I miss Amy and Elisa. I really miss Ashley too. I haven't seen her all summer. I'm still with my bf Josh. He is so awesome. I love him so much.  Well.. I'm kinda out of stuff to write. I'll try to write more tonight maybe or maybe tomorrow. Well.. that's all folks.
