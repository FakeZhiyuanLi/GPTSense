What are the general thoughts and feelings that you have noticed in the comunity?  well prdy much everyone is apauled and kinda heart broken...that our leader would do something like that.... its just awful...i just dont know where to turn to.

      im waiting.....grr michelle is taking for ever!! ok so heres the deal michelle and i are both writing on our blogs for twenty min to see who writes more in that time... stupid i know... but oh well.  i've always wanted to live eather on a farm in the middle of no where or to live in the middle of the city. i have always wanted to have lots of brothers and sisters, but in truth, i only have one little brother.  His name is Sasha... well we just call him sasha, his real name is Alexander.  but he has never really gone by that.  Michelle has a brother the same age as sasha, his name is zach.  She also has a little sister, ariana.  Michelle is staying over tonight, we have already had dinner.  My dad grilled some pork chops and we also had asparugus.  michelle just told me a story about how zach once tried to pick a lock on a car with a stem type thing and it got stuck in the car latch thingy... i dont know how to describe it... oh well.  A couple of years ago (maybe it was last year), i gave my brother (sasha) the nickname sushi, and michelles brother (zachary) the nickname zucchini.  that actually stuck for a while but i dont think anyone calls him that anymore (sushi), the just call him sasha.  his screen name is something about sushi though.  My dog is being strange... whatever.  Like i said before, michelle is sleeping over.  I hope we do something fun... we dont really have any good movies to watch so i dont know what were gonna do about that.  Maybe we can go to blockbuster or some place like that to rent a couple movies... ill ask my dad later.  my dad's name by the way is scott, (that means of scottish origin, i dont think he is though, and if so, just a little)  he has a brother, a half brother and two step sisters.  he was the oldest in the family growing up (like me), and then there was kurt, but he died of krib death when he was about five months old.  Then the was steven, he was three years younger than my dad.  And then when my dad was about fourteen, his parents got divorced and he spent his summers with his dad and the rest of the time with his mom.  A while later his mom got remaried (by the way her name is myrna) and she got maried to ray.  He was also devorced and also had two kids, two girls, mary and margret.  so after they got maried my grandma had another baby, annother boy, robert (he is actually here now too).  Uncle rob came for dinner as well.  Sasha is being all obsessive about cleaning the "amazingly cool" bottle.... it is glass and it had "pom" in it, it was a mix of pomogranate and blueberry juice.  He and i split it a couple of days ago, and anyway he keeps putting this blue dish soap in it and it and makes the water in it blue, its really stupid, but whatever.  ------ that was twenty minutes worth of writing.  but michelle is writing something about politics so she wants to add another five minutes and i said fine.... speaking of politics... i am a hard core democrat.  i also was  into skateboarding for about two years or so.  But i quit last year, i was getting kind of bored with it.  I love to draw but im not very good unless i spend about two hours on a tiny little sketch and then you can almost tell what it is ( jk im not THAT bad- but prdy close).  Im reading a book now, that my dad is making me read.  its called spies and its by michael frayn or something like that.  its not the kind of book i usually read.  mostly i read fiction but sometimes i go for some contemporary stuff.  i really like the book sabriel by garth nix, annother book i am reading now.  I tend to read literally five or six books at a time, which reminds me that i have to get my books back to the library some how before i leave for camp with michelle.

      "Traffic In The Sky"  There's traffic in the sky and it doesn't seem to be getting much better there's kids playing games on the pavement drawring waves on the pavement shadows of the planes on the pavement its enough to make me cry but that don't seem like it would make it feel better maybe its a dream and if I scream it will burst at the seams this whole place will fall to pieces and then they'd say...  well how could we have known? I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell if you keep on adding stones soon the water will be lost in the well  puzzle peices in the ground but no one ever seems to be digging instead they're looking up towards the heavens with their eyes on the heavens there are shadows on the way to the heavens it's enough to make me cry but that don't seem like it would make it feel better The answers could be found we could learn from digging down but no one ever seems to be digging instead they'll say...  well how could we have known? I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell if you keep on adding stones soon the water will be lost in the well  words of wisdom all around but no one ever seems to listen they're talking about thier planes on paper building up from the pavement there are shadows from the scrapers on the pavement it's enough to make me sigh but that don't seem like it would make it feel better the words are still around but the words are only sounds and dno one ever seems to listen instead they'll say  well how could we have known? I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell if you keep on adding stones soon the water will be lost in the well   [Thanks to lordygee14@ahoo.com for these lyrics]   "Fall Line"  And by the way You know that hope will make you strange Make you blink, make you blink Make you sink It will make you afraid of change Enough to blame the box with the view of the world And the walls that fill the frame I turn it up But then I turn it off Because I can't stand When they start to talk about The hurting and killing Whose shoes are we feeling The damage and ruin And the things that we're doing Gotta We gotta stop We gotta turn it all off We gotta rewind Start it up again Because we fell across the fall line Ain't nothing sacred anymore Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah Somebody saw him jump Yeah, but nobody saw him slip I guess he lost a lot a hope And then he lost a grip And now he's lying in the freeway In the middle of this mess Guess we lost another one, just like the other one Optimistic, hypocrite that didn't have the nerve to quit The things that kept him wanted more 'Til he finally reached the core He feel across the fall line Ain't nothing sacred anymore Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah   [ www.azlyrics.com ]    --just a couple of songs of jack johnson that i really like... but i couldnt find lyrics  THAT WOULD LOAD  for my fav song by him: cookie jar

      the other day i went to the movie fahrenheit 911 (without michelle....SRY!!).  it was prdy good, very funny, at parts and at others it was really sad and prdy graphic.  i highly recomend it to anyone who is remotely democratic... and even if you're not, its still a good idea to see what the true story is.... even if it is told in a bias fasion.

      I thought it would be a good idea to explain my name to those who don't know what the heck it means.  First off, Ozzie is my dog.  He's a Westie (a West Highland White Terrier) and i love him.  He is absolutely adorable. Secondly, Zlatibor: its a charming little town in Yugoslavia that I've visited at least a couple of times with my grandparents.  I am half Serbian (for those who didn't know),and my mother grew up in Belgrade so its a big part of me.  I do speak Serbian, not very well (any more), I actually learned it before i learned english... but I kinda lost some of it along the way.

      so a couple days ago, while cleaning my room, i found a video that we (myself and my classmates) made in 3rd grade french class.  we talked about the weather and stuff like that... o yea and we did a fasion show... haha i remember that too.  i decided to tie my lime green and black shirt into a belly shirt and i put my hair up in a pony tail on the very top of my head. and marian, i finaly got to see your hair down.  i had forgotten that you used to wear it down when we were little.  lauren, omg you were so funny, you looked so nervous in front of the camera, ill have to show it to you some time, lol.  every one looked so funny... so little, it was cute.  o yea, and i also found a audio tape that i had made when i was 11, i didnt even recognize my voice because it was so high pitched, my brothers was even worse (he was 8 at the time).  ha. i was saposed to be doing my french homework but instead i decided to sneak off with my little tape recorder and make a tape.  speaking of cleaning my room, im not really cleaning it, its more like remodleing.  it needs it too, i havent changed anything (with the aception of putting up posters and stuff like that) since i was about 9... and im 15.  you would have to have seen my closet and desk to truely apreciate the news that i have succeded in conquering my desk (i emptied it out, thats right, there is noting in it, NOTHING!) and the same is true with my now walk in closet, where as before, it was literally knee high in crap.  well thats about all the news for today.... o yea, i forgot to say, im going up to menogyn (its a ymca camp), im going to do a canoeing trip for 8 days, with michelle.  i havent started packing though and im leaving on sunday....hehe.  im really bummed though, because i have heard that starting this weekend they might outlaw any campfires up north, because of the fact its so dry...grr, i hope they change their minds... or have some kind of monsoon before we get there...
