      Friends sometimes can come and go.  You really know who your friends are when they stand by your side when you are down or upset.  There also there all the times that are the best.  I hate when people say Oh my gosh you hang out with them, or did you hear what they did the other day.  How mean and cruel, and I hate to say that that's been me sometimes.  I sometimes never know when to keep my mouth shut, as do a lot of people.  I hate when people judge you on what kind of car you drive, or what kind of close you where, or even your race.  Being a 15 year old teenage isn't easy.  All most everything I walk into a store I'm never greeted, or asked "How may I help you."  I mean our money goes just as far as any working adult.  Kids have to work to, we need to have money to spend.  People have no respect for us.  It hurts me the most when people do that because of your race.  I also hate when people say "Oh! Well so and so said this and so and so did that."  So what! Grow up we are old enough to make our own decisions.  Another thing that annoys me is when adults get involved in our situations, and say "You can't hang out with them," or "Your to young to do this."  that's when you just need to remove yourself and just take a break.  That's why I'm so happy that I have friends that are so caring, fun, and understanding.  We would never do anything like that to people.  I hate when my parents say, "Your 15 years old and you are not going out with them, your to young to date."  I've heard parents just talking in public saying, "Did you see so and so, they were all over eachother."  So what, we are young and want to have some fun.  Just leave us alone.  My friends are the best!  We all get along and are there for eachother when we have to be.  I have no clue why I wrote something like this, I just felt like it.

      Well I really don't have anything interesting going on right now.  I haven't had time to do much, because I'm been so busy working.  I babysitt and work baseball tournaments for my brothers friend.  So I at least have some mad money to spend.  But I really don't know what to talk about so, I'll just tell you what's going on in my life.  My brother graduated from college this past winter, and he now is living back at home.  It sucks, I'm glad he's home but I wish he and I got along better.  He also is helping my dad coach my baseball team, Party On.  We haven't won any games, but we basically just have fun.  My best friend Kevin, he's on the team.  He makes my life fun, he's the tightest kid I know, well next to Tyler who is an interesting friend to have.  But anyways back to my life, haha.  My sister just bought a house and is moving out in September.  Which sucks, because she and I get along great, she takes me places and we just love eachother.  Once she moves its going to be very different.  I really don't see much of my dad, because he has to get up every night at like 12:30 and be at work by like 2 am.  So I only see him for like an hour or so, if he's tired, but I see him on the weekends so.  He has the coolest car, I know its nothing fancy but it can go fast.  My mom is the best mom ever.  She is always there for me.  She takes me out to lunch every day.  She is a stay at home mom because she is dedicated to us kids.  And I know I take her for granite sometimes but I love her to death.  She makes my life a lot easier.  If I get a bad grade she doesn't yell at me she just says "Try Harder".  If it wasn't for her I don't know where I would be.  This saying is something I think that everyone should live by, "Live Life Like Tomorrow Isn't Happening".  Think bout it.

      My family has kind of drifted away from eachother.  I mean my immediate family are very close, but I mean my aunts and uncles!  What basically happened was that my uncle had an affair with this lady from work.  She has ruined my family.  I can no longer have a phone conversation with one of my relatives without them bringing it up.  My grandma has literally kicked out my aunt (the one that husband cheated on her) out of the family.  It was so hard for me at first to believe that something like this could happen.  I mean how could you just throw away your entire life to be with some lady who has been divorced three times has 5 kids each with different people.  My uncle lost his wife, his house, and most of all his two kids, my cousins.  There son who is 23 and is in the Marines.  He is serving is second tour of duty in Fullujia.  His base was bombed twice in one day.  His friends left to go on a convoy and were blown up.  He could have been on that convoy.  I am so afraid that I sometimes can't even watch the news because of what is happening.  He doesn't need to be worrying about what's going on over here, when he is suppose to be fighting this war for us over there.  My uncle wants my aunt, his wife of 20 years to move out of the house there kids grew up in, and sell it, so he can get his chunk of change.  His daughter, another one of my cousins can't even talk to him because she is so disgusted with him.  He ruined my brothers college graduation party because the rest of our family didn't want to see him.  He basically turned everyone against eachother.  My family has decided to stay out of that business and just try and be everyone's friend.  I have two other cousin that won't even talk to my aunt because of what people have said.  They wouldn't even say hello.  That hurts to know that people can be that cruel.  I wish people would just stay out of other peoples business.  I can only hope for the best!
