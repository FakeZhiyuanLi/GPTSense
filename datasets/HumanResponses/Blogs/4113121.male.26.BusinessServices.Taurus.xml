      perhaps you guys are wondering "is this site being shared by 4 guys? Wiljohn, R2, Jao and John, who are they? they are all me.  ok let's start with:  WILJOHN...that's my given name. i wouldn't normally use it not unless we are talking about financial matters or legal documents.   R2...is that short for ur fullname? ur initials? Ricky Reyes? Rannie Raymundo? is it read as "AR-AR" like RR Herrera? aaaaarggghhhh!!! i encounter a lot of those questions and i answer back it's just R2 pronounced as "artu". that's what they call me in the call center industry. nope i'm not a robot but yes i got it from r2d2 of starwars! i'm a fan! I chose to use that name coz i find it cool, short and people would easily recall except for those who up to my last day with the company was still calling me ARTHUR! aaaaarghhhh it's arrrttuuuu! hehehe! c",)  JAO...my apologies to Jao Mapa for being dragged in this crazy name game. Well, i've got no one to blame but him coz he's the only "celeb" then with such name. For you guys who doesn't know him, he was supposedly the 4th member of the "GWAPINGS" who appears regularly in Palibhasa Lalake aired on channel 2, just recently had an issue with Ms.Osang. U remember him now? Shao, my lesbo bestfriend (who i love so muuuucccchhhh) gave me this name back in my UST days. So, my entire college days i wasn't known with the two prior given names...Thank God there's such thing as graduation. That ended the name but for the benifit of my UST friends i would still acknowledge the name.  JOHN...one of America's most common male american name. that's what they would call their washroom. the lu--in europe, toilet--in australia, banyo--sa pinas, kasilyas--sa probinsya namin. they are all the same. surprisingly many gurls would be named JOHN. to those of my era, i know you still have those petnames given by ur folks and nicknames na uulitin such as jing-jing, ton-ton, lyn-lyn, meng-meng and jon-jon for me. those are just some of the reasons why i prefer to be called something else. is there anything wrong with me? Now am i sick? what do u think?  it's fun being given names. see, it brings back memories...great memories of my past.   let's see.......hmmmmm.....i'm at a new chapter in my life...australia...going back to college...i wonder what name to use now. you have any idea? what do u have in mind?  =P
