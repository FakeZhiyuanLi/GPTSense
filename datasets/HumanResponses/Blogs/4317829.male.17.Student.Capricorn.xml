						    Have you ever wondered who keeps sending all those ridiculous email forwards to you? T  he ones with the warnings..This chain has not been broken for about nine months now...Please do not be the one to break it !!   And the even "scarier" ones which say that if you do not send this to so many people something seriously bad will happen to you!!!   Where do these people manage to cook up all the doomsday stories?   Why isn't there a single sane person who believes that this is all a hoax and stops the mail there and then???   They say that almost 50%of the email sent each day is spam... How many of these are chain mails???   I float this question off into cyber space (or blogspace).. Does anyone out there actually know anyone personally who didn't send out the chain letter and suffered as a direct consequence??? Send in your answers and we shall soon see that this is all a hoax!!!   on a personal note...I never forward these... except if the matter they contain is very nice to read..

						    Did i mention i'm doing EEE in BITS, Pilani?   What do you get when you take people from all across the diverse regions of India.. and stick them in a village on the outskirts of civilisation?? Well, come down to Pilani.. and we'll show you!!   The place has a culture of its own!!   The strong Dravidian influence has lent itself to Bitspeak.. in the form of a 'da' after every sentence.. almost as a punctuation mark!   Bitsians don't waste words, or letters... "Ob" is used for obviously and "laccha" for laughing and chatting. To study all the time is to "ghot"..   If you haven't yet figured out why I am redifining your English, its because I might use a few of these terms in my lated blogs.. and you ought to understand them! The Queen's English is rarely spoken in entirety anywhere in the world.. so why should I have to stick to rules?

						    A friend introduced me to blogging yesterday..   we both suffer from diarrhea   of words.. so this unfortunate site was chosen to siphon off all the rantings that others refused to listen to..   Poor mortals.. they will never realise what they have missed..   you can check out his at rammed.blogspot.com    he has a slight head start, but i mean to catch up very fast..   Remember...   "Those who can, do... those who can't, BLOG!!!"

						    I seriously hope no one takes offence at my title..  Its just that with nothing to do (except a test series and department work)   and no one to siphon all my unheard speeches into, i was kinda bored.   So i decided to blog... and the rest as they say..is history!!!   (History in the making...at least for now)   comments are always welcome..
