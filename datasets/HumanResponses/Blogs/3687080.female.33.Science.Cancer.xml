						   My little boy  loves  to run!  He wakes up running in his crib, jogging in place when I set him on the floor, a wide smile consuming his face.  Run!  Fast feet, fast feet!  And he's off.  Our home is circular in its layout, so he begins most of his days doing laps.  Run!  Peals of laughter, the thump of his feet ~ I have a growing appreciation for wearing shoes in the house because then I can tell where he is by the thudding on the hardwood.  But as his speed has increased, so has the severity of the falls he experiences, and the sound of the fall is much greater too.   Crash!   By the sound I can tell if it involved him alone, or if there was a piece of furniture involved, if his head met the floor (Bone and flesh has a unique thump), and so on.  But then it is my turn to run!  To get to my little one in order to comfort, hold, rock, and maybe even cry a little myself.  Sweet boy!  So happy and then so devestated.  Sunday he was in a particularly fine mood, dressed and ready for church, running, and then  boom!   Tripped over a little stool and led with his head, contusion over his right eye.  And my heart broke... because this time I couldn't immediately run to him.  My mom is here, and I heard her cry out and dash to pick him up and comfort him.  I was changing Liberty's diaper, so I weighed her down with a heavy stuffed animal on her belly and went to my son.  (By the time I got back to her she had kicked both of her little feet in the contents of her diaper and managed to somehow paint the bedroom wall with it...)  It was a thought that was with me all day ~ running and falling.  When children trip and fall I've heard parents say, even to little toddlers like Izak, "that's what you get for being cocky!"  Do you  honestly think   that cockiness had anything to do with it?!?!  How about the fact that their legs are too short, feet are too small, and their head is a third of their body weight?  Do you think that could have anything to do with it?  What an ignorant, disrespectful thing to say.  And when little people fall, how many parents saunter over, rolling their eyes.  I think it is this posture that I have assumed that my Heavenly Father has taken with me all my life.  I run and I fall, and He hears the thud... and as He slowly rises to come to me He rolls His eyes and huffs a little, totally inconvenienced by me.  "If you hadn't been so cocky..."  Today I had the first thought that perhaps  God runs  to my side to comfort me, speaks words of ease and tenderness as He gently lifts me up and brushes me off, whispering "I'm so sorry that happened.  It's okay, it's okay."  Can I believe in a God that is  that  kind,  that  loving?  It is a far cry from what I have thought all of my life, though I know scripture speaks of a devoted father, one who loves even more magnificently than I love my son (possible?).  When they speak of Heaven they say, "He will wipe every tear from the eye... there will be no more crying there...".  Yet He desires to run to us now ~ here.  Had I never become a mom of a little boy who lovers to run I think my misconception would had gone unchallenged for the rest of my life.

						   Matt and I were very intentional about the names we gave our children.  In light of what I have shared about mothering, the names needed to have deep and abiding meaning.  Izak is the Czech spelling for the biblical name Isaac.  My great grandfather on my mom's side was Isaac Bond.  He fathered 16 children, 8 boys, 8 girls.  The original Isaac of the Bible was the son of the hundred-year-old couple, Sarah and Abraham.   The name means laughter  because when Sarah found out she was pregnant, she cracked up laughing in disbelief.  I can identify with her, but the primary reason I love the name is that it flies in the face of sobriety.  It brings you joy.  And mothering in the presence of joy is a gift...   Liberty means freedom .  And I want to teach my daughter as early as possible about real liberation from the bondage of sin.  Maybe someday I will have the opportunity to share with her how God used motherhood to change the course of my life and set me free.  Secondly, I do love my country and am very patriotic ~ I hope she will also have a deep respect for America, and for the service men and women who have sacrificed so that she can be free.  It could be argued that America is not what it should be, that it is no longer the country looking to God, blah, blah, blah.  I am thankful to be here vs. other countries in the world.  I am thankful that my children have been born here vs. other countries in the world.  It is one of God's immediate blessings on my home.  Mothering in an atmosphere of freedom is also a gift...  It's late, my brain is mush, and Liberty is bright-eyed and bushy tailed.  *sigh*

						   Growing up, I never had the sense that I ever wanted to become a mother.  I can remember joking around about having a big bunch of boys so that I could have half a football team, but that was just a joke.  It was more about my deep love for football than children.  I never got the "warm fuzzies" around babies, though I babysat for pragmatic purposes only.  Once I could get a "real" job I never babysat again.  The desire for an exciting career and fulfillment in financial independence was a driving force in my teens and twenties.  I never thought about adding kids to the mix; a husband ~ yes, kids ~ no.  And if it hadn't been for an old home movie, I don't think I ever would have reconsidered.  Christmas 2001 I was home visiting with my husband.  I came across a collection of old home videos from my aunt.  It was a compilation of years of home movies that my uncle had taken, no sound except for that of the soundtrack that it had been set to.  I spent hours in the night, watching for a glimpse of my family.  Sure enough, there was my mother, young, newlywed to my big lug of a dad, handsome, butch haircut, no gut.  And they were smiling, it appeared to be a holiday gathering.  And there was my Grandma Pearl, walking, eating - what a shocker since the only grandmother I had known was a woman riddled with Parkinson's.  And Grandpa Frenchie, laughing, hamming for the camera.  The next shot of my mom showed her with a huge belly, due any day... and the next time the camera caught my family I could hardly watch.  There they were with my tiny newborn sister, Stephanie.  She wasn't focusing on anything though her eyes were open, limp on mom's shoulder.  And I saw this look on my mom's face, one of deep pain and fear.  My father was trying to be jocular and gentle, but there was an underlying sadness there.  My big sister was born 6 weeks early in 1968 with multiple handicaps, physical and mental.  The extent was unknown.  While watching the footage with my mom later that weekend she burst into tears, rocking back and forth, and cried, "I was so scared... so scared."  And suddenly I understood why I never wanted to be a mom.    It was no one's fault, specifically  not  my mother's fault, that I absorbed and assimilated my family's experience like I did.  There are many kids who have handicapped siblings that joyfully have families of their own.  But I will say that the brokenness of the human condition, and the desire of the Evil One to keep God's children in bondage were two factors that allowed me to be stunted in this arena for 32 years.  I walked around knowing that I had a limp in the motherhood department, but I was  not willing  to let God heal me and provide me with an opportunity to trust him  once I saw the limp .  Therein lies the difference.  When I knew that God wanted to free me by actually having children of my own, I was mortified and a bit embarrassed.  I had said a loud "never" for such a long time, priding myself in my own tenacity, my own ability to protect myself from such "pain."  We cannot protect ourselves from pain, but we can ensure that we are always a slave to the  avoidance  of pain, which is a dull ache that never goes away.  To willingly refuse God's hand of healing leads to a madness that says "My God is not enough, He does not want the best for me."  I am so thankful that God did not forget me in my pain.  I am grateful for the persistent love that pursued me into the desert of stubborn brokenness.  I am made new, not because of my own effort, but because He truly knows what is best and has a good plan for me.  May He receive great joy in my obedience and freedom.

						   As I sat in the hospital after giving birth to my second child, I was thinking that I may start a blog.  I really enjoy reading my husband's thoughts/reflections (love you, Honey), and it's not like I don't have my own.  After all, I was  almost  a writing minor in college, but I'd already taken 5 years to get a four year degree... .  Many times I downplay or completely avoid talking about my true feelings as they relate to parenting, motherhood and spiritual issues.  I don't feel that it's always the brightest thing to play an opinion card which has deep emotional ties to me and has been thoughtfully examined, only to be put under the microscope, or just blown off.  This is much safer (I think).  So between chasing a toddler, breastfeeding an infant, and running my home I thought I might try this and see if I can capture some of the truths that I am discovering during this time in my life.

						   Well, Monday was my first day back to Roswell and  I loved it !!!  Matt had a great day with the kids, he even managed to get showered before I came home (which is more than I've accomplished today).  I had a wonderful time.  I actually floated to recovery room (PACU), a place where I am gaining expertise and comfort.  Now I'm trying to figure out how to get more partial shifts in, mainly in PACU because they can use me for 3, 4, 5, or 6 hours at a crack, and I don't need to be there at the beginning or end of a "shift."  The nature of recovery is transient, in one door, out the other, so you don't have to cover a patient for 8 hours.  So I'm praying and thinking about who to entrust the kids to, just for a few hours, until Matt can come home and take over. The goal being not to spend the money I'm earning on child care.  God bless Matt for even attempting to work with me... the man has a crazy schedule and he does a great job balancing it all.  Work makes me feel powerful, competent, valuable.  I like work, but it can be like a drug if I'm not careful.  Too much is bad.  I found myself looking forward to when Libby is in school so I can pick up more time, and then I felt guilty for wishing this time away... .  When I got home Monday and my little girl curled nuzzled into me with her tiny hand touching my chest I thought, "This, this is the most important job."  Sometimes it's hard to sort out the immediacy of everything,  everything  feels urgent.  Making more money, getting Libby to learn to sleep without crying, getting Izak to eat food, or at least reject food without flinging it across the room, making more money, getting my ACLS certification, dating my husband (without the 3rd wheel) again-- and the list goes on.  I am certain that I am meant to be a SAHM first and foremost.  This job is actually what  allows  the rest of my life to be in balance right now.  But, oh, I love work...  I laid Izak down for his nap today and he was having a big ol' party in there!  Screeching, laughing, jabbering ~ I could hear things being throw out of the crib, a bottle bouncing off the dresser.  All of this is sometimes normal but it seemed much more raucous today.  Usually he quiets down and sleeps, but 45 minutes later he's still going strong.  As I walked by his doorway to check on Libby, I happened to glance at the bottom of his door.  I could see light coming out of his room!  And when I opened his door I found that I'd left the light on when I closed him in.  Note: Toddlers do not nap well when the light is as bright as day.

						   ( Warning : This blog contains content that will make mothers and mother-in-laws nervous.)  First of all, I overheard my husband say that good bloggers post everyday or every other day.  How depressing.  I aim for twice a week!  There have been many sermons during which the Christian body was compared to the children of Israel.  The sermons were about the brave ~ "Be strong and courageous" ~ and how the itty bitty army had enough faith that the walls of Jericho fell.  For the most part I don't usually identify with  that  generation of Israel.  Their parents, the previous generation, the ones who were cursed to die off, wandering around the desert and never enjoy the promised land of God because  they had no faith , yeah, them... that's my crew!  I'm not proud of the fact that I am a coward, but it's a fact nonetheless.  Ask my friend, Laura.  She wanted to know what my greatest fear of the upcoming year was, and without hesitation I said, "Fear of financial failure, that we won't be able to make it."  That's my favorite fear of all times, rivaling that of motherhood.  Well, you know what God says about fear?  "Fear Me.  I should be the biggest thing on your radar."  And if He's not, He has a way of becoming so by being the only answer to the situation you feared would happen.  I have heard zillions of people say, "My biggest fear is (fill in the blank), and now it's happening to me!!"  I think that it's because God will not allow something so big, so controlling like enormous fear, become an idol in His children's lives.  He refuses to compete.  And before you know it, *poof*, you're lovingly placed smack dab in the middle of crap creek without a paddle, by His permissive will. Why?   To work it out , and get fear in perspective.  That being said, I hate working it out.  When I decided to be a SAHM (stay-at-home mom) I gave up the ability to contribute several thousand dollars a month to our household.  Fortunately, Matt and I had been downsizing our lives for a few years, getting rid of a big truck payment (oh, how I miss the Tacoma!), settling into a little home with a little mortgage when originally we could afford more, just simplifying.  But I don't think anything could quite prepare us for what living on one income would be like.  How a lot of the time it's paycheck to paycheck, forget about making any real headway on your loans or debt to avoid interest.  I am not complaining (well, okay, I'm whining a little bit), it could be much, much worse.  But when my definition of "having enough" is "enough to go around with a lot left over", I find that things are tighter than I'd like.  That brings me to manna.  That funky bread-ish type of food that was given each day to the wandering whiners in the desert (along with some quail for protein) for 40 years.  It was enough.  Each day there was provision, but here's the kicker--  it was only enough for that 24 hours .  And that's where manna makes me crazy - "Doesn't God know I need a plan?  Doesn't he know I need a nest egg?  Relief?"  This morning as I was getting out of the shower I thought, "What if God came back tomorrow?  Wouldn't that be great?  Then the debt and bills wouldn't be an issue!  And we wouldn't have to worry about fixing the minivan, or paying the hospital for the delivery, and I will have had just what I needed for today!"  Being off work for 8 weeks without pay has given Matt and I a chance to watch God provide, and He has... but looking ahead... will there still be manna?  Or will we have to rely or our own means of providing, which just end up enslaving us more?  And God says, "You want fear?  Fear me." *poof*  And another thing, manna could not be stored.  If the Israelites attempted to put it away for the next day it would rot, waste, go unused.  One of my big boo-hoo's in the event of having a daughter (which I did) was, "I don't have any clothes for a girl!"   I still have a huge stash of boys clothes, so many for Izak, that some went unworn and are in boxes and boxes of storage in the attic.  Mmmm, manna.  And then the inundation of beautiful clothes that I've received for Libby has been overwhelming.  And sadly I look at a lot of these pieces and say, "What a waste that some will not even be worn."  As I sat folding and hanging up the manna, I mean, clothes, Matt came home and found me stewing.  I said, "At first I thought God was blessing us with all these clothes; now I think He's just being a smart a**!"  We both had a good laugh.  But it sounds like manna, doesn't it?  So, after I get done having a good cry from sheer frustration, I beg God for wisdom and stamina to make it through this hard time.  Matt says that the financial need we experience makes us rely on God in a way we wouldn't if we were rich.  There are some days I would take that check for a million bucks and not care two hoots about dependence on God for this kind of provision.  Believe me, I can be bought for a price.  God must know that, and loves me too darn much to lose me to easy living.  So I get to wander a little bit more.  Great.

						   As you may know, I work at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in downtown Buffalo.  It's a research center, not dissimilar to the National Institute of Health, that has essentially three wings to it - 1) research, 2) testing and 3) patient care.  Roswell Park actually was listed in the top 5 cancer centers in America the year I started working there ~ now we're wayyyy down on the list.  We had a problem with our accreditation as a cancer institute a few years ago and that's really screwed up our rank.  Roswell was actually one of the first research institutes in America dedicated to cancer issues.  Since I know I'm called to work with the dying, and those living with cancer,  I love it there .  I meet a lot of really special people.  I'm often asked how I can stand to work with people who are, in general, dying.  (I know plenty of patients who would argue that they're not  dying , they're  living  with cancer.)  I've found that people who are battling cancer can be incredibly refreshing.  Since they've received a harsh wake-up call that the end may be very near, they tend to not play games any longer.  They tend to be brutally honest.  They are, most often, more real, living life to the fullest, putting things in order, and grappling with the terror of the unknown.  I fell in love with cancer patients the day I began caring for MD, a 43 year-old New Englander who loved God and his family.  He was dying from kidney cancer that had spread to his bones 8 years before I had the privilege of being his nurse.  The first thing I remember seeing when I walked into his house was a picture of him, his wife, and two small children.  This rendered me virtually useless.  I could barely look him in the eye during our visit because I was so upset that this young father and husband was dying a terrible death.  I was so flustered when I left, MD later told me that his comment to his wife after I left was, "Wow!  I sure upset that young lady!"  MD was a professional fisherman-turned associate pastor.  We became dear friends. I signed over his case to another nurse so that my husband would have the privilege of knowing him and his family as friends.  We attended church with him.  My daughter's name is his daughter's name.  We attended his wife's remarriage several years after MD passed away.  We knew him one year.  I was pulled deeper into the world of oncology by WH, a 50-some year old man who had Stage 4 sinus cancer.  He had undergone surgery to remove the tumor and in the process had lost his left eye, upper jaw/ hard and soft palate, and sinuses.  I could literally look into the hole that used to be his eye and see down his throat.  I visited WH in his home twice a day for months to change the packing in the hole in his head.  It was perhaps, one of the most gruesome things I've ever had to do.  I remember after I changed his dressing for the first time I had to go into the bathroom and put my head between my knees so I wouldn't faint.  WH had the most amazing sense of humor.  When I told him to be sure to be "good to (himself)", he took that as a cue to buy a laser scope for his BB gun.  He was then able to shoot squirrels from his bathroom window again, a feat greatly hampered by the loss of his depth perception.  He was tickled pink.  I knew WH one year.  Just a few months ago I met an outstanding young woman in the ICU.  LE was my age, mother of twins, and was dependent on the ventilator.  Her cancer had destroyed her lung function.  She was coherent, mouthing words around her ET tube, and writing a fury on her grease board.  She had a fantastic sense of humor, even a bit of sarcasm.  She had been diagnosed with cancer while pregnant with her twins.  She delayed treatment until after they were born.  They are 3 years old now.  I was 9 months pregnant while caring for her, and we would have long "conversations" about the ailments of pregnancy.  I cared for her the day we had to talk with her about having a surgery for long-term ventilator use (tracheostomy), the truth of her failing condition becoming clear, and the chances that she would return home again fading.  We were all crying when she wrote on the board, "I want to see my kids."  The hospital was eventually able to arrange for her children to visit.  LE was a Christian.  She listened to praise music in her room all day long, even having moments of private worship, moving her lips to the words, swinging her toes back and forth to the beat.  I was so blessed the days I cared for her because I was able to listen to my favorite tunes and hum along all day.  We prayed together at the end of our days together.  I visited her when she was moved to a different floor, we shared CD's and pictures of our kids.  We laughed and cried together.  I went out on maternity leave unexpectedly without saying goodbye.  She passed away May 30th.  I knew her 3 months.  Her death is the hardest to swallow.  But she was the most inspirational person yet.   I can't wait to get back to work on Monday!

						   Someone recently commented that they didn't know how I could blog in the midst of bringing a newborn into the house and chasing the 21 month-old.  Well, I'm not sure either, but it gives me a chance to have some grown up thoughts that lead somewhere.  And don't worry, I only blog when everyone's asleep.  I had a funny experience the other day when I was watching Sadaam Hussein (sp?) on TV.  The commentators were reporting on his behavior, his changing moods, how he went from reserved to a little bit crazy, and I thought, "Poor Sadaam.  Of course you're a little off your rocker!  You're sleep deprived too.  I know how that feels, but you've been deprived since Christmas!"  And for a  brief   moment I had pity on the poor man.  (Note:  Overall I think he's evil, and not at all a poor little old man, but for the sake of the blog, give me some slack...)  The opportunity to get up in the middle of the night definiely pushes my natural ability to function.  But it's amazing what kinds of thought come at 3 A.M..  The other night I found myself staring at Libby, making sure she was asleep.  I was about 6 inches from her face b/c I'm legally blind, and I forgot to put on my glasses when the initial milk cry rang out.  The phrase in Psalms, "I think of you through the watches of the night, I think of you through the watches of the night" kept echoing through my mind.  And then I realized the beauty of those night moments.  The ablility to recall the tiniest bits and phrases of comfort found in memorized scripture is a real gift.    I have one of those memories, it's been called photographic, though I don't believe it is entirely true.  I love to memorize things (especially strings of numbers).  But the ablilty to recall scripture was something I learned early in parochial school.  Memory was a class that you received an actual grade for.  We worked on scriptures, song lyrics, and creeds.  Some people are able to put away entire books of the Bible at a time.  I love taking the occasional verse that speaks to me, whether because of it's profoundity or it's poetic beauty, and squirrel it away in my mind.    A verse that I've been absolutely savoring for about a year now is I Thess. 4:11, 12 "  Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life  , to mind your own business, and to work with your hands, just as we told you, so that your life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody."  There aren't a lot of ways you can argue about it's meaning, are there?  It has been helpful in managing the affairs of my home, and not fussing about how much I'm supposedly missing out on as a stay-at-home mom.     And then there's the Psalm "I wait for the Lord, my sould waits, and in his word I put my hope.  My soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning, more than watchmen wait for the morning."  I am guessing that sincere waiting for the Lord brings with it a sense of deep longing, because during those sleepless hours  I really wait for the morning !  And I long for the day when I will sleep throught the night again, (sadly) even at the expense of those precious times of recalling gems of scripture in the night.  They are bittersweet.  Bitter in that my body cries out under the weight of it's frailty, but sweet because He watches over my sleeping daughter along with me, and I sense His presence.  "Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she has borne?  Thought she may forget,  I will never forget you .  See, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands, your face is ever before me."  Is 49:15, 16

						   As I've revealed in an earlier blog, my older sister, Stephanie, is handicapped.  Today she is a happy, routinized 36 year-old woman with the overall intellect of a 4 year-old.  I'm sure Mom would argue with me because, yes, there are some areas where Stef is functionally older than 4, but other areas where she is less than 4.  She cannot, however, be left alone to take care of herself.  Well, you could, but she would make the decisions any good 4 year-old would-- "Now, where are those cookies?"  If left to herself during mealtime she may be found eating spoonfuls of ketchup or sugar, yuck.  If left to herself she could not dial the phone, or put out a small fire, or write a letter.    A few years ago my nephew, Tyler, Stef, and I were riding in the back of a truck.  He stared at Stef for the longest time.  I could see his brain trying to decide what to say.  I braced myself, because no matter how much I like a person, the minute they make fun of the handicapped they find themselves on my imaginary hit list for years to come.  He quietly said to me, "Mom says that she's a grown-up on the outside, but inside she's always a little girl."  It makes me cry even now to remember it.  What a perfect description.  And the enormous respect it gave me for my sister-in-law at that moment can never be explained.  To be  that thoughtful and careful  as a mom, knowing that your son would need a way to understand what he was about to see... Suzy, you're one of my all-time favorites!  I can remember being a teenager, and Mom coming home from an annual evaluation meeting where all of the disciplines who cared for Stef got together and went over "how she was doing".  (Mom ALWAYS hated those meeting.)   This one was harder than others had been because they were trying to convince Mom that Stef was "low trainable", only a few IQ notches above being considered "severely handicapped."  Mom wouldn't buy it.  "She's more than that," she insisted.  My mom has always been Stef's greatest champion, believing more than was ever predicted for her child's future.  Stef was born 6 weeks early (but weighed over 6 pounds!!!) at a hospital in Detroit, Michigan.  She was blind at birth, a diagnosis that wasn't caught until months later, but at nine months miraculously began to see... sort of.  She's had Coke-bottle lenses since her nine month birthday.  Her corrective prescription was so strong that I can remember my little sister and me putting on her glasses and running around as a game.  It made things look warped and uneven, like everything was a mirror in a carnival fun house.  Poor kid.  Mom made monthly trips to the doctors, who never were able to give her a real diagnosis, just bits and pieces.  "Cervical nerve damage, " "cerebral palsy," "reverse swallow mechanism," and my personal favorite, "other mental and physical handicaps."  "She will never walk, talk, or be able to remember sequences."  Upon discharge for the hospital following her birth - and this is the honest truth - my father was approached by a doctor who told him he had some papers for my Mom and Dad to sign.   The doctor said, "You can just go home and forget you ever had this baby."  I believe the papers were to either 1) make Stef a ward of the state and institutionalize her for her entire life, or 2) euthanize her.  My dad told him what he could do with his papers, and he took his wife and daughter home.  Gosh, I could fill a book about growing up as the younger sister of a handicapped child.  Someone once asked me, "How did growing up with Stef effect your life?"  My response was, "It impacted everything, the way in which I see and process the whole world."  It has made me less trusting, because I have seen children and adults taunt Stef when they thought no one was looking.  It has given me an overdeveloped sense of justice - I just  love  it when the bad guy gets it in the end; perhaps because  SO MANY  S.O.B.'s who ridiculed my sister seemingly got away with it (for that moment).  It has made me the eternal advocate.  I am constantly trying to speak for the "victim" or the voiceless.  It has made me angry at the Church in general, something which no self-respecting pastor's wife should admit.  In my hometown churches I regularly saw people, some considered "saints," who dealt cruelly and impatiently with "the least of these," not just Stef, but other handicapped children in the congregation.  My sister loves church, especially the music.  I don't know how, but this child, who was never supposed to remember things in sequence, has somehow memorized the hymnal!  We lovingly call her "Johnny One Note" because though she knows them, the songs are more or less moaned out loud, but if you listen you can barely make out the correct vowel sounds corresponding with the actual words.  One time, one of the saved-and-sanctified club cornered my sister in the foyer and shook her finger in Stef's face and demanded her to be quiet during the singing of the hymns, "You don't sing pretty!" she hissed.  My mom, the amazingly poised woman that she is, witnessed the incident with a broken heart, and publicly wept when she saw Stef with her finger silently pressed to her lips, the "quiet" sign, during that evening service.  Stef didn't sing out loud for months after that.  Oh, the stories I could tell you--  As you can see, I'm the one who grew up handicapped.  Yet the God who allowed Stef to be placed in my life, who saw the roots of bitterness wind their way down into my young heart, is also the same God who faces me today and says, "Out with it, Heidi.  Time to give up the pain that you've carried on her behalf all these years."  He is a trustworthy friend, the author of True justice, the champion of the downtrodden, and the Head of His Body, the Church.

						   Happy birthday to me.  I was reflecting this morning about how different my life is today as compared to what I would've guessed it would be like when I was in my 20's.  I am slightly sleep deprived, not because I'm working a double shift as a doctor or a trauma flight nurse, but because I'm nutritionally linked to my breast-feeding-every-three-hours-newborn daughter.  I enjoy receiving birthday presents, but when Matthew asked me this morning what I would like I did not reply,"A wonderful weekend at an inn."  Instead I said, "A hot shower before you leave for work without the toddler peeking into my tub every minute or so."  I am thinner than when I was in college, but not because I have that dream gym membership with the rockin' aerobic classes.  I can't manage to get a decent meal in me because I'm either chasing Izzy (who hates to stay still for too long)or snuggling Libby (who hates to be alone for too long).  I treated myself to a special birthday breakfast, but it wasn't a quiet time of consuming a fruit parfait and hand-made breakfast sandwich from my favorite coffee house while lounging at my favorite stream in the state park.  It was 5 cinnamon Timbits, a small coffee, all picked up from a drive-thru window-- oh, and a big chunk of an old oatmeal raisin cookie that I found between the kids' car seats.  It's funny.  Life is not what I would have expected, but it's all good.   Really good .  I feel so lead by God during this time in my life.  I enjoy His presence, His strength, His wisdom.  I enjoy knowing that I am pleasing Him each day I undertake the challenges of my home, my calling.  Yes, somedays are hard, but it is a choice as to how I will respond.  Resentment or resolve?  I resolve within myself to savor this time.  The bitter and the sweet.  Staying home on maternity leave without disability pay= (-) $XXX a month Siphoning off savings to be a stay-at-home mom= (-) $XX a month Knowing that I am in the center of God's will right here, right now =   PRICELESS

						   (WARNING:  This blog contains candid reflections about birthing babies.  Men, you've been forewarned.)  Both of my children were born naturally.  By that, I mean that I did not use any pain medication during labor.  Labor for Izak was 20 hours long, 40 minutes of pushing.  I "won" a Pitocin drip for the last 8 hours of the experience, a medication which increases that frequency and intensity of the contractions, because my body was "taking it's time."  Not uncommon with the first baby because the body isn't totally sure of it's job yet.  Twenty hours wasn't bad - I was prepared for 24-26.  Libby's (serious) labor was about 3 hours and 20 minutes, pushing lasted about 40  seconds .  It was intense. However, I spent two weeks laboring during the night.   Two weeks .  It was incredibly frustrating.  But once I went, I went fast!  One of the advantages of natural labor is that I can remember every second of both births.  A girlfriend of mine who is a midwife in Boston said, "I believe that the reason labor is so painful is because it's nature's way of saying, 'Pay attention, something BIG is about to happen to your life.'"  I couldn't agree more.  I don't discuss natural childbirth very openly.  Women are very protective and sometimes unnecessarily defensive about their birth experiences.  When they manage to figure out that I didn't have drugs with my birth, they usually stop listening (or even asking good questions) and launch into a long explanation about their particular reasons for their choices during their babies' births.  And then it becomes a telling of their story, yadda yadda... and I stand there thinking, "but I didn't ask...".  Validation of one's experience is the driving force.  Fortunately, I have my husband to validate my experience because he was there by my side, coaching me thru each birth.  He is always quick to boast about my birthing skills; my favorite phrase is, "She's the special forces of birthing women, like a navy seal or an army ranger."  I revel in his pride of me, of  us  (natural childbirth is a team effort) but very quickly I'm usually left with a staring woman who has stopped listening, and I feel bad because I'm usually not even given the opportunity to explain why I chose that route.  If I think that the conversation is about to end, I usually chirp, "I did it because I wanted to see if I  could  do it."  And that's mostly true.  I enjoyed the challenge of pushing my body, especially since I was victorious.  But the main reason I go natural is because I want to eliminate the variables in my child's future.  When Izzy turns five and still can't tie his shoes I won't be left thinking, "Was it a drug I took at birth?"  I'm relatively underexposed to pain medications ~ I do not know how my body would have reacted to Nubain.  I have heard many women reflect that it knocked them out to the extent that they could not push effectively, let alone be mentally present for the event. And I'm enough of a control freak that I want to be present and accounted for to make decisions on behalf of myself and my child, even in the throws of labor.  That is something I refuse to abdicate.     Another point is that I feel somehow connected to history going naturally.  For centuries women did not enjoy the relief of meds.  It was a thing you groaned and sweat through, a rite of passage, wondering if you might not just die in the midst of it, in order to arrive on the other side.  The relief of the other side of labor cannot be described. "A peace that passeth all understanding..." :)  My great-grandmother, Frances Kathryn Ledvinka, was a midwife in Czechoslovakia.  She graduated for the University of Berlin.  She also practiced midwifery on the sly in the U.S. once she immigrated at the request of obstetricians.  I did not know her, she died very young, but having birthed naturally I cannot help but feel like went back in time and walked for a few hours with my great-grandmother.  Not sure what it is, but it has a very timeless quality to it.  I remember a moment during my labor with Izak when I thought, "I am going to die now."  Just like that, matter-of-fact.  Here is my end.  And then I can remember the other side of my brain screaming, "You are not going to die!  They don't just let women die in labor nowadays!"  But the experience was that intense!  And after Izak was born I said, "I think that's about the dumbest thing I've done." (Referring to going without pain meds.)  After Libby was born I also said, "Now I'm sure that this is, by far,  the  dumbest thing that I've ever done!!"  It was the adrenaline talking.  I think it's a common reaction when you've just done something very daring, perhaps even dangerous, for the good of another.  Like jumping in to the rapids to save someone who couldn't swim, or running into a burning house to pull out a child.  Much like that.  But it was for the good of my son, my daughter... and also  very good  for me.

						   Well, we're one week after the family's big visit for Libby's dedication.  Saturday my mom, dad, and sister surprised me when they just showed up at the house!!!  I was floored.  Dad had made a snap decision on Thursday to try to make the trip, mom jumped into action to set up care for Grandma (96 years old and not a very good traveler), and they made it!!  It was a blast to have my folks there too.  I was completely unprepared for 7 visitors, let alone 10, but Dad dashed off to the grocery store the minute he got here and all was well.  We    FEASTED    for two days straight.  Meals were bursting with choices ~ grilled chicken marinated in the local sauce of choice, Chiavetta's, burgers, fresh corn on the cob, hot dogs, munchies, fresh fruit from Michigan, homemade poppyseed cake (from scratch, an Old Country recipe from my gram), and lots of kosher pickles.  I had an awesome time helping to serve my family and my family-in-law.  It always surprises me how nicely our two families fit together.  In one sense, it's like they've know each other a long, long time, longer than the 12 years matt and I have been together.  Matt's dad was in the area of special education, and Matt's sister, Sarah, is a special ed. teacher, so they are all confortable with Stephanie.  Matt's step-dad, Birt, was a music minister and I think that could've been my dad's second calling in life.  The Bennetts are musical to the core.  Both moms are RNs.  Suzy has a flair for entertaining so effortlessly, and it seems like that's all we did while I was growing up ~ entertain tons of people.  Even with the similarities, I think that the shared foundation of Christ and His work in our lives is the biggest common denominator.  All of us know God personally, even the cousins, so we are , in essence, all brothers and sisters of the larger spiritual family.  Saturday and Sunday I was back on worship team, helping lead our 2000 member congregation in music.  What a blast to stand up front and hear their voices blend in song.  I am always blessed to look into the faces of the hundreds of folks, whose stories I've come to know and love, and watch them sing with all their might.  Yes, this is their testimony!  And see the hands lift up, especially when there's a particularly poignant line that has been a part of their specific journey.  It's a gift.  And while I'm leading I, too, am striving to communicate that these songs are my testimony as well, not just empty words.  Each time I lead or solo, I take the time to meditate on, and own each song I sing.  I believe that if you can't bear witness to the things you're singing, you shouldn't sing.  That doesn't mean that if you're struggling with surrender, or contentment, or belief that you can't lead.  But transparency and integrity means that you are wrestling to reconcile the words with your life.  When I knew that God was calling me to have children, it was the act of owning the worship songs that said, "I give my whole life to you...I will follow you... I surrender.." that kept the proverbial thumb in my back to work towards whole-hearted obedience.  And the peace that I had, especially while I was leading worship pregnant with Izak, I will never forget.  "What can I say, here in Your presence?  I am undone, here in Your presence.  You are God, I am Yours."

						   Michigan family is on the way!!!  My bro- and sis-in-law, their 3 boys, and Matt's parents are making the trek to see the youngest cousin.  We're going to have a great time!  This weekend we are dedicating Liberty to God.  She will be 8 weeks and 5 days old.  She will wear the ecru dedication gown, hat, and booties that my mom crocheted as an heirloom for our family.  (I still have to sew the rosettes back on - they were removed for big brother).  The service (and this was all Matt's idea) will be officiated by all women.  They will speak, pray, and read scripture about godly womanhood.  Best of all, they are living examples of outstanding women that I want Liberty to know and love.  When my reflection of God is innaccurate or wharped, may she find the truth about being a daughter of the King in the women I keep in my inner circle.  And may she be protected from the ones I keep in the outer circle.  I am trying to prepare myself for the sensory overload of visitors.  It doesn't take much, especially when you're 1) an introvert and 2) sleep-deprived.  I live life with a great deal of censorship and that requires a bit of margin.  I think carefully about responses and try to monitor myself a majority of the time.  It doesn't mean I'm disingenuine, just calculated.  There are very few people with whom I can lift off the screen and let myself be unplugged.  There's a time and a place for that, primarily with my small group ~ the Musielaks and the Gobles ~ and a few other friends.  There is a balance between censorship and being totally candid.  People exercising the extremes of both should, in my opinion, be avoided.  But for me, I trend towards censorship.  Probably out of a need for control, or image management.  Something vain like that.  But I'm also reminded of a saying that hung on my RD's refrigerator that inferred that the better you know someone, the greater care and courtesy you should extend to them.  Now I'm not saying that shooting from the hip brings with it rudeness or meanness, but it can unintentionally if you're not careful.  Which then brings you back to censorship.  Lol.  I'm too tired to talk about stuff like this with any coherence.  So Libby will be dedicated on Sunday, and that afternoon we will have cake.  I'm planning on 30-40 people, and for once it looks like we may be able to have the party  outside  in the sun!  I'm running out of cogent thoughts.  Two of my friends have been diagnosed with cancer in the last two weeks.  More on that another time, I'm sure.

						   I used to look forward to my morning walks with Izak.  It was a great way to blow an hour or so while waiting for his afternoon nap to roll around, I could get some fresh air, Sailor could get rid of some of her energy and keep her nails filed down.  But then Libby came and has made it abundantly clear that she  does not like  morning walks!  First she starts by grumbling in the car seat.  When I put her pacifier in she sucks on it with an angry look (the scowl she has is all Matt!), her little fists clenched.  So I pull a blanket over her to block out the light (and make me forget that I'm at fault for dragging this poor kid out of her nap for an overstimulating walk).  Meanwhile, Izak has decided that yes, he should kick the foot rest of the stroller with great force, bouncing the whole set-up with a steady rhythm.  Under the cover the grumbling increases to a howl.  Then Izak eggs her on by imitating the cry, bumping the volume up a notch.  Then I turn around on my route and head home, foiled, discouraged, and accompanied by the waaaaaa-mbulance of crying children.  So much for my morning walks.  It's better if I just stay at home and make sure Libby gets a good nap, or four good naps, in a nice quiet, dark room.  Actually, this is a cornerstone of my philosophy to encourage healthy sleep.  Be home for naptime(s).  Have naps happen in the familiar environment of a room and crib with minimal noise.  Strive for early bedtimes with bedrock routines.  Do not push for a later bedtime in hopes that the baby will sleep in later (because you will more than likely get an earlier wake-up).  All of my sleep beliefs have been formed by the book  Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child  by Dr. Marc. Weissbluth.  Fantastic research, right on the money as far as his findings for the various age groups.  MW sites our mentality of needing to be "on the go" as a major culprit in raising sleep deprived, crabby, inattentive kids.  The whole notion of "if he's tired he'll sleep" is something I avoid at all costs.  In my particular situation, to push the kids to play along with my perceived need to be on the go would be selfish.  I do not have to be anywhere or go anywhere that is paramount to their needs for a good nap.  I am delighted to take care of well-rested babies.  I am tortured when I've had to care for stressed-out, crabby babies.  If I have to go somewhere then I try to schedule it during naptime and arrange for a babysitter.    I know that I'm a frustration to my friends who were hoping for another playmate when I became a SAHM.  I refuse to push my kids to play when I know they should be sleeping, and as MW puts it, " sleep begets sleep ".  The more rested a child is, the more he'll be able to rest.  I was beginning to see more of people and accomplish more daytime errands when Izak dropped his morning nap around 14 months of age.  It really was fun, going and doing more.  But now Liberty has reminded me that babies need to sleep (almost around the clock), and my main job for now is to protect that need ~ even if it means no more morning walks.  So amidst the daily awareness that I may grow chubby, sluggish and low-toned, I am reminded that the nature of motherhood is bittersweet sacrifice.
