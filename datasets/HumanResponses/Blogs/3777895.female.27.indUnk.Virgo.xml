      I wrote Illusions in 2002, when my life was very different and very sad, and I was constantly screaming inside to find something better. Shimmer was written in 2000, when I didn't know what to do with the pain isnide me.  Palestine was written in 1995, insprired by a voice, one voice, that touched me . . . That darkness is gone now, and I often find it difficult to even find the voice that was once inside me.  I don't want the darkness back; however, I do want to hear the voice.  I need that voice to shimmer.  Illusions  I catch a glance of my image in the mirror  Haunted eyes stare back at me,  Pleading for something more.  Have you ever needed something, so unattainable,  that it tore at your soul?  Ripping  Shredding  Leaving it empty  As the void grows larger  I try to fill it with false hopes and empty promises  Salty tears sting, as they roll down my face  In a rage, I lash out at the longing reflection  Shattering the glass and my hand  Slowly creeping, a red stain spreads on the stark white carpet  I stand there,  feeling nothing, but my need for you.    Shimmer  Sweet despair. It envelops me with the blackness of my own heart. I pretend not to notice that I am dying inside, because to notice means to care, and I don't. Not yet. Perhaps never. I fall through life, blinded by my own tears. Help me. Help me. I see the sky as the souls go to heaven. I watch the sunlight reflecting from them, shimmering in the clouds. I want to shimmer.   Palestine  A shadow on the wall,  a voice in the air,  where is this going,  and why do I care;  a mere obsession that will soon pass,  last time it was severe,  tonight it was dear,  next time you’ll be too real,  too human,  that will change the way that I feel,  it does, in fact matter,  you aren’t human,  you’re more,  you’re a god,  a voice, a shadow on the wall,  1,2,3,4,  as the beat goes on, I long for more,  or less, depending on how you look at it,  the curtain hangs behind you, reminding me that the Dead are dead  and the time is gone,  breezes flow around the room,  circulating the smoke and of course, the air,  the same air your voice is in.  You touched me tonight,  not just your voice and your music,  but your hand.  When you touch more than my soul,  I begin to wonder why I call out to you at night  and why I dream of your haunting melodies.  Those songs stay with me forever or until I forget.  Doesn’t matter I guess, does it?

      The thunder and lightning is crazy outside.  The rain is a deluge of water falling from the sky.  Nothing outside can shimmer. . . nothing.

      I like the look and title better now.  It seems less dark, less a part of the past and more a pathway to the joyful life I want to lead. . .

      One cannot help but wonder, when picking up the case, whether the June 14th release of Zack Hexum’s “the story so far” will resemble that of his older brother’s band, 311.  Once you hit play, the mystery dissolves.  Los Angeles-based, by way of Omaha, North Texas, and New York City, Zack has his own sound; one influenced by years of study and practice in jazz and rock.  He blends these influences with an ease and flair, unexpected from someone in his mid-20’s.  Not falling into the trap of many commercial singer/songwriter releases, “the story so far” offers variety and distinction from the competition.  Autobiographical in nature, the 11 tracks allow listeners, as the title indicates, see into Zack’s “story so far”, without sounding contrived.     I listened to it the first time in the car.  I had 30 miles to drive and wasn’t looking forward to rush hour traffic.  I opened the CD and fed it to the CD player, hoping that it would make the trip go fast.  This amazing album stunned me.  It opened with “Met a Girl Like You Once”, a song that may sound recognizable to fans of Fox’s “The OC”, as it was featured in a recent episode.  From there, I was hooked.  Each track was better than the last, until Zack’s soulful voice sang the final words to the last track, “One Spin”.  It is difficult to choose a favorite track, as each song promises to be emotionally raw and intimate, with a rock edge.  Zack’s sound and lyrics do not cater to any specific social group, leaving the door wide open for a diverse fan base.    Sitting by him in French class and listening to him jam in his basement didn’t prepare me for how I felt when I listened to “the story so far”.   Zack Hexum is destined to be another amazing catch for What Have You/Trauma Records, who signed, No Doubt and Bush, before they were a household name.  Like his predecessors, Zack sings with heart and uses his musical gifts to create an intimate connection with his listeners.  Don’t take my word for it.  Pick yourself up a copy and check it out.  It’ll be the best $15.00 you spend this summer, plus you’ll have something to listen to on the way home!
