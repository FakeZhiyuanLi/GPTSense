The woman replies very sarcastically, "How did you guess?"  He replies, "Because you're damned ugly."

       Numero Uno   Here begins the beginning of a new beginning. A fancy new "blog" to bore myself (and perhaps others) with in 2004...  I thought to myself, "I have many random thoughts, so why not document them?"   In the future, this will be referred to a "Dumb Idea #1"...Until then, I'm largely indifferent about the whole project...I find that I have little to say when presented the opportunity.

       Bring me the head of Boba Fett.   this is an actual conversation my sister and I had.  (for reference, I changed my msn messenger picture to a picture of boba fett)    TV 14 Debbie says:   COKE. i like it. "bring captain solo to the cargo hold"    (She says "coke" when she thinks something is cool. it stems from the way her friend brittany would mispronouce "cock ass" (sounding like "coke ass"), and she would say it in place of "kick ass". )    TV 14 Debbie says:   does boba fett have any other lines than that?    Sideburns says:   "he's no good to me dead"    TV 14 Debbie says:   yeah, that's much better. anything else?    Sideburns says:   i'm thinkin...    Sideburns says:   "What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me"    TV 14 Debbie says:   he's not really a dialogue intensive character. but if you can say "put captain solo in the cargo hold" and make it sound cool and quotable, then it doens't really matter.    Sideburns says:   exactly    TV 14 Debbie says:   so he says, what? 5 lines in the whole trilogy?    Sideburns says:   yes, if you count the girly scream when Han hits his jetpack and he flies into the side of jabba's sail barge    TV 14 Debbie says:   at least it's not the wilhelm scream    (the wilhelm scream is this famous scream from an old cowboy movie, and people who make big sci-fi epic movies use it al lot. it's in every star wars at least once, and in all of the lord of the rings movies. and countless others. )    Sideburns says:   true    Sideburns sends:   5-ESBputsolo.mp3    (an mp3 of boba fett saying "put captain solo in the cargo hold" )    TV 14 Debbie says:   wow, that's not edited very well.    Sideburns says:   no, but it's just for reference    TV 14 Debbie says:   i figured    Sideburns says:   Fett also says "As you wish."    TV 14 Debbie says:   oh yeah, that's a good one    Sideburns says:   it's when vader turns to him and says "no disintegrations"    TV 14 Debbie says:   hmm. so most of boba fett's quotes are sentence fragments? nice.    Sideburns says:   yup     Sideburns says:   you wanna go get lunch here in a little bit?    TV 14 Debbie says:   sure. not till noon-hour though ; )    (She says noon-hour because one of her bosses is from fargo north dakota, and she seriously says noon-hour.)    Sideburns says:   or noon-thirty even    TV 14 Debbie says:   probably noon-hour, because i ate potato salad and tortilla chips for breakfast, and potato salad and tortilla chips do not a healthy breakfast make.    Sideburns says:   oh my god that sounds horrible    Sideburns says:   i've got the dry heaves over here    Sideburns says:   ack    TV 14 Debbie says:   it was actually pretty tasty. oh, i had some bread-and-butter pickles and orange juice too    Sideburns says:   blldsljfaaaaarrrhghggek!!!!    TV 14 Debbie says:   this is the best part: and i got towards the bottom of the glass of o.j., i noticed it had a crust of dried food in the bottom from the dishwasher! bum bum bummm!    Sideburns says:   ok. I've just died from nausea    Sideburns says:   please collect my body at 5pm    Sideburns says:   or whenever you leave    TV 14 Debbie says:   that's funny!    TV 14 Debbie says:   it's really hard to express laughter with out sounding sarcastic.    Sideburns says:   a-thank you    --b

       Army Helicopters   I had this weird dream last night...   My Sister and I were driving home on 10th street, near where a church had recently burned down. Instead of the usual houses, there was a large lake on the left side of the road. Large Army Helicopters were hovering above it, lowering smaller Army Helicopters into the water. We slowed down and looked a minute or 2, decided it was suspicious and alien-related, but drove on.   Later I'm at home. My Sister didn't want to go back and look, but I did. Strangely, the only way to get back to the area was a weird interconnecting tunnel that goes from our house, through the neighbor's house and beyond...   I go through it, but I find myself in the neighbor's backyard, trying to get to the Davidson's house. On the other side of the fence is a large brown dog who wants to kill me. There is another dog as well, but he is just barking. Also, for some reason, I am shirtless.   I don't recall how I managed to get past this, but I made it back to the lake...only now it's just a large puddle in our back yard where the pool is now. It is dark, but there are a few lights trained on the puddle. Toy helicopters are hanging from something above, and several of my toys are set up to show a scene in which aliens have landed in the water, and the Army (now consisting of some transformers and my G.I. Joes) is attacking them. Some of my robot G.I. Joes now serve as Aliens.  I find myself very confused at the situation. Then I wake up.

The 1st (and only) place we looked at was pretty cool, a two-story, 'townhouse' affair...The bedroom that would be "mine" seemed very small, but I could manage. ..I'd have to rent an extra space for all of my stuff, but I'd figure out something... I could stand to get rid of a bunch of stuff anyway.  Also, I bought one of these today:   urlLink     Very cool.

       That's a great plan, Walter. That's fuckin' ingenious, if I understand it correctly. It's a Swiss fuckin' watch.    I got dragged into going to an Office Baby Shower for a woman I've never met. I'm not sure if this is standard Baby Shower Protocol (this being my first Baby Shower), but this poor, timid woman had to sit at the head of the table and open each gift, determine what is was, decipher who gave it to her, and then deem it "cute." She spoke barely above a whisper, and seem to have difficulty reading all of the gift cards. If she hesitated in declaring the "cuteness" of an item, the other women would start to go "awwww" to keep her in line.   I got the distinct impression that she didn't like or didn't understand any of the gifts given to her. Another woman sat nearby, frantically scribbling a log of each gift and giver, for reasons unknown.  It was a bizarre peek into a strange ritual that I couldn't possibly hope to understand.  But there was cake at the end.

       "Dorothy Mantooth is a Saint!"   It's been kind of crummy day...I found out today that I've been turned down for Financial Aid this semester because I've taken too many hours to qualify...I'm not sure what I'm going to do...The class will be expensive to pay for out of my own pocket, but if I don't take it I never will...  I was ten minutes late getting to work to day...Not really a big deal, nobody will notice, but it seems I'm always late...It's becoming a trend...I keep missing my favorite shows and then forgetting to record them when they rerun...and I keep sleeping later...leaving no time to take a shower in the morning. I seriously haven't showered since Friday...God Bless deodorant.  It's weird...I feel like I'm ten minutes behind everyone else all of the sudden...  you know, that would make a great novel, or a really, really crappy one...

       A New Hope   It occured to me today, that I am the only one who reads this "blog", and even I don't really read it that much. I think the problem is that I never type anything interesting. That changes today.  1. I think I need to start drinking more. The alcohol. I feel like I'm not fully taking advantage of the fact that I can.   2. I need to buckle down and get that tattoo. "Pirate Skull and Crossed Sabers" all the way.&nbsp;     &nbsp;

       A typical day   Work Journal - Tuesday June 13th, 2004  12:00pm - Arrived at work. I am scheduled to work from 12:00pm - 5:00pm  12:05 - 12:15 - Checked e-mail. Mostly junk mail, and a few requests for web pages to be updated.  12:15 - 12:18 - Updated various web pages for RSC site, answered or forwarded Webmaster mail. This is the only actual work I've done today.  12:18 - 12:30 - Surfed the web, checking my favorite sites for the latest info on Movies, Music, and Toys. Basically just wasting time.  12:30 - 1:13 - Talking to my friend Kenny via MSN messenger. He has registered a new e-mail address that corresponds with the title of the proposed cheesy horror movie he wants to make.  1:13 - 1:20 - More web surfing.  1:20 - 1:23 - Kenny briefly appears online again, more MSN messenger nonsense.  1:23 - 1:26 - More web surfing.  1:26 - 1:27 - Changed my Desktop Wallpaper. Goodbye Ron Burgundy, Hello Yoda.  1:27 - 1:29 - Snagged a piece of Chocolate Cake from the Break Room  1:29 - 1:35 - Eating delicious cake.  1:35 - 2:58 - My Co-worker Susan presents me with a challenge to find a larger version of the “Yahoo smiley face that’s going ‘shhh’”. I have no idea what she is talking about. I end up having to make the image from scratch. She gets kinda picky about it (mostly because the hands I drew ont he image didn't look quite right.) and doesn't like the first 3 or 4 versions I make. It takes forever to complete. I don't really mind though, it kills time.  2:58 - 3:40 - More web surfing.  3:40 - 3:45 - Watched Strongbad E-mail - http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail107.html  3:45 - 3:55 - Bathroom Break / Trip to the Vending Machine. I get all the way to the vending machine and realize that I have no change. Decide to grab a bottled water from the office fridge instead.  3:55 - 4:52 - More web surfing.  4:52 - Leave Early

       Sergeant, burn the fields and when you're done with that, burn the house.   urlLink "Teen Wolf"  was on cable last night, and it's one of those movies that no matter how many times you've seen it, you have to stop and watch every frame...  Here's some fun Teen Wolf Trivia:  "...For anyone who hasn't seen it, watch the last few seconds of the movie before the credits roll. Michael J. Fox blows off the Hot Blonde Chick to make out with his friend, Boof, which has to rank among the most improbable scenes in movie history. That's followed by Fox jumping into his dad's arms ...   only right as they start hugging, you see someone in a red sweater sitting behind them who stands up, and his pants aren't even buttoned, much less zippered up. And this goes on for about two seconds before he realizes what happened, so you see him calmly buttoning himself up. Two seconds later, they freeze on that picture and we get that creepy slow motion montage with the closing credits. Highest of high comedy..."        "These waves are mine."

       If I'm addicted to anything, it's sparklers.   So I surf on over to IMDB.com, and a headline jumps out at me: "Falco's Secret Triumph Over Breast Cancer" And my first thought is: "That  Rock Me Amadeus  guy had breast cancer?" Then I realize that I'm a moron.

       Come on, bring your green hat!   I went to Big Lots ™ on the way to work today, and picked up some snack food to store in my desk at work.  Big Lots ™ is a close-out store, so you can be reasonably sure that 95% of all of the food they sell is out of date, or dangerously close to it. But it's cheap! They also had some bootleg Transformers toys that were pretty cool...It didn't buy any, but I kinda like knowing that they're out there...  One of the things I did buy was a box of the deliciously awesome Gardetto's Snack Mix...The box contained seven 3.75oz bags, and only set me back $4...not to shabby...Now I don't have to pay $0.75 for a bag half the size from RSC vending machine...  Take that, Oscar Rose!  About Gardetto's:     Manufacturer: General Mills Sales, Inc.  Taste: This mix consists of knot pretzels, two kinds of bread sticks (one kind about an inch long and 1/4 inch in diamater, and another kind shorter, fatter and with sesame seeds), pumpernickel melba toast, and short pretzel sticks (about an inch and a half long). All items have a thin coating of a very tasty seasoning. There's less variety than some snack mixes, but it's a great combination, with no weak links. The melba toast and bread sticks are very crunchy, and the pretzlels are smooth, without much salt, giving the mix a great overall texture.  Aroma: Very little.  From the package: "Quality Since 1932" ... "If this product is not fresh or in good condition, tell us where and when you bought it, include the code and we will gladly replace it."

       It's so hot... milk was a bad choice.    There's something wrong with me...  For example, there is this product display at our local mall. It is for some sort of bathtub/shower attachment, and the sign says "Bathtub Fitter - The Perfect Solution."  Every time I see it, I think to myself "Bathtub Hitler - The  Final  Solution."  That's just wrong isn't it?

       And this here's the TV. Two hours a day, either educational or football, so you don't ruin your appreciation of the finer things.    I wandered off from my desk today and went to the school library...I often do this, mostly to avoid work, and because I like to read...  I was lazily skimming the book titles, when a collection of 'Will Roger's Daily Telegraphs' caught my eye. I have always heard of Will Rogers, and I knew he had been described as a "humorist", but I had never really read anything he wrote.   The book appeared to be a collection of daily telegrams he had sent to America while he was in Europe in the 1920's...I read a few of them, and chuckled at a few obscure or dated phrases he would use, and after a while I realized that Will Rogers was  really  funny...He was talking about events and fads (such as swimming the english channel, a craze that apparently swept the globe at one point) that took place some 60+ years before I was born, but it didn't really matter because of his humorous writing style...He would write things like how he had been thrown out of a cricket match for applauding and being a "boisterous element"...  It's hard to describe, but it was funny...  I'm going to have to sneak off tomorrow and read some more...

       You know, there's like a butt-load of gangs at this school. This one gang kept wanting me to join because I'm pretty good with a bowstaff.    Napoleon Dynamite.  This little film is, by far, the funniest movie I have seen since I went and saw Anchorman like, last week.  Napoleon Dynamite is the kind of film that is so good, it alters your vocabulary...You walk around for days saying "What the flip?!" and accuse people of "Eating all of our steak!" You dream of  urlLink sweet  bike jumps, nupont fiberware bowls, and ligers (bred for their skills in magic.)  Soon, the film will fade into memory, the phrase " This one tastes like the cow got into an onion patch " won't be a funny as it used to be, and I'll be able to look at tater tots without having a compulsion to stuff them into my pocket, but until then, I'll be throwing the phrase "Heck Yess!" into conversation until people beg me to stop.  LUCKY!
