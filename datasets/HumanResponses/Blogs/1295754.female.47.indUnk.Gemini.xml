      Especially in the warm weather... Actually I am thinking it is not a cold but that I am allergic to my assistant manager... Wouldn't that be a hoot!... I was fine til he came to my dept. And stood next to me... Then I started sneezing and my eyes got all itchy...   I have been thinking lately about dimensional stuff... Like several dimensions living within other dimensions and not interfering with each other... I don't mean "not interfering" because they are being courteous, but because they are oblivious to the existence of these other dimensions... I think it can explain alot of strange occurances in peoples lives... I know it can explain alot in mine... I have to give this more thought... I am not a real "heaven or hell" person... and I have found a sort of comfort in this dimensional thinking... anyways, I will get back to you on this...  laters! me

       I decided to start over on my Blog   Getting ready for Inventory at work on the 9th of June... This year I am not going to stress out like I did last year... As long as nobody dies on Sunday I will be ok... Also checking to make sure all my prescriptions are filled too... I have my Plan of Action all made out and I am determined to stick to it... No faltering...   The Saturday after inventory, I will be picking my nephew and 2 nieces up from the airport!!!!... They will be visiting for a week... I am soooo excited about this... My niece Jennifer and nephews Andrew and Christopher are the kids of my sister Christine and my brother-in-law Dave... Andrew won't be visiting right now... Soon though, I hope... My other niece that is also coming is Elizabeth, my sister Maggie's daughter... Abby, Maggie's youngest won't be coming up this time... She is going camping with some friends...  Well, just wanted to get this started... laters!!

      Well 2 days to go til Inventory!... I lost it a little yesterday... but then we (Me and JoAnn) had already put in 15 hours and I was tired... ready to go home... and found out I still had a couple hours work ahead of me... I broke down... Janice and Mel came to the rescue... they printed out my listings and labels for me so I could leave... THANK YOU!!!! Maybe if the people in my dept would move with a little more urgency AND they would see I need a few more people in my dept... things would go a little more smoothly... wait... just seeing I need more people won't make things move smoothly... because they already see that... they agree... so??????... The bright side to all this is that starting next week, JoAnn will be on days, seeing school is out... but then I think to myself... I shouldn't have to pray for summer to get things done in my dept... why should I lay all this on JoAnn????... I was once told that people are set up to fail... if this was the case, I have failed way too many times to still be there... at least in my mind anyways... I know my potential... I also know my breaking point... more than that, I know how I can be when I pass the emotional stage of feeling like nothing is going the right way and I get overwhelmed... I don't like going there, but maybe I should... just to see if it truly makes a difference...  There is a joke among a few at work that I have many faces... there is Maryann, she is fun and a little goofy... Jaryann, she has some emotional issues... Caryann, she is the bitchy one, she doesn't really come out too often to too many... and then there is Red, she isn't too different from Caryann except that when she wants something done she wants it done... another that doesn't show her face too often... If I could just get Caryann and Red to team up together without fighting I might have a good thing going... So, CMK, I might have to give this a try... see how well the 2 can work together... I surely hope this doesn't blow up in my (Maryann's) face...  Well one of us will report back and let you know how it goes... LOL...

      I am late again getting anything posted... but I have a good reason... nieces and nephew are here from Florida for a week... They got in Saturday evening at the Gary Airport... of course I was crying like a baby when they touched down...  Jennifer is the one who I think went throiugh the biggest change since I saw them last... 2 years ago... she is taller, a little more mature looking... but still acts like Jen...  Christopher is also taller and is still a giggler... and the spikey hair-do is no longer there... Elizabeth is... well... Elizabeth... I really think she should have been born a blonde (no offense to all the blondes out there) but, she is truly the picture of just about every blonde joke out there... but we love her just the same...  After we got their luggage we headed off to Johnel's for dinner... got home and showed them where everything was and proceeded to sit and watch 2 movies... Shrek and Cat in the Hat... I couldn't make it all the way through the second movie... Sunday we went grocery shopping then to the mall... came home and slowly made our way into the freezing water of the pool... After turning several shades of blue and heading to purple, we got out, made some suncatchers, ate hot dogs and watched Blackhawk Down... Then it was off for frozen yogurt and a drive... 2 nights in a row I was asleep before my head hit the pillow... Today we are taking the train to Chicago to go to Navy Pier, Buckingham Fountain and Millenium Park... Going to the bank in a few to cash in all my change I have been saving for this event... probably have about $200 in there... we should have fun... gonna take alot of pictures... We will post some on my website...   Well gotta go get ready... Laters! Me
