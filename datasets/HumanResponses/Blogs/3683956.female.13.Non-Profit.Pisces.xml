       I (Tishy) is doing a story about a bald frog who had a wig! ENJOY....    There once was a bald frog and he wanted some hair. Although all frogs are bald, i guess this one was extremely bald. So one day he gathered leaves and made a wig out of it. Mr. Hair Less Frog was very contented with his new found toupee. He wore it every single day... Even though all his friends laughed at him, he didn't care! One day all his leaves started rotting and it eventually grew into his bald head and it became permanent leaf hair. Eventually, since this is biodegradeable material, it started to dissapear and fall off his bald head one by one... poor Mr. Hair Less frog was depressed again. One day as he was watching Chloe and Tishy's news broadcast, they announced that doctors have finally found a cure for a bald head... Mr. Hair Less Frog was so contented of this that he died of heart attack!!!!!    END
