           What a day I tell you. Hearty chatting, hearty dinner, hearty puffings, hearty jokes... All ended with a hearty PUKE from shaunni boi. Wat a way to start his 22nd year in his life, throwing up in the presence of gals. First, Ivan took him on to the 'Cai Quan' arena. 1st round ended in a thrashing, shaun finished the whole bottle. Then came a flop, Jon the undisputed champion actually lost to shaun. Helplessly, Jon had to finish his bottle. While Shaun struggles on his 2nd.      Then came the highlight... Shaunni and I were entangled in a 'never say die' challenge. Both were equally good though, at first. However, Kenney got into a sudden good form, thrashing shaunni yet again. Before we can even finish off the round, shaun called for time out. Initially, no one expected anything unusual, then came the birth of Merlion 2004. It came unexpectedly. Shaun puke onto the table, where my bottle was. The worst part was, he tried to contain his puke with his both hands, only to expose the sight of the puke being seived thru his fingers to us. Lily, her sister and friend, were the most disgusted. They have never seen nothing like that before. Well, everything has a virgin try, so I guess shaun took their 'virginity' on this one... *Tsk tsk tsk..       The past birthdays weren't a bit like this. Ivan's one was at Plasma, and we even get to see that waitress, Joanne(FF). Superb nite, hearty too. Then was mine, at red tea house, those drunkards tried to make me 'DOH', but aku strong. Followed by Randy's Kbox session at suntec, everything was peaceful, but not much of atmosphere. Shaunni's one is the funniest, heartiest(Ivan came back), and FLOPPIEST. Watsup with that man shaunni...      Whatever the case, hail the Disney ambassador, Shaun :       - Mickey tatoo on the butt cheek.   - Dumbo tatoo on the dick.   - Goffy's tone of speech.   - Donald's beak when he finishes up Tom Yam Noodles.      Cheers to a evolution to the 'mistake' of LXG, we shall call him 'Disney ambassador' from now.

            Today at school was superb. Realised that 'big eyes charisma' is in my maths lecture. Wah, she looks attractive man, with her big eyes, and charismatic smile. What is more appealing is her black top and 'pink overhead bridge'. Super girlly, but goes well with her maturity. When she was walking into the LT, I actually saw her looking at me. This looking over, seeing there thingy is making me ponder.. What issit that these eye contacts are telling me? Then when she turned behind to look at her frens, I was like mesmerised in her looks, then suay suay genna caught for looking at her. ~Haiz, that moment lasted mahjiam one full minute. Somehow, I think her frend beside her keep spying over, cos I was looking at her backview thru out the Lect, and her fren like peeping behind. ~hmmm....          Maybe she noticed me looking at her, but since school started, I have been seeing her around everyday in school. Not that she is prominant, but she attracts my attention, somehow. Simple, and yet appealing. Maybe I should just do wat Jonnie says, start with a wide SMILE, then follow by eye contacts and ACTION. Gonna be difficult man, I guess cos I got withdrawal syndromes.. Hahaha.. Maybe not, but gals dun like wishy washy guys. So I am ready to strike...          I felt great after IBM, cos I noe wat Nageb is trying to teach. Somemore, today is super hectic, super taxing. Cramped everything into 3 hours. Almost impossible.. Had lots of tutorial qns to prepare. Shucks, think have to biah harder man. Well, felt quite relieved to only have to juggle between econs, maths and IBM for now. Wait till accounting and finance starts on 16th Sept, then I will be a greenhorn starting to crawl man. Yitez..           That is the only thing holding me back whether to think about matters of the heart during this 3 years man. Somemore, Nageb says his student got 2 offers from OCBC and UOB at the same time. So I guess our BSc really got power man, even though she had 2nd upper. So all these motivating factors have made me even more eager to Biah hard in studies.           Then again, I jus chatted with Kelvin on 3 yrs total shut off from 'Matters of the heart', is almost impossible. And I quite agree with him. Almost impossible, but that is for him, I think I can tahan ba, jus concentrate on going school, swim, and gym lah, No distractions pls, Gals wait outside...

           Today, I swam as if I was in ATHENS. I think my motivation outbeat the swimmers. Last week, I swam 36 laps, and today I hit my personal best, 46 laps. Felt superb, and was glad I have a nicer tan now.. The turnoff was, when Kelvin and I stepped out of the complex, we saw a chio gal with super tanned body, nicely highlighted hair, and great figure. Haiz, why didn't we jus swim a bit more...      I jus realised that I tackled an olympic athelete before. POH SENG SONG, the hair mahjiam genna 'Baniak' gel, then slapped to one corner. Well, when he plays rugby against us, I tackled him, and he could not even stand up straight. *cher. National sprinter, he better produce result man, and make me proud.. Hahaha. According to the news, the ministers shed tears after Ronald Susilo's Loss to that Thai yan dao. Ya, a long wait for such anticipations on winning. But ronald's lacking in mental strength blow us all away. Anyway, he is the least arrogant sportsman, who has been sent to Greece. So I support him all the way, even till now. At least his face not so stuck up. If I were him, I will feel damn 'Dui'. How many times in your life, do you have an almost instant chance of becoming a millionaire? Winning the gold medal, will make him a millionaire, but... I feel for him. Ronald, tml go buy big sweep, winning is 2 million. Better chance...      So now, all we have in Athens, are just the PING PONG GALS... Li Jia wei and dunno who, but thank god that veteran Jinx Gin Honky tong is out and retired from table tennis, if not Singapore may have to tahan a few more years to have more new blood pumped into the game...      Well, tomorrow will be thurs and it is a full day for me. Maths in the morning, and IBM in the afternoon. So I think I better wear something comfortable, if not I will suffer the whole day. So I must tuned myself into 'Vasantham central' frequency for R Meena's class. Looking forward to Nageb's class, cos he damn kok, and lame. Most importantly, the gals. Superb Cais, all around for my radars to be active.       SUMMARY : School still the BEST. I love to STUDY...! YESH....

           Fuah.....! I tell you, this gal in school is like a radio man. She complains like a non-stopping ticketing machine, even though Jonnie and I noes that she meant no harm. She is from MGS, and she sounded like she's from a neighbourhood school man. Well, not a bad gal, and her name is Jessie.   Sweet looking, Big eyes, Charismatic... Hmmm, Prospective huh. Not really, She smokes... And she smokes MARBs ML, jus like me.. Haiz, still NO la. She too english until her chinese cannot make it. One piece one piece one, not as fluent when she complains about china students in her english, and super accent. No Potatoes for me, cos I eat Kong Bah one...       Then there was this 'Ah Lian' Abang Jon was telling me about. Wore a red top and a denim skirt, and a tube-shaped LV bag. We werer damn bad, because we were laughing at her, and wondering how in the hell she put her notes into her bag. Probably rolled them like scrolls. She is rather pro-active, as in very approachable, according to Jon. However, today when I see her, she looks quite stuck up leh. Somemore Abang still tell her that my Maths 'ZAI' one, can teach her oso. Kaoz, If I teach her, she better smile man, if not I will charge by the hour man.. Nah haha..       Earlie today I saw 'XIAO HUA' at the kopi tiam. Kaoz, she wore red, and she looks like a big suckling pig from behind sia. And not forgetting to mention that she looks like Ms Tan SingYee from AHQ, total Resemblence. Think Ms Tan looks better. And the sound effect goes : Deng(1) Deng(3) Deng(1) Deng(3)... Guess wat, she was sitting with this poor chap, and he looks quite awkward. Dunno issit because of Xiao Hua's presence or was it that she smelt bad.      I saw Ms charismatic in school again. She is in my lecture group sia.. Lovely. She has got this 'Sei' in her, not that she is chio. She looks OK, but it is her charisma that counts ok. That is my priority NOW, Gals with charisma, and of course, SURE of what she wants. Maybe I should approach her next time. I always see her when I am in school, think it is fate. SIM so big, so many people, how come I dun see the canteen aunty everyday? Good question, maybe that's why, she is my answer to that question.. She is simply oo-lala. Totally different from all other gals in school with double-highlighted hair + super thick foundation + super shiny Lip bump + Posh and stylo Handbags. NO, she is plain, and original. Wonder which day's econs lect she goes to..

            Friends are friends because of BOND. Friends are not friends because one party says so.           Friends are friends when they help you out everytime. Friends are not friends when they leave you high and dry.          Friends are friends because both parties put in effort.     Friends are not friends when any party starts being calculative.          Friends are friends evenwhen crisis hit.     Friends are not friends when they accuse you, and blame you for your fault.          Friends are friends during a crisis.     Friends may not be friends during luxury.          Friends are the most precious because, they trust.     Friends are friends because they care.     Friends are friends because they ARE...

            Today's episode of Singapore Idol was full of emotions. First, you have deaf contestants who wished to have a chance to prove themselves. They're courageous and all that they wanted to do, was to encourage people to go beyond their own barrier to do whatever they yearned to do.           Then we have a single mother, Maia, with a lot of tatoos. First look, I thought she is an ah lian. When she opened her mouth, she sounded very much like any girls from english-teaching school, PERFECT ENGLISH. She insisted that her decision to become a single mother, was right. I will have to bow down to her, for having to bring up her son single-handedly. She has to work real hard to provide for 2 person, and for that I think she joined the contest for a goal in mind.          The contestant who I respected the most, is the malay who sang Clay Aiken's 'Solitaire'. My eyes were quite teary, when they shown the short preview of his life after his father. That song was dedicated to his late father who died last week. He mentioned that the song, perfectly described his late-father's life, and character. I was so mesmerized by the way he sang the song, not because I like that song, in fact I hate that song, but because he sang it with feeling, he sang it with soul. His eyes described how much he missed his dad, and he was on the verged of crying. Now that his father is gone, as the eldest son, he will have to pick up the hard and difficult chore of a disciplinarian, cum breadwinner. So I wish him all the best and may you win the singapore idol..          I feel that all 3 contestants can only be classified as a group of people, the group who is looking for a second chance in their life. A 2nd chance to prove themselves, a 2nd chance to find happiness. Their spirit and mentality are life examples for us to learn from. Their attitude towards life is better than a lot of us. They never bow down to difficulty that can be quite crippling to many of us.           For that, I salute you..

           Well, when Kenney was a soldier in HQ Armour, Kenney met a group of people, I would like to call 'Extincted Species'. Not that they are dead or even that their pictures are in the obituaries, but this group of people meant a lot to me. From the bottom of my heart, I am dead serious Abangs.      This group of people, comes from all walks of life. Some descriptions like these have been used on us : Corporate thinking yuppies, Bengish stylo-wannabies, Unconfident mistake, Sleeping-eyes, Yandaos, Fierce-looking smokers, and of course Hunky-maniacs like me. *Bleh.... Well, the history of LXG goes all the way back, and with our powers combined...... We will have a hearty laugh + hearty smoke + hearty meal + hearty drink = A night full of shit. And of course, we enjoy every single minute of our individuals' companion.      Basically, this group of people helped me a lot, and they dun leave me high and dry when I am in need of advices. They are what I call True Bruddhers Bruddhers. Fun is always the end-product whenever we meetup for a drink at Broadwalk, or Vocal-straining Lung-expanding sessions at KTVs or even babes-watching and shit-clearing on the sand of Sentosa. Though sometimes shit happens when shaunni o'boi is included or if Ivan chooses to bring his Whippets out. Now let me have a thorough introduction and at the same time a dedicated  Memoir  to every members of the group.      The Theorist (Ivan Mun, aka coporate Ivan or Ivanny Mun)    Mr Ivan Mun here is best known for his theories, though not all are 'applicables'. Well, he is like a bowl of ox-tail stew. Only with continuous brewing and slow-cooking, then you will taste his essence. He is the one with the hammer in one hand, a balance in the other and a ciggy is his mouth. Never fails to advise both rationally and nonsensically(as in jokingly, and maybe hornily). Interesting homo-sepian who can always balance the Yins-and-Yangs, but only on one occasion, in which Abang Ivan here will not want me to mention. *Nah haha. Best described as the Corporal who works like an officer, tribute from LTC(NS) Andrew. A very serious worker who never looks at the slip-shot channels of completing a task. Girls are always enticed away from his unusual height by his YanDaoish looks. Usually after the power of his TORQUE, they will either go gaga over him or give out a loud burp after a humongous gulp of cum. Hands down and pants down for the GB man...      The Hulk(Jon Lim Wee Teik, aka Jonnie O'boi or WeLoveLWT)   Abang Jon, a well-respected figure from the very first day I have met him. A charming hunky shell on the outside, that cannot hide his charismatic inside-beauty from the eyes of public. He is like a D24 durian, always satisfying even with a deceiving exterior. And please be warned before you do or say anything in his presence, because you won't like it when he's angry. To identify his status, just look at his colour, Green means you are practically a goner. Imagine... He buys Ginzu knives to cut shoes while watching the afternoon TaiTais' TV programmes. A logical engineer who has crossed over to take on the ever-competitive commercial business studies, which means he can be called a business engineer. Whenever help is needed, just call for him and before you know it, you are on your way home with him, with a few trouble-makers' teeth on the hind seat. If there is trouble, LWT is either there to create it, or to pin it down. He can be labelled as a classmate, or soul-mate, but definitely not a 'stale-mate'. Always feel safe with him around, because, who in the right mind will find trouble with a pair of hulks? TORQUE goes the piston...      The Principal(Billene Lee, aka the bastard or the creator of Bastard School of Thought, BST)   Ah B, who is also the ex-CAO runner, is best known to be the scholar of YanDao Ban. He is like the Mango fruit, too much of it will make your nose bleed. He is like the sticky mango sap, girls' vision are always seen stuck to him. Thanks to him because he introduce my first ciggy to me. Respectable attitude towards life, and we will have to take our hats off to this guy, for his shabbiness in dressing when he goes to town. Imagine white china singlet and khaki berms plus a pair of 'Hawaii' slippers. Does it reminds you of a Chicken Rice Hawker? Well, that quote comes from the theorist, though we do find some resemblence of Zhou Xin Chi. Not to forget his endless bastard stories that never fails to entertain, and even bring out the vengeance in some of us. A serious sense talker, who never fails to share his invalueable opinions. Well-known as a lady-killer, but sometimes kills the wrong target, of course inevitably. Anyone care for a cup of Teh Ni? And of course, no cameras please due to security reasons.      The Stylo(Randy Lee, aka Lan De Li or Super Wedgy)   Fierce De La... Lee Wing Tat, who is the most stylo among the LXGs in terms of dressing, speech, and of course, ACTION. He is like a plate of Black-pepper Stirloin steak, looks appetizing and of course, WELL-DONE. A very responsible worker who never fails to satisfy even the most demanding requests. A role model to look upon to. An underpaid worker who works for up to 16 hours a day, but not compensated rightfully. Although he loves to tease and make fun of me, I never take his words to heart For he and I have been through so much, so much so that our bonding will never be tore apart. A gentle disciplinarian, who guides and teaches along the journey of the LXG's life. The best word that fits him, is like what he says, Magnanimous. Nothing on earth will be so unforgiving to him, other than the sin of taking one's life. A gentlemen who possess a unique taste in choosing gifts and present. However, his unique taste does not restrict to only choosing gifts. His taste is applicable to all aspects, if not he will not be called Randy. If a cup of 'teh ni' were to be spilled, he will be the first to clear up the mess.      The mistake(Shaun Lee, aka Shaunni O'boi or Shun Hua)   *Cher her her her... That is his laughter. OK, that's all, he is like his nick, Mistake(self-explanatory). He is like the Taiwan Sausages, oily and never fails to create a mess after eating. Someone who can flick a cigerrete butt out the front car window, and have the ciggy butt flying in the back window. If you ask me, he has created a deep impression in me, a small chip on my front tooth. It was left during one of our KTVs sessions when he snatched the mike away from me, only to have to mike hitting my poor tooth. Endless mistakes if you ask me. WRONG, if you ask US. Who has ever scotched his friend with a ciggy, wet his friend with beer, and be so generous to pay $20 for parking valet? Even though that is the case, he is our bruddher lah. Because we are so helpless and exposed to his never-ending accidents. Someone who loves tom-yam noodles, and always end up showing his trademark sausage lips to everyone. Not forgetting to mention that he is our KUN SHIN, god of sleeping. The utmost respect will be given to him, if he ever tells MZ that he likes him. Trust me, up till today, he is still holding the torch for MZ. Not that it is for Olympics, but he simply finds joy in doing it. Not a bad combination, Meizhen Siang Bah Kuah + Taiwan sausages = True chinese delicacies.      Ah Yim(Sleepy eyes or what he likes to call himself, the Ahmad)   Yim zai, always with his sleepy eyes. Someone who will always tell me that he needs sleep. If I were to fart, he will say that I am disgusting, but if he were to fart, then it is okay. Best described as a Walnut. Hard on the outside, soft and tasty on the inside. He will use that description on me, if he were to see this. Simply loves putting on a hard front and then crumbles later on. A real gay-in-the-making, who is constantly being molested by me and of course, Chris the cheeky boi. Of course, Yim and I shared many secrets, in fact some of them are DARK SECRETS. A councellor who will only tell me 'Don't think so much lah'. We do share things in common like being pushed around, and sometimes, he pushes me around man. You know... the ganging up with fellow LXGs to 'Dee siao siao' me. There is nothing under the moon, you cannot talk to him about, because he is like NS 5 in I,Robot, he always forgets. A prospective charming lover, who will be seen as the modern ROMEO. Quoting from reliable sources," Not that his jokes are funny, but what matters most is that he tries..."       Now for me to conclude our brotherhood in a few sentence is quite difficult. To avoid complications, I will have to say we are just a bowl of ox-tail stew, a plate of black-pepper stirloin steak, some taiwan sausages, a basket of durians and mangoes and a bag of walnuts for desert. And if you ask me what describes me, I will have to say I am a bowl of congee to go along with the above, because I am simple, yet full of substances. Nah haha, cheers Abangs, Toast to LXGs...

             I have an Ah Lian distant cousin, who told my grandma something. She said I am Yan Dao, and if i get thinner, then I will be perfect. However, I will not commit Incest. Besides, her surname is different from mine, and she is definitely out of the question.  Well, a lot of friends told me to go lose weight and get into shape, and then I will be perfect. However, words are easy, actions are difficult. Sometimes, I think that Xtrim may work. Heard that it actually makes you shit out your fats via your anal passage. Then fat burners do not really work for me. So I guess no pain, no gain, and only hard work will bring success.  In actual fact, it is not that I have not been in my slim days before. I was at my current weight in Sec 3. Then I put in a lot of hard work and discipline, which brought me a cut in weight of 20kgs. My lightest weight was 80kg. Now that I am around my weight in sec 3 before weight regime again, I seriously hope that I can lose weight like last time again. It is quite scarry to know that I put back on so much weight in JC. Kaoz, dun believe it...  I realised Swimming is great, because it burns lots of calories. I have been swimming a lot the past 2 weeks, and what I want to gain is basically : 1) A loss in weight 2) A great Tan 3) A broader shoulder  Think I have achieved a bit of weight loss, and a reasonably good tan. I think I will have to swing my shoulders harder and wider when I swim to obtain objective 3 man.  Moreover, I think I will have to start on my run again. Have not ran since rugby attachment in Jan this year. Hope I will be successful in conditioning and shaping my body. All  I have been doing is Cardio exercises, and I think what is essential as well is to do weights again...   In the midst of finding Kenney's direction in life....

      7th August 2004  Kenneth Tan Yan Xun, a fool for the past 1 year. Cried over spilled milk, and indulging in self-sympathy all the time. All these nonsenses are not worth it. Nobody is in the wrong, and all that had happened were just a small lesson in life. I was wrong, and I sincerely asked for forgiveness from all parties involved...    "Time flies and 1 year has passed, how have I progressed as a human being?", I asked myself today. Simply being childish in my own thinking and making excuses for not progressing in life. Thank god, this year is a year in NS, if not my loss could have been more costly. Time to move on, Kenneth. She is not wrong, it is a choice in life. Treat her as a friend, the next time you see her. Say Hi, and let bygones be brought away with the wind.     I have been stagnant for 1 year, what have I gained? Just many sleepless nights and heart-broken days and nothing else. No Use.... Absolutely No use doing all these. All that I can do to pick myself up is to set my life a new goal, and many targets.  1st Priority : Obtain 1st Class honours in Bsc Accounting and Finance.  3 years down my lifeline, I wonder if i will be able to achieve this? I said I wanted to obtain a Masters? An MBA, with a thesis in what? I do not have any idea yet. Probably sometime later, I will be able to set my goal.  Now that I have retired from rugby, a veteran, I would like to call myself. It is time to get back in shape to a normal human being. I do not need that extra masses no more. No more Scrummages, no more rugs and malls. No more competition in huge masses and weight. Perhaps I will have to re-examine my weight on the 7th of Sep.  Easiest target set : Lose 5 kgs in a month... Do you think you can do it? Take it as a challenge ba...  Continue with your business venture, Kenney. Do not stop half way. You have not earned enough to buy a car yet. Setbacks are inevitable, and you will have to take them as they come along. Instead of shunning away from them. Hope that you will gain a lot more through this wake up call. Re-examine yourself towards your goal in life again next week, to keep yourself on the right track back in the race.  By the way, Thanx Kelvin, You woke me up... If not for you, I might still have been stagnant in my own world of self-sympathy. True friend, great buddy, Buy you dinner 1 day.  PROGRESS KENNETH, You can do it. Exel in life now, if not, you will Never.....!

      Retribution :  deserved and severe punishment (divine, where divination is the skill or act saying what will happen in the future os discovering something that is unknown or secret by magical methods.   I am sure the older generation people will tell most of us in our childhood days that retribution exists, and that if we ever Lie, The moon will slice our tongue away. Whatever the case, I seriously believe in the existance of retribution, and somewhere in this world, there is a governing body that is in charge of retribution. Do a good deed, you will be blessed by unseen good fortunes. Do a bad deed, and rest assured that it will come back to you,  what goes around, comes around.      A friend of mine told me not to be too bothered about my previous relationship. 'She' who has chosen this path, should be prepared to receive retribution in her life. Betrayal is evil, and to betray someone who gives you the fullest trust is Evil. Sad but true. This friend of mine is not immature, she is a 26 yr old mother of 3. Though a bit noisy at many times, what she says really does makes sense sometimes.  On the other hand, Maturity comes with a sensible mentality. No offence, but some girls think that by thinking the same way as them, makes you mature. Maturity is subjective, and it means completely developed both physically and mentally(emotionally) AND to behave in a  responsible  way. For someone to be mature, one has to be responsible for one's actions and words. What you reap is what you have sown. So be responsible to others and be responsible to yourself, account for your actions and words. Never regret what you have said or done, for that is being immature, and retribution may strike for your mistakes one day.  Conclusion : Think before you try to do evil things again, because you never know when retribution will strike you hard...   Kenney, Nah......

          National service is a tomb for relationships. Many relationships ended, while the guys serve the nation. If anyone thinks it is wrong to say such things, please take a walk down to any camp's medical centre, because there are adundent pamplets on '5 easy steps to handling a breakup' for your collection.  Even SAF has gone to the trouble of printing such pamplets for their warriors, one should ponder how is the breakup-rate like in our army these days. So why is the government not doing anything to the 'girlfriend robbers', when the soldiers are commiting suicide for  all these scumbags?  More often than not, the 'girlfriend robbers' will come out with nonsensical philosophy or reasons to try and fend for themselves, but Zao Sai is afterall Zao Sai, don't need to find reasons, philosophy, cock story, bull story to cover up what ever nonsence you and the  gals have created behind the soldiers' backs.  An example will be : "both are still immature to handle a serious relationship that could possibily be built to a marriage", so what makes you cocksters so sure that you are more mature to handle relationships? Whatever is said, is just another more convincing lie to cover up for the mistake commited.  So to the ex-girlfriends who have left your ex-boyfriends during their soldier days, for another guy, GOOD RIDDANCE, because you are the lots who do not survive in terms of hardship. Since you cannot survive a small test like this, what makes you a better candidate in negotiating the tough turns and swirls of the life journey?

              There is a very gray area of whether Zao sai is right or wrong. 'Zao sai' in this context is explained as : A girl leaving her boyfriend  for a new lover . From my personal point of view, I would like to break down the participants into Loyal and Easily-strayed lovers. Now, for all these easily-strayed fellow earthlings, all I can say is, pls go F*** yourself. And it is the male gender of these group that makes the male gender of the Loyal lovers, to feel unsafe for their galfriends to club. Touch your heart, THINK, and Feel. I've got friends who belong to all 4 groups. The rare loyal male party, loyal gal party, the abundant easily strayed males and females.    Thinking for oneself is generally right, needless to say choosing the best alternative. LOVE in this context is rather subjective, reason being : anything you do may be right and may be wrong. There is no right or wrong answers. Besides, there is no governing body to punish the 'wrong' parties. During the period when Guys serve NS, most galfriends step out to the ever-tempting society to start their career. We are all humans, who has never been tempted? Flirtations and Seductions start setting in, gals start considering their options. And when their decision for their future does not contain their current BF, they asked for breakup. I would like to differ from the saying of : "Guys in NS tends to be less confident, more sensitive and very protective against themselves and their surroundings". Because guys in NS have competition among fellow guys too. And it is this competition that makes the guys more determined to progress. Sensitive maybe due to lack of care and concern in Camp, esp when they are yelled at by those M******F****** regulars in camp, guys will tend to start showering concern because they dun wan these treatment to be shown to their love ones(GF).    It is never wrong to choose the Best for oneself, but I would like to strongly urge all lovers, to FEEL more for the opposite parties. Think of wat the opp party will feel, before you do anything. Even till the last minute of your relationship, which is breaking-up, think of how they will feel when you do heartless stuff. E.g: Going into another relationship too fast, will make your ex feel that ur past relationship is quite worthless or that you may have already been cheating behind his back before the breakup. Trust me, I was a victim.    Summarising this article will be a reminder to all that : Having affair with another party after marriage is called ADULTERY(Crime?). So wat makes it right to cheat behind your lovers' back before marriage?

          First day of school was cool, Econs is challenging, and I was a victim of morning bad breath. Bus 61 is a hot item in the morning man, and their biggest pool of consumers are basically Ngee Ann poly Nerds. There was this idiot, who dun seem to talk pride in brushing his teeth in the morning, and i suspect he didn't shower too. He was basically leaning on me through out the journey, like a jelly fish. Everytime, he exhaled, I will have to turn my head away. It smells like a dead rat man, plus his B.O, it makes my 10 mins journey feel like 10 hrs man. The sight of K.A.P was like seeing a mirage in desert. When the crowd starts getting down the bus, I realised they all smell quite alike, less the gals.  Lecture was great, full concentration. As usual, which school got no Ah Lians. There were a few who came in, and did their intro by swaying their hair back. Action Baniaks.. As usual, kenney here can't tolerate all these posers. Think I have an aim for my next 3 yrs in life, FULL CONCENTRATION in studies and get my 1st class honours. No more BGR bullshit man, Kenney's into full-time Studies and nothing more....  Yours sincerely, Kenney the Man..

           Tommorow will be my first day in school yet again. Well, all 'first day in school' feels the same. As usual, I am feeling quite nervous, and quite excited. None of my friends are attending the same lecture with me tommorrow, so I think tommorrow will be a boring day. *Yawn, Had a good saturday outing with my fellow abangs. We saw a bunch of clowns outside cineleisure shouting and each other, over small matters. Jonnie boi told us that the monkeys are friends, and they are Bengs, Loser bengs who cry during their conversation. Nah haha... 'I, Robot' is not bad after all, esp : I'm allergic to Bull-shit. Great quote there by, Will Smith.       Well, let's see if 1st day in school is good experience for me this time round... And the scouting for babes will start... I'll survive!
