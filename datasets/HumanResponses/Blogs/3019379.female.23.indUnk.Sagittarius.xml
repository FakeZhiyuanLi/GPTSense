      after i went to see harry potter, i walked over to virgin and bought this cd.  i read something about it in rolling stone and was curious about the loretta lynn/jack white collaboration.  so...i downloaded the title track a couple of days ago and fell in love.  i've always really enjoyed country music because, while growing up, my dad always used to make us listen to marty robbins, patsy cline, and anne murray in the car.  i'm sure my brother and i can sing along, word for word, to more country classics than your typical filipino twenty-something.  and as for loretta lynn, i fell in love with her story since i saw coal miner's daughter on cable just a few years ago.  she even talks about the movie in a funny way in 'story of my life'.  i love music that tells a story, which is why i love country, and this album is everything i like.  it's meaningful, happy, sad, angry, even inspirational with 'god makes no mistakes'.  and there's a duet --  what more can i ask for?  country duets are the best and jack white adds raw-ish rock twist in 'portland, oregon', which is even better.  all i can say about van lear rose is BUY IT....NOW!!!!

      i just got back from seeing the new harry potter flick.  i'm a big fan of cuaron's other films as well as the former harry potter movies, so i admit i was excited to see it.  i can't believe i waited this long to see it -- it was amazing.  it's obvious that a new director has come into the life of harry potter.  in some scenes. i swear harry looks just like gael garcia bernal too.  but, the sequel was much darker than the past films, as well as much more mature.  unfortunately i have only read the first book, but to my understanding the books are maturing as well.  the cast is definitely older and have grown in their acting abilities.  they also dress much better this time around.  i enjoyed myself and can honestly say that a few scenes actually had me scared and at the edge of my seat.  the special effects exceeded my expectations as well.  there was one scene in particular, where harry takes a ride on the hypocrite...i wish the neverending story had effects this good.  i'd love it even more!  however, leaving the theater, i questioned whether the next sequel will be appropriate for a younger audience.  i can tell when i like a movie because while i'm watching it i think to myself that i wish it would never end.  i felt this way with this movie.  i'm a big fan of all the harry potter movies, and speaking for myself, i love the darker path it's taking.

      rented this movie at blockbuster last friday and i still haven't returned it.  i've seen it four times since then.  this is exactly the type of film i enjoy watching.  it's about finn, a train enthusiast who inherits a train depot in a quaint little town.  he's a loner who doesn't like to say much. yet, when he moves into the depot, he instantly meets joe - a pushy nonstop talker who is eager to befriend the new neighbor.  then there's olivia who's son passed away and is in the process of divorce.  the entire movie is the three of them just hanging out, talking -- and not talking.  olivia has her spats with depression and there are minimal romantic interludes between herself and finn.  the story could have easily been made into your typical romantic-comedy, but it wasn't.  what i enjoyed most is that the station agent ended up being about friendship.  strange and awkward friendship -- but friendship nonetheless.  the entire movie was nice and quiet, the art direction was amazing, and the acting -- phenomenal.

      i recently went to see the new movie "imelda" at the century lanmark.  it' a documentary about the former phillippine first lady, imelda marcos.  i laughed hysterically throughout.  it's just strange when some people are placed on a pedastal by everyone around them, they really believe they are superior.  imelda marcos did some strange things for the camera in this movie.  the most mind-boggling had to have been her philosophical discussions on peace + order.  she seemed as if she thought she was albert einstein discussing relativity.  very strange.  needless to say, the entire theater was in uproar everytime she would attempt to explain.  i heard somewhere that she is suing the filmmaker for portraying her negatively and tainting her reputation.  since i was i child, raised in a filipino household, i have always been told that the marcos' were the downfall of the phillipines.  watching this as an adult only solidifies that belief.

      i just downloaded the soundtrack to 'a walk to remember' -- i hart this movie.  granted, many people think this movie is extremely cheesy.  i like it a lot.  i have this weird attraction t o mandy moore.  although i absolutely despise her when she was a blonde, i like the brunette in her.  'only hope' is a great song, but 'cry is even better.  in my opinion, MM  is a cool chick.  after seeing 'saved' a couple of weeks ago, i'm convinced that this teeny-bopper is capable of so much more.  go see 'saved' it's awesome and very 'waters-ish'.  it's a joke gone very well.  "you're not born a gay, you're born again!!!!"
