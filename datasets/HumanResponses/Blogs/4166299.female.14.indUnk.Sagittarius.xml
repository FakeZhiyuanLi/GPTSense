      I knew a dumb blonde that was so stupid that....   -she called me to get my phone number  -he spent 20 min. looking at the orange juice box b/c it said concentrate  -she put lipstick on her forehead b/c she wanted to make up her mind  -he tried to put M&Ms in alphabetical order  -she sent me a fax with a stamp on it  -she tried to drown a fish  -she thought a quarter back was a refund  -she got locked in a grocery store and starved to death  -she tripped over a cordless phone  -she took a ruler to bed to see how long she slept  -she asked for a price check at the dollar store  -she studied for a blood test  -she thought meow mix was a record for cats  -when she heard that 90% of all crimes occured around the home, she moved  -when she missed the 44 bus she took the 22 bus instead  -when she went to the airport and saw a sign that said "Airport left" turned around and went home

      ok so here's my joke of the day.... i didnt make it up though....my friend sent it to me....i hope ya enjoy it.... There are five guys on a plane and the plane is about to crash. There are only four parachutes, so the first guy is Kobey Bryant. He says, "I think I deserve to live b/c im a big part of my team." So they all decide to give him a parachute. The next guy is Arnold Schwartzenneger. He says, "I'm a big part of California and i think i deserve to live, besides im a very good actor too." So they all decide to give him a parachute. The next guy is the smartest man on earth. He says,"I'm so smart it would be a shame if I died, so I think I deserve to live!" So without them deciding he just ran and grabbed one and hopped out of the plane. The last two people were a pope and a rabbi. The Pope said, "You can go, I'm already 85 years old. I'll risk my life for you." The rabbi then said,"No its okay we can both go." The Pope then asked,"Why?" The rabbi then said,"The smartest man on earth grabbed my talit bag as he was jumping off the plane."
