      I am so fucked!!! Once again! i tried signing up for GRE test. itonly offers freaking Subjects tests this fall in US. Gosh, i don't want the subjects test. i want fucking general test only!!!!!!!!! shit! i may have to just take freaking computer science subjects test. other disappointment: there is no October test, just November and so on. barely get my scores in at end of December.  Did i do something i wasn't supposed to? ok besides the little stuff, i meant something really Mean to someone? Why is this happening to me? ------------------------------------------ since i'm all angered, i mind as well degrade myself and show my weakness. I am so freaking upset and i guess jealous. i have not been so fucking jealous since the younger years. i'm going back to the ex-friend who out of nowhere is getting paid more than me now and she only has a high school diploma (barely).  my boss offers me a job as management BUT i need a degree (which i do) AND the fucked up part is that the low end starts at $23.41/hr. the high end starts at $29.88/hr. And when i say offered, i mean nothing fucking official. haven't seen it yet and its been months.  now, my ex-friend(no life, no ambition, no education, no experience (under my terms), no professionalism ) gets a job that requires ONLY 5 years of experience in a general area AND HS diploma. I could've easily applied for it but being i am still fucking waiting..... anyhoo, she gets paid $22/hr. ALSO, she was picked over someone with more experience and education, now theres MIS-Management for you. They picked her because she kisses ass and they know her more than the other person.  this makes a fucking joke of me! working my ass off to get this job that someone with the heart and brain of an ant can also get. When does paid for performance come in? for work? for life? God, how does that work in with life? Satisfaction/goodness for efforts/hardwork you put in.  HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN? WE WORK FOR THE SAME COMPANY. HOW DOES ONE JOB EXPECT MORE AND PAY JUST AS LESS AS ANOTHER WHICH EXPECTS LESS?????? HOW!!!!!?????  thats where my jealousy stems from. besides that, my ex-friend is going to love being closer to me so she can torment me. i hate it. i could easily file a sexual harrassment lawsuit on her. i've got one proof and one theory. damn bitch!  okay, hows that for honesty? am i really jealous? i'm confused. i think i am a little bit, just a little bit jealous but more upset because she gets to torment me and upset at the system.  I AM BETTER THAN SHE'LL EVER COME CLOSE TO.  God, give me strength to not allow this person to annoy me in the early dawn of my sleep and make me have to get up and blog.  okay-i'm feeling better now, i'm going to breathe and never mention this again on here. it will all be over as soon as i discuss it with my boss. i really am better. the curse words tend to give off more heat than intended. but is that really true? hmm. okay, no more about this.

      God, am I the bad guy? Why am I getting the short end of the stick? I was so happy for a while until now. Is this a test? I will pass it but  I have so much frustration and anger right now.  You sent me your Son and I'm so glad I've found my way to both of you! I know you hear my prayers. I know you feel what I feel. I want strength and I want courage. I want to see Jesus again. I love the feel of no fear, no anger, the feel of warm embrace, warm light and pure unconditional love.......... I remember you sent him because I called onto you. Come back to me.  Show me the way.  Amen.

       I called it in to the secretary. taking a sick day. Sick of people who don't do jack and get paid, sick of working and not getting recognized, sick of work politics, sick of mis-managment. damn, here i go again. okay, just read my previous post. i'm not going to dwell on them.  today is catchup for me. bills to pay, people to call, movies to catch up on, and internet. awesome day it will be.  definitely, i'm signing up for GRE and CBEST today. thats about $100 for both, i think.  got paid yesterday. damn, paid all my bills due this week and i still got money left over.. i double checked it. can't believe it. it better not come back and slap me in the ass.

      Blogger.com, you guys need to make a search feature.   It will definitely kill my bored moments (like now) when I get bored of typing blogs and clicking&nbsp; to Dashboard to check out my name on the recently updated list. It gets boring after the 4th time.  &nbsp;

      i'm taking time off of work. i'm 100% paid for performance and this job isn't cutting it.   it seems to me the lazy ones who give less than 5% from day one, get recognition when they show 10% of work. Here i am giving 100% from day one and now they expect it.   TIP TO ALL: act stupid. if they know you're smart they expect it. There is less expectations when you act&nbsp;stupid (hopefully you're&nbsp;not really stupid and its just all a show)&nbsp;which means less work and fucking recognition when you actually work.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      i just found out today my freaking ex-friend who is a genuine lowlife-low self esteem psycho is getting paid more than me and will be working at the same site as me. IT WAS ALL FUCKING MISMANAGEMENT!! who has the flipping education here? who is more professional and more experienced in the workfield? ME!   first of all , i'm not upset she's getting more than me. i only say those things because&nbsp; its part of another issue at my workplace. i'm upset she's at the same address as me.&nbsp; She is crazy! i mean empty inside but filled with evil thoughts crazy.   identity thief. she wants to be like me. she took all my previous jobs after i've been promoted. she emails me with sexual harrasment. she spreads rumors about me. she called my husband and told him i was fucking someone. she wants to take me down because i am better and she'll never get to happiness like me.  best part, she's commented on how nice my ass is and she is a bisexual. she really WANTS me but since she can't have me, she'll rest on stalking me.   and i'm not a lesbian.   she likes to chew revlon nail polish and thinks of the perfect crime on raining weekends. this is why i'm so afraid she'll do something to my car or house.   damn mismanagment. they hired her because the other person (&nbsp;who is well educated ) was not on their "In-Crowd" list.   &nbsp;

      so i saw my chiropractor. he says i'm developing a ... damn, whats the word.... a.......... damn! anyhoo, something like arthritis in one of my neck bones. i need to see him 4 times a week and put ice on my neck.   what else..hmmm...&nbsp; &nbsp;i have an arch to archy in my lower back. that explains my big ass! well.. actually nice size but.. anyhoo.. back to my back. on the last back bone, the joint inbetween the two is too small.. maybe no joint at all. not normal. thats explains why i'm short.&nbsp; missing 1/2" of joint goo.&nbsp; "birth defect" he says. thanks dr.  anyhoo, of course i want to be better. i'll go for better health, long life. besides insurance is paying for it due to the accident. its all good besides my lack of good sleep or sleep......period.  Thank you God and Jesus for the fact that i can still walk, breathe, eat normally and have full use of my five senses!  amen.  &nbsp;

      never get into an accident. of course because of safety/health issues but also if you survive it, the doctor visits and "WHO is Paying??" is such a hassle! NEVER PAY OUT OF POCKET EITHER.  it took me almost 1 hrs to do paperwork and crap of who is paying. finally, we got it all settled. my friends insurance will cover my expenses and then they insurance will go after the other guy.  damn.. i'm feeling headaches. need.....................rest................................

      damn, i'm all sore. my back. my shoulders. my neck. my chest.  i threw up dinner last night. was it from the accident? my first thought was actually "pregnant?". i tested. i wasn't. good. because the impact from the accident would've made me very upset if i was pregnant.   anyhoo, this morning, as i type (you read), my right arm (mostly), is feeling numb. what the hell is it!??  ughh.. i hate to be reminded of an accident. this shit better go away!   last night i slept on my left side and there was this sharp pain at my lower left side. pulsating pain.   i'm going to see the chiropractor this morning. damn shit!

      ughhh.. my back hurts. i got into an accident today.  co-workers and i were going to lunch. we were on the left lane and the car infront of us was turning left so she came to a stop. my friend, the driver, came to a stop also. 2 seconds later, BAM!!! BAM!!! and there was smoke in the air from the air bags. some idiot rear ended us at a very good speed. i was in the back seat passenger side. my other friend, who was&nbsp;in the passenger side, and i were both in shock. my friend, the driver, was very upset because this may be like the 5th accident in 2 years, all not her fault, and the second cadillac she's had. she got out of her car and went to bitch out the guy who hit us. his reply to her was, "you stopped in the middle of the street". well, yes, because there was a car infront of us turning. had his idiot ass paid attention, we'd all be fine!  on-star came on. there was also a detective who was around when it happened. he directed traffic so we could move out of the street safely. police man came. took report. took names.  my friend, the driver, got her left thumb smashed. maybe be from the airbag. my other friend had her legs crossed at the time so her impact was harsh. her left leg was bruised. the seat belt squeezed on her during impact. her left hip was hurting along with her back. i felt shock. i had numbness and tingling around my face and all over my body, mostly my hands. i was scared.   the two girls went on the ambulance. i went back to work with a staff, who came over after we called him. i picked up my car and went to my doctor. i started feeling pain on my left side:leg, arm, neck. then there was more pain around my lower head and neck area.&nbsp;6 hrs later and i'm feeling pain along my lower back and shoulders. i made an appointment to see my chiropractor tomorrow.  i had to get the claim # from my friend and i also need her insurance policy. anyhoo, i hope everyone is ok.  now for the twilight zone moment: last year 4 days from today, we all had gotten into an accident with a county car also going to lunch.   as for my friends: as stated previously, the driver--> this is her 5th accident within 2 years the passenger--> this is her 3rd accident of the year.   next time we go to lunch, i'll meet them there.  as for me, i'm hoping this whiplash does not come back every so often to remind me of the today's accident.  thank you God for watching over us so that we can continue to breathe.

      Today was so boring at work. I'm effective as always but just tired. overworked and underpaid. i got myself an office and new furniture but no promotion yet. maybe that's why i'm so bothered and upset. the promise of a promotion that may not take place anytime soon.   I think i'm going to work on my rubiks cube at work during my downtime. got to get a hold of some algorithm and apply it in hopes of getting all the damn colors back on each side. Its do-able. Just have to have patience and i think a brain is needed for the algorithm.  What a goal! i'll be figuring out the cube in my dreams, i'm sure.

      I decided Thursday that i am going to forget GRE, forget going back for my Masters......FOR NOW, and take a dive into Real Estate. Its hot here! And i'm grabbing my piece of the pie while its hot! We have a new U.C. coming in 2005, houses are appearing out of nowhere, the city is expanding in all directions. Supply and demand is screaming at each other. ppl from the Bay are buying homes here. Besides, i plan on selling my own home when my 2 year mark comes up and that's next year Christmas 2005.  I won't quit my current job though. i plan on starting real estate part time, then depending on how it goes, i'll contract for my services at my current job. i know they'll do contracted services because i have my competitive edge and they need that.  I am successful in most things that i do, so i have a clear picture of what i will get out of this career. I only plan on doing this for about 2 years.   my motivation is my drawing plans of a nice home on acres, landscaped with japanese garden and a fish pond, a nice huge library and a indoor rock climbing area in the house. It's going to be awesome.   i'm so damn materialistic. next week, i'm prepping for the test. ambition is such a wonderful thing! Its what drives me to the next level.  wish me success!

      Truth is that I have a promotion lined up. It'll happen before this year is over (Fingers crossed).  Anyhoo, my boss made a compliment today: "It'll be a challenge but with you leading the charge I'm sure things will go smooth." That made my day.   My reply was "Should I go Hitler now or wait until everyone returns from vacation?"  She told me to wait.   Moral of the story: There's a new Hitler in town and she ain't blonde blue-eyed. Goes by the name of BITCH.

      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I got a new car stereo the other day in my car as the other one broke, and it has voice activation software installed into it!  If you say, "Rock!" it switches the settings to play rock music!   If you say "Classical", it switches settings and plays Classical music!   On my way home last night some kids ran out in front of my car.   I hit the brakes and yelled "F*cking Kids" and the radio started playing Michael Jackson. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       Real Estate a Job for Me?  My good friend starting working in March and up-to-fucking-date she has made $80 grand. Now how stupid am I to be sitting my ass here and not taking a dive myself? Pure Logic comes to mind. I think it may be that I am scared and I think about my fucking $2000 mortgage and my other bills.......oh! and food. I'm thinking about doing it anyways sometime down the line because i plan to sell my home in 2 years by myself.    GRE  I'm taking the GRE test so now I have to shape up and get back into studying. I've been so laxed for the summer, its miserable (in respect of the GRE). ughhhh... unfortunately procrastination won't work in this deal for me. btw, i'm a procrastination at heart when it comes to school. The GRE looks terribly hard. What kind of words are contumacious, peregrination, loquacious, munificence. People don't use these words!!! not me anyways. ugghh.. and MATH!! i'd forgotten how to do math. of course i had to take Calculus for my major but that was a long time ago. I find myself forgetting, at times ONLY (not all the time), what 8X7 may be. My son usually will confirm or make an idiot of me with the answer. God help me thru this one!

      I knew you listened, God!  My boss tells me they will place my ex-friend at another location! Halleluja! (or however you spell it). I feel good. I realize now that all that smack i talked about her getting paid more than me was mask. i was really hating on her being anywhere close to me. she's locust, leech.  anyhoo, back to the stuff that counts in life... my friends and I went to the bar after work. i was only able to take down half of my margarita. i had an empty stomach and that made things bad. Then i totally forgot there was a birthday party i had to go to. Just got back a few minutes ago. damn eye contacts still bugging me. must be the wind. its so dry.  Got Paypal?

      I have my eye contacts on and they are annoying the crap out of me.  anyhoo....  what happened today? watched  13 going on 30  at work today. played at work today. didn't work at work today. the beauty of it all is that i have my own office. ha! so nice sometimes. i hope my boss never reads these posts. i'd be in alot of trouble.  i went to the tattoo store. so rude. after looking at the samples they had, i waited at the register to ask some questions. a kid walked right passed me. it'll be a while until i go back. i didn't find what i wanted anyways: too flashy, colorful and juvenile. its true, you tell more people about bad experiences than you do good experiences.   i just found out today that sleeping on your stomach is a no-no. especially for my neck after my accident. i never knew it was bad. its so comfortable at times though.

      As I browse thru the recently published blogs, I'm thinking what annoys me the most is when ppl type using lower case and uppercase in one word alternating in no freaking order giving them an impression of a gangsta/punk rock profile. how annoying. actually.. more like how high school. sorry if i offend my friends who do this.  i used to do this myself. what an idiot i was in my younger years. off the topic a bit but i used to wear baggy ass jeans and wear dark lipstick and throw dumb ass signs thinking i was all bad. God, how pathetic i was.   o! i just remembered.. totally off the topic... i was smoking at work with the ladies. they laughed their asses off at how i held the cigarette. this marks my second attempt of smoking. once back in the younger gangsta days and now. believe it or not, my love is second hand smoking. and yes, i'm aware i'll die faster.. thats why i don't intentionally go out to do it. however, it must be like when ppl have a fetish of smelling stinky toes or something. LOL.... read this correctly. i'm not saying i like smelling toes. i'm saying it must be like that.

      I think there are ghosts in my house. (twilight zone music.....) Its a new home and we've been here 7 months now. I feel different now.   perhaps the second month, i saw this white figure coming out of the garage as we were coming home. I thought it was my husband and I said something to it. It took maybe 2 seconds for me to realize it wasn't him. But I wasn't scared. Felt like it was watching over our house or us. From that point on, i believe if you saw something at the corner of your eye, you did see something.  Now its different. now i feel something. nothing evil.. i hope. yesterday i thought i saw something and i'm afraid i did.   Why do they hide under the bed or in the closets or in dark places? My sister in law has the gift to see ghosts. She says they sometimes test her to see if she sees them. They would sneak up on her and see if she reacted. Spooky.   She says everything in The Sixth Sense is true. Scary shit, if you ask me.

      returned back to work. it was alright. talked to my boss about my exfriend. Boss said i should've told her before. The situation would've been much better than now. i agree. but who knew she was gonna get hired. They will try to find her another location. Worse case, i gotta suck it up and watch my ass. This is all in the past now in THREE..................TWO.....................ONE.  okay, new topic.  anyhoo, i didn't turn on the A.C. today. kind a hot. i'm really feeling like taking my top off. getting sweaty here. i'll turn on the fan.

      took another sick day. i didn't want to go back to work. went fishing with the family instead. caught one striper.   i actually wanted to clean house or decorate kitchen but didn't. i've been thinking about going out to buy a religious book so i can read about God and Jesus.   nothing much happened.

      Cancer's horoscope for today.....  "Remember that you don't always have to echo the opinions of those whom you admire. Someone will greatly respect you for speaking your own mind. Be careful when dealing with others, as a miscommunication is very possible. So long as you keep your eyes and ears wide open, you should be able to calm a storm before it gathers momentum. Others may seem aloof, but realize that it may just be that Cancer sensitivity coming to the forefront. Since family is important at this time, rather than letting your feelings be hurt, retreat instead with the ones you love. No one else really needs to know about your internal conflict. Put it behind you, and move forward."  only rare occasions when horoscopes sometimes do match up with your life.
