      I have a dream to live comfortable and to have some toys. I want a life that I don't have to worry about money. I want to live the easy life, when I need something I can just go get it, nothing to big like a car. Just the little things, like if my kids want a big swimming pool I can get it and it won't matter how big it is.  I want to move out of the trailer court and have a pretty big house not to big, I don't like to clean a big house just enough rooms so the kids have big bedrooms and when my step-daughter comes over for the weekend she has her own room and doesn't have to share with my daughter.  I want to travel some day, and right now money is stopping us and if I get a good paying job, then my husband can slow down and be able to spend more time with us. He can have a couple days off or even vacation time, so that we can go out and play like a family should when theres enough money.  I want to be setting really good. I kind of now in some ways, but in other ways we don't, we sometimes live pay check to pay check and I don't want to live that way any more. If my husband got hurt and couldn't work for awhile I might have to quit school and get a job. I want to have enough money so if he did get hurt then we don't have to worry and maybe I can work at home, so I can take care of him.

      I would say what bothers me is why do we collect candles and never burn them. We go around&nbsp;smelling them and they smell so good that you want to buy them and you never burn them and&nbsp;all they do is collect dust. I'm a victim in this candle scam; I think that they make them smell so good for us to buy. I have tos of candles and I think I have only burned about six of them.  The bottom of my entertainment center is covered with them and I don't know why I actually buy them for. My husband even says that I have too many. I have to buy buy them! I don't&nbsp;understand why I buy them and I have been to other people's houses and they have the same amount or more then I do and they&nbsp;don't burn them, too. They turn out to be knickknacks if anythingelse. Maybe, we think that they are a smoothing thing and we need that in our live, something to help us settle down from a hard day at work, college, and even our teenage kids. I think it relaxes us; they make them with potpourri so we can relax.&nbsp;

      Tracy Olson  College Writing 1  Julie Lundblad  July 20, 2004  Write About a Family Event.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The day that Tracy and the kids arrived was my best day in my life. I remember Tracy when she was a little girl and she gave up her bed for me when she was about 5 years old. She has grown up and became a wonderful mother to my first great-grandson and the great-granddaughter she named after me. I hope that they enjoy it here in California. This is her first time here and the first time she will always remember me, she has told me that all she remembers about me is that if she was sleeping on the couch that meant grandma was coming.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that I stay healthy enough to visit, because this will probably be her only chance to see me again. I haven’t been feeling well lately so I hope the memories will always be with my granddaughter and great grandchildren. This was the best birthday gift I could ever receive. Now, I got to see my first great-grandson and boy is he a great kid she’s doing a great job and my great granddaughter that is named after me and her grandma’s middle name. Tracy told me if she knew my middle name she would have named Laura completely after me, but I told her that her mother’s middle name Marie was nice too and that was a good combination.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I seen them off today they are going to Disney Land and then the next day they are flying back home. I hope her stay was great, I know it was great seeing her all grown up and she got to meet her cousins for the very first time. I can’t believe my eyes on how much my grandkids have grown and Tracy with a family. Things seem to be going good with Tracy she has found a good man and she and the kids seem like they have survived the divorce well. I hope she knows how much I love her and proud of her. I hope the memories will stick with the great-grandkids. On July 7th I passed away and I was happy to meet my great-grandkids and see my granddaughter all grown up with her little family. I can go in peace knowing that she is finally happy and I got the chance to see her and the kids.

      Tracy Olson  College Writing 1  Julie Lundblad  July 20, 2004  Write About An Opposite And Combined Them Together.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cell phone is the greatest thing that they invented you can carry it with you and you’ll never miss a call if that person has your number. If you get stranded somewhere there is not phone to get to right away. One of the problems with having a cell phone is the fact you are always getting calls and driving and some of these people can’t talk on the cell phone and drive at the same time.  &nbsp;Having a regular phone is great to have you don’t have to worry about going over your minutes. You can chose different styles that you want there is the phone that has caller ides and answering machine all in one or just a plan Jane phone. You can get you phones in different shapes you can have Garfield or a shoe for a phone.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      We spontaneously thought it would be a good idea to go camping on Saturday. I have been waiting for&nbsp; two years to go camping my husband would always say "We are going camping this weekend." We FINALLY went and it was good every one in the family helped set up the tent and get the fire going to cook our hotdogs and the couple fish that my son only caught, he was happy because he really doesn't like hotdogs.  &nbsp;  I have never had so much fun camping this time, when I was a kid that's all we did was camp out we never lived in a home in the summer we only lived in a home when we were in school. I can't remember when we ever lived in a house. Our house was the tent that was set up in the KOA camp grounds or a old logging trail which ever one my father wanted to go to.  &nbsp;  I never liked camping when I was a kid and my kids had fun and that made me happy. My proud son got to drive our Explorer and he did good according to my husband.

      I would say the time I felt ambivalence was when I first meet my second husband at the time I thought I could handle this and then at times I thought should I get involved with someone, I was only divorce for&nbsp;about 6 months when I meet him. I wondered a lot about if my kids felt okay with me being with another man. I know that that they didn't want me back with their father.  &nbsp;  Then, I thought maybe I should tell him I don't want anything the do with him and to leave then on the other hand he was a good man, he listened to what I had to say and he didn't tell me that I was stupid or that I couldn't think that way. I wanted to be with someone and then I wanted to feel the freedom I never had with my first husband. I lived like a prisoner.  &nbsp;  I wanted to share my day with him and then I thought we could just be friends and how does a man and women do that my ex use to say that was impossible. It think people can have a friend that is the opposite sex without being lovers.

      I think if you asked this question to all different ages you would get a lot of different answers. I think that most of your teenagers would say "YES". Then, they can buy everything that they want so that they can fit in with the rest of the crowd. If you asked some of your adults they would say "NO". I think money honestly changes people more then making them happy.  &nbsp;  I don't think money can buy happiness what happens when you run out of money. I would say if anything it changes people in the way they look at society. You have those that were kind and happy with where they are and then they get more money then they had before they think they're better then the next person. I only want to live comfortable, I wouldn't want more then that. I'm happy now and I don't think I would be happy with more money. I like the idea that I earned the money to buy what I want.

      All I can say about tomatoes is that it is my daughter's favorite fruit or vegetable. I don't think people have decided if thats a fruit or vegetable. She loves them so much, but when she eats certain ones they give her a thing on her mouth that looks like a cold sore. I always and sometimes forget to tell them at Burger King no tomatoes on my whopper because I know she loves them. At Burger King their tomatoes don't bother her.  I like the smile she gets when she see tomatoes. She gets so excited that I think she could jump out of her skin. I wish she would like other foods like that. The only time I really like tomaotes is when I eat B.L.T's. My son takes the tomatoes out and my husband just plainly doesn't order that sandwich, he can eat them on a whopper. I think she's the only one in the family that likes them. So every once in awhile I will buy them tomatoes for her, i like buying special things like that for my family. When, I was kid I liked them with suggar, but I'm not going to introduce that sugar thing to her! I hope she enjoys them when she grows up.

      I feel that I have improved in learning how to be more specific on what I want to say. I give more effort on my writing now that I have a teacher that cares to help me and others that have troubles writing. I don't like to write, but I feel comfortable writing now.  I can decribe things alnog with keeping it short. I have a different outlook on writing, but I still wouldn't want to do it for a living! I actually look forward t0 coming to class, when you have teacher that is tough but also caring it helps the writer. Then , you have more confidence about yourself on writing a paper or essay.

      I think that all places should be acessible to every one, why not. I was angery when I was reading Limited seating On Broadway, when the house manager came and told him to leave. Why can't he see the show and they sold him the tickets knowing that he was in a wheelchair, so they should of told him then that they had a policy for disabled patrons. I feel that any one that pays for a show or movie should be accessible for the handicapped.   They are as equal as we are that are not handicap. I know now there are places that are pretty much equipped for the handicap. In Montana were I used to live, there was this lady that would go around places to see if they were accessible and then she would get a petition going so that they would make it accessible to any one.

      I would have to say sometimes divorce can be bad. My parent's got a divorce when I was about 11 years old. It was hard on my brother and I because we lived in Montana and my mom lived in Colorado and we wanted badly to live with her and we didn't want to live with my dad. When, he got us back to Montana he changed and became a mean person. Before that he was nice. Then, he was never around for us just for supper time was the only time he had for us.  Now, if you ask my 13 year old son he would say that when his dad and I divorced was the best day of his live. He told me when I got back from getting my divorce he said to me "It was about time that you left him." My children have always supported me on my divorce. The only thing that botters them is the fact that their dad only gives them the phone calls, but he won't see them. He told them before that if he has to pay child support then he will never see them. He says he shouldn't have to pay to see them. Some parent's don't think how bad they destroy kid's when they are not in their lives.

      It is so peacful and you can see the eagles and other birds flying by to see if they can find come food. It must be their feeding. I love it out here, the ski is very blue and no clouds in the ski, the only thing that is in the ski are the birds flying and the sun smiling at you. I enjoy the trees more than I did the mountains in Montana and Colorado. People say that I'm crazy for not missing the mountains, but I feel comfortable with the trees. I love the sound of the children swinging off the trees into the lake. Some are laughing while they are jumping in or just standing my the shore line.  I love the sound of the children while their tubing or water skiing. I feel so relaxted in the boat and I always forget that I'm deathly afraid of the water, I actually don't even think about the fear. Maybe, I don't need to have any fear because I know if I fall in my husband will be right behind me to save me. He introduced me to this wounderful place we any chance we can. I love fishing even if I don't catch anything, its more a relxation thing and also I can have some special time with my husband without the interruption of the world and my son loves it too. Maybe one day when my daughter is a little older she will enjoy it like the rest of us do.  My daughter doesn't like it but when she has to come with and the sun fish or pan fish are bitting, then she has fun. When she gets older she will appreciate the outdoors more. Right now she's into having friends over and playing with her bratts dolls and baby dolls. My husband hopes that when she grows older pretty much in her teens that she will like the outdoors like her brother. I hope she will think the same ways as I do about the lakes, trees, and watching the birds fly by or even stop to eat.

      I would say that when you do something well it gives you a great feeling. With being a parent to two great kids, if feels good when you hear them tell you they love you. I feel good when I help in my daughter's class room and just seeing her big smile and her being proud that I'm there to help. She is so proud to have me be there with her and the kids enjoy me being there.   I feel good when my kid's friends come over and are happy to see me and tell me that I'm one of the best parents they ever meet. They have fun being themselves, they laugh and do things over here that they can't do at home like have water fights in the house or outside, and yes I did say inside. There is one girl that loves being here. She lost her mom two years ago to cancer and she told me that she loves me as if I was her mom and that she feels that she can talk to me and that makes me feel good.   A couple days before Mother's Day, she asked me if she could get something for me on Mother's Day. I didn't know what to say and I did say that yes. There are no words how to descibe how proud that child felt. She's grounded for quite awhile and she calls and tells me she misses me and that no one understands her at home like I do. I'm glad that I can make a difference in a teenager's life.

      I would have to say were I go for my escape from reality is fishing on the lake with our boat. I don't have to rush to get some where or have to run here and there for my kids or husband. The fish don't bug you like the kids and husband. The fish don't know our names, so you don't hear "mom or "sweety". I like the relaxation that you get when you go fishing. It's nice to sit there and feel the breeze and the only sound you hear are the other people in the boats finding their spots to fish or the kids haveing fun on the tubes or water skiing.  I feel that nothing can bother me here and I can enjoy God's creation that man has not destroy for the society. I feel relaxed and don't worry about anything just to out fish my husband and son and sometimes thats hard with my son. We actually laugh more here too, they like seeing me squirm when they ask for the worms and leeches.

      I was about 16 years old when I went to live with my mom and step-dad. I never really had a Christmas when I lived with my dad and all he could afford was two presents each for my brother and me. That year that I moved in with my mom, I had the biggest Christmas ever. It was so huge that when I wake up I honsety thought I woke up in a different home. That Christmas tree was very much so pregnant that I went back to bed and went to sleep and thought this time I will wake up and this time I will be in the right house. To my suprise, I was in the right house that tree didn't change at all!  I was working at McDonald's at the time so I had some money to buy presents for my family, that was great. I love to shop for people I have no problems getting them things. I think that is why Christmas is my favorite holiday, because I can buy presents for people and I can make them happy. I like Christmas now, that I have kids it great to see their smile and excitment on Christmas morning.

      It is very dark and I am alone in a bed in the middle of a room. I can't see anything but the area right around my bed. I am freezing cold and I don't have enough blankets to stay warm. I notice that someone is coming towards the bed. Then someone else and then another person. I never can see their faces but they get close enough to steal my blankets from my bed. Once they have taken them, they begin to use them like they are a jumprope. They turn them over and over again. I am laying there freezing to death wondering why they took my blankets. I can not stop shaking and shivering, I am so cold. It is so dark and I don't understand what is happening. I watch them twirling my blankets. All of a sudden I notice that my blankets have actually turned into a rope. The people, or whatever they are, slowly fade into the  dark back round as they continue to twirl the rope or what used to be my blankets. I wake up because I am so cold.   This is a dream that I have had ever since I was a child. It seems that when I am sick with a fever or not feeling well, I will dream this dream. I have gotten to the point that when I am not feeling well, I sometimes worry about "the dream". Even though it is harmless, I still wonder where it comes from.

      Every family has imperfections. On August 9, 1982, our wonderful imperfection was born. From the moment our son was born, we knew that he was not the "perfect" baby. We were told that he had downs syndrome. He had many health problems that were of great concern. No one knew what the prognosis for our son was. Of course we were devastated. The fear of the unknown was the worst.   Weeks later we were told that the tests for downs syndrome were negative. What was wrong with our baby. In between doctors visits and hospitalizations, we started to realize that there was something very precious about our son. We soon realized that life revolved around his schedule, not ours. That was good for everybody because we stopped "scheduling" things like we had been used to. We learned to just take things as they came. We took more time to sit and cuddle with our son's. We had to sit and rock one so it gave us the time to also read or talk to our other son.   Our son had many health problems, he cried a lot and so did we, but he also taught us how to accept things for what they are. Over the years, we have learned to be patient, accepting people. He has taught our whole family how to always find something positive in any situation. He has taught us that even though you may not be just like everyone else, everyone still has their own special qualities. You can do anything you put your mind to if you will only try. It might not be to the same capacity as the next person, but at least you have tried.   I now look at my other two children and wonder, how would their lives have been different if Brad was not born with all of his medical problems and other disabilities. I question whether they would have grown up to be such good people. Brad has been a learning experience for all of us. He is truly the most wonderful imperfection in our family.

      The author, Anna Mae Halgrim Seaver, is giving a detailed description of what her life is like in a nursing home in the essay, "My World Now. Throughout the essay, she describes how she has lost her privacy, independence and her freedom. She describes how one mundane day leads into another without any variation. Because one day is just like the next, it is difficult for her to know what day of the week it is. She talks about the residents with Alzheimer's who are not aware of where they are. I wonder if she insn't a little envious that they are not aware of their fate.  The author talks about the fact that even the employees don't stay long because it is not a desirable place to work.&nbsp;She states, "This is not the best job to have." They can move on to a better place of employment but she cannot.   My heart goes out to the author. Because people are living longer these days, they are often times unable to take care of themselves as they get older. Family structure is different today with both parents working and leading busy lives. The elderly can depend on their families to take care of them. They are forced to go to some kind of care facility to live out their days. They loose everything they have worked so hard for, even their privacy.&nbsp; They are so lonely. I don't know what the answer is, I only know that my heart breaks everytime I must go visit someone in the nursing home.

      After reading "I Want a Wife", written by Judy Brady, I got the distinct idea that the author was feeling taken advantage of by her husband. Throughout the essay, she gave many examples of all the things that she would like a wife to do if she could have one. I think that what she was really saying is that she wanted some recognition and appreciation for all the things she does for everyone else on a daily basis. She wanted someone to pamper her and make sure that everything was taken care of for her. I think the idea of this essay is to make us aware of all the things the "woman" or "wife" is expected to do for the family. Why is it the wife that always has to make the sacrifices? Why is it the wife that thinks of everyone else first? This essay is so typical of families today. There are certainly exceptions to this stereo-typical relashionship between husband and wife, but for the most part, I am sure that a lot of "wives" can relate to what the author is talking about. I liked the way the author ended the essay. I think what she was saying was, not only did her husband not appreciate her and all she does for him and the family, but he expects more. Somehow her husband puts no importance on his wives wants and desires. I never thought about it, but maybe I would like a wife also.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;&nbsp;

      After reading "Fighting Back", written by Stanton L. Wormley, JR., I wondered what I would have done if I had been in his position.&nbsp; I would have probably handled things the same way that the author did. The author was raised in a "upper-middle-class black family" which tells us that life was different for him than other black people from the start. The author did not hold the resentment, anger and frustration that many poor black people hold. He did not have to fight for everything he had. Because of his social class, the author was not angry at all white men. He did not feel the contempt for the white man that the other black soldiers did. He felt like he was an equal to the white man which is why he did not fight back when first attacked. I think the idea the author was trying to convey was that he almost felt ashamed for not fighting back in the first fight. He questioned his response to the fight wondering "Was I less of a man for not having beaten my attacker to a bloody pulp?" Self-defense and active and defiant fighting back were the two reasons the author felt&nbsp;that fighting back was justified. He felt that "fighting back" for the black man and other minority groups was a "statement of individual potency and self-determination." The author understood that by not fighting back, he had disgraced the entire black population. In the authors second fight he did choose to fight back. I think he fought back because of all the guilt he had harbored&nbsp;from disgracing his people years ago and also, he was probably more aware of the discrimination that his people and other minority groups experience after serving in the military. He had experienced life other than the upper-middle class life he was accustomed to. I found that I had great respect for the author admitting that after his second fight, he felt a "great sense of hollowness." Even though he was justified in retaliating and initially exhilarated by the fight, he did not like that he had become like the "others" and learned to fight back. What a good lesson that fighting never solves problems. No matter what.

      I find that I learn best from experience. Often times, as a child, if I was told not to do something, I had to do it just to see what would happen. I had to experience it for myself. Somehow just being told why I shouldn’t do something was not enough for me. I always had an unmanageable desire to stick my fingers in holes. Little holes, big holes, it didn’t matter. One day, all the neighborhood kids were playing tag in our yard. I was hiding on the side of the house behind some bushes and as I sat there waiting to be found, I saw a big pipe laying there. I couldn’t just leave it alone. I had to see if my finger would fit into the end of that pipe. Even though I had been told many times not to stick my fingers in holes, I stuck my finger in the pipe. When I tried to remove my finger from the pipe, it would not budge. I panicked, thinking, “Oh no, my mom is going to kill me for doing something like this again.” I had no choice but to come out from hiding and see if the neighborhood kids could help me out. We tried everything we could think of. From having a few kids grab on and pull, to trying to grease my finger up with cooking oil so that it would slip out of the pipe. Nothing worked. I knew I was going to have to call my mom at work and give her the bad news. I dragged the pipe up the stairs to our second floor apartment and made the dreaded phone call. Somehow, my mom was not surprised. She told me to fill the sink up with water and put a bunch of ice cubes in it so that I could soak my finger, hoping to reduce the swelling so the pipe would come off. I told her, “Mom, you don’t understand. The pipe is about 6 feet long.” She said she would be right there. Before I knew it, there was a police man at our door. Little did I know he was a friend of my mothers? I thought I was in bigger trouble than I had originally imagined.&nbsp;&nbsp; He explained that my mother had called and asked him to see what he could do for me. His only solution was to take a hack saw and cut the pipe shorter so it was more manageable. Still the pipe would not come off. After a trip to the fire department during which there were two fire calls and my finger left on hold in a vice to have the pipe cut off, I still had not learned my lesson.  If I had only been able to just learn about things because someone said so. Life would have been so much easier. I would never have gotten my finger stuck in my Grandfathers hospital bed, or the antique glass bottle that had been in our family for years. Once I was visiting my grandfather in the hospital. As I was standing by his bed, I noticed a little round hole on the corner of the footboard. I stood there playing with the cover that slid over it. The other family members in the room warned me not to stick my finger in that hole. I just had to do it. I just had to see if it would fit. Again, I was stuck. On the way home from visiting my grandfather in the hospital, we stopped at a restaurant to eat dinner. There was a long row of wooden posts that separated the dining area from the entrance of the restaurant. I casually stood by the posts with my family waiting for a table. I stood there and wondered, “I wonder if my head will fit between two of those posts?” I was warned by my mother not to even think about doing something so foolish because I was going to get stuck. I just had to do it. I just had to see if my head would fit between two of those posts. I couldn’t listen to someone who knew what they were talking about. I had to try it out for myself. There I was, in the middle of a busy restaurant, stuck between those two posts. I was left there, all alone, to figure out how I was going to get myself out of this one. My family looked on in amazement unable to understand how I could do something so dumb. Learning from others would certainly have been easier but life certainly wouldn’t have been as exciting. I would never have gotten my name in the paper explaining the whole pipe incident and at the end of the article they wrote, “And JoAnne was free!” &nbsp;If I could only have learned by example!  Looking back on my obsession with sticking my fingers in holes that they didn’t belong in, I realize that maybe I could have learned by example and experience. Maybe after getting my finger stuck in a hole once or twice, which is certainly learning by experience, I should have listened to the advice I got from others that told me, “Don’t do it again!” After years of experience, I have finally learned to suppress the urge not to stick my body parts into holes even though life isn’t nearly as exciting.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Dirty shoes and socks drive me crazy. I don’t know why, but they always have. I don’t remember it being a big deal when I was younger, but it seems that when I had children, dirty shoes and socks became important. My children hide their tennis shoes because they know that I will throw them in the washer if they are dirty. They tell me that dirty tennis shoes are the best, but I have a hard time dealing with them. Dirty flip flops, they don’t survive in our house. In the washer they go. When my children were little and they wore the little white baby Stride-Rite shoes, I would polish them every night before I went to bed. I found some kind of satisfaction in seeing those little white shoes all ready for the next day. Maybe my obsession came from the little white corrective shoes my son wore from the time he was about 3 months old. I had no choice of colors when he was first fitted for his size double zero shoes so white was what we had to take. His two little shoes were attached to a metal bar that the doctor would adjust when we would go for checkups. I remember that when Grandpa would hold our son, especially after working outside, the dirt from his clothing would rub off on his little white shoes. I never commented on it. I just knew that I would clean them up at the end of the day. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that when I was a little girl I had to wear braces and corrective shoes also. I was born with clubbed feet and my parents were told that I might never walk normally. I remember growing to despise those corrective shoes and braces. All the other girls my age had cute little dress up shoes and mine were just icky brown corrective shoes. I guess when I was a baby they were white but for some reason the only color available for my size was white or black. Every time I had to go for a brace fitting and new shoes, I would ask, “Is there any other color?” The answer was always the same. I used to be almost relieved when I was told that I had to have more surgery because it meant that I would get to wear cool white casts that could be painted and decorated instead of those icky brown corrective shoes.  &nbsp;  I remember when our son was born and we were told that he had clubbed feet; all I could think about was those icky brown shoes I wore when I was little. Fortunately, corrective shoes have improved since I was born and there is some variety to choose from.

      I enter the house thinking that a cup of coffee sure sounds good right now. While I am &nbsp;trying to keep busy doing all the things I am suppose to do before our company gets here, my wife is running around like a chicken with her head cut off. It can’t be that hard getting ready to have a little company. There can’t be that much to do. Terry, “Did you scrub the toilets?” “Kids, are your rooms cleaned up” I hear my name being called. What now? What ridiculous thing does she think needs to be done before our company arrives? Like our company is going to look under the beds or something. I hear her, here she comes, “Terry, did you clean up the garage?” Clean up the garage. Are we entertaining in the garage? Why on earth do I need to clean up the garage? I am sure there will be no one going into my garage. And besides, I think it looks pretty darn good. I cleaned it a month or so ago. Besides, how can a garage stay clean if you do any work in it?  &nbsp;  The company should be here soon. Do I dare ask if it’s okay for me to take a shower? I can’t shower too early because she will think I don’t have anything to do. I can’t shower too late because she will say I am just messing up the bathroom. Like our company is going to be in our bathroom. Here she comes again. Whew! There she goes!&nbsp; Oh Oh “Terry, would you make sure the kids cleaned up their rooms?” Cleaned up their rooms, they are just going to mess them up again why clean them up?  &nbsp;  I think it’s safe to head for the shower. I better not forget to wipe it down when I’m done. You never know, people may get the idea we actually use this bathroom.  &nbsp;  I wonder if I dare make some coffee. A good strong cup of coffee sounds good after all that work getting ready for our company. Hmmmm, where do I drink it? Is it to soon to sit down on the couch? There she goes again! She’s been getting ready all day. What could possibly be left to get done? The food must be done because I can smell it cooking. Looks like the table is set. I think it’s safe to sit down and relax a bit before the company arrives. “Terry, is that all you have to do is sit down and drink a cup of coffee? The company’s going to be here any minute.  &nbsp;  Ding Dong Ding Dong. Thank goodness they are here, maybe now I can finally have that cup of coffee.

      Dirt. What a confusing word. Dirt can be thought of as filth, garbage, something unwanted. We can't live without dirt. We live on it and a lot of the food we eat is grown in it.  &nbsp; There is no such thing as clean dirt. We don't like it when it blows around but we worry about it when it blows away. There is so much of it and yet we have to buy it.  &nbsp; What fun would children have without dirt. It seems like the dirtier they get, the more fun they are having. The bigger the dirt pile, the further their imaginations can go. It doesn't take anything special to play in dirt. A stick, an old container or just your hands and feet.  &nbsp; We can't live with it and we can't live without it.

      I just recently returned from college orientation with my youngest child. I anticipated this as such a sad time but, suprisingly it was not. I was full of many emotions from proud, amazed, anxious and wishful but not sad.  &nbsp;  I am so proud of my daughter and all of her accomplishments. From her athletic accomplishments to her academic accomplishments. She has experienced some difficult times along with the positive ones but she has learned to persevere. She has&nbsp;remained a very humble person even though she has so much to be proud of.  &nbsp;  Amazing is another word that comes to mind. All of my children have amazed me with their unique personalities and qualities but somehow she is different. She is so thoughtful and compassionate towards others and yet she is still able to meet her own&nbsp;personal needs emotionally. She knows when she needs time for herself but manages to balance those needs with the needs of others.  &nbsp;  I am anxious for my daughter because I worry sometimes that she&nbsp;is missing out on the "fun" things in life. She worries about things that most people her age don't think about. She worries about finances, family obligations, her siblings and her father and I.&nbsp;I remind her often that it is my job to worry about those things, not hers.  &nbsp;  I am wishful when I think of my daughter. She has the world by the tail and I wish that when I was her age, I could have been so sure of myself, so independent, so goal oriented. I wish that I had the passion she feels for life and everything in it at such a young age. I will miss her terribly&nbsp;when she is away at college, but she is ready to move on to bigger and better things and I can't wait to watch her fly.

      Tall magestic pine trees swaying in the wind. they tower over the forests above all other trees. They remain dark green and "solid" year round. They grow slowly but they remain strong. During the winter months, when everything else is dead and dormant, the pine tree remains green and healthy looking. They provide shelter for the forest creatures under their strong branches.&nbsp;Summer brings their time for growth and even though their needles are sharp to the touch, their new growth is so soft and smooth. Their new needles are a pale green and vulnerable at first, but soon they blend into the rest of the tree adding more strength and size.  &nbsp; Pine trees do not allow much growth underneath them. They don't need any other growth to sustain them. They stand strong and independently in the woods. Just like the pinecones they create. They remain strong and whole once they drop from the trees. &nbsp; The smell. I love the smell of pine trees. There is nothing better than the smell of fresh cut pine. It is a strong smell but a comforting smell.

      The best lesson my mother ever taught me was to not judge people. &nbsp; Throughout my childhood things were not easy. I was raised by a single Mom who wanted nothing but the best for me but at times, let her own needs and emotions overshadow being a parent.  &nbsp; As a child, I remember my mother always being either really "up" or really "down". It seemed like there was no inbetween. My mother worked two jobs to support us and "wanted" everything to be perfect for us. I think that was maybe part of the problem. Her idea of perfect and my idea of perfect were not the same. What things looked like on the "outside" was very important to my mother and still is.&nbsp;I was dressed well,&nbsp;I lived in a good home in a good neighborhood and&nbsp;I went to good schools. I know that there were times when my mother could not afford to dress me in the best clothes or send me to summer camps, but she managed to do it anyway. The sad part about it was that it meant she was working all that much more. She was not at home with&nbsp;me. In the evenings when I needed her for homework, she was working. When I needed her just to listen to what was on my mind, she was working. When I just needed a hug, she was working.  &nbsp; I know now that this was probably her way of showing her love for me and that she was probably avoiding feeling lonely, but it was not until I became an adult and had a family of my own that I realized&nbsp;it. I can remember getting so angry because I was tired of taking care of my brother and sister all the time. I would be in charge while my mom was away, which seemed like all the time, and then when&nbsp;she would get home, everything was turned upside down.&nbsp;I liked the house to be just so and my&nbsp;mom didn't care. I cooked meals at certain times and my mom would sometime forget about meals. &nbsp; Throughout those years, I continued to make mental notes as to what I would and wouldn't do as a parent. Of course,&nbsp;being a parent&nbsp;is not as easy as I thought it was when I was a child. I have been so fortunate. I was able to stay at home with my children&nbsp;when they were young. I have been able to be there for them in the evenings to&nbsp;help them with their homework and have supper cooked so that we can sit down as a family almost every evening. I have been able to be there when my kids needed hug or just someone to talk to but most of all, I&nbsp;have realized that I could not have done it without my husband of 25 years.&nbsp; &nbsp; I cannot imagine raising a family as a single parent. I now appreciate the sacrifices my mother made in order to provide us with what she thought we needed. Maybe she just couldn't be there emotionally for us then, but she did the best she could. I have since gotten over my resentment and anger for having to be the "mom" at home when I was young, but I realize now, that what my mom did was make me a better parent for my children. Thank you mom.

      Euthanasia  Euthanasia will be a world wide argument until there is no more disease, pain or suffering in the world. It will continue to be a very controversial subject. The question of Euthanasia is based on our value system. The way our values are arranged in individual personalities result in different beliefs and attitudes.   I personally think that one of the major contributors to the current problem with the moral issues of Euthanasia is due partly to the successes of medical science, not its failures. The increase in advanced medical technologies, especially life-sustaining ones, has brought the more recent focus on the various moral issues involved in euthanasia. When machines, tubes and computers take over, we sometimes loose sight of what is truly best for the patient and compassion along with common sense sometimes seem to suffer. Fortunately, there seems to be an increased awareness of the intrusiveness of modern technology. Is keeping someone alive always the right thing to do?  I have a 21 year old son with many health problems, some of them life threatening. I have seen the pain and the suffering that my son has experienced. I have felt the helplessness while sitting at his bedside unable to relieve his pain and suffering, wondering how much more can he take or can we take.   At age eight, our son and family were sent on a Make-A-Wish trip because he was not expected to live to be nine years old. We, as a family, deal with our son’s daily intravenous infusions lasting up to 11 hours, central line dressing changes, diabetes, blood transfusions, regular lab work, and constant trips to the doctor. Our son has undergone more than 30 operations, including one in which part of his stomach was removed. Along with numerous tumors being removed, he has also undergone a pancreas transplant. His transplant failed and he is presently on the waiting list, with high hopes that his next transplant will be a success. With the insurance company’s limit of only two transplants, if this next one fails, we as a family have to come up with the $200,000.00 needed to pay for another transplant in hopes of prolonging our son’s life.  He is also immune deficient meaning that he is always at risk of developing serious complications from only the simplest infections. Of course, we will do anything to keep our son with us, but we know that because of his complicated life threatening health problems, there may be a day when there is no more anyone can do.   I am ashamed to admit that there have been a few times, when we as a parents, have asked ourselves, how much more we should put our child through, but somehow, we have known to keep trying. I only hope that when, and if, the day comes, when there are no other healthcare choices, we have the option to make the decision that is best for our son and our family. I believe that we, along with our son, should have the right to choose whether he has suffered enough.   My own personal experiences influence my feelings about euthanasia and its morality.  I strongly believe that individuals should be allowed the right to choose how and when our lives should end in the case of terminal or incurable illness.

      I have always been envious of people who can put their feelings, thoughts or opinions on paper and actually have it make sense. To be able to make a point on paper and have others interpret your point as you want them to, must be very fulfilling.  What I have noticed as a result of reading the many different essays from “The Familiar Essay” textbook is that there is no right or wrong thing to say or write. It is how you say  and write it and when you say it. For example, writing from a child’s perspective is much more effective in the story “Coon Hunt” than it would have been had it been presented from an adults point of view. The short, direct sentences help us to understand the underlying message this author was trying to convey. I was fascinated by the subtleness the author used to present the abuse she was being subjected to by her father.   I have become much more aware of the underlying messages that a writer can weave into their stories. Often times this message can be missed if you are not actually looking for something. Reading a story more than once can give you a whole new perspective on what the author is writing about. I have found it very interesting when talking in class about stories that we have read, how one person can “read” a story so differently than another. When discussing the same story among class members, I love to hear all the different interpretations of the exact same story.

      The Big Fork River campground is a place that comes to mind. The huge pine trees, the ferocious river whooshing by. There is the wonderful sound of water that that I have always found to be so soothing and comforting. Every year we go camping to the Big Fork River campground. It’s a beautiful place just off the highway but you would never know it once you turn off the road and enter the campground. There are enormous rocks that line the river banks towering over the wild water that rushes by. There are campsites right on the river bank and I always hope that the one located on the “point” is available when we get there. You can not make reservations at this camp site so you never know what might be available. This spot is unbelievably beautiful. From the tall pine trees that stand in contrast to the bright blue sky, to the wild golden brown water that is constantly rushing by, it is all such a splendid site. Of course when we go there, we always know that Grandpa will be there guiding us as we park, as we unpack the campers, as we get everything organized.   He often times, would leave hours ahead of us, just so we could get the spot that we all loved so much. He would save it for us by parking there, knowing how much we loved it. It didn’t matter to Grandpa that he didn’t get the favorite spot. It was more important to him to save it for us. Once we got everything setup, and Grandpa was satisfied that everything was okay, we would go exploring. We would walk along the rocky banks of the river looking for any treasures that might have washed up. His main purpose for this walk was to find the best fishing hole so that we might have fish for supper. He knew we loved that too. Grandpa would make sure that he had the perfect marshmallow sticks cut for the after supper campfire that we all enjoyed so much. While we sat around the campfire, there was the whittling that needed to be done. The kids loved to try and guess just what Grandpa was going to create out of some little stick or log, and also, who would be the lucky recipient of the finished product. Somehow Grandpa always made sure that everyone had something he had whittled before the camping trip was over.   Morning was a time that could be a little frustrating with Grandpa. He would be up at the crack of dawn chopping wood to get the campfire going again. I would lay there and listen to him making sure that the fire was just right, and then we would hear the dreaded, bang, bang, bang on the camper door. “Time to get up, the day’s a wasting.” The kids would crawl out of their sleeping bags all sleepy eyed and head out the door to sit by the fire with Grandpa. He always made sure that there was a dry place to sit. They would talk about their plans for the day and of course pretend to criticize “Granny” and me for not hopping up right away to get breakfast going. Grandpa would say, “Time to get moving, the day is a wasting.” To Grandpa, camping on the Big Fork River was all about the adventures and the experiences he shared with all of us.  About a year and half ago, Grandpa passed away. We have not returned to the Big Fork River. Somehow it could never be the same without Grandpa there. We have talked as a family that we must return and carry on even though Grandpa is not there because, remember, “Time to get moving, the day is a wasting.”

      Have you ever really thought about how much time you spend worrying? I worry about my children, my husband, the house, and my work. I worry about school, my parents, my sister and her children. When I don't have some one to worry about, I seem to find some thing to worry about. Are the kids safe? Did my husband eat lunch? Did I remember to turn the iron off before I rushed out of the house? Did I remember to get all of my homework done? Is my sister doing okay after her husbands death? How are her children doing?  I rarely think about the time I spend worrying about all of these things, but every once in awhile I get a little selfish. I have to wonder, when is the last time I worried about me? I then realize that it has been a very long time since I have given much thought to myself. I used to enjoy reading, cross stitching, walking and even just sitting quietly all by myself every now and then. I can't remember the last time I have had the time to do any of those things. What would I do with time to myself and nothing to worry about?  If I could imagine a perfect afternoon all to myself it would have to be.... laying on our porch swing on a sunny afternoon. The birds are singing, the wind is blowing just enough to make the leaves rustle. The sun is shining on the back of the porch swing just enough to keep it comfortably warm. I am getting sleepy as the swing moves back and forth. I have been reading a wonderful book for too long and my eyes have grown tired. I close my eyes. As I lay there quietly taking in all of the sounds and smells of the beatuiful afternoon, I doze off. I sleep so soundly, not worrying about anything. No telephones ringing, no schedules to follow, no meals to be cooked and no laundry to be done. I sleep for hours. I don't dream. I am not worrying.   As I slowly awake, I realize that the warm sun has begun to disapear from the sky because the warmth on the back of the swing is no longer there. What a wonderful afternoon nap I have had. The birds are still singing and the leaves are still rustling and all of a sudden........ I here a screen door slam and then I here Mom, where are you? I'm home!

      Can I do it? Will I be able to keep up to it's demands? Will I be able to finish? Am I being selfish? These are the questions that I asked my self over and over and over again when I decided to go back to school. I would ride through the BSU campus looking at all the people walking from one class to another, wondering how many of them were my age or older. How were they doing it? Was it a possible task? Was I to old to be thinking about returning to school?  These are questions that still plague me from time to time but I have discovered, I can do it! It is possible! I am doing it! Somehow I am managing to go to school full time, take care of my family, work part time and still remain a sane human being. I will be the first to admit that I could not have done it without my family. They have been so supportive and encouraging. At times, when the load seemed to heavy, they would step up to the plate and do whatever needed to be done to make things easier for me. Granted, everyone is probably getting a little tired of Dad's "creative" cooking and his uncanny ability to get one red sock in with the white clothes every time he does laundry, but at least he tries.   I have a new appreciation for students, especially single parents that are trying to burn the candle at both ends. Give yourselves a huge pat on the back. You deserve it.

      Write about something people neglect without meaning to   From my experience of when I was married for ten years, I find the one thing that people neglect without meaning to is to give each other compliments. I feel that after being together for ten years we started to take each other for granted. Before the divorce, we tryed counseling and the one thing I found that was actually helping and working was writing down the positive things about each other and we continued doing this for five weeks and then that counselor moved to the cities and our marriage ended shortly after that.  We didn't continue to do what he had planned for us that what actually was working.  Taking each other for granted is very easy to do so I feel it's very worthwhile to put in the time and find out each others interests.  This is not the only thing that went wrong in my marriage.  My ex-husband was never one to communicate.  He was like living with a ghost.  Either that or I just talked too much for the both of us.  Sometimes I would tell him that.  But seriously, there are things I needed to compliment or thank him for and I didn't.  Such as, for example, changing the oil on my car so I wouldn't need to drive sixteen miles to town to have it done or taking the time off work to come to my job and change my flat tire.  I was wearing white jeans that day so I did very much appreciate it but being he was my husband at the time, I just figured this is what he's supposed to do so this is what I mean by taking someone for granted.  This was in our ninth year of marriage.  Of course, this works both ways.  We both worked at Marvin Windows in Warroad, Minnesota for the big window company.  I worked there for four years and to this day he is still there.  In the four years we worked there, I would pack out lunches and help get our two girls to daycare and for me, a thank you would have been nice just as it would have been for him.  I know I packed good lunches because one guy at his table would tell him he would want his lunch box instead of his own. So this is why I feel people take each other for granted and neglect each other without meaning to.  I also feel it has just been crazy with the hustle and bustle of life but what would it hurt to just take these few extra moments after work to talk and just say, "Hey, I really appreciate all you do for me. Thanks for sticking by my side."  One of the other things I noticed is that I would always make chocolate chip cookies and within a week they were gone.  (This part is making me hungry)  He would just ask if I made a new batch of chocolate chip cookies and I'd start in by making more and that one of the things of neglect. No comments on how good they were but where's more instead.  I feel I neglect listening to my daughter without meaning to.  She always catches me when I am busy with the dishes or doing laundry or getting after my three year old and I do try to explain when I tuck her in at night she can tell me then and I'll have her write it down what she wanted to talk about and then I think, Man, what would it hurt to leave the dishes soak and listen to what she has to tell me so sometimes I will do that but once I give her an inch she takes a mile.  She has been helping me so much with my three year old that I have thanked her time and time again and what an angel she has been and then she gets this big smile and just grins from ear to ear.  So one thing people neglect without meaning to is each other sometimes.  This is important to me because my two girls, Bridget and Brittany are my life and also my three year old son, Riley.  It is very hard being a single mom but in the end it is all worth it.

      I have five brothers and three sisters. We all have been in a car accident.  We also are hard workers and have tempers, every one of us.  Some of us control our temper and some of us do not.  We all agree about our one brother being dropped on his head or something because he is definitely the class clown and is loud and obnoxious.

      Today turned out to be a good day for me.&nbsp; I enjoyed getting something accomplished.&nbsp;   Yesterday started out with my son, Riley and his grandpa calling to see if we'd like to come over to pick peas from his garden.&nbsp; Brittany, my daughter, agreed to come with and help so on our way we went to Granpa Everetts' to pick peas.  Meanwhile, a van pulled up in the yard and this was Everett's son, Dale, and his three girls, Heidi, Holly and Ellie Mae.&nbsp; There Mom went to a reunion for the weekend.&nbsp; We enjoyed visiting and then Martha, the grandma, got off work and was home.&nbsp; Everett decided to take us all to Lengby, Minnesota for supper.&nbsp; They served walleye, chicken strips, and chicken drummies with a salad.&nbsp; The kids were pretty good and there was music.&nbsp; Ellie Mae started dancing.&nbsp; She is two years old and they're so cute at that age.  Shortly, after eating,&nbsp;we went to Everetts' where my daughter, Brittany wanted to spend the night.&nbsp; Riley and I went back to our house.  Today, we slept in some and took a bath and he couldn't wait to get back to grandpa's house to play with the girls.&nbsp; They live in Wahpeton so he doesn't get to see them often.&nbsp; Heidi is six years old and Holly is four years old.&nbsp; Ellie Mae, as I mentioned earlier, turned two years old in May.&nbsp;&nbsp;Riley also turned three years old in May and my daughter, Brittany is eleven years old.  While we were out there, I worked on essays I had for class to finish up.&nbsp; Grandpa made Brats on the grill and they were really good.&nbsp; He and Martha went to visit friends who were up here from texas so we decided to go fishing out on the pontoon at pine lake.&nbsp; The kids were all excited.&nbsp; Earlier, they were playing with kittens out on the farm and forgot all about them when pine lake and fishing were mentioned.  Dean and Dale went to get gas for the pontoon.&nbsp; I applied sunscreen to all the kids while waiting for them to return.&nbsp; They bought drinks for the kids and us also.&nbsp; We had three fishing lines going and Heidi caught a sixteen inch walleye that weighed a little over two pounds.&nbsp; We had lots of fun.&nbsp; My daughter enjoyed herself and even got the chance to drive the boat.&nbsp; So did one of Dale's girls, Holly, the four year old.  It turned out to be a beautiful day out on the lake with a fresh breeze just enough blow to hit for the cooling one needed from the sun beating down on us.&nbsp; It felt good.&nbsp; It was nice and relaxing.&nbsp; The kids behaved well for five of them on the pontoon.&nbsp; Roger owned the pontoon and helped get minnows on the hooks for the kids.&nbsp;&nbsp; There also was another couple along and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Riley caught a fish that got away before we got it in the pontoon.&nbsp; Heidi, the six year old, caught a northern that got away also.&nbsp; Scott, another guy, caught a fish that he threw back because he didn't feel like cleaning fish.&nbsp; Dale caught a ting northern, just a baby one that he threw back so the only one who caught something to keep was Heidi.&nbsp; She was very proud but unhappy when roger filleted her fish because she wanted her mom to see it.&nbsp; Good thing I had a camera in my purse since this is the first fish she has caught and has proof to show her fish to her mother.  We went to the lodge to see if grandpa and grandma were there and they were.&nbsp; Riley was getting tired and spilled M&M's on the floor so I decided to go home with him.&nbsp; He fell asleep about eight thirty.&nbsp; He looked pretty tired.  I decided to get my ceiling in the livingroom painted.&nbsp; I just had white ceiling paint.&nbsp; It still looks like it will need another coat.&nbsp; Since I was painting,&nbsp;I decided to do the walls in Dover White.&nbsp; They also need another coat of paint but at least now the walls are all the same color.&nbsp; What a job it can be.&nbsp; I'm not one for painting so I'll be glad when it is done.&nbsp; I feel there is a lot I accomplished today.&nbsp;   It is now after midnight and I hope to get a good nights' sleep in.&nbsp; I did relax with pop and popcorn for a few minutes when I wrapped up the painting stuff like the brushes and putting the lids back on the paint so I can start again tomorrow.  Brittany stayed the night again at Everetts' with the girls so when I get up, I'll go pick her up or call and see what time Dale is going back to Wahpeton.&nbsp; I just love good days like this with a memory created for the girls in the fun they had and my son, Riley.&nbsp; He was plumb, tuckered out from a fun-filled day.&nbsp; I hope there's more to come of days like this.&nbsp; The perfect day is what I'd call it.

      My dad now eighty three years old talks of the price of gasoline and how dramatically things have changed from his time.&nbsp; How different in the world today now.&nbsp; It's gone up again!&nbsp; It is on average at one dollar and eighty-eight cents.&nbsp; This is just ridiculous when the price of gasoline went up to over two dollars a gallon.&nbsp; How outrageous is that?&nbsp; I remember driving by wal-mart and telling my oldest daughter, "At these prices, Mom is going to have to quit school!"&nbsp; It was just getting to be too high of a price.&nbsp; I live forty-five miles away and round trip it takes a lot of gas, not to mention the wear of the tires. My three year old was on the riding lawnmower with me last week and I ran out of gas.&nbsp; We went to fill the gas can so I decided to fill my car too.&nbsp; It was over thirty dollars.&nbsp; I couldn't believe it.&nbsp; When I got home, I told him to play on his swingset in the playpen until I get the grass mowed around the trees.&nbsp; He is three years old and mischievious.&nbsp; I filled the pushmower up with gas and left the gas can sitting within his reach.&nbsp; I had the inside of the fence to mow and he spotted this bright red can and starting dumping the gasoline on the ground.&nbsp; He's lucky I didn't tan his behind.&nbsp; I stripped his clothes, washed them two times in the washer and gave him a bath.&nbsp; He had gotten gasoline all over his pants.&nbsp; He had spiderman pajamas on that he refused to take off and wanted to wear them for the day.&nbsp; After getting gasoline all over and on the ground he had no choice but to go in the tub and get different clothes to wear.

      The crack in my windshield bothers me because I don't know how it happened.&nbsp; Isn't that glass to be made strong enough?&nbsp; Sometimes a rock chip when meeting a car or behind a truck flying at the window leaves an impression.&nbsp; I wonder what glass in made out of?&nbsp; I would think they would make a windshield strong enough to withhold a rock chipping the window but I suppose going down the road and this rock is flying up at sixty miles an hour, it's just lucky the whole window didn't shatter.&nbsp; I still can't figure out this one break in my window.&nbsp; It is on the passenger side and is spreading out like a spider.&nbsp; The only thing I can think of is a baseball hitting it.&nbsp; There was an auction and I noticed it after the sale.&nbsp; Now the one crack in the windshield is cutting across getting close to the driver side.&nbsp; I have had people tell me that it looks like a break from the inside or the sun can do that to a window.&nbsp; I had to laugh.&nbsp; How cn the sun have done it when I had my car parked in the shade?&nbsp; The day was very hot.&nbsp; I guess to find out, I will never really know what happened, just that I need to get it fixed.&nbsp; It is still on the passenger side slowing innching its way to the driver side right where it is eyesight level.&nbsp; The crack coming across is by the mirror now and I'm hoping it will bend downward instead of hit at eye level.&nbsp; I don't want to get stopped for this cracked window.&nbsp; Someone told me once that the state trooper will do that.&nbsp; I would think it would need to be pretty bad for that to happen and with most of this in the upper right hand corner of the passenger side, I would think this isn't as serious as other car windows that I have witnessed in parking lots or the grocery story lot.&nbsp; Some cars don't even have a window.&nbsp; Other cars put up cardboard.&nbsp; Some cars use cheap plastic and some cars don't cover the window at all.&nbsp; I'm happy with the car I have now.&nbsp; I find myself grateful for the one I have when I see others driving cars worse than my own.

      Volleyball is a sport that I loved to play in high school.&nbsp; I wasn't the best player or the worse.&nbsp; I enjoyed every year that I played.&nbsp; I joined seventh through twelvth grade.&nbsp; I tryed other sports but this was my favorite and the one I enjoyed.&nbsp; One time I remember being the only one with a perfect serving record.&nbsp; My couch showed me the stats when were playing Adults against the eighth grade team.&nbsp; This sport is to be taken seriously with a couch or another way to see it is just to have fun out on the beach with friends in the warm sun.&nbsp; So this sport is an either/or situation.&nbsp; To have fun with it or to take it seriously.&nbsp; Whichever one to pick or choose, it is always a fun sport to me.

      It's christmas and i'm excited today because mom, dad and my sister are going to get the christmas tree today.&nbsp;&nbsp; I get to ride in the sled hooked to the snowmobile.&nbsp; There is a saw and I get to help cut down our christmas tree.&nbsp; We drive around and mom and i are in back.&nbsp; Dad dumps us out in the snow.&nbsp; We are laughing and having fun.&nbsp; My sister is helping my dad drive.&nbsp; We spot the tree we want for&nbsp;christmas.&nbsp; My dad starts to cut it down.&nbsp; This is at the ESPE Tree Farm in Wannaska.&nbsp; We live twelve miles from there.&nbsp; We now head back to the cabin to pay for our tree.&nbsp; Mrs. Espe invites us in for her hot chocolate and homemade cookies.&nbsp; We enjoy them and I ask to take some cookies home.&nbsp; There are other people to visit with.&nbsp; We load our tree and head home.&nbsp; Dad finishes trimming the tree while mom finds the stand for the tree.&nbsp; My sister and I help mom find the decorations.&nbsp; We are all tired but too excited so dad brings in the tree and we string the lights on first.&nbsp; We continue to decorate and I want to string popcorn.&nbsp; I don't finish stringing the popcorn that night.&nbsp; Mom is helping me.&nbsp; Even though we finish with the decorations being put on the tree,&nbsp; my mom helps me the next day to get the popcorn string done and we somehow manage to make it look nice and add it to our.&nbsp; We went to my Sunday School program and when we got home we took turns taking pictures in front of the tree.&nbsp; I wonder which presents are mine?&nbsp; Every year we take turns putting the angel on top of the tree.&nbsp; My mom told me once she watches over us while we sleep.&nbsp; We have our own special day for opening presents before we go to granpa and grandma's house.&nbsp; One year I asked santa for a furby but I didn't get one.&nbsp; I was disappointed but mom said that santa had too many kids asking for the same thing and his elves couldn't keep up.&nbsp; Later, in april for my birthday I got my furby.&nbsp; I had lots of fun and then I ended up with another one from a friend who had given one to me.&nbsp; It was fun to teach them how to talk.&nbsp; One was the color blue and the other was light blue.&nbsp; Now I've outgrown them and gave them to my sister.

      Ever since I was three years old, I remember complaining of the back of my knees always hurting.&nbsp; My mom&nbsp;told me I'd run too much so I was to take it easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;She would rub the back of my&nbsp;knees until I would fall asleep and&nbsp;the minute she would quit rubbing I would wake up immediately. Later on, during my teenage years, I ended up in the hospital with pnemonia for a week and lost forty pounds.&nbsp;  After that I kept having health problems.&nbsp; I ended up in the hospital&nbsp;again for a&nbsp;blood transfusion.&nbsp; I had to have three pints of blood&nbsp;that my brothers had to donate back because my mom and dad were too poor to pay for the bill. I ended up in the emergency many times for sprained ankles and wrists.&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctors never could figure it out until 1986 when&nbsp;I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritus.&nbsp; That&nbsp;was in fosston, minnesota.&nbsp;Dr. Havens was the doctor at that time. He sent me to Dr. Lessard, a rheaumatologist,&nbsp;in Grand Forks, N.D.&nbsp; He&nbsp;had a bad bedside manner.&nbsp; I went to him for five years.&nbsp; One time he told me to&nbsp;drink a beer at night to loosen up.&nbsp; I was upset because my health was going to hell in a handbasket.&nbsp;  I took my health for granted, started to feel sorry for myself, and getting depressed on top of it. When I married, I had a little girl and I was&nbsp;overwhelmed with being a new mom.&nbsp; I had postpartum depression that&nbsp;I was not diagnosed for but I would cry over&nbsp;little things.&nbsp; The way she smiled, the way she cryed, etc... When in Warroad, I worked at Marvin Windows and&nbsp;was pregnant with my second child.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth month, I was sick from here on out with the&nbsp;pregnancy.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was born five weeks early and in the NICU in Grand Forks hospital for&nbsp;thirteen days.&nbsp; She was five pounds, seven and a quarter ounces.&nbsp; The doctors were&nbsp;stumped of her&nbsp;early delivery and I was scared myself.&nbsp; I started to have blackouts and had trouble walking.&nbsp; I&nbsp;stayed home four months and then returned to work.&nbsp; I brought in an American with Disibilities handbook and within&nbsp;minutes I had a sitdown job.&nbsp;I put up with a lot of sny remarks.&nbsp; It was aweful. I tryed other jobs and still was sick.&nbsp; I kept getting sick and slipping deeper and deeper into depression. Finally, to the doctor again.&nbsp; This was in warroad, mn&nbsp;and was diagnosed with Lupus.&nbsp; I was sent to the Mayo Clinc and there were various tests where I was diagnosed with a blood clotting disease, a thyroid problem, and lupus. I was put on medication and feeling much better.&nbsp; Then the depression hit me hard.&nbsp; I had a terrible job, my marriage was terrible and I ended up in the hospital for medication that worked against me. I became suicidal and was taken off of the drug.&nbsp; I got better eventually.&nbsp; I have been stressed and burdened with health problems tremendously.&nbsp; And now, I still have problems but do the best I can to cope with what is a lifelong experience that won't go away.

      I would love to fix my house but have little money to do this on.&nbsp; The basement is one thing I really would like to get done but I don't see that happenind for a while.&nbsp; I decided to concentrate on my living room so thursday I went to Menards in Grand Forks to price out everything I need.&nbsp; I was having fun.&nbsp; It's going to cost me about two hundred dollars to get my living room done.&nbsp; The walls I am going to do in dover white.&nbsp; I'm going to get blinds that are an ivory color and these neat looking rods to have a tan sway above the blinds.&nbsp; I'm going with a shade darker for the trim and when I finish this class this is what I hope to work on during my two weeks off before school starts up again.&nbsp; I'm excited because my walls are blue and one is brown.&nbsp; I was experimenting.&nbsp; I can't wait to see the change. I have a light green on my trim and this is a hideous combination.&nbsp; I am going to take before and after pictures and I can't wait. I also need to get the ceiling painted.&nbsp; When I was at school, the girls busted the blind on the one window by playing ball in the house.&nbsp;  Anyway, I can't wait until I get it done.

      I dated my high school sweetheart and we were married ten years.&nbsp; We divorced in 1999.&nbsp; He is now remarried and I remain single.&nbsp; I became depressed and isolated myself from everyone.&nbsp; I stayed home.&nbsp; In January this year, I somehow got started in school and my self esteem has increased.&nbsp; It's been hard because I am a single mom and tire easily because I also have Lupus, an immune disease.&nbsp; At present, this is in remission. I only planned on school and taking care of my kids.&nbsp; I had no interest in finding someone in my life.&nbsp; This didn't happen.&nbsp; I was helping my friend get ready for an aution sale and she had company stop in.&nbsp; He wanted me to meet this guy.&nbsp; I wouldn't agree to the blind date deal but I would meet him if he were to come with.&nbsp; I had a bad experience on a blind date and this turned me from ever going on another one. This guy seems really nice but is not divorced.&nbsp; He had been separated nine months and I think today is actually when the divorce is final.&nbsp; I've been seeing him for about a month now.&nbsp; For the first week he called me everyday and was also over everyday.&nbsp; I found it hard to get my school work done because he would stay until 11:00 p.m. or later and then go home. One time he called and asked about us and I told him the truth.&nbsp; I really have been getting mixed messages and don't have time for anyone in my life right now.&nbsp; I got a bad feeling and within minutes he was over.&nbsp; Thank goodness I was at my friends.&nbsp; He stayed for three and a half hours.&nbsp; He did take the kids to the park but my friend told me not to leave so I didn't. I thought it was over.&nbsp; He called leaving a message to call him back.&nbsp; I didn't.&nbsp; Friday, the last day of speech, my friend rode back to clearbrook with me.&nbsp; She lives in Bemidji but her parents live in clearbrook.&nbsp; She is one who&nbsp;smokes and it was late.&nbsp; There was no place to stop but the Leonard bar and this guy was waiting for me.&nbsp; Before she got out of the car he came out and gave me the dirtiest look.&nbsp; She went in for her&nbsp;cigarettes and he came over.&nbsp; He told me&nbsp;how rude&nbsp;I&nbsp;was on Wednesday.&nbsp; I thought it was rude of him to come over and I let him know it.&nbsp; He told me it would work and of course talked me into going to&nbsp;the Besida Bar and Grill for supper and talk things over.&nbsp; We never did talk much but had prime rib which was delicious. We went to&nbsp;Sportsmans Lodge after&nbsp;and danced.&nbsp; On the way there,&nbsp;he talked of his drunken, soon to be ex-wife.&nbsp; I hear of her everyday and finally told him if I got to listen to one more word i'm going to get mad.&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; I let him have it and told him of my divorce. He said,  "See, you do the same thing."&nbsp; Oh, if nothing made me more mad that did and to top it off&nbsp;he told me to get over it.&nbsp; This really pissed me off because I have been divorced five years, joined a support&nbsp;group for divorced, widowed, and separated and felt much better and I am glad to be over mine. There was another incident soon after that&nbsp;I would say was about a week ago.&nbsp; He told me I&nbsp;had problems and worded it just&nbsp;right to piss me off again.&nbsp; I told him to stay out of my life and I didn't need this.&nbsp; Just stay away from me and leave me alone.&nbsp; It didn't work. The waterpump went out on his pick-up and today I am going to try work up my nerve to end it again.&nbsp; I went out saturday night.&nbsp; I am not a drinker but I'm glad I was drinking and by myself that night.&nbsp; I had a lot of fun and stayed at a cabin so I didn't drink and drive.&nbsp; I&nbsp;think I was drinking just to get all the worries off my mind and this doesn't make me proud to drink.&nbsp; I just don't like it but that night something got into me and I drand windsor cokes.&nbsp; I had four.&nbsp; More than enough for me because&nbsp;I am a non-drinker.&nbsp; It hit&nbsp;me hard. This guy just wants to&nbsp;be friends but gives me mixed signals and turns this around on me saying I am doing this to him.&nbsp; I see his good points in how he is a good worker, keeps his house clean and takes care of his kids.&nbsp; His bad point is he wants to see me all the time.&nbsp; Last time, he said I should just put school off.&nbsp;&nbsp;I told him&nbsp;not a&nbsp;chance. Anyway, I how I get this worked out soon before I get sick and my Lupus flares up.&nbsp;

      I chose this topic because I have a sister who is in deep trouble because of meth.&nbsp; This started a while ago when she met this guy selling and dealing meth.&nbsp; This is what got her started. She dated him for two&nbsp;to three years.&nbsp; It seemed longer to me because personally I didn't like him from the start.&nbsp; He started keeping and turning her against family like we were the ones who weren't helping her.&nbsp; He tell her we were no good and she should stay away from us which she did.&nbsp; She paid $8000.00 dollars for a trailer house and within a six month frame period she had borrowed money from the bank and had nothing left to show for herself. She got away from him by moving to Grand Forks and met another guy not much better than the first.&nbsp; How can she keep meeting this men who are no good for her?&nbsp; He smoked marijuana and has been in jail and on probation numerous times.&nbsp; She has an eleven year old daughter from her first and only marriage.&nbsp; With the guy in grand forks she has a daughter and son which are a year apart in age.&nbsp; My niece will be two years old in septemper and my nephew will be one year in september.&nbsp; One was born the 22nd of sept. and the other, the 16th. There has been so much confusion and sadness.&nbsp; I don't know myself how to deal with it all because there is nothing I can do. Last year when my nephew was born, he tested positive for having meth in his system.&nbsp; My sister called me frightened and scared.&nbsp; I went down to Grand Forks where he was in the NICU.&nbsp; There wasn't much I could do.&nbsp; Social Services placed him in Foster Care.&nbsp; That is how it works when they are born in the hospital and family has no say.&nbsp; We did about my niece.&nbsp; My sister in the cities had come up to take her to her home for a while and then my brother had her for a while.&nbsp; My&nbsp;sister went to treatment last year and in December she came to my house.&nbsp; She looked better and felt better than she had in a long time.&nbsp; I have a lot of ambivalance toward my sister and I did try to help.&nbsp;  It took a while but when I started school she had gotten back her kids and stayed with me in January, 2004 for a month.&nbsp; My mom lived four miles from me so I told her with my going to school it was too hard for me.&nbsp; I have a small house and my mom has an extra room so I asked her to go there.&nbsp; She threw a fit and told me I was throwing her to the curb when she needed me most.&nbsp; I know I didn't because she had my mom's place to stay. As I'm writing this, I found out yesterday that she had a bad U.A.&nbsp; I was shocked because she had been doing so well.&nbsp; My other sister who is thirteen months older than I visited her regularly.&nbsp; She had been on house arrest for three months and would of had it taken off yesterday.&nbsp; My brother and Mom went to get my niece because he is taking her so social services doesn't place her in fostercare.&nbsp; My nephew is going to foster care to the same people who had him before.&nbsp; They are the most wonderful people and have been there trying to help my sister and her kids.&nbsp; My niece, who is eleven years old is staying with her aunt because her dad is working construction in the cities.&nbsp; He comes home every week-end to see her.&nbsp; This is the same arrangement that was set up before. When she got into trouble before it was in the paper and of course people talk.&nbsp; My sister puts the blame on me for everyone finding out and this time I don't care.&nbsp; I'm so mad that I want to slap her and hug her at the same time. I feel torn.&nbsp; I feel hurt.&nbsp; I hated that I had to tell my two daughters about this.&nbsp; They both love their aunt dearly and I just don't know what to do anymore.&nbsp; I let my oldest daughter, who is fourteen years old stay there for one week to help out with the kids not realizing the dangerous environment I had placed her in.&nbsp; I wasn't thinking of that.&nbsp; I thought to help keep my sister off of drugs, known as crank, it would help to have her babysit the kids.&nbsp; Now I will not allow her to go there.&nbsp; Only if we visit and then leave.&nbsp; My sister isn't willing to give up on the guy she is with who is still in jail but will be getting out on probation shortly.&nbsp; What a messed up life for her. What I want to do is try to forget about all this and concentrate on my going to school and taking care of my own kids.&nbsp; This is difficult to do because in order to work out problems such as this one, I go to a counselor myself.&nbsp; There is no way I can deal with this on my own.&nbsp; My family gets mad at me because they don't want anyone to know.&nbsp; They are in denial and with it being in the newspaper,&nbsp; I don't know how they figure this isn't going to get out.&nbsp;  I cryed when I heard of this happening all over again.&nbsp; I hear people say that meth is the worse addictive behavior to have and it is hard to get off of and stay away from it.&nbsp; I guess she thinks more of her addiction than she does the life of her own kids.&nbsp;  I don't know what is going to happen but this time I would think she gets jailtime.&nbsp; I don't even want to have anything to do with her anymore.&nbsp; I love and hate her at the same time but she was given a chance and I can't see how she could be so dumb to screw it up again.&nbsp; You'd think she'd of learned from the first time of losing her kids.&nbsp; This time may be permanent placement and to tell you the truth it&nbsp;would be for the best.

      There isn't a whole lot that I know of about tomatoes but I sure do like the cherry tomatoes. My dad starts planting tomatoes indoors in the back bedroom. He keeps it cool with the door shut and checks and waters them daily. He keeps them by the window with the shade drawn at night and in the morning, when the sun is shining, he draws the blind up so the tomatoes can get some sunlight. He is the biggest fanatic when it comes to his tomatoe plants. My dad last year had a tomato plant and I asked him what kind of plant that was. I thought it to be quite ugly myself. And that was the name of it. The Ugly Tomato. He has even had some yellow tomatoes and I have no idea what they are but they don't taste much different. He plants way too many tomato plants. He had people from all over town in gonvick, minnesota coming over for tomatoes and he has plenty. Gonvick is a small town. The population is around three-hundred. My mom does a lot of canning with tomatoes and uses them mostly when making chili. They sure are much better than store bought tomatoes. Sometimes when I stop over there will be tomatoes sliced on a plate on the table and I will eat some of them with a sprinkle of sugar on them. My dad will put salt and pepper on his and my three year old son will just take and eat them plain. My daughter, Brittany doesn't care for tomatoes much. Bridget, my oldest daughter does though. She will ask grandpa everytime we are there if she can have some tomatoes to take home and everytime he helps her to pick the best ones she can find. She also loves the cherry tomatoes. I'm not as big of a tomatoe fan but I do like them fresh from the garden for a B.L.T.

      Someday, I hope to have a house bigger than what i am living in now and have enough money to do what i want instead of just live paycheck to paycheck.  It gets old.  In this neck of the woods, I wonder how many of us there are.  I think there are only a few people with money in this area and I wish I were one of them.   Someday, I hope to take a trip myself. This won't happen for a while because my youngest is three years old and i want to enjoy myself with hopefully someone special in my life by that time. Someday I hope to go to Hawaii. Someday could go on forever but I hope someday I will also win the lottery or go to the black hills.  That may be a goal i could start now. Someday, I would like to go on an airplane or the amtrak to montana where my niece lives. Someday, I hope they find a cure for cancer and other illnesses.  Sooner than later. Someday.

      I still see myself jumping around a bit but i find myself putting more thought into what i am writing about and i see it improving a little bit at a time.  I may not write the best but i do the best i can.  I enjoy reading the storys' and trying to write on the subject afterwards.  It's fun to see what i come up with and i think by the end of class i will be doing a lot better.  I am having fun and i do think it also is helping improve my own self-esteem.  I feel more confident than i did in the beginning.

           I found this a tough subject.  To find something meaningless.  When mentioning the paper clip in class i thought that it helps hold papers together so that isn't meaningless to me.  Then I thought of tape but realized that helps with wrapping presents so the thing i find meaningless is butter or margarine.  I just don't see the difference.  I can take it or leave.  All i ever had was margarine and I was fine with that.  My sister-in-law grew up on butter but my brother says the same thing i do.  Margarine is cheaper and to my brother and i, there really isn't much difference to us.  Reminds me of when i make chocolate chip cookies.  I use two sticks of margarine and the thought never occurred to me to use butter.  When i make chocolate chips bars, i use margarine.  In fact, i only buy butter when it is cheap enough.  It has to be on sale for me.  I don't know what the point of this meaningless subject is and i can't find an end.  The only time I have used butter is if i have bought it on sale and use when i make mashed potatoes but it makes no difference to me because it tastes the same to me even if i use margarine and i don't even think my sister-in-law can tell the difference then.  Especially, if gravy is poured over the top of the mashed potatoes when eating them.  How would anyone know which one i used, butter or margarine.  I guess the point I see myself coming to is "Buy margarine! It's Cheaper!

           I think we have all improved in this class with our writing.  At first, I think it was hard for all of us and this class, to me, requires more of a thinking process so I have seen all of us improve on that.      I like that we share our opinions because  it is amazing to me of how we can read the same essay and still see things different.  I find the sharing helps me to see another angle or focus that i hadn't before.      I like this class but i feel pressed for time.  I'm glad I have only this one left for the summer.

           I enjoyed going to the park a lot.  It was my place of escape for some peace and quiet and I enjoyed the culvert and the river.  I remember there was a tree that had fallen across that river and I would walk and sit there for a long time.  I feel like there was a spot just for me because on that tree that fell across that river, it had another part of a tree branching upward.  This is what I considered to be my private spot and this tree had a built in chair for me, so it seemed.  That is how I pictured it.  I went there everyday during the summer.  The grass was so green.  There were also outhouses so I wouldn't need to go home to use the bathroom.  There were trees with names carved into them.  One had the shape of a heart with someones initials abbreviated inside that heart.  There were picnic tables.  Those also had abbreviations or initials in them as well.  We would have our last day of Sunday School at this park in Gonvick, Minnesota.  We would have teachers bring bars or we would pack a lunch, if we liked.  We played games and I remember someone falling into the river.  I don't remember exactly who it was but he/she was completely drenched from his head to his/her toes.        I went there to the park for Sunday School and Vacation Bible School Settings.  Sometimes as the child and sometimes as the Teacher.  I think I taught Sunday School for three years and I also helped with Vacation Bible School for two years.  We played games and ate lots of food.     I think this place I found to be safe for me in my life and I also have a lot of enjoyable memories.  I remember going there also with my brother and sister.  We would be running through the culvert because, at times, there wasn't much water so we would start running and swaying and moving from side to side so we wouldn't get wet by the water.  We would just keep having fun going back and forth from one end of the culvert to the other.  We weren't the only ones who did this because I remember the graffiti inside that culvert.       My brother, Dennis, would go fishing there during the summer and we'd tag along, my sister, Jane and I.  I spent a great deal of summer with a friend.  Her name was Sherry. We would also go there a lot and sometimes we would fall in.  I remember one time the water was going pretty rapidly and I didn't think nothing of it at the time but we could have drowned.  Boy, I don't know if my Mom knows about that to this day.      I think the existance for this essay is that I found this place comfortable and convenient for me.  I would go down there and sometimes walk along the river to see where it led to.  I was gone for a long time.  It took me about two hours just to walk the one way of the river because I would find or spot some interesting things.  I thought of having a place where I would build a fort but that never happened.  I only imagined it.      It's sad to say, but I think this was a hiding spot for me, away from my dad when he was drinking.  I'd get tired of the arguing and fighting so this is where I would always go for hours.  I also believe Sunday School is another Safe Haven place I found to be and I enjoyed the songs.  Sometimes, I would sit on that tree and remember a song from church and sing.  One of those songs, that I remember, is: "What a Friend we Have in Jesus."  I also feel this was something I'd like to say was my thinking grounds.  I found peace and serenity in these surroundings.

      I think I have more than one imperfection in my family but one thing while growing up is I remember my Dad being gone a lot and found out that he is an Alcoholic.  I grew up with five brothers and three sisters and some are alcoholics and some are not.  I may not have turned into an alcoholic but I do remember how tough it was for all of us.  There were a lot of sleepless nights and I remember being very tired for school some days because my dad would come home drunk and wake us all up and finally he'd either pass out or start eating something and then go to bed.  I had a hard time accepting and not understanding much about alcoholism until I went too some Al-Anon meetings and it made me understand to detach from the alcohol, and not the alcoholic.  Words just can't describe how many bottles of whiskey I dumped down the drain and my brothers and sisters did the same thing.  That wasn't the end of it though.  Something worse had to happen before my dad went to seek treatment and that was the part of molesting my niece.  This I have only been able to comprehend in the last couple years because I was a Senior when this happened.  When you think things can't get any worse than the drinking, it can.  Thank goodness it was fondling and no intercourse.  That sounds bad but I'm thankful for that part of it not getting any further than it already had.  My Dad is now a recovering alcoholic but still I find it hard to me to this day to see him and not picture what has been done.  I know it wasn't me and nothing did happen to me.  As for the rest of my family members, I can not say for sure.  It is another sick disease.  My dad is now eighty-three years old and I'm not sure why I am writing of this now but I still love my Dad and Mom even though what has happened is wrong.  I remember my niece saying at the time that she didn't want to get grandpa in any trouble but I guess this is what it took for the drinking to stop.  He had a hard time because he was away in treatment for three and a half years and I wrote him back a letter when I received one from him.  It still really hurts when something like this happens and I think I speak for my dad, my family and myself when I say we still always will suffer great emotional pain from this.  I feel this imperfection helped my dad to seek the help he needed.  The one thing I hate about all of this is why didn't he get help before it had come to that?  I guess I'll never know.  This was very hard for me to write about because in some ways I feel ashamed to be a part in this as family.  All I know is, I never left my girls alone with my Dad even though I love him.  He may have this imperfection and his faults but he has taught me a lot also and in the last couple years, I've actually been able to talk and enjoy being around my dad where as before I would feel somewhat uncomfortable but not anymore.

      Bonnie Erlandson  College Writing I  July 3, 2004  In the story, ONE HOUR, the author catches my attention by starting out the day being so beautiful and then as I read further on I see it changing into something else.  That they are on their way to the hospital to pay their last respects to their wonderful father and grandfather.  This catches me off guard for a moment until I continue to read further on.  I think it's because of the way it just starts out being the nice day and I find it hard to believe when someone you know is sick but with his suffering the peace finally comes to an end for his family and himself when he passes away, knowing his loved ones were there, by his side, to comfort him.  I think the author, while talking about his grandfather and what I also see, is the sense of humor being used, the way is grandfather always smiled and never letting his family know his pain, the talking of childhood memories brings me back to the little time I spent with my grandfather because he passed away when I was young. His birthday was March 10th and what a coincidence, so is mine.  I remember both my grandma and grandpa often, especially while reading this story, ONE HOUR.  This story takes me back to the day my Grandpa passed away and my dad wouldn't let me go to the funeral.  I remember him chewing snooze and spitting it into a folgers coffee can, holding me on his lap and the lump he had on the one side of his face by his chin because it was obvious for anyone to see.  I also remember my grandmother being put in the home shortly after my grandpa died.  It wasn't long before she passed away and I remember getting to go to her funeral and I'll never forget how beautiful she looked.  I can still picture her to this day and she looked like an angel and that is exactly how I remember her.  She was a very caring person.  This is the grandparents on my dad's side and I wasn't born yet when my mom's parents passed away so I only go by storys that I hear from my mom or her sister or brother.  Mostly, I just remember my Dad's parents though.  It doesn't seem like the memories ever fade.  Only that the time gets longer that they've been gone.  I loved them both very much.

      I make great homemade apple pies. This is what I am told by my family anyway and it does feel really good to do something I enjoy and this makes me feel wonderful and helps me forget all my worries because I get into making my own homemade crust and peeling the applies and making a little apple out of the crust to put on top when I'm ready to pop them in the oven and the smell is just peachy. The aroma that fills the air just gives the good feeling that I've accomplished something. When they are done, the apple pies disappear in a hurry.  I usually use six to seven red delicious apples in each pie and I always make at least two.  They are also my Dad's favorite.  His Birthday is May 31st and I had made apple pies the day before his birthday.  That morning he had told my mom that he wanted apple pie instead of cake for his birthday.  His wish came true when I came walking in the door with an apple pie in my hand.  I also remember that for thanksgiving, my one brother had to stay home because his kids had the chickenpox so I brought him over apple pie.  I stayed only long enough to tell him Happy Thanksgiving and also long enough for him to tell me thank you and it is the closest to Grandma's pies that will ever be that good.  Now everyone I think expects Apple Pie around the Holidays and my dad on his Birthday.

      I have a dream that one day I will either own my own "PicturePerfect" Studio where I will get all the business I can handle, if not more.  I love to take photos or snapshots of anything and everything.  Sometimes, I wonder how I will ever get all the pictures organized that I already have.    I did start a Creative Memories class but shortly  after beginning that I moved back to my hometown and now I haven't had time to get around to it because creating a special kind of photo is very time-consuming.  I also have a three year old, Riley, who would like to just tear into all my stickers and markers and different jagged scissors I use when working with my pictures so I need to wait until his Dad takes him. By then I'm too tired and  I take time to relax and watch a movie instead. I also have two girls that also keep me very busy.

      What a powerful message!  This is the first time I've read this and was moved by the flowing of this essay.  Not only as a reality, but as a piece of literature.  It impressed me that he chose to connect with people by using familiar terms.  I'm also equally impressed that he balanced the idea of working towards this freedom with caution regarding the path that is taken to reach that freedom.  Some groups will use any means to achieve their goal, which at times defeats the purpose and makes them like those they oppose.

      I found it refreshing that the author states to "give up worrying about image" when writing a familiar essay.  This is something that has plagued me.  It's also nice to hear someone describe what I feel like when I finally do settle down to write the "concentrated mindlessness" that precursors a flow of words.

       I found this essay to be very intersting in a weird way. There was no doubt in my mind how much this child wanted to learn to play pool. I liked how the author told a story that at first seemed inconsequential but then showed how it shaped his entire life. The author also made a point as to how that experience effected him socially. ps this was really done on july 2nd

      " I want to plant them in my world and tenderly care for them, helping them to grow healty and strong. I want them to thrive. For anyone that has ever worked around children this is often the main goal. I know that it has been my goal as a future educator.   My goal is to see the children thrive. But I also want to protect them for the harsh reality that we now live in. I don't belive that at the age of five or even six they should have to understand what an attack on U.S. soil is, abduction, or murder is. Their main concerns should be learning, and interacting with kids their own age. But the reality is in this day and age that is something that they learn. I have worked with many kids through my work study program in high school and I have noticed the importance of how a kid needs to be a kid. A child that is forced to grow up to fast is not healthy for any one exspecially the child. As teachers we should help children to be kids.   They only time that they should be a grown-up is when they are playing dress up and acting like one. Children that have play grown -up to soon is devistating and can even cause problems later in life. When they are actual grown-ups they don't know what the meaning of fun is. All they do is work. Their life turns into work. Trust me that was me a few years ago. I never went out with friends or even to school funtions. I thought to my self why bother. No one at school has the same goals in life as I did. At this time I was also fighting a battle with depression. That had been going on for a while. Then in eight grade I snaped I just could not take it any more.  After spending 48 hours in lock down I took a good long look at my life and the direction that it was headed in and made many changes in my life. Like instead of going out I just wanted time to my self. I had friends but now it seemed that they did not share the same goals as I did. That was until I moved to Bagley and met my two best friends Tarah and Leah they showed me that I should not let my depression get the best of me. They have been through everything with me and they are there when I need someone just to complain to. Just as I am there for them.  Then in 11th grade I started to go up to the elementary school and worked with the kindergardeners on a daily basis this helped me face many of the problems that I was facing because I saw them sruggling and it made me feel better because I could help my self over come my fear by helping them with their's. Weather it be learning to read and write to the simplist task of tieing a shoe. It both of us happy when I helped them learn a skill that they are going to use in everyday day life. So no matter who you are you the simplist way that you can help a child thrive is by just being their to help them if they have a problem.

      While reading "News of The Wild" by Scott Russell Sanders I thought of my uncle Don Adamson and the times we spent together building his cabin in northern Minnesota. Sanders wrote "When America was all wilderness except for occasional villages and orchards and clear fields, a journey of any distance was a serious undertaking." This reminded me of my uncle because we too would take journeys into the wilderness that were sometimes difficult.  I helped my uncle build his cabin far in the deep woods of Minnesota. What made it so difficult is that there are no roads that would allow a standard size vehicle to enter, everything was either brought in by hand or with the use of a four wheeler. During our jouney into the woods, I can recall a feeling of being one with the land. Much of the wood that we used to build this cabin came directly from the forest we cleared in order to make room for the cabin. We spent many back breaking days working and on occasion we would visit the closest town just to take a well needed shower and have a "home" cooked meal. I felt as if I was a pioneer back in the old days.  Sanders essay also reminded me of how our(Caucasian) culture differs is comparison to the Native American culture. He states "We will carry a pouch of tobacco to placate the old water monsters, along with a water-treatment kit to placate the new ones, those poisons and parasites we two-leggeds have flushed into the remotest rivers and lakes." This made me think of how the Native American culture seems to be more in tune with their surroundings. Many Native Americans have beliefs that differ from what society has deemed "the norm". They seem to nurture the land, not taking anything of value from it, leaving it as they found it after they have been there. Whereas the (Caucasian) culture seems to only look at something for their benefit without concern for what could have been, a lasting beauty.

      I have many fond memories of our past Christmas’ as the boys were growing up.  The first Christmas we celebrated after leaving the commune was the first we celebrated as a family.  Asa (the oldest) was about four years old, Nathanael (the second) was two and Matthew (the third) was a little over one year old.  My memories of that first Christmas are vague, we didn’t have a tree or other decorations to make our rented trailer festive.  The following year we were renting a house in the country.  Our marvelous landlord told us we could cut down a Christmas tree anywhere on the 200 acres he owned.  This became a tradition.  Each year Duane and I would bundle up the boys and trek on into the woods in search of a Christmas tree.  The snow wasn’t very deep, but we still needed to help the boys through the deeper places because their tiny legs were short.  To them it seemed as if we’d been walking for hours, but we’d only gone into the woods a couple hundred feet.  That first year we decided to cut down a Balsam pine tree.  We forgot to measure the height we needed so we “eyeballed” it.  The boys were so excited as we dragged the tree back to the house.  They were very tired when we finally got home, but excitement kept them from complaining.  Kicking off their boots, hats, mittens and coats, they waited to see what we would do next.  We still didn’t have many decorations.  A friend had given me some that her mother made in a craft class out of beads and colored pipe cleaners.  Asa made one or two in kindergarten that year too.  I popped lots of popcorn, filling a brown grocery bag with it so we could make a garland.  I remember seeing a popcorn garland in some old movie.  We also picked up some fresh cranberries from the store to put on the garland as well.   Not being sure how to make it, each day I would sit with the boys as they watched a children’s program on TV and string popcorn and cranberries.  Ten popcorn then one cranberry, repeating as many times as needed.  I used a sewing needle and regular sewing thread that was doubled.  When I would run out of thread I simply tied on more.  I started the garland a few days before we got the tree and finished it after I tried it out to see if I needed more.  I actually had too much of the garland and had to cut some off.  After getting the tree up to the house, we realized that it was too tall.  It’s amazing how a tree can look a certain size in the great outdoors and then be a different size when you try to bring it into the house.

      Memories of my neighbors dog came to me after reading "She couldn't bear to see a creature in agony like that." in Annie Dillard's "The Deer At Providencia" It brought back memories of Chelsey, a black labrador retriever that was continually neglected. She was cooped up in a twelve by four foot kennel without ever having the opportunity to be let out to get some well needed exercise. I always felt bad playing with my dog Skippy out in the yard with Chelsey looking on, knowing that she could not come out and have some fun and exercise with us.  I asked on many occasions if I could let her out, or take her for a walk, but her owners wouldn't let me. Those people didn't deserve to have such a beautiful animal. I remember how she would look at me, her big brown eyes gazing for some attention, her ears perked up and head cocked to one side, as if to say, please save me. When I would go to visit with her I would always bring a little something special, a juicy bone, or some leftovers from dinner. I didn't care about her getting fat. She had to enjoy something in life.  That winter I let my dog outside, I could hear Skippy barking from over at Chelsey's kennel. I went to investigate, and found Chelsey breathing very heavily, she had about two inches of snow covering her and she couldn't get up. I picked her up, carried her across the yard trying to go as quickly as possible without making her anymore uncomfortable, I then placed her in my pickup and drove her to the veterinary clinic. I had the doctor look at her, he said that her lungs had filled with fluid due to the lack of shelter in the cold. She was suffering from sever pneumonia.  I notified my neighbors about bringing Chelsey to the veterinarian and about her condition. They thanked me in not so much emotion and went to visit her. I returned to the veterinarians office and checked on Chelsey again before the owners got there, she had not improved. I said my goodbyes, nowing full well that this would be the end of her misery. She was put to sleep.

      Memories of my grandmother's house and the four of us grandchildren playing for hours there, was brought back when reading "Time Keeps On Slipping" by Eric Ostrowski.  When he was young he talked of something he was given by his grandmother at the age of five after finding it "on one of my expeditions in one of her many cupboards."  My three brothers; Ricky, Kenny, Stevie, as they were called then, and I would explore my grandparent’s house and grounds for hours.  There was always something new to discover, some new make believe game to play and enough dirt to cover us from head to toe.  My Aunt Barbara, mother's only sibling, rented a room from my grandparents.  She never married.  We were not allowed to go into her bedroom and I don't believe I ever saw what it looked like.  Years later when my grandparents purchased a different house, she moved out and lived on her own until her early death.

      Within the essay, “In The Garden”, written by Deb Sullivan, there was a statement that I feel has great significance in my life. “I realize that I want to do for Jake and Ben as I do for the plants in my garden. I want to plant them in my world tenderly care for them, helping them to grow healthy and strong. I want to build a fence around them and protect them from the harsh elements of life.” It would be so much easier as a parent to be able to protect our children from anything that hurts or disappoints them. If we could only create a perfect little world for our children filled with love, happiness, success and good fortune. &nbsp;  As a parent of a child with “special needs”, I have found this statement to be true so many times. I have had to stand back and watch my son be disappointed, rejected and taken advantage of. I have watched him try so hard to be just like the other kids but never quite succeed. I have watched him fill out job applications with miss-spelled words and almost impossible to read handwriting, because he wanted to do it all by himself. I have watched his disappointment when the phone did not ring for an interview after all the time spent filling out those applications with the miss-spelled words and the messy handwriting. I have watched him stand in the doorway of the dugout cheering on his baseball team because the coaches would not put him in the game because all they were thinking about was winning. I have listened to the excuses he made for them saying, “It’s okay. There just wasn’t enough time for me to get in the game mom.”   &nbsp;One day I went to pick my son up at school for a doctor’s appointment, he came out of school with different clothes on than he had left the house with. When I asked him what  happened, he informed me that when he got back to his gym locker, his clothes were gone. He had to get dirty clothes out of the lost and found to replace the ones that had been stolen from him. I asked him how that could have happened if he had locked his locker. He said, “I couldn’t get the lock to work so I laid it on top of the locker where it would be safe. I didn’t want the guys to have to wait for me.” He knew I was upset about his missing clothes. He tried to comfort me by saying, “It’s okay mom, someone else must have needed my clothes.” He was so forgiving. Somehow he always finds the positive side of any situation.  As parents, it is our nature to want to protect our children from hurt and disappointment. However by allowing them to experience the hurt and disappointment, it helps them learn to be better people. Our son is compassionate, forgiving and full of never-ending love. He is not judgmental or prejudice. He accepts people for what they are. He survived the harsh elements of life.&nbsp;

      Tracy Olson  College Writing 1  Julie Lundblad  July 28, 2004  Building Fences  “I want to build a fence around them and protect them from harsh elements of life. I want them to thrive.” I think we all want that for our children and for other children as well. I agree with Deb Sullivan essay In the Garden we want to help those children that would like to have someone to believe in them and listen to what they have to say. I want to protect my children from the harshness that they will have to deal with when they get older and meet my ex-husband which is their dad. He has so much hate for me that he can’t see how bad he’s harming the children when he refuses to see them. He believes that the children will be happy to see him with open arms.  &nbsp;After my parents divorce my father also thought that when my brother and I got older we would welcome him open arms. However, I haven’t seen or talked to my dad in three years. I want to give my children the security they need to have a healthy relationship with their partner and their children one day.  There are my children’s friends that have their father’s in their lives and the kid’s are lonely even though their father’s are there. I get a lot of my children’s friends over and the first thing they say to my husband and I is why can’t my parents be just like you guys. These parents sometime forget how they too were once kids and sometimes we get to busy being adults and not thinking about our children, so that they can feel safe and thrive. In a sense we do build that fence, but not the way the children want us to just want us to listen.  We all can build a fence around anything but we need compassion behind it and we need to let them breath fresh air, if not when they break down that fence look out. My niece’s parents have build fences so high for her that it turned out to be more harmful, she can’t wait until she’s 18 years old and she has told her parents that she is moving out because they have build fences to protect her and they were too high. My niece can’t do the same things as most kids. She’s 15 years old and she can not take a walk around her block because her parents think that someone might kidnap her, however my son who is 13 years old walk home from the middle school dance and home is by the mall. She is also not allowed to walk to the skating rink from my house.  I have a teenager that we had in our home for the past 3 months that had to adjust being in our home that has structure. &nbsp;Before, his mom really didn’t care where he was just as long as he was home at night. He chose to live with us because we have showed our kids we care. The relative he was staying with drank a lot, and he didn’t like that live style there. I hope that we have given him something to carry out in his life when he leaves next Monday, hopefully he will thrive in life and know that someone does care.

      “One prisoner had been brought out of his cell.” This statement came from A Hanging. This statement ties into my essay in the end of how I am the prisoner that gets out of his cell.  I am a prisoner. I am the soul person responsible for this miserable crime. My crime is leading a life that I can’t seem to break out of. It is a life of being alone, sad and with drawn from the world of a normal person. This life is a cell; I live in it and hide behind it. My cell is the cell of not a normal person would want. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  My mind stirs thoughts of being normal. My face has scares from the beatings I took as a child. My dad would get mad when he was drunk and he would beat me til I bleed. The day I became a prisoner and was put in this cell is when I killed my father. My father came home drunk that day and was filled with anger and he went right for me, but this time I took one of his guns and shot him several times til he fell to the floor.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This day I became a prisoner, my miserable crime of killing my father wasn’t a crime but a defense of not getting beat another time. My cell is ten by ten and has a toilet and a bunk bed in it. I sit in my cell day after day and think of that day I became a prisoner. I ponder how I can break out of my cell and think how nice it would be to lead a normal life. But, while I sit in my cell I hide behind these walls and I feel alone, not just not having another inmate in my cell but feeling alone from not being able to experience a normal life.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ten years have went by and the warden came to my cell and told me I was free for my case was reopened and I was free because I killed my father out of defense. My cell is just a cell now and I am free to be normal now. It is great to be free but I still feel alone because I am scared for life.

      There is a part in Judith Viorsts' essay, "WHAT ME? SHOWING OFF?" that caught my eye.&nbsp; This part is "showoffs always run the risk of being thought immodest, of being harshly viewed as...well...showoffs.  This brought me back to high school where a classmate of mine was the one showing off.&nbsp; This was especially true in volleyball and it didn't help that the coach&nbsp;showed favortism toward her.&nbsp; This gave her more room to show off with spiking the volleyball.  She was good at everything.&nbsp; She had good grades, voted for as homecoming queen, well-liked and popular, also a showoff.&nbsp; She was a big time showoff and everyone in our class knew it.&nbsp; There was no competing with her.&nbsp; She was known to many as a class pet to most of the teachers.  Now older, I see her showing off is not as bothersome&nbsp;to me as it&nbsp;used to be in high school.&nbsp; I think being older has changed my perspective as she&nbsp;just has more money and is spoiled.&nbsp;   The old version I find her being the teacher's pet in almost every class.&nbsp; The new version is I still find her snobbish, at times.&nbsp; I find her&nbsp;to now be active&nbsp;in enjoying life and helping out society in a way that makes her feel a part of good in herself such as painting smiley faces on kids at the carnivals or Sunday school teacher and helping out with vacation bible school.&nbsp;   I&nbsp;think we all find our way of showing off from time to time, sometimes in a good&nbsp;way and sometimes not in a good way.&nbsp; Most of us, I think, just want someone to appreciate us for who we are.&nbsp; Some of us are more modest in our showing off and some of us seem to flaunt showing&nbsp;off more than others.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tend to find myself in the modest part where my classmate is the one to flaunt herself.

      Amanda Pickerell    July 28, 2004 Julie Lundblad Springboard essay 1                                                 Far From Perfect You used to see them every day. They used to be the people that everyone admired. Their son was the captain of the football team and their daughter was the cheerleading captain. Dad worked from 9 to 5 Monday through Friday, and Mom made Turkey for dinner and Apple Pie for desert. “The Perfect Family”, the family that everyone wanted to be in.           We often see other people’s families in very different eye’s than we see our own. We see the Mom that makes fresh baked cookies every week. We see milk that is delivered to their door step. We see the kids with 4.0 grade point averages. We may even see the Dad coming home from work to a hot meal and a back rub by his ever devoted wife. Maybe our best friend is the Cheerleading Captain. Maybe we work with the Dad. Whatever part we have in one of the family member’s lives we still see the “Roses that grow by the door step.”           But there are things that we dont see. Like when the daughter ends up pregnant at 16 or when the son is heavy into drugs or alchohol abuse. We can't see the mom being abused by her husband or the dad being laid off of work. Althought this is a worst case scenario, it is a good example of the things that we dont see because we dont want to see. also the other people dont want to have us see the imperfections in their perfect lives. They can sweep it under the carpet. As do all families. We all have things to hide. THe question here is, do you hide your problems and never solve them or do you display it for all to see.           Alice Hoffman’s Essay “The Perfect Family” tells us what it was like fifty years ago, and how every family was portrayed as. “When I was growing up in the 50’s there was only one sort of family, the one we watched on television every day. Right  in front of us, in black and white, was everything we needed to know about family  values: the neat patch of lawn, the apple tree, the mother who never once raised her voice, the three lovely children: a Princess, a Kitten, a Bud and, always, the father who knew best.” She knew then that all of the families were not perfect. However that is how all people saw other families. WHen her parents got a divorce, their problems were not as easily hidden. She shares that “I did not meet another child of divorced parents until 10 years later when I went off the college.”           It is said now that one in two marriages will end in either divorce or a legal separation. Our world is no longer seemingly perfect. We have mothers that have children out of wedlock and fathers that are alcoholics. Every day we see stories of children that do not have enough food for them to eat. We also see violence on TV, newspapers, radio, and most recently the internet. A person can find recipes for homemade bombs and other such violent weapons. Just three years ago we saw Terrorists fly loaded planes full of innocent people into the World trade Center.          The interesting thing about all of these problems that we see now is that it was the same way then as it is now. There were fathers that cheated on their wives and Children starved every day. We were fighting wars then and we were shown violence then too. What made the difference then? Why did we not see all of the same problems then. IT might be because it was not "acceptable" then. It was seen as different or abnormal. when did it become a normal occurance for families to break apart and destroy any children in that family? The moest important question here is : Why do we see all of our problems now, and why couldnt we see them fifty years ago?           THE actual truth of the matter is that we had the same problems. we saw the same things. It was not acceptable then. Even though times have changed and our standards have for some reason gone down, we also have some things that have changed for the  good. Anyone that wants to can go to college and get a degree. WHites and blacks can eat in the same restureaunt, and people can fall in love an not have to worry if they are in the same social class. Instead of dwelling on the negitive things, why dont we stop and think about all of the things that we take for granted. Just take the time to stop and smell the roses.

We will glance by and pretend that we didn’t see them. They make us uncomfortable. They look at us, unashamed, and yet we will not look back. We are ashamed.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are the homeless people that we see going around street corners and sitting on the cracked sidewalks. They are the people that we look at and even look through. They are the bums, the refuse of our society, the blemishes on our perfect little communities. We see them as the embodiment of disgrace, human life at its lowest form. We don’t question why they are here; we’re sure that it was by some unlawful act of laziness that they find themselves in such a position.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though in our minds we are sure of this, we are ashamed. We are ashamed to be driving by in our cars, holding our Styrofoam container of leftovers from the restaurant we just left. We are unsettled by their presence, they make us feel guilty. We get angry at them. We worked hard for what we have and we deserve it. How dare these faces, these unfamiliar faces, make us feel guilty. The nerve of these people. After all, they’re living the way they are because of their mistakes, right? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We release our anger and self assurance and continue to drive by, to walk by. We won’t meet their gaze, it makes us uncomfortable. We begin to wonder how cold it will get tonight. We wonder if they have people to talk with or if they will try to sleep in silence. Will they find a crevice of some rare trod street to curl up in? Or has dignity left so long ago that they feel no need to hide themselves. Will they choose the more sheltered area under the storefront awning though it is more exposed to the critical eye of the public? We wonder this as we turn the radio up in our luxury vehicles.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The noise distracts you, distracts you from feeling that dangerous feeling that you’ve tried to fight off every time you drive in this part of town. But this time the music doesn’t soothe, it makes you think. Thinking can be very dangerous.  You try to find another avenue of thought to stroll down, but those eyes haunt you. You made the mistake; you looked into that person’s eyes as you were driving by. You knew better than to do that, but you did it anyway. Now those eyes stare at you, though they don’t see you anymore.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You turn off the radio. It isn’t distracting anymore, at least not in the way you want it to be. Now it is almost taunting you, mocking your conscience. It points its nonexistent finger at you. It knows why you turned it on and that exposure makes you nervous. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see these people. I don’t see them often, but their plight I can feel. I wonder if they know people drive by them and feel sorry for them. Would they appreciate the thought? Would they shudder to know that people look down on them as unfortunate, the fateful chosen ones of Life.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I try to put myself in their shoes, but it is impossible. I want to know, but I am scared to know. Could I handle the truth? Could I be so open to what they could share with me that I would truly be able to comprehend? I don’t think so. I cannot look out at the world from their perspective. I cannot know what it is like to sleep on cement slabs with the rain trailing down me and know that I have no place to go to dry off. I cannot look out at the world through their eyes. Oh, those eyes. They follow me. Oh please, look anywhere but here.

      &nbsp; I Want a Husband. I am free and miserable trying to find my soul mate and when I find a husband he will do everything or at least make his wife happy. As I wash clothes one day it appeared in my mind of my good friend who got married a couple years ago and now him and his wife are expecting there first child. Why does this strike me so well is because I see things that I want in a husband. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I want a husband who will support me with money. I want a husband that understands when I say things should be split 50/50. I want a husband that will cook for me when I am not up to it, he will massage my feet when I come home after a hard days work. I want a husband who will make sure the dishes are done when I have no time to do them and he will do this for me without me asking. I want a husband that will clean up after himself, this is hard to find but all men are trainable. I want a husband that does not need to be told to put the toilet seat down. I want a husband that will make time for me without making excuses because he is to busy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I want a husband that will take care of my children when I need a break from life. I want a husband that with take care of my physical needs. I want a husband that will not complain when he feels that he is doing more then me. I want a husband that will take care of me when I am ill, he will bring me to my doctor’s appointments and he will miss work if I want him to be home to take care of my ailing body. I want a husband that will not be jealous of my male friends. I want a husband who will listen to my problems and try to help me solve them without getting frustrated. I want a husband that will make sure there is food on the table, and to make sure the children are fed and in bed on time.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I want a husband that will take care of the arrangements when we go out on the town. I want a husband who is sensitive to my sexual needs, a husband that will make love to me passionately and eagerly and &nbsp;be worried about my needs and not his. And, of course I want a husband that will understand and not pout when I am not in the mood for him. I want a husband that will just give me the love and support he knows he wants in return.   Who woundn't&nbsp;want a husband who can give her all these things?

      Jennifer Parkhurst Springboard 1 Julie Lundblad July 28, 2004 “His pain is over.” I read One Hour by Kim Dennig. It was a touching story of losing a family member. I like the emotion and the love he had for his grandfather. Ever since I was very young I’ve had an interest in nursing.&nbsp; I remember when my grandpa passed away when I was eight years old.&nbsp; I thought to myself that if I was a nurse maybe I could have helped him.&nbsp; At the young age of eight, I realized death is forever. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was twenty I began working as a nurse’s aid.&nbsp; I worked at Havenwood Care Center in Bemidji.&nbsp; I worked at the nursing home for two and half years.&nbsp; As a nurses aid I helped the elderly residents with their activities of daily living.&nbsp; Many of the residents come to the nursing home.&nbsp; They come to live out the rest of their lives in nursing homes.&nbsp; It was difficult because they could no longer take care of themselves at home.&nbsp; Their skin was fragile, and sensitive. Some residents had dementia and Alzheimer patients.&nbsp; I enjoyed visiting them at supper time and I would talk to the residents that could not speak although the other staff would not.&nbsp; I just hope someone would talk to me if I could not speak. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was frequently asked to stay over.&nbsp; Although, exhausted from working the evening shift, I would stay and help. First, rounds at one a.m. involved a lot of lifting and turning patients.&nbsp; We would answer lights and take turns taking residents to the restroom.&nbsp; Rounds went by fast and it kept me from being sleepy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At three a.m. it was time to round again. Half way though rounds I checked the lady in the second bed, and I found something shocking.&nbsp; I turned on the light and noticed the woman’s skin was yellow and cold.&nbsp; Her eyes were open, and her leg was hanging over the bed as if she was trying to get up. I said her name but she did not answer me.&nbsp; Just two hours ago I had spoken to this lady and she said, “So is it time to get up.”&nbsp; Wow, this was the first person I had actually found dead.&nbsp; I felt very confused and I felt like this wasn’t real.&nbsp; I had no idea this would have such an emotional impact on me. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found it was hard to deal with at first, I couldn’t forget how scary she looked lying in bed starring.&nbsp; I didn’t know if I would be able to continue to work in this field but as they say time heals all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today I am working at Cass lake Public Health Services hospital. Although people die there too, I am gaining experience in a variety of areas.&nbsp; Now I have three children and I cherish each day that I am able to play with, feed, and provide for, there for them because someday I too will be old.

      The essay I read by Judy Brady, was very interesting. I thought the lady wanting a wife. But it showed the different views of a mother/wife. I believe she is right that women do alot of things in a family setting. Maybe I should have my boyfriend read this essay.

      I was just asking a girlfriend today (a few years younger than I) what she thought we'd be like as little old ladies.&nbsp; Reading this story is like other's I've read and it make me cringe to think that someday I may need this type of attention.&nbsp; I am glad that my mother, because of alzheimer's, didn't know where she was when we put her in a home.&nbsp; I'm also thankful that I never had to do that with my father.&nbsp; This story definately makes me think of my future and how I would like it to be shaped and what I will do about that while I can.

       What a novel idea!&nbsp; Being both wife and mother I found great pleasure in reading this essay by Judy Brady.&nbsp; I love her idea, the way she put it across.&nbsp; Even now with my children grown and on their own, I'm still a wife and student.&nbsp; It would be nice as she said, "I want a wife who will listen to me when I feel the need to explain a rather difficult point I have come across in my course of studies."&nbsp; Among other parts of her idea, this will all too soon be a reality as I hit school full time next semester.

      We try to raise our kids to just walk away. Stanton was raised that way and sometimes when we have had a enough we fight back. I think anyone would feel good about fighting back when they had no choice.&nbsp;However that good&nbsp;feeling is temporary.   We are taught not to fight back, yet there is a certain satisfaction in retaliating. Then our hearts take over and we know hurting someone only hurts us.&nbsp;

      At first, I was wondering why would a woman want a wife. Then, when I read this essay I thought this was the way I felt. I had to read it to my husband you would think he would say something, NO!! He didn't, &nbsp;you would think that would of made him say hey I'm sorry that you would need a wife. I will start helping out, but No!!   A lot&nbsp;of women can sympathize with Judy some women have husbands that seem to take us for granted and don't understand what we really go though. We work harder then we do in the workforce, we sometimes work or even go to school and they still expect us to do everything. I think we should have this put into a poster to have hanging where our men can see it so they can be reminded how much we do for them.

      This essay made me aware of what is going on in the inside of Anna Mae.&nbsp; I think that we overlook and are not sensitive to the thoughts and feelings of the aged.&nbsp; We can see by the outside that there is graying, wrinkling, aging, sagging, crippling, and decaying and assume subconsciously that that defines the person as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp; When in fact that that is not always the case, there may be the mind of a 30 year old in the body of a 84 year old.&nbsp;   This essay will relate to my reality in the way that I will be more sensitive and understanding of the elderly in my personal and professional life.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Blogging of “I Want a Wife”  This essay is a realistic look at the life of a wife.&nbsp; When I had first read this essay it seemed to me that there was a tone of what is labeled as “man bashing”.&nbsp; In reading it a second and third time, the tone changed.&nbsp; When she says, “As I thought about him while I was ironing one evening…” it sounds as if it is a matter of fact kind of thought.&nbsp; She wasn’t angry or resentful, she was quietly ironing.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Her repetition of the “I want a wife” separates the activities, duties, jobs, and life of a wife.&nbsp; I think that if she didn’t have this repetition that all of these things would blend into one another and lose the effect of exactly how many things a wife does.  I can relate to this essay.&nbsp; This essay is me.&nbsp; I am a wife and a mom.&nbsp; I realized what it is that I do.&nbsp; I know what I do, but have thought about it all separately.&nbsp; When it is put down in black and white, in one essay, it is more powerful.&nbsp; The life of a wife is a tremendous task and I would expect that the burnout rate would be high and if it isn’t, why?&nbsp; I would be interested to know what it was that she felt after the realization of what her life entailed. &nbsp;Did she accept this description and continue to live her life this way, was she angry, or did life change in her marriage and her relationship with her husband, with regards to equality. &nbsp;&nbsp;This essay should be a mandatory read for husbands to be!&nbsp;&nbsp;

      The author, Anna Mae Halgrim Seaver, is giving a detailed description of what her life is like in a nursing home in the essay, "My World Now. Throughout the essay, she describes how she has lost her privacy, independence and her freedom. She describes how one mundane day leads into another without any variation. Because one day is just like the next, it is difficult for her to know what day of the week it is. She talks about the residents with Alzheimer's who are not aware of where they are. I wonder if she isn't a little envious that they are not aware of their fate.   The author talks about the fact that even the employees don't stay long because it is not a desirable place to work.&nbsp;She states, "This is not the best job to have." They can move on to a better place of employment but she cannot.   My heart goes out to the author. Because people are living longer these days, they are often times unable to take care of themselves as they get older. Family structure is different today with both parents working and leading busy lives. The elderly can depend on their families to take care of them. They are forced to go to some kind of care facility to live out their days. They loose everything they have worked so hard for, even their privacy. I don't know what the answer is, I only know that my heart breaks every time I must go visit someone in the nursing home.

      In this essay written by Deborah Tannen pointed out that we as society go out of are way to pick weaak points out of a person speaking. This is more so with the media, even though we all have the freedom of speech. The media itself does pick a person more so then a regular person on the way they speak our what they have to say. Even I sit and listen to one talk I am not listening to what they have to say but what there weaknesses are in the story.

      After reading this essay I got a feeling that Judy Brady was getting the point across as a idea that all men want the same things in a wife and that if she wanted a wife, she would have her wife do the same thing as she stated in the essay. I though have to disagree with her essay for I think anyone and myself should let his wife do what she wants and make things 50/50 across the board in marrige.

      After reading "Fighting Back", written by Stanton L. Wormley, JR., I wondered what I would have done if I had been in his position.&nbsp; I would have probably handled things the same way that the author did. The author was raised in a "upper-middle-class black family" which tells us that life was different for him than other black people from the start. The author did not hold the resentment, anger and frustration that many poor black people hold. He did not have to fight for everything he had. Because of his social class, the author was not angry at all white men. He did not feel the contempt for the white man that the other black soldiers did. He felt like he was an equal to the white man which is why he did not fight back when first attacked.   I think the idea the author was trying to convey was that he almost felt ashamed for not fighting back in the first fight. He questioned his response to the fight wondering "Was I less of a man for not having beaten my attacker to a bloody pulp?" Self-defense and active and defiant fighting back were the two reasons the author felt&nbsp;that fighting back was justified. He felt that "fighting back" for the black man and other minority groups was a "statement of individual potency and self-determination." The author understood that by not fighting back, he had disgraced the entire black population.   In the authors second fight he did choose to fight back. I think he fought back because of all the guilt he had harbored&nbsp;from disgracing his people years ago and also, he was probably more aware of the discrimination that his people and other minority groups experience after serving in the military. He had experienced life other than the upper-middle class life he was accustomed to.   I found that I had great respect for the author admitting that after his second fight, he felt a "great sense of hollowness." Even though he was justified in retaliating and initially exhilarated by the fight, he did not like that he had become like the "others" and learned to fight back. What a good lesson that fighting never solves problems. No matter what.

      After reading "I Want a Wife", written by Judy Brady, I got the distinct idea that the author was feeling taken advantage of by her husband. Throughout the essay, she gave many examples of all the things that she would like a wife to do if she could have one. I think that what she was really saying is that she wanted some recognition and appreciation for all the things she does for everyone else on a daily basis. She wanted someone to pamper her and make sure that everything was taken care of for her.   I think the idea of this essay is to make us aware of all the things the "woman" or "wife" is expected to do for the family. Why is it the wife that always has to make the sacrifices? Why is it the wife that thinks of everyone else first?   This essay is so typical of families today. There are certainly exceptions to this stereo-typical relashionship between husband and wife, but for the most part, I am sure that a lot of "wives" can relate to what the author is talking about.   I liked the way the author ended the essay. I think what she was saying was, not only did her husband not appreciate her and all she does for him and the family, but he expects more. Somehow her husband puts no importance on his wives wants and desires. I never thought about it, but maybe I would like a wife also.&nbsp; :)   &nbsp;

      Inthis essay by Deborah Tannen She points out how as a society we like to argue in order to get our way. And that the media often does not give to side to an issue. Because they want to have you side with them. Which I think is wrong because how can we as a society make a fair judgement when we are only hearing half of the story. Even on talk shows people like to argue I think somethings they do this just to get attention. Why would you want to argue just to argue. It is a waste of time and of energy. And after a while no one wants to listen to you because all you want to do to them is have a fight and this is not right to the other person or people involved. We all argue. But arguing all the time is not good for your selfesteam and it make make people around you negative also. It can lead to anxity, depression, spouse abuse, child abuse and much more. I think this is one of the main problems in are society to day is that we can't talk problems out without someone yelling at the other person and this hurts everyone involved not just the people&nbsp; who are disagreing with each other.

      In this &nbsp;essay by Judy Brandy the author explains how a friend of hers recently got divorced, and had a child from a previous marriage and they got to talking and he told her that he wanted a new wife. That got Judy thinking how she wants a different wife.  One that will do everything a wife is suppoes to do while the husband is out making a living for the family. Well the reason that Judy wants a new wife is because she is doing everything including the man's job and that is not easy. In this essay I think that Brandy teaches you that the women should not have to do everything at home. But in many cases this is just the case. Well both parents may be working outside the home. The mother is mainly responsible for taking care of everything at home. It is not like women can't do anything that men can't but many think the "Leave it to Beaver" way. Where the mother is at home and may work outside the home occassional. While it is the fathers responsiblity to earn the living for the family. Leaving all the household duties to mom. I don't think this is right just because we have been classified as the more materinal gender. It would not kill a man to help out around the house. After all he lives there to. Even everyone in awhile take care of the inner family needs like making sure the kids are taken care of, appointments are scheduled, and even the housework is done. Many Women would apperciate this.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ideas I found in this essay writtne by Wormley, FIGHTING BACK, were drama and race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was treated unfairly because of the color of his skin.&nbsp; I just hate that.&nbsp; The drama I found was in his will not to fight back because this is how he was brought up.&nbsp; When confronted byanother black man of why he chose not to was something that he hadn't thought of.&nbsp; It hadn't entered his mind.&nbsp; The drama also was hitting the next guy in the stomach when he wouldn't leave him alone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When translating this to reality, I find black race are not treated equal yet.&nbsp; I feel white people have more rights yet and the black race fights twice as hard as white people to prove themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a friend who transferred to my shool during the teen years.&nbsp; Noone seemed to want to help her find the classrooms.&nbsp; I helped her and we are friends to this day.&nbsp; She is native american and actually helped my self-esteem improve.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The author, Stanton L. Wormley, Jr. in his essay, FIGHTING BACK, talks of his difficult upbringing as an only child and he still was adjusting, at eighteen, when he was an army private at Fort Jackson, S.C. where a drunken white soldier attacked him during his sleep and the thought of fighting back had not entered his mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, he was confronted angrily by a young black street wise soldier wondering why he didn't fight back.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a roadside diner in Virginia, Wormley was confronted again by a drunken white man making derogatory remarks at him.&nbsp; He did try ignore him and move but the man grabbed his shoulder.&nbsp; He pulled him up out of his chair and hit the drunk guy in the stomack, dropping him to the floor.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He thought of how this left him feeling good for the moment and then lost something by leaving him with a hollow feeling afterwards.&nbsp; In his upbringing, he was taught to think more than react.&nbsp; Fighting disgraced his black american population.&nbsp; He had a trace of sadness in knowing he had learned to fight back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found this essay sad in some parts.&nbsp; By this I am referring to race.&nbsp; It shouldn't matter what color you are.&nbsp; Wormley was judged by that; his color.&nbsp; I find this wrong.&nbsp; He was trying to do good for himself and drunken white ment were in the wrong by attacking him.&nbsp; They're the ones making white people look bad.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The author, Judy Brady, in I WANT A WIFE, is good.&nbsp; I can see her point.&nbsp; As a mother, why not have someone, anyone to take care of us for a change. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This essay makes her sound unhappy&nbsp; and exhaused in her role as a mother.&nbsp; She is ironing and what comes to her mind is, "Yeah, why not get or have a wife?"&nbsp; She's thinking of her divorced friend and sees why he wants someone.&nbsp; To take care of his needs and his one child.&nbsp; She almost sounds angry or bitter at the role she plays because I think her duties are unappreciative in her household. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, I'd like a wife too.&nbsp; In reality, it is a fifty-fifty deal to me.&nbsp; Working together, because an income now-a-days takes two people to make it in this world today and with that I would say, "IT TAKES TWO!" to accomplish the routine of everyday life.&nbsp; When both making incomes, there needs to be an agreeable arrangement of working together in the home equally, as partners so transitions can run smoothly as possible.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The auther, Judy Brady, in I WANT A WIFE, starts out&nbsp; with a male friend, recently divorced, who has one child with his ex-wife and now looking for another wife. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She goes on talking of how she thought of him when ironing one night and how she'd like a wife for herself, meaning for someone to take care of her and run errands, keeep track of dental and doctor appointments, mend clothes, feed kids, arrange school events, take them to the park and so on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While reading this essay, I found her repetition in wanting a wife mentioned over and over again.&nbsp; Things such as, "I want a wife to take care&nbsp;of my children," or "I want a wife who takes care of the children when they are sick," or "I want a wife who will take care&nbsp;of the babysitting arrangements or wanting a wife who is faithful, honest, entertains, and is a good cook. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This essay sounds like the woman is the jack of all trades and does more than a man has to.&nbsp; In the world today,&nbsp; this essay leaves the reader with false accusations.&nbsp; In the way wives nurture others, I find this si habit in being brought up.&nbsp; Today, roles have changes with the mother working and the father watching and raising kids.&nbsp; Today, it is whatever works out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people are single parents, such as myself, doing the "Mr. Mom."&nbsp; Every household is different so this essay I find distracting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It sounds like she is unhappy in her role of motherhood.&nbsp; I think, by nature, mothers are nurturers at heart.&nbsp; Most of us are.&nbsp; I believe some of it comes natural. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a single parent, it is oberbearing at times but I love my kids.&nbsp; They have responsibility with helping when I haven't a spouse to rely on.&nbsp; Sometimes that would be nice.&nbsp; I've adjusted to the single parent role.&nbsp; I may not always like it but I do what I can.

      In this essay, Anna Mae Halgrim Seaver is writing from how she see's her world now, compares to before. She writes about the treatment she gets while living where she does, and how it makes her feel less like a human. She explains how she spends a typical day, either in bed or watching T.V. Anna explains what happens when people die and how it's just like another day for the workers, and she also tells about the comforts of the wheelchair.  I like this essay because it's not a essay thats all complaining. As a reader I can tell she's not complaining, she's just trying to open others eyes as to how she feels and how she's treated now that she's in a nursing home. She tells about her world before and how it is now. I can tell she excepts why she's there, it's just hard to except how she's treated.

      Judy Brady wrote this essay from a wives perspective of a wife. More so of wife, writing from how she is seen by her husband eyes. She writes from how she feels he sees her, and wants her to act. After reading this essay "I Want A Wife" the reader can tell that this relationship isn't a two way ordeal, it's more of the wife doing all the giving and the husband doing all the recieving. Basically the only similarities betweent them are that they both are living for "him". She's working to care for him, and so is he. For most women this essay could be quite similar to their own lives, how the husband are so dependant upon their wives.Growing up and seeing how my parents are together, I can say this essay is nothing like them. My parents are equal with everything, they share all the responsibilities, and really respect eachother.  I liked this essay because it was true. It was written from experience, and after reading it, I could tell that the writer wrote this because she needed to get her feelings out. She probable felt it was the only way she could be heard, and understood.

      Anna Mae Halgrin Seaver's Essay My World Now shares the life of an 84 year old woman in a nursing home. she shares her feelings on being old and how she feels neglected and how her feelings do not seem to matter.I think the tone of this essay is one of reflection. The woman in&nbsp; the essay is sharing how she feels to have everything taken away from her.&nbsp; TO be put into a place where she is forced to have a roommate and when there is nothing to live for anymore. When she was counting the minutes till lunch i thinkthat it was the writers way of really making us see howlife was for her in a nursing home. I dont think that i could be happy in a home. I am a free spirited person and i dont want anyone to take that away from me. They cant.

      In the Essay I Want aWife, the author Judy Brady, Writes of her experiences as a wife and a woman. I think that she is trying to share her feelings on the work that is required of her as a woman. I think that the ideas in this essay are trying to portray How she is tired of being the one in her family to do all of the work. I thinkthat a woman should be more than a mom and a nurse. The woman's job is becoming more flexible and less restrictive. I think that brady's essay is one that shows how she feels when all things are said and done.

      I found this essay to be weird, although I loved the way Cynthia Williams, the author described her experiences with garbage. I guess I can see what she is talking about, how the garbage itself is lonely. I can only imagine that she herself must be lonely. Although I do believe that she may require some psychiatric help, she does have a way with garbage and how it relates to her life, first coming and then going. I do believe that we all should take the resposibility for our waste. But I don't believe that one should thrive in it.

      I found this essay to be very one sided. The author Judy Brady was simply trying to state every aspect of a womans life that chooses to be this way, bitter. I'm sorry she's not appreciated, she chooses to have these feelings on the basis of her mate. I have not, and do not condone the way the author speaks in this essay because she obviously thinks she is much more than equal to a male. She has deffinatley made some bad decisions in her life if she thinks that all of the things she describes are of her&nbsp;own responsibility. She makes me mad to think that there are people out there that have no respect, either for themselves or their mate. I believe that a relationship is a 50/50 venture and that in itself deserves respect.

      I liked this essay because I can incorporate the idea of him wanting to retaliate. He doesn't retaliate the first time because he was raised not to. His idea is when do we retaliate and what does it take for us not to retaliate? I think that retaliation is something we all fight as a silent battle within each and all of us. I know I do. I am made fun of, talked about at worked, teased, and meant to feel bad. This man feels the same way because of his color. He is proud of being black but everyone else is scared because of his color. People are afraid of the unknown. This man was the stronger man because he didn't fight back the first time but when he fought back the second time he felt ashamed because he had let the monster fighting inside out to show his true feelings of what he feels about people who retaliate against black people just because they are black.

      This essay made me mad. I read this essay at least three times and the more I read it the more it made me angry. First of all at the beginning of this essay I couldn't decide if this author was male or female it really was a confusing idea. The idea of this essay was wanting a wife because of what duties a wife has or takes on in her role as a wife. I think that the author to this essay was basically bringing out the sterotypes put on wives. I am a wife and I don't do all those things all the time. My husband shares the responsibility or we take turns. This essay sounds like it's from&nbsp;a males perspective who wants to be free and wants a mother not a wife someone to wait on him hand and foot so he can take credit for the wife's hard work while he just looks important. This was not a good essay I feel because he makes it sound like the old days when the wife used to do it all and that is the way it is now. Well it's not. It takes two to run a household and the household shares all the responsibility of running the house.

      Deborah Tannen, the author of this essay, presents all the ways that people try be a critic. One example is how the media preys on public interest by posing difficult questions which catch the interviewees off guard. When we as listeners hear these questions, we assume this is the generally held opinion of our society.  &nbsp;She points out that the path to truth is not necessarily as easy as it appears. There are many ways we try to get there, including public discourse, finding the weak spots in the people you are debating and trying to find “the other side.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is definitely an easy essay to relate to the real world. Face it, we do these things. We argue just to argue. We attack another’s point of view just because it doesn’t tango with ours. We even lie sometimes because we are just so sure we know the other person is not telling the truth. We can have no way of knowing for sure what another is thinking or that they are intentionally lying. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I loved the illustration of the irate talk show guest. I have always been disgusted with anger-driven talk shows where none of the issues are really presented and it’s all a bunch of screaming fanatics who don’t listen to a single word of what the other person is saying, except to attack it and call them raving lunatics. It’s sad that it has gotten to this point. People don’t want to hear both sides, they want to see these “distinguished guests” holler near obscenities at each other. Arguing for just for the sake of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Justification for inappropriate behavior. The first paragraph illustrated this. When a journalist was asked why she had to attack others so she could be right, she replied, “It’s an argument.”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This essay got me thinking about my own life personally. I don’t want to end up a bitter old woman with opinions so set that she is blinded to what might really be true. I liked this lengthy line, “But when opposition becomes the overwhelming avenue of inquiry, when the lust for opposition exalts extreme views and obscures complexity, when our eagerness to find weaknesses blinds us to strengths, when the atmosphere of animosity precludes respect and poisons our relations with one another, then the culture of critique is stifling us.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It really sums up the whole point of his essay. I’m not sure if this is what Julie meant by putting the ideas behind essays into real life. Sorry if I misunderstood!

      In this essay by Judy Brady, she tells all the reasons that she would personally want a wife. Being a wife, she wishes SHE had a wife to do all of the things that she has to do. I get the impression that she really doesn't like her position in the family. Obviously she has some pride in what (or rather, how many things) she does, but she doesn't seem to get much appreciation. In a way she is presenting her own life through her husband's eyes and I have a feeling all is not well in paradise. &nbsp;This essay is probably well received by many wives. I am not a wife myself (hallelujah, a shaft of light and angelic voices), but I liked it. I get mad at myself when I take my mother for granted and just basically anyone in my life. And it's so doggon easy to do. &nbsp;&nbsp; Many wives probably feel this way. Problem after problem arises and they are expected to handle it because the man has been "working all day." It's a pity that this author felt so frustrated that she had to write something like this. It's a pity she felt she needed a wife. It's a pity she felt unappreciated and harried. I'm sure Brady voiced what many women wish to voice. But I wonder, how many men are feeling this way, too? The grass is always greener.........

      Anna Mae Halgrim Seaver’s essay “My World Now” is a very insightful essay about the treatment of elderly people in nursing homes. It also allows us to see what people in nursing home are thinking day to day. Seaver exposes the idea that nursing homes are very lonely, not very dignifying, and very boring.  &nbsp;  All of these ideas go through my very own head at work everyday. I work in a nursing home and often wonder how boring it must be. Everything seems to be revolved around breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, and finally another snack. Seaver’s expresses this when she describes her day of getting up early, waiting for breakfast and then pondering waiting in the dining room for lunch. Obviously she feels that there is not much to look forward to during the day other then the meals that are served.  &nbsp;  Seaver expresses the idea that aides in a nursing home don’t take time to listen. I know that this is a fact. Many times, I find that we are very short on help and even though we would like to take time to chat, we just don’t have that luxury. I feel it a tragedy that we are forced to run around like chickens with our heads cut off when all these people want most of the time is someone to listen. I also think that people are encouraged not to get too close to the resident by spending a lot of time with them. I have had experiences where I was taking the extra few minutes that I had to visit with a certain resident who was telling me all about his kids. When I was spotted doing this by a co worker, I was told that I shouldn’t get so close. I didn’t look at this as getting close; I looked at it as caring.  &nbsp;  Overall the feelings that are expressed in this essay are very much valid. I can not imagine having to live in an environment like a nursing home especially if I had my mind about me as Seaver does in this essay.

      As I read the essay, “My World Now,” I was compelled to think of the people that I see everyday at work. I work in a nursing home and can relate to the things that this lady is experiencing. I often wonder what these people did or enjoyed when they were younger. Many times while working though, we as aides unfortunately don’t have the time to stop and ask or listen as we would like. I find it refreshing to have a day when we are not short of help on the floor and can spend the time that is deserved these people under our care.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I Want a Wife” written by Judy Brady is an essay that seems to rally for sympathy for wives. Brady explains throughout the essay all of the reasons that she would want a wife and what she would expect them to do. She also writes that if she had a wife she would have the right to find a new wife if she so desired. I get the feeling that Brady, a wife herself, does not like the position that she is in.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a very strong idea presented in this essay that wives have many expectations placed on them by there spouse, family, and society. These expectations are expressed in a negative way in this essay. For two entire pages Brady writes phrases and ideas such as, “I want a wife who will take care of my physical needs. I want a wife who will keep my house clean.” “I want a wife who is sensitive to my sexual needs, a wife who makes love passionately and eagerly when I feel like it, a wife who makes sure that I am satisfied.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t feel that there is anything wrong in wanting a wife to do these things. However, I get the feeling from this essay that Brady does not get the same respect from her spouse as she is expected to put out. I feel that each spouse has a role in there family. If my husband were to make enough money that I could stay home, I would. I would then have no problem doing all of the cooking, cleaning, pleasuring. Reality however, is different. In the real world of today, many families have both spouses working. When this is the case, the husband and wife should share the house hold responsibilities.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I strongly feel that if life is so rough for Brady, then maybe she should start looking for a new husband just as their friend is looking for a new wife.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      “Fighting Back” is an essay that is very compelling to think about. Naturally, one may think or feel the same way Morris did in the essay and wonder why Wormley did not fight back. Fighting back for so many is just an instinct that is done before thought has a chance to take place. Wormley however was raised to think before he acted. I really liked this essay for pointing out that fighting back may not always be the best answer. Sometimes thinking your way through a situation may lead you to a better result and feeling about yourself.

      Jennifer Parkhurst  One Page Paper  Julie Lundblad  July 20, 2004  Reaction to The Right To Die  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Norman Cousins, in his essay The Right To Die, talks about a married couple at the end of their life. They felt if they weren’t able to take care of themselves they why take you the space. They didn’t want their lives prolonged. It was their rights if they wanted to live. In the essay the man said, “We are not afraid to die….” This was their right to live.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The essay was a narrative essay because someone else is telling the store of Van Dusen. It used repetition to reinforce the point of the essay. They didn’t like the fact of taking up space when other people need help. In religion, the human mind finds a larger dimension and is relieved of the ordeal of a confrontation with non-existence. Death is not the greatest loss in life. These are some of the examples from the essay. The tone of the essay was sad.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like the essay because it is true. People should have the right to choose if they want to live or not. The last paragraph in the essay; death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live. The unbearable tragedy is to live without dignity or sensitivity. It makes a good point that people who go into nursing homes loss their dignity. That is why they give up and the greatest loss dies inside them. This essay made me think a lot of what the elderly think. It also gave me ideas of how to write more essays.

      I really liked how William Zinsser started out his introduction in comparison to something most everyone can relate to. Clutter is like fighting weeds, a person has to weed out the ones that don't fit or look good.  &nbsp; I really liked how in his essay he gave numerous examples. It didn't really keep my attention the whole time; in the beginning I was really interested, but towards the end I lost that intrest. I think he was throwing a lot of information into this essay, it was almost overwhelming how he jumped around so much. But all together it was a pretty good essay that pointed out different aspects of cluttering.

      I think E.B White used a great deal of imagery and emotion when writing this story on part in particular caught my eye. “They stayed indoors, kept warm, and ate well, and when there was nothing better to do, they played crokinole. The winter would have passed quietly enough had not someone on the mainland remembered that the Pruitts were out there in the frozen bay.” Mr. White gave me as a reader an essay of great contrast and details to make me feel the Dwelling of this family falling apart.

      I think Norman is talking from his point of view on suicide and how much of it is none sense to the common folk and that we as humans must see all sides of it before judging one on his our her actions. I think there is one great part to this essay that describes this very well. “Even without respect to religion, the idea of suicide has been abhorrent throughout history. Some societies have imposed severe penalties on the families of suicides in the hope that the individual who sees no reason to continue his existence may be deterred by stigma his self-destruction would inflict on loved ones.” I feel this is the point that he wanted to get across.

      Jennifer Parkhurst  One Page Paper  Julie Lundblad  July 19, 2004  Reaction to The Family Which Dwelt Apart  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E.B. White wrote an essay called The Family Which Dwelt Apart, it was about a family that lived on a island far from people. They would go off the island when they needed something from the town. One winter they were stuck on this island because of the bad whether. Someone in town heard that one of the kids of the Pruitt had appendicitis and sent people to help them. Some of the people died and they tried to help the boy but he ended up dying anyway. The house burned to the ground and the last boy found a town to live in.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tone of the story was up bet. The story showed the start with the best place and time to put the reader in the right mindset to absorb details when it starts on an island and the boy appendicitis ruptured. It showed a family on a small island living the way they wanted to live. Then the storm broke out and they were trapped on the island with no resource. Finally the boy died and the brother moved away.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like this essay because it showed a happy beginning and a sad ending. I liked the part where the whole town tried to help them off the island. It showed how people help each other.

      &nbsp;In the begining of the essay wrote&nbsp;by author William Zinsser he discusses how fighting clutter is like fighting weeds and how new varities are always sprouting up over night. When I first read this story I thought that he was talking about the clutter that we have in our lives through material possesions. But as I read on I soon came to realize that he meant through one's writing and how as a society we have learned to not be able to cut to the chase. Throughout this essay he states that we should simplifly&nbsp;our lives by looking at our writing and changing it. I know that this might seem hard but it can be done so says the author&nbsp;of Clutter. So Simplify, sinplify and your life will be better. &nbsp;

      The essay "Women in the wild blue younder" discusses the right for women to do anything that they want to exspecially fly in combat. I don't see why women should not be allowed to do this because like the author states they could get hurt in any other job that they do. One point in this story that puzzles me is the question Can a nurturer also be a destroyer? But when you look at the issue women have been involved in the war forces for many years. Yes as many different parts and yes never as combat flyers. But we have still played an active role in the one thing that keeps are country safe and I think that is very important.

      I grew up in a Christian home that suicide is against God and we will not be able to go to heaven. I can sympathize with Dr. Van Dunsen and his wife in taking their lives. I would want to take my life if I had a serious illness that I couldn't handle. I agree that I would feel like I was taking up a space in the world, too.  I don't see it that way when an elderly gets sick, I'm one of those that would like to take care of them. I would be there for them when they want to talk.

      This was a crazy story, one that as I was reading didn't expect to end the way it did. The writer wrote in a tone that was relaxed and calm; I assumed by the title that they just all went their seperate ways in life. It was written in more of a story than an essay. &nbsp; &nbsp;Instead of crazy I should actually say it was more Ironic. The people that came to help them out and save them, actually end up killing them, another thing I didn't expect. Everything happened so suddenly, I had to read it twice to see if what happened actually happened. Right away I didn't know what to think, I had some mixed emotions and thoughts. All around it was an okay essay.

      I found the title, "The family which Dwelt Apart" fit the essay perfectly.&nbsp; Seven on an island that end up stranded with mentioning of appendicitus set off huge problems with state troopers sending a rescue squad and three lost their lives.&nbsp; I found this essay to be confusing.&nbsp; I had to read it&nbsp;twice.&nbsp; I did like it.&nbsp; After figuring out E.B. White uses a tell-tale,this helped put these images in my mind and I find this can't be possible for all this to happen.&nbsp; The pruitts died from drinking carbolic acid that was left behind by the surgeon whic Pa Pruitt had mistaken for alcohol.&nbsp; The oldest boy charles returns giving his family decent burial and returns to the mainland. I find E.B. white uses imagination in the essay and as I am reading this,&nbsp; I find my emotions going in all sorts of directions.&nbsp; One minute, I'm shocked and another I am chuckling because of the detailed work with so many bizarre incidents.&nbsp; The reader is keeping my attention in the story with different events going on. I found the essay powerful, sad, and hilarious.&nbsp; A Hard-to-Believe Story.

      I must admit that even after reading this story a number of times, I am&nbsp;still confused. Did the author want us to be&nbsp; confused? Was this story written for the humor?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The author certainly demonstrated how one misunderstanding can lead to another misunderstanding and so on. What confused me the most was, who ever led anyone to believe that anyone had appendicitis? The author mentioned&nbsp; it at the beginning of the story for what seemed like a random statement and before you knew it, the whole thing got blown out of proportion.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I like the authors statement, "The winter would have passed quietly enough had not someone on the mainland remembered that the Pruitts were out there in the frozen bay." This statement kind of summed up the whole story. The Pruitts were very happy and content until someone assumed that they were not. I found the setting of a "remote island" to very appropriate for the story. The Pruitts found the isolation they desired, but by doing so, they actually made more problems for themselves. The lack of contact with society created more chaos than had they checked in on a regular basis and not let people wonder what was happening.

      This story reminds me of my Grandmother. She too was an artist that was not allowed to follow her passion because she was a female.  &nbsp;  At first I thought that this story was actually being written by Mary Cassatt because of the great detail given by the author throughout the story. I realized&nbsp;towards the end that it was actually written by her niece.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;The author did such a nice job describing and creating a mental image of Mary Cassatt from her desire to be an artist to the sacrifices she made in order to fulfill her dream. I like the statement the author used, "She typifies one kind of independent American spinster who keeps reappearing in our history in forms as various as Margaret Fuller and Katharine Hepburn." The author demonstrated a deep understanding of these woman, from their love life to their old age. Thank goodness there were woman, and still are, that dare to go against what society "believes" they woman should do.  &nbsp;  I found it ironic and sad that Mary Casatt lost her eye site in her old age. Her art was the focus of her whole life and then to not be able to see. . . .&nbsp; Her life was truly a lonsome life but she felt she had accomplished her goal.

       I found this essay ironic in that I recently went to a garage sale at a storage facility.&nbsp; They were holding a sale for items that were in storage.&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner stopped paying their storage fees, moved, or the item were repossessed for inability to pay rent.&nbsp; I came across a picture of an older lady.&nbsp; From the looks of the frame and the clothes that the lady wore, it was from the seventies.&nbsp; I wondered too if she had had family or had passed away and this was what was left of her.&nbsp; I felt saddened at the thought of this picture sitting up against the table, on the floor, dirty.&nbsp; Where were her daughters and sons?&nbsp; Why would they let a picture of her mother lay there like that?  &nbsp;  When Julie mentions “If they had family – that’s the one that sticks in my throat- if they had family, could they be this forgotten, this neglected”, this saddened me.&nbsp; I am from a close family and this made me think that I am fortunate and blessed.  &nbsp;  The last paragraph brings to my mind how we sometimes will judge others, come to conclusions, and stereotype or assume things before we know and see the whole  picture .

      This essay…my, where to start. My opinion is the same after reading this essay as it was before. I think it was masterfully written and if I wasn’t already so strongly decided on this issue, I most likely would have tilted towards Cousin’s viewpoint. I am 100 percent against assisted suicide. I believe it is completely and totally not up to us to decide when our lives should be over. I think it is up to God, who has an infinitely vaster and greater perspective on what is going on in this nutty world. *Blushes and steps off her soapbox.*  I can recognize how people would disagree with me and this essay certainly points them out. Mentioning a prominent couple who chose to murder themselves, the author brought us to the reality that it’s an issue we all have to face.  Again, had I not been clearly decided on suicide, I might have been swayed by the author’s persuasive and almost inescapable examples. I cannot and will not agree with him though.

      It was rather thought provoking. I was expecting an essay on packrats, even when I had already skimmed it. It was sort of hard for me because I love big words and meshing them together. I do get sick of all the pre-canned phrases and conversation starters though. In this essay the author certainly gave a lot of examples. Almost too many in my opinion. Each one made sense and opened my eyes more to the growing clutter in our language, but I almost got sick of this essay. Just my opinion. It's one of those essays I'm not sure if I like or not. I just read it, so give me a moment.... I can see his point. In some ways we're losing ourselves in all the expected phrases and socially acceptable conversations.  I thought it was funny how this author certainly wasn't shy with "big" words and long sentences. It was almost...cluttered.

       This story reaffirms the teaching in class Wednesday night. It helped me to rethink and restructure my writing while strengthening my resolve to do it better. William Zinsser shows clear examples of how many adjectives are unnecessary in our writing. I don’t know if I’ll be able to change my speech habits, but there is something I can do with my writing. Writing for retail sales you are taught to be very descriptive. This may be how some of these extraneous words were introduced into our language.

       I found this a difficult story to read, but would like to comment on it.    &nbsp;  If you're not aware what time period Mary Cassatt lived in, quotes from the first paragraph help you to define the period. "I would rather see you dead", her father said of her decision to become a painter. Even painter Degas said, "I am not willing to admit that a woman can draw that well".    &nbsp;  The author continues she talks about the "paradoxes of the woman artist",&nbsp;what Mary would have to overcome and the things she had going for her.&nbsp;The time period is mentioned when Mary's mother dies and you understand even more the issues that Mary faced. Even after 28 years abroad as a "renowned Impressionist painter" a Philadelphia newspaper said, "She has been studying painting in France and owns the smalles Pekingese dog in the world."    &nbsp;  They down played her renown, nothing was mentioned about all the famous painters who esteemed their female colleague.

      The author, William Zinsser describes his essay, "CLUTTER"&nbsp;deeply.&nbsp; One example, "at this point in time"&nbsp;is simplified with the word "now".&nbsp; To examine every word on paper is hard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He states "her personal physician" to be "her doctor."&nbsp;&nbsp;Zinsser mentions&nbsp;clutter being the enemy in any form.&nbsp; He mentions&nbsp;starting out clutter is like fighting weeds.&nbsp; This will smother what you write.&nbsp; He quotes many examples&nbsp;like invasion a "reinforced protective reaction strike."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quote, "This will interest you"? is more likely to&nbsp;distract the readers attention finding it dull.&nbsp; The writer is speaking of unnecessary words and ends with the last sentance, "Simplify, simplify." Zinsser uses repitition throughout his essay.&nbsp; One example is, "It's raining."&nbsp; The weatherman&nbsp;says, "At the present time we are experiencing precipition.&nbsp; This is unnecessary jargon.&nbsp; His essay points this out clearly with his many examples. I found this essay hilarious.&nbsp; I liked how he stated his examples from long sentances to one word.&nbsp; I enjoyed the words we eliminated last week.&nbsp; His last sentance I found to be powerful with the word simplify.&nbsp; He used one word instead of saying, "Cut your Clutter."

      I found this essay very interesting? I now know that I am not he only one that looks at old photograghs and wonders why they are not on a family members wall. They must be someones great-grandparents or relative.  The questions that the author asked "who it was that sold a family treasure...?", ".... a relative who can not name the face or family?" were very intriguing and brought even more questions to my mind.  Ithink of my grandmother who has pictures from a hundred years past of her great-grandpartents and those of my grandfather as well when I read this essay. To her the pictures mean so much. Every time that we are together, she has a new picture that she has found or figured out just how they are related to her children and their children. However, I feel callous at times when I am not that interested because I can tie no personal memories or attachments to these people.

      This essay was hillarious and sarcastic. I loved the say that he pointed out the multiple extra fluff words and expressions that we use in our english language everyday and we are now accustom to hearing. We don't even think twice when the weather man states, "At the present time we are experiencing precipitation." That is just the way they talk and we take their language as a part of them. Never have I heard a professional weather man state, "It's raining" and leave it at that. Is the jargon really what makes these people professionals in so many peoples minds?

      Jennifer Parkhurst One Page Paper Julie Lundblad July 14, 2004 Reaction to Picnics and Milk 	Stacy Jurgens, her paper Picnics and Milk, was a story of a little girl and her family. It starts on her grandparent’s farm where her family lives out in a trailer. Both of the little girls would go out and get milk for super everyday. She then describes her father and all the hard work he does for his family. The mother and father cared for each other. At the end they had a picnic and her parents were deeply in love. 	The essay I thought was an illustration essay it gives ideas and pictures of the story. For example, we would have supper on the table and large cool glass of milk setting at each place. The little girls would get the milk from the barn and her father coming to help them with the milk to the house. She also gave realistic images of her parents in the long grass kissing.  	I like to essay. It had a lot of feeling and illustration. It showed that you can use a memory of your past and describe it. I thought was a great writer. What I like the most form this essay is the last paragraph, these memories from my childhood embody everything that I want for my children someday. It shows her feelings for her parents and that she too wants to be a good parent for her children.

      Before I had read this piece, my view of suicide was that it was wrong, a selfish act, against what the Catholic Church believes, and an easy way out of a difficult situation.  After I read this my views are open a little more to the thought that there are other logical, ethical, and moral issues out there other than my closed views.  Some thoughts that I found in the essay that were of interest to me were, "They didn't like the idea of taking up space in a world with too many mouths and too little food.", "They believed it was a misuse of medical science to keep them technically alive., "what they were turning against was the notion that there were no circumstances under which life should be discontinued.", and "life can beprolonged by science far beyond meaning or sensibility."  The one sentence that made me really stop to think about suicide is "The general reaction to suicide is bound to change as people come to understand that it may be a denial, not an assertion, of moral or religious ethics to allow life to be extended without regard to decency or pride."  This also lends me to think that what other denials in our life to we hold onto and attach a moral or religious ethic or excuse onto so that we don't have to face the truth?

           I really enjoyed this essay.  Even though I did not grow up on a farm, Stacy's description of her childhood easily crosses over to mine.  It brought images of my grandparents and picnics with my family to mind.  It also brought back images of my sister and I and the little sneaky things we used to try to get away with.  Especially when she says "stolen sips of whole milk" and "standing there with my sisters peeking at my kissing parents through the long grass.      I like the last paragraph in that she talks about how she wants for her children what she had growing up.  I think that we all want more for our children.  In wanting that for them, we sometimes forget to also instill hard work and determination and to not forget the simple things are sometimes the best in life.

      In Limited seating on Broadway, THe author John Hockenberry refers to the mistreatment of those with dissabilities. When he mentioned about the theater and how they did not take ticket orders over the phone for people with dissabilities. I think that the writer of this essay made it plain right there that the theater discriminated against disabled persons.The MAnager comes out wavimg a copy of a policy for disabled patrons like it was the bible. AFter humiliatin the author he then proceeds to show him to the door or the floor in his case.           Hockenberry uses this story to not only share how it felt to be a person with dassabilities, but also to show a side of people that is usually not ever shown to anyone.A persons fear can prevent someone from getting to know those that are different.THe author used very discriptive words in describing how he was treated.          Discrimination of people with special needs is not only moraly wrong but it is also a crime that many people commit on an every day basis and dont even know it. When people can accept everyone they will not have all of the problems that they would normally have.

      I think that the author John HockenBerry describes just how it feels for a person with any type of disability. I thought this idea was carried very well through out the essay. Some examples of this harsh treatment includes how the manager of the theater was unwilling to help him enjoy the theatoical proformace. How he had to carry a bottle of urine fourty blocks because there was not a suitable restroom for him to use. I really found it instresting on how he tells us about the proposal for handicapped accessible public restrooms on public streets and how the city opposed puting them in because the Public Art Commission had stated that the structure were just too ugly. No one should have to feel insucure just because they have a disability. They should have the same rights as everyone else. No matter what your race, age, or type od disability you have.

      In this story I feel the author used very good imagery. Right from the begining he gave me this feeling. He opeing sentance was using great emotion and imagery and I feel there is not to many other words of choice to tell you how well he does throughout the essay with using in great depth what it was like in the prison on a exceution day. A good example of the author's imagery start like this " Two of them stood by with rifles and fixed bayonets, while the others handcuffed him, passed a chain through his handcuffs and fixed it to their belts, and lashed his arms tight to his sides." To me this gives me great imagination what the prisoner was going through and what the guards were doing.

      When John Hockenberry speaks about the art community in New York City, you would never guess where this story was leading and I like that.  In the second paragraph he speaks of them as having, "a reputation for being progressive."  He then goes on to say, "the theater world likes to think of itself as a seeker of such challenges and is proudest when a play or musical becomes a vehicle for change."  It doesn't look like they were being much of a "vehicle for change" as the manager told him he'd have to leave.  It seems that all the people in the arts community couldn't have cared less since no one dared to step forward to help him or defend his right to be there.  I noticed the reinforced authority of the manager as he was holding the copy of "Policy for Disabled Patrons".  The irony of this story is spelled out in the author's last sentence, "Art and theater are nothing if not honest."

      I was not excepting to read about a guy that was in a wheelchair. I feel his anger about the house manager coming over with a policy for disabled patrons, they should of told him that when he bought the tickets. I don't think that its right to not have a theater accessible to any one.

      I found it interesting how the story about the authors love for her garden evolved into a story about her nephews, and how her garden helped her work out the problems she was having with them. I love how she refers to her garden as a friend. I can relate to this. She talks about how she finds solace in working the soil and how pulling weeds relaxes her. When something is troubling her she goes to her garden to work out her problems.  She talks about her difficulty having children and her disapproval of her brother and sister-in-laws divorce. She talks about how the divorce has affected her nephews from "her perspective." For example,the author feels, "They have been forced prematurely into adulthood and hide the scars of their pain under layers of affected indifference." Is this indeed the case? Are not all 15 year olds indifferent to the world other then themselves? Could it be that because she has not raised children yet herself, that she can not understand this. She also states, "I have learned to force thoughts of the two of them wandering the streets with their other "latch-key" friends from my mind." Are they truly wandering or is she a little jealous because she might think, had these been the children she could not have, she would have done something differently. It is very easy to judge others until we have actually been put in the same situation.   I feel the author raises some very valid points but I am also glad that she realizes that these are not her children to raise and she has done the right thing by, "praying that the seeds of love she has sown will flourish." She can not protect them by building a fence around them as she stated. Her garden, and friend, has helped her to realize this.

      I found this essay to be very thought provoking. The author was writing this story from first hand experience. I found it interesting how at first, the author referred to the prisoner as "a puny wisp of a man, with a shaven head and vague liquid eyes." It was if the author had to somehow justifying they were doing, by finding some negative qualities in the prisoner. The author never did state what the prisoners crime had been.   As the Essay unfolded, the author began to realize that not only was this a prisoner, but he was also a human being with feelings, just like his own. For example, when the author stated,"Once, in spite of the men who gripped him by each shoulder, he stepped lightly aside to avoid a puddle on the path. It is curious; but till that moment I had never realized what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man. When I saw the prisoner step aside to avoid the puddle, I saw the mystery, the unspeakable wrongness, of cutting a life short when it is in full tide."  It seemed that all of the people involved in the hanging had become desensitized to what they were doing. I think that the dog that showed up threw them all off guard because the dog was so innocent and unaware of what was going on. I think the dog symbolized the reality of what they were actually doing.  Even the superintendent, also the doctor, had a hard time declaring the man "dead". He only said, "He's all right." I assumed he could not say the word dead because then he would have to take some responsibility for his death.   I think this essay was about the author realizing that these prisoners were human beings, just like himself and what they were doing was not acceptable. He also found himself questioning how quickly life returned to normal as they got further away from where the hanging had taken place.

      I thought this was a wonderful story. You could tell that the author wrote this with thoughts of love, happiness and a great feeling of security.   Throughout the story, the author used many examples describing the love she felt from her family. For example, "We saw no problem with our parents sneaking some afternoon loving into their busy days. There's a good feeling you get, even at the age of five, when you see your parents madly in love with each other." She also talked about the teasing that went on amongst the family members. I think this teasing suggests that she was very secure in their love.   I think the most significant statement the author made was at the end of the story. She stated, "These memories from my childhood embody everything that I want for my children someday. I want them to appreciate what they have and work for what they get, just as my sister and I did with the milk." I think this statement speaks for itself because, why would you want to raise your own children as you had been raised if it wasn't a wonderful experience?

          In george Orwell's short essay "A Hanging" He starts his story in Burma. There is a hindu man condemed to death. I found it interseting how first of all the Hindu Man's crime was never menntioned. I think that made one to wonder if a crime had even been committed. As the writer uses extreamly descriptive words he leads us with him on that fatefull morning that a hanging occured. WE are able to follow the superintendants every step of the way to the final hanging. I do wonder what signnificance the stray dog had to the man and the story. I think that the writer was trying to make a connection to animals and humans in pain.

      I thought it was very moving. I feel her pain that she has about how the parents handled the divorce and how they are acting after the divorce. We want to help kids that are struggling because of family situations. I feel her pain that she has to set back and let the parents be, sometime all we can do is just be there for them when they need somoene to just talk, too.  I liked how Deb Sullivan called her garden her friend and how she compared the twin nephews and the garden on how they were the same. Like when she was saying that she planted them in her world, build a fence around them to keep them safe, and how she has "weed out" their negatives out of their lives. You can very clearly see how much she lovs Jake and Ben.

      When I finished reading this essay,  I think the whole story relates to how John Hockenberry talks of places such as the Virginia Theatre and public restrooms and how those in wheelchairs or others who are handicapped are treated unfairly. Why not put in a ramp at the theatre?  This is a question I thought of when reading this. The part with the bottle of urine I found to be unusual.  I also find I think the reason for this is because the public restrooms make no room and doesn't seem like they try to hard to accomplish a restroom for people who are handicapped, in wheelchairs or otherwise. The author grabs me from the getgo.  The high price of pay for handicapped people in wheelchairs, the usher being very rude.  This really was getting me upset and angry.  I can just imagine how he must of felt. I think people in wheelchairs are still human and need even more respect because, to no fault of their own, noone asks to be in a wheelchair or otherwise.  If possible, people need to be kind and generous and treat them with utter respect.  Can you tell. This story got my blood boiling because of the way in him being unfairly from my point of view. The part of the two attendants throwing him out of his wheelchair really is out of  proportion.  It isn't right that he was going to dump his urine here.  He could have went home but maybe he needed to so he could use it again. All in all, the story just got me upset with the handicapped being treated unfairly, in every respect.

           I can relate to this story.  I like the part how Deb Sullivan refer to her Garden as a friend.  I think this is  because she sees it as her place of sanity and finds peace and feels free being in her garden.      The story continues with her raking up leaves and then talk of thinking of nurture of animals, humans, and plants in her garden.  She goes into detail of how people tell her that her husand and herself would make great parents and then how they can't have children.  They have thought of adoption but that gets nowhere and the years continue to slip away.      Deb Sullivan then has a focus of her nephews, Ben and Jake.  They are fifteen years old and identical twins.  She loved them from the start with a deep passion.  Probably because this is where she felt closest to someone when not being able to have any children of her own.  They created good memories going camping, boating, and more.      Tragedy strikes with the parents of these boys getting divorced and everything changes.  From Deb Sullivans' point, these boys now have a shattered life.  They have been forced prematurely into adulthood.  She finds she has tears on her face from a cool breeze drifting by and wipes her face.     Her attention turns back to the garden when she wipes dirt from her face from the tears.  She talks of planting Jake and Ben in her Garden wanting nothing more than to keep them safe and nurture them tenderly and to keep them safe from the harsh elements of life.     She realizes she has helped these boys by spending time with them and so refers to it as planting a seed in their lives.  She will continue to pray for them and in hope that the seeds of love she has sown will flourish in their lives.  She has helped to weed out the negatives in their life and also has helped them to make right choices.  She now stands back to watch them grow and turns to her garden, to her peaceful and quite place that gives her comfort where she can be free from the worries of life.     This was a great story and in my own life, with being divorced with two girls, I watched the pain on their face also.  In the end, it now worked out better all the way around.  I never say anything bad of their dad and I tell them it is not their fault.  They are enjoying time with him now.  I know they love me also and I do feel he does the same.  Letting them know I love them and it is not their fault.  I spent time in my own garden when I was married so this story is great.  I wouldn't change any of it.  I think she did the perfect job writing this essay and she just kept grabbing my attention with everything that I've written.  She makes great points of her garden and the divorce.

      This essay caught my attention with the title, but that is about where it ended for me. I found it a little hard to follow and the point escaped me in the beginning. And why was he carrying a bottle of urine? He never did explain that. Or maybe I’m just missing it. ?? 	I did feel sympathetic towards him when he mentioned the ill treatment that he received just because of his disability. I wanted to smack the house manager that kicked him out so rudely.  	But all in all I wasn’t that thrilled with this story. Aside from feeling a little indignant with the author, I wasn’t left with much of an impression with this essay.

      This writer came off to me as being very judgemental and negative, but I realize after reading it a couple of times she was basically stating her thoughts and observations as to how people act. I do agree, everyone does show off in some way or another, but this doesn't make them a bad person at all, it's just how we are, we all just want to be noticed in some way. I like how she states the different kinds of show offs and give examples of them, it creates images for the reader.

      I really liked this essay; it kind of gives the reader a easy-happy feeling. Growing up she was a happy little girl that enjoyed how she lived; it wasn't because of money either, it was because her family worked together and supported eachother, she worked for the things she got, and it was a feeling of accomplishment to her. After reading this essay it didn't make me wish I had more, it made me wish that I had what she did. I have lots of respect for people who work for what they get.

      Chief Seattle uses one major tone though out the essay that he writes on the white man vs. the red man or another term that he uses is his people. The tone that I am refering to is that of a very deep intensived process that his people go through with the white people. Chief Seattle uses many examples of this treatment through out his writing of this essay but the one example of this use of tone that sticks out to me in his writing is "The white man's God cannot love our people or He would protect them." To me this is his way of getting back at the white man for all that we have done to his people. To me it is not the current peoples fault of what are ansestor did or didn't do to the red man or in the case of Chief Seattle his people. It is not like he owns them. In that way he is telling them what to do instead of letting them make up there own oppions on the white man and how we treat them. The major techique that he uses through out this essay is the way that he words things so that when you read it the reader gets the sense that the blame is on the white people if he is of a different background and this inside of it's self can cause problems if you go back in to history. If the reader is of white hertige this essay can make them feel like everything that they have no control on is all there fault when in reality they may have nothing but their heritige to do with it.

      I feel the tone to the "What Me? Showing Off?" essay is obnoxious in most parts and the only humor I found is where she talked of herself showing off with her poems being published and she wanted everyone to know it. The technique I find Viorst using is a lot to do with repetition. There are many examples throughout the essay that explains this. For example, showing off is mentioned throughout the whole essay. Viorst talks also about the different categories of showoffs, which are the competive showoffs as well as the Narcissitic and sympathetic type showoffs. She uses the word exhulting numerous times such as, "Exhulting is what my husband does when he cooks me one of his cheese-and-scallion omelets and pratically does a tap dance as he carries it from the kitchen stove to the table, setting it before me with the purely objective assessment that this may be the greatest omelet ever created." I feel the repition is distracting.

      Mealtimes in my family have been a time when I usually cooked, I was raised by my mother and grew up as a single child. Many times, (especially in the summer) it was my job to cook dinner because my mother would work. We would have to have everything done in time for me to get to hockey practice.I found our meals to be very rushed, if I was to have any dinner around 5:00p.m. or 6:00p.m. at all. Alot of times I would have to wait until after hockey practice to have dinner, and then we usually picked up something from a fast food place.

      Thoughts on “We May Be Brothers”  This essay brought me to two different spots. At the beginning the author led me to believe that he was only pointing out the differences between the two peoples and their ways of life. I was not excited to read on at that point. After continuing to read, I really got sucked in by the way of thinking that this man had about the differences in the two peoples. I really like how it ended by expressing how the two peoples differ in their view of death and how he, the author, believes that his people will always be around even if they are dead. His writing gave me a very ominous feeling.

      Stacy as writer comes out to me as a very loving and appreciative of her past. She tells this essay from a single point of view. She tells us of her past through child like eyes but through an adult voice. She gave these examples through a paragraph like this: “Most nights my dad could finish the milking and catch up to us before we made it past the garden and carry the jug for us, teasing us all the way. By the time we got to the trailer and Dad had washed up, we would have supper on the table and a large, cool glass of milk setting at each place.”

      Collectively our group felt that Chief Seattle spoke in a reserved tone.  Reading his words you see the contrast between Chief Seattle's people, "My people are few" and the Big Chief at Washington's people, "His people are many".  These are statements, facts without emotion, passive.  He uses powerful imagery throughout like, "day and night cannot dwell together".  Even though the title is "We May Be Brothers", by his question "how then can we be brothers?" and all the other differences, I wonder if he was saying here that it would be impossible.

      This essay is about just that clutter. Each day we deal with clutter. Our children, our jobs, our belongings, cars, every day I deal with this clutter. I love how he used clutter in different manners, such as a laborious phrase, language, ponderous euphemism, each time using it to the best of his ability.

      Thoughts on “What, Me? Showing Off?”  This essay drips with truth. The writer uses a sarcastic honest tone in writing this essay. She displays her sarcastic tone and honesty in describing how she herself shows off. “And then there was us, complaining about how tired we are today because we went to work, rushed back to see our son’s school play, shopped at the market and hurried home in order to cook gourmet, and then needlepointed another dining-room chair. And what we are doing is showing off”.  Viorst is also uses humor in her writing. She displays this by titling the different categories of showoffs as competitive showoffs (CSO), narcissistic showoffs (NSO), and insecure showoffs (ISO).  I think that we all know at least one person who could fit in one or more of these categories. More importantly, it makes me wonder which one I would fit into.

      Stacy Jurgens the author of Picnics and milk used a delightful tone throughout her essay. Making sure that the mood is light and carefree coming from a child's eyes is a perfect setting I think. The technique she uses is memories of childhood. And I mean this as she allows you to see this essay through the memories of one child's childhood. A perfect example of this specific technique is this.......  Lunchtime was different then suppertime in that my father did not come back to the house to eat. Instead, he either took a lunch with him or (my favorite) (in other words this was a childhood memory of hers that she can remember) we took a picnic lunch to him. We never knew when these picnics would occur, but sometimes Mom would pull out the old wicker picnic basket and send us girls to the garden for fresh tomatoes and cucumbers. We knew then that we were going to find Dad in the fields.  This was to me what seems to be a perfect memory for a child to recollect when they see a picnic basket, or tomotoes and cucumbers. I for one know this for sure I have had a lot of childhood memories and this girl sure knows what a memory can mean by the looks of particular objects or places.

      Many years ago I had a girlfriend that was the love of my life. I thought that we would always be together no matter what. This girlfriend and I had a relationship for five years and we were very committed to one another.  Eventually, I ended up taking a job in St. Paul and because of this I was forced to move. Our relationship continued for many months after, but it was very hard. We only got to see each other on the weekends so we always made the most of it. We would go shopping and out to eat all the time. On many of these ocassions I purchased things  for my new apartment. I still have many of them to this day.  One such purchase was a hollowed out clay cowboy boot, my girlfriend helped me find the right fake flower arrangement to put inside. I still think of her everytime I look at it. I can still picture her arranging the flowers.

      I feel that capital punishment is a way of families seeking revenge on an assailant. I feel this way because of my christian beliefs. It says in the Ten Commandments that to kill is a sin, and that this sin is punishable by eternal damnation in hell. I do believe this, but I also believe that families do deserve some redemption.  I would have to say that killing someone, for their satisfaction is wrong no matter who pushes the switch. I would sooner have a criminal that deserve such a sentence be left to rot in a labor prision. Atleast this way society could profit from their work and they would have no hope of ever getting out.

      The human race can be so cruel. People are criticised and rejected because they may be different or not normal. When you see a person that may have special needs, or maybe they talk differently, we tend to tune them out and not acnowlege them. I see people all the time doing this because i work with a child that has mental dissabilities. THis child also has a hard time in social experiences. When she meets new people she tends to latch on to them and thinks that everyone is her best friend. SHe doesn't see the looks that some people make at her. I hope that never changes. She doesn't need to see them at her age. she does not know how to discriminate. She will play with those older than her and those younger than her. I wish that no one could make someone feel differently. We are all the same and we are all different. WHat makes the difference is how we treat others and how we treat our selves. When a person cannot respect their own self then there is no way that they can care about or even respect another person. When i was about 13 years old, I was teased and ridiculed. I always was the but of anyones jokes, and was not really liked be anyone. I had a very good friend though that has kept me from continuing this disrespect. They taught me that the people that had made fun of me jsut felt insecure about themselves so they teased me to make themselves feel better. I hopethat someday this child that i take care of can see that it is not right to make fun of someone else jsut because they are unhappy with their lives. I hope that maybe people will be able to see her for the sweet, caring, and talented young lady that she is becoming and not discriminater against her. John Hockenberry's Essay "Limited Seating on Broadway" stated it best. " It is the forum and agent for chalenging America's hardend perceptions about race, politics, class, gender, religion and more recently AIDS and homophobia." All of these people are are all different from us but they are also the same. We need to remember that.

      The author, Deb Sullivan in her essay, IN THE GARDEN, quotes, "I realize I want to do for Jake and Ben as I do for the plants in my garden. I want to plant them in my world and tenderly care for them, helping them to grow healthy and strong. I want to build a fence around them and protect them from the harsh elements of life." Having three children of my own, I understand how Deb Sullivan wants to protect her twin nephews. This is what I want for my children, to protect them. Deb Sullivan quotes, "Their parents, my brother and his wife of fourteen years, divorced. Certainly not a new phenomenon, but I had no idea the change and tremendous pain that divorce can bring." Myself, having been married ten years with two beautiful girls found I had not prepared for this terrible feeling of being depressed. I fell into a deep slump and could not understand how my soon-to-be exhusband did not even put up a fight for these two children. Little did I know there was someone else involved or I was in denial with him being involved with someone twelve years younger than him. I was divorced within two months! Talk about a fast divorce. I wrapped alot of myself worth in my husband so my depression was deep, to the point of suicidal thoughts. I had an onion on the counter when the girls would walk in and see my cry. I would tell them it is the onion making tears in my eyes. This was in my apartment that I moved into that I could not stand living in. I joined a B.E. group. This is Beginning Experience for divorced, widowed and separated. This group helped me tremendously. I had no sense of direction when I got divorced. Where do I go now? What direction is my life heading in? What a Change! I no longer could work due to my depression. I had a hard time socializing and tryed various medications that did not work. I ended up in the hospital for taking Prozac that totally went against me. My thyroid was off and my blood pressure went up. I was seeing snakes and just was not a good thing. I moved out of the apartment and bought a trailer house that made me feel better because I actually got more rest and was able to do part-time work with hallmark cards in the Ben Franklin and Pamida store in Roseau, Mn. Later, I added another part-time job doing jewelry. This was in the fall and I started going to Al-Anon meetings that helped me a lot. After one year, I decided to move back close to my hometown which is Gonvick, Mn. I live four miles from there in a town called, Clearbrook, MN. Little did I know, I would be adding a new member to my family. A little boy, born in May of two-thousand one. What a surprise to my life he was. I love him dearly and he is now three years old. My house is small for the four of us but we manage to make it work for us. I have done a lot of painting and rearranging to make for a cozy home. This is where I feel I am doing something for my family. I am back in school and not isolating myself from society. I am once again trying to venture out into this world to make something of myself, not just for me but for my children. This is where all my hard work lies. Within my kids. They are my reason for life, for living, for being here. At one time in my life, for quite a while I did not know that this is what held me together. They're my pride and joy and I would do anything to give them the world. I do the best to give them what I can and that is the best I can do. Deb Sullivan, in her essay connects this with planting in the garden and relating it to life with nurturing and caring for her garden in the way she does the same for her twin nephews by praying for the seeds of love to flourish in their life. I hope this works for my children too. I pray everynight for God to watch over them and keep them safe, especially when they are not in my care when they go with their Dad's and I have no control but to put them in Gods' tender loving care. I don't like being apart from my children but with divorce, there is no choice. What is going to happen will and I hope that they always come home safe.

      First, I would like you to turn in your first Springboard essay before you leave.  Remember to turn in the second tomorrow.  That will be your final essay.  If I can grade all of your first Springboards before class tomorrow, I will give you time at the end of class to revise your second Springboard.  I would like one more thing from you. I would like you to write about your writing this term. I would like you to look over your essays and note any pattern errors that you have. Pattern errors are those that happen repeatedly, not just once. Then, I would like you to note any kind of problems you have had content-wise. Mostly, though, I would like you to talk about how your writing has evolved over the term. How has your sense of essay changed? What do you do better now? What essays illustrate that change? These are just a few of the questions that you can ask yourself, but if you want to focus on some other aspect of writing, do so.  This will be a sort of last prompt to bring together what we have done.   Type it in word and bring it to class tomorrow night, our final class.  Then choose your best essay to read to the class tomorrow night.  This will be our "Final" celebration.

      When I married my husband, I knew that both he and his father were trappers, hunters and fisherman. I was never exposed to these activities as a child because I was raised as a “city kid”. The fishing I have come to enjoy and I can deal with the hunting as long as I don’t have to carry a gun, but the trapping is another story. I can certainly relate with the author of “The Coon Hunt” as she described how she felt when she was expected to kill something for the first time. She stated, “Oh no! I am going to have to kill a raccoon! How am I supposed to tell Dad that I can’t kill anything?” My heart broke for her. Her family was forcing her to except something she did not believe in. I didn’t have to think about hunting, fishing and trapping much until our children started to get old enough to be interested in these activities. I encouraged their love of fishing and when they were old enough, even hunting as long as they hunted with respect for the animals. But somehow, I could never understand why they had to be part of the whole trapping experience. To trap an animal and let it suffer until you return the next day, or even a couple of days later, is deplorable to me. I knew that it was not just my decision, so my husband and I compromised. The kids could accompany him when he was setting traps, but I did not want them to go along when he was actually collecting his catch or skinning or fleshing them in order to be sold. For awhile, this compromise worked nicely until grandpa got involved. One day grandma and grandpa (my husband’s parents), were babysitting our children. When we returned home and pulled into their driveway, I was shocked at what I saw. Grandpa had been out in his “trapping garage” taking care of his catch for the day. He had to skin and flesh the hides of the animals that he had trapped, in order to prepare them to be sold. He decided that our boys could accompany him to watch. I guess one thing led to another and when we pulled in the driveway, they had a beaver’s intestines stretched from one end of the yard to another. Needless to say, I was appalled! Somehow, what they were doing was so disrespectful and disgusting to me. Lives should be cherished even if they are only an animal’s life. When I got out of the car and asked what on earth they were doing? Both of our boys simply replied, “We wanted to see how long they are.” I was speechless. I asked my husband to please get the boys ready to go and I headed into the house to collect their things. Once we returned home, I sat the boys down and explained how I felt about what they were doing and why. They had only been following their grandfather’s lead and were too young to understand that what they were doing was wrong, as far as I was concerned. I explained to them that even though something is dead, we still need to respect their remains. I later discussed my feelings with my father-in-law. He could not understand how I felt, but agreed to make sure that the boys would never partake in something so gruesome again. In exchange, I agreed that when they were older enough, they could make their own decision as to whether they were interested in trapping. I appreciated the respect he showed for my feelings. Interestingly enough, neither one of our boys ever became truly interested in trapping as they grew up. Was it because I felt so strongly about what had happened that day? Was it the compromise my husband and I had reached? Or was it because they too, felt that trapping was an inhumane sport to participate in?

      Bethany Salmonson Composition 1-SBEssay 2 Julie Lundblad August 2004                                                 A World of Words             I walk along the rows of books. My arm reaches out and my hand brushes across the spines. I feel the textured smoothness underneath my fingers and I take in a deep breath. I see the letters, I see the titles, but I don’t concentrate on the words. My mind is content to be numb in the familiar environment. I don’t need to think in this place. I know the path to take and I know the curves and pointed edges. Every turn is dear to me. I smell the musty scent of old books. I pick up a well used book with a brown cover. It is a classic and has been read many times over by many people. Here it lies, one copy of a great masterpiece and it lies now forgotten in storage. I take it home with me. I admire the ripped binding and torn cover. This book almost tells two stories. The one that the author composed and the unwritten story that is lying in its outward appearance. I stop to wonder how many hands have held this book, how many people have opened it’s cover.

      Deborah Tannen once wrote, "When people have arguments in private life, they're not trying to understand what the other person is saying. They're listening for weaknesses in logic to leap on, points they can distort to make the other look bad. We all do this when we're angry." In her essay "The Triumph of the Yell"  I feel this paragraph especially relates to my life. The biggest fights Tim and I had were always over money. One night we were discussing the disbursements of the money and where it needs to go, when I reminded him the importance of dates. This sparked a fude.
