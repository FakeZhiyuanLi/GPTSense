        For Daniel.    I am not trying to fuck you about, and i didnt post this on here for you to read. I posted it because i had to get some things out, and didnt think that you'd end up reading this before i got a chance to talk to you.  Please dont be annoyed with me over this - i do want you to come over. I just dont think us having sex would be such a good idea. If that is what's pissed you off (that right now im not ready to have sex with you) then i suppose i should be the one thats more than a little pissed off.   I honestly love you to bits, and i dont wanna pursue this thing with sumone else - because trying to do the inexclusive thing with two guys would be as silly right now for me (and for you and him) as me trying to do the exclusive thing with you.  I didnt post this for you. I posted it for me, to release some thoughts and tension because right now ive got everything flowing through my brain at 120mph including my feelings on this, information (and worries) about the two worst Highers i have one after the other that im not prepared or confident enough to take, and me having a massive blow-out with my very best friend in the whole world, where i came across as an arse and hurt her feelings very badly.  This isnt about you. This is about me, and the reason i keep repeating the inexclusive thing is to remind myself, not you. Because if i forget that for two seconds my feelings for you will get stronger and stronger (as they are already getting) much faster, and i will end up getting us both into a relationship that i cant commit to and i wont hurt you like that.  I like you way too much to jerk you around like that. But obviously you're having some problems with "us", so if youd care to express them for once instead of everything being bloody hunkey-dorey then that would be a change. Maybe not a happy one, but that way im not the only one being completely honest about how they feel.  Is that not what we're supposed to be with each other? Honest?  You're always bloody happy about everything, and it makes me feel like the fucking badguy in all of this. Which, maybe i am. But how the hell can you feel the way you claim to about me and be okay with half the shit we talk about.  'I love you, but go ahead and toss it around town. I dont mind.'  Meanwhile you have no interest in doing anything with anyone else, and so i end up being the only part of this relationship that is inexclusive, and you're closing yourself off to anything romantically that doesnt involve me. I dont like being the centre of attention, you know.  I love you, but we have to talk. And this time we have to talk without me going back on it two minutes later like happened last time. Im sorry i wrecked your high, but that is why we need to talk. You claim you dont care about me seeing other people, and that i should do it anyway, but talk of this manages to ruin you being happy? That shows that you're not being totally honest with me, and it shows that we are both getting a bit too emotionally dependant on each other for two people not in an exclusive relationship.  I wish it could be more. I really REALLY fucking wish it could be right now. But it cant, because i dont have the time or the patience to manage exams plus you plus a whole Summer away from you. I dont expect you to wait around for me. But i cant wait until the point where i can let myself love you the way i really want to.  For anything in this, or anywhere else, that has offended you or upset you more, then i have nothing to say. Sorry doesnt begin to cover it.

      I am so massively fucked up right now.  Daniel is in Paris as of yesterday for about a week. When he comes back next week he is supposed to be coming down on Thursday (the new rescheduling, due to Maz's visit on Wednesday). I'm not sure what i'm thinking about it. I think i have to talk to him about things (if he doesnt read this before then, in the event of which: "Hey fannybaws!"), because we're not exclusive, and we cant be. I cant get into that just now. Call it bullshit all you like, but i have no time during the summer holidays to maintain a proper relationship, and i dotn have time just now with my exams and shit that i have to deal with (including my mental state and the deal with my blackouts, headaches and coughing up blood).  So it worries me, because we spoke the other day, and although ive wanted to have sex with him for a while now and would've quite willingly done it last week, Wednesday gave me a chance to sit and think about it. Sleeping together would be bad. I'd love it, and no doubt it'd be great. I cant think of anyone else right now id rather lose my virginity to. But im the nearest thing to a boyfriend he's ever had, and we havent even kissed yet, and yet we're getting to a stage of emotional reliability (which is the exact part of a proper relationship that i cant hold up just now). Its not just him, im getting there too. God help me, but i love the guy.  Doing "it" would just be a mistake then, because it does automatically create an emotional bond, wether u decide it will or not. Especially when it's your first time. I cant do that to him; or me. Because that would just get us into a situation that we couldnt get out of easily enough - i cant give him what he wants right now.     Despite low confidence when it comes to my looks, it turns out i'm not quite as damn ugly as i was sure i was. And it's true - it is a curse being this damn sexy :P  Daniel wants me bad, as im sure we've established. But now i am gettting right fucked up.   I had a talk with Greg last night, talking about Daniel, and he says he's disappointed that i cant see him right now, but when i can he hopes i can keep him in mind.  And then there is the one who shall remain nameless as he may read this and not be too happy that i've announced it. This guy and i met a while ago (friend of a friend), and i immediately liked him. We've not seen each other for ages, but the other night he added me to his Messenger contacts, and we've been talking a bit since. When i first met him, he was really cute, great smile, hot hair, good fashion sense but straight. I kept telling myself (and the friend whose friend he is) that deep down he was gay, just for a laugh and secretly hoping he wasnt gay, coz there goes my non-hurtful excuse as to why he would never be interested in me. Then, the other night, he told me he was gay.  See ya non-hurtful excuse!  So we talked and talked. He hasnt been getting anywhere with guys (God only knows why - its one of those cruel mysteries, like "Why are all the good ones gay", "Why are all the good ones straight" and "Why are all the good ones dead"). Anyhoo, we were talking and i was all surprised and stuff, and i was telling him i didnt have the faintest clue why he wasnt getting any, and ended up complimenting him several times. And along the way admitting that i "used to have a huge thing for him" (heehee - that sounds so wrong). Then i backed up, he noticed it was awkward and asked me why. I was all like "i look like a complete buttwipe admitting i liked someone thats never been the slightest bit interested in me". I was very very embarassed.  "Buttwipe", party of one...  That was until he claimed he liked me. Astounding. Utterly utterly gobsmacked, so i was. Hot guy i "used" to like telling me he liked me before.  So the conversation proceeded. He told me bout how he had admired me for my honesty and bravery and "dont give a shit what you think" attitude concerning my sexuality. He said something along the lines of "you were just so cute, and you acted as if you knew it" (i didnt). I really cannot believe this. Its amazing - im not as off-putting as i thought. Go Me! YAY!  When he last met me it was October '03, or thereabouts. I was knackered because of all the extra hours i had to put in for Higher Drama, plus I was a bit shorter and fatter (still on the up from my childhood obesity...okay i admit i had been fit months before, coz of SYT - this was the health lull, where i wasnt doing as much exercise or eating as well as i had during the summer).   So if he liked me then, then i must be lookin good now, non mes companions? (Dont correct my french - i like it the way it is: ballsed up).  I was all like "Its amazing to find out u used to like me" or sumthing along those lines that was much less dorky, and then came the big fucker.  "Used to?"  Bugger! Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger!  BUGGER!!!  Hasnt seen me in ages, but apparently im memorable. Shit.  What the hell am i gonna do?! Obviously im gonna do something. I just dunno wot it is. I might not do anything. I might've claimed last nite that i didnt miss daniel yet, but after that it set in. I need him to talk to. And to slap me in the face with a lil bit of a guilt-trip for even thinking about someone else. Dammit.    BUGGER!!!!!!!!!

       urlLink    Check out the awfulness! Key people include the following: me down the front looking like an arse with that pen;  The girl with the very red nose (due to the bodypaint) and the burgundy tee would be Moira, hugging Grace ("oooh FUCK ME!").  Chris is the larger guy with the blue striped tee, standing next to Maz (yes, MAZ!) with the shorter hair and the mysteriously voluptous bosom.  Behind her is Kyle (or Kylie, as we liked to kno she/he) with the red vest on. Very hot in real life, until the yellow bodypaint and costume he had to wear made him look like a drag queen with Jaundice. A disturbingly HOT drag queen with jaundice.  Behind my lil Mazly Wazly (altho "lil" prob aint the right way to describe that pic of her) is Gareth, whose face u can only see a lil of.  The cluster in the middle involve lil Ashleigh (my female son) just above Gracey, with Erika (stripey sleeves) and Jenni on either side of her (i love Jenni. LOVE Jenni!). Behind them are the lovely Karen and the very red Leanne, and behind them, Steph (who sooo kicks ass) and Ross (my ex). At the far right with big cheesy grin is my little Lucy with "duracell bunny" Lori next to her.  Wow ive bored the hell out of you.  The dude on the far left is Keith, our musical director, and behind Kyle's hair you can just see a wee bit of a woman's face - thats Julie Austin (who is like my totally role-modelest role-model), our director. I love her. She rocks, and we get along scarily well for someone who was in braveheart.   This is us in the Citz Theatre Glasgow (where me, Jenni, Lucy, Leanne, Gareth, Ash and Steph will be appearing again late this July) during SYT last year.  *sigh* good times.    Heehee i cant get over how much of an arse i look there. ARSE-ME!

      I feel like utter pants. I was sitting here earlier, reading my bast entries, and something hit me.  I came across a comment i made concerning my pal Maz, and how she's coming down this Wednesday. I also then came across a part concerning Daniel, and freaked out - im supposed to be getting together with him on Wednesday!   SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!  I dunno wot the hell to do - if i cancel any more dates hes gonna think i dont wanna do them (or him, for that matter) which i totally do!   SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!

      Okay the name might get me in a bit of trouble, coz there might be sumthin in the rules bout offensive language. If thats the case, i'll change it, but it works for now.  I've replied to Maz's letter. Seems no matter what i write about i always end up complaining in letters, and then i feel like a right arse coz i start putting myself down. Not good. Big mess. Messier than Daniel with naked pics of Orli.   Anywayz, the name is concerning my latest attempt at script writing. The basics (and the not so basics):  Title: "Boing!"  The story concerns a group of teenagers who live together for the duration of a theatrical course. Based on my own experiences at SYT, it follows the relationships developed during the course.  Billy being pretty much the main character, his relationship with Danny is the most developed. The two of them meet, are shoved into a romantic relationship that everyone pretends is the best thing to ever happen. Unfortunately, although there is a sexual link between the two boys, they dont really "mesh". Danny only seems to be going out with Billy because he's there, he's single, and he's willing, while Billy has a lot to learn about dealing with relationships (especially with people as sensitive and quiet as Danny).  Other relationships include that between Kate and her boyfriend David (who is never seen), Emma and Guy (who falls for her after they drunkenly sleep together one night), friendships between Arlene and Claire, Billy and Vanessa, Vanessa and Maria and Emma and Ali. Full of stupid characters, but they just have to be in there.  Following from the end of the second week of the course (out of five), we see the group getting ready to go out for Billy's 16th birthday. Unfortunately the electricity in the dorms blows, forcing the whole place onto really weak backing power - No one is allowed to leave the building. Instead, the kids bring the party to them, sitting in the almost dark, drinking, dancing, singing, getting into strange situations with Italian boys who are sharing the dorms.  Aint it just my life all over? :P  Anywayz, following this night there are a load of relationships started up, and the whole thing carries on from there.  The whole idea behind the play is the theme of our handling of imperfections. Like with Billy i've had to put a lot of energy into writing, partly because i've had to criticise Danny fairly and reasonably, while at the same time bring out his insecurities regarding his own faults.   This theme is also where the title comes in:  In the game of Woosh, which the group play as a concentration exercise, certain commands can only be used under certain circumstances. "Boing!" is one such command. The point is that Billy is on the whole a relatively patient person, but Arlene's constant use of "boing!" in the wrong context silently drives him nuts - it is her innattentive nature (her imperfection) which sets off Billy's impatience (his imperfection).  And thats about it. Not a lot left to explain. Should have it finished soon, but i do have a life to live you know!     ....alala....

With the prom dress, however, i went for a more realistic view of the bodice, joing the breast-pieces into one, but keeping above and below the chest bare....  Man i am soooo gay!

      Oh dear me.  Higher Biology was scarily easy, which means either the SQA wer lettin their standards drop (standards which are too ridiculously high and irrelevant in the first place) or it means that i have completely bombed the whole fuckin thing.  YAY fun!  Maths tomorrow, which i have no clue wot im doing in. I wont lie: i havent studied as much as i couldve. I have confidence in my skills. I have confidence in myself. And i am completely confident that tomorrow i will go in there, sit down, get out my pen and calculator, and be torn limb from limb by that bloody paper.  YAY more fun!  Not that it interests anyone, but i got my first letter from my pal Maz today since...well...since ever. We met last summer at Scottish Youth Theatre, spent the whole five weeks as best mates and then only saw each other once since. I've already written my reply. Hers wasnt the only male i got this morning. Four envelopes. Four! My mum is one of a very cloe-knit family of seven. We are all very close with our aunts and cousins etc. And i can honestly say i dont even get four envelopes in one day when its my birthday!  Number One was Maz's letter (YAY!)  Number Two was a letter from SYT concerning this project i was supposed to be working on with them, being playwrighting assistant for a couple of weeks till they get it completed.  Number Three was a letter from the council's education board telling me they couldnt financially support me for SYT.  And number four was a letter from the council's education board...giving me an application form so they could financially support me for SYT. Bizarre, non?  And OMG tonight was the second last ever episode of Friends. I've known the whole story of the final arc for months (i'm sneaky when it comes to lookin up spoiler sites, then casually droppin stuff into conversations with massive fanatics. heehee im evil.) I was nearly cryin', but thanks to Chandler's nice addition of fart jokes i managed not to.   Emz and I are good again, Arlene WAS over David until about twenty minutes ago ('twas her 17th b-day today. Happy boyfday sweetie-pie, havent spoken to Claire since yesterday and Danny is all like blondily highlighted now, which is kool (and really not helpful in the fight to prove his heterosexuality).    Ryan is being a teensy bit weirder than usual (which, ya know, who cares?!), Daniel is going away to Gay Paris next week without me (the sexy beast!), and Maz is comin down to seeee meeeee!!! YAY! Everythins goin good!    And now its not. Coz i just remembered...  Ahhh maths! Bloody maths! All trigonometry and differentiation and pencils! Dems evil, dem pencils.    DAMN YOU PENCILS!

      I appear to be a little hurt. Emma has mistaken some shit i said, and it's really upset her. An incident occured a little while ago, which i wont discuss because its not my place to discuss it, but it left Emma as emotionally bruised and battered as she was physically.  I've always tried to be there for her. I've made as big an effort as i could've made, or so i thought. Turns out, i wasnt helping - just offending her. She's posted a lot of stuff surrounding the event on her own blog, whose addy i cant give you, and with it some things i said that she misinterpreted as me doubting her or claiming to understand what she's going through.  I love this girl. I truly do. I would give up my life for her. And now it turns out she deep-down hates me because she thinks im that arrogant and insensitive. And now i think i might be too. When i said "if you're making any of this up i'll fucking kill ya" it was said in a jokey tone, with jokey intentions. Even she laughed after it. But for some reason she thinks it was me telling her i didnt trust her.  I told her on Friday i was still worried for her, and that we could all still see she was scared and hurting...and i must be doing something wrong when i speak because she took that as being along the lines of "i understand what you're going through".  But i am worried about her. I'm worried about her because she hasnt been able to resume a proper social life. Shes been off school so much her original reason for moving to Scotland from Canada has sort of been demolished, since she'll end up having to resit certain exams for courses she's missed half of. She can't trust even those who are there for her, and that doesnt hurt us. We understand that she doesnt trust us, and cant. It doesnt stop us being there for her.  But now i think it would be a better method of helping her through things by just not opening my mouth around her. I thank God she didnt hear half of what was said when people turned against her, or she wouldnt trust anyone ever again. I dont think even i could after hearing what they said.  I love her. I want to be there for her. But i dont wanna hurt her anymore by being there for her. Turns out the original idea of not tip-toe-ing around her has backfired, because instead of her feeling better because at least something has remained constant, it woulda been better if some of us in particular had changed.

      Okay i have a confession to make.  I'm a slut. I know it. You know. The whole world fucking knows it. But i'm getting sick of it.  I know the possibility that Daniel or Greg is gonna read this and hate me for admitting this, but i have to. And besides, they already sorta knew.  The deal is this: I am only just coming up to 17, with my exams occupying most of my time between now and the summer, and then im spending practically the whole summer working with Scottish Youth Theatre. Plus i'll be writing on here all the time, so i really have little spare time between now and September. I have no time for proper relationships, and it would be unfair to get into one - like buying a dog and leaving it at home all day while u go to work.  That doesnt mean im about to do without sexual activity though. And would you deny me it?   Recently i've been "seeing" 5 guys. They all know about each other, we're all very inexclusive, and i havent been sleeping with any of them or fucking them around. So anyone who wants to call me a slut can find a decent arguement first...    ~ Greg i like. Lovely. Black as well, so its very much a turn-on. I've known him longer than the other four, but if i ever had anything with him it would be purely sexual. I couldn't get emotionally involved with him...too clingy.   ~ Ross. Used to talk to him a lot, and he doesnt currently have a boyfriend. But hes been looking for a bit on the side. Not sure i could do that to his boyfriend. Or myself.   ~ Jamie i feel bad about. He's 18. Percussionist from RSAMD that i met at one of his concerts. What we have is only sexual. Bearing in mind i havent slept with any of them. So as far as it's gotten so far was a meeting last Tuesday for an outdoor-oral-sex experience. It makes me feel dirty just thinking about it. And i think i like that feeling.   ~ Ryan is now over. Half an hour ago he was dramatic, condescending and patronising to me for the last time. I'm hardly one to talk, but he's a collosal geek who overreacts with everything and thinks the way to a guys heart is to inform him that he "gave a bj in a public toilet today". Ick.   ~ And last, but by absolutely no means least we have Daniel. Who i love. I'm not in love with him, but theres so much about him i love. He's such an utter dork it is massively cute. His eyes are gorgeous and just scream sincerity, and his smile makes me melt. He's coming over on tuesday for a nice day of sitting about doing "nothing". I seriously can't wait, not just because i'll be getting some ;) but because i'll be near him.   And i just realised - what the hell is my dillemma again?! Why the hell not Daniel? DUH! The problem i have is that while im getting emotionally invested in this, so is he, and so i have to keep reminding him as well as myself that i cant get into anything exclusive just now.     DAMMIT!

      Okay so maybe this does involve stupid stories.  Don't care.  This morning was my first Higher exam, which are, for those of you that aren't Scottish and dont know about our education system, the senior exams that universities and employers tend to focus on.  Today was English. Fun.  How bloody super-powered do they really think we are? We are 16 year olds, the laziest age-group in almost every society  EVER!  And they expect us to not only go through a 50 mark Close Reading in and hour and a half, and then two essays inside the same time?! No notes allowed in, no texts, no idea of the type of questions you'll be asked, with the SQA (Scottish Qualifications Authority) having no idea of what texts you've studied.  TWO FUCKING ESSAYS?! GET THE FUCK REAL!  It was awful. There were only two questions i could've done, and with both of them i had to twist the arguement like nobodys business.  Anyway last night i barely slept. My bladder is worrying me now too: i had to get out of the exam hall twice this morning to pee, having already gone to the toilet before the first paper and before the second paper.  Of course you don't care about any of this. At all. And do i blame you?  Nope. Coz you're probably not even reading this in the first place, so i dunno who the hell i think i'm talking to.        "GRAB A BOTTLE, HUNKER DOWN, AND PRAY FOR DAYLIGHT!!!"

That's what happens when Barry White comes on your walkman: you and everyone in a five metre radius seems overcome by Ally McBeal sydrome - the inability to resist boogyin' down to " The first, the last, my everything ".

      I'm worried about Becca. She's not talking to me, which is fantastic behaviour for a best friend right before she leaves school and never sees you again.  Last week she found out that Cat has been upset with her. Seems our little Rebecca has been being a massive bitch to poor Catherine, unintentionally of course. Cat is very sensitive about her ears (God only knows why - the girl's a sex-goddess), and apparently Becca made some jokey comments about them. I have to agree she hasnt really been herself recently - she does seem slightly more arrogant, self-involved and uncareful when it comes to people's feelings. I doubt it's her own fault, but she worries me none-the-less.  And now she has decided it is good enough for her best-friend of three years, who helped her through so much and relied on her for so much, to just say "See ya", hop on the bus as per usual, and not even wave as she gazes out of the bus window as it crawls past. Not a phone call, no hugs or kisses, no nothing. Not like her.      urlLink    Here she is: Becky-Boo, a little too under-expectant of the zooming capabilities of my camera. Look how purdy she is. Awwww. And there's Kenneth's ear too!

I really have nothin interesting that i can think of to say right now, besides that i'm sitting here, freezing my ass off in my baggy jeans and a bodywarmer (no top underneath it - im being adventurous).  Okay stuff is starting to come to me...  Some irrelevant background knowledge (although if anyone has been stupid enough to read this they will soon turn away):  Badness is  not  good. Please remember this.  Okay so i'm a 16 year old gay guy living in just one of many busy parts of breezy Scotland. I'm an aspiring actor and playwright (in fact just remembered i was gonna write the penultimate scene of my gross-out comedy tonight...oh well...doin this instead), with a sense of humour that swings from bitter and witty to dirty and terribly bitchy. I am, if nothing else, honest. You have been warned.  However, i do warm up to people quite easily. I'm not an offensive person, but i stick to what i believe and will fight to the death for what i feel is right. Not an awful person. But i'm fuckin annoying!  Another universal truth to remember. Just because a boy is gay, it does not make him a girl. My little cousin would do well to think of this in future before making comments in front of the 5 year old cousin who adores me. Little slut. Seriously - too much sausage in too little skin. What twelve year old dresses like that at a first communion, i ask you?!  Bloody hell.  Time to go.

      I have been dumped.  Yes, it is true, i have indeed been dumped. Im fine, but im starting to get angrier by the minute. As an arguement with mother escalated earlier in the car, i suddenly burst into tears with no clue why. And it has been discovered - all the times ive been near crying or thought i could cry, i actually havent done, and now its all built up. Five years of hormones let go in one, and i could probably still go if i have to listen to "All By Myself" one more time today.  Anywayz, as if that wasnt enough i came on here this afternoon to find an angry Nicola Corrigan having a go at me for stuff i said to David last nite. Following the dumping i handled it as i do everything - i put on a brave front and make innocent jokes, in this case to also show no hard feelings and all that. So i was like "och ye were a crap kisser anyway" and all that. And i was taken seriously, despite telling David i was only kidding. Jesus people i know mine isnt the best but a sense of humour would be nice to come across. Why does everyone take everything so seriously?  Yes so im angry, because people who knew me better than David believed i could be that intentionally hurtful, which is just insulting. Also - YAY! Im being blamed for it!  He spent basically ten minutes telling me he didnt wanna be in the relationship anymore. Come on, would u expect me to wanna be in a relationship where the other person didnt wanna be in it for much longer? I didnt wanna cause any more confusion or panic attacks for him, and i didnt wanna have to be in a relationship in that he didnt wanna be in! So i said "if you dont do it, i will". AND GUESS WHAT?! EVERYONE (and i mean everyone) that he spoke to last nite was told that i gave him an ultimatum. Which means that Aaron, Nicola, Sarah, Jason and possibly even Jude now thinks that i wanted him to break up with me, and that i forced him into it.  I FUCKING WOULDNT!!!!  I've liked the guy for over a year, and as far as i was concerned things were going good till tuesday. The fact he wasnt happy hit me like a ton of fucking steel-coated bricks, and people actually believe i would FORCE him to dump me?!  I've decided...consciously...i hate you all!

      Well dear bloggie and whoever bothers their arse reading this (yeah, one person! Great!, this may be my last entry for the next five weeks, and perhaps forever. I dont know if after SYT, beginning this monday, "What Was I On?!" will be picked up for a second season. Depends on if the writer can bother his ass which is right now thinking maybe not.  David's confused. Ive been through some fucking mass of emotional shit today because he told nicola stuff last nite about how he feels as if hes been rushed (which is very unfary considering i havent pushed for ANYTHING! Not a minute!). Anyway, she was apparently "allowed to tell me if she wanted to", and she did this morning. I am so fucking angry and could actually cry, i think. I understand, coz ive been there myself with the whole confusion thingy, and i know this isnt an easy time for him either, but even when i tried to talk to him tonight i was ignored for ages, then told that he and Sarah wer watching a movie, then ignored summore, then finally told that Sarah sed he was to log out coz people talking was disturbing the movie. Why cant he talk to me? Why do i have to hear about his problems with me through Nicola? Is this a threeway fucking relationship or what?! Does he not want me? Was it Tuesday that put him off? Was it seeing me topless that did it? HES FUCKING CONFUSED!!!

      I have been acting like such an idiot. David thinks i was being weird when i left his house yesterday and i consciously wasn't. There was nothing wrong, as far as i knew, but i wouldnt be surprised. He didnt do anything wrong, and we'd had a fantastic afternoon. But i sat last night and just cried. For no reason. And people who know me know i dont cry. I can get a bit teary, sure, and i can be crying inside, but it doesnt happen too often on the outside. There was no reason for it that i could see.  It's probably just that i've been feeling really *wrong* these past few days. I seriously keep feeling something bad is going to happen, soon, but i dont know what it is or if anything's gonna happen at all. But i just cried. I sat with my legs up on the couch, shivvering (it wasnt particularly cold), feeling as though i was going to choke, and just cried silently into myself. And it's really worrying me now.  On top of that, i just turned down an afternoon with David, which i totally wouldnt ever do. I was gonna go to his house for a while, and then we were gonna go shoe-shopping with Nicola in Hamilton. And i bloody turned the invitation down. Everything so far with him has been just about perfect - why would i wanna not go?! I've let go of my insecurities and everything. I mean, he wants to be with me right now, and i wanna be with him, and ive accepted it all. It doesnt seem so much like a dream anymore. But i still have this feeling that i've screwed it by the way i acted yesterday at his house, which it'll turn out i didnt. But what am i to expect when i have all this baggage from rejection and being used for sex? Stupid fucking guys! They screw you over when you're seeing them, and then when you finally find the really good one the walls they built are still in the way.  I really dont know what to do, and im having whole periods of non-David related thought (for the first time in a while :P). It's not that im going off him in the slightest: not at all, im just worried. Im worried about how ill screw this one up too and im worried about what this big, bad-thingy is thats gonna come and leave a bunch of people in pain. It would just be so typical that i'm this happy with someone, and then i let something like my fears get in the way, or somebody kills one of us.  That's irony for you. Oh isnt life just a hoot and a half?   Need to go to the library for mother, need to post thingy for my £450. What an eventful day im gonna have. Why oh why did i jst reject that invitation?!       You say i only hear what i want to. You say i talk so all the time so.  And i thought what i felt was simple, And i thought that i dont belong. And now that i am leaving Now I know that i did something wrong coz i missed you.  You say i only hear what i want to. I dont listen hard, dont pay attention to the distance that you're running To anyone, anywhere. I dont understand if you really care Im only hearing negatives: no, no, no.  So i turn the radio on, i turn the radio up And this woman was singing my song Lover's in love, and the other runs away. Lover is crying coz the other wont stay.  Some bodies hover as we weep for the other  Who was dying since the day they were born Well this is not that: I think that im throwing but im thrown.  I thought id live forever, but now im not so sure You try to tell me that im clever But that wont take me anyhow or anywhere with you.  You said that i was naive When i thought i was strong I thought "Hey, I can leave, i can leave" But now i know that i was wrong, coz i missed you.  You said, "you caught me coz you want me and one day you'll let me go. You try to give away a keeper, or keep me 'cause you know you're just scared to lose." And you say, "stay."  You say i only hear what i want to.         Paging, Crazy...that's Crazy to the reception desk. Thank you!

      Okay so this aint quite as much later as id thot id be updating, but hey! Its an update...any complaints?  Whats that Charlie Brown?...No you cannot "sex" the aubergine...Well for one thing it would get stuck, and for another...EUW NO!  Back to business.    David. David David David David David. We spent this afternoon together, as you do, em...*conversing* in each of the places mentioned in my previous post. It's none of your business what we got up to, so don't ask me to tell you.  All i can say is i'm still very happy. There was a definite bit of "kinky" in his behaviour today, so he seemed to be feeling adventurous. Was fun, and a good laugh. We somehow managed to still get interupted by stomach's growling, mobile fones going off at inappropriate moments and his hair getting in the way (which i dont care about anymore). I think he might be trying to make me slow down a bit, because i am getting rather attatched to the boy, and i dunno if he's at the same place i am. "I really really like you." got met with "I like you too."  I'm not bothered if he's not clicking with me as much as i am with him. I mean, obviously its a massive disappointment, but its not like i expected goodness forever with him. We started going out without knowing much about each other, and even with my dodgy looks my personality is hardly winning me Miss Congeniality 2004.  And my God i need to get over this paranoia! Obviously he likes me, coz he aint ditched me yet and he did say yes to me in the first place when i asked him out. DUH! Andrew totally get over yourself. There it's done. Im over myself. He likes me. YAY! Please disregard the above rant about myself being not nice. I am nice. :D Arent i?  Anywayz, its not just *activities* that we enjoy with each other. We were on the fone from before midnight till after 5am the other night talking about so much. Ex-boyfriends of mine and the effects afterwards, our family situations, his CD collection, his favourite food (heehee...now thats between the two of us), his addiction to milk, our childhoods, our friendships and how long they've lasted...tons and tons more stuff. It was positively brilliant. Actually the first foneconvo ive had in ages where it hasnt been interrupted by something else, and the first one in ages that i didnt want to end.  Duuuuuuuude.

In David's bedroom, in David's kitchen, in David's livingroom, in David's kitchen again in David's bedroom again, at the top of David's stairs, and in David's bedroom AGAIN. Oh and on David's stairs, then on David's stairs, then on David's stairs and in David's porch x5.  Can you tell i had a good afternoon?!

Oh and the boy in the background, Craig, is another previous love interest. Not as hot as he used to be though, and he was a bit stalkery when he and Karen broke up. But everyone suspects he's gay so its okay.

      Okay soooo....:D have spent a couple of days without David, but he's gonna fone me as soon as he's in from school tonight and we're gonna do something tonight. Then i MIGHT pop down to his house for ten minutes tomorrow, coz, lets face it - he'll have the house all to himself, and it would just be rude not to stop by to say a quick hi-and-goodbye. For some reason he doesnt find that satisfying however, and may force a longer stay on me.  Lemme tell you, if this bloody great zit doesnt go away i aint going anywhere, i dont care how "smitten" i am. Screw smitten - i wanna be cleeeeeeaaaaan! How come no matter how much you shower you still end up with spots?! I scrub with perfectly good, soap-free shower products, and rinse as perfectly as possible. WHY GOD?! WHAT DID I EVER DO TO YOU?! :'(    All i really wanted was some of your time Instead you told me lies when someone else was on your mind What'd you do to me?  Look what you did to me. I thought that you were sumone who would do me right Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry What'd you do to me? Can't take what you did to me.    Sorry, just love that song. No reflection on how i feel.  Well there's only one word for yesterday - "eventful".  (1) Mum found out about David. (2) I had my hospital appointment. (3) Maureen had her new bouncy baby boy.   -> (1)Yeah, i awoke to a fone call from mum concerning how i was to fone my father (having found out that North Lanarkshire Educational Dept are giving me £450 for SYT! YAY!). She also happened to mention that we needed to "talk about trust", and then revealed she had been reading my text messages. Well we certainly did need to talk about trust, considering she'd been butting in to my business. Anywayz, we talked it out and after a BIG arguement we sorted things out. She's still having trust issues with me, although she has a cheek, and is still moody. She thinks i'm going off on one like i'm crazy or something, as if i'm on a destructive pathway that'll only lead to jail or my untimely death. *Pfft* I love you mother, and i understand that you worry...but get real.  -> (2)It wasnt actually as bad as i thought it would be. The CT scan i have to go in for was pretty much an expected (although apparently there was no reason to suspect it - mum). The brain-mapping and four different blood-tests were new though. The doctor says that i have a weakened nervous system, which happens pretty much only to people my age, and that it'll all go away eventually. In the meantime im stuck with the headaches and the passing out, but im fine with it. Ive had them both long enough to be used to them. Plus my threshold for pain, cold, heat and other stimuli is stronger because of the weaker nervous impulses going to my brain. Seems it's a blessing as much as a curse, and it would probably explain the very hot and very cold showers i manage to have, as well as the never-wearing-a-jacket-coz-i-dont-feel-i-need-one thing that drives mum mad.  -> (3) Speaks for itself doesnt it? At sometime after 10am, my aunt and godmother Maureen Murray gave birth to her second child, a second son. 12 ounces i think. Possibly not. Anywayz....AWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!! I really woulda gone to the cinema with David if i couldve last nite, but AWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!! Duuuuuude, he was soooo teeeeeeny-weeeeeny, as babies usually are. They wont end up naming him for like two weeks (thats how long it took to decide a name for Jamie, theyre first son, who looked adorable seeing his baby brother for the first time...i was actually near tears watching him). However, that stopped no one from suggesting names. Our reccomendations included:  Matthew Murray Fernando Murray Mad-Dog Murray Jebediah Murray  and, of course, my own invention:  Canestan Murray.  Dude they should soooo call him that!  Anywayz, i think im gonna copy and paste this into my LiveJournal, and then im gonna get back to me exercising to get all fit and toned for Davey-Wavey. I jst gotta get rid of a little bit of fat to make my abnormally shaped pecs solid muscle instead of looking like manboobs.  Peace out biatches!  xxxxxx

      Im letting go, and moving on surprisingly easily. In case you all thought he was jst a bastard, he wrote me a letter. I told him how happy i am with David, and how i really wanted it to work out. If he only understood how i feel about David...Now i have his acceptance, his blessing, and with it...this:   "Dear Andi  I thought that I would write this in a letter, because saying it over the internet wouldn't seem right, and I would be too scared to say it to your face. There were a few things I wanted to say, but I didn't know how, but following Monday night, I think I can.   Over the last few months I've changed a lot. I'm now a lot more open, more out-spoken, and to a greater extent, MUCH more in touch with who I am. And I have you to thank for that. You've given me so much that I couldn't even begin to thank you. But the one thing that I do thank you for most of all, is your friendship. To quote, well you, "you've become one of the best" and I really do mean that. I thought that I would be upset at the end of our "relationship", but I wasn't. You know why? Because it made me realise just how much I'm going to adore our friendship. You're such an amzing guy, and you don't realise that. As pathetic as it may sound, I am actually honoured to be your friend. I'm looking forward to the days when I can come into Glasgow to meet you, we can have a laugh and go home. I know that this is going to work, because I know that you and I have a connection that can't be broken that easily. As a friend, I love you to bits, and I'm so happy that I get to keep you in my life.  I really hope you go for it with David. Even though I don't know him, if he is able to make you that happy, then he's definately a keeper! I can't wait to hear on msn "Oh guess where David and I went" or "David said the funniest thing". I know we'll both support each other in whatever we do, and for that we'll be better people.  One last thing to say (if you're still awake!) is that now you get to fufill your wish of setting me up with random guys in the hope that I meet someone special. Not that this'll be the case too often (I mean hey! I managed to snag you for a bit didn't I?) but still I think it would be nice. And now we get to fufill MY dream! Of having my very own queer as folk posse complete with sex, booze and club 18-30 holidays! But not to look to far into the future........  Anyhoo, I feel that Ive written all I can without going off into a tangent about vagina's or random statements, so I think I'll stop.  Talk to ya soon lil buddy Always yours Daniel xxx"    David, might be soon to say stuff like this:  But im all yours...(Come and get me big boy! heehee :P)

      Davids at work. How sad is it that i miss him? Like sooo sooo sad!   Anywayz, jst thot id post coz Ryan's pissing me off. Yet again. Man its like the boy feels that because he's gay he has to tell the world and make it a huge statement. He's the sorta person you cant really trust when he says hes gay, because he uses it as such an attention-tool, all like "oooh oooh look at me and how individual i am!" He's also the sorta person that jst cant accept that people being mean or slightly disciminative to him could be about something other than his sexuality. Tell him he's talking shit, or the colour he's choosing for his hair might look a bit silly, or get pissed off at him in any way, shape or form, and its like his head goes:  "Hmm...AutoClass: That must be homophobia!"  He's fighting this huge battle that there just isnt in his school or with his parents or where he lives. Nobody would give a shit if he didnt act like such a tosser because of it. He might claim to be standing up for equality, but really hes just working for the other side. He's making all gay guys out to be hostile at a time in people's lives when their opinions are shaped most, and he's acting superior.  This is where its like feminism. Feminism, as much as you might like the idea ladies, is not a good idea. It's not right. Feminism literally means making women out to be better than men, and we should actually be fighting for equality instead of fighting against each other for domination. Thats what Ryan's attitude towards being gay is.  He also thinks that coz he's gay he's gonna have lots of sex...and, eh, im sorry Ryan, but unless you're a nice person (let alone at least okay looking) and dont push away everyone who ever tries to help because you're "an individual", then you've got no chance. People dont wanna be with touchy, high-maintenance people who cant let sumone get close to them. And at 15, how many people do you think you're gonna have sex with? How many gay guys do u personally know that arent over 23? You are my friend, and as much as i have a huge gripe with u i care what happens to you. Being fifteen and actually looking for sex with strangers is not a good idea.  Thankfully, despite your better efforts, it hasnt happened yet.  And you are not "an individual" in this respect. Gay people might still be in the minority, but while you've been unintentionally and thoughtlessly pushing us further away from public acceptance, we've grown in number. We are closer to not being a minority. Still a bit away, but we're closer, and it hasnt been much thanks to you or me. Individuality means not conforming, and thats exactly what youve done. Youve thought that being gay meant you were unique, had something to prove to the world, something to battle day and night against - some terrible homophobic monster that would eat you if you let your guard down. You saw it as a statement. And its not. We are not stereotypes. We are not all hairdressers, dancers, stylists. We are not all totally against the government or the Bible or any faith at all. We do not all go to Mardi Gras, find transvestitism a personally liberating form of expression, and we do not all enjoy partying. And we do not all go out and have random sex.  Personally, even during my recent slutty period i didnt go as far as to want anal sex with strangers. Still virgin. And if i didnt know the guy i took precautions.  Maybe im hypocritical, as i hear you say...kinda. But im not. At least i dont think so. I went through a stage like this, where i felt like this. I went through slutty periods. But none of it went as far, or on for as long, as this. I kicked my own arse out of it. I felt like making a statement, like fighting the system. But i didnt. I kept it to myself. I was gay, and everyone who asked knew it. But I did not go around waving a banner and screaming.  "Im Here, Im Queer, Get Used To It"  Who wasnt used to it in the fucking first place?! Thats the sorta thing you say to people who are proven homophobes, not regular people.  You insult them, and worse, i find you're actions and reactions insulting to my sexuality and who i am personally. It's a personality trait. It is not WHO you are - it is a PART of who you are.     P.S. David hunni i hope ur not in from work too late this evening ;) Wanna organise something special...

       urlLink    DAVID!!!! Not a brilliant pic of him, granted. But he's still hot in it, and he manages to be (somehow impossible for anyone else on the planet) to be ten times hotter in real life!!! Check the jaw line! The eyes! The smile you cant see! The hair that changes every two weeks! HOOOOOOOOTTTTNEEEESSSSSSS!!!!!! I'll post a better pic as soon as i get one, but i couldnt NOT put a pic of him on here. To be truly astounded, you must see him in real life.

      Okay...okay...okay...ehm...........okay.  Jeezo....  heehee I gotta stop saying that when i dunno wot to say.    "You would think that people woulda had enough of silly love songs..." alala   Dammit. I cant stop singing, or smiling, or wanting to dance and im just sooo happy and i just want him to be here right now and...damn.   Well, again, lets start with Daniel. I totally sorted things out with him, and i love how mature he was about it (not that i expected any less). We are now officially just friends, and its gonna stay that way. It would have to - coz now im all HAPPY with someone else. And there's no question that the someone else is who i wanna be with.  And now onto the main course, our feature presentation, our cover model. DAVID!!!! Mr David...Mr David...alala...  Man he is sooooo hot!  Right, okay, right...oh god...:D :D :D :D im too busy smiling and singing to concentrate.  Yeah, so after i got in on Sunday morning following the loverly party at Ali-Bally's, came in the house and spent a couple of hours with mum and on here. Then David invited me down to his to watch 'The Craft' with him and Nicola and Lynn. Needless to say, the two of us didnt see an awful lot of the movie...and Nic and Lynn didnt hear an awful lot of it either, which Nicola kept drawing us daggers for. We just made out for ages, bein really really flirty and stuff, fighting over the remote. Then we went for a walk up to McDonalds and even sitting at the train station we couldnt keep our hands off each other.  After that, Nicola invited the two of us to stay at hers, and we (or at least I) spent the whole evening in anticipation of people going to bed so we could be all over each other again ;). As soon as the very drunken (and kinda pervy for an old guy) Brian had left, me and David and Nic went to the large living room to watch Scooby Doo 2. Well all i can say is thank god her house was kinda cold! David was complaining bout being kinda cold, which was kinda cute in the "its so obvious you want me to warm you up" sorta way. So i did. I did the nice, good-Samaritan thing and warmed him up. For hours.  Of course all this was interrupted by the occasional brilliant bit of Scooby Doo 2, which we jst had to watch, and the teasing of Nicola over Brian, which i now think i took a bit farther than i shouldve. Was very funny, but got quite cruel.  Anywayz, Nicola forced us to go to bed. Not a good idea Nicola - like we were gonna sleep?! She's been great about this, being all happy and stuff for us. I havent seen her in so long, but recently me and Nicola have been getting closer again and i just have so much to thank her for: getting me and david together, introducing us in the first place, and being brave enough to face the possibility that she'll be stuck in the middle of any messes between me and him (which i pray there arent any of). I couldnt have asked for a better friend recently.  Anywayz, we spent hours in her lil bro's bed (does sound kinda dirty now, but didnt at the time), making out, getting a little bit adventurous and stuff. Just your basic experimentation that leaves you absolutely ecstatic and all on a high and stuff. And then we fell asleep. Oh wait - this was after all the distracting stuff that i coulda killed Nicola (txting bout her vibrator: "hhhowwww dddoooo yyoouuuu ttuuurrrnnn theeee fffuckkkkerrrr offfff?"), the shelf and fireplace that both decided to attack David, and our stomachs growling (id love to say it was because we wanted each other so badly, but it was probably coz we hadnt eaten). But none of it mattered, like at all, and we just spent the whole morning kissing.  Then we were awkwardly awoken by said lil brother, who was rather confused and stammered bout having to get his school stuff. Heehee. The look on his face. And all i could say was "Jeezo" when really i was dying to just jump right back on top of David.  When i had to leave i just couldnt. I mustve spent ten minutes saying goodbye to him. Id planned on just the normal little peck on the lips to say bye, but somehow he ended up against the wall with me pressed against him. I dont think he wanted me to leave either, judging by how he was holding me.  The boy is actually driving me crazy, and i know ive said most of this in my LiveJournal for those who read it. But he's just...perfect. And even his imperfections that i know of so far are great and fascinating and just make me want him more. I soooo want the feeling i have just now to last for as long as humanly possible, or even better the feeling i had the other night at Nicola's. I wouldnt even need to be kissing him for that long. It does sound, as Daniel would put it, very "cancer-movie" but just seeing him smile in that way when we've just kissed, and he knows we're gonna kiss summore, makes me so wanna just pin him down and do naughty things...lol just joking. Okay not totally, obviously coz hes my boyfriend and im very sexually attracted to him as well as his personality kicking ass. But im taking it as slow as he wants. I've had and seen too many relationships wrecked by rushing into things, and i wont push him. Im now completely off my "King of Slutdom" phase, and i honestly cant see me going back to it anytime soon. Im happy enough right now with what i have, and if it keeps feeling half as good as this, then im like him: i want this to work.  Man i know half of this is sad, but i dont care.   Im so freaking happy.  I could just sing forever now.

      Apologies first to Daniel. Last time you were hurt by what i said in this without talking to you first. So if u feel that way, leave it until we talk, and dont read any more of this. Because you would not like me very much after it unless we talk first.       David david david david david david david david david...*ahem*...sorry..."Sumone" was at the Catty with me last night.  Yes he was.  :D :D :D :D I cannot smile enough to tell you how happy i am right now. When he finally worked up the courage to kiss me, my heart leaped out of my chest (and boy was he surprised :P). Oh sweet Jesus.  AAAAH YAY! God i dunno how to describe it im just all...WOOH! He dances (essential), his friends are nutcases (heehee i kno i keep mentioning him "Someone", but Aaron is GOD...heehee..."sexing") who dont dislike me apparently, and he can dress himself (another essential)...and i am so not kidding the moment we kissed for the first time just topped every other kiss ive ever had in terms of excitement. Sounds a bit sad i know, but it was so romantic and i can still kinda feel him when i close my eyes.  I didnt think it was gonna happen after a while, and he'd gotten POd at me according to Jason coz id gone off with Nicola to swing dance. But when i came back we made gooooooood! And i seriously have not been so happy in a long long time, and never on this particular scale. All the badness and baggage that ive been holding onto from people, especially Ross, is just all gone. I feel all new and shit, and its prob coz i agree with David on this one: officially the best night of my life.    Then Alice's party. Was okay. Not much. I mean me, her, Erin and Vanessa peed ourselves laffin all morning this morning, but there was badness involving Johnny Daly and the TV getting fucked. Nothing to write home about, but bloody funny.

      oookay i opened this to write about ten minutes ago and now ive forgotten what to say.  You know, not enough people read this. *Sigh*...    Right, so first Daniel. *Sighs again* We seem to have drifted...we aint spoken as much recently, he hasnt texted me, he's started doing blogger entries without me mentioned in them (:'( That just doesnt happen! Its creepy! Anywayz, we dont seem as close as we were. He seems to be treating me more like a friend that he's just flirty with. Which im kool with, but i wish he would just tell me how he feels. I have no problem with it if thats what is to happen, coz friends is all we can be to each other right now. But he seems to not be as attentive as he once was. I kinda miss talking to him.   And secondly, the person who i will refer to as *someone* (since thats how he likes to refer to me on his LiveJournal). Someone likes me. Apparently. And ive liked someone for sooooooo long (did i already talk bout him on here?). I seriously used to fancy him rotten, and recently have started to rediscover this. I'm goin to the Catty tomorrow before Ali's P.A.R.tay, and he'll be there and its all exciting and stuff and AAAAAARRRRGGGHHHHH!!!! I dont know wot im doing anymore!!!! How many people can i fuck about?!?!  One thing though - if this thing with someone gets anywhere past this (which i sooo pray to the God i dont believe in that it does), fucking about would be NOWHERE on the cards. Man i like him so freakin much.

      Sorry for that shit little play-in-one-monologue i jst wrote and posted. Man i really am getting nowhere in the playwright department.  Anyway - big weirdness!!!!   Right - here is the deal. But i might have to take it slowly coz i dont quite understand it.   Maybe a year and a half ago i was at a party at Jamie's house. It was fun. Anywayz, there was this guy there called David...gothy...bisexual, apparently. I wasnt attracted to him that much, but he was a friend of Kit's and she asked me to get off with him, so i did what i usually do. I gave it out to anyone who wanted it. It was okay, but not brilliant, and he did tell me afterwards that i had "sorta a large mouth", which was nice. I stormed off insulted.  Later Kit told me he was being suggestive.  Still that was the end of that. Or so i thought.  The other night Daniel told me about his only other ex-boyfriend. I shat myself. He described a guy that could have been gothy-David (i didnt know much about him), mentioning that this David lived in East Kilbride. I dismissed it anywayz.  Until today. I bumped into Erin (and by "bumped into" i mean "she came on MSN Messenger"), and we were all talky and stuff, just about random shit. And i asked her, just out of a little curiosity if she remembered gothy-David, and she did. In fact, she replied by asking "You mean the one from East Kilbride?"  AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!! NOOOOO!!!!!   I got off with my love-interest's EX-BOYFRIEND (while i think they were still seeing each other, coz David had mentioned he was seeing someone who wasnt too happy with him at the time)!!!! HOW FUCKING CREEPY IS THAT?!?!?!  As Erin said "Small World"  And as i sed "Large mouths"    God forgive me for what im about to do, for it is the gayest thing ever. I shall now sing a song of sixpence, a pocket full of rhye. Four and twenty blackbirds, baked in a ---okay im done.   Yeah here it is, especially for Claire. Won't ever be the same with you gone.  Though we will mourn, thank you for the strength to carry on. We believe in you, and we will always love you.    Some say love: it is a river The drowns the tender reed.  Some say love: it is a razor That leaves your soul to bleed.  Some say love: it is a hunger An endless, aching need.  I say love it is a flower And you, its only seed.     Its the heart, afraid of breaking That never learns to dance.  Its the dream, afraid of waking That never takes the chance.  Its the one who wont be taken Who cannot seem to give.  And the soul, afraid of dying That never learns to live.     When the night has been too lonely And the road has been too long When you think that love is only For the lucky and the strong  Just remember in the winter Far beneath the bitter snows Lies the seed that with the sun's love In the spring becomes the rose.      Goodbye darling.   Isn't it time to fly?

       WARRIOR:  [A little deranged, confused.] I was made to soar. I was made…to… [Coming into proper consciousness] No…no…no, no, no no NO! Damn you!…Damn you!...Damn you. You knew. You knew and…and you knew this wasn’t right. This wasn’t the plan! You bastard. You’re no better than a tease. But…you are better than that. Somehow…I cant explan…but I know you are. So why? Why now? Is it now? Are you…are you teasing now? You’re fucking me about again?  What kind of…This is by far the suckiest thing you have ever done to me, you know that? Tomorrow…I was supposed to….it was all I’d ever lived for, to…to die, tomorrow. It was going to be beautiful…my ultimate brilliance. My final moment, all I’d ever waited for.  To go down…fighting…fighting, and at my peak. And the good fight nonetheless. Not like this. Not like some…decrepit old man, in his sleep, in his…his fucking bed. After all this…you take it away from me? You do this to me? 	I was made to soar! You send all the signs, the opportunity, the battle…and…ARRRGH! The signs! THE FUCKING SIGNS! And yes, i…Why are you playing with me, with my mind? Payback? The years I didn’t pray to you, the way they told me? Having a little bit of originality…They told me to stop doing this…Stop fighting…It wasn’t your work…But it turns out I shouldn’t have? Is that really what you’re telling me? No, that doesn’t warrant this…you wouldn’t…you could, but…but I think you wouldn’t. Then again, could be lies. More lies. More deception. You convince me of so much so easily…so much promise…and then you snatch it back. Give and taketh away, is that what this is? Do I have more tricks to look forward to on this side? The need to fly, those power surges through my body, up my spine…I felt bleeding all over, my hands burned from the inside. And instead…I was dragged out of the fight, put on permanent reserve, just when it fucking mattered!...Grounded…Wingless, no wounds…no spark. Why bleed without a wound? Fly without the feathers? Burn without the flames…you extinguished me…right when you promised I’d light it up…when my fire would roar. I wasn’t your messenger, I know that. I wasn’t anybodies messenger. I wasn’t anything to anyone anymore…not anything…but I was a warrior…and I was going to tear the darkness…I was going to…and now I’m just, what? Gone? Faded? How do I judge when I’m in line for judgement? How do I end it, save others, when I have been ended, and when I cannot be saved? 	I was made to soar. And now I wont. Why be built for a task when there is none? Was I just a factory, making components for a fate that wouldn’t need them? Trust you…you bastard…And just when the fate needs me, I’m out of…out of production? It needs me. They need me. Can you see them? They can’t have me…they cant have me out of this…but they cant have me. Because you…pulled me out. I can’t sit this one out…I cant…I…they cant. They need one more, and I cant let them do this without me. I need to be what they need me to be. And dead is not it. I need to be the extra hand, I could make a difference, but you’ll have me stuck in this fucking place, my body lying there…cold…and I cant even feel it! I cant even feel the cold of lifeless fucking corpse! You would have me here…sitting and watching…when…when I could be cold…when I could be bleeding!…Burning... 	I was made to soar.

      My God! Some shite has been gettin downloaded to my comp without me noticing! Im just listening to Media Player, and the stupid song sung by that stupid (and yet cringingly cute) Pokemon Jigglypuff came on. It disturbs me, that wee balloon resemblin bastard. MAIR LIKE GIGGLYPOOF!  Heehee - listen to me talk. I'm a funny lesbian - OOH IM ELLEN! HAHAHAHAHAAA!! Sorry, heehee, am really quite hyper right now. Possibly coz im knackered and upset!   YAY!  Well today was very eventful. Went to Edinburgh to see "Crazy For You", this George Gershwin musical or summit. Was okay. Matanees - never the best performances (this of course coming from a Mr Sluttykins-Thespian, the Californian stage-gerbil). Choreography was astounding, and ive obviously now realised that im gonna have to add Tap to my repetoire for next year (more on that later).  Anywayz, on the way there it was a bit of a boring trip. We got the backseats, as per usual, while the wee third year shites had to stay down the front. I swear to God they fucked so many people off tonight. They got Maltesers squashed into their bus seats (busdriver threw one hell of a maddy!), talked through the whole thing, and one of them (who i soooo hate - cheeky wee bitch) actually spent half an hour texting in the middle of the performance. Bloody bloody cheek!  I think that pisses me off more coz i respect performers for how much work they put into these things. I know how much it would fuck me off if i was performing and i spotted someone doin that. Cow.  Anywayz...wee shites...moving on.  On the way back, however...  Ive never had so much fun with a tampon. Apparently i was at my comedic best, tampons and Rear of the Year jokes abound. Even impressed Fourth Year Sarah, who i wasnt sure liked me before. But we were roaring with laffter all the way home, even singing the song from that Irn Bru advert. You know:  Everybody in the world loves Irn Bru I Do I Do I Do Me Too  Everybody in the world loves Irn Bru Who does?

      This actually has very very little to do with my name. But what the hell...  My last Higher exam today!!! YAY!!!  STICK A FORK IN ME, IM DONE!  Chemistry...ARRRRRGH! Wasnt brain-wrackingly bad. I either knew the answer or how to do it, or i didnt. Simple. Not stressful. But i wouldnt count on my getting any better than a C, if even a C, so thats brilliant!  Had drama yesterday, which was okay but i completely ended up the most knackered i have been in a long time. That mighta been due to Friday night's complete allnighter, Saturdays collapsing in the wee small hours of the morning and not waking up till bout 6am, and the fact that the exam itself is criminal.  Anywayz am all happy now. Get to sleep, which ive forgotten the feeling of. But tomorrow i gotta get up to go on my last S5 drama trip. George Gershwin musical "Crazy For You" or sumthin like that, in Edinburgh. These things are always a laff, so should have fun.  If i can find that bloody consent form.  DAMMIT!  Anywayz after my thingy today i went for lunch with mother [twas very nice - had the weirdest burger ever, a chickenburger with bacon and cheese...WEIRDO!], and then on the way home stopped in for a rousing three-dance round on the dancemachine.  I actually dont have much to say tonight. Except that Daniel's invited me to stay at his on Saturday night. And i sooo wanna go.   Must convince mum...or get her very uncharacteristically drunk...  Hmmmmm...how?    Milk milk, lemonade, around the corner fudge is made.
