      Hey Ya'll! It is another fine day in the neighborhood. And I would tell you which one but seeing as I am in MD, I have not an actual clue as to which one. Truth be told I think I am in Ft. Meade.  And I am having a ball ya'll. Wow, these are the days that you look back on when you feeling drama. Hmmmm..I think I go back to sleep now, and not to get a "sleep headache". Yes, ya'll I am relaxed. * Did you guys notice that my blogs now are short? Yeah Man!*

      How is everyone today. I'm like so peaceful. No damn drama, gotta love it man. Right now I"m in MD. And I am not fighting and fussing at anyone. I never knew life could be so stress free. I gotta call Kaycee and see what her ass is doing, or if I can get her to do my hair. ( I know you reading this so there is my plea! *begging*) I'm hoping she won't mind cause you know I am bringing my head to her. Must call Kaycee, but the call of the sandwich is great right now...will come back tomorrow....*crunch* *smack* *munch*..

      Last night My dobie "Snoop" gave birth to 8 red pure bred puppies. And this morning her first puppy from he first litter died this morning. Her name was "DoraBlue". The damn dog didn't really like me, she only tolerated me because, well I think it was that I fed her ass. That or the fact that I would have split her damn doggy wig with a cane had she really wanted to be froggy. I did and do feel a little sad and hurt that she died. She had just made her 1st birthday last week Friday. I will miss the way she would try to bite the hell out of anyone coming near her. And the way she would look at me that kinda said " ya know bitch, one day I will...." "DoraBlue" if no one has mentioned it, let me be the first to say, that you weren't a very good dog. I mean you would piss and shit on the damn floor just to make sure your point was heard but you would defend to the death. But even through all that you will be a missed pet. You were the first dog I have ever seen born and die. I will always remember you, "DoraBlue".   Now with that out of the way. Today was my son *A*'s graduation and I was so excited. It didn't got the way any of us planned because my son caught a major case of stage fright and didn't want to repeat his part of the graduation. Ya'll my baby had a part in the whole graduation! And he didn't say one damn line! Talk about someone is so tight. I wanted to beat him and tell him to man up, but thinking back I am happy I didn't because I realize that it would have been counter productive. So instead I will settle more on the positive note. My was dressed to kill ya. He was so damn cute I couldn't help myself. He had on his navy blue slacks and vest with a white shirt and tie. Oh ya'll couldn't tell me nothing.   I was supposed to go to my son's cousin's birthday party but decided that I didn't wanna go cause his mom *D* is on some ole bullshyt man. First of all we all have each other's phone numbers and those who don't have it, can find it just oh so easily. *D* tells all her family members that she was having a birthday party for her son, but her baby's father *M* side, she "somehow" forgot to call us. So I ain't going. She waits until the fucking day before the party to call *M*'s mother on some ole "oh I forgot can you call them please and invite them?"  Naw I can't go. The thing is and ya'll are gonna laugh, she don't like black people.  She is Puerto Rican, ya'll. And she don't. Now keep in mind that *M* is black but he speaks Spanish, so I guess that makes him not black?? Naw bitch you just confused! And then she wonders why everyone ( well I shouldn't say this so..) @#$%^&&* %^&*( $%^*(9 ^%$568  her ass! Look I ain't trying to say folk don't talk about me and all but I'm kewl with that because people are gonna talk. But you know it ain't gonna be about me not being social except when I want damn gifts and shyt cause my fam is broke or whatever the case my be.  Well that's all I'ma say about that...

      Hey all, I have a very peaceful night. Well that could be due to the fact that I went to bed around 6 in the afternoon. So how can I have drama if you are asleep? Hahahaha! You can't! I think I'll go to sleep every night at that time. The secret is to lock your child in the room with you and turn on some sort of cartoon channel and go the hell to sleep! And it works like a charm! Now some side effects are; that when you wake up your child may have wrecked your room more than you thought humanly possible or you may wake up with a "sleep headache". Now I know some of you must be thinking " How the hell do you get a sleep headache?" Well I'll tell you. First of all, you must take your ass to sleep. Secondly, you must keep your ass asleep until the headache begins. Yes I know that this seems like something incredibly stupid to do but let me tell you when you go through the bullshit drama like I do, you will learn to appreciate those wonderfully painful headaches.   For those of you who have been following, my trip to MD begins on Sunday. I am incredibly excited. However after reading kaycee's blog, I want to fight her. I told her hungry self that I would be down there about 2 weeks ago. Now she wants to bring her narrow self up here when I'm trying to get down there? I want you to know that if Kaycee no longer posts....well let's just say that it wasn't pretty!

      Look ya'll, I just spent the last 25 hours awake and going through some drama. My brain isn't functioning correctly right now so, there ain't gonna be much to say. But I have learned a couple of things in these last 25 hours.  1. I will never make nor eat rice and peas, ever, ever (did I mention damnit ever?) again. 2. I can stay awake this long.   I never said what I learned was useful or actually helpful to anyone really. But hey I found them out, the hard way. With that said I must go out and have a so called productive day. Peace, Love and Blessings. Maybe I will one day soon have something pleasant to say in one of these blogs

      First and foremost, I know that this is my second rant about some damn rice and peas but I promise, I will not bring them up again because I will never eat them or feed them to anyone ever, ever again. With that said I will continue.   I found out last night that my S.O.'s mom was telling everyone that I must have picked through the damn rice and peas, because that has never happened to her. Well it has never happened to her cause she never makes them. But it pisses me off because she told me just a few hours before that " Oh *A* I know that you wouldn't have done that. I understand that it was probably an accident." This shyt is just damn madness.   I let my sister *R* read my blog this afternoon, and she said I was stupid (crazy) cause of the stuff I write about. She said I should write a book. I don't think so cause my family would be the only ones to read it. Then they probably wouldn't even wanna buy it and then have the nerve to want a signed copy.   Don't have much to say this blog because I spent a peaceful day with my big sister *R* and my favorite niece *B*  along with my wonderful son *A*. I need to spend the day with them more often but then probably not because it would mean that I have nothing for you guys to read and I know how ya'll love my drama..

      Now I know I didn't post yesterday, well it was because I thought I would have one day, just one day of no drama. Well guess what?? I did any damn way. I made oxtails with rice and peas for dinner last night. Now to the West Indians out there, this goes together like bacon and eggs. My S.O.'s sister *S* makes oxtails but being that she can't cook, all she does to them is put them in a pot and throw onion soup mix over it and boil. Voila! *S*' s oxtails! Now my S.O. has grown up on this so when I make mine with the carrots, onions, butter beans and not fucking onion soup mix! He acts like I'm trying to kill him.   Now last night he asked me to bring him the food I made. Now I told him that I didn't make it the way his sister makes hers. He said fine. Now I bring it to him and he says "Why does it have two different peas in it" What is this ( showing me a carrot)?" I say " A carrot." "Well why are there carrots in this" He complains about the peas in the damn rice and peas! Don't you know what the hell he does?! He eats the rice around the peas ya'll!! What the hell is that?? Then this stupid unwashed asshole, says I, ME, gave him a plate of fucking peas! He tells everyone that I must have purposely scooped out the peas and put in his damn plate. Now he gives me too much damn credit cause I'm just too damn lazy to even think about a way to piss someone of this damn way! WHAT THE FUCK!!!    Ya'll know what, I'm gonna stop this rant before I wanna put a little bleach in his water.

      Does everyone know someone who is gonna be late for there own furnerals? Well I got a family of them motherfukkas. Yesterday was one of my little cousin's birthday party. I woke heads up at 9 am, and asked what time are the festivities to begin. I was told everything starts at 3pm. I'm thinking alright, now I know they always late for something but you know this is their kids 5th birthday party. Not someone else's party but theirs, one they are hosting. I get to the house at 3:15pm. Is the party started? Hell Naw! Hell are these damn people even there?! HELL NAW! I think they need to be beat with a pimp stick! How the hell are you gonna be late for your own kid's shit? Lawrd I don't think I will ever understand what makes people late. If you know you gotta leave your house at 1pm then damn it start getting ready at 11:30. I guess this pisses me of to the heights of pissed-ivity ( yes it is a word, look it up in the KISSMYASS section of Websters) because if you tell me to meet you somewhere at 1 and you show up at 1:10, I left 20 minutes ago! I mean I guess I should understand because they have like 5 kids, but hell 3 of them were already at the other house ready for the party! What the hell! Then had the damn nerve to show up at a quarter to 6. I don't think ya'll understand, damn 5:45pm and the party for their kid now, was supposed to start at 3! Lawrd I need some herbal recreation....  Speaking of, I can't wait to get to MD in exactly one week. I'll be spending two weeks down there with my herbal recreationalist of a cousin (now don't be fooled I have a lot of them in my family tree!). And I finally get to see Kaycee! I miss ya! *sniffle* I haven't seen her in a year and haven't hung out with her since our freshman year of college. That and she still hasn't seen my adorable but bad-as-hell son. I mean she does have pictures, I try to send her one of him everytime I take new ones so when I loose my mind and kill my S.O. she'll know what child she has to pick up from the orphanage. Now I'm not a weed-head per say cause I don't smoke often just when ever I go further than ummm... New Jersey. Now I don't know about you people but I don't smoke till I can't feel my arms and my eyes slam shut on there own. But my fam does and they make me whenever I am with them. Isn't that peer pressure? They just so damn wrong, making people smoke all that and then no one got any damn candy or a sandwich!! The way they are I'll be dirtying my lungs the second I get off the damn greyhound. And good sweet heavens, I can't wait to get there. Now I'll try to write when I get down there but I ain't making no kinda promises. Cause I don't want anyone to know some of the stuff I'll be doin!

      Look for those of ya'll who don't know me, I have always wanted to go and finish college. The whole lifestyle just seemed like it was something I wanted to be involved in. Ever since Lisa Bonet left "A Different World" I was hooked. I know I wanted to go away for college or at the very least attend to get those bonds and friendships that last forever. Alright enough of the college handbook reasons, the real reason was because I hate being poor! Now I know that it doesn't really make sense to spend that amount of money to hope that you will be able to make some upon graduating. But cha know what, compared to what I make now damnit I'm willing to try! Somethings gotta give! Poverty is so not where it is at! This rant is because I got my school bill via e-mail this morning. I have yet to receive my financial aide. Now where the hell am I gonna get money to pay for this? But I am determined to be in class this Fall. If I have to suck dick and sell ass, it will happen. Now for the males who might be reading this, this is a figure of speech. If I get just one e-mail on some "Yo I'm next in line." I will choke you with a dirty sock, burn down your house and the houses of your next 4 generations, then I will shave the heads of all your neighbors. To the females who have probably gotten an attitude over what I said, suck it up with a crack pipe! If you were on your job (or knees) your man wouldn't be trying to figure out my e-mail. Now back to the story already in progress....  Now I'm not trying to say that I live in complete destitute poverty. I am actually I'm guessing lower to middle, middle-class. I have always lived in a house, now don't get me wrong it was a block or two away from the projects but not in them. Not to knock anyone who either has lived or currently lives in the projects but the smell of eau d'pissy hallway was never one of my favorites. I get enough of that riding the J train at night thankyouverymuch. The odor is something that leaves something very much to be desired. Not saying that the odor can't or won't creep up in a house, but you gotta be just brain dead to let that happen in a house.   Maybe I should just take collection from the people I know. I mean wouldn't it be better that I'm begging for money to further my education than for anything else? Hmmm, maybe I should go and find my phonebook. Stay tuned for your next installment of.. Damn glad it ain't me..

      Now I don't mean to say that I am perfect in anyway but DAMN!!! If I ask you to do what I feel are small things please do them. My S.O. (significant other) get on that last good nerve I have just floating around in my head. I ask the fool to put down the toilet seat and does he do it? Hell Naw! I ask him to put his nasty damn draws in the hamper not just next to it, does he do that? Hell Naw! I ask him not to leave his nasty ass nut hair on the bar of soap (now I understand why kaycee only uses liquid soap), does he do it? Hell Naw! I ask him please don't scratch your balls and then put your hands in my food, does he do it?(By the way I've lost a few pounds because of this one) Hell Naw! I ask him please just take the damn trash out, does he do it? Hell NAW!  So by now you are probably asking yourself why hasn't she just beat him in the head with rock-in-a-sock, aren't cha? Well it is because....*sigh*...none of my damn socks are long enough! All I have are those damn ankle socks, no tube socks. So if someone wants to lend me one I promise to wash the blood out of it when I'm done. I don't think that I ask for a lot, now do I? I mean really? I just feel a little respect is due here.  And what is bad is that he is just teaching our son the be a knuckle dragging savage like himself. Grrrr!! And grrrrrr again. I want my son to be the kind of man that a woman can, you know, want to sit down on his toilet seat when she visits his apartment. Drink out of the glasses in his cabinets without fear of swallowing some kind of foreign object, like bug or weird fuzzy purple thing at bottom of glass. I don't ask for much just a little help so some damn little girl won't be calling my house on some "Damn yo' son so Nassstttie!! I mean fo' real do, what is wrong wid him? Was he like raised by wolves or sommin'?" Then I'ma have to go to jail for beating the brakes off her ass. I mean I'm just trying not to go to prison, can anyone understand that man. Well come back tomorrow for your daily installment of unnecessary bullshyt!!!

      Look this is my first time doing this so don't go shooting me down before ya finish reading. I'm quite sure I'll wind up changing this thing several more times before I actually like it. Well, I guess it would be best to introduce my self, n'est-ce pas. So I'm 23 and I have the best 4 yr old son anyone can as for. Ya'll might as well know now that I am incredibly conceited about my son, remarkably not about myself however. I am finally back in college and hoping that I will actually finish. I live in Brooklyn, NY but trying to move because none of my friends live here and it is too damn expensive to stay. My life is pretty much a birth control role model. Delayed in finishing college and having a crappy job. Yup, kiddies if you wanna have kids young then continue to read my blogs and I can gar-run-tee that you will change your mind about kids all together. Today I spent the day trying to get my son enrolled into a parochial school today. The cost is $300 a month. Seems like a lot well that's cheap compared to the $500 I was paying in day care. Well gotta go my damn son wants an ice pop. Will post again later on the glories of motherhood.

      Now it time to say goodbye to all my family! Alright, I have been in MD for 2 weeks now and I am going home tomorrow.  I don't know how I will be getting back, but all I know is that I will be going tomorrow.  I can't really say I will miss Md, just the people in it.  *K* I know where she lives and she will probably be calling the very next day to talk. I am used to that so it won't be so bad. But for kaycee, I am so gonna miss her. We haven't hung out together since we were freshman in college when she was home for Thanksgiving break. And I miss it so. I would have wanted to spend our last day together but she does have to spend it with others and so I have to share. At the very least she is gonna hang out with me tonight. Atleast I hope we go out to night. Hell with that, WE better go out tonight! Even if it is to the damn gas station to pick up some damn gum! I mean we have kept in touch over the years but it is something different, to actually be with a person. It sucks to have your closest friends and family live in another state. I almost wanna cry when I think about how long it will be, before we see each other again. I mean before I came down here the last time I saw her was like 6 years ago. I went through some of the hardest times in my life without her, and it hurts. I know she would have wanted to hold my hand while I was hurting and/or crying but the phone and  e-mail just don't let you do it the way you want to. I don't wanna go home because I will miss her so much but I have to go home because my son *A* is there and I have unfinished business to attend. We are trying to figure out a way for me to move down here and not mooch off of anyone. But that is gonna be a little hard since I don't own a car. Nor can I afford one. And if you look at the previous blog I will never take Metro again because of it sucking. That and  the fact that I would have to find not only employment but decent schooling for my son. Only the best for my boy! I mean I am quite sure I can find some little slum to live in but if I wanna live in the slums they might as well be the ones I grew up with. I refuse to move to another state and be robbed by strangers! I prefer to be robbed by the people I grew up with!  This way I can ID them at the police station. I did meet another person that I will keep in contact with and that a girl named *M*. She's kewl. she got me tickets to a basketball game in DC. She works at the MCI building. The game was alright  except for the fact of the Mystics losing in their own house! Shame! Damn Shame!  On that note, I will go because I have nothing left to say.  In the words of my big sister *R*, VERIZON!  don't ask.....

      Alright ya'll I took the metro last night from DC to New Carrollton, MD. And all I can say is that their whole train system is so ineffiecient! I  hate the way it runs. I had to pay to get on and off! That sucks major hairy, used  tissue lint covered ass! I mean I proved my fare once I got on.  And then the damn doors stay open for forever!  I will never take the Metro again! That and the fact that people don't seem to understand "excuse me but that orange train is the one I need, excuse me". Until you damn near push them out the way to get on your train. This is to the man I knocked down..."ahem...Sir I am incredibly sorry that I pushed you.  I had to get to my train you see, because I wanted to get home. In the future, it would help if you got out of the immediate way when someone says 'Oh shit! that's my train, MOVE!'"  And that's all I have to say about that.

      A few days ago, I accidently washed my cell phone in the laundry. Ever since that day I have been cut off from the people that I know and just so happen to talk to on a daily or semi daily basis. I lost alot of numbers in that cell phone and I was and am completely crushed. I know some of ya'll are saying that if I can't remember the number it wasn't that important. I beg to differ, alot of the people I know live out of state and that different area code is what fucks me up in remembering their number. Not to mention I never really dialed any numbers just what ever number slot I had placed them in. Or if I called them often enough they got a voice memory slot. Now I have had a cell phone since&nbsp;I was 18 and got it for an anniversary present from an evil sonovabitch ex of mine.&nbsp;Looking back I should have realized that he was probably trying to keep a leash on me...eh oh well. &nbsp;Now&nbsp;while I appreciated the phone I do have to&nbsp;admit he started my love affair with cell phones. &nbsp;No more trying to remember phone numbers that I may only call once a damn year and no longer will I have to miss that cute guys call ( well that applied when I was single, not a very long periond but it was there). I felt so useless without my phone, everyone calls me cause I usually have the number everyone wants. No one looks in the phonebook, that has out dated numbers, they call me cause&nbsp;I know that they got their phone cut off and are now using their cousin's baby momma line and I have the number!&nbsp; Now no one calls me for these things. I fell so used and thrown away! I need all my numbers. I used to have everyone's number now I must wait until they call me back. MUWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! And they WILL I say! Yes, you all will call my phone and I shall have my numbers, AGAIN!!!!   Oh yeah I now have a new one! And it is better than ever before! MUWAHAHAHAHAHA! *cough-cough* * wheeze*&nbsp; I gotta stop laughing like that. whooo.

            Yeah I know I haven't blogged in a while but hey I guess I had nothing to really say you know. Um. hm... Well I have watched just about all of Def Poetry Jam and now the entire first season of The L word.&nbsp; And after that is accomplished I will watch all I can of&nbsp; Queer As Folk.&nbsp; Alright I know my life has been reduced to just watching TV and waiting for the times when Kaycee And *J* come over to lighten my life. Yeah they were over yesterday and we talked about the 911 movie ( sorry I can't spell and I wasn't even gonna try so you all could see just how much I suck).   Over the past few days I have spent time chatting on Yahoo and just over all thinking about my state of events and what actually has led me up the conditon I live in. I swear if that doesn't make your head spin to sit back and think, "&nbsp; GOT DAMN IT!&nbsp; I have fucked up!"&nbsp; For me it was a truely enlightening experience.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was because I had never really thought about my hand in the parts that I would say majorly screwed it up. Only the parts where I felt&nbsp;I was trying to fix it.&nbsp; I am not saying that I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth and I traded it in for a crack pipe but you know there are other things I was born into that I guess I didn't appreciate.&nbsp; Yeah I know I should have been appreciative when I had it. Yeah I know that my life isn't as hard as I may&nbsp;think it&nbsp; is, it's just different.&nbsp; Yeah I know I should have thought about that then.   All I can say is that I hope my son, my precious raison d'etre, doesn't grow up to hate me for the choices I&nbsp;did make, have made and will make because of him. Hopefully my son will never know the drama his mom endured.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hopefully by the time he grows up to remember his childhood his father and I will either get our acts together or apart. Yeah I know I shouldn't waste my time just thinking about it.

       First and foremost I would like to say HAPPY BIRTHDAY *K*. Now that, that is out the way. I ain't got much to say cause I got the only hangover. Cause last night I was drink shooters and having Woo-woo's. Don't know what's in them but I know you will get fucked up! See and I know I ain't got no good damn sense cause I was trying to keep up with a damn Marine! This is for the folks who don't know.&nbsp; Marine's are lushes! I think they pull them aside sometime during boot camp and teach them how to hold their liquor! Almost needless to say, yours truly is not a marine.&nbsp; I don't have what it takes to be one. Not that back breaking work and soul crushing discipline would bother me, oh no. It is simply that I ask to many damn questions. Why we crawling through the mud? Why we gotta get up this damn early? Why I gotta clean this nasty ass bathroom? These cammies ride up my ass, can I get one with a roomier seat? What you mean I can't use the bathroom? I can't just clip my shit off all willy-nilly! Why ya'll locking me in the baracks with all these mad girls? Are they gonna whip my ass? Will ya'll stop them when I start to bleed?&nbsp; Ya'll see how my boot camp would go? I would be the only casualty in boot camp and that don't make no damn sense.&nbsp; But before I go I will tell ya'll this don't try to out drink a marine. Their are reasons why they are the first to go out and the last to come back. It is because they crazy!&nbsp;   I&nbsp;hope I didn't offend any of you marines who have read this but ya'll know I'm telling the damn truth!&nbsp; I'm out like a crackheads tooth!

I'm still on a mission to shave *K*'s cat Nala. Yes that will be one bald cat, cause she messing with my allergies damnit! Yes Lord there wil be a big patch of black fur in the front yard. *K*'s husband is gonna teach me how to drive stick shift today. I hope I don't burn out the clutch. Cause I don't have any money to buy it back.  This is for Kaycee. I love you and you are the closest sister I have. I din't mean to lie to you. I just never knew how to bring that up to you. I know that you would have held my hand  when I needed it most but I thought then that I could handle this problem myself. I realize now that I couldn't and didn't handle it the way it should have been handled. Butit does make me feel better to know that you still love me even though.

      um...last night i finally told my s.o. that i was raped when i was 14. i had never told anyone before not even my bestfriend ( sorry kaycee). i guess it will be easier to tell however many people read this blog than it is to tell the people closest to me, for fear that they might look at me differently. i don't know if i'll get through this blog or how long i'll even leave it up. all i do know is that it is about time i said something to someone.   i was raped my freshman year of high school during spring break. i was spending the week at my cousin *L* house. she is or was a fast ass (i haven't spoken or seen her since this happened). 3 guys came over to her house to chill for a while. she leaves with one of them. they were going to the store or whatever. she tells me she is going out for a minute. so as the other 2 guys and i are watching something on cable i thought everything was cool. when all of a sudden one of them slaps me to the floor. the other guy says something to the effect of " yeah son i was waiting on you". while on guy held me down the other raped me. they took turns. they were done by the time my cousin came back. as she walked in the door they ran out. she looks at me and starts trying to make me promise not to say anything to anyone. she runs a bath for me. i sat in that water until it went ice cold.   i never told anyone. i don't know if it was because i couldn't believe it was actually me there or whether it was my promise to her. i remember i said before that if you read my blogs you might learn something. please learn this, if you are raped or assaulted PLEASE TELL SOMEONE! don't do what i did and suffer in silence.

      I miss me phone ya'll. I really do. Um...yes I did get the caps off, and no it wasn't as simple as mashing the caps button. One more day till I am back in MD. Yeah man, not like I have a lot to do out there cause I have no idea on how to get around and the nearest metro to my cousin's house is the one in New Carrolton which just so happens to be 20 min away but um...DC is only 25 min away. So why the hell drive to take the train?   Hey ya'll remember I had puppies, well there is one that is like a damn mutant. I swear they are only like 3 weeks old and this one is the size of a 2 month old. I mean damn he's already like 6 lbs. I wonder if dogs have glandular problems. I hope not cause we ain't got no money for him he out of luck. He'll just be like Clifford out this mutha. My S.O.'s mom wants to name him Sir Boris Bonnefis of Brooklyn. Um yeah...like I said. She had another dog that was huge and that was his name so I guess she figures that he'll live again. They are just so cute right now cause they are trying to learn how to bark and growl. It is funny as hell cause they fit in the palm of my hand and I have small hands. And did I mention that they have not a tooth in they're little heads. I swear that is comedy.   I have come to the realization that I need a stress free life. I have recently started smoking and not in a social setting. And good lord, I'm smoking cancer in a green box. Yes ya'll I'm smoking Newports. I swear if stress don't kill, it will be the cigarettes. Well I gotta go now cause I ain't got no more to say.

      I know I should be doing something right now. Is it the laundry? Yes. Should I be feeding my dobies? Yes. Should I be cleaning house? YES! I really need to go up to my school cause, well I need ya'll help on this cause these people got me feeling like I can't add. I got my financial aide money in the total of $2000. My tuition is a total of $1100. Why do I have a bill of $125? How does that add up? I past the third grade. So why doesn't this math add up? I ain't supposed to get a bill. I gotta go to my school. This sux I swear. These financial aide people need to stop playing with my emotions.  I need my edjumakashun. Why me LAWRD!   I am also supposed to be taking my sister to the piercing parlor to get her triangle done. Well first we gotta see if she is built correctly for it. If not I guess she'll be getting her vch or a hch, depending on which she likes. For those of ya'll who don't know what those are go to these sites, www.tribalectic.com or www.ringsofdesire.com   Alright. My dogs just kicked in the door on some "FEED ME!!" So I guess I'll feed them so they'll stop looking at me like I'm lunch meat. Here's something for my big sis, "VERIZON". Don't ask me.

      I have spent the last 2 weeks in Severn, MD. I was at my cousin's house with her for a visit  and it was cool. I had almost no drama (ya'll miss that don't cha?) and I didn't really have to beat my son for being totally out of control. So I would have to say this was a good fortnight. I can't really say I am excited about going home or anything cause I hate to ride the bus. And Greyhound or Peter Pan will be taking me home. It is a 4 hour ride and hopefully I won't have to deal with little old ladies telling me how bad a mother I am, cause I let my son play video games at such a young age. *that note was for you, ya old bat! The one that harassed me on the bus* Last night Kaycee came over and we spent a few hours together and I finally got her to do my hair. I mean she ran off with my loc butter but hey I guess I had to pay her somehow, right. lol  Not to sound like a damn Kotex commercial, really reminded me how much time we used to spend together and how long it has been since we have been apart. I mean I have like 3 sisters of my own but she is like the sister I didn't get to grow up with. *sniffle* I will miss her when I go back home. As I type this she should be on her way to my fam's house now. *K*'s husband is supposed to teach us how to play bid whist. So that is gonna be an experience especially since we have no cards. I guess I should be out right now trying to find some, right? Naw, I think I'll be colored and wait until she gets here to look for some. Well I'll keep ya'll updated on some more of Misery's World. It's my world...hell ya'll know the rest!

      Alright I have come to realize that my service really and truly sux. Not just sux but sux hairy unwashed ass, with little used tissue crumbs. All this is because, I posted my little death threat for Kaycee yesterday and all but as she let me know it was not directly her fault. So I say sorry *K*.  I received several death threats of my own yesterday due to Cingular not having a better coverage area for me in Severn. I get one bar of service and it really blows chunks. I should be going home (back to BK) this Sat. But I shall return to MD after a few days to make sure that I have all my affairs in order for school. I be down here to help my cousin out with her college Algebra. And people said I would never have a use for it...wait I said that and technically I still ain't using it!  Oh well! I wonder how my dobie's pups are doing. Only three of her original 8 survived. I am so hurt. So now I left with 1 boy and 2 girls I think I gotta see them to make sure but when I know ya'll will. Well I gotta go. I gotta go make fun of my cousin..I would tell ya'll but she'd kill me! LAWRD that was comedy!!!

      I spent my independence Day in SC. I guess I had a good enough time but ya know how family can fuck up your shyt! I really went down there cause *Q* was having her birthday partyon the Saturday so I had to show my face. Her birthday is actually on the first on July, yes ya'll she is a welfare baby!  For those of you who know and don't act like ya don't, welfare checks usually come on the first and 15 of every month. Well haven't had much drama with my S.O.(?) lately so I don't really know anything to tell you guys. Right now I am in MD again. I kinda like the scene down here so I might consider moving here to be closer to my people and all and to get away from the expensive ass NYC life. I am supposed to go around and check out the employment prospects down here. ***NEWS FLASH*** My big sister *R* has told me that I can go to Geico and try to get a  job because they told her that she has a second interview. And they pay you for training an all. I am like so there. Cause I can always move after I have the job. Everyone needs car insurance so hey! I would talk more but my damn Allergies are kicking my ass! I swear I am so gonna shave *K*'s cat Nala! I personally think that she'll look cute bald! I really should look up if that is animal cruelty. Oh well I'll let ya'll know how my life progresses in....MISERY'S WORLD!!  It is my world and most of ya'll are just making me miserable!

      I'm feeling some what blue today. As ya'll all know, I am currently in MD for a spell. Last night I called my S.O. and told him that I missed him and that I loved him. The first thing he said to me was "Yeah I bet!"  Yeah that's what I said! So I asked him what was wrong with him and does he have a problem. He goes into this whole thing of " I bet you don't tell all the people you talk to on the phone that you love me and all that!" So I said to him well you don't know that. I mean everyone who knows me knows that I love him with all my heart. I've know him for the past...damn 10 years. And I've loved him even when I was with an ex of mine who I regret even meeting because he is (my ex) like the pimple you get in your pubic hair line. You hate to see them there so you are tempted to squeeze it but now it hurts and you now have a scar.   My thing is he can't say that because everyone I know. knows how I feel about him. But he can't and couldn't say the same. And for him to even bring that up when his shit isn't in order hurt me so damn deep. I am starting to think that the relationship that I had/have with him has run its course. I don't want to leave him or him to leave me because I know that I'll cry and throw tantrums to get him to stay but if he doesn't want to be here with me then I think he should go. I mean I'm not in the habit of keeping a man that doesn't want to be kept.   He and I have had our share of problems but lately it seems that there are only more problems than any good. Maybe that is because we are going through this hard time right now. Maybe I just need to live and let go. I have been thinking about moving out of NYC for a while now. Maybe this is the time for me to do it. I think I should just look for work while I'm down here and see how I can make it out here. I'm nervous about doing that though because it isn't just me that I would be moving but my son as well. By myself I wouldn't care where I lived or anything but with a child I have to consider that. But I guess if I am determined enough I can make it happen with or without help. I know that kaycee would help me but she can only help me but so far ya know.  It is funny how when you are pregnant and people make promises, you actually think that they are gonna keep them. It is even funnier when even thought they haven't proved themselves you try to hold on hoping that they will change and do what's right.   And if my S.O. finds this blog or has found this blog....Boo-boo, I love you. I always have and I always will. No one can change my feelings for you, except you!

      As a child of the '80's, I think I remember the Brat Pack very well. I was watching the VH1 Fabulous Life of... And they said that Demi Moore was a part of the Brat Pack. THEY LIE!! She was not a part of them. The totally left out both Corey's ( Haim and Feldman). They did include Molly Ringwald, Alley Sheedy, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson ( I still think he is the sexiest man a-fucking-live), &amp; Andrew McCartney. Where the hell did Demi Moore come from? I think they just wanted to include her because she came out with a movie more recently than the rest or maybe because she dated Emilio Estevez for a time. But still I mean if they wanted to include damn Keifer Sutherland ( I love his name...it is so easy to say...kee-fur), I would understand why. But fucking Demi Moore? Please...that heifer wasn't in enough high rated movies then. I know cause I have seen just about every damn Brat Pack movie. They can't fool me, DAMMIT!! The real fans will not be fooled nor denied!! Tell the TRUTH! Thank you this has been my first psa.

      Hey ya'll back to Misery's world-o-drama. I have to find a new pace to live. No...yours truly is not being put out of her home exactly. We need to move. But I have a good window to move. I have to be out of here by Feb. Now I wanna stay in BK for at the very least till the end of my first year back in school. Hell they made me beg and plead to get back in. I wanna just do one year and then I can transfer where ever else if need be. I mean if push comes to shove we can stay in my son's aunt's house in NJ. BUT truth be told I don't want to. First of all she's slack. Yes kiddies, "slack" is not just a word meaning pants. She'll cook but not wash the damn dishes. And then if dishes weren't "magically" washed behind her she'll cook again but over the dirty dishes. Not only that but she leave her worn draws on the bathroom floor. I can't do it man. Let me be frank...my son's father has never seen my dirty draws on the floor. He has seen them washed in the laundry, drying on the bathroom shower rod, and hell he has even washed a pair of mine for me (note: he doesn't know this but they weren't really dirty. they just fell on the floor and I wasn't putting them back on my ass until they were clean). And did I mention that as big a buffalo heifa she is, she cooks like she is feeding a 3 year old. When she cooks for a house full of people now ( there are 7 of us. 3 kids and 4 adults), this woman will make 3 pork chops, a cup of rice and one can of veggies. Who the hell is that feeding?? First of all *E* can eat 2 large pizzas by himself and my son can eat 4 slices. I see it as she ain't cooking for me. Damnit cause I done starve to death waiting on her food. But what kills me is she complains about her being so over weight. I'm like, look if you would eat to get full and not just to knock the hungry pains off. You won't eat so damn often during the damn day. Now me, I may eat like twice a day with a snack. But um..naw her and her buffalo children eat all damn day if you let them. Yes I call them buffalo children cause they are. Her son *E* is 9 years old and weighs 130lbs. I didn't weigh that much until I was pregnant. What the hell? And her daughter *K* is 4 and she already wears a size 8 and 9. Now for people who don't have children, this is not right. At her age she should be wearing a 4T or maybe even a 5. But not damn twice her usual size. And then they got the nerve to be talking about how my son is scrawny and hungry. No bitch, my son is healthy. He wears his correct size. He is just active as hell and won't sit still. I guess he figures that if he does sit down he'll fall asleep. But back to my problems at hand. I need a place to live. I don't want to live with the slack buffalo. Someone help me. If you see a listing in the NYC area email me or atleast leave a comment on where I can find it. I'll be looking too, but you know the more eyes I have, the more I'll see. As far as the Gov. of NJ. Man they would have had to drag me out of office with a dick in my mouth and ass. I feel that one has nothing to do with the other. His job was fine, I guess. I have enough problems trying to keep up with the hating of my own Gov. I mean who he does on the side does not directly affect the role he has in office. Come on now, we all know that all these politicians have women ( and some have men) on the side while taking pictures in the public with their "trophy" wives. Who ever doesn't admit to this is damn stupid. Same thing with the Clinton. Man, the should be happy I ain't Pres. cause their would be a long as line of men and women (yeah I just outted myself *blush*) in front of the White House with tired ass tongues. Cause I would be getting head on the hour. I feel if it keep the person in charge mellow. I am all for it. Now to me the real problem is in Cali. What is going on there? Why is it all those gays and lesbians who were "legally" married are now having their marriages annulled. I think it is wrong to do that. I feel personally gays should be able to suffer right along side str8 folks. But seriously. I think that if people want to be married then let them. There are bigger fish to fry then worrying whether Tom and Dan want to be together for the rest of their lives. Not to mention that this is hypocrisy. Fucking Brittany Spears can get married as a joke but not Sharon and Melissa? Why cause someone says that their love isn't right and therefore not valid. PLEASE GET A GRIP!

       The Dante's Inferno Test has sent you to  Purgatory!   Here is how you matched up against all the levels:      Level    Score       Purgatory   (Repenting Believers)   High       Level 1 - Limbo   (Virtuous Non-Believers)   Moderate       Level 2   (Lustful)   High       Level 3   (Gluttonous)   Moderate       Level 4   (Prodigal and Avaricious)   Very Low       Level 5   (Wrathful and Gloomy)   Very Low       Level 6 - The City of Dis   (Heretics)   Very Low       Level 7   (Violent)   High       Level 8- the Malebolge   (Fraudulent, Malicious, Panderers)   Moderate       Level 9 - Cocytus   (Treacherous)   Low       Take the  urlLink Dante's" Divine Comedy Inferno Test    Your fate has been decided.... You are one of the lucky ones! Because of your virtue and beliefs, you have escaped eternal punishment. You are sent to Purgatory!   Purgatory You have escaped damnation and made it to Purgatory, a place where the dew of repentance washes off the stain of sin and girds the spirit with humility. Through contrition, confession, and satisfaction by works of righteousness, you must make your way up the mountain. As the sins are cleansed from your soul, you will be illuminated by the Sun of Divine Grace, and you will join other souls, smiling and happy, upon the summit of this mountain. Before long you will know the joys of Paradise as you ascend to the ethereal realm of Heaven.     Wow. I got into purgatory, probably but the skin of my bloody teeth. *doing tha happy dance* Oh shit, isn't this pride??!! Damnit I just slid down to some level. That sucks. Crap.  Why do I have to start of my damn morning with drama? Yesterday, the kids came to my house during camp hours cause it was raining. *S* (from the onion soup oxtails fame) calls and tell me that her kids raincoats are in her room. I tell her that the kids where already here so I didn't need them. Thus I did not touch them. This morning she tells her son *E* to go get them. He didn't look for them and just tells her that he didn't find them. *S* get an attitude, kisses her teeth and says " Go and  tell  *A* to give them to you". So I said "Don't  ask  *A*. I did not use them yesterday, remember". So she gets all huffy and says " well I  did  call  you  yesterday and tell you where they were" so I told her " And I didn't touch them". The fucking buffalo heifa comes plodding down the stairs at a break neck speed like she wanted something and says " You know what *A* you can go ahead. I'll take my own kids to the park". The fucking fool! Like that shit was and would hurt my damn feelings. Who the hell wants to walk with her damn kids when they are always ashy as hell and look a clean mess. OH HELL NAW! Not I said the little white mouse. What bothers me is that the people in this house have taken for granted that I try to avoid drama. And thus I hold my tongue on a lot. However, they don't realize that I have "multiple personalities" and the BITCH in me is clawing her way out of my damn throat. When she pops out cause they came off wrong, they are shocked and appalled that my mouth is so got damned harsh. Well you know what I have put up with a lot since my son was born and I had to put the bitch in me down for awhile. And you know what the BITCH is back and she's mad as fuck. Please know that I have a short leash on my BITCH and will only attack if you walk, run or trip into her biting zone. Be fucking forewarned,    THE BITCH IS FUCKING BACK!!!

      A GUIDE TO THE LANGUAGE OF CHILDREN  When They Say... They Mean...   My head hurts. I don't want to do whatever you are about to ask me to do.  I can't eat this-it tastes funny. I am aware of the concern you and Dad have about the freshness of food, and in an attempt to get something to eat that more suits my taste, like Raviolios, I am implying that this dish is spoiled.  It wasn't me. It was me.  Can I have a drink of water? Can I stay up four more minutes?  Can I go to the bathroom? Can I stay up four more minutes?  I think I'm going to throw up. Can I stay up all night?  I can't breathe! I am merely trying to divert your attention away from this discussion of my misdeeds by the most direct and immediate method available to me.  Just one second. Just give me twenty minutes.  How come? I'm just stalling.  Do I have to? Stalling again.  Why right now? Why not later when you'll have forgotten all about it and I won't have to do it?  I'll be good and clean up my room every single day! Promises, promises, promises. Once you do this for me, I don't care what happens. My word isn't worth a dime.  My teacher hates me. Boy, am I doing lousy in school!  I'm always the one who has to do it! I'm always the one who puts up the big fuss, which is why I'm always the one who gets out of having to do it.  I love you. I want something very badly.  I hate you. I hate you.    I thought this was comedy. Although I have yet to hear all of these. I am quiet sure I will. Children have that uncanny knack of telling you what they think you really want to hear. I guess it is because they have known you all their lives. My son has known me all of his almost 4 and 1/2 years (like duh right! lls) and he plays me like a harp. He gets me to do things I normally wouldn't do, like let his little snot-nosed friends come over and I actually promise to their respective parents to feed them and keep them for the day. This si something I will never again do. People learn from my example...if 4 parents ask you to keep 10 kids for a day, say HELL NAW! I mean it or you will feel worn down and just mentally (and possibly physically) abused. Love kids like I do but I prefer them when they leave. Towards the end of the day I was so ready to just give mine to the parents who picked up their kid last. Kinda like a freebie. But his (my son's) dad would have killed me and hunted them down like those "hulk-i-sized" dogs on the Hulk. Yeah I know, but I had to put something on for the little crumb-snatchers. I would talk more but I still have not recovered from yesterday's events...where's my codeine for this damn migraine?

        -Perfect- You're the perfect girlfriend. Which means you're rare or that you cheated :P You're the kind of chick that can hang out with your boyfriend's friends and be silly. You don't care about presents or about going to fancy placed. Hell, just hang out. You're just happy being around your boyfriend.   urlLink  What Kind of Girlfriend Are You?    brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Well what do you know. I am the perfect girl friend. Who would have guessed it. Certainly not the complete unwashed lint covered assholes that I used to date. Right now I am on a complete male hating thing. Sometimes I just wake up like that. But today is not one of those days. This morning while taking my son to camp. This knuckle dragging male decides he wants to help himself to a great big heaping handful of my ass. No there was no sign on my back that said free grabs *I know because I checked*. So why did this throw back from the fucking Precambrian age touch me? Well the world will never know. All I know is it is times like this that I wish I remembered that damn " Yank, twist, pull" move that a marine I know taught me. Maybe I can get Kaycee to show me. Cause he know he need his ass beat! And if I had something heavy enough in my hand, I would be in jail right now. I don't know why some men don't think before they put their hands on women. Not for the simple fact that one day they gonna grab the wrong fucking women and she is gonna do 25 to life but because these same men, might have daughters, sisters, nieces, or cousins. But more importantly they have a mother. And they wouldn't want their own mother disrespected. It just ain't right. I fit all of these bills and this fucking bastid who's mother should have swallowed, felt the need to touch me, without invitation. Don't I count? I am someone's mother, daughter, sister, niece and cousin. Yet I guess he felt that since I was none of these things to him, my feelings were up for debate. To the guy who grabbed me, know this, feel safe in the knowledge that all the grimy dudes that I know are in jail or hiding. Feel very safe. But that doesn't mean that I don't have a good memory. And they will get out, sooner than you think. Now back to the sons of bitches that I wasted good coochie juice on. YOU ALL CAN KICK ROCKS! You were a waste of time. Go fuck yourselves like shown in this pic. urlLink http://www.bangedup.com/post.php?media=486 . May your dick shrivel and burn like seen here  urlLink http://www.bangedup.com/post.php?media=424 . I hate you all DIE!! Did I mention DIE!! Ahem tomorrow we will be back to my none violent self. Thank you for your support.

      Well three of my friends were in a bit a problem, over something completely not necessary. And being that I had nothing to do with any one this directly, all I could do was sit back and watch the fireworks. As an outsider here I can give the following advice. To Thumper, yeah you do need a hug! And I will give it to you when we see each other. I notice how ever you didn't fight off the kiss. *winks*      To *J*, relax man. I have just about known of all the men Kaycee has been with, and those she hasn't. She does love you. You probably will never know how she sounded when she first described your relationship to me. That was the happiest she has been since we left Tech. She sounded like a little school girl and if you know her then you will know that she absolutely abhors anything that might make her seem *girlie*. And around you she is. Now to Kaycee, girl if these people give you an ulcer or anymore stress, then I am going to war!!! Now it may seem as if I am not gonna be hard on you but I have no reason to be. We have damn near shared a brain since we met so just about everything you do I know and understand why. Very damn rarely do we have dissenting in the ranks. So we seeing eye to eye. Just remember this one thing that got me through most of my probs..." Nothing lasts forever". Now that we have all gotten that out of the way. I have my own drama to start. Ahem.....I have been noticing that both Kaycee and *J* blogging about someone that we all know. Yes you know I am talking about you *X*, don't act like you ain't reading this!! NOW you know who this is cause, I said you do!! But if yo slow acting TECH Graduate self need a damn hint! Then here it is......I am the only female to slap the holy shit out of you and you not fuck her up! Yes, you know "The Slap Heard 'Round The Classroom". Mr. Curley's class....sitting in front of you with that boy Chin ( don't ask he's black) reading my book and writing on my leg. Yeah punk it is me!! Why the hell you dodging me like I got you on child support? Boy ease up, *A* ain't yours. *thinking atleast I don't think he is* Naw let me stop before people think I'm out there like that. I know who my baby's daddy is! *X* I swear you know you ain't right. Cause you can call *J* and Kaycee but you act like I still got third grade cooties. Man come on " circle, circle, dot, dot. now I got my cootie shot" What's good now? If I hear you can call other folk and not me...we fighting. And not in the good way I'm talking bout fighting like the way me and *P* beat up that old dude across the street for wetting us up with the hose. Yeah I can say it now cause the case was dropped. But enough. I gotta get off this damn comp cause I gotta go and cook and I got a damn migraine feeling like that gotdamn Lord of the Dance muthafukka is just a prancin his sweet ass around in my head.

      Well I have been home since early Monday morning. And lord the sight my eyes beheld when I arrived home. I know I left this house clean when I left. Why is it not when I get back. Let us just stop here before I wanna burn the house down and start over. And I hear arson charges stick! The puppy Boris is getting huge. I mean damn he is the size of a 2 and 1/2 month old pup. The other 2 pups died. They weren't getting big enough fast enough, to keep up. I fell so bad that they died. I missed my son so much while I was gone. I didn't even realize how much until I got home and saw him sleeping in my bed, drooling on my pillow. I wish he wasn't doing that but I guess you gotta take what your kid gives ya. My baby sister's birthday is tomorrow. I know she thinks I don't remember but I do. The day she way born was one of the most important days of my life. I finally was a big sister! I wanted a baby brother but she's just as good if not better. Maybe I should stop telling her that story of how we found her on a door step. I know ya'll are all wondering "What's the story?" Like to hear it? Here it goes! One beautiful Sunday morning my grandmother was getting ready for church and noticed that she didn't have any pantyhose. She tried to send my aunts and uncles but none of them would go, my mother finally told her that she would go. As my mother was stepping out the door she noticed a small little girl in a black plastic bag on the top step. We don't know how old she was so we just told her that the day we found her is her birthday. Now I know some of ya'll are going that just ain't right. But if you notice I never told her she was adopted!! Only that we found her. I can't be that wrong cause my family never disagrees with me, they only laugh when she tries to ask them if this is true! So who is truly wrong here? Don't think that she is alone. I tell my baby brother that he's really a monkey we found to replace the brother that my older brother, sister and myself ate cause he kept crying and got on our nerves. We tell him that we shaved him and cut off his tail before our parents got home and could beat us. Hey some of ya'll are most likely shaking your heads in disbelief but hey it is true. Ya'll can't look down on me cause either ya'll told your younger siblings something similar or you were the sibling that was told these stories. I don't see this as sibling abuse, I see it as giving them character! Like if your own siblings would tell you things that will make you cry, what do you think the world will do to you. I mean I didn't start telling them these things until they were like um....7 or 8. And I didn't start adding little extras until they were old enough to handle it. Well if ya'll will excuse me, I have to think of a new twist on the story to tell her tomorrow. I mean after all she is gonna be 14. And what better present can an evil big sister tell her favorite little sister than tears!! If ya'll have any new twists I can add to the story feel free to leave me a comment.
