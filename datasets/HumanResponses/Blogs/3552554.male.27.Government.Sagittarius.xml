       urlLink    This is Greenland from the plane on the ride back.  I was hoping to get a view of Greenland and I couldn't have asked for too much better than this.

       urlLink    Chris took this picture of a cathedral in Warwick through a hole in the walls of the castle in the same town.  It appears to be one of the original holes they used to shoot arrows through against enemies.

       urlLink    I thought this turned out to be a good picture.  Dusk came early in late November so we didn't get a chance to see as much in the daylight.

       urlLink    Grandma didn't like this picture, but I'm posting it anyway.  She does portray the look of a common English lady, I think, with her facial expression and bonnet-like hair cover.

       urlLink    My cousin Andy and Grandma Marjorie making their way to the train.  This was after an eventful rush through London's tube network getting my elderly grandmother onto and off of the lengthy escalators.

       urlLink    The Lyceum Theatre where we saw the broadway show The Lion King (not to hard to figure out).  The exterior is more impressive than the interior.

       urlLink    This is a picture of one of the train stations in London.  It is on the north side of the city and although I don't remember for sure, I think the station is called King's Crossing.

       urlLink    I thought I'd get a picture of the contrast between the Galveston bay water (brown) and the Gulf of Mexico water (blue-green).  It gets even bluer as one gets further out on the sea.

       urlLink    The bow of the ship with a worker playing guitar as the ship makes its way out into the Gulf of Mexico.  The wind was unbelievable and the fact that I got a steady shot with the camera is even more unbelievable.

      I've streamlined my work process a little more today by reserving space on my desk for daily tasks and current tasks.  It seems as though having my taskings in front of me makes a big difference in my ability to focus on the matter at hand.

       urlLink Yahoo! News - BOYCOTT THE MILITARY   As a member of the armed forces (Air Force), I have to agree and disagree w/ Ted Rall's comments.  True, the military doesn't hold as much honor as it did in WWII when it was fighting back the axis powers from their attempts to conquer the world, but it does present a very good alternate opportunity to many in this country.  My four yrs. of active duty bought me a bachelor's degree at a state-funded university along w/ room and board in Illinois (where the veteran's benefits provide free tuition at state schools).  The military is also one of the better options to provide structure and discipline to many whose lives have been consumed by drugs or poor upbringings.  I personally would like to see an expansion of other volunteer services where these low-income kids (myself being one) can be taught valuable skills and services.  The military just forces too many to compromise their convictions for an organization that flexes the U.S. government's illegit muscle all over the world.

      The threat and danger is terrorism, but an even greater threat and danger is many people's view of why terrorists want to attack us.  Much has been written on this subject, but I'll try to offer a new perspective that I don't think has been touched on very much - certainly not in the mainstream media.   First of all, many people like to form opinions on world events without knowing the whole story - How can you know the whole story when the media is going to filter out anything that's not going to be entertaining or capture interest?  The whole story might include a child who got wounded in Iraq, but was on his way to thank American soldiers  for the   good  things they've done over there.   Secondly, many people tend to rally around whatever is most acceptable or whatever boosts their pride...and pride, ah that dangerous trait that blinds us from the truth to boost self-interest.  I've read in many places where  the author writes that we've been attacked because the terrorists are jealous of our success, our liberty, our position, and so on.  And many people, dare I say the majority of people, feel the same way.  Where do they get this from?  Is it written in the Al-Qaeda vision statement that "America will die because they have been successful and have more liberties than we do?"  I think the reason they hate us might have more to do with how we've aided Israel militarily, how we've come into the Arabian peninsula to ensure our self-interests (there's that compound word again)  aren't harmed, or how the CIA has recklessly gotten their hands in numerous government operations that favors our self-interest (there it is again, what is it about that word).  It seems that interest in ourselves has left some middle-easterners angry because our self-interest is encroaching on their collective best interests.   After saying all of that, I can conclude by safely saying that I am more frightened of many people's views on  why  terrorists attacked us rather than the actual terrorists themselves.  Until these people can change their veiws and politicians and government can change their same view, we're going to be in trouble for a long time.
