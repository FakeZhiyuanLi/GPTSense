      ... And I'm horrified. But heck, it might be fun. And I should have a blog. No. Scratch that. I DESERVE a blog. I mean, I write professionally for a living. I'm a newspaper columnist (sort of). You can read me once a month in  urlLink The Bakersfield Californian  daily newspaper. (And once a week in a not-so-secret column that runs without my name on it).  I'm also a cartoonist. An aspiring novelist. A poet. A lounge singer (although currently I am without a band or a lounge). And a lover of all things sweet and sugary.  I'm also a woman AND African American. But I come in peace ...  This blog is for anyone who is nosey about my life as an entertainment reporter. That includes ex-boyfriends I don't talk to anymore. Women I'm no longer friends with and my mother in the big STL.  Forwarning for the fragile: I have the tendency to curse from time to time, heck, I can even be vulgar, but I promise to keep it at a managable level. I won't be flippin'  urlLink Dick Cheneys  all over the place.  Until then ...

      Totally in love with comic  urlLink K.T. Tatara . Saw him at the  urlLink Joker's Wild Comedy Club's  premiere July 3 on Saturday night. He was HILARIOUS. He opened for comic Quevaughn (Keith) Bryant, who runs the club with his wife. Keith had me laughing so hard that I'm still seeing a doctor about it. Loved his bit on "Beltman" -- the superhero who pulls up the pants of teenage boys and supplies them with much needed belts.  The jokes go on again this Saturday at the Jungle Cafe inside the Best Western Hill House, 700 Truxtun Ave. Shows at 8 p.m. and 10:15 p.m. Tip: Make reservations. You don't want to get stuck behind a pole.

      News, gossip and stuff to do ... all this week in Bakersfield  * Local band  urlLink Printed In Slovenia  is now going by the name "Loveday." Guitarist Ben Gomez is no longer with the band and has been replaced by 21-year-old Matt Melton who last played with local band Bessemer Process.  *  urlLink Slim the Drifter  has a new band ... The Slim the Drifter Band. They'll be playing Dagny's next week. Details on the show are forthcoming ...  *  urlLink Eve Ensler  shut down Ashley Bretz's production of " urlLink The Vagina Monologues " in LA. The show was a hit for The Empty Space earlier this year. Bretz took a lot of risks with Ensler's signature work, adding  urlLink Bob Fosse -style dancing, more women and a "Cabaret" atmosphere. Bretz said she'd been going back and forth with Ensler's people for weeks. They wanted Bretz to stick with the "no more than three women on stage at once" and "no multimedia" clauses. Bretz said she got the OK, but after a benefit show where she invited out all the Hollywood types she was told to shut it down or get sued. More on this later ...  * You got two more weeks to see " urlLink Hatikvah " in Los Angeles. That's Hal Friedman's play. My predecessor Chris Page gave it good reviews and they've gotten both yeas and nays in the LA press.  * "A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum" will open July 23 at  urlLink Starts Theatre Restaurant .  *  urlLink The Spotlight Theatre's  latest production "Ziggurat" is without a director. Word on the street is that he had to split due to personal issues. The assistant director will be picking up the slack. The Iraqi conflict-based play, penned by Friedman, is slated to open July 23.  * LA-based band  urlLink Hoobastank's  sleep-eyed lead singer Doug Robb has a crush on Penelope Cruz. Nothing serious. He just likes to tell interviewers that, but I'm almost positive he has a woman. Robb and the rest of Hooba will be in town Thursday, July 15 at  urlLink Stramler Park . You can read about him and my interview with  urlLink Phantom Planet  in Wednesday's Eye section of  urlLink The Bakersfield Californian .  *  urlLink Monty Byrom  and  urlLink Mother Funk Conspiracy  are doing regular gigs now at Fishlips. Friday nights. Show starts at 9 p.m.  * Local purse/clothing designer  urlLink Misa Misono's  got hot summer stuff on her website. Go buy something.  * Every Friday night from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., fashion show at  urlLink The Bistro  off California Ave. Food and drink specials. Pretty girls in nice clothes. Jazz music.  * In case you didn't notice, Bar Flies (next door to Downtown Records) is closed and no more, but word on the street is Shamiqster, Radio Shack Rahim (that's Beaux Mingus), is buying the space and turning it into a thrift shop.  * Local band  urlLink Near Miss Mallet  is having their CD release party July 17 at Borders. Chris Page used to be the bass player before he ran away to Arizona to do theatre reviews.   That's all for now! Have a good weekend!

      Going to see "Cabaret" tonight at  urlLink The Empty Space . I'm hoping it'll be fun. I mean, how often is "Cabaret" going to show up in town? Like never.   I'm bringing my sister the theater major along and a co-worker. Beforehand Bob Kempf at the Space emailed me to let me know that they've finally got new chairs. Praise the Lord. I thought they were trying to kill me, running neck and neck with The Spotlight for worst chairs. I'm glad that I'm judging the performances and not the seating otherwise I'd never have a nice thing to say. A matter of fact all the theaters in this town have awful chairs with the exception of ... goodness. Stars maybe?  Anyway, here's what Bob had to say about those chairs:  "After 18 months of almost torturing our tolerant audience members, those horrid brown chairs are out of here! They have been replaced by chairs that are roomy, comfy, and with excellent lumbar support. The chairs were generously donated to the Empty Space by Bakersfield's local State Farm Insurance Offices at 900 Old River Road."  Anyway. Here's an awful chair ranking (not including the Space's new chairs. They might leave the list all together after tonight):  5. The Harvey Auditorium: Just like high school, now with spinal injuries.  4. Stars Theatre Restaurant/Candlelight Dinner Theatre: At least you have a table there to lean on.  3. Bakersfield Community Theatre: Number of times I've bruised a knee in their theater due to the chairs — 3  2. The Spotlight Theatre: After nearly three hours of watching their production of "On the Verge" I couldn't tell which I disliked more, the word-heavy dialog or the chair. Hmmm. I think it was the chair.  And lastly ...  1. The Empty Space's Brown Back Breakers: The staple of cheap wedding receptions and out-of-town hotel conferences, these chairs were only meant brief, brief, brief moments of sitting. Not sitting through "Julius Caesar." Good riddance, you bastions of evil.  I mean, if you have bad chairs, people are more likely to stay awake and watch your performance, but then, they're also more likely to walk out after 15 minutes, so hooray for new chairs!

      Check out Friday's  urlLink Eye on Entertainment  where I got to kick it with "The Shoopster" Bakersfield's  urlLink 29 Eyewitness News  Anchor Rusty Shoop.   Rusty was a good sport for the feature I did on news anchors in light of our " urlLink Anchorman: the Legend of Ron Burgundy " movie coverage. Although I give The Shoopster the Ron Burgundy treatment in the piece, the guy who actually kept telling me over and over again that he was the resident "Ron Burgundy" at KBAK was the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. news anchor Kurt Rivera. We had a great little moment involving him forgetting his make up for the 6 p.m. broadcast with Lynda Halligan.  Here's what got cut from the piece:  During a commercial break, news anchor Kurt Rivera keeps referring to himself as “Ron Burgundy.”  He asks a co-worker to get a bottle out and fill it with water.  “The one in my black bag,” he says, the same bag he tossed open earlier frantically to get out his makeup before rushing onto KBAK’s 29 Eyewitness News set next to his co-anchor Lynda Halligan.  “As Ron Burgundy I have the authority to direct people,” he jokes, before adding that he would never order anyone around.   “It doesn’t fly now,” he says wistfully smiling, “but back in the day!” Rivera is laughing now, but he'd just barely adverted a crisis.  It was almost 15 minutes to air time and the anchorman was in the newsroom, but his makeup was not.  For most men, this would not be an issue, as most men don’t have makeup kits. But then most men don’t have to anchor the 6 and 11 p.m. broadcasts.  It’s the high definition broadcast that concerns 39-year-old Rivera the most. Ever since the station switched over to broadcasting in high-definition TV he’s had to make sure that he’s made up and ready to go every time.  Though his olive skin is actually quite lovely, lightly freckled and smooth in person, the camera will find every pore, every freckle, every line and turn his angular face into a sharply detailed topography map.  He’s got to have his makeup and the clock is winding down.  “He made it,” Rivera shouts while in a mad dash back to his desk, bag in one hand, script in the other. Two pages of it go flying. He quickly dumps out his foundation, make-up sponge and brush on the floor.  In a flash he is sitting next to Halligan, slapping on his make-up, just barely beating the clock.  “My wife always nags me. She can tell when I didn’t have time to put my makeup on. She’s my makeup critic,” said Rivera after the broadcast. “But the mirrors are so small. It’s all dusty and stuff. I probably could do a better job putting it on. You don’t grow up learning how to do makeup when you’re a guy.”  Rivera then smiled and said gruffly, “I’m a man’s man.”  Bonus: In further evidence of that whole six degrees of seperation thing. Lynda Halligan (back in her entertainment industry days) came THIS CLOSE to being a stand-in for "Anchorman" star Christina Applegate when the actress was on Fox's "Married With Children." She lost the job to a chick who looked just like her.

      Today I just realized that someone swiped out my desk chair and replaced it with a medieval (sic) torture device, a lopsided nightmare that was almost identical to my former chair. Now I'm in this stumpy blue contraption, but at least I'm not going to develop that hunchback. I'll be so happy when we move back to our remodeled newsroom. They say the chairs will be magical there. I look forward to that day.

      As some of you may be well aware, I am the middle child of two sisters, neither are internet nerds. For them, cyberspace is this thing where you order cheap plane tickets, e-mail people and play solitaire.   Deidre, my younger sister, is much more internet savvy as at least she's got her own thing going on at Blackplanet.com and used to be an avid chat room chatter before she got bored of the whole thing.But my big sis Denise, despite her engineering creditials, is all "Commodore 64" when it comes to the internet.  Peep her following email to me over "Danielle Belton Online."  Denise: "I saw your webpage...are you the only one that posts anything on it??? And what is a BLOG?? Or is it just the name of the domain that holds your web site?  It is such a pink website. I didn't know you really like pink. You know I would have picked a different color. But it was cool....I think is it is...as in Daddy's word....neat!  How long did it take for you to set it up?  I am SOOO web illiterate."  I shot her back an email and got her hip to the game. Now she's all chilly on the subject.

      It's inevitable. All the Eye Street and newsroom reporters have to take turns working the weekend reporting shifts (for that news that takes place Saturday thru Sunday.) It's unpleasant, but someone has to do it. This Saturday morning is my Saturday morning to bite the bullet and suffer through, hoping that nothing burns down, no one drowns and no one gets shot on my watch because, Lord knows, I don't want to write about it.   Although I enjoy covering breaking news from time-to-time I could never be a full-on police reporter. (Although I enjoy being friends with the police reporter — they always have the BEST stories.) But writing about car accidents and crimes get depressing. Next thing you know you're having anxiety attacks every time you drive on the highway and you've got 15 locks on your door. Of course, I'm only speaking for myself, but crime reporting makes me want to scream at people. Scream things like "STOP BEATING YOUR KIDS!" and "PUT ON YOUR FRICKIN' SEAT BELT!" Or "PUT DOWN THAT CRACK PIPE!"  But alas, you can't make people stop injuring themselves and others

       urlLink      From my comic strip, "Nerd Girl." A comic about my alter-ego Maddie, her best friend and my other alter-ego Rebecca (left) and their friends, ex-boyfriends, co-workers&nbsp;and families.&nbsp;This panel features my oldest character, Jenitta Brown&nbsp;(right).  &nbsp;  I created Jenitta when I was in high school. She's the quintessential hot black girl with a nasty attitude. She tells it like it  T-I-IS , while still being intelligent and sophisticated (somewhat.)&nbsp;Back in the day, Jenitta used to be obsessed with her ex-boyfriend, the star of my high school comic strip " urlLink Hazelwood Central ," DeVante Jones. Now she's the know-it-all roommate of Maddie. Maybe I'll post some of my old high school strips (they're easier to scan in than the new ones which are huge. But I'm saving up to buy a new computer to strickly handle my illustrating work.&nbsp; urlLink

      * Disney's " urlLink Beauty and the Beast -- the musical " is coming to Bakersfield.  urlLink Bakersfield Music Theatre  has got the rights to perform this version of the classic fairytale this fall. It'll be playing at the Harvey Auditorium in October. " urlLink Angels in America " is also coming to Bakersfield too. The controversial, avant garde drama will be playing  urlLink The Empty Space  with Hal Friedman directing. Read about this and all the shows coming to town this fall in next Friday's Eye on Entertainment inside   urlLink The Californian  .  &nbsp;  * Purple Rain!  Puuuuuurple Rain!   urlLink Prince  is coming to the Save Mart Center in Fresno, CA Sept. 4. Tickets go on sale tomorrow at 10 a.m. Check with the  urlLink Ticketmaster . Of course, I'm a member of Prince's NPG Music Club, so I ordered my tickets through his website this morning, but hey, it's only a little over $20 to join and you get all the whacky Prince action you want. It's the only way for a complete Prince freak like me to live. &nbsp; * urlLink  Streetrock  is coming to the  urlLink Kern County Fairgrounds  next weekend. That's right. That's break dancing, DJ wars, turntablists, B-boys n' girls, MC's, dance crews, hip hop,  you don't stop.  Action goes down on Saturday, July 24. Doors open at 6 p.m. The event features $300 cash prizes and is being put on by the same people who hosted Visalia's Streetrock competition last year. (Which BTW had the world's coolest flyer -- a pic of a bunch of old Star Wars toys standing around in a circle watching a toy breakdance. Once I scan it in, I'll post it on this page.) It's $5 to get in. Call (661) 869-1508 for more info. &nbsp; * Wanna do something this weekend?  urlLink Lanny Ray and the Reels  are playing Fishlips Saturday night. Comedy at  urlLink Joker's Wild Comedy Club  inside the Best Western Hill House on Saturday as well. &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      At home Blogspot looks perfect on my PC but at work, on my iMac, it looks like crap. I wonder how I can fix that? Of course, I'm not going to open this sucker up with Netscape. My iMac hates Netscape, although I'm almost positive this would work better in a Netscape browser. Oh, well. The mysteries of Bill Gates' Internet Explorer and Steve Jobs' Apple confound me again. It's like the  urlLink Bobby and Whitney  of computer programming.

      vespertine:&nbsp; adj.  1. Of, relating to, or occurring in the evening. 2. Botany Opening or blooming in the evening. 3. Zoology Becoming active in the evening, as bats and owls; crepuscular.   I was looking for the right word to describe  urlLink Cyndi Lauper's  midnight meditation on "The Great American Songbook," AKA her lastest album "At Last," which has an almost etherial quality to it. (But the Lauper is an 'etherial quality' herself.)   Then the word "vespertine" popped in my head for no apparent reason. Other than knowing it was the title of a  urlLink Bjork  album, I decided to look the word up and learned that it was more than apt to describing Lauper's blosoming evening vocals.   BTW: Hands down, Cyndi Lauper is the coolest person I've had a phone chat with. She's right up there with Merle Haggard and Dave Attel, as my two coolest interviews.

      Saw  urlLink The Empty Space's  latest " urlLink Cabaret " this weekend. Interesting show. Really makes me wonder what The Empty Space could do if they just had more ... space. I just knew someone was going to catch a three-inch heel upside the head during the high-energy dance routines. Doug Cheesman (SubUrbia, A Few Good Men) plays the Emcee and he's amazing as usual. I've never seen him have an off night. He always seems to fully commit himself to his roles with abandon. It's really refreshing.   Check  urlLink The Bakersfield Californian's  Eye on Entertainment this Friday for my full review.   Oh, and the new seats, better. But I still crave a place that will someday invest in a chair with a higher back. Perhaps someone will someday donate goo-gobs of money so all the theaters can have egronomically correct chairs. My rear prays for that day.

      So many things going on this weekend. So many things to do. Of course, I won't be doing ANY OF THEM since my car died late last night. I was getting ready to go pick up my little sis Deidre from work when the car went DOA, not even starting, making a little "veet" sound as the engine didn't even start, just sort of rapidly petering out in the most curt manor possible.       * With car now sick and hanging out at the repair shop I'm pouting because I'm going to miss out on  urlLink Street Rock  this weekend at the Kern County Fairgrounds. I love breakers. I mean, I really, REALLY, REALLY love me some b-boys. Like in a big way. I love them almost as much as I love Johnny Depp and anyone who knows me well, Johnny Depp is basically my number one obsession (next to cartoonist Aaron McGruder, Antonio Banderas and&nbsp;Dewars peppermint ice cream.) B-boys are just wonderful people. Period. So everyone, have fun at Street Rock without me. Show a b-boy some love and tell 'em Danielle sent you.  * "Ziggurat" is opening at  urlLink The Spotlight  this weekend. "Cabaret" is continuing at  urlLink The Empty Space . So is "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" at  urlLink Stars &nbsp;and "Dr. Dolittle" is at  urlLink Bakersfield Community Theatre . Also check out The Empty Space's late night offering, a collegiate take on "The Odd Couple."  * I'm planning on going to the movies this weekend, car or no car. I can't live without the movies. I want to see " urlLink Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle ." Being from the midwest, I have a fondness for those hamburgers whom most non-midwesterners would find utterly disgusting. Plus, I'm an avid supporter of minorities who are rarely represented in films. Hmmmm, when  was  the last time I saw a sophomoric comedy starring a Chinese American and an Indian American. Hmmm, oh yeah. Never. I saw a drama a year ago, " urlLink Better Luck Tomorrow ," which I enjoyed because lead actor  urlLink Parry Shen  reminded me of a young,&nbsp;handsome  urlLink Allen Payne  (star of "Jason's Lyric" and "New Jack City.") The film is essentially a mix of "Less Than Zero" meets "Juice."   As for&nbsp;"Harold and Kumar," I first heard about it&nbsp;well over a year ago through  urlLink this blog . I love both ridiculous comedies and serious drama, camp and action. I'm mostly excited about this because  urlLink Doogie Howser  is in it. (Is it just me or is Neil Patrick Harris like a really great name for an assassin or a murderer? John Wilkes Booth. John Allen Muhammad. Lee Harvey Oswald. John Wayne Gacy. Mark David Chapman. James Earl Ray. Lee Boyd Malvo. Harris actually plays an assassin in Stephen Sondheim's musical "Assassins.")  *  urlLink Rotten Tomatoes &nbsp;is finding Pitof's "Catwoman" extra-stinky. Like kitty litter. It's opening this weekend and I hope that it will at least become camp for some people, like "Showgirls" perhaps. If not, well, I'm sure someone will enjoy the S&amp;M undertones and bad girl action. I won't. But someone. Maybe.

      Rented a wreck this weekend from the nice folks at " urlLink Rent-A-Wreck ."  Sweet people.  Very helpful.   My  urlLink 2000 Mazda Protege  was on the fritz and for two days I got to coast around town in a lush, ocean-liner most know as a  urlLink 1997 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme . She may not be the prettiest ship in the fleet, but she made up for it with her pimp-like smooth ride. It was like gliding on air.   I spent the weekend in it, tooling it&nbsp;around town&nbsp;with my sister riding shotgun. Me&nbsp;slurping a large strawberry-banana smoothie, leaning to the right while &nbsp;listening to  urlLink 99.3 FM  (because all the car had was a tape deck). And they were playing  urlLink War , which you folks play a lot here in California. I mean, in St. Louis you will never hear a song by War, but here we were, cruising down&nbsp;Golden State Highway&nbsp;listening to " urlLink The World Is A Ghetto ." (Which is actually my favorite War song. Very apt criticism of urban life and the depression that comes with it.)   I felt very much like a pimp, but not in the objectification/subjucation of women variety. More like that bland, all-encompassing hip hop version that took the once dirty word and sanitized it for mass consumption.   The Rent-A-Wreck mobile was so great, that I was actually sad to turn it in for my perpetually messy Mazda, which had the faint smell of cat pee. After all, the Cutlass, despite being a total grandma car, smelled lovely and was all clean and pleasant, not funky with the odor of living. So I spent an hour Monday afternoon at the "cop" car wash on 24th Street getting my car detailed.   My sister and I discussed the play she's working on ( urlLink Spotlight's  "Ziggurat"),&nbsp;real estate&nbsp;ads that feature cartoons of homes as opposed to pictures of the actual site and the large number of police officers, sheriff's deputies, CHP patrolmen and government officials were there getting their cars clean. Even district attorney  urlLink Ed   urlLink Jagels  was there getting his car cleaned (and his shoes shined.) I don't really know the man. After all, we travel in entirely different circles -- me with my local bands and thespians and him prosecuting criminal suspects.   So now my car's undeniably shiny and clean and that's great. It smells all car shampoo fresh and it looks like they got up the remaining glass from that time my windows got broken out. It's all good I guess. But I still sort of, kind of, miss the Cutlass. You can't really be a pimp in a Protege, unless it's a tricked out Protege, which looks like a bastardized tricked out  urlLink Honda Civic  when you trick it out. I mean, if I'm going to be all chilly I can't do the thing wrong.   Oh well, guess I'm settling for being square.

      Bakersfield's patron saint,  urlLink Buck Owens  is turning 75 this year. His birthday party is going down next Tuesday at the Crystal Palace with Dwight Yoakam, Lee Ann Womack, Raul Malo and even John McCrae of Cake! Chris and Herb will be there. Heck, even I'm going to be there (as a member of the press, of course.) You can read all about it, and the people who are performing in today's Eye on Entertainment in  urlLink The Californian .

      Big Willie Will with the Uplift Comedy Club is threatening to help me find a husband if I show up at the show Wednesday night.  Although I'm considering dating again, many of you already know how disasterous that has been for me. Since Sgt. Kabukiman and I parted ways three years ago I haven't had much interest in finding yet ANOTHER husband. I tried being married and, God, it was horrible. But I digress ...  Willie Will might be able to find YOU a husband if you go to the Uplift Comedy Club at the DoubleTree tomorrow night. It's a great show. Lots of fun and Willie Will is a cool cat. A Q-Dog (Woof! Woof!) and a guy who puts together comedy shows for charity. And how cool is that? Go, have fun. Find yourself a man. I'll go find myself a martini.

      Stuff going on in local theater --  Jon C. Johannsen has been replaced by Jason McLain in the Stars Theatre Restaurant's production of "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum." Johannsen apparently fell and seriously injured his knee and is now under doctor's orders not to appear as Pseudolus in the Stephen Sondheim play. McLain stepped into the role with on six hours notice and apparently wowed the Sunday mantinee performance ...   Brian Sivesind is leaving the theater he founded to go to get his masters of fine arts in directing and the University of California, Irvine. Sivesind will remain on The Empty Space's board, but day-to-day operations will be handled by Bob Kempf ...  ... and Brian L. Lyons is leaving Bakersfield Music Theater to take a job with Kern Schools Federal Credit Union. Lyons was BMT's marketing director. He said he will still be doing some work for BMT, but only on a volunteer basis ...  ... The controversial "Angels in America" is opening this weekend at the Empty Space (706 Oak St.) The opening show will be a benefit for a local HIV/AIDS organization.

      I should have a new column coming out next Monday. I go on a rant about summer television programming. In it I name two of my horrible reality show suggestions. I have a knack for coming up with horrible reality shows, you know, since the bar's been lowered to hell-fire levels. Like, I'm afraid of just going into spontaneous combustion for thinking about these. But here they are, my top ten horrible reality show ideas:  10. Drag Queen Idol: RuPaul, Mario Cantone, Margaret Cho and show host Lorenzo Lamas grill tall men in heels trying to belt out standards with the flare of Barbara Wah-wah and Diana Ross. The winner gets to headline his own show on the Las Vegas strip.  9. My Big Fat Funeral: Man fakes his own death in a firy car crash. If he can plan his death well enough, and convince friends and family that he's really bit the big one, he'll win $5 million that he'll get to share with his duped peeps. Imagine the drama and surprise when Jimmy pops out of that coffin on the day of the funeral!  8. Extreme Racial Makeover: White folks become black, black folks become white, hispanics become Chinese, living a day in the life as a different race. Imagine the hilarity when the newly-white Tyronne goes to his first Civil War Reinactment battle as a member of the Confederacy! Hilarity!  7. OZ — The Reality Show: Is prison really like HBO's "OZ?" Well, 15 civilians get to find out when they're sent undercover into an actual, maximum security prison. Filmed in the Lerdo correctional facility, these innconcent folks will get the real prison experience, living as inmates and trying to convince the other crooks that they're the real deal. Each fake prisoner will be given a story as to why they got in jail (i.e. "Killed a man in Reno just to watch him die" or "tax fraud"). Then we watch to see who will survive! Every week a panel votes to see if "our" criminals will be released on parole or sentenced to another week in Lerdo's "OZ."  6. Super-Size Me: Ten slightly overweight people rush to pack on the pounds to win a free gastric bypass surgery. Watch them gorge! See how lazy they can be!  5. Get Me Out of Iraq, I'm a Celebrity: Todd Bridges, Lorenzo Lamas, Michael Bolton, Rosie O'Donnell, Kathy Griffin, LaToya Jackson, Emmanuel Lewis, Kathy Ireland, Pauly Shore and Vanilla Ice try to outwit, outlast and outplay while dodging bullets and car bombs in Fallujah. Through various challenges celebrities win things they need to survive in war torn Iraq: flack jackets, bullets and dry food rations.  4. Buy Me A Bride: Creepy American and European men bid on improvished and exploited women from southeast Asia and countries from the former Soviet Union! What will these men do to win their own Thai or Soviet block bride? Cover themselves in leeches? Learn how to speak Cantonese?  3. Grand Theft Auto: Take the America's Funniest Home Videos and Cops and what do you have? Criminals filming their own criminal activites and mailing it into "GTA — The Reality Show." Gun-totting hoodlums document their mayhem and carjacking for the amusement of our studio audience. Watch for the season finale when rival gangs compete to win "most violent" and "most likely to get caught" awards.  2. The Slave Life: What happens when a bunch of gangster rappers lose their cell phones, sky pagers, fly cars, groupies and bling-bling and are sent down south to work on a hot, cotton plantation? P. Diddy and Nelly star in this hilarious look at that "perculiar institution" called slavery. Will they survive Bobo and Mr. Charlie or will they go home crying for their Bentley's and Hummers?  1. The Slave Life 2: We "flip the script" this time, sending rich white folks to toil and sing old Negro spirituals while a poor black family gets the chance of a life time to live as wealthy plantation owners. What will happen they order their once rich n' famous help to make dinner for their family and get the tabacco crop in on time? Starring the Hilton sisters, Paris and Nikki, Justin Timberlake, Eminem and Trent Lott as the slaves.

      Whew. Took a week off there last week. Boy did I need it. I was tired. All wiggin' out. Buggin'. So I spent my last week hanging with my baby sis before she returned to St. Louis.  I put her on the plane today. Hope she makes it there all right. I already miss her. Who am I going to drag out to lunch? Who will I drive around town? Who will listen to me whine and moan? Who? WHO???

      Saw " urlLink Angels In America " at   urlLink The Empty Space . An elderly couple walked out because they thought it was a Juedo-Christian play about angels. You know ... as opposed to the controversial, passionate polemic about Reagan, Mormoms, the 80s, homosexuals (closeted and out) and the AIDS crisis. They walked out after Brian Sivesind (as Roy Cohn) shouted out "GD" for about the 400th time in less than 30 seconds in the opening scene.  But if you have been following the saga of Tony Kushner's mind-blowing play, you might want to check it out. See what Bakersfield has done with it and such and so forth.  Of course I'll have a review out in Friday's  urlLink Californian .
