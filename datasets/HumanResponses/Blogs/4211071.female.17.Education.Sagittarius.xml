       Oh okay... God, am I getting married? heheh :)... I don't know why I asked that and please forget about it... Nonetheless, it doesn't worth any answer... I'm 18!!! Argh... I don't even have a boyfriend, how can I get married???      Why do I asked that? Well... I was browsing few collections on the net and saw  Vera Wang's collections  (bridal, i mean)... It was so nice, glamorous... fantastic and I was dreaming that, am I getting married wearing those??? They were all so nice and I was dreaming wearing them. But I'm sure that I won't unless, I'm married with English lads... wakakaka~      Ok.. I ends here before I starts blurbing about wedding gowns... bye~

        Life is wonderful. Life is great...       I had my first exam this morning. The first paper was  English I  and the second was  Maths 'D' I ... I was quite good and hell. Thank  God  I set my alarm @ 6:00 a.m. Last night, I told my mom to wake me up @ 6 a.m. but then it ends up with me the one waking my parents up... And I came late to school. My dream study hut already occupied by the other lads... As usual, while waiting for my paper to come, I prayed endlessly... Hoping for the best~      Whether you believe it or not, I did predict the topics that were supposed to be out for English. And it did! It was the second part... Magazine article! I wrote about my favorite teacher of all,  Mrs. Teresita R. Asuncion . I didn't really know her all-out but I tried... After all, composition is all about making-up stories... I hope that I will get a B in English... Adding with my paper 2 (coming soon... 28/8) and oral.      I went back home at 12:30 p.m., fetched by dad. Then he drove the car to  Jangsak  and pick my little nephew,  Syawqi . Then I logged in to  MSN ... Chat with  Nurul . It was until 3:3o p.m. that I was off because I had to join my dad to fetch my mom at her office... I had to go because my nephew was going as well and guess what, he brought along 15 bucks with him...  haiyaa ~ Imagine that he is still 2 years old but already know the value of money... btw: I have no bucks left~ only $4... ( ashamed eh. .)      As usual, we stopped by @ SupaSave, Gadong. I shopped for food with my nephew while my mom went queuing @ Baiduri Bank. Dad as usual, buying newpaper at the bookstore. Can you imagine doing your shopping with a 2 years-old boy??? Aiyoo... He kept on choosing the things and put it in the basket... Thank  God  that my money is very much "enough" to pay all... But no worries~ My nephew got his own... heheh :)      Funniest thing of the day.. psstt... don't tell anyone. This is quite embarrased and I know that if whole of my friends know, I'll be dead into   FAME OF ASHAMED  ... Wanna know?? This morning, my mom bought me a new towel.. And guess what? She bought me a BARBIE towel......!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is all pink in color... My sister got the same and my big brother (whose age 25) got a spiderman towelll........... wakakakaka!!!!!!!!!!      I guess that's all... my fingers getting lame now...

        Haiyaa ... Yesterday I didn't come to school because I'll be having my qualifying exam on Saturday. I had been practising Maths the whole 'morning' not until I grabbed my a$$ to logon to Internet and met my long-lost family... Well, not really long-lost, just that we never knew each other before though we were both closely related... and he was online.. before, we only connected through  friendster.com  and yesterday, we were chatting together till afternoon.       Syarul ... he's my nephew, the son of my cousin from my dad's side. Frankly speaking, I am not that tightly close with the family from my dad's side because they're much-much older than I am. I even got grandchildren from that side... So, he called as '  babu alai  ' which I rather heard it cute and glamour~ We talked so much about stuff and he even gave me testimonial which is the most unique and funny testimonial ever. That man is so unique! So, he was @ Miri, yesterday. He stayed at my cousin's home there... I added my other's nephews e-mail add and even friendster... I think I want to make a bond with them. Not  JAMES BOND  but  family bond ...   It was raining heavily again yesterday... I watched  Athens' Games  the whole noon till night. Finally I cut off my nails... No more pain!!!       "You misjudge me for not being me. Why was I to blame when I did nothing wrong?? I don't know why my heart is so painful when I think about you... You are special to me. I realized that we were not meant to be together. No more tears and laughter... But you know what? I am  cool  now. I am fine with all the decisions you had made. I don't hate you though my heart is broken into pieces because of you. I am professional and I got the attitude. You don't have to care about me anymore because I will not be. This is the end of our lives... People said that friendship will never ends, but you and me just end it for an absurd reason... I hope you will think twice after this because life is worth a while... Goodbye!"        Happy Birthday (12th)  to my cousin,  Md. Hazwan Nabil ... May God bless you. May your life will be filled with prosperity and joy. Be happy always (and I know that you do)...  Adangtah main PlayStation atu...  Study hard for your success... And I'm praying for your safety and success always!!

         "Life is a trail... We follow our own trail with trials and tribulation. This is not the end. We had just started our beginnings of no where to end. Please don't let us down. Don't lose our hopes for uncertainty... Believe me. This is our journey which we have yet more to discover. Don't let your strength down. Hold it as if you don't want to let it go. We can make our own adventure by surpasssing out our dreams and thoughts to be true... We are meant this way but we'll make it happen anyway..."         I saw devastating faces today. I know that it is hard to accept a failure. I've been through it once and I am preparing my self not to do it again though it is hard. Please don't give up!! Dear friends: I love all of you. Having it through or not is not important to me because now that I learnt the value of friendship which is not the same as the value of money.        Sarip - I know it is hard for you.. I know that. I don't know why I care so much about you. Maybe because I don't want to leave this place without you. We are childhood friends... We were apart for so long that when I met you again, I just don't want to let you leave... I missed seeing your smiles and receiving your miss calls... Please smile tomorrow for me?? Or at least let me know that you are doing okay...        The meeting with Principal started @ 11.15 a.m. First it was the teacher whose talked so much about the recent and coming exams... I was glad that I did pretty well until I was kind of 'proud' of my self... The principal called out my name, telling that I was the best student in class... heheh :) ... He told me that I could be better next time. I was expecting him to call out someone else's name but he didn't. Then Azratul's name was called-out by him to recognize the whole students that we both are role models of the repeaters... heheh :)        "I don't think that I am good enough to be alive. I have few things to be sorted. I am blind. I am folded and I am magnified. Life is not easy by the thoughts I had made it was. But today I just realized that I am good to be me. Thank you for praying for my safety and success. All of the faiths you had given me will always be my remembrance... Thank you for having me for who I am inside and outside..."         Then I met Izzah & Tuty after that. We took pictured together. I'll upload it later when I have the time because the laptop is still unattached to the main switch.. Okay, that ends my blog for today. I am extremely tired of exhaustion. I'll upload the lad's pic later... By the way, I am having my qualifying exam this week. Probably I will not be updating any blogs till September... Wish me luck~ Opps... before I forgot, Happy 16th birthday to my cousin, Nizar... May God bless you and fulfilled your wished to be true... heheh :) ...        p/s: Please smile for me tomorrow?? Let this be your trial and take me as your challenge... Mark my words!

       Second day of happiness... today many people came to take their exam's slips from the  exam room . I was among the one who came early morning. Besides, I still need to attend the economic's class. I guess that I just misjudged people by their looks and I am lucky that I didn't get any further far from mocking them. I am not good with strangers but this morning I just made few friends along my way... Thanks for having faith in me!     The first person that I had spoken to was  Atiqah . She was waiting outside the library and asked me regarding my results. Well, I don't really remember what her results were but I am praying for her success since she congratulate me for having 3 credits. Thanks gurl :) Then  Amni  congratulate me for having credit for P.O.A ...  Amin ?? He got only credit for science and he was so damn  sasak  with my results... heheh :) By the way, I was with  Sal  since the whole morning until I entered economic's class.   Before I could further up typing the next, here is my exam's statement results:    English - D7;   Malay - B3;   Maths - E8;   POA - C6;   Science - C6;   Economics - D7          -to be continued-

       Yahooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!      I am so happy to the MAX!!! The ministry just gave out the  GCE June O' Level  results... I am so happy right now and there are no words that could describe my excitement emotions... I am finally going to college next year!! But before that let me tell you the events happening today...      ...      I woke up early this morning because last night I promised  Baieyah  that I'll be coming early today and I did though I came a little bit late*... So, of course my first destination would be the library but soon after I had finished my Biology's work, we both bought some food from the Mabohai... then accidentally, we ended-up sitting down at the 'pondok' near the school's hall... it was all renovated and of course, clean!   We talked-talked-talked until the library was actually locked and our bags stuck inside...      Thank God that the library opened just as the maths' class begins @ 1 p.m.  Mr. Teo  was great though we argued something regarding angle's properties. We were using our own method though actually I was supposed to be using his method... hehehe :)      Then it was the english's class by  Mrs. Teresita . She was great to me but I wonder why many students dislike her. She is the best teacher ever!! I respect her because she opened many doors for me last year... She taught me so much about English and made me interested more in English... then the hearty session begun... someone in my class received a text message from her sister telling her that the exam's results were out. I didn't believe it at start until she told me that she knew her results... my heart were beating so fast. I almost fainted but I still have my sanity in me................................. after all, waiting is the hardest thing to deal with....      I called my mom, though my credits were running low (and is nil now)... I told her that the results were out but she seemed to disbelieve it. Believe me, mom... It is!!!!! Then it was raining heavily with all the strong winds... by the way, today I just did a very good thing. I helped  Mrs. Teresita  and hold her an umbrella to her car...  baik kan ?? heheh :) Not so long then, my dad came to pick me up and I told him everything. I guessed that I was being too  anxious  about the results' thingy.. Dad rushed to the ministry and bought the disk and we rushingly go to my sister's home @ Jangsak...    Her laptop was lagged~ I really hate lag materials... then my mom called back and told me the results...    Hajah Nazliah bint Haji Nali  -- BN 103/48    1120 English - D    1201 Malay - B   2281 Economics - D   4024 Maths 'D' - E   5129 C. Science - C   7110 P.O. Accounts - C      heheh :)... I got 3 O's for this time. Last November, I got grade C for my English, U for Economics, D for my Maths 'D' and E for my accounting... quite satisfactory but my English, I'm still not feeling good about it... I'll try my best next time (November), aite????.............................. :)    Just now I'm texting with ezzah-wazzah... Really miss all the girls~~~ :)

       It was really a fun night! I was rocking to the down to the floor and up to the ceiling... the whole family were at my place (em.. my home actually)... well, not all really.  My sister  was sick, so she couldn't make it. Even my baby nephew was up until midnight because he was really annoyed with our 'fiesta'... The concert held really well. I watched all of them;  Zahid ,  Adam ,  Kaer ,  Farah ,  Bob  &  Linda .        Zahid :    He performed really well. The first song, he looked alright. He got the right mood and feel, just that I think he got his pitching wrong at few places in the song... chewahh, now i'm critisizing all of the them :)... for the second song, erm... not sure of what the name was but it was made by  Cat Ruffedge ... a  funky cool dance song . I was happy to hear that song, since I am  Ruffedge No.1 fan ! Overall... I'm giving  Zahid  --  9  out of  10         Adam :    What about  Adam ?? By his looks, he is cute and charming.. as for his dance, he got the talents in that particular moves :) but too bad,  Adam  wasn't giving his all best last night. His vocal were bad (for me). He got his pitching out to other places... the first song,  Oh La La ... I have no doubt that he is so crazy about  KRU  but he shouldn't have copyright the whole  KRU  idea... he must have done somehing different which possess his true identity, like representing his group,  Es D Corp  (it sounds like that yo~)... as for the second song, it was great!!! He did quite well with the song made specially by  Ajai .. I like the melody of the song and the lyrics as well... Overall... I'm giving  Adam  --  6  out of  10         Kaer :   Well, I wasn't hoping that  Kaer  would win anything. I don't think that he is strong enough with his vocals and performance...  Kaer  didn't possess enough of him last night, which was quite  devastating  for me and my family as well. I was thinking that Kaer would threw all of him but he didn't! He was still with his R&B clad... he needs some changes... he should open more to other genre not only concentrating with R&amp;B... :'( ... he sang  Michael Buble  -  Sway ... the second one was really into lullaby... I like the lyrics and the composer was really great and cute... Overall... I'm giving  Kaer  --  6  out of  10         Farah :    I have no other words to express her performance.. she was superb! She was great!! Too bad that she didn't win any of the 3 places! I was hoping that she could be the winner or second after  Zahid ... Overall... I'm giving  Farah  an excellent grading --  10  out of  10         Bob :   Another talented man from  Limbang, Sarawak ...  mesraaaa~~ ... too bad  Bob  didn't win. He presented his two songs very well. I like  Bob  ( as for his vocal and versatility )... I don't like his attitude... so, there is nothing for me to say about his performance... Overall, I'm giving  Bob  ---  9.5  out of  10         Linda :    Arghh! I hate you~ I don't like you from the first week even! I hate it when you in back after the wildcard. I was hoping that  Zarina  would join back for the final. I don't want to comment her because she done it BAD~ I'm not trying to discriminate but she was last night... she didn't perform it well... sorry  Linda ~ at least you won.. Overall... I'm giving her ---  4  out of  10        Ah... I'm so tired~ this morning my mom woke me up and asked me to join her to attend a wedding @  Serasa . I was okay with it, since I was really in the mood of  jalan-jalan . I met lots of cute lads. I met   MATUL  !!! She was there... but I was in different part of the function :)... ok, it feels like my fingers  kan putus  because I had been typing for 3 hours now...        p/s : I'm going to get my new  AR - Alfio Raldo 's shoe and handbag today... I paid it already, opps.. my mom had paid it for me... yahuuuuuuuuuuuu~~ I'm going to have new stuff!!! I'll be sending my  kains  to the boutique for my Raya and oh... did I mention that I'll be sitting exams on the first week of raya?? Yeah, I am!! I'll be having new clothes for my next year's raya...  uwaaaaaa  :'(

       I'm not feeling very well since last night. I am fine but my headache struck me with not considering the place & time. I hate headache~... I just want to get well and watch the final shows for tonight. Ergh... tonight will be the final concert of Akademi Fantasia 2. I'm not into it anymore but since I watched it almost all the time, I should watch it, just to keep me notified of who is the winner... by the way, my home will be full tonight because we're having barbeque for nothing. I think my family wants to celebrate the Athens... hehe :) ... everyone is talking about Athens globally!      I slept @ 3 a.m. this morning because I watched the opening ceremony of the  Athen's Olympic .. it was great and superb! I am proud to watch the ceremony... I know the feelings of the participants because I was once participated in such an event. How I wish that I could repeat those fabulous moments...  (I really miss all the students, friends;  Saliha ,  Amy ,  Jalilah ,  Izzah ,  Aminah ,  Nidah ,  Midah ,  Rahmat ,  Zulfakhri ,  Hafizan ,  Jimmi  &  all F 1B mates Year 1999 ... I really miss all of you~ :'( )    Life was fantastic then. All the laughter and joy we had share will never be forgotten. Life is simply the best when we were all together doing our practises and enjoying our 'not-so-good' foods... I really miss all...  haiyaa ~       I woke up as usual at 11:15 a.m. Another hectic day for me but I felt so good because I only have one period of study at school at that could come to Mathematics by  Sir Moza . My best girlfriend,  Nurul Baieyah  didn't come to school because her uncle was unable to send her to school. I was alone but I was lucky enough to have  Sarip  to accompany me the whole period. I was with him and we studied Maths together but half-way through,  Amin  joined us to it together... After I had taken my usual attendance, I went straightly to the exam room to take my November GCE O' Level exam's timetable. So, there is no way that I could escape exams, or rather much to say,  quit  school :'( ...      Suddenly,  Teacher Hashimah , my Economics' teacher came in with her fierce look. I was asking my self, where did I got wrong or did I done something against the school's rules or what?? Alot of questions lingered in my mind... I looked at  Sarip  and  Amin , they even got a very  clueless  look. Is it something to do with my class attendance or what???... But soon, the class turned into a very unexpected environment...   Someone in my Maths' class just  conteng-conteng  someone else's father's name which for me is rude and lame! How rude that kid is! I even angry at that person but still remained  unknown . I pitied her... All of the students were swearing for the truth and it was so funny that my group;  me ,  Sarip  and  Amin  were targetted... heheh :)   It was raining heavily after that... it was  Sir Moza 's last class for us. Next week,  Mr. Teo  will be back teaching us Mathematics. I'm going to miss him because he is so cool and cute~ heheh :)       I went back home straightly after school. Saw  Izzah  on the road. I didn't actually sees her but I think she's in the car. Now I am still counting days for my GCE June O' Level exam's result to be out... just wish me all the best... ok, I have to move out now. I need to help my other lads downstairs for tonight's fiesta!! By the way, the channel 902 is now showing swimming... is there Ian Thorpe?? heheh :) he roxs!

       assalamualaikum... hello... hi...   now i am back the my norm state. finally my wish to have a blog is fulfilled. i don't really know how to start because i am just 'brainfreeze'... by the way, let me reiterate my life starting the moment i woke up... or anything which crossed my mind now...   erm.. i woke up @ 11:15 am. i overslept again... i'd been oversleeping for the past weeks... i don't know why i really woke up late but i think, i was just being so tired or over-stress... i am still learning to wake up early because i am still not use to it... by the way, my exam is coming up... starting 21st August until 2nd September... then i went back to school as usual, though my head still  sleeping ...     i studied chemistry and physics with  Mr. Raja ... i was tired still... i just couldn't escape class because of the exams are coming. even my head still can't wait for the  JUNE GCE O' LEVEL  exam results to come out... i predict that the results would come out by this week or next week...  Mr. Raja  was busy explaining 'chemical reaction' with  Baieyah ... then Amin  kacau  when i was so busy finishing my physics paper...  haiyaa~    economics' class was cancelled... i was hoping to study economics because i didn't attend that class yesterday... well, it was the assembly's fault. i didn't follow my fellow friends to the school hall because i am sick with assembly.  Baieyah  and i went to the corridor and sat there while listening to the media played on my Nokia 6800. oh god... it was raining heavily and i wrote some blog pieces in there... let me paste it here... >>       "ahhh... feeling cold~ if only i am in my room, definitely my head just want to sleep... eh, it is raining heavily here at school... i miss my pillows and blanket already. ah, what do i usually do when it rained? don't fral out if i say that i love when it rains... i love walking in the rain with my trans-blue umbrella, drinking hot tea or chocolate... it will be just great! i bet that my tv won't receive any signal at the moment at home... probably if i'm at home, i will be ended-up reading or surpass my ideas of writings... ahhh, how great it'll be???   if only i were at home now*...   you might be wondering of why i have the time to do blog... my economic's class was cancelled due to the 'occurance' of school's assembly. i didn't want to attend cos i am sick with assembly!"
