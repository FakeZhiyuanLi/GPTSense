I just got the results...and it turns out that I totally kicked ass on the TOEFL test. Though I shall not disclose my scores online (even I am not that Big-headed) but...Suffice to say that I did SO much better than I ever thought I would.   Phew...What an adrenaline rush.

      &nbsp; I am sick, ill, &nbsp;and have been infected by a virus/bacteria that is slowly devouring me from the inside.   I'm also a drama queen. (Could you tell??)   Truthfully though, I am sick. I started getting dizzy during my last period class yesterday, and then continued to get worse. I do feel somewhat&nbsp;better today, but only after I've thrown up about eight times in total. My toilet and I have have gotten much better acquainted over the last twenty hours or so.   So...That's why I'm here at home in the middle of the day, instead of sitting in my English Lit class like I should be.   Oh crap *hand over mouth* I've got to go and pay another visit to my new best friend, Mr. Toto.      &nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   A few hours ago, my younger brothers and I launched an attack on the many disgusting horseflies that have been buzzing around our house lately. My brother hit them all with a newspaper and threw them in the garbage bin, but they (amazingly) kept crawling out. So...We put the garbage bin the bathroom and sprayed it with a ton of RAID in an attempt to kill them (buahahahahahaha). But because the smell of the insect spray was so bad,&nbsp;we closed the bathroom door...Only to remember that the bathroom door handle was broken.   So yup...We were locked out of our bathroom.   Now...This was a problem...Seeing how there was only one way into this bathroom, and&nbsp;we had just sealed it shut. Not to mention that my parents weren't home so when they found out....Well....Suffice to say it wouldn't be pretty.   So....(dum da da da da daaaaaaaaa) SUPER SISTER to the rescue!   You see, I have some experience with this matter. It's a long story, but something similar happened in my old house in New York, only that time, the door was actually locked. Funny how this stuff often happens to me. Anyways....So,&nbsp; we tried to open the door for a few minutes, but because the handle wouldn't turn, there was no way it was going to budge. Then I ran downstairs and got my Dad's toolbox, grabbed the screwdriver, unscrewed the door handle, and voila....Took the handle off the door.   But...Unfortunately that's when I hit a dead end. I found myself staring at this metal rod thingy...Which apparently was supposed to fit into the door knob. After a while, I realized that the rod is what turned the door....So then...After like 5 minutes of hard pondering,&nbsp;I picked up a monkey wrench (guys, aren't you like totally impressed that I even  know  what a monkey wrench is? I know I am) and used that to turn the metal rod....Thus....OPENING THE DOOR!   hurray!   After I reattached the handle to the door, I was left feeling oddly proud of myself. Like hello people...I just fixed a door! It was amazing. Now I know that I'll be able to survive in the harsh real world.   :D   Just call me HandyWoman&nbsp;Annisa

      I was in the car this afternoon, on my way to the mall when the song Graduation by Vitamin C came on. Now even before, this has always been a favorite song of mine but today I almost lost it. Like seriously, I was&nbsp; going to cry...had I been alone, I'm sure that I would have.   This got me thinking about how powerful music is. Just hearing an song can envoke such powerful emotions. For example, everytime I hear the song "Wherever You Will Go" by the Calling, I feel extremely nostalgic about the old times my best friends and I have had. On the flip side...any Britney Spears song annoys the shit out me and I turn change the channel/station. Meanwhile, any Spice Girls or Backstreet Boys song makes me feel like I'm eleven years old again, spending all my money on their merchandise. Can you believe I used to collect the stickers that came with the Spice Girl lollipops?   God, those were the days.   &nbsp;

       Exes are the most confusing people on the planet. After you've broken up, your relationship becomes extremely muddled. What are you? For example, if you were with a friend and you bump into an ex, how would you introduce them? Oh, this is so-and-so, my former lover? That sounds like something from a cheesy romance novel. Do you call them a 'friend'? But what if you now hate their guts so much that just the thought of calling them your friend makes you want to hurl?&nbsp;The safest thing may be &nbsp;just to keep it simple and say, "this is my exboyfriend (or girlfriend)..." but what if you regret your past relationship so much that you just don't want people to know that the two of you dated?   My advice? I say the best thing to do if you spot an ex is to run as fast as you can in the opposite direction. Yes, that's right...   run for your life! It's the attack of the Ex!     Unless of course, you're dressed in an amazing outfit, just got your hair done, and have a better looking new lover hanging on your arm.   But then again, who has that luck?  &nbsp;

      A good friend of mine who for years has been a proud atheist, has recently decided to become a Buddhist. I was somewhat surprised because this person is the most stubborn person I know (apart from yours truly perhaps) and therefore this change was rather unexpected. But then again, it's my theory that everyone needs something to have faith in.&nbsp;However while the sudden leap of faith was somewhat surprising to me, the religion of choice was not. It seems to me that a lot of people who have rejected the more...Conventional religions, typically end up as Buddhists. Now I don't mean that Buddhism is unconventional...Come on, half of my extended family are Buddhists. But the thing is, for some reason, people always view Buddhism as the more mystical religion.  &nbsp;  Why is that?  &nbsp;  Christianity and&nbsp;Catholicism are religions cultured in the Western World, in large, impressive churches. Islam was born in a dry and sandy country.&nbsp;But Buddhism comes from a far away land that was (and still is) steeped in spiritual and supernatural folklore...Does that perhaps play a large role in society's viewpoint?  &nbsp;  Or maybe it's because Buddhism is all about the path of enlightenment. In other religions, the main goal is to live a good, clean life,&nbsp; preferably by following the established dogmas, and then...Get to heaven. But Buddhists strive to find inner perfection. It seems to be more about the journey than the destination. It's not about pleasing God, but (in a way) pleasing yourself. Perhaps  that  is the main reason why Buddhism is so popular for those who disagree with the other religions.  &nbsp;  I just want to say that none of what I said is meant to be offensive or favoring towards one religion&nbsp;as opposed to another. &nbsp;This is just some things that I was thinking about last night. I don't really know what I'm talking about. Trust me.  &nbsp;  Anyways, on a lighter note...I was recently in Australia right where , they are so environmentally conscious that everywhere you go, &nbsp;they have special toilets that have two flush buttons...One is a half flush (for pee) and the other is a full flush (for when you take a dump). I guess that way, water is not wasted. But the thing is, now that I'm back in Jakarta, where there's only one way, every time I use the toilet and flush, the flush seems to go on for so long and I always worry that the toilet is broken or stuck or something. Plus, now I feel guilty about using so much water when I pee. Welcome to my complicated life.

      Okay, so right now I'm sitting in computer class and it's so riveting.  Not.  I've been back at school for about an hour right now and so far, everything seems the same...nothing has really changed. I'm not sure if that's comforting or disturbing. Huh. Well, enough about school.   Over the month holiday (yes, only a month...can you believe that? It's a travesty. A travesty I tell you!) I got a lot of work done on my manuscript. It's kind of a big step to actually write that word...Manuscript. You see, other than a select group of few, I haven't told anyone that I'm writing a book. Why? Because most people probably don't think I'll be able to pull it off...Unfortunately my parents are two of these people...So when I tell them, they kind of nod patronizingly, when it's pretty obvious that they think I'm stupid for attempting it. Or maybe I'm just being paranoid. Whatever. The point is, I wrote three really good chapters over the holidays. Now I've basically got two more chapters to go before I'm done. HOWEVER, after rereading what I've already wrote, I've realized that the first chapters are crap so I have a lot of rewriting to do. But ah well...   You know I have this book called "Why Girls Are Weird" it's a fiction story (not a self-help book!) about this woman who starts her own blog and it becomes so popular that it spins out of control until hundreds of people read her site everyday. Now that got me thinking about my own blog. It's rather odd to think that people I don't know are reading my thoughts. But then again.........  Maybe nobody reads this. Maybe I'm the only one who ever visits this page. Whoa...now  thats  a major blow to the ego.

          When I woke up this morning, a major realization hit me. Tomorrow is my last first day of high school. Confused by the contradictory words? Here's a tip, read it  slowly . It's the last time I will have a first day back at high school. It's so weird to think about that...I suppose the whole finality of finishing high school is what's so scary.  The ironic fact is that while I may be sad that I'm finishing school soon, I REALLY don't want to go back tomorrow. School now seems so...blah. It has become humdrum and routine...With the same old teachers and the same people. There's not really any challenges anymore. I'm afraid that my lack of motivation will screw up my grades this year. Not to mention that a certain someone (you know who you are) won't be coming back. This sucks because this person made life interesting...And kept me awake during math class.  This causes me to wonder...If school is so boring...Then why don't I want to leave? I guess that it's because the things that make it dull...Also make it safe. Does that make sense? What I mean is, the familiarity is comforting...People are always afraid of what they don't know right? To tell you the truth, College/University (whatever you want to call it) scares the shit out of me. Living alone in a foreign country scares the shit out of me. But being stuck in the same place and always following the same routine? That scares me even more.

         As I sit in front of the computer, the thought hits me that perhaps, seeing as this is my first blog and all, I should write something deep and meaningful. However, intelligent as I am (he he he), I do not, unfortunately, churn out brilliance like a sausage maker (I have no idea why I thought of that odd simile). So...screw 'deep and meaningful'...for now anyways.     This afternoon, my little brother was watching a cartoon-The Justice League- you know, the one with all those comic book heros fighting crime...and it got me thinking...given the opportunity, which superhero would I date?     Now, as you can see, this is a very complex question that requires a lot of consideration. I spent a lengthy time deliberating, carefully weighing the pros and cons of all the colorful costumed heros....Here's my process of elimination:          -Spiderman: Okay, as hot as Spidey is, the guy never gets a break...His life always seems so messed up...He's got WAY too much emotional baggage.           -The Hulk: Hello?! The guy gets all green and psycho when he's pissed...Need I explain?          -Daredevil: he's a lawyer on the side of good (how rare is that?!) But, not to be discriminating, but his blindness does pose some problems (granted, it didn't seem to prevent him and Elektra getting it on in the movie though)          -The guys in the X-Men: They're Mutants...and thus their freakish and extreme genetic mutations mean they can never blend in. I think that would be a problem.           -The guy in the fantastic four who looks like a boulder: have you ever seen a weirder looking hero? What were the comic book creators thinking? I guess that Fire guy was supposed to be the hot one in the group. Ha ha, get it? "Hot" one? (Yes, yes, I know you're probably rolling your eyes)         -Superman: Now, this was a toughy. I mean come on, Superman is the epitome of the word superhero. He's really hot and has (let's face it) the best powers of them all. The only problem is, Superman is a goody-goody. Like really, he never has any fun. It's all about saving the world and doing the right thing...he's a boy scout. Hence, as almost perfect he may be...I think he's too uptight for me.          And therefore (drumroll please) the superhero I would choose...is BATMAN. Okay, first of all, Batman has no superpowers Though that means he may not be as powerful as the other heros, it's important because it means that he's NORMAL. Dating would be so much easier. Plus, he wouldn't have a superiority complex about being all "special". And Batman, in case u havent noticed, is really hot...all tall, dark and handsome. Also, unlike Superman, Batman seems to have more of a mysterious, bad boy streak. And, one more added bonus, Batman aka Bruce Wayne is a millionaire *Ca-Ching!*   Gee, I bet you're all impressed by my brain now aren't you?

       If my estimations are right, then I've been single now for about a year. I'm not quite sure when the actual exact " anniversary " is, seeing how at the time, it never occurred to me to write in my calendar, "I am now back on the market," probably because there were other things on my mind.       I find it hard to believe that it's really been that long. A YEAR, ALREADY?? In that respect, I guess I'm lucky. I'm sure that are people out there who are continuously counting the days of their "singledom".       Now, I have to be honest, when I was about to take the LEAP and break up with my ex last year, I was terrified (my friend Christina can attest to this, I spent so long on the phone with her, trying to work up the nerve to bite the bullet and do it). My last relationship lasted more than a year, and when you've been part of a couple for that long, you get used to always having someone. You get accustomed to the idea that if you feel lonely, there's always someone you can call.       Breaking up with my ex was the hardest thing I've ever done, but not for the reasons that you're probably thinking. You see, I was afraid of being alone. I had become so used to the security of being in a relationship that I had forgotten what it was like being single, and that scared the shit out me.       But you know what??       I now think that it was the best decision I've made. Because...I'm free. My life is so much simpler, so much happier, and so much  easier  now that I'm single. And not only that, I know that I can survive on my own, and that knowledge is so valuable to me.       Like I said before, this last year has flown by. I've been able to try new things, like the violin, and get back into my writing. I've spent more time with my friends, my family and myself.      So, this weekend, I'm going to celebrate my one year anniversary of being single. I'm going to check out all the hot guys I want (because I can) and I'm going to go out and buy myself something nice.       And to my special group of friends who might be reading this...thank you. Your friendship, crazy humor and endless support have made this year go by so much faster.       Of course, the fact that you guys have been single most of the time has helped a lot too ;-)

                  What to say, what to say? Lately, I’ve been experiencing a really bad case of writer’s block. Ugh, it sucks like hell. I feel like there’s some big chunk of something that’s jamming the passageways into my brain.             Anyways, I’m chatting with a friend right now and he’s giving me all this advice (which seems to happen a lot) in regards to my previous entry entitled “Today ranks high on my list of ‘Shitty Days’”. Advice I did not ask for, might I add. But still, I know he means well so I’m trying to be all open minded and accepting. I don’t know. I just don’t feel like being all deep thinking.             Why?                         Maybe because the person that I want to chat with is not online. And he hasn’t replied my message yet either. Bummer.          My lack of creativity is bothering me. Enough for today.

        Okay, you know my friend test thing? Well Angel just pointed out to me that there's this person simply named "Someone" who took both her test and mine. Hmmm....so I checked it out and now my interest is sparked. Because this person knows me pretty well, and got a pretty good score, but if they were a friend, why didn't they just write their name? Huh...Intriguing.  Who art thou, mysterious stranger who hast taken the test? Why art thou hiding behind the anonymous cloak of disguise? Come forward, oh "Someone" and quench mine burning curiosity.  Sorry, I've been studying Elizabethan England and I think that it's gotten to me.

      *Yawn* I am so sleepy. This morning, it took me ten minutes to pry my sorry self off of my extremely comfortable bed. This is ironic, because last night, I couldn't sleep. So what did I do last night? Well, I watched Halle Berry and Benjamin Bratt being interviewed by Oprah, and I felt sorry for them because they seemed pretty nice, and (at the time) probably didn't yet know that their movie was going to bomb. I guess that's what you get for changing the story of Catwoman and for casting the wrong woman in the lead role. But whatever....anyways, so after that, I went online momentarily, but refrained from signing into MSN messenger because I knew that my friend would probably be online, and once I start chatting with him, I can never stop, and then I'd never get to bed.  But I digress so....  Last night, before I finally drifted off into la-la land, I realized that I don't have much more time until I have to take the dreaded SAT IIs on the 9th of October. Argh... You know, when I first registered to take the tests in October, they seemed so far away, but now it's looming closer and closer. And, unfortunately, unlike the TOEFL which was easy-peasy lemon squeezy, I actually have to do a LOT of studying to get a decent grade on these damned tests. That means that...it is once again time to crack open those thick SAT textbooks. God, I can't wait until I've finally applied to all the universities and I'll be able to (somewhat) slack off.

              Today during math class, I lost it. Seriously, I was stuck on this one freaking problem and then I just started laughing for no reason at all. Why? Well I was so damned stressed about a couple of things (which I shall not go into right now) and I was so emotional that I had to get it out somehow. My only option was either crying or laughing...so I figured the latter was best. So there I was, laughing like an idiot and my math teacher said jokingly, "Oh, Annisa's having a nervous breakdown, let's all watch."   This all started with my computer presentation. I spent every lunch for two weeks in the computer lab working on it, and yet all the animation shit meant practically nothing because it seems that it was  very easy  to get a good grade. And so I went to go ask my computer teacher about it, and you know what? He acknowledged that fact that he knows that some of the presenations were of a higher level, and yet he can't do anything about it because of the set marking criteria. Argh....            I can't really explain how frustrated I was (and still am) feeling. It's just that I'm so fucking tired of trying so hard and always putting in so much effort and yet it's never quite good enough. I used to have an edge...English lit has always been my  thing . But recently, I've lost that. I'd like to just blame it on the new substitute teacher, but I can't really. Yes, he has really high expectations, but I understand that he's just trying to push us. He's raised the bar and I've failed to raise  my  level of work, and I think that pisses me off more than he actually does (which is saying a lot).            I know that most of you who are reading this are probably rolling your eyes cuz u can't understand why I take this stuff so seriously. The truth is...I don't know. Some part of me wishes that I could just be like those other people who don't give a flying fuck, but I can't. Why? Cause this neurotic, overcompetive, overachieving nature is part of me.       I'm also really stubborn. So I'm going to sit here and wallow in my self misery.       Wallow, wallow, wallow.

        This morning, my friend Angel showed me this quiz she made about herself to see how well her friends know her. I tried it...and got 70/100. Hmm...not as good as it should have been.           So....since I'm bored and have a lot of spare time, I made one of my own. So...my dear friends especially, if you're as bored as I am...try take it. I'm curious to see how well you know me. But...be warned. It's more difficult than the SATs, TOEFL, ACT, and AST combined. You may perhaps want to do some extensive research and cramming beforehand.           to take the "How Well Do You Know Annisa?" quiz, follow the link below:         urlLink   www.blendedlatte.friendtest.com

      A friend of mine, (you know who you are baby) moved away to Bali a couple of days ago. To tell you the truth, when she left, or rather, when I saw her last, I wasn't really sad. This is odd because I'm normally really crap at saying goodbye, and yet here I am with one of my closest friends, and everything was hunky-dory. I figured that it was all due to the fact that she wasn't moving that far away, and I knew that it wasn't goodbye as in "goodbye FOREVER". Anyways, so there I was, about to go home, and I was  fine.  Everything was cool, calm, and under control. But then she sprung it on me. She told me that I was her best friend.  And that's when the emotions hit me like a bulldozer. You see, I don't think we've ever referred to each other like that. I knew that we were really tight, and I have always viewed her as my best friend, but I was never really sure if I was hers. This girl knows so many God damn people, and she has  so  many friends that she hangs out with that I didn't think that she would consider little old me her  best friend . I know I may sound kind of stupid here, but bear with me people.  So what did I do after she told me this? I pretended like I was still fine...like everything was still cool, calm, and under control. Then, in the car ride home, I thought about it a lot. Why did I suddenly feel like our relationship was even more special? Technically, everything was still the same. Did the simple word "best" abruptly mean that our friendship meant more? Did one tiny little word really make that much of a difference?  I don't know why I suddenly got all mushy that day. Maybe I was PMSing.  Anyways, last night I finished reading  Black Notice  by Patricia Cornwell. I read it in only about a day...I totally could not put it down. Apart from a really intriguing new murder case, the book also deals a lot with grief, as the main character's lover just died in the last book. It was the best book I've read in a long time (except for my own of course ha ha ha), which is saying a lot because I've read around six books in the past two months. But now I can't wait to go and buy the next book in the series...
