      Hello candy kids!!  well, it has been done, my hair is short.  and i LOVE it.  i was surprised, i didn't get that many "WHY DID YOU DO THAT?!!" looks today at work.  just one inconsequential girl.  but i got a lot of compliments, which is fun.  i got my boss at my "other job" to take my picture, and i sent it out to everyone, except my parents, cuz i'm gonna see them tomorrow. (shit! i forgot about that... WOOHOO FREE FOOD!!) anyway, i can't wait to see the look on their face. :)  hehe.  i realized last night, that i don't take any kind of medication anymore.  no birth-control (which says a lot about my sex life), no anti-depressants (which says a lot about how little my sex life affects my happiness)...  i often wonder how the medication our society ingests affects us.   urlLink the crap in the food too.   i mean, is the meat really affecting things like puberty and emotional balance??  hm... cancers, early puberty, low sperm counts... i can't imagine what my kids will have to go through.  maybe i'll just win the lottery, quit my job, and move to a farm and grow my own food.    ah yes, the ever present need to win the lottery.  it's strange to me how easily we believe that drugs have no long term effect.  i find it strange that birth control has no long term effect.  that babies born after it's mother's been taking birth control for 15 years are perfect.  but i guess i'm just skeptical suzie!!  there are also the fun drugs, and their unknown effect on our poor poor brains.  There are theories that Ecstacy might cause Parkinsons disease... but nothing yet to support that theory, thank god.  just long-term depression and anxiety, fun fun!!  to end on a weird note, cuz it's just how my brain works, i was at this little work get-together, was looking around at all the older people, in their 40s, 50s and 60s... conservative, normal if slightly boring people... and i thought to myself... all these people have kids!  therefore... ew... all these people have had sex!!  i started wondering about their stories.  did anyone marry because they got pregnant?  or because they got their girlfriend pregnant??  are any of these guys gay (because some of them  so  are, but have kids and wives...) ??  why is it that we think sex between old people is so gross?  hm... i hope that when i'm 40, 50, and 60, i'm still gettin' it on...  and on that note, my dearest candy kiddies, i'm outs for lunch. :)

      i prayed that when i woke up there would be so much snow that it would be CRAZY.  but there wasn't that much snow, and the subways were still running... so i had to go to work. ug.  well, the Oscar nominations are up, you can  urlLink check them out online at the Guardian .  i really really want  urlLink Les Invasions Barbares (The Barbarian Invasions) to win!!   the film was nominated in the Best Foreign Film category... it's a great movie, and Denys Arcand deserves to win.  it would be nice for a Canadian/Québec film to win.  i LOVE the Oscars.  i've always dreamed of going to win something... my acceptance speech... "i would like to thank the Academy.  and god.  and my mom and dad.  and my brothers who always knew just how to provoke a reaction in me.  my friends whom i love dearly and who have always been there for me... sob sob.  thank you all, thank you so much!!"  ya.  i have these dreams when i'm sitting on the toilet.  nothin' better to do.  you know how it is.  ug.  this snow is all everyone's talking about.  "the biggest storm in AGES!"  ya, well, whatever.  i wish i was 5 again when it snows like this.  go build forts with G and have my mom makes us some Ovaltine (i can't get over Ovaltine...) sigh... ah those yesterdays... (as i break into song)  ahem: Pearl Jam's "All Those Yesterdays"  Don't you think you oughta rest? Don't you think you oughta lay your head down? Don't you think you want to sleep? Don't you think you oughta lay your head down tonight?  Don't you think you've done enough? Oh, don't you think you've got enough, well maybe.. You don't think there's time to stop? There's time enough for you to lay your head down, tonight, tonight  Let it wash away All those yesterdays  What are you running from? Taking pills to get along Creating walls to call your own So no one catches you drifting off and Doing all the things that we all do  Let them wash away All those yesterdays All those yesterdays All those paper plates  You've got time, you've got time to escape There's still time, it's no crime to escape It's no crime to escape, it's no crime to escape There's still time, so escape It's no crime, crime..  All those yesterdays...  Oh Pearl Jam... such melancholy, such poetry.  nothing to do with the snow and memories mind you.  just, you know, the same phrase.   anyway, i'm setting up a photo-site, like an album site, and i'm posting the x-mas party pictures.  Gigi asked me for some and i couldn't compress them enough to send them via e-mail, so i set up this site.  if anyone has any interesting/fun pics they want me to put up, send me the pic and i'll put it in the album. ;) lalala.  i'll link the site in my next post.    that's all for now.  i have nothing to say really.

      can’t trust that day Monday, Monday sometimes it just turns out that way Oh Monday mornin’  Monday mornin’ couldn’t guarantee that Monday evenin’ you would still be here with me. everyother day (everyother day) everyother day (everyother day) of the week is fine, ya but whenever Monday come (but whenever Monday comes) you can find me cryin  all of the time  well hello there!  it’s monday and i am sans-coffee.  hopefully, all of that is about to change.  actually, before i write any more, i am getting me some tea or coffee, cuz my brain is in slow-mo.    my brain is in slow motion and NOTHING IS WORKING.  but before coffee a little congradulations are in order to Ms. Sarah Jessica Parker (from, of course, Sex and the City), to Ms. Frances Conroy (Mom from the deliciously depressing Six Feet Under), to Ms. Charlize Theron (Monster is really good), and to everyone at The Lord Of The Rings ROTK for their Golden Globes.  everyone was lookin spiffy and were all very deserving of their pretty prizes, i thought.  anyway, so i mentioned my hair cut to a few people over the weekend.  you’d think i’d told them i was gonna kill myself, “Maria, NOOOOOO!!!!”  um, what?  oh, i’m sorry, you must’ve thought i was asking you whether that would be ok!  silly me, no, i was just letting you know that that’s what i’m doing.   blink blink!! giggle giggle!!  will i become a man if i get my hair cut short?  will i be a butch dike?  the long hair thing is getting boring, and anyway, i never do anything with my hair.  so Wednesday, it’s gone.  mouhahahahahahahamouhahahahahaHAHAHAHAHA!!  i am so evil.  i will torture everyone with my hair cut!  HAHAHAHAHAHA!  ahh... now i have some caffeine in me.  life is good.  and i'm still getting my hair cut.

      ah yes Friday.  if you thought i hated work any other day, just think how it feels to work here on a Friday.  practically everyone is “working from home”, except me, of course, since i’m just an admin assistant. i'm demanding the right to a 4-day work week.  ug.  talking about something else now:  why is it that on the news we only hear about bad people and bad things? war!  death!  murder!  disease!  violence!  drug busts and rapes and guns... it’s so depressing.    let's not forget the endless babble about superstars...  what would be news if we didn’t have evil in the world?  (like Britney...) God forbid we should discuss peaceful nations, scientific researchers that come up with cures, solutions to homelessness.  instead we try to figure out, “why are there guns in schools?” “why is our world so depressed and ill?”  why don’t we just all shoot ourselves?    in our constant search for “reality” and “truth” where do we find answers?  certainly not in the nightly news.  on the internet?  there are a few daily news feeds that i check out daily, let’s see what their headlines are today.    first,  urlLink the Guardian : 18 percent of Brits don’t want Jewish PM Tonge sacked over terror remarks Bird flu: EU bans Thai chicken Boy, 11, Killed in Border Shooting isn't that nice.  now, for  urlLink Salon.com : Dems Debate Issues Before N.H. Primary 11-Year-Old Girl Gives Birth In Ukraine (holy crap! ok, that’s interesting on a lot of levels) bla bla bla Kickbacks bla bla bla Dean yawn  oh geez.  anyway, you get my gist.  i swear i'll never pick up an issue of Adbusters ever again.  so depressing (ya maria, but they're telling you the truth!!!!!) PUH-LEASE.   the truth that corporate america are a bunch of asses who need to be taught a lesson?  no guff.  the truth that our environment needs help?  really??  the truth that the food we eat is full of evil things?  i just won’t eat anymore!    BUT WE WANT A REVOLUTION MARIA!!  DON’T YOU WANT A REVOLUTION??!!??  ok, fine, yes, i would like a revolution, but if i keep reading Adbusters ima gonna hafta take all those anti-depressants they're saying are bad and drown my pain in non-bio foods.    tell me what i should do!!   tell me how to fix it... not how it got broken.   don't make me angry... make me hopeful.   give me hope, and i will give you a revolution.   on that note, i'm hungry.  McDonald's anyone? have a good weekend y'all.

      i just wanted to mention something quickly, about the hair thing: should any of my long-haired friends think of also getting their hair cut short, you should remember that there are some people not-so-fortunate as to have any hair, due to cancer.  there are organizations that help people (mostly children) find real-hair wigs.  you can donate your hair for the cause.  just make sure you tell your hair-dresser before the haircut, since most foundations don’t take dirty and damaged hair (i’ll just sweep this off the floor and into a bag...)    for more info:  urlLink  in Canada, through the Canadian Cancer Society ,   urlLink and in the States the organization is called, Locks of Love .  happy clipping!!

      well, it has been decided.  the appointment is made, and so is my mind.  i am getting the shortest haircut known to man.  (literally)  clippers may be involved.	 it always ends up this way.  i grow my hair long, i get annoyed, i cut it short.  but never this short.  this is gonna be the shortest of the short. i’m excited.  and i’m nervous.  but mostly, i’m annoyed, so, ya.  the hair is going.   i can smell the freedom from here.  oh ya baby.  on another note, B’s been making me think of 80s TV show theme songs since i met him.  i’ve been trying to stump him since then and i finally found one.  the problem is, i don’t know the answer myself.   i even looked on the internet, but all i got were the lyrics. what the hell is the theme song to Punky Brewster??   B defended himself by saying that he “never really watched that show.”  yaya B, sure sure. if i find it, i'll be sure to post a link to it.  and if anyone i know knows it and can sing it (G??)  CALL ME.   end my torture.  sob... sob...  those of you who are familiar to Margaret Cho’s website may have noticed something strange in her links.  i think it was G who first eluded to the fact that this person has a blog, but it wasn’t until i noticed the name on Marg’s website that i flipped out! you guessed it! (but probably didn’t):  urlLink Wil Wheaton .  for the Star Trek geeks out there (and i know you are many, don’t try to deny it) he was Wesley Crusher, the son of Dr. Beverly Crusher.  i'm admitting it now, so don't make me say it again, yes: i had a crush on him.  him and Wil Riker.  shut up.  he was cute, smart, sensitive, ambitious... now he’s grown up, married, and has a blog.  a very popular blog at that!  so, ya, you should read him, he’s funny.    the thing i love about blogs, is that you have something new to read everyday (or twice a day in my case). they’re romantic, funny, well-written... some of them anyway.  blogs hark from the tradition of writing letters to far-away friends and relatives.  prose laid out on the page and including the most “intimate details”.  dearest friend you know not how long i have dreamed of telling you my hearts desire...”  i feel like i’m in Little Women. :)  as much as i hate my job, i don’t know how i’d find the time to write like this if i wasn’t so bored here.  here’s to my having many more boring jobs to come.  better get back to work.  ug.  deep thought of the day: when all else fails, get a cookie.

      ok, ok, i think the comments should work now.  stupid comments. gigi calls me back last night and was like, "ton affaire là, chu pas capabe de posté d'ostie d'comment!"  he sounded really mad.  i thought he was mad at me, but he was just mad at the comments. :)  hopefully you'll be able to post.  i tested it, and didn't get any error message, so hopefully... «crossing fingers»  anyway, Kristin Davis (Charlotte from Sex & the City) was on David Letterman last night.  she was cute, but ditsy.  Letterman is funny. he clipped together different parts of Bush’s State of the Union address.  funny stuff yo.  can’t say i did much else last night except watch tv.  discovered that my computer font program was just a Demo and that i don’t have the serial number for it (Existenz Suitcase, G do you have the serial number for it??) the snow was insane this morning.  blowin all up in my face.  not cold though, just annoying.  my computer's not doing too well, i'll write more later.

      well, my faking sick worked and people are being so nice to me at work today. :) i worked hard and i think i accomplished what i wanted to yesterday.  i'll find out when i see my boss today at my " other " job.  i want to talk about the  urlLink State of the Union address last night.  if you wanna read it first, go ahead.   first thing i thought: mr. Bush has a really good speech writer.  when it was on TV, his face got in the way of my paying attention to what he was saying.  plus, i tuned in just in time to hear him reading that letter from that little girl (awww!... so cute... the little girl wants to support her country! -- please note sarcasm).  trust me, read it and then listen to it if you want, but reading it makes him seem like a real president.  watching or listening just makes you wanna kick him.  that man's face does not inspire trust in me.  (*y m'inspire pas confiance) you know how you can just tell whether you can trust someone or not.  that instinctual gut feeling.  alarm bells go off when i look at the President of the USA.  annoying fire alarm bells.  like at 2am.  he bugs me that much. what really bothers me is this whole "sanctity of marriage".  please.  puh-lease.  if you really really wanna, how does he put it? "respect individuals as we take a principled stand for one of the most fundamental, enduring institutions of our civilization. Congress has already taken a stand on this issue by passing the Defense of Marriage Act, signed in 1996 by President Clinton. That statute protects marriage under federal law as a union of a man and a woman, and declares that one state may not redefine marriage for other states... Our nation must defend the sanctity of marriage."  if you want to do that, Meester Prezident, you might want to outlaw divorce, not love.  the "defence of marriage" act is just a law saying that every state decides, independently of... here, it's complicated lemme just quote: "No State, territory, or possession of the United States, or Indian tribe, shall be required to give effect to any public act, record, or judicial proceeding of any other State, territory, possession, or tribe respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under the laws of such other State, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such relationship."  it all began when a judge in Hawaii decided to allow same-sex marriage.  reps from other states freaked because they were afraid that it would affect their state laws on marriage.  so the US government drew up an Act defining marriage as a heterosexual and monogamous act.    in other words, if you get married in Hawaii, or in Canada for that matter, when you return to your state, they don't have to recognize the fact that you're married, because you're gay.   Hawaii had a vote and rejected that judge's ruling that gay people could marry.  one step forward, two steps back.  ug.  well, i'm fully depressed right now.  better get back to my boring job.  i haven't gone to the gym yet this week.  my reason is that i left my gym clothes at N's house and haven't had the time (or the inclination) to go and get them.  tonight perhaps.  i wonder what has to happen in our world for people to realize that homosexuals are people too.  Did you know that Dick Cheney's (the Vice-Prez'z) daughter is a lesbian?  oh the times, they are a-changin'...  i have confidence that things will get better, that the US government will become more open-minded.  they're a bit behind the times, we'll have to forgive them.  another prayer perhaps?  let the babies of the 1970s, 80s and 90s be more open-minded about the world than our fathers' fathers, especially when it comes to love.

      i skipped out on work today, called to say i'd been puking all night and couldn't come in.  :) me baaaaaaad. oh well. it actuality, i have tons of work to do for my "other" job and needed to come in to finish it all.  so i'm skipping work to come into work.  hm... never thought i'd say that. last night i had an argument / discussion with my roommate about reality TV.  it's the bane of my existence.  stupid reality TV.  god.  i think it makes people dumber for having watched it.  my roommate kept wanting me to switch the channel to Average Joe.  for the love of god, NO!!  is there anything more demeaning?  and then the conversation turned to getting boyfriends and sex.  my roommate was talking about this possible boyfriend and he was wondering whether this guy was really for him.  the comment he made was: "he dresses too gay."  um, ok.  sure.  but, rommie, you're gay, so you must also, "dress gay".  "you think i dress gay?" "no, i'm just saying that that's a stupid thing to say. it's like saying that i dress like a girl.  of course i dress like a girl, i AM a girl. get it??" and then i got into how i need me a man.  but a gay-straight man.   is it too much to ask for?  a straight guy with whom i can discuss Tom Ford or watch Will & Grace?  a guy who dresses well and goes out dancing?    anyway, to be continued, i have to get to work y'all.  thought of the day: when all else fails, call in sick.

      i just wanted everyone to know something, before i go to my “ other ” job... margaret cho rocks.  the more i read her and listen to her, the more she rocks my world.  i think we’d be good friends.  we’d sit around, eating icecream and talking about fags and racism and Tom Ford... mmm icecream. i’d get her stoned. wouldn’t that be the funniest thing  ever ??  margaret cho stoned???  hehe. for those of you who don’t know margaret cho, you really should.  check out her website,  urlLink www.margaretcho.com or .net , whichever.  she has a blog too, in which she talks about whatever the hell she wants to talk about.  oh, and rent and/or buy her DVDs.  i wouldn’t suggest watching the Margaret Cho DVDs around your parents though.  k?  just trust me.  watch her, read her, and then show your parents, should you think it appropriate to do so. Margaret Cho for president!!  anyway, i’m about to shoot myself and i’ve only got about a half hour of work left.  let's see if this day can't go by a little faster by wasting my time, shall we?  i forgot to say that i went to see a chick flick with J’s roommate’s girlfriend... if that makes sense...  on Sunday afternoon.  we had a good time seeing Mona Lisa Smile.  when i was at J’s later and i was on the phone with B, he said he was watching football (it’s almost SuperBowl Time), and i said that i had just seen Mona Lisa Smile.  we agreed that him watching MLS is like me watching football.  that’s how much i like that sport.  he promised to try to explain football to me whilst watching the superbowl.  after over 20 years of having my brothers explain this sport to me, i still don’t get it.  maybe B will have more luck with me.   Note to self: don’t forget to wear deoderant.  i’m thinking of getting a funky hair cut.  like, a short one.  it’s the ongoing battle with my hair, cut-it-short, grow-it-long, cut-it-short, grow-it-long... we’ll see.  peace out y'all. word to your mamas.

      first off, i just wanted to say that i've tried to activate a comments page so that people could, well, comment.  i have many very intelligent friends and family whose comments i'm sure will prove invaluable. :) for example, i received an e-mail from my bro this morning saying: (and i copy-paste) "Activate comments! I would have put this link on:  urlLink http://right-thinking.com/comments.php?id=P3825_0_1_0  It's a movie of an Apache gunship shooting Iraqi insurgents. WARNING: Disturbing, graphic, even though it's in night-scope." i've done what i can G, i've done what i can... hopefully it'll work.   what a busy weekend i had, and fun too!  it started with a long night of work.  i was tired and expected to go home early to bed.  but it was not to be.  i blame it on J.  i met him and his darling g-f for a drink around 9pm and it became a few pitchers with Brutal B at Einstein's. after Einstein's we went back to J's and partook in a little of Bilbo's pipe weed. i got home around 4am.   i woke up the next morning wishing the sun hadn’t risen.  my beautiful window faces South, hence why i need to go to bed early in order to actually get some sleep.  ug.  so i got up, ate, and went to the gym.  after i met my best girl for dinner (indian food is yummy), i went to N’s for a parté! i had a great time.  i wish i could hang out with those boys more.  fun stuff yo.  N and i promised we’d go to ikea soon.  Ah ikea.  what would we do without you?? i left my gym bag at N's though.  i'll have to go back and get it tonight.  poor me, an excuse to go hang out with one of my best boys...  speaking of best boys... gigi told me last night that his dad's not doing too well.   his dad’s g-f even said that he may not live to see March 2004.  unbelievable.  parents don’t die.  grandpa’s and grandma’s die, but not parents.  unreal.  gigi asked me whether i thought he should go home to spend more time with his dad.  God!  of course!  what would a few weeks of time spent with your dad mean to you?  think of what it would mean if you didn’t go...  gigi said, “i would pray if i prayed.  even go to church.”  funny how, when the going gets really tough, we turn to god.  i told him he should go.  go to a church and pray.  to me, it’s almost like meditating.  it’s all about sitting in a sacred space and focusing on a specific thought, concentrating your energies on a specific thing... let’s all pray for Gigi’s dad this month.  let our thoughts to toward him and help him to heal.  i've always been fascinated with god, or the existence of god. i guess i believe.  not in a guy with a beard on a cloud, but in some sort of higher-power... cliché, perhaps, but i believe that the energy, the karma around us comes together to form some sort of "higher-power". or maybe it’s just something i heard on Oprah.  regardless, it’s nice to believe that human beings have the power to change the world simply by changing the way they think.  sounds simpler than it is i guess.   anyway, that was my weekend.  i did go to bed early last night, thank god.  i feel good this morning, ready to face another grueling week.  B lent me “Dude, where’s my country?” by Mr. Mike Moore.  i’m eager to get to reading it, i’ve only just started.  he starts the book by talking about those who died in 9/11.  death is so sad. ...

      ok, i promised myself that i would only write a blog once a day, but i’m way too bored.  seriously.  so instead i pretend i’m doing the work i’m supposed to be doing.  but i’m not.  oh so sneaky.    sneaky and paranoid.  i’m so afraid of getting caught.  that is, i’m afraid until i realize that i have nothing to be afraid of.  what are they gonna do?  fire me?  fire me from my insanely stooopid and boring job? insanely stoopid, boring, and  temporary  job?  anyway, i don’t wanna talk about work.  i wanna talk about making a bunkbed.  i’ve decided that i’m getting/my-dad-is-making-me a bunkbed.  i have a small room and i want my bed to be on top and my desk to be below so that i can have a little more room to breathe.  also, i think that it would be cool and therefore, i would also, by association, be cool.  bunkbed cool = maria cool  also, it would permit me to make the area in which i sleep very dark if i surrounded the bed with curtains.  maybe i could actually sleep in on weekends if i had a dark area in which to sleep.  mmm darkness. The Darkness is also very cool.  maybe if i get their album i’ll be cool by association too.  Darkness cool = maria cool  i wonder if The Darkness have bunkbeds.  almost slightly cooler than The Darkness is Homestarrunner. aka  urlLink www.homestarrunner.com   if you do not know Homestar, you really should.   check it out.  check me out first though.  then check ‘em out.   pure genius they are, pure geenius.  but i digress. ya, so my bunkbed will have bookshelves and a ladder and curtains and and a big desk that i can fit my computer on n’ stuff and um and it’ll be AWESOME.   maybe i’ll paint it.  maybe i’ll paint it red.  hm...  anyway, me thinks i need a cookie.  a better job, and a cookie. ttfn! m.

      well, here it is,  my first blog .  yay me!!  i'm at work, and as per usual, i'm bored as all hell with nothing to do.  and i'm hungry.  and i'm quite warm.  i'm quite warm because it is really really cold outside.  it is really cold outside because it is Canada and it is January, therefore i am wearing a big sweater but was not very smart and wore a tiny tank top under it.  and i can’t really strip down to my tank.  i do have  some  class.  teehee.  J says that i should be used to this weather already, " where  were you born again??"  i have therefore developed the theory that i was actually born elsewhere.  like in Greece, or the Carribean.  somewhere warm.  somewhere hot.  birds have the right idea.  i wish i was a bird.  DEEP THOUGHT OF THE DAY: i need to do more in life.  sure, i'm working 2 jobs and i'm trying to go to the gym everyday (with which i am having some success!!)... and i hang out with *some* of my friends (wish i had more time for them too...) but i want to do more.  take more pictures, design more random stuff.   watch less tv.    there's the key to life.   watch less tv.   NOTE TO SELF: pilates is evil.

        A little hung over, here i am, on the computer, while it's 30 degrees outside.  i'm tired and tanned... having a great time.  i got here and my dad told me that my grandma died on friday.  my mom left to be with her family hours before i arrived.  it's sad... i wish i could be there with her.  we're trying to figure out how to send flowers... i just want to talk to my mom.  i'm avoiding any news of how Sex and the City ends.  someone posted a comment and all i saw was Big and i closed it.  i don't wanna know, i'll find out when i see it... hopefully i'll be able to avoid any talk about it.  hopefully.  quite frankly, carrie can do whatever she wants.  she's a big girl.  (you go girl!) ;)  not as many boys as i had hoped, and i got my period this morning.  yay me.  great.  now i don't feel like wearing a bathing suit.  i just want to curl up on the couch and eat ice cream.  mmm ice cream, good idea.  back to the sun i go...

      *  First:  The Metrosexual.   Ok, my roommate, who is being very annoying of late, or maybe i should say, with whom i am very annoyed of late, says that there's no such thing and that a guy who dresses well, takes so much care of himself -- must be gay.  i replied by saying that i would very much enjoy if the boy i was dating took good care of his grooming and appearance! (god forbid!!)  the conversation ended there since i've been very loud with him of late, but i'm sure i will try to prove my point again one day.  Second, it's raining.  it's raining, then it will get cold, everything will turn to ice, and so, yes, they are putting salt EVERYWHERE.  my new jeans are-a gonna get RUINED!!!!!  i'm very angry with Toronto right now.  did i mention i'm going to Cancun on Monday?  Third, what is with drive-by shootings?  one happened in Toronto yesterday, some 16 year-old kid got shot... what is the point of that?  what is the point of a drive by shooting?  ug.  i guess there is no point, other than anger with a little stupidity thrown in.  just put the gun down, for crissake.  sheesh!  Fourth (i have a lot of points to make this morning!), Carrie will end up alone.  she will not go with Big, she will not end up with Alexandre Petrovsky, she will stay with her friends, and be the cool independant woman that she is.  MARK MY WORDS.  (for those who are confused, i am discussing, of course, the final episode of Sex and the City).  i should have money riding on this.  cuz i am SO sure.  Finally, i saw the creepiest woman on my way to work today.  she had this walker, and she had this blanket over her head (like a comforter), bright red lipstick, and a half inch of eyeliner around her eyes.  very creepy... very very creepy...

      ... i hate playing the waiting game... it's so frustrating.  D came into work today and was like, "UN DODO!" cuz she's leaving for Cancun on Saturday... no fair.   i know, i know! i get to go on Monday... but it's killing me to have to work until then.  i'm so bored and tired that i could just shoot somebody.    i went to bed early last night (around 10:30pm) and had a lot of really strange dreams.  like really strange.  i can't really remember them though, which is kinda frustrating.  i remember vaguely being in Montreal, having my cousine m-c be there... huh.  J was there too i think.  all my dreams meld into one in the morning.  i can't wait to only work ONE job.  i mean, i don't mind doing little things on the side every once in a while, but two jobs that i have to tend to every day is making me crazy.  which is why i am SO looking forward to a week of nothingness.  a week of beach and sun and HBO... a week of zero responsibility.  i came home last night to my roomie saying, "your travel agent called"  hehe.  i have me a travel agent!!  D's sister-in-law died of cancer.  cancer sucks eh?  minor understatement, i guess, but still... any disease that makes people suffer is quite aweful.  may she rest in peace.  in these days of dreary end of winter... may we all find our little ray of sunshine.

      *  well, my date was OK, but nothing to write home about.  he was nice, but a little too normal for me.  i think that he felt the same way.  not my type.  it's all good.  but what's even  better  is:  drum roll please...  I'M GOING TO CANCUN IN 7 DAYS. (counting today).  i leave next Monday.    tell her what she won bob!  Well, Maria will be spending 7 days and 7 nights in the luxurious 5 star Royal Carribean resort in Cancun Mexico! where she will be fed by her parents and will sleep like a baby!!  not only that, she'll also enjoy scuba diving and visiting Mayan ruins.  when she's not sight-seeing, she'll be lounging on the beach AND SHE WILL COME BACK WITH THE  BEST TAN EVER !!!!!   (like Kermit the Frog) YAAYAAAAAAAAAY!!  ah, i feel better now.  you can imagine that i'm hitting the gym every day now, and i have to get new shoes.  and a bikini wax.  ouch.  not looking forward to that one.  maybe i'll get my nails done too.   so many things to plan!!!! eeeek! ok, too excited. breathe.  mmm american boys... ;) k, see, i haven't been in Cancun since i was 16.  when i was 16, i didn't have a clue what i was doing and i was picking up.  can you IMAGINE what it's gonna be like now that i KNOW what i'm doing?  bad girl.  nono, i'll be good.  or will i?...  hihi. so excited. how will i contain myself until Monday??  a whole week of warmth.  bathing suits, sun, sand, pina coladas... mmm...  k, gotta work.  grrrr... monday... monday... monday...  7 days!!

      * ug.  i have a date tomorrow.  i'm nervous.  mostly since i've never met the guy.  i met him... online.  ah yes, the wave of the future.  i've been talking to a lot of people lately who have "resorted" to online dating services such as  urlLink Lavalife  or  urlLink Face-Pic.   you ask the question, "so, how did you meet?"  the eyes look down, they smile akwardly and they answer, "Online..."  a year ago i may have thought that that was gross, dangerous, and especially desperate, but look at me now!!  i have a lunch date tomorrow.  i'm trying to keep personal information to a minimum.  where i work, where i live...  and now tomorrow we're having lunch.  at Wylde Oscar's.  he's never been in the village.  which is refreshing, yet weird.  who's never been in the village?  he seems easy going, he hasn't made any racist, sexist, or assholist comments.  he has a degree.  ug.    i'm over analysing.  and i'm not getting any work done.  my boss said that i have to finish what i'm doing before i go to Cancun next week, and i can't seem to get myself to concentrate.  so bored.  i had a good Valentine's Day weekend.  hung out with the kiddies and grandma.  i'm now back in the afaghan world of blanket making.    N had a birthday party on Sunday night.  it was fun, but i dropped my polaroid camera and it's not working now.  :(  i broke it i think.  and i still have another film at home.  damn it!  i'm a little tired today, but i'll live.  i have a weird rash just next to my belly-button.  i'm blaming it on my new pants.  it's so itchy!!!  well, i'd better finish what i'm doing.  save me.  wish me luck for tomorrow.  send me cute boy faeries.  please, let him be cute... (fingers crossed)

      (to the tune of Can't Touch This, MC Hammer)  My mother's cookin's so bad makes me feel oh so sad I  can't wait to eat at the restaurant down the street  her cookin is so lousy and woo! what a smell  when i say  MOM and she says WHAT and i begin to yell CAN'T EAT THIS.  (da na na na - na na- na na) can't eat this (da na na na - na na- na na) can't eat this   i'm having a musical day.  who WROTE that song?  i seem to remember memorizing it with my friend when i was 7 or something.   urlLink it's not Weird Al , which was the assumption when i was making photocopies and singing it to myself.  a quick check online showed me that Weird Al has his own version of Can't Touch This.  so now i'm obsessed.  my my my mother's cookin's so bad, makes me feel, oh so sad...  oh so, so sad...  who ARE YOU!?! writer of this song??   urlLink margaret cho's blog is really funny today, you should check it out.   i'm a little hung over, so mine won't be so funny. i went to "FunHaus" last night.   urlLink a band was playing, Eden Ants,  and my friend C's boyfriend is the guitarist.  what a crappy venue.  FunHaus is no fun at all.  don't call something the fun haus if it ain't gonna be fun.  the band was fun, but not fun was the fun haus.     However , drinks were $2.50.  that was fun.  a little headache today though.  just a little.    it's Saint Sapukoo Day tomorrow.  i tried explaining the concept of St-S day to some new friends, and i came off sounding like i wanted to kill myself.  i explain:  in high school, we went to this house party with a bunch of friends.  when you came in the door everyone would say: "We are born into suffering, and rewarded by death.  Happy St-Sapukoo Day."  ok, so we were teenagers, and we were depressed about love.  love sucks.  i'll celebrate whatever the hell i want.  but i'll wear red.  but only cuz i like red. :)  i did a little research into the whole "Valentine's Day" event.  apparently it all started because of a greek/roman myth, Lupercus.  boys would line up, and pick a card from a box.  the card would have a girls' name on it.  then that boy would be that girl's "mate" (hubba hubba) but then the *Church* decided that that was no good.    Mr. Valentine could be a number of people who defied the Emperor or whoever by marrying people when he wasn't supposed to. (why wasn't he supposed to, you ask?  because the Emperor wanted the men to go to war, and you don't wanna go to war if you have a girlfriend or a wife.)  And so Mr. Valentine got killed for marrying people and he became ST. Mr. Valentine.    aww... ain't that sweet?? oh, and  then , since the *church* didn't want people performing any pagean rituals, like the mid-February guy-picks-girl Lupercus thingy, then they replaced it with a saint's name, and we do the exact same thing.  THE END. k, gotta do some work, bleurk.  i'm going to Oakville this weekend to visit with my grandma.  a little R&R, a nice bath, good food, learn how to attach my granny-squares together for my afaghan. :)  peace out y'all...

      What i really love about where i work, is the day care centre downstairs.  I love that when i go get my coffee, i see little kids holding onto a rope, or running ahead of their mom to get to the play centre... “MOMMY?! Um. Um. You know mumble mumble.. Um. Um” they are SO cute.  Little people amuse me.  Especially when they’re not mine.    I love them in passing, i wave at them, make faces at them, stick out my tongue... i could just pinch your cheeks!!  When i was a kid, i would talk to myself, play with my “imaginary friends” (knowing full well they were imaginary, but what was i supposed to do?  NOT talk to myself?) (Oh, and i would ALWAYS win.)  I miss those days... swinging on the swing all morning, watching soap operas with my babysitter all afternoon... taking naps where i would dream i was flying through the house...  Kids are so random.  They’re so instinctual, so emotional.  When they don’t get what they want THEY BAWL THEIR EYES OUT. it's so sad that i don't GET TO EAT MY CANDY!!!! PLEEEEEASE... plEEEEEEEEASE!!! let me have my CANDIIIIIIIIe!!!  don't make me go to sleeep... no no no no peeeeease!!! nooooooo!!! nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! aHAHAHAAAAAAAAH WAHHHHH!!  memories... ah yes childhood.  now, if you made me go to bed at 7pm, i would kiss you.  PLEASE LET ME SLEEP... plEAse... sob sob...  i need sleep.  in other news: i would just like to clear up how i feel about the whole "janet jackson thing".  i am not shocked, i did not find it disrespectful... i just thought that it was the wrong event to do that in.  the problem i have with it, is that just before, P.Diddy was dancing around with half naked girls... girls making out in the ads... the problem i have is that these girls aren't getting naked cuz they feel like it, they're getting naked because they want to seduce the boys.  They're not getting naked because, foo!  it's getting a little warm in here, let me just take off my sweater, they're ripping off layers and grinding with each other to get the boys all hot and bothered.  and it works!  these girls get famous, and they sell men's magazines very well i'm sure.  what makes me really angry, is that it's GIRLS who are buying these albums that these musicians are making.    Janet, girls will buy her album. Britney, girls will buy her album. Madonna, girls will buy her album. Kylie Minogue, girls will buy her album.  and as hot as i think these girls are... it just bothers me that that's what i have to contend with.  this is why i hang out with a LOT of gay guys.  because they like the same singers as me, they think they're hot, but in admiration and without machismo (: A strong or exaggerated sense of masculinity stressing attributes such as physical courage, virility, domination of women, and aggressiveness.)  i'm also kind of freaked out by the huge deal it's been made to be.  governments are getting involved.  you see NFL people with their angry wives in the background... "it was wrong, and we are angry." puh-lease.  just forget about it.  everyone else has.  and now i will too.  lunch time!  toodles y'all.

      I had the craziest dreams last night.  I dreamed that I was at home in North Bay, and that the phone rang.  when I picked it up, it was my Montreal ex-boyfriend's brother-in-law, calling me about some sort of job.  immediately i got nervous, because i didn't want my ex to know i was on the phone with his brother-in-law, and then, all of a sudden, i was in front of this guy, talking to him about this job, and my ex comes running in, angry as all shit, and starts yelling at me, and running after me...  so i start to run away and head straight for the car in the garage (cuz we're still in my parents house in North Bay... anyway, the last thing i remember is that i'm in the car, i lock the doors, but the driver's side window is still open??!! and my ex is clawing at the door, trying to grab me, so i hit the gas and got away.  then, i woke up.  thank god.  this morning, my alarm went off at 6:45am, then i went back to sleep and had another crazy dream.  i dreamed that i was with my high school crew and we were going to go see Christian play somewhere... some outdoor venue... the dream isn't very clear to me... all i can remember is that i was trying to get to him, but i couldn't find him for the longest time, and then i looked in the mirror and i had this god aweful short-long goin on, and then i had to change my clothes and my shoes... this guy started talking to me, and all i could think was that i had to go and find Christian, but i couldn't, and then when i finally did leave this weird house, i went onto a big field/park to find him and i did and he was with the MC from the band, Nigel, and there were a lot of people around them, so i couldn't get to him still... Nigel said something and then Christian barked.  not sure what that means...  and then i opened my eyes again, and it was 7:30am and i really really had to get up to go to work.  and now i'm at work, and i'm tired, and i'm really curious as to why it was ex-boyfriend night in dreamland last night.  if i figure it out, i'll let you know.

      i went shopping this weekend.    but before i went shopping, i did many other things.  friday was the most boring day at work EVER. But i survived.  After work i went to my other job and GOT PAID!!  I love getting paid.  I went to the liquor store, bought a couple bottles of wine for dinner with J... then i went home, got changed, went over to J’s and had THE BEST MEAL EVER.  EVER. E-V-E-R.  Wow.    EVER.  If i haven’t explained this yet, J and I made a little bet a few weeks ago.  There’s this White Stripes song, see, and i was singing it to myself one afternoon: “We started living in a big house, my ma gave birth and we were checking it out, it was a baby boy, so we bought him a toy, it was a ray-gun, and it was 198*”... the argument: 1981, or 1984.    I said 1981, i was right, J made me the BEST MEAL EVER.  I’d describe it, but i’d get something wrong and not do it justice... here's the message J sent me Friday afternoon: "OK, so I've got just about everything all prepped up already for tonight. I rolled up the veal last night - cutlets, basil leaves, grilled eggplant, sauteed portobellos. Oh, and after I sauteed the portobellos I deglazed the pan with a lot of port, and then let that bubble away, so I've got a really nice port/mushroom reduction to go along with the sauce. Some baby carrots with lots of butter, some asparagus - I hope your hungry." so so so goood... drool drool.  Then, J and i made our way to the Mod Club Theatre where the  urlLink Pocket Dwellers were playing.   The Pocket Dwellers is this awesome Funk/Jazz/HipHop band that my ex-boyfriend Christian plays guitar in.  They were awesome.  That club is really nice.  Every time i see Christian, and his band, i always get this feeling like i just ain’t as cool as they are.  But maybe that’s just cuz i was really really drunk.  I got too drunk.  Fortunately, i don’t think i did anything stupid.  Regardless, i had fun, i got to see Christian, who is as hot as ever (from a safe distance), and shook my booty til 3am.  Then i went home, and i went to bed... NONO!!  I went home, i called christian (i know i know... i just called to say that i had a good time, not to vow my undying love, don’t worry) and then i passed out in my clothes, still wearing my contact lenses. Ya. on saturday, my roommate and I went to breakfast at the 360 (yay 3.99$ breakfast!!) and then went to rent some movies (and i bought laces and some polaroid film! Yay to getting paid).  Saturday night we went to Buddies, and i had too much beer, once again.  But so much fun was had, it was crazy.    Whilst at Buddies, right at the end of the night, as i was retrieving my coat from the coat check, i found my ticket, dropped it, and as i went to pick it up... i ripped my jeans at the knee.  Darn it!  But it gave me an excuse: OH NO!  NOW I NEED NEW JEANS! So on Sunday, i went shopping. 350$ later, i have 4, count them FOUR new pairs of pants (one of which a new pair of really comfy jeans), 2 dress shirts, one a-symmetrical sweater, a new belt... am i forgetting something?? No, that’s it. :)  Then, after my shopping extravaganza, i went to my girl S’s for our brand-new weekly girls night.  S used to live just out of Toronto, so i only saw her once in a blue moon, but now her and her hubby rented a place down the street from me (or a 7$ cab ride)... so now, on Sundays, we’re gonna get together, have cocktails, watch Sex & the City, then dinner... then chit chat. :( Sex & the City is almost over... :(  Anyway, while i was at S’s, i learned something very interesting: actually 2 really interesting things: 1) apparently birth control pills are making fish sterile.  How?  Girl takes birth control, girl pees, pee goes into water, fish drinks water, water makes fish sterile.  Huh.   urlLink Check out this link... the studies are still preliminary, but it makes sense, no?   Also in the birth control conversation, S said something that made a lot of sense to me: birth control screws with girls heads.  I could make that link.  I started taking birth control when i started dating Christian... me? psycho? no... I haven’t been taking birth control since i moved back to Toronto in September, so in 5-6 months, and i’ve been happy and good.  Is there a link??  Perhaps not, perhaps so...    Ah yes, the ever present need to know what the hell is wrong with us...  All i know, is that i need to get me a doctor, and get me fitted for... da da da... a diaphram... hehe.  I said diaphram.  on that note, i'd better get to work. ug. have a nice week y'all.

      but i've seen you naked, i'll prob'ly see you naked again... Milli Vanilli told you to blame it on the rain, but if you blame it on the rain tell me what can be gained so... if all else fails you can blame it on me.  ah The Barenaked Ladies... poetic genius.    I’ve been so tired all day that i really want to shoot myself in da head.  God save me.  I can’t help but imagine the rest of my life being this insanely boring and thinking that i should just end it now.  but then i go to my “other” job and realize that the rest of my life won’t be so bad.  i'm actually happy and shouldn't complain too much, but i'm tired, and broke, and well... most of the time, tired and broke makes me unhappy, but luckily, i have awesome friends that make me feel better.  it's either that or the fact that i was so *un*happy before that anything is great by comparison.  i keep thinking that my life in Montreal would make for a great fucking soap opera.  i could write like Danielle Steele:  *Maria's Hell* a gripping tale of a girl... of a girl what?  what the HELL was i doing there??  a gripping tale of a girl trying to... ug.  trying to be something she wasn't.  i'm going to see "You've Been Served" tonight at the movies.  it's a break-dancing movie.  the moves in the commercial looked IN-SANE.  i don't really care if the rest of the movie sucks, i'ma justa goin for da moves baby.  AHAHAHAHAHAAAAAH!  i need a vacation.  i need some silence.  i was trying to concentrate earlier and couldn't.  the printer was printing, some people were talking... and i realized that i have no time alone.  i have no time of nothingness, where it's just me, myself, and i...  i'm either at work, or at home with my roommate, or with friends, or at a coffeeshop filled with people... maybe i should go home for a weekend since my parents aren't there.  a nice quiet, silent weekend.  it would be nice.  i'll think about it.  alright, my brain is fried, i'm outtie.

      Ah yes, the institution which is Superbowl Sunday.  I watched the testosterone flowing from everything around me, from the TV, the beer, the players, the audience... the commercials on the TV in Toronto were Canadian, unfortunately.  but after the halftime show, who was even thinking about the commercials?!!    i love Janet Jackson.  i’ve loved her since i was 10 years old and i have Rhythm Nation on tape.  so when she started singing Rhythm Nation i was super excited.  then Justin Timberlake came on stage and J, B, and I started discussing their past love affair... and then it happened.  i was sure she was wearing some sort of nipple protector, i was sure it wasn’t so.  one of my idols, a pop music icon, was pulling a sad publicity stunt!!  she was sinking low to the level of Britney and Madonna!!  not only that, but trying to make some sort of artistic statement during the most chauvenistic event of the year!!!  Janet, NO!!  but now, apparently, she wasn’t trying to make a statement.  it was all a mistake, it was all a surprise, and everyone is very sorry that you had to see Miss Janet’s boobie.  because we’re all so sad that we got to see her boobie on teevee.  we’re so sorry, children of America!    that said, 3 things:  1) "i'm gonna have you naked by the end of this song."  2)  urlLink MTV News headline : "Janet Jackson Making Sexiest Album Yet, Producer Says"  3) it's freaking Janet naked-all-the-time Jackson.  are we really surprised??  maybe we're not surprised.  maybe we think it just wasn't the time or place.  ug.  all i know is, is that before she did that, i was sitting around a bunch of guys who were saying that she was wearing too much clothes, and i was proud of her for wearing whatever the hell she wanted.  i was proud and thought of her as a role model because even during a very male-oriented event, she was wearing pants, and sleeves, and nothing was see-through...  i was proud because during this church-of-macho event filled with beer commercials featuring french-kissing girls to half-time bra&panties football, Janet Jackson was singing for peace and an end to racism.  "With music by our side To break the color lines Let's work together To improve our way of life Join voices in protest To social injustice A generation full of courage Come forth with me People of the world today Are we looking for a better way of life We are a part of the rhythm nation..."  so was it planned?  was it a "costume mishap"?  either way, today i am a little sad for women everywhere.    i sat down to watch football last night, hoping to understand the game i had always thought was a little pointless.  i understand now, the yards and the downs, and i even found it exciting... but i can't help thinking that the show last night, from the commercials to Miss Janet, brought women back to a place and time where we should demand the vote.  if i didn't know it before:  we live in a time where women are nothing but sex toys.  i am woman, hear me deflate.  and to you gentlemen reading, you might think that yes, some women are playthings, sex toys, blow-up dolls... and it makes me sad that you don't realize how little that makes all of us.  and when women start to make men their play-sex-things, i feel like we're lowering ourselves to their level.  there i go again, little naive maria, all riled up over nothing!  i won't apologize for being female.  i won't apologize for being a little offended by the events surrounding the Superbowl last night.  i won't apologize and i won't expect anyone else to apologize.    i still love Janet Jackson --  urlLink boobie and all  -- and i'll keep hoping that objectifying women will become a thing of the past, something giggled about and laughed at, as though we can't believe we actually did that.

      ARGH! freakin furgin fre... mumble mumble...   who asked you anyway??!!    so my "other" boss saw my logos... "well, see, me and my business partner had this vision of what our logo should look like..."  k, i designed the BEST LOGO EVER for that store, and he's like, "we had a vision" -- not, "maria, this is awesome -- these are some great ideas!!"  no.  "we had a vision."  ya, well, i designed these for free, so your vision can be systematically shoved up your a*-- calming down now.  i already tried his vision.  the logo they had in mind was in my early stages of sketching and was discarded early due to its' illegibility.  BUT HEY!  WHAT DO I KNOW?!  faaaaaaaaack.  so i'm gonna design their ugly design and they're gonna love it, or HOPEFULLY, they'll see that what they have in mind just won't work and we can get back to MY FABULOUS designs.    Graphic design would be great if i didn't have to deal with people.  Life in general would be great if i didn't have to deal with people.  PEOPLE SUCK.  except the people that agree with that statement, which is most of my friends and family!  they only suck occasionally.  occasionnaly.  oc.. i can't spell today.   breathe in.... breathe out... phew!!  i have to quit this job.  not this one i'm at right now... good god no, they're paying me way too much money, but my "other" job, has to go.  at least the stupid secretarial stuff.  i hate doing that crap.  calling people, making appointments, entering data, writing letters... bleurk -- BOOOOORING.  i don't particularly like  people ... why on earth did i think secretary jobs would be my forté??  i've always been a little frustrated with the need to have a "calling" in life.  i'm not particularly great at anything, but i'm good at a lot of things.  it's practical because i'm versatile, but i get bored quickly and there’s always someone who’s better than me - an inferiority complex that i probably get from being the youngest in a very talented and intelligent family.  I then went on to surround myself with beautiful people, people who got more attention than i did, although i managed to steal the spotlight a few times in my short life, especially in my last year of highschool.  every now and then i’ll get this burst of energy and stamina - i’ll want to save the world, write a book, change my life... this is not one of those days.  I just want to travel.  Everything in me is geared towards that goal.  It’s a good goal to have.  I’m afraid that part of me thinks i’ll have some sort of epiphane abroad, like the world will come together and whisper my destiny into mine ear – “maria...thou shoudst...” and it will all make sense.  Whenever i go shoe shopping, or shopping for anything at all really, movies, clothes, – in any situation where i have to pick, i tend to trust my instincts.  Instincts are a very strong super power people tend to underestimate.  When i go shoe shopping, to come back to my example, sometimes i’ll just walk around a store looking quickly, waiting for something to catch my eye.  Often, nothing will catch my eye but i’ll try a random pair on, not like them only to have the saleslady/guy ask, “What do you think of this pair?” and have them suggest a pair i hadn’t seen which is totally perfect.  I guess it’s about being open to the unexpected (the shoe example being a little simple, but still) – it’s about letting the “powers that be” guide your choices.  If you are open, there are available signs to follow.  i need some more signs.  Am i supposed to keep at graphic design?  Am i any good?   In my graphic design class i was in the top 3 – but i told myself that "they let anyone into that school".  I was the best of the worst, nothing to be proud of.  Nothing to be proud of.  i’m not really proud of anything i’ve done.  There’s nothing i really “worked hard” for and was rewarded for.  People always seem to “reward” me (not sure if reward is the right word) for things i do that come easily to me.  They thank me for the little things.  I was a busy bee in highschool, organizing summer theatre with Gigi... we laughed!  So much fun... we would teach these kids starting at 8 or 8:30am... they would leave around noon or 1pm... we would just lay on the stage after they left, giddy and tired.  There was this one kid who had ADD, and he would come in at 8am with a can of Coke in his hands, God help us.  The next year that same kid came, but he was wiser and knew when he needed to sit out an activity to calm down – it was strange.  i hope we made those kids feel proud of themselves.  They did a really really good job.  So i guess i’m proud of that, of them.  But there are so many things that i tried and failed at.  Everyone has, i imagine.  My so-called “underground” highschool paper that turned out to be more of a propagandist pro-school paper... i was so dissapointed.  All the highschool plays i participated in that didn’t go very far in competitions – except “Ainsi soit-il” the play that Gigi wrote where i played this depressed mother that lost her husband in a fire.  That play rocked.  We never even entered it in a competition.  I dropped out of University, bored to tears and feeling that my choice of trying to be an actor was a bad one.  I still wonder what would have happened had i gone to Ryerson for journalism instead.   ah spring -- the eternal conflict between the sun and grey clouds, hope and despair, the new heat and lingering cold...  keep the faith maria... summer is almost here... take time, do what you gotta do -- do not heed the comments of others, for you are the one assuming their negative conotations...   breathe in.... breathe out....

      *  Bonjour les amis!  Dans ce poste, I will attempt to use my best Frenglish.  Je suis talented quand ça vient au biliguisme.  I think.  Some people, or rather, unilingual people sont surpris quand je switch d’une langue à l’autre, without even thinking about it. But normally, the switch occurs either at a comma, comme maintenant, ou lorsque je ne peux me souvenir du bon mot.  Like once, I was trying to describe the toppings on a pizza to my cousine in Montreal: “Est-ce qu’il y a des red peppers?”   des quoi?  I bought Paulo Coelho's Eleven Minutes -- hard cover 40$ ouch.  never did spending so much on a book feel so good.  and from leaving it out on my desk I discovered that another girl in my office quite enjoys his books, and lent me the one i hadn’t read yet, La Cinquième Montagne or The Fifth Mountain.  VERY EXCITED!!  Not much else to report.  I slyly placed some logos i thought up on my “other” bosses desk last night.  Hopefully he’ll like them.  I was thinking last night (a beautiful night) how shitty shitty crap crap it’s gonna be to work 2 jobs all summer.  I have to keep reminding myself that it might be crappy now, but it’ll be great when i go to Europe and have some money to spend.  D gave me a great budgeting idea!!  Something i think i can actually do!!!  I’m the WORST budgeter EVER.  She suggested (from experience) when her husband got paid once a month and she wasn’t working, they would take all the money they were thinking of spending during the month and divide into different envelopes: Groceries, Phone Bill, Gas Money, Dinner Out, Visa, Rent, etc.  When the money was gone from Dinner Out, there were no more dinners out, and when they had extra money left over say, from Gas Money, then they could spend it on going out, or pay for something else, or save it... that could work for me.  I’ll really need to make a very comprehensive and complete list though.  Anyway, i’d better go – it was crappy grey outside this morning and i couldn’t get up to go to the gym, so i promised myself i would go to work early (which i did, only to be unable to work due to network connection problems!!) and then go to the gym for a half hour after work.  Which is what i’m going to do right now.  Ciao bellos and bellas!!

      * first: Cecilia Zhang, the 9-year-old who disappeared what seems like ages ago,  urlLink was found dead in a wooded area in Mississauga ...  My heart goes out to her parents and i hope the police find the guilty party – she was kidnapped from her room in late October... it must’ve been horrible.  She laid in the ground, under a shrub, all through the fall and winter... she would turn 10 tomorrow.  On Friday I had a major thank-you session with God/The Powers That Be.  i'm not sure if it's karmic or pure luck or statistical, but my family, my friends and i haven't suffered any violent loss or been victim to any kind of violent crime.  no one (that i know of) has been raped, no one murdered.  no one has been kidnapped, no one sexually abused.  thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you.  i walk home, late at night, and try to be brave.  try not to look nervous, try to walk as fast as i can.  "be safe!" walk in lighted areas, don't walk alone, take public transportation -- ask the driver to let you off on your corner... so many precautions.  don't make eye contact, learn self-defense.  carry pepper-spray, carry a cell-phone... always let someone know where you are, when you'll be home, where you're going.  when i was in residence, i spent a few days with a friend -- i got back to residence and a girl-friend gave me shit for not calling her to let her know i wouldn't be back for a few days.  she got worried.  when do you file a missing persons report for someone who's known for going missing?  there's no ONE person who knows where i am ALL the time.  i frequent different circles, meet new people all the time.  what if i were to go missing?  would anyone miss me?  i guess if i missed work someone would notice.  but when?  these thoughts go through my head.  i think of them and i am so grateful that i haven't had to live through it.  i hope i never will.  i keep saying to myself that as long as i am grateful, as long as i count my lucky stars, it won't ever happen to me.  as long i imagine that every guy i pass at 3am on my way home is a potential threat, i'll never be attacked.  i hate that i have to think like this.  i hate having to be on my guard.  at least i don't let it affect what i do, where i go.  i was raised with 2 brothers and i'll be damned if fear will prevent me from doing something a boy can.  that said, i don't put myself in positions where i'm terrified.  regardless, things happen to the best of people -- accidents, unforseeable events... i'm grateful - i'm lucky - let's just leave it at that.  not much else to report.  had a nice weekend - went clubbing!  i haven't been out in a while.  the Guest List line up was really long... so we did something really dumb and tried to sneek in... only to get caught by a bouncer.  who then said that we wouldn't be allowed in.  i was like, um, excuse me, you're not going to let us in because we tried to get in free somewhere where we were going to be let in free?  we just didn't want to wait in line to go through your stupid frisking when i ain't carrying any weapons and i'm not bringing in any drugs.  not even a joint.  nothing.  but the bouncer's threat was empty and we ended up gaining a little noteriety from the kids in line with us - "hey! you're the guys who tried to sneak in!  i can't believe they let you in! that's awesome..."  ya ya.   1) i don't PAY to get into System - which is why i was on the guest list. 2) i DON'T wait in line.  no party is worth waiting in line for, unless it's Richie Hawtin, or maybe Mark Oliver, maybe.  maybe.  apart from the adrenaline rush of getting caught doing something you're not supposed to, the night was pretty normal.  a little dancing, a few cigarettes... System was renovated, they did a good job.  they were spinning Jungle in the basement room, which was a welcome change.  the basement room is WAAAY too small, and i didn't have any room to dance which just pisses me off.  we left early, around 3am.  chalk it up to getting old.  there was a time i could go to a club sober and stay til 6 or 7.  those were the days when i could nap.  i'd get to the club, get really tired around 4am, find a spot on the couch where i could rest my head, sleep for an hour (maybe?) then i'd get my second wind and out-dance even the druggies.  unless the party was just boring.  but now-a-days the bouncers (i'm gonna start disliking bouncers) they don't let you keep your eyes closed for more than 5 minutes.  tap tap tap, "no sleeping."  fack you.  i'm tired.  but i guess once someone O.D.'s they don't like to see anyone sleeping.  so my system doesn't work anymore.  now i have to nap BEFORE i go.  who has time to nap pre-party??  especially on a Friday.  i get home from work at 8pm.  i eat.  i have a beer and it's already 10pm.  then i have to change.    Saturday is a different story i guess.  but i was having fun playing on my computer... i didn't want to stop... and then i had a helluva time trying to find the perfect outfit.  but i did and i looked AWESOME.  so stylin'.  and i got to wear my new shoes.  very comfy -- i have too many shoes.  i don't wear a lot of them though.  i'll have to go through them and throw some out.  what a travesty!!!  speaking of shoes, i watched the last episode of Sex and the City last night... sigh... the end of an era.  go Samantha!  it was a good ending.  i hear talk of a SATC movie.  god i love that show.  the last epiodes made me want to go to Paris SO BAD!!!  if only i could stay in such a swanky hotel.  oh well.  i gotta lunch.  i'm starving... oh oh!! I'M STARVING BECAUSE... ::::  i woke up at 5:30 this morning, had breakfast, AND WENT TO THE GYM!!! i'm so proud of myself i could scream.  eeek!  it didn't even hurt that much.  although my coffee was needed earlier than usual.  i feel fine.  except that i'm starving right now.  and i gotta pee.

      You may have heard, since it is on the news from CTV to CNN, from Mississauga to Philadelphia: Porn Star Taylor Summers (real name Natel King) was found in the woods in Philadelphia, on Wednesday.  She worked for the agency I work at part-time.  She hadn't signed a contract because she wanted to be able to freelance... porn stars make more money when they freelance since they don’t have to pay their agent a cut.  So she advertized her services on the Internet and got a call from this photographer in Philadelphia to do a shoot in early March.  She knew the shoot was going to be a bondage one, and she had done them before.  She travelled alone in her red Saturn down into the States.  During the photoshoot she called her roommate to say that she felt weird about the guy taking the pictures, “Are you afraid they won’t pay you? Or that they’re gonna kill you?” he asked jokingly. “I dunno,” she answered. “Both.  I can’t really talk now, there’s people around.  I’ll call you back in 5 minutes, ok?”  He never heard from her again.  They found her body in a wooded area, wrapped in a photographer’s backdrop, wearing almost nothing, with a red-ball gag in her mouth, straps tied behind her head.  She had been stabbed repeatedly in the neck and chest.  Police have arrested the photographer and his assistant.  They say she fought, she had defensive wounds on her hands.  I wonder what went through her head when someone pulled out a knife, unable to speak, I wonder if she cried.  The photographer was a sick fuck and was taking snuff pictures of this 23 year-old girl.  Sick. Fuck.  I wonder if he got off, if he enjoyed it.  She was taking psychology classes by correspondence, paying for her tuition by doing some adult modelling, no big deal, she thought.  Another porn star had told her that it was dangerous travelling alone, no big deal, she thought, I do this all the time.  My boss has been doing interviews constantly: Globe & Mail, Toronto Star, Toronto 1, CTV, CNN... “She was a very sweet girl,” he says, “but not very street smart.”  My boss will check references, verify business licenses, go take a look at the location... she had just gone to get a job.  I can’t imagine what her parents must be going through.  I’d hate to be in her roommate’s head – he must feel aweful, being the last one to have talked to her.  I can’t imagine having someone I love die, but having them die because they were murdered must just be the worst.  Knowing that someone has pictures of her dying is disgusting.  Rest In Peace Natel.  There are no university debts where you are... what a waste.  Thank god my parents paid for my tuition...

      I saw Bruce Cockburn at a restaurant last night.  I wanted to go up to him and say, "hey! my brother got you to autograph an album for me for Christmas!  He saw you at the Indigo in Montreal!  thanks!"  except i haven't really listened to the album yet, and i would've looked like an idiot had he asked me anything about my favourite song or which album i had.  also, i didn't want to bother him as he was having dinner...  i saw it as a sign and i brought the album to work today.  i'll listen to it later.  G, i want you to respond to my posts because i haven't really learned to form an opinion on anything.  in our family, not sure if you noticed, but this is the way i feel about it, i've learned to get the information in one ear and out the other because no one's really gonna care what i think anyway.  there's no "discussion" no "reparté"... I've just always kind of watched everyone talked and never really bothered to try and stand for anything.  I think it's funny you called me a dreamer, if that's what you're calling me.  right away John Lennon came into my head, "You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one... I hope some day you will join us, and the world can live as one..."  I can't help but think that there are solutions to our problems, that somewhere, somehow there are peaceful means to avoid war and the killing of innocent by-standers.  The vomiting blood image is a great one at 9am, thanks.  Maybe individual countries shouldn't have armies, maybe they should all be UN armies, a platoon for each country, spreading the wealth...  I'm pissed at the UN because they SHOULD have armies at their disposal so that they can fill their mandate.  seems to me that that is a given.  you can't expect an organization like the UN to keep the peace without an army that would make any dissident shit his/her pants -- which is why the US should not have made a move without the UN's backing.  The US's "coalition of the willing" is a joke, you must admit that much.  Most countries that signed up for it did so to avoid the wrath of the US -- like dangling a treat infront of a poodle.  I think the US, right now, has a right-wing that does have a f*cked up view of world peace.  they are biggots and they are greedy.  Greedy Biggots.  All you Realists can go colonize Mars.  We Dreamers will clean up the Earth and bring peaceful resolutions to our problems.  and no one would ever overthrow my gov't.  EVER. :)  "Realists are conservative because they figure why try changing what can't really change. They argue that in this day and age things are pretty comfortable for the human being so why fix it when it isn't broken. Sure you can fiddle here and there with pracitcal details, but no revolution is needed or desired. It would just cause more headaches."  Are you serious?  Do you agree with this statement, or are you just saying that some people think like this?  I'm not exactly sure if something's broken... i walked to work today without a gas mask on and without fear of being bombed.  i have a lunch in my bag that has vegetables and relatively cancer-free meat.  But when, like you said, somewhere governments are killing their citizens through genocides and diseases... mmm cyanide... something definately needs fixing.  When millions of people are dying of Aids in Africa and pharmaceutical companies  won't  offer aid by lowering the prices of these drugs, something needs fixing.  Sure, it doesn't really affect me, i'm comfortable at night, i watch my Law&Order, eat my Swiss Chocolate and go to bed under my warm duvet... so you're right, i shouldn't complain that Bush is killing people in Irak when the people in North Korea need more help.  I'm not against armed interventions, i'm against the reasons behind them.  The attacks on Irak where justified by inexistant reasons.  Greedy Biggot reasons.  I'm sure if Bush had said, we're going to Afghanistan, then we're going to North Korea, the response would have been different.  I'm sure if he had said, "The Free-Nations of this world have a duty to the citizens of this planet who are being oppressed!" There would have been a different response.  Jesus would be LIVID.  i don't imagine he's getting much sleep.  although, his dad probably told him the outcome of all this.  in the grand scheme of things, this is a spec of dust in God's vacuum cleaner.  I think Jesus would be turning over Bingo tables in Church basements and saying, "my church was meant to be united, not dissected into millions of pieces!  Get Mel Gibson on the phone..."  I think Jesus knew how to kick ass -- more importantly i think Jesus knew WHEN to kick ass.  Anyway, I need coffee and I really have to get some work done...

      argh!  k, there's this girl at work that i can't STAND!!!  she's the inconsequential girl who said, "WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR HAIR?!" when i cut it, the kind of girl who has a voice that makes you want to punch her in the head.  she brings out violent thoughts in me i thought i reserved only for my brothers. (no, no, i love my brothers, but sometimes, they frustrate me so much i want to punch them in da head!)  So now, i can't help thinking to myself: why does this girl bug you so much?  there must be a reason.  she doesn't remind me of anyone... and if i could pinpoint what it is that really gets on my nerves about her, i'd be one step ahead.  i was hoping that writing about it would open some doors, spread some light on the subject, but apparently not.  argh  in other news, the US Commission on the 9/11 attacks is underway... although i don't think they'll find out anything too too interesting.  what i do find interesting however, is the lack of response from my brother on that last post.  hello?  hello?!  it's like going on and on for 20 minutes only to find out the other person's phone cut out.  anyway, i need to get to work, so... ciao!

      My brother, darling brother, wrote this in the last comments... really, i didn't need this at 8:30am on a Monday... so FRUSTRATED with it, i need to address is now before i start my day, so that i can breathe a little... but i'm sure i'll come back later with a "AND ANOTHER THING!" kind of an entry...  so go read the entry after this one and gb's comments and then come back here.  G, i woulda expected something like this from my other brother... i'll pray for you... :)  you'll find my comments in  ITALICS  in gb's post here:  «"Don't lie to us, don't get us involved in a "war" that could, in this day and age, be resolved by other means... peaceful means."  That's a nice sentiment, maybe you could explain how that could happen in concrete terms.    don't mind if i do.    If I were King of the World, by Maria Buscemi: -- insert flowery music here --  First, the UN (which i would also be Queen/King of) would create its own  coalition of the willing  and would assemble experts and leaders from the countries involved.  At the moment, it's the middle east vs. USA, INCLUDING:  Afghanistan, Irak, Saudi Arabia, Iran, USA, etc, plus the usual parties involved in the UN.  Now, i'm sure Ossama and Saddam wouldn't have shown up for these talks, but i should hope that the UN knows who to include (i.e.: who would be better suited to be running Irak... as i'm sure the US also knows, as they must have "intelligence" on the subject).    then, i would give the involved groups a deadline, say, 1 week, to come up with ideas on how to seek and destroy Al Qaida, and overthrow the Irakie government. (i've decided Irakie looks cuter spelled like that, but i'm not sure if it's right.  Irakie.  Iraky.  Irakey.  Irakee.  teehee).  ahem.  This homework would have to include (in 20 pages or less, as a single spaced, one-sided document):  - the reasons they think Al Qaida hates the US/theWest and is attacking them - the ways of appeasing Al Qaida - or if there is no way of appeasing Al Qaida, then the most efficient ways of combatting them - identifying ALL of the countries/groups/governments associated with this threat, the extent of their associations, the reasons for these associations, and the influence these associations create.  Do these associations affect the relationship between enemy parties? (i.e.: providing of weapons, drug trafficking, etc.)  i would also assign people to each UN involved group that would have been trained by myself to be a mediator in each group discussion and to make sure that everyone was doing their homework properly, without doctoring documents, with embellishing anything (that looks like a weapon of mass destruction to me!  does that look like a weapon of mass destruction to you?)  After this week, the UN would assemble and i would give them another deadline.  share your findings and we'll come back in a week and discuss some more.   now, i know this sounds like a lot of talk and no action... hm... ok.  post 9/11, the UN comes to me and says, "Maria!  look at the towers in New York!  Al Qaida crashed into them!"  "argh," i would answer, "didn't the US receive the same reports that I received?  get me Bush on the phone.  what a jack-ass."  ring ring.  "Queen Buscemi, Bush is on the phone.  I'll connect you."  Bush: I'm hiding at my ranch, what do you want!!?? Buscemi: How did you let those planes hit the twin towers? Bush: I dunno. Buscemi: Are you an idiot? Bush: um... i dunno. Buscemi: How did Al Qaida get into the cockpits of those planes? Bush:  urlLink um... i think the FAA, or was it us?... anyway, we refused to pass legislation to secure cockpits in case of terrorist attacks...  Buscemi: Again, are you an idiot? Bush: it's not my fault! Buscemi: Well, what are you gonna do about it? Bush: probably blow them up... oo! maybe after we can blow up Irak! Buscemi: ug... well, address your people and get back to me. Bush: do i have to address them NOW?! Buscemi: yes, now. Bush: Ah man! Buscemi: Alright, let me get my UN peace group together to see how we let this happen.  Just don't nuke anybody til i get back to you. Bush: ok, well, i'm gonna go back to bed now.  See, i think the UN leaders need more balls.  No other reprise happened post 9/11 (at least not in the next few weeks before troops were sent to Afghanistan), so maybe no immediate attack/action needed to be taken?!  Let the UN gather information for a week, find the information you already have, and get back to me.  unfortunately, i don't know everything the governments knew, or what the UN knew, so i can't make very precise suggestions... but think, then ACT, do something for chrissake!  don't just let the US do it on their own...   BTW, the UN wasn't created to 'avoid' the 3rd world war, it was created to fight it, against the USSR.  (Back in the USSR, you don’t know how lucky you are booooy... Back in the USSR...)  The cold war is the 3rd world war according to George Tenet, the head of the CIA. The war vs. terrorism is the 4th world war.  (So many WW's, so little time...)  Also, see  urlLink www.un.org  for more information on the UN and its' mandate, i'll post some of the information i found below.   But I get your point, that the 3rd world war (the nuclear war) has so far been avoided, but for how long? You think al-qu'aida  (so many ways of spelling that groups' name!! Al Qaida, Al Qaeda, Al-Qu'aida...)  will hesitate if they get their hands on a suitcase nuke?  no, i don't think they would hesitate.  What happens after they use it?   urlLink bad things happen...   What do you propose.  let me think about it.  Wouldn't you rather avoid that?  yes.  Now if you're willing to say: let them nuke NY, then we'll apologize to them, then we'll institute some form of  urlLink Shar'ia Law  in the West to render us more compatible with Middle-eastern culture. If you want to appease these people, that's your (personal) choice, but as a president would you be ready to make that choice for the people you govern? Or do you think that this whole crazy system of presidents, armies, should go by the wayside and we should all be able to live 'peacefully' by abiding to a 'fundemental' and inclusive Law that doesn't 'discriminate' or piss off anybody at anytime.....»    Vote for Maria as Queen of the World! G, you can be my Prime-Minister...   brain... imploding... tooooo much....  thinking.... (god have mercy on my soul... tell my story... oh, J, i'm still laughing at that one.)  k, um, this thing is gonna eat up my entire day.  i've been working on this for 3 hours now.  well, the more i think about it, the more i'm pissed at the UN and not at the States.  although, don't get me wrong, Bush still bugs the crap outta me.  the UN is being very complacent about this whole situation. here's what the UN's website says about their mandate:  WE THE PEOPLES OF THE UNITED NATIONS DETERMINED  to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which  twice  in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind,  and  to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, and  to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, and  to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,  AND FOR THESE ENDS to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours, and   to unite our stength to maintain international peace and security, and  to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods,  that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest,   and  to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples,  HAVE RESOLVED TO COMBINE OUR EFFORTS TO ACCOMPLISH THESE AIMS Accordingly, our respective Governments, through representatives assembled in the city of San Francisco, who have exhibited their full powers found to be in good and due form, have agreed to the present Charter of the United Nations and do hereby establish an international organization to be known as the United Nations.   Article 1 The Purposes of the United Nations are: 1. To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace;  2. To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace;  3. To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion; and  4. To be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends.   Article 2 The Organization and its Members, in pursuit of the Purposes stated in Article 1, shall act in accordance with the following Principles.  1. The Organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members.  2. All Members, in order to ensure to all of them the rights and benefits resulting from membership, shall fulfill in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the present Charter.  3.  All Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered.   4.  All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.   5. All Members shall give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the present Charter, and shall refrain from giving assistance to any state against which the United Nations is taking preventive or enforcement action.  6.  The Organization shall ensure that states which are not Members of the United Nations act in accordance with these Principles so far as may be necessary for the maintenance of international peace and security.  Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter; but this principle shall not prejudice the application of enforcement measures under Chapter Vll.  I believe that one day, perhaps a far away day, armies will be useless and the human condition will be a peaceful one.  I guess you could say, I have a dream.  I leave you with words from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoken at the end of the Vietnam war... Dr. King, we need you now more than ever... who will step up and honour your memory??  «... Our only hope today lies in our ability to recapture the revolutionary spirit and go out into a sometimes hostile world declaring eternal hostility to poverty, racism, and militarism.   We must move past indecision to action. We must find new ways to speak for peace in Vietnam and justice throughout the developing world, a world that borders on our doors. If we do not act we shall surely be dragged down the long, dark and shameful corridors of time reserved for those who possess power without compassion, might without morality, and strength without sight.   Now let us begin. Now let us re-dedicate ourselves to the long and bitter, but beautiful, struggle for a new world. This is the calling of the sons of God, and our brothers wait eagerly for our response. Shall we say the odds are too great? Shall we tell them the struggle is too hard? Will our message be that the forces of American life militate against their arrival as full men, and we send our deepest regrets? Or will there be another message, of longing, of hope, of solidarity with their yearnings, of commitment to their cause, whatever the cost? The choice is ours, and though we might prefer it otherwise we must choose in this crucial moment of human history.»  Amen Dr. King, amen.

      G sent me this link:  http://www.davidwarrenonline.com/Comment/Mar04/index205.shtml  copy and paste, cuz i'm lazy this morning and haven't had my coffee yet.  if you skip to the bottom of the article as i did (half way through cuz i wanted to see which newspaper this jerk works for) (Oh. MY. GOD. -- the Ottawa Citizen??!!)  to sum up the text crudely, this guy says that Spain, in electing this new government, is surrendering to Al-Qaida, giving them what they want.  he compares this "war" to WW2 where all of Europe, save Britain, had capitulated to Germany.  Is this really our WW3??  He (David Warren) calls the UN:  "... the incompetent United Nations." ?!  didn't the United Nations begin after the second WW?  To prevent a WW3??!  I think a terrorist attack before the presidential election in the States would HELP Bush, not hinder him.  Who wants a president who is going to give in to these terrorists who have hit your country twice??!  this is America we're talking about here.   Once, ok, you put a couple planes into some buildings in New York, we'll hunt you down and send a bunch of soldiers to your country.  Most of our people won't be happy about it, but they'll grow to understand.  If you attack my country again... Senator Kelly had better come up with something spiffy to say cuz otherwise Bush's Eye for an Eye will look mighty tempting.  Spain didn't want to participate in this "war" in the first place.  Neither did most Americans.  Problem is, America has become almost complacent about its participation in this "war".  A lot of people who disagreed have come over to Bush's side... A lot?    k, maybe i'm talking out of my ass, but i don't think that Kelly or Bush will win this upcoming election by a landslide.  The difference is that Spain to this day, even the day before 3/11 didn't want to be in the "war".  What 3/11 did was let the government blame it on ETA, which might have helped them win the election.  when it was discovered that Al Qaida was actually responsible for the attacks, the Spanish people were a little pissed that Jose Maria Aznar had lied and accused ETA.  Don't lie to us, don't get us involved in a "war" that could, in this day and age, be resolved by other means... peaceful means.  But is Spain "surrendering" to Al-Qaida by electing this new prime minister??  No.  The Spanish just think, as the Canadians do (except maybe Mr. Warren), that these problems can/could be resolved in another way - a peaceful way.  I wish José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero the best of luck as Spain's new Prime Minister.  I hope their boys come home safely.  you know, i'm really getting tired of this warmongering.  HEY! we don't agree with how they're living!  let's blow them up!  let's "free" their people! (but we'll kill a lot of them doing it...)  argh.  k, changing the subject!!   urlLink I FOUND THE LAST UNICORN ON DVD!!!   see, i'm a little more awake, i can actually be bothered with linking something...  so i'm gonna buy it, and wait patiently for the live action version to come out... patiently patiently patiently...

      a guy at work just said that when i speak french, my voice is considerably lower and i sound like a french lumberjack.  !!?? WHAT THE HELL IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN ?!!  ??  so now i have the I'm a Lumberjack, Monty Python song in my head.  oh, but he said, when i made a strange face at him, "i mean that in best of ways."   um, ok, you can go back to work now.  Happy St-Patrick's Day by-the-way.  Make sure to drink a pint of Guinness today.  it should be called Guinness day, shouldn't it?  i went to Indigo at lunch time, as i always do, to paruse and read a bit... and dream of days when i can afford to buy hard-cover copies of beautiful books.  i pictured in my head this beautiful library in my house where i would spend hour upon hour reading these great books:    The Chronicles of Narnia, the books of  urlLink Roald Dahl  (James and the Giant Peach, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), Victor Hugo's books (Les Misérables, Le Bossu de Notre-Dame),  urlLink George Orwell's books  (I've read 1984, but not Animal Farm or any other of his for that matter),  urlLink Leo Tolstoy's masterpieces  (Anna Karenina, War & Peace), the Harry Potter books, all of  urlLink Douglas Coupland's books  (keeping up to him so far -- so brilliant, that man...),  urlLink Paulo Coelho  (obviously -- it would be nice to have hard-covers of his books),  urlLink Jane Austen ,  urlLink Margaret Atwood , i've never read any Oscar Wilde (which seems to me a travesty)... ug, i could write a never ending list.  i could spend a lifetime reading good books...   The next book i'm going to read is The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle -- i remember watching the animation movie when i was a child... i loved that movie.  They're making a live action film of that book now.  the good thing is that the author has a hand in the script, as he did in the animation version.  one day i'll be able to afford these tons of hard-cover books... i'll be able to create a space where i can go read, in peace... for hours upon hours.  it will have a fridge and a bathroom, so that i don't have to leave for days if i don't want to... :)  Quotes on books:  Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking. Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955)  This paperback is very interesting, but I find it will never replace a hardcover book - it makes a very poor doorstop. Alfred Hitchcock (1899 - 1980)  Wear the old coat and buy the new book. Austin Phelps  The man who doesn't read good books has no advantage over the man who can't read them. Mark Twain (1835 - 1910)  Just the omission of Jane Austen's books alone would make a fairly good library out of a library that hadn't a book in it. Mark Twain (1835 - 1910) *notice that i want to read Jane Austen's books, but not Mark Twain's...  Be as careful of the books you read, as of the company you keep; for your habits and character will be as much influenced by the former as by the latter. Paxton Hood  To be a book-collector is to combine the worst characteristics of a dope fiend with those of a miser. Robertson Davies  Knowing I lov'd my books, he furnish'd me  From mine own library with volumes that  I prize above my dukedom. William Shakespeare (1564 - 1616), "The Tempest", Act 1 scene 2

      Hip Hip! HOORAY! Hip Hip! HOORAY! Hip Hip! HOORAY!  I am so proud of Spain.  Did everyone see the picture of the injured Spaniard voting in this week's election?  A thing of beauty.  Bombs strike and the people are like, "we didn't ask for this, this is bullshit, our government sucks, you guys are outta here."  THAT, my friends, is democracy.  i don't have much time to write, i actually have work to do today...  here's to hoping... one day, when the people speak, they will be heard.

      poor Spain.  that sucks.  i bet every big-city dweller was a little uneasy on their way to work this morning.  when asked if he thought it was Al-Qaida, President Bush simply waved and walked away.  what an idiot.  if you live in a rabbit hole and didn't catch the news last night or this morning, you can check out  urlLink the Guardian  for all the info.  it frightens me a little, this idea that people could decide to bomb Toronto's subway system and kill parents and friends on their way to work.  BOOM!  me and my roommate were standing on our balcony last night, and with our super view, we could see any plane crash into a building, any big explosion... we thought we should get a video camera and just set it up to leave it there.  every day, if nothing happened, we could just erase the tape and tape over it.    then when something happens we could sell the footage to the media.  chaching!$$  Spain was so undeserving of those bombings.  i mean, k, i know very little about Spain's political climate, but if i were Al-Qaida, i would bomb England before i bombed Spain!! (don't worry girl, you don't live in London)...  anyway -- so, i'm a little ticked off, because i told my "other" boss about the 6 month contract i was offered here, and i was anticipating him to start a conversation, forcing me to explain my ideas and my thoughts on the subject.  his response: Oh ya.  ARGH!!  Bought and finish that Paulo Coelho book called the Valkyries.  i'll probably read it again this weekend.  maybe i'll buy and read the Alchemist again.  that's a book i should own.  it's only 2pm and i don't have any work to do.  can't i just go??  i'm totally leaving early today -- it's friday!!  aren't i entitled?

      Feeling a little low.  (thank you for your wonderful drug! - oh! are you on it cancerboy? - no, but my parents are on it though, cuz my brother, was born, with his heart, on the outside of his body.)  ah, i feel better now.  nothing like a little Kids in the Hall reference to make my day brighter.  i dunno, i'm reading Margaret Cho's blog and she's freakin hilarious, and i'm reading Wil Wheaton's blog and he's witty and geeky and very eloquent (in a pop culture kind of way)... i guess i'm feeling a little silly.  anyway, enough about my silly self-esteem.  went to Indigo books yesterday at lunch and sat and read for an hour.  i'm reading a Paolo Coelho book called the Valkyries.  i'm enjoying it muchly and wish i didn't have to go back to work.  i'm debating buying it... but i'm almost done it, and want to spend my money on other things.  J bought me dinner last night at the Friendly Thai... mmm Seafood Pad Thai...  SO uninspired today.  yesterday i didn't even write, which is very weird for moi.  you'd think i'd have tons to say, but i don't.  still haven't talked to my "other" boss about just working part time and then going to Europe... not looking forward to that at all.  do i gotta??  ug.  ok, ok, i'll tell him tonight... sheesh!  i don't feel like writing today, so here's another Paolo Coelho thingy from his Warrior of the Light website:   Setting an example   Dov Beer de Mezeritch was asked: "Which example should one follow? That of pious men, who devote their lives to God? That of scholars, who seek to understand the will of the Almighty?  "The best example is that of the child," he answered. "A child knows nothing. It hasn't yet learned what reality is," people commented. "You are all quite wrong, for a child possesses three qualities we should never forget," said Dov Beer. "They are always joyful without reason. They are always busy. And when they want something, they know how to demand it firmly and with determination."   "If tomatoes wish to be melons they will become a farce.  I am amazed that so many people are busy  wanting to be what they are not; why become a farce?" Mitsuo Aida    Overcoming obstacles   A famous Sufi master was invited to give a course in California. The auditorium was full at 8AM - the time announced - when one of the assistants came onto the stage.  "The master is just waking up. Please be patient." Time passed, and people started leaving the room. At midday, the assistant returned to the stage, saying that the master would be starting the lecture the minute he finished talking to a pretty girl he had just met. Most of the remaining audience left. At 4PM the master appeared - apparently drunk. This time, all but 6 people stormed out. "I will teach you this," said the master, ceasing to act drunk. "Whoever wishes to go down a long path, must learn that the first lesson is to overcome early disappointments."   good day to you all...

      sigh...  Paolo Coelho literally rocks my world.  having been raised Roman Catholic (capital R capital C), i have a fundamental (if not shaky) belief in God; and being who i am, i have a fundamental need to learn more about the world and how i can be better in it.  if any of you cringe at the sight of the name "jesus" or get completly defensive at the sight of the word "GOD"... i'm warning you now that there are many places in Paolo Coelho's texts and stories where those words appear.  there are also the words, "Buddha", "Allah", "Monk", "Master"... etc.  These are simply words, letters strung together to form coherent ideas.  If these words still bother you, then go away.  i love you, but go away.  for the next couple weeks, i'll insert quotes from   urlLink Paolo Coelho's Warrior of the Light website , here are a couple:   I too am on the outside    In the parable of the Prodigal Son, the brother who always obeys his father is furious at seeing the rebel son received with celebrations and joy. In the same way, many people who are obedient to the Lord's word, end up becoming the merciless hangmen of all those who one day strayed from the Law. In a small village in the interior, a well-known sinner was barred from entering the church. He was angry and prayed:  "Jesus, hear me. They will not let me into your house, for they think I am not worthy." "Do not worry, my son," answered Jesus. "I too am on the outside, together with those I have always stood alongside - sinners like yourself."    Does the master not suffer with bad disciples?    A disciple asked Firoz: - The mere presence of a master causes all sorts of curious people to gather round, to discover something beneficial. Can't this be a hindrance and negative? Can't this divert the master from his path, or cause him to suffer because he could not teach that which he wished? Firoz, the Sufi master, replied: - The sight of an avocado tree laden with fruit whets the appetite of all those who pass by. If someone wishes to satisfy his hunger beyond his needs, he will eat more avocados than necessary, and will be sick. However, this causes no indigestion to the man who owns the avocado tree. It is the same with our Search. The path must be open to all; but it is for God to set the limits of each individual."   the first story makes me laugh.  in this day and age of using Jesus and God to justify hate and prejudice, it's nice for someone to remember that he was closest with the outcasts (or Outkast, i'm sure Jesus loves them too).  my job here has offered me another 6 month contract.  it's great because i really want to travel and this job pays well, but not so great since my boss at my "other" job expects me to start working for him full time soon.  i just want to travel.  so i have to talk to my other boss to see if i can still work part time for him... 2 jobs for the whole summer... i'm gonna have to start plastering my "office"/hardly-even-a-cubicle with pictures of the Eiffel Tower and Big Ben.    i have to get my house in order.  pay off my credit card (gasp!) so that i can have some money to spend in Europe, pay off my freaking TV so that i can stop paying that bill (and then i'll probably just end up selling it to my roommate or something)...  if i get a 6 month contract... that means i can leave in September.  this job is flexible enough that i can end my contract whenever i want, really.  as long as they know in advance... so i have to pick a date, hang up a calendar, and start crossing off the days with a big red marker.  i don't think my other boss will react well... but i can't be afraid of that -- Paolo Coelho talks a lot about living without fear.  this trip is a lot more important than that job.    i have to go to the gym tonight, i haven't been in over 2 weeks.    priorities...  one more paolo??   The moment to decide    The warrior of the light is terrified when faced with important decisions.  "That is too great for you," says one friend. "Go on, be brave," says another. And his doubts only increase. After some days of anxiety, he withdraws into a corner of his tent, where he usually sits to mediate and pray. He sees himself in the future. He sees the people who will benefit and lose out because of his actions. He does not wish to cause unnecessary suffering, but nor will he abandon the path. So the warrior allows the decision to appear. If he must say yes, then he shall bravely say it. If he must say no, then he shall say so without fear.

      -- i felt lonely this weekend.  lonely and undesirable.  i've rarely been the one to be flirted with, rather i watch as my friends flirt and as their eyes light up with the joy of falling every so slightly in love, even for a moment.  if i were the subject of affection, it was only for a fleeting moment, a make-out session, or a torid and horrible love-affair.  i watch my friends in relationships where they are challenged and happy - i am jealous.  i go home alone and dream of a day when i will be greeted by a small kiss on the forehead, "you look tired, let me make dinner"...  i went to a club on Saturday, a great new-ish club just near my house called Boa.  the crowd was good (and with quite a few straight boys, a welcome change) and i danced  more than i have in quite a while.  it was fun, and i went home pleased with my evening.  i am frustrated by the things i tell no one.  the things no one knows, except me.  this feeling deep inside that i am selling myself short of the things i could accomplish.  then the feeling that i am wrong, that i will never accomplish anything, since i am not that good at anything, i will always be mediocre.  i am impatient.  i have given myself years to find a route better suited to myself and i am angry within weeks.  i am frustrated with myself for not attaining goals i barely set.  i am tired and frustrated.  i seem to forget that it's a long trek from the bottom of the ocean.  i have debts i never intended on having, and wish i knew how to not spend money.  i have been working 2 jobs for the past 4 months and feel asthough i have nothing to show for it except that my rent is paid, my stomach is full, and my skin is tanned.  it's annoying actually, living in fear.  fear that i will end up broke and alone, all of my dreams hidden under my bed with the dust bunnies.  fear... it's crippling.  if only i knew what i wanted!  if only i could put a name to the goal of happiness that makes me heart sink.  if only i could schedule it, budget it, make it happen.  this unattainable bliss is just beyond my reach, i can touch it with my fingertips, scratch it with my nails... what IS IT??!!  come on... COME ON... a little closer...  i want to travel.  see things, experience things.  France, England, Italy, Spain.  if i haven't taken steps toward a "real job" it's because of this goal.  i keep forgetting.  you have no stable income right now because you want to skip town.  you have no money because you need to finish paying off debts as soon as possible.  so now i need to stop complaining and do what i need to do.  i need to forget myself in order to really learn who i am and what i am capable of.  i need to push ahead.  i need to realize one of my dreams before i truly believe that they are all obsolete and childish.  i have to stay honest and share my goals.  i wish to travel alone, even if i smile at the idea of reaching a sea of friendly faces across the pond.  my bank account sits empty, my landlord still awaits my cheque and my fridge could use some filling.  i wonder what i am doing wrong.  i would stop going out and having fun except i would like to keep these great friends that i have.  luckily J is moving away even though i cherish his friendship more than anything at the moment, i go out more than i should with him and spend a lot of money of booze with him... the end of an era, when he leaves...  i leave you with a quote by Paolo Coelho and thank  urlLink Mike Noakes  who inadvertantly reminded me of him.  " The cocoon        The great Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis ("Zorba the Greek") tells us that once when he was a boy he noticed a cocoon stuck to a tree, with a butterfly was about to be born. He waited a while, but it was taking so long, so he decided to warm the cocoon with his breath. The butterfly finally emerged but its wings were still stuck together and it died soon afterwards.      "I just couldn't wait for the sun to complete the necessary process of patient maturation," says Kazantzakis. "That small corpse is until this very day one of the heaviest burdens on my conscience. But that's what made me understand what a true mortal sin is: trying to force the great laws of the universe. We have to have patience, wait for the right time and then follow confidently the rhythm that God has chosen for our lives."  may we all have the grace of patience and the wisdom to be gentle.

      as i went outside this morning, the Madonna song, Rain, came into my head and it still hasn't left, even though i've spent a greater part of the day listening to Misstress Barbara.  (who rocks the rock rock, by the way)  i feel a little melancholic this afternoon.  i accomplished most of what i wanted to do today, and i don't have to go to my "other" job, so i think i'll go home and play on my computer.  i've been having fun on it of late, even though i don't have Photoshop anymore and my existenz suitcase is out of order.  damn-crack-software...  i wish i could afford to just buy them.  went out for Indian food last night with my best girl (who is on her way to England as i type) and another very good friend that i don't see half as much as i should.  we talked a lot about graphic design and art and underground stuff.  she thinks i should join the  urlLink Church of Craft .  i think i might.  i love crafts, knitting and the like.  it's fun, and it's productive.  it's better than watching TV, for sure.  this weekend will be funfilled.  planning on cleaning my room.  i mean CLEANING MY ROOM.  and maybe the kitchen floor too cuz it's kinda sticky.  ew.  nothing grosses me out more than stepping on something sticky whilest making toast in the morning.  ew.  i'm addicted to  urlLink Rufus Wainwright 's song "I don't know what it is" at the moment.  it's on repeat.  he'll be in Toronto in April.  i must check him out.  he'll be playing at the Phoenix, which is a good venue.  The Darkness were there... but the show was sold out.  i'm gonna just finish this work and head home.  home on the range.  in the rain.  what a pain.  merry weekend to all, and to all...

      OH MY!  There are so many scary things in the world... murderers, dictators... gays!!??  Why on EARTH are people making such a big deal over gays getting married?  Are heterosexuals really feeling THAT threatened?  Threatened by what??  Do homos really gross them out?  What exactly is the problem here?   urlLink Dan Savage of Savage Love (in Now Magazine)  devoted his column this week to talking to anti-gay-marriage people.  Is it really about reproduction?  In this day and age, when tons of kids are getting adopted, and tons are not, isn't it about love?  no, wait,  SHOULDN'T IT BE ABOUT LOVE??  Like, come ON people, can we ease up a little here?  i was gonna make a pickle up the ass comment, but that may be a little too *gay* for some people.    With advancement in genetics, maybe two guys or two girls WILL be able to have their own child.  Maybe guys will be able to lay their own little person.  Maybe they will be able to create a blank sperm, void of any genetic material, which will be able to be modified to have a girl's DNA!!  i've always wanted sperm... (k, no, i haven't, but you get the idea.)  Mr. Savage makes a good point when he says, "What makes them married – in their own eyes, and in the eyes of the state – is their love and commitment to each other, not their commitment to growing the population."  He also goes on to say that infertile people get married, people in jail for life are allowed to get married -- so the baby thing is out the window.  What other reason is there?  We're the only animals in nature that has *gays*, therefore, it must be terribly horribly WRONG.  Totally untrue.  So untrue i won't even get into it.  Any other reason gays shouldn't get married?  And another thing, what's with the people who say, "i wanna marry my shoe" or my dog or whatever.  um, i guess gays aren't human.  right?  when i see someone THAT STUPID i wanna PUNCH THEM IN THE HEAD.  punch punch.  :)  stoopids.  ah, i feel better now.  if you wanna see more people trying to do something about this very important human rights issue, check out :   urlLink www.freedomtomarry.org  (a great site about taking action and getting informed about the right to marry.  in Savage's column, he mentions that a lot of straight couples are putting freedomtomarry.com on their marriage registry list for donations.  those kinds of actions makes me proud to be straight.)  urlLink www.dearmary.com/mary  (a website devoted to Vice President Dick Cheney's lesbian daughter who has gone back in the closet since *daddy* has to save face, although Rush Limbarf would have you think different).   urlLink Margaret Cho has a lot to say about the issue too  (when does Margaret Cho NOT have a lot to say??!) and she is, as per usual, very eloquent about the whole shebang.   well, there was my rant on that!  next, John Kerry, you go boy! (avoid the American news reels like the plague... or the Chicken Flu...  urlLink check out the Guardian instead )  Lastly, since my best girl is leaving the country for the NEXT TWO YEARS!! (and i will be lost without her... k, maybe not, but, but... sob sob) my girls and I went for dinner last night.  I love those kids.  We can really talk about anything... from vibrators to diamond rings to having to poo...  it was fun.  I faked knowing wine (i love it when i get to pick the wine, and then the waiter puts a little in your glass so you can taste it like you know what you're doing!! so fun!!) we had some pizza (gourmet pizza, thank you very much) paid the bill and went back to S's... and watched Sex and the City (oh ya...)  In Canada we're only up to the episode where Samantha shaves her head.  GOD, SMITH IS GORGEOUS.    ok, i have to get a semblance of work done. be good kiddies.   God Bless Canada.

      Did this "what revolution are you?" quiz.  of course, i'm the hippy.      urlLink     urlLink What revolution are You?  Made by   urlLink     urlLink altern_active       i would have loved to have been at the original Woodstock.    peace, love and rock N' roll.  i went to see a comedy show with J last night.  he liked the hawaiian shirt i got him in Cancun for lending me his suitcase.  anyway, we went to this place called Clinton's (cuz it's on Clinton street near Christie subway station).  these kids were funny.  they made me go up for audience participation.  i laughed a lot.  speaking of funny... apparently, Bill Murray’s pissed he didn’t win the Oscar.  you know, more people should admit that they’re pissed they didn’t win the Oscar.  It's OK Bill!  We still love you!!  You still rock the party that rocks the party!  my foot is itchy and i'm wearing knee-highs.  itchy itchy!!!   i have a lot of work to do today... or this week rather.  i wish i could motivate myself to do it.  i'm gonna go get a coffee first, then i'll get to work.  haha.  i'm so funny.  i still haven't gotten a hold of my mum.  i was going to call my aunts house in Montreal... and then i realized that i haven't talked to them since i left Montreal in September.  i just kind of broke up with my boyfriend, packed up my shit and left, without saying goodbye to anyone.  i was afraid if i called that they’d ask me questions about my move.  I wasn’t in the mood for that conversation.  I just wanted to talk to my mommy.  my grandmother died at 93 years of age, after giving birth to 14 children (we calculated how much time of pregnancy that is - 10,5 years)... at the end she was pretty cranky - she was tired.  who wouldn't be?  she was very devout, so i'm sure she be chillin with Jesus and Mary, yelling at God for not taking her sooner.  ma chère grand-maman... je vais penser à toi à chaque fois que je vais voir un mot croisé dans le journal et lorsque je verrai ma mère et ses soeurs et frères...  i can't imagine losing my mother.  an eventuality i am not looking forward to.

      Ah yes work.  It's barely 10am and i'm already avoiding doing things.  What a great vacation.  i feel rested (albeit tired because my plane landed at 1am!) and ready to get my life in gear.  but first, i'ma gonna need some coffee.  well, being alone did me some good.  watched a lot of early morning TV ( urlLink yay Ellen!! so funny i could die ) and came to many a realization:  (cue birds chirping in the distance) i'm good enough i'm smart enough and gosh darnit, people like me.  nah, i'm just kiddin'.  i know how Sex and the City ends.  i think i've stopped caring whether i know or not... it'll still make me laugh and cry, whether or not i know what the end result will be.    i began to wonder why i was so adamantly against Carrie ending up with someone.  i was getting physically nervous about the whole situation.  Maria, it's just a TV show, calm down.  Carrie has become such an icon.  people relate to her.  people compare themselves to her.  her getting together with Big would mean that every girl who has an on-again-off-again relationship with someone would think that eventually they would end up together... and i didn't want any of my friends (or a certain friend in particular) to harbour any hopes.  then i saw an interview with Miss Sarah Jessica Parker on CNN (Larry King Live) where she said that the end of the series was a nod to the old movies where love triumphs over all... Maria, it's just a TV show, calm down!  i think i've stopped believing in love.  i don't think love triumphs over all, except maybe on TV and in the movies.  i guess i hadn't realized to what point my last relationship made me crazy.  i keep dreaming of this perfect guy: dresses well, watches Sex and the City, has a job he likes... (to dream the impossible dream...) and i can't help but realize that i may not meet him, that i may just meet a guy i think is... O... K... marry him because he is dependable, have children with him because we can afford to... and wake up 20 years later justifying it by thinking that it could have been worse.  i realize this and i keep hoping that i'm wrong.   i realize this and i need to stop thinking that all men are scum.    everywhere i turn it seems that someone is sleeping with someone they're not supposed to be sleeping with.  everytime i think of my ex boyfriend, i can't help but realize all the lies i fell for.  will i ever trust again?  will my next relationship be about "working through my issues"?  god.  i also realized that i need to quit a job.  this one.  i am so bored here i could die.  yes, they are paying me quite well, but at what expense?  i'll talk to my "other" boss tonight, and see what it is he can offer me full time.  this contract is up at the end of March anyway.  Summer is slowly but surely approaching.  it's warm out, the snow is almost all gone.  it'll snow again before March is through, but the worst is over.  the summer will soon be upon us.  this promises to be one of the best on record (knock on wood).  my roommate is getting on my nerves.  he's still not working, and is depressed as a result.  it's fine cuz his mom pays his rent and i don't have to worry about him, but he's home ALL THE TIME and i never get any time to myself.  when i got back he said, "i was getting used to living alone."  WELL TOO BAD BUDDY, this is my home too!  when he starts working things will be better... and i have to clean my room!  it's so disorganized.  now i have to do post-trip unpacking and cleaning...   when my dad's back in March, i'll get my bunkbed!! so exciting!!

      My heart is pounding and i wonder whether it’s the coffee or the impending trip to Montreal.  I am nervous, hopeful...  I can’t wait to see G!! (as he furrows his brow in squinty-eyed question-ment of why I would “not be able to wait” to see him...)  Although he’ll have to wait a little since i’m going to dinner with my girls... i haven’t seen them or spoken to them, really, in like, a year!  Very little news to give, except that I’m back on my feet and doing better.  I feel more like myself now than I ever did in Montreal.  In Montreal I was just stoned.  ALL THE TIME.  That’s how people survive in Montreal.  They get stoned a lot.  Unless of course you’re my brother, then to survive you play da guitar.  Or play with your cats.  I’m not exactly sure HOW he survives.  Maybe it’s the circus.  There are some people I can’t wait to see!!  There is one person I hope rots in... no no... I just hope I don’t see him.  I am repulsed by the fact that he would try to be nice, or worse, he’d hate me and yell at me, or worse even, he’d flirt with me... ew.  I’d just rather avoid the whole situation.  Completely.  Although I wouldn’t mind running into his sister, getting news from her... she was really nice and surprisingly normal.  I wonder how she and her boyfriend are, her kid.  She was really really good to me.  Maybe i’ll ring her up... ug.  Maybe not.  The preparation tonight will be long and stressful!  I wish I could tack on an hour somewhere in between jobs to get some stuff done!  I should do some laundry, I should clean my room before I go... argh.  It’s been a really busy couple of weeks with Gigi visiting and Max visiting... with all the work i’ve been doing... bla bla bla.  K, i can be lazy, but i’m freakin entitled!  I need a suitcase.  A small one.  All i have now is my grade 9 Roots backpack, which is still nice n’ all, but it’s kinda small.  I’ll try to borrow one from J who got a set for Christmas.  Actually, wait a minute!  i DO have a suitcase.  i'm on crack.  Let us pray, shall we?:  Dear God/Powers that be, Thank you for my life for I am blessed. I live in a city I love, I have a family I adore, I have the greatest friends anyone could ask for. I truly live in a free country, where one can speak freely and act freely, where human rights are valued and where pain and suffering are unacceptable. Give us the courage to better ourselves.  Give us the strength to make this a better world.  Give us the fortitude of spirit to love even though we are hated, to care even though the world is aloof. Remind us that life is fragile and give us the creativity to make the most of our time on Earth with the people and places we love. Thank you Thank you Thank you... for I once believed I had dug my own grave... until Quentin Tarentino showed me Kung Fu!!! :)  Amen.  You liked that little Kill Bill 2 reference??...  You like that don’cha...  I won’t be able to write again until i’m back from Montreal on Tuesday.  So, an extra-long blog.    When I read this I thought it was very fitting in the week leading up to my trip.  Here’s a little Paulo Coelho, on love, to last y’all the weekend:   Keeping open to love   There are moments when we would like very much to help someone we love deeply and we just can't seem to do a thing. Either circumstances prevent us from drawing closer or else the person has shut off to any gesture of solidarity and support.  So, all we have left is love. In those moments when everything is useless, we can still love - without expecting anything in return, any exchanges or thanks.  If we can manage to act in this way, the energy of love begins to transform the universe around us. When this energy appears, you always perform your work successfully.   "Time does not change men. Will power does not change men. Love changes men," says Henry Drummond.  I read in the newspaper about a child in Brasília who was brutally beaten by his parents. As a result, she lost her body movements and her power of speech. Admitted to the Base Hospital, she was taken care of by a nurse who said to her every day: "I love you." Although the doctors guaranteed that she could not hear and that the nurse's efforts were all to no avail, she kept repeating: "I love you, don't you forget that."  Three weeks later on, the child had recovered her movements. Four weeks later, she started to talk and smile again. The nurse never gave any interviews and the newspapers did not publish her name - but let it be registered here, so that we will never forget: love is a great healer.  Love transforms, love heals. But at times love builds mortal traps and ends up destroying the person who has decided to surrender completely. What strange sentiment is this that deep down is the only reason for us to go on living and struggling and trying to make things better?   It would irresponsible of me to try to define it because, like any other human being, all I can do is feel it. Thousands of books have been written about it, plays put on at the theater, films produced, poems scribbled, sculptures carved in wood or marble - and even so, all that the artist can convey is the idea of a feeling, not the feeling itself. But I have learned that this feeling is present in the small things and manifests itself in the most insignificant of attitudes we take, so we must always have love in mind when we act or fail to act. Picking up the phone and uttering that affectionate word we have been putting off. Opening the door and showing in someone who needs our help. Accepting a job. Leaving a job. Making that decision that we were putting off for later. Apologizing for a mistake we made that will not leave us in peace. Claiming a right that we have. Opening an account at the florist's - which is more important than the jeweler's. Playing the music loud when your loved one is far away and lower the volume when he or she is nearby. Knowing how to say "yes" and "no" - because love involves all of man's energies. Discovering a sport that can be practiced by two. Not following any prescription, not even those listed in this paragraph - because love calls for creativity.   And when none of this is possible, when all that is left is loneliness, then remember a story that a reader once sent me:  A rose dreamed day and night about having the company of the bees, but none ever came to land on her petals.  But the flower went on dreaming: during many a long night she imagined a sky with lots of bees flying towards her and kissing her tenderly. In this way she managed to resist to the next day, when she opened again to the sunlight.   One night the moon, knowing how lonely the rose felt, asked her: - Aren't you tired of waiting? - Perhaps. But I have to struggle on.  - Why? - Because if I don't open up, I will wither.  At moments when loneliness seems to crush all beauty, the only way to resist is to keep yourself open.

      If you haven't read the first two parts of this story:   urlLink Part I ,  urlLink Part II .  Suddenly her cell phone rang the Simpson’s theme song.  She fumbled through her purse, flipped the phone open and answered it without looking at the number, “hellooo...”  “ALLLOOOOO!!!”  It was her friend Anne.  They had met a few years back when  he  and Anne had worked together.  The girl had been suspicious of Anne since she was suspicious of any girl who hung around him, but was soon confident that the girl was harmless.  They quickly became friends and were an inseparable threesome with Michelle who worked in the same strip mall with Anne.  They all lived in the same neighbourhood, ran with the same crowd, lived the same lives.  They could well relate to each other; practically the same upbringing, the same schooling.  They were pretty, young, and smart – a very dangerous and a very fun combination.  The girl would spend evenings going between the store where Anne worked and the video store where Michelle worked.  They would smoke cigarettes, joints, watch movies and talk about life.  They hadn’t really spoken since she had left.  Actually, they hadn’t really spoken since about 6 months before she had left.  They had gone their separate ways, for their own reasons, mostly because of boys and the disapproval each had for the other’s choice.  Now the situation was different.  Now they were all single, happy, and doing something of their lives. Anne had gone from being a convenience store clerk to a nurse, working with pre-mature babies.  Michelle was younger than the other two, still working on how to live her life.  “Allo!” she replied, excited and nervous at the same time.  Anne and Michelle had known her in the worst of times.  It made her wonder if they knew her at all, she hadn’t been herself “then”.  “Ça fais-tu longtemps que t’es arrivée?” Anne asked, since they had made plans to get together, “T’es où?”  The girl explained when she’d arrived and invited Anne to join them at the pub.  Twenty minutes later, the girl got the excitement of screams and “Oh-my-god!” she had wanted.    They were happy to see each other.  Anne looked healthy, happy, and gorgeous as always.  Her “then” blond hair was now her natural light brown, and it suited her well.  “T’as l’air bien,” the girl said, giving Anne another hug, “C’est dommage que Michelle soit partie en fin de semaine!”  "Michelle va venir, où t’as pris ça qu’elle était partie?!"  The girl smiled as she realized that Michelle wasn’t away for the weekend as her parents had thought.  She'd lied to her parents so as not to worry them.  The girls had a long night of talking and drinking ahead of them, and Michelle had probably not wanted to have to adhere to a silly curfew.  The three of them sat down and the girl poured Anne a pint.  She looked at Anne and considered everything they had gone through together.  There had been more downs than ups, but she didn’t want to remember the downs.    Who was she kidding?  Her mind was consumed with the downs.  How much did Anne know?  What questions would she ask?  The girl remained calm.  She was among friends who loved and cared for her... but she was ashamed of the things she had done.  She was ashamed of the things she had lived through.  There were things she didn’t want her brother to know.  And if her brother knew, would he tell her parents?  At that moment the girl realized that she wasn’t listening to the conversation.  Her brother was describing a bood he had just finished and was discussing it with Anne.  The girl looked up and listened for a while before her thoughts wandered again.  “Que sera, sera” says the song... what will be?  Suddenly she realized the conversation had turned to her.  Anne seemed to have asked her a question, “Quoi?”  Anne repeated, “Est-ce qu'on s'en va?”  They made tentative plans and the girl called Michelle on her cell phone.  Her brother decided to leave and asked her to call him later when she knew what time she would be home.    Michelle's phone just rang and rang, probably fearing a call from her parents.  Leaving a message, she and Anne left the pub and headed towards Anne’s apartment.  It was a nice night: warm, clear, and calm.  The walked silently for a few moments when the girl’s cell phone rang.  It was Michelle.  The girl explained her discontent at trying to surprise her to no avail and Michelle sounded genuinely disappointed.  It did not take her long however, to remark that she hadn’t been home because of the visit.  “Devine qui j’ai vu aujourd’hui?”  The girl’s heart sank.  She didn’t want to know the answer.  In the second between the question and the answer, her heart had done summersaults and had settled in the pit of her stomach.  (To be continued)

      ug.  First, my feet are KILLING ME!!!  i am so stupid.  But i can't really help it.  New sandals dug into my feet and everytime i wear socks now the blood from my gaping wounds sticks to the socks so that when i tug on the socks to get them off they rip off the scabs and then they bleed some more.  i put band-aids, but they come off in my shoes, blood on socks, rip ow pain ow...  it's like a neverending painful cycle.  anyway, i'll go to the pharmacy today and get some decent band-aids... bigger stronger band-aids.  Second, my friend Max was in from Montreal last night and we went for dinner, bought a bottle of wine, etc.  Hence the bags under mine eyes.  So tired this morning that i started to cry when my mother told me my grandmother was being burried on Monday.  I wasn't planning on being in Montreal until Monday, I was gonna leave on Sunday afternoon... so I'm going to have to take another day off work, keep the rental car for an extra day... and I just started crying.    My office is in the hallway, I can't just start to cry like that.  Shit, I didn't even cry when I found out she was dead.  I was upset that I was missing the funeral, so I guess I'm just upset that no one took my into consideration when they were scheduling the burial.  Not that they would take me into consideration, she's just my god-mother and grandmother.  Who am i? right?  there go the tears again. faaaack.  I'm gonna go... I don't know why I'm upset.  I'm tired, OH OH! AND I'M MENSTRUATING!!! yay me!  i facking hate menstruating.  i'm just bleedin' all over the place this week.  my feet, my... ;)  Anyway, tout ça pour dire que chu fatiguée pis chu triste ostie.  i'm in dire need of coffee.  mmm.... or a chai latte... mmm....

      30,000 people went to Skydome yesterday to hear the Dalai Lama speak about compassion.  If only the Blue Jays still drew a crowd that big!  The evening started a little late due to security measures.  First there was a Tibetan Dance Troupe, which seemed to me to be very much like our own Aboriginals (the drums and the kind of dance were very similar).    Then some monks came on and chanted in a low kind of strange hum... they sounded like didgeridoos.  Then Justin Trudeau came on (a surprise for me) and introduced the Dalai Lama.  Let me just get the girly stuff out of the way before I talk about what the Dalai Lama discussed... the Dalai Lama is so adorable.  He giggled a lot and was funny and cute when he had an itch to scratch under his robe.  When his translator had microphone troubles at the beginning of the discussion, "I my voice better."  What a modest man.  He talked about compassion and love, about peace and education... he said we should all have a little more compassion.  He said our world leaders need a "little bit more compassion"... (and he did "little" with his fingers) "da leaders need to little bit more compassion" :)  so cute.  He talked about compassion bringing inner strength, bringing better self-esteem.  He said that as human beings, we all want the same thing, to be happy.  He said we all have the same worries, about our families, about our work, our physical, our mental.  He talked about love and how we should befriend those we want to attack so that we might understand each other better.  It is with friendship that we can make the world a better place.  He said that once two people know each other, then their conflicts are lesser.  Then he said an anecdote about how, as a child, he used to beat up his brother "I scratch his face" (um... ok...)  His English was pretty bad, but his translator was great, when he used him.  For some stories he would talk in Tibetan and his translator would do his thing, but not very often.  "I get older, my English get older," he said.  For the last part of his discussion, he answered questions that people had submitted.  One person asked how he kept in shape (How do you keep your svelt look??) "I get lots of sleep," he said, "I sleep at least 7 hours, maybe 8, sometime 9!"  The crowd laughed. "I eat big breakfast because Buddhist tradition have only liquid in afternoon."  I didn't know that.  Another question, "What's the biggest problem in the world today?"  The surprising answer was, "Population, too much population.  Too big difference between rich and poor.  The huge gap between rich and poor is not only morally wrong but practically wrong."  Last question said, "How can we help you get home?"  The crowd sighed.  He hadn't yet spoken of Tibet.  He said, "Buy a ticket here to Peking. Peking to Lhasa." the crowd laughed.  Then he said, "The reality, more complicated... My people count on me, I have responsibility... "  When we left the stadium, they were handing out post-card sized pictures of the Dalai Lama, which say on the back that having pictures of the Dalai Lama in China is punishable by beatings or imprisonment.  They were handing out flyers about Tibet, saying that the Chinese have been sterilizing Tibetan women and violating them with cattle prods.  STERILIZING TIBETAN WOMEN.  Shoving cattle prods up Tibetan nuns.  FOR FUCK SAKES!  They've bulldozed monastaries, they've killed hundred of thousands of Tibetans...argh!  Why aren't we doing anything?  Why isn't George Bush fighting for Tibet??  WHERE IS OUR COMPASSION?  In other news, women took to the streets of Washington yesterday to protest Bush and his pro-life stance.  He is refusing to fund "family planning" clinics and if he had his way there would be millions of unwanted children born with disease and in poverty.  Whoopi held a coat hanger and said, "This used to be choice."  Ashley Judd passionately screamed, "KEEP YOUR LAWS OFF MY BODY!" and Hillary Clinton made an appearance.  I think people should be responsible for their actions.  I think we have many many precautions to use in order to prevent pregnancy in North America (I can't speak for other regions)... I could never have an abortion.  I have a strong family support system, and I could have a child knowing that I would be helped and loved.  I am lucky.  I am also lucky that I haven't been put in the position of maybe having to make that decision.  Some girls don't have that luxury.  Some girls are in Africa, pregnant, dying of AIDS.  They are bringing sick children into this world because the US isn't funding abortion clinics there.  Some girls get kicked out of their house or will die should they deliver a child...  On the news they were showing Christian groups protesting the protesters, "praying" for them, brandishing bibles... mostly men.  I imagine those men going home, touching their wives who recoil in disgust.  Or worse, their wives are proud of them...  I'll pray for them.  I'll pray for Bush.  I pray that they befriend the people they do not understand, that they live with compassion, and lead a happy life.

      If you haven't read the first part of the story, go  urlLink here .  Ahem.  This is nerve-racking!  What if you guys think my story is stupid??  What if you think it's flaky?  Here goes nuthin!  She could hear a guitar being put down and a voice, muffled, her brother talking to his cats.  “Who could it be?  Is it my sister?  Is it?”  Opening the door, the girl smiled.  Her brother had been growing his moustache again, something she couldn’t stand.  She pinched his cheek and hugged him, asked him what he was up to.  “Not much,” he answered, “just playing some songs.”  He had discovered a fondness for song writing in recent years and she thought he had an affinity for it.    “So, where are your bags?”  She explained that she thought they might go grab a drink before having her settle in, and he agreed.  They headed out to a pub nearby, chatting about her trip and her plans for the weekend.  “Do you plan on seeing any of your old friends?”    Her old friends... her heart tightened at the thought.  She worried about the memories they would trigger, the questions they would ask... Had she spoken with him since?  Had she gotten over him?  Did she know about...?  No.  Yes.  Yes... she knew.   She told her brother her plans for the weekend and spoke with glee of the party her ex-co-worker had planned.  Trying to put her old friends out of her mind, she smiled at her brother and asked him about his life.    The smells of the city were familiar.  They walked by the park and she smiled.  She remembered the winter when she and her best friend had bought crazy carpets and had gone sliding.  They were dressed to the hilts and the hill was pure ice.  Their bums were bruised for days.  She remembered, just before she left, on a night where she was avoiding her apartment because it was full of boxes and filled of tension, her and her brother had taken a walk to this park and had sat down to watch some short films they were showing on a warm summer night.    How much better things would have been had he never been a part of my life, she thought.  “Things happen for a reason I guess,” she said, noticing her brother seemed quiet, “Have you ever read Paulo Coelho’s Fifth Mountain?”  She had always loved Paulo Coelho’s books, relishing each one with all her attention and patience.  A lady who worked in her office had lent her The Fifth Mountain, the only book of his she hadn’t read, and it had come to her at the perfect moment in her life.  She had learned from this tale that God has a plan, that everything in life has a purpose.  She tried to implement these ideals in her own life.  When her best friend worried about his sick father, she tried to explain to him that he couldn’t “prevent the inevitable” and that everything happened for a reason, even death, even sickness.  She tried to consider God, but she did not believe that God was necessary to her new theory on life, just a name people had given destiny.  Her brother had only read Paulo Coelho’s The Alchemist, his most popular work, and asked her what The Fifth Mountain was about.  “It’s about the prophet Elijah and his trials and tribulations,” she said, flippantly.  She found it difficult to explain things to people and often came off as being arrogant since she brushed off an explanation.  Had he read the book, perhaps they would have been able to discuss it, perhaps she would have found it easier to open up to him.  “It’s really good though, I really like Paulo Coelho,” she continued quickly, so as not to bother him.  “His books have really taught me to follow my instinct and watch for the signs that life gives us.”  “What kind of signs?”  Feeling safer to continue, she said, “Well, sometimes they’re really obvious and sometimes they’re kind of subtle... it’s hard to explain.  Take this trip for example.  My ex-co-worker wrote to me and said, ‘Can you try to come to Montreal for the weekend?’ and I thought to myself, she could have said, ‘I’m having a party, isn’t that great?’ but she asked me if I could come.  The answer to ‘can you come’ was yes.  I saw it as a sign that I should come, that it was time for me to come, you know?  Sometimes the signs are subtler.  Like, there was a time I was looking for inspiration and a book literally fell into my lap.  I could have picked up that book and put it away from where it fell, but I decided to open it because it might have been a sign... and it was!  It’s almost like trusting that things happen when they are supposed to happen and that if we’re open to these things, and do what we are supposed to do when we are supposed to do it, things will turn out for the best.”  “Or at least you hope things will turn out for the best,” he replied.  “I have a feeling we’ll be fine.  I think bad things happen to those who lose all hope and look to the ground rather than looking for a way out...”  They considered this for a while.  The girl often said things she didn’t really believe, just to hear them and think about them.  She thought again about God.  They entered the pub and sat down.  It was smoky and noisy, just as she remembered.  They ordered a pitcher of beer and her brother continued, “So do you think our lives are pre-determined?”  She thought for a moment and said, “No, I think we all have a good path to follow, but there’s that whole free-will thing... wow.  How Matrixy is that?”

      Since I wasn't taking notes whilest watching TV at 12:15am last night, I can't tell you who Jon Stewart was interviewing, but this man whom I will call "Bob" wrote a book on the media's bashing of the US.  He devoted a chapter to Canada, Belgium and South Korea (during the interview he said that there was so little to say on these countries that he had to put them all in the same chapter) -- Jon Stewart said something that I thought was so funny, I laughed for like, 5 solid minutes, and then proceeded to giggle whenever I thought about it today.  I wish I could quote exactly, but what he said, approximately, was this, "Canada being angry with America, is like Mr. Rogers throwing a rock through your window!"  Bob didn't have anything to say to that.  He considered Canada to be inconsequential.  Well Bob, Jon Stewart doesn't seem to think we're inconsequential -- no!  To Jon Stewart, we're Mister Freakin' Rogers!!!  I love that.  Walking through my back yard/Grange Park today, I saw a fish head laying on the ground.  That's pretty random, don't you think?  I blame it on China town, cuz it's easy to blame stuff on that part of the city.  DAMN YOU CHINA TOWN!!    me just kidding!  Last night, Gigi and I left Amato's Pizza and were walking towards my house, when a guy starts yelling at us from behind:  "Hey! -pause- Ya, I'm talkin to you! -pause- Hey guy in the red hat! (Gigi was wearing a red baseball cap) -waiting for reaction- Hey I'm talking to you!  Turn around!  I just want to talk to you!  What if i'm crazy?!  I'M COMING UP BEHIND YOU..."  this went on for about a block and a half.  I told Gigi we should pretend we don't really speak English.  When he had reached us, I said, annoyed, "C'est quoi ton problème??" and Gigi, calmly said, "Allo, ça va?"  We proceeded to talk to him, in a broken English, until he got to his street.  Funny how nice he got when he realized we didn't really speak English.  He was drunk (obviously), he was a Ryerson student in Journalism... eesh!  poor Ryerson.  He asked us where we were from, we said Montréal!  He asked us how we liked Toronto.  I was pretty proud of my broken English.  Not that it's hard.  Gigi's English got better and better as the conversation progressed, I had to remind him, in French, to slow down and keep acting like he didn't really speak the language.  Gigi was beginning to use a vocabulary better than this kid's.  He talked about how it's hard to have conversations with people, and we tried to explain to him how people get scared and avoid talking to people... ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE THREATENING THEM!!!  SHEESH!  I had to refrain from laughing out loud.  I was then afraid that he lived in my building or something, as he said, "this is my street" just as i was about to say it.  Then he invited us to come over and smoke a joint, but it was late, and stoned, we might have ruined our whole act.  Oh well.  That was our adventure!  Yay drunk people on a Wednesday night!  So, I want to keep writing the story I started, but the beginning was really easy to write, and I don't know what should happen in the rest, and how I want it to end.  I kept it going a little bit, I'll try and post something tomorrow, being Friday 'n all.  I got flowers today for doing my job.  Apparently I fall into the "Administrative assistant" category and qualify for the "receiving gifts" during secretaries week.  Yay presents for doing something I get paid to do anyway!  The flowers are very pretty too!!  They're orange daisies... they very much brighten up my "cubicle"... :)  I think everyone should go out and buy themselves random flowers today, or buy random flowers for someone else.  They're so pretty and they really make people happy... unless they have allergies, and then it's not so happy.  The Maroon 5 album is Bon Jovi for the year 2004.  The whole album is about this girl and the music is pure PURE pop.  it's alright, i guess.  it'll be fun for the car ride to Montreal!  I'm getting really excited for this trip!  I can't wait!  I'm going to try to organize my trip properly... I may not get to see everyone that I want to see, and I probably won't get much sleep, but that's ok...

      the beginning of that story is pretty good (see next post)!  i'll continue it some other time... i want to think about it some more.  it's interesting to mix real life with fiction... it's a good way for me to express how i feel without embarassing myself with the complete truth... :)  cuz you can't prove nuthin!  my heart has been beating uncomfortably of late.  like beating really hard, even sans coffee.  very very disconcerting.  man!  are ALL my vices gonna have to go out the window??  maybe it's just stress (because i work OH so hard...) i dunno.  I'd go see a doctor except that's a big pain in the ass.  i'd have to wait 3 weeks just to get an apointment!  then the doctor would ask, "have you been doing any stressful activities lately?"  and i would say, "define stressful activity" and he would say, "Heavy lifting, excessive working out..." and i would say no.  he/she probably wouldn't ask me if i've been doing any drugs.  (maria thinks back to see if she actually HAS been doing drugs)(if you have to think back, one of two things, not at all, or too many!)  could it be the weed? i shudder to think!!  no no couldn't be... couldn't BE!!! NOOOOOOO! fine fine... i'll cut back (because i've been smoking sooooo much... NOT!)  anyway, i'm hungry.  maybe i can find some sort of heart palpitation calming food.  eesh.   i was gonna talk about my boogers.  maybe some other time... oh oh! but i do want to mention that i bought Sarah McLachlin's newest album and i adore her, and i bought some other CD (this love has taken it's tole on me, she said goodbye... to many times befowowre...-- AH!)  Maroon 5?  is that it?  anyway, i'll let you know if the whole album is as fun as their 2 singles.

      The girl got out of the car and streched.  Bringing her arms down she eyed the building infront of her... how long had it been?  A year? no... less than a year... 8 months.  She'd need more than a weekend to visit everyone she had missed and visit the places she had loved.    The arrival had been somewhat anti-climatic.  Wanting to surprise her "then" best friend, she arrived at the girl's home, only to be told that she was away for the weekend.  There would be no scream, no hug, no Oh-my-god!...   She had driven down familiar roads, switched on her "then" favorite radio station and sighed... the radio people were the same, the streets were the same... she felt akward, silly, just as she had then.  Without knowing where else to go, she had made her way to her brother's apartment, taking the back streets so that she could pass by her old haunts, her ex-apartment.  A knot had formed in her stomach.  What if she ran into him?  How would he react?  What would he do?  What would  she  do??  She would remain calm, she would be polite, nice even, if she ran into him.  How are you? she would ask, How is your sister?... she hoped she wouldn't have to even say hello.  It was a big city and maybe he had moved away.  She was a changed girl.  Not at all the same person who had run from this place like a bat outta hell.  She was calmer, happier, friendlier... she knew when to draw the line.  She knew how to stand up for herself.  At least, she hoped she had learned to do that, to stand up for herself, for what she thought and how she felt.  Who was she kidding.  She leaned on the car and took a deep breath.  She was early and wondered if her brother was even home.  A light was on in his apartment but she decided to go for a walk before going inside.  She still had an hour before being expected.  Making sure the car doors were locked she walked to the main street to take in the sights and sounds, to try and remember how great this city could be.  She couldn't concentrate.  Too many memories of how stupid she had been flooded back.    I shouldn't have come, she thought, maybe I should head back to the car.  I'll be calmer inside the apartment.  Hanging out with her brother was calming.  They had grown up together and found many of the same things amusing.  They enjoyed a lot of the same music, the same news.  When they had lived in the same city, Sunday afternoons were spent brunching and window shopping together.  They'd spent hours in the magazine stores, reading and yelling at each other to "come see!", neither of them being able to afford much.  Things were different now.  She had a job, no  two  jobs and she had enough money to afford a last minute trip to visit friends.  She was repaying debts and could afford breakfast and a coffee whenever she wanted.  Maybe she would treat her brother to brunch at a nice restaurant, she thought.  When she finally looked up she realized that she had walked further than intended, and the knot in her stomach had somewhat subsided.    She crossed the street to take a different route back.  It was a warm night and the street was bustling.  An older couple passed by, smiled and said, "Bonsoir!"  People made eye contact in this city and she wondered what they were looking at, or for.  The people here were strange, like they were hiding something, a big secret, a damaged past.  They appeared crazy, outgoing, fun loving... everyone was a little off.  When she had lived here everyone seemed nice enough.  There were a few friends she considered "close" but the rest were superficial... Even her close friends, now that she thought about it, seemed a little off.  Had she always had this impression of the new people in her life?  She had been blessed with the greatest friends on Earth, a nice group of people she had met in high school, kept throughout her university years and stayed in touch with even now.  They were no longer as close as she would like, but... "that's life", she assumed.  She found the door to her brother's building unlocked and jumped up the stairs.  She'd run in and say hello, her bags could wait in the trunk.  Maybe they'd go grab a beer, she thought, as she knocked on the door.  (to be continued...)

      wow.  first, Gigi is in town for the week, house and job hunting.  we went *jogging* this morning, i wanted to DIE.  but i'll try again tomorrow...  good weekend on the whole -- had food, had drinks, saw friends... good times had by all!  i love house hunting.  as long as i don't have to move into the house (packing up all my shit and unpacking all my shit) i love to house hunt.  i hope my boys find a nice house.  their moving in together promises to be good fun, especially for the summer!  this morning, as i was walking into the building where i work, rubbing my eyes because of the dusty entrance to my building... "Maria?!"  Holy shit!  in high school, i was in this play that Gigi wrote called "Ainsi soit-il" and i played the mother who lost her husband in a factory fire.  i had 2 kids in this play and i ran into my son this morning.  He was taller, lanky, skinny... pretty much the same, working in one of the ministers' offices.  we're gonna go for lunch today maybe.  i wonder how long he's been working here.  this kid's older brother died of AIDS a few years ago.  Patrick was his name -- he contracted the disease from a blood transfusion.  i remember people being really cool about it.  when Patrick died i got his parents address and meant to send a card to "my son"... i can't remember if i did.  maybe i should just say, "did you get my card i sent you?" and if he says no, we can just chalk it up to the bad bad postman... i remember thinking about the card, what i would write (what do you write when someone loses a brother??!!) and i got the address... i must've sent it? no? argh.  damn me and my horrible memory!!!  i've wondered about him a few times, where he was, what he was doing... now he's working for a minister!  his title (he gave me his card) says, "Legislative Assistant" oooo... shiny...  i guess that's the extent of the excitment in my life at the moment.  might have a little graphic design contract ahead -- i'll let you know more as i know more.  i'm going to Montreal the weekend of the first of May.  a girl i used to work with is having a big party and she invited me... i haven't been back to Montreal since... well... since i moved back to Toronto.  hopefully i won't run into anyone i don't want to run into... it'll be strange being back, very very strange.  strange, but fun.  road trip!! vaca!! ah life. the insanity continues (but ain't it grand??!)

      * oH MY  GOD!!!   I woke up late this morning.  My hair isn't agreeing with me today.  All i wanted was to get in a cab, and have it drive me to work.  For the nth time, THE CAB DRIVER DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS GOING.  anybody who knows anything about Toronto, especially a cab driver, should know that you can't turn left onto University Ave from any other major road, like Dundas or College.  The cabbie took the crappiest of crappy routes to get me to the corner of College and University, and i was like, just let me out, you can't turn here, i'm late, just learn to  DRIVE!!!!!   AHHHHHHHHH!!!  it's their facking job to know how to drive, why don't they know where they're going????  it's not my job to tell them how to drive!  breathe breathe...  In other news, last night i had the sales guy from my "other" job telling me how i should design my covers.  He SAT AT MY COMPUTER, beside me, telling me what i should put on the cover and what i should do.  i was like  OH MY  GOD.  i am totally open to constructive critisism, but don't tell me how i should do my job.  i was so angry.  "maria, i think you should put her on a cloud, or put this like they're looking through a window."  what??!!! are you serious??  i'm leaving now.  and i left.   urlLink on a funny or not so funny note, and to really begin my day on a better note, here's the news story Canada's buzzing about this morning.   oh geez... today is crap day.  HAPPY CRAP DAY EVERYONE!

      Ah Hockey.  i went to a pub last night to watch a play-off game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Ottawa Senators... woohoo!!!  Ottawa kicked ass.  I’ve decided i’m rooting for Montreal. :) i like Toronto though.  J was explaining to me the greatness of Ottawa.  He says they’re a really classy team.  we also talked politics, because after the game there was The National with the dreamy Peter Mansbridge.  Ariel Sharon came on with Bush and they were chit chatting.  B who was watching the game with us started to clap when they came on TV.  I thought he was being sarcastic.  Some guy in the bar came up to B and said, “Why do you clap for this man?  Do you not know how much blood he has on his hands?”  I was like, Whoa!  The guy’s friends came and got him and distracted him so that he went away, i guess they were under the impression it was gonna get physical.  I thought the conversation was actually a good debate, and i was interested in the discussion... oh well.  I felt glad we were in a country where we can have that kind of discussion without anything exploding.  I asked if either of them knew why China invaded Tibet.  They both thought, J and B, that it was a matter of greed and penis size (my term, not theirs).  I just can’t wrap my brain around it.  People would really mass murder and destroy ancient temples for the hell of it?  It doesn’t make sense to me.  We drank too much beer.  The pitchers were 4L and we had 2 amongst 6 or 7 people.  The second pitcher was pretty much split between the 3 of us though.  Then we went to my house... smoked some pipe weed and watched the Daily Show.  God that show’s funny.  So funny.  Woke up this morning and reluctantly went to work.  Today’s turning out to be a good day though.  I can’t wait to get home and have some computer fun.  Life’s gettin better kiddies!  The light at the end of the tunnel is getting brighter.  There was a time when i never thought i would get to the surface for some air... but my jobs are getting more tolerable, more fun, summer is approaching, everyone’s getting happier, doing more things...  it's awesome.   The only real problem i have is my roommate.  he's still jobless and he's bored out of his mind.  it's affecting him - obviously.  i've been there and i know how much it sucks.  granted, i've never been there for as long as he (he hasn't worked since October) but i still know how bad it sucks.  Sometimes i find myself wishing his mom gives him an ultimatum and forces him to move back home with her.  I could find another roommate... it's a bad thought, isn't it??  ug.  i like roomie, but i get annoyed with him.  i don't get annoyed with everyone.  i've had plenty of roommates, and there were some i got along famously with.    He plays techno music ALL THE TIME and with the bass turned way up... i love techno, really, but NOT AT HOME ALL THE TIME... i like it in a club!  or before i go out!  not at 10pm on a Monday night when i'm tired and i'm reading quietly...  He's ALWAYS home... he never cleans, he does do the dishes, but half-assed! argh!!!  Anyway, it's Thursday already and i can't wait for the weekend. S wants to go out and i really like the bar she wants to go to so i'll probably go with her on Friday night.  this weekend will be the weekend of putting my crap away, organizing my new room... yay!

      Tenzin Gyatso is the name of the 14th Dalai Lama.  He will be in Toronto on April 25th, 2004 and i have bought tickets for me and my friends.  I'd like to commend Prime Minister Paul Martin for agreeing to meet (finally) with the Dalai Lama despite China's opposition.  The Canadian leader is only seeing the Dalai Lama as a "spiritual leader", nevertheless Tibet's quest for independance is an important one for democratic rights and cannot be ignored.  Canada has been asked to play a pivotal role as mediator between China and Tibet.  Poor Tibet -- leave em alone!  I can't imagine a more peaceful person than the Dalai Lama, or the Buddhist philosophy for that matter.  Like, HEY CHINA, GET OUTTA TIBET ALREADY!    So why is China all over Tibet like a fat kid on a chocolate bar?  Well, China has a population of 1,286,975,468 people (that's a whole lot of people!!!) almost 5 times the population of the US in a slightly smaller country... So you can imagine the lack of natural resources... which Tibet has TONS of...  The Chinese have destroyed thousands of Tibetan monestaries and killed hundreds of thousand Tibetans... all in the name of... what?  Free Uranium?  Gold?  More Chinese people??  Less Buddhists??  Are they really THAT mean?  Meanies!   urlLink From Tibet.com:  "The Chinese themselves view Tibet in colonial terms: that is, not as part of China proper, but as non-Chinese territory which China has a right to own and exploit, on the basis of relationship that existed 700 years ago, or, at best, 200 years ago. This attitude is evident already from the title of the Chinese Government's White Paper, which refers to the "ownership" of Tibet. If Tibet were truly an integral part of China for hundreds of years, as China claims, Tibet could not form the object of "ownership" by the country it is already a part of. The very notion of "ownership" of Tibet by China is colonialist and imperialist in nature."  Commie Colonialists!!!  I am so very confused.  Do the Chinese really think that Tibetans are "lesser" people and deserve to be eradicated?  Or do they just not care...  What is this?  Nazi Germany??  Are we in 1945 again??  Are we ignoring these people because they're in a far-away land??    What The Fuck??!!  and i think the F word is warranted here.  These are a poor peaceful people.  I can't get over the inaction of "western" governments.  We'll award the Dalai Lama a Nobel Peace Prize, but we won't help him out.  Keep up the good work ol' chap! and good luck to ya! Don't let the door hit you on the way out! g'bye now!   slam.   if anyone knows why China is doing this, please let me know, i can't seem to find it online, cuz the reasons i'm finding are just stu-u-pid.   urlLink From the Prayers of the Buddhist Monk Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet   Most glorious possessor of all good qualities Who thinks of all beings as one's own child, All Buddhas of the three times, Bodhisattvas, and disciples Please listen to my sad true words.  May those who suffer without interruption Bearing the burden of countless dark deeds Find an ocean of peace free from unbearable fears Of sickness, war, famine and so forth.  May those who are crazed by evil delusions And bring harm to themselves and suffering to others Be an object of compassion, gain great understanding, And enjoy friendship and love with all sentient beings.  For as long as space remains, For as long as beings reside in Samsara, There may I also remain To clear away the misery of others.  Both here and throughout this entire vast world May sickness, war, famine, and so forth end now. May all enjoy the wealth of the Dharma and the bliss of good virtue; May this glorious wealth and bliss grow without end.  -----------------------------------------  From the Tao Te Ching (Lao Tsu, translated by Gia-Fu Feng & Jane English)  30  Whenever you advise a ruler in the way of Tao, Counsel him not to use force to conquer the universe. For this would only cause resistance. Thorn bushes spring up wherever the army has passed. Lean years follow in the wake of a great war. Just do what needs to be done. Never take advantage of power.  Achieve results, But never glory in them. Achieve results, But never boast. Achieve results, But never be proud. Achieve results, Because this is the natural way. Achieve results, But not through violence.  Force is followed by loss of strength. This is not the way of Tao. That which goes against the Tao comes to an early end.   31  Good weapons are instruments of fear; all creatures hate them. Therefore followers of Tao never use them. The wise man prefers the left. The man of war prefers the right.  Weapons are instruments of fear; they are not a wise man's tools. He uses them only when he has no choice. Peace and quiet are dear to his heart, And victory no cause for rejoicing. If you rejoice in victory, then you delight in killing; If you delight in killing, you cannot fulfill yourself.  On happy occasions precedence is given to the left, On sad occasions to the right. In the army the general stands on the left, The commander-in-chief on the right. This means that war is conducted like a funeral. When many people are being killed, They should be mourned in heartfelt sorrow. That is why a victory must be observed like a funeral.  ----------------------------------  From the Tao Te Ching:  What is more fluid, more yielding than water? Yet back it comes again, wearing down the rigid strength which cannot yield to withstand it. So it is that the strong are overcome by the weak, the haughty by the humble.  This we know, but never learn.  —Lao-tsu

      Something I found in Paulo Coelho's Maktub, which resonates with me, and my missed opportunity this weekend to have a real discussion with my brother.  'The master says:	 "Make use of every blessing that God gave you today.  A blessing cannot be saved.  There is no bank where we can deposit blessings received, to use them when we see fit.  If you do not use them, they will be irretrievably lost.	  "God knows that we are creative artists when it comes to our lives.  On one day, he gives us clay for sculpting, on another, brushes and canvas, or a pen.  But we can never use clay on our canvas, nor pens in sculpture.	  "Each day has its own miracle.  Accept the blessings, work, and create your minor works of art today.  "Tomorrow you will receive others." '  I let an opportunity slip by, even though many previous thoughts and signs had been given me.    DOH!  ;)

      ah yes... played outside this weekend.  the air was warm... and the city was buzzing!!! the patios were full of crazy kids drinking beer and the beautiful people were out.  today will be the coldest day all week.  we're looking at 3 today, 9 tomorrow, 10 thursday, 19 oh yes, 19 Friday... mmm... warmth. (celcius, of course)  great weekend, did NOTHING.  well, did somethings, cleaned out my room to make way for MY NEW BED!!!!  very weird, sleeping that high up.  didn't sleep well at all last night.  but the desk is awesome, and i have so much more room in my room, it's amazing.  Friday, day of rest, was spent smoking pipe weed and, well, sitting around.  mmm sitting around.  it was, dare i say it, fucking great.  I haven’t been that stoned since montreal.  Deeeelicious.    Saturday was spent cleaning up, talking akwardly to my oldest brother on the phone (wasn’t expecting his call just then and was in a strange mood) (sent him an e-mail this morning to elaborate on the conversation).  Also, I purchased a scrap book so that i can classify various rave flyers and letters or birthday cards from friends.  Sunday was Easter, ding dong the Christ is dead, rub your eyes, get out of bed, ding dong the Jesus Christ is deeeaaaaad.    OH!  which reminds me, Saturday afternoon i went over to my friend S's house (i was about to leave when my brother called, adding to the akward-ness of the conversation) - we watched the Wizard of Oz... god i love that movie, polished off 2 bottles of white wine, chit chatted, had food, good times were had by all. :) i love that girl.  but back now to Easter, i went to da Oak of da ville (aka Oakville) and played with the kiddies (who persist in telling me i'm cool, but i think it's a ploy to get me to play with them) - i played and i was tired like, two minutes into playing.  you know on play grounds, the tire that's tied up with chains that's like a swing, well, i had trouble getting in, and i'm dizzy just thinking about it.  stop.  stop!  Nick! stop pushing and stop this thing!  Nick!  NICK IF YOU DON'T STOP I'M GONNA PUKE ALL OVER YOU!!  And he giggled.  And his sister Alex giggled.  Ya, you think it’s funny.  I made the mistake of getting on again the next day.  Ya, that was pleasant for maybe... 1 minute.  Then it started spinning and my stomach started to churn again.  we played toss the shoe.  that was fun.  it was calm.  Nick lent me 2 more Harry Potter books.  but he couldn't find the second one.  or the fourth one, so i went home with Year 3 (Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban - Movie is out soon) and Year 5 (Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix).  Year 5 is the hugest kids book i have EVER seen.  unless you consider the Lord Of The Rings a kids book.  i can't wait to read it, Harry Potter i mean.  i'm already almost half way through Year 3.  i was reading it last night when i couldn't sleep.  then i had strange Harry Potter dreams.  Nick said that a girl in his class read the Year 5 Harry Potter book in ONE DAY.  i told him she was full o' poo.  he seemed persuaded.  i shruged.  Came home on Monday afternoon, had a snack, my dad came over with D and we set up MY NEW BED!!!!  and then we went for dinner and then came home and set up my computer... yay room to work!!!  i'm very excited to get settled.  in other news, GIGI IS MOVING BACK TO THE CITY!!!  forget Ottawa the sucky and boring, he's MOVIN ON UP BACK TO THE CITY!!  don't get me wrong, i love Ottawa, it's a great city, but i wouldn't live there.  i don't know how Gigi survived this long!  this is shaping up to be an even better summer than anticipated!  yay!  i have to remember though -- i'm saving up to go to Europe... i'm saving up to go to Europe... i'm saving up to go to Europe...

      dedictations now even truth... with no power, nothing to do.  i still remember... why don’t you -DON’T YOU! THIS IS NOT FOR YOU!!  yay da Jam of Pearl.  k, officially obsessed again.  sigh...  i've been wondering how personal i should get on here.  how deep i should delve.  i have been going through some inner conflicts, but all in all my life is going very well at the moment.  i gave myself a Taro reading last night and it was eerily accurate.  eerily.  eeerriilllyyyy... ooooo!!!  i'd talk about it, but it has to do with my family (my olderest brother to be exact - oh and my mom) but i know the people who come to this website, and i feel asthough i could be "airing my dirty laundry".  hm... i'll get a coffee, think about it, and get back to you momentarily... (which will seem like just a second to you!  ah the joys of writing)...  ha! i got my coffee and i forgot to think about it.  ya.   i woke up this morning feeling very very sleepy and not at all wanting to get up.  i've started getting into the habit of getting up really early so that i can get to work really early and go to the gym in between jobs, but this morning was a no go.  pourtant, i went to sleep early enough!  anyway, i think i'll talk about it once it has been resolved.  i guess i could talk about my mom, since everyone has a mom and it seems to me a lot of them act this way... my mom, well, she's a bit of a control freak.  i wonder why though.  i mean, her mother was a total control freak in the freakiest of ways and i think it's bullshit.  her (my mom's) controlling-ness is annoying and hurtfull.  i doubt it's a conscious effort to make me and (i'm assuming) my brothers feel bad -- she questions everything I do, every penny i spend, every decision i make -- and then when i start (inevitably) crying or screaming, she recants, she's doing it to help me...  example, she visited, as i mentionned in a past blog. well, while she was here, i had to leave her in my apartment alone.  i hid or gave my roommate the essentials (pipe, rolling papers, vibrator) but she found and looked through the following,   my visa bills my TV payment bills my telephone bills my bank statements  she circled various things "what was this you bought?  why did you write a cheque for $1400??"  oh my god  you're kidding, right?  you didn't just go through all my stuff, did you?  are you KIDDING ME?  ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?  no you can't be serious.  i'm TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OLD AND YOU'RE GOING THROUGH MY CRAP?????  she didn't understand why i was so upset.  "your dad and i will help pay your bills" -- ya, whatever, so you can make me feel guilty for years to come... no thanks, i'm doing just fine thank you.  oh no, i'm sorry, not thank you, fuck you. (i don't swear to my mother, this is just me venting).  i lie to my parents.  i lie to them all the time.  i lie for two reasons:  the first, my mother's judgemental attitude.  if she knew the things i did, she'd have a corenary (sp?) -- the second, my father gets really worried, like to the point of getting ulcers.  what he doesn't know won't hurt him, right?  what i want to know is what is behind this controlling and nagging behaviour.  what is the fear behind it?  what is she really trying to control?    she and my father raised me and did a damn good job, i think.  i'm not and have never been "with child" (thank god), i'm not a drug addict, i don't smoke (except whilest clubbing), nothing is pierced (unless you notice the scar on my eyebrow), nothing tattood... i work two jobs, i visit my family, i respect my elders, i am literate, informed, presentable, nice, pretty, healthy, trendy, i am not now or have ever been a member of the communist party... um, what exactly, more, do they want??  God, like, deal with your own problems, and then maybe i'll talk to you about mine, but my 'rents have  i-s-su-es!  i'll be damned if i don't confront my mother about it.  but i have to be prepared.  calm, collected.  she ain't stayin' at my house no more.  how would she feel if her sister came to stay at her house for a weekend and went through her stuff, confronted her on her spending habits??  argh!!!!!  Her entire family is like her (or the complete opposite) they're either controllers or controllees.  How unsure of herself must my mother be to feel asthough everything must be under control?  It’s really hard for me to deal with control too.  I don’t want to be a controlling maniac.  I want the people around me to feel free to do whatever the hell they want.  I can express my concerns, and i can hope to receive an answer, but i can’t tell anyone what to do.    oh i’ve tried.  Just ask my last boyfriend.  In hindsight he was a project, someone i wanted to fix and/or control.  He was a wild horse i wanted to rope in and ride off into the sunset with.  so i grabbed my lasso, reeled him in and was patient.  He threw me off, kicked me in the face a couple times (figuratively), but i stayed patient.  Until i realized that i was being an idiot and i could just find a pre-trained horse.  Duh.  Now i'm slowly getting back up on my feet, only to have my mother walk in and say, "What the hell are you doing on the ground over there?  GET UP!  Here, let me help you."  She's throwing me up on my feet when my knees are still weak and i might just fall on the ground again.  LET. ME. MAKE. MY. OWN. MISTAKES.  faaaaaaaaaack.  anyway, i imagine someone might tell me not to "rock the boat" but i look at some of my mother's sisters who have kids who are no longer speaking to them, and i wonder...  Easter weekend is upon us, AND ON MONDAY NIGHT I GET MY BED!!! ooo ya ooo ya!!!  i get good food on Sunday night!!! ooo ya ooo ya!!!  and my daddy's coming to visit!  to PUT MY BED TOGETHER!!!  ooo ya ooo ya... ok, that's gettin old.  all this means that i have to CLEAN MY ROOM (doom noises, dah dah doaaaaaah)... on my day off tomorrow.  go through the boxes that are still lingering from the move.  boxes i once had in storage, but really deserve to be in the garbage.  University binders, random papers... sigh...  c'est la vie!  what is also "la vie" is that i have to get some work done.  AND LISTEN TO VITALOGY  ooo ya ooo ya...  many faeries to all, and to all a good day :)

      Kurt Cobain must be doing circles in his grave.  Biography after Biography after Spotlight after TV Special... They’ve mass produced his notebook... makes me want to vomit.  I’d rather focus on the living.  One of the many biographies of last night on the “grunge” movement, made me say, “HEY! I haven’t listened to Pearl Jam’s Ten in a really really long time.  That’s a great album.”  Hence the title... oh Ed Vedder – you’re so dreamy! Although I must admit also thinking Jeff Ament is pretty fine lookin’ too.  Not that I like them cuz they’re hot.  That would be very girly of me wouldn’t it?!    God! these guys were, and are, creators of some of the best rock in history.  Temple of Dog, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam... if i hadn’t been so wrapped up in Tori Amos and Sarah McLaughlin at the time, i might’ve appreciated it more.  I didn’t get my first Pearl Jam record until my brother came home from University one Christmas and said, “Hey, Maria, have you ever listened to a Pearl Jam record?”  All i had heard before then were the releases, Jeremy, Alive, Even Flow... but G brought home No Code – Present Tense and Smile and Lukin... the deep mesmerizing voice of Ed Vedder lulled me to sleep at night – we hardly had internet back then, at home we just had text-net sans images – but i surfed and surfed, looking for anything i could get my hands on – lyrics, bios, discographies... what had i missed??  Online, i found the site which had, in my opinion, the most accurate lyrics and the biggest array of information on the band.  The guy running it was called Ryan Niman and i asked him many a question on lyrics.  I’m a stickler – G and I argued, in Black is it, “I know someday you’ll have a beautiful life, I know you’ll be a star? or a sun? - in somebody else’s sky oh why why why can’t it be, can’t in be in miiiiiiiiine” if only i could sing online.  I went to the store almost immediately to buy the albums in order, although i already had No Code.  Ten, Vs, Vitalogy, No Code, Yeild, oh Yeild... my first then my second Pearl Jam concert.  Ryan and I were still e-mailing, still loving Pearl Jam, even though i was now in University, doing other things, Ryan e-mails – “Maria, I’m in the fan club and i get buy tickets to a Pearl Jam concert.  I bought 2 for the Toronto show.”  Then i bought 2 to the Montreal show two days later.  The Toronto show was outside in Molson Park, my dad let me borrow the car.  I was standing in the pit at first, Pearl Jam got on stage and immediately began to rock hard – and a cloud of dust started to envelop the crowd moshing below... a girl infront of me began to flip out and told me to fuck off when i said, “Calm down, it’ll be easier to get out if you’re calm...” I fell and a hippy boy helped me up, a big smile on his face.  I got out of the crowd and spit out dust for 5 minutes.  Ed made a reference to some bombings, the crowd had no idea what he was talking about.  One of my roommates had been working at the show and brought me an Eddie Vedder hand-written set list – i had it on my wall for a year.  She had almost told him to get down from the rafters because she didn’t know who he was.   For the trip to Montreal I had made a few Pearl Jam mixed tapes to get us in the mood.  Before the show the entire crowd was having a great time, doing the wave, cheering – we had filled the arena.  We should have used Ryan’s fan club tickets for this show, oops, but since i had bought them late, we were behind the stage, pretty close, but with a backside view.  Great concert, and for Present Tense, my favourite then, Eddie turned to face the back crowd, and I felt like he was singing to me... “Have you the belief that the road ahead sends off into the light...”  then in second year of University I had a crush on a boy, a boy who thought Ed Vedder was God and knew a lot of Tori Amos lyrics – I’d still love the boy if he weren’t so damn suicidal (that’s what you get for loving a die-hard existential philosopher) and the day the first live album went on sale I ran RAN to the little record store on campus.  I ran back to his dorm room, “I BOUGHT IT I BOUGHT IT!!!” with the Untitled song “i got a car, i got some gas, let’s get outta here, get outta here fast... oooh everyone’s confused, so i stay in my room, if i go i don’t want to go alone... (guitar intro to MFC)...”  Then i bought Binaural, but mostly out of obligation... they’ve released 2 albums since, Riot Act and Lost Dogs (and many many bootleg live albums), that i haven’t bought.  I wish i had more time to listen to music.  I guess i wish i had more time for a lot of things.  I’m sure Eddie Vedder would tell me to read rather than listen to his albums...   Best PJ songs, in my opinion, then i have to stop:  On Ten: Porch (“you didn’t leave a message at least i coulda learned your voice one last time”) Jeremy (tragic foreshadowing of Columbine, no? “clearly I remember, picking on the boy, seemed a harmless little fuck”) Release (“I’ll ride the wave where it takes me”)  On Vs (k, i ADORE this album): Daughter (“Alone, listless, breakfast table in an otherwise empty room, young girl, violin, center of her own attention...”) Glorified G (“Double think, dumb is strength, never shot at a living thing”) Rearviewmirror (pre-leaving-the-house-for EVER “I gather speed from you fucking with me”) Elderly Woman Behind The Counter In A Small Town (“I changed by not changing at all, small town predicts my fate”) LEASH!!!!!! (scream and jump and scream in anger AAAHH!!! i’m 16 and i hate the world!!! “Troubled souls unite, we got ourselves tonight ya – ... Drop the leash we are young, get out of my fucking face...”  over and over and over and over and repeat, play.) K, might as well have put down the whole album, cuz last but certainly not least: Indifference (“I will light the match this mornin', so I won't be alone, watch as she lies silent, for soon light will be gone”)  Vitalogy (don’t know this album as well as I should): Not For You (“Small my table, sits just two...”) Nothingman (“Walks on his own, with thoughts he can’t help thinking”) CURDUROY!! (“The waiting drove me mad, you’re finally here and i’m a mess, I take your riches back, can’t let you roam inside my head...” yummy song!) Immortality (also yummy... “Holier than thou, How? Surrendered, executed anyhow... a truent finds home, and i wish to hold on too but there’s a trap door in the sun... Immortality...” mmm)  No Code (my darling, my favourite)  Hail, Hail (“Like minded on the run in a race that can’t be won, hail hail the lucky ones, i refer to those in love ya...” Smile (such a cute song, i love it, “don’t it make you smile, when the sun don’t shine - it don’t shine at all, don’t it make you smile, this is how i feel...” LUKIN! (A little good ol’ head-bangin’ anyone? Practically inaudible... “Drive down the street can’t find the keys to my own fucking home...” Present Tense (oh Present Tense, repeat repeat repeat, i could write down the whole song from memory, i think:  Can you see the way that tree bends Does it inspire? Leanin’ out to catch the suns rays A lesson to be applied... Are you gettin something out of this All encompassing trip  You can spend your time alone Redigesting past regrets (oooh) You can come to terms and realize You’re the only one who cannot forgive yourself (ooh) It makes much more sense to live in the present tense  Have you idea on how this life ends? Took your hand and studied the lines Have you the belief that the road ahead Sends off into the light?  Seems that needlessly it’s getting harder  To find an approach and a way to live Are we getting something out of this All encompassing trip  You can spend your time alone Redigesting past regrets (oooh) You can come to terms and realize You’re the only one who cannot forgive yourself (ooh) It makes much more sense to live in the present tense ....  Found a lyrics site that doesn’t agree with me completely, oh well. The there’s the lullaby at the end of No Code which is beautiful and I’m Open is great as well ("A man lies in his bed in a room with no doors...".  I feel asthough I may be boring you all... at least those of you who have no interest in Pearl Jam.  Yeild will have to wait another day... i haven’t listened to Binaural that much, so i won’t pretend to know much about it.  Enough with the Pearl Jam.  My “other” boss said something that was music to my ears, “WE’RE GOING TO HIRE SOMEONE ELSE TO DO THE SECRETARIAL WORK SO THAT YOU CAN FOCUS ON THE GRAPHIC DESIGN.”  It was all i could do not to jump out of my chair... WOOHOO! “That way you can focus on designing really good covers and logos n’ stuff.”  My rubber arm!! Ow!!!

      Great weekend.  I like my family.  Especially when there is no talk of politics at the dinner table.  I interjected -- i could feel my mother's blood beginning to boil and her voice starting to rise and her words beginning to sound like they were going to talk about George Bush and i was like, "Can we NOT talk politics at the dinner table?"  and it stopped.  much more pleasant.  hung out with the kiddies which is always an exhausting pleasure.  the trip down was nice, especially since their Cadillac SUV has a DVD player and screens in the head-rests.  2 movies later and we were already in the Bay.  Time flies when the kids aren't fighting.  Left my purse in a Tim Hortons.  God bless Canada!! I got it back! Sitting on the top was my Yves St-Laurent scarf that my brother bought me in France (not a fake), my roommate’s discman was in it.  My wallet... my book!! MY NEW BOOK WHICH I FINISHED AND I LOVED SO MUCH!!!   Paulo Coelho’s new book, if i haven’t ranted and raved about it enough here, is called ELEVEN MINUTES – the amount of time it takes for a guy to cum/to have sex.  ya.  The subject is treated as only Paulo Coelho can.  I related to it so much – the whole idea that we treat sex as though it was something we act like we know how to do, afraid to ask “Is it good for you?”, afraid to say, ‘No, I faked it.”  We have sex by obligation, because it is expected because it’s easier than actually getting to know someone.  Paulo Paulo Paulo!!!  I want to read it again!  I want it to be summer and warm out so that i can bring a blanket to the parc, sit in the shade of a tree... relax... read book after book...  Anyway, i got to north bay, called the Tim Horton’s and picked up my purse on the way home to Toronto.  Once in North Bay I saw MY NEW BED!!!  It’ll take some getting used to, having to climb a ladder to get into bed.  But SO COOL!  I’ll have room in my room!  Room to breathe, room to store, room to sleep... fun fun!  then time was spent with the familia -- Looking at old family albums – i can’t get over how much my brother G looks like my grampa G.  It’s uncanny.  Men were men back then eh?  The fedoras the suits – the black & white photos... my grandma was so stylish.  Fabulous.  It was weird, looking at my grampa and his family – his sister is now over 90 years old... my grandma’s birthday is on the 13th of this month... she’s over 90 as well.  They have pictures of a trip to Florida in 1955.  My grandmother in a halter top.  Teehee... my grampa was, dare i say it? Damn fine lookin’!! There were newer photos as well.  My brother G pushing me on the swing – i’m wearing green overalls and a yellow shirt – the swing was yellow too.  Pictures of when my aunts got married and i was a flower girl. memoriiiiies of the way we weeeere!...  Good food!!  I love going home just for the food!!!  Mmm grandma cooking – mmm cutlets.  I had SO MANY CUTLETS.  So much cake!  My stomach is full just thinking about it.  But the weekend was quickly over.  A car ride back to the city, pick up my purse, finish my book in the car. it was so cold on Sunday – and just as cold today.  So wrong.  It’s april!! Let the sun shine and the cold dissapear!!!  Go away cold, you’re not wanted anymore!!!  brrrrrr..rrrrrr.rr  sooo coccoolld...  Got home and called Jeremy – we had a date with some clippers and his hair... but instead we grabbed a few beer and a comedy show.  So funny... so so funny...  Discovered that my 10 and 12 year old cousins know Homestarrunner... but don’t get half to 75% of the pure genius that they are... Gorbachev... so funny... so so funny...  I am dissapointed in everyone reading this that is between the ages of 23 and 30 that doesn’t praise and worship  urlLink Homestarrunner.com – now go!  Go!  Worship the pure GENIUS that is Homestarrunner.  Go!!   Had some very very strange dreams this morning... dreamed that i walked in on my husband having sex with some girl – freaked out, started throwing things everywhere, locked myself into an ajoining room (cuz we were in a hotel or a condo on vacation in France), then the girl he was f*cking comes up to the door pounding on it like she wanted to explain what was happening... and then Barishnikov’s character on Sex and the City was sent to “show me around” this little town in France... but he was dressed a little like Steve from SATC, with gym shorts and running shoes, not at all becoming.  Of course, i was seduced by him... but then the dream started getting weirder and i felt as though it was going to get violent and then the batteries on my cordless started dying so the phone started beeping and i had to wake up, thank god.  very very strange...  anyway, now i'm at work... and they've missed one of my paychecks, so i have to sort that out.  Fun fun!!  Summer is slowly approaching... buckle your seatbelts ladies and gentlemen!!  Le spectacle va bientôt commencer.....

      k, i may have over-reacted a little yesterday.  After I wrote that post, I went to the Indigo bookstore and checked out a few design books for logo ideas...  i found a beautiful book... i wanted to buy it so bad... but it was 40$ and i already spent my book quota this month.    anyway, i got very inspired and ran back to work to jot down my ideas.  This morning i wrote my “other” boss an e-mail to ask him if i could have a meeting with him and his business partner to see what kind of logo they wanted, where it would be used, etc.  I am SO excited (again).    i guess i had forgotten the best part of graphic design - thinking up something, having someone like the worst of the choices, and taking that one design i thought was so ugly i would die and making it my favourite.  Changing little things in it, turning things around so that the design becomes a billion times better - i like it, the client likes it - everyone goes home happy.  yay happy!  i'm debating whether to talk about a spiritual conflict i've been having of late... but i'll talk about a small part of that... i've been seeing a lot of  signs  lately...  (sign sign everywhere a sign... do this don't do that, can't you read the siiiiign...)  but seriously - little things, people say certain things, certain books come into my hands, certain random e-mails are sent... I'm really beginning to think that life tells you what to do if you only read the signs.  For example, when i went to Indigo to find a graphic design book yesterday at noon... i was about to give up finding a book to go to the magazine section, but i picked up another book that was facing me (some are facing and the others are side-ways, you know?) -- anyway, when i picked up that book, 4 other books fell over, "Shit!" - the book i picked up was pretty boring, but when i was fixing the books that fell over, one of them was "Letterheads and Logos" -- exactly what i was looking for.  not only that but finding this book inspired me and made me think of ways to discuss my ideas with my boss.  Then this morning i was talking to my aunt, and i asked her how her trip to Cancun was, with her kids.  She mentionned that it was great and that they had found a bar that played the NHL games (big Leafs fans) – they said they were on the beach asking themselves if they were gonna get to see the game when a plane flew by with “Pat O’Brians BIG SCREEN TV NHL GAMES!” –   “It was like a sign from God” she said.  I bought a little book called Your Best Year Ever! because my best girl recommended i buy it, and when i got home i figured i would let my roommate know that i had bought it and since he's not working or anything and is feeling kind of low and useless, i thought he might benefit from reading it.  "Everyone's been telling me I should read this book or that," he said, "I hate these kinds of books."  He started to read it a little and made fun of it.  "Fine," I thought to myself, "Don't see a blantant sign from life when you get one."  Everyone's telling him to read a self-help book, i put one right in his face and he still won't even try.  Fine.  Stay at home and feel like crap! don’t even try to feel better, don’t even think about doing something new – he’s so frustrating.  I realize that not everyone will believe or trust in my idea of signs... but hell, this week, it's totally been aparent to me, so why not??

      Just before our love got lost you said, “I am as constant as a northern star”, and I said, “constantly in the darkness, where’s that at? If you want me I’ll be in the bar...” On the back of a cartoon coaster in the blue TV screen light, I drew a map of Canada, oh Canada... with your face sketched on it twice.  Oh, you’re in my blood like holy wine, you taste so bitter and so sweet... oh, I could drink a case of you darlin’, and I would still be on my feet, oh I would still be on my feet...  Oh, I am a lonely painter. I live in a box of paints. I’m frightened by the devil and I’m drawn to those ones who ain’t afraid. I remember that time you told me, you said, “love is touching souls,” surely you touched mine, cuz part of you pours out of me in these lines from time to time...  Oh you’re in my blood like holy wine you taste so bitter and so sweet, I could drink a case of you, darling... still I’d be on my feet, I would still be on my feet.  I met a woman, she had a mouth like yours, she knew your life, she knew your devils and your deeds and she said, “go to him. Stay with him if you can, but be prepared to bleed...”  Oh but you are in my blood you’re my holy wine, you’re so bitter, bitter and so sweet oh, i could drink a case of you, darlin’, still i’d be on my feet, i would still be on my feet...  ---- can i just re-iterate how much i  adore  Joni Mitchell? A lot of people have tried to cover this song... Tori Amos, Diana Krall, just to name a couple, but no one sings  A Case Of You  like Joni.   NOBODY.    This weekend was AWESOME. Friday night i went to hang out with my friend C. i used to work with her at Aldo in North Bay when i’d gone home to work in between dropping out of university and moving back to Toronto, before Montreal. She’s awesome. We had a few drinks at her place and then we went to her boyfriend’s, (he was having a birthday party) under the pretext that we were going out to the Drake afterwards. I was excited cuz i heard the Drake is chi-chi and very nice design-wise.  Well, we ended up sitting around, but no Drake. So at 3am, everyone was going home, but i was in a “going out” mood, so i called Gigi who was still up with his roommates. I dropped by and we chit chatted, cuz they had just gone out too and had just come home. Well, Gigi invited me to spend the night, and luckily i had a contact lense case with me...  His roommate, another J, was already in bed, but he has a double bed and i like any excuse to sleep with him ( Gay or taken , right?), so i knocked on his door and he gleefully agreed, so i hopped into his bed (i took my shoes and belt off first, luckily i was wearing my comfy bra) and we cuddled.  The next morning he told me i snored. Silly boy. then me and J (the other J was in Vancouver visiting his Girlfriend) got up and went to buy things for breakfast.  Ladies and gentlemen, i daresay i cooked the  BEST BREAKFAST EVER . Well, at least for moi. but first, Queen West is the best street in all of Toronto. granted, it’s the only one i know best, but still, it rocks. that said, back to breakfast.  Gigi and his boy were still “sleeping” - aka doing unmentionable things - so i started preparing all the food... i wanted it to all be ready and still warm, all at the same time. J was my “sous-chef”. It was a masterful display of time-cooking-management. J set the table in the dining room and when we sat down, i got nothing but praise. The only thing better would have been if we’d had alcool for the coffee or champagne and orange juice.  Sausage bacon strips Omlette with mushrooms, red peppers, green onions Patato product thingy French Toast with REAL maple syrup and a little mixed green salad Coffee Glass of water decorated with a small wedge of lime... :)  We were so full. It was so good. I am SO proud of myself!!!  The afternoon was spent lounging, then i went home to shower and change (wearing party clothes for more than 12 hours is just wrong. I still had my makeup on... uk!)... oh, as i pulled down my pants to take a shower i noticed my aunt flo was visiting.  Yay. for. me.   when i got back Gigi and his boy were going to buy stuff for dinner, so i grabbed J’s Sandman comic that he leant me (the prelude) and headed to the park to sit with him. We sat for about an hour until the sun went too far down and it got chilly. So we went back and i watched TV with R... J left to go out with some friends.  Then we had a delicious dinner... smoked a little, laughed a lot, made some tea... we started to watch the Lord Of The Rings, cuz Gigi has the extended version of the first one, but then he and his boy fell asleep on the couch. Around 1:30am i decided i’d seen the LOTR enough times and since they were sleeping anyway and my contact lenses were sticking to my eye balls and also since J wasn’t around for me to ask if i could just crash with him, i got up to leave.  I put my shoes on, went to the bathroom, said goodbye to R, and walked out the door to run into J! “Don’t walk home sweetie, it’s late, you could just stay here if you want.” i didn’t need much convincing. I was tired and so was he, so we went right upstairs and to bed. Sunday morning i woke up late, J was already up.  Around eleven there was a parade for Isreal on the street, making tons of noise, which woke everyone else up. Me, Gigi and his boy, we went to the Shanghai Cowgirl for breakfast and sat on the terasse. Sunday was a beautiful day. Gorgeous. I decided right then that i wanted a little summer dress, one that would make the boys’ heads turn... and after breakfast i went home to go pee and headed back out to Costa Blanca where I’d seen tons of gorgeous summer dresses in the window.  I found the perfect one. it’s strapless, different prints, very very summery. I wore it out of the store. i went back home and then my roomy and i headed back out. i wanted to inquire about a tattoo and the roomy was hungry. We stopped at the Beer Store and headed back to Gigi’s. We hung around there for a while, i stayed for dinner.  After dinner we were sitting around smoking and there was a Spelling Bee on TVO!! We started rooting for specific kids, it was so funny. The kids were allowed to ask the definition of the word and for a sentence in which the word is used. If they got it wrong then the next kid would have to spell the same word.  They eliminated 4 kids on the word Batik. EVERY SINGLE KID asked, “can i have the definition please??” weren’t you listening at the person in front of you?? The person giving the words was visibly frustrated. It was funny.  B-A-T....- E-E-Q-U-E? um, no. when one kid got it wrong she said, "crap!" we laughed.  Then i went home... my flip-flops digging into my feet. I need to find a pair or two of comfortable shoes. This is getting ridiculous.

      Voilà, c’est presque fait, je me suis fait un rendez-vous pour mes cheveux (j’ai l’impression de me faire des rendez-vous pour les cheveux à toute les 2 minutes!) My hair, as of Wednesday, will be Black & Blue (look at me! I’m a gay rave!) and then i’m sure i’ll just go black, back in Black (look at me! I’m AC/DC!)  J’ai passé la journée à écouter  urlLink Lynda Lemay . Quelle est bonne et belle et éloquente... j’ai le goût d’aller acheter TOUS ses albums. Having Gigi around makes me get re-aquainted with the Frenchies. Sardou, Céline, StarMania... :)  My horoscope at  urlLink Free Will Astrology  (the one that appears in the NOW) says GREAT things for this week. I could quote except i’d get it wrong, but he says something like (i took notes cuz i bought the extended version, he’s so great), “Ask and you shall get more than ever before. This is a time of abundance. This could mean a raise, more fun, even your 15 minutes of fame. Normally I tell you Leo not to go overboard, but not this time. This time your wildest dreams are in the stars and there won’t be hell to pay afterwards.”  WOOHOO!!

      k, first a link to something that made me wanna  urlLink flapper dance and piss myself laughing  at the same time.  i went to see Troy last night. it was really good! i wasn't expecting much... Brad Pitt was delicioso... Eric Bana was surprisingly awesome. Peter O'Toole is in it, as the King of Troy, and gives a stunning performance. He almost made me cry.  Orlando Bloom's character was disappointingly wussy.  Boromir from the Lord of the Rings... whose name i can’t recall, also gives a fabulous performance. The next Troy-esque movie will be his, the Odysee...  N.B. - pee before you go to the movie, or else go pee during a big war scene, they go on forever. So when one king yells attack, you know you have 15 minutes to go to the bathroom. ;)  not much to report, really. My mother scared me over the weekend by saying that Joni Mitchell is dying of cancer, but i can’t seem to find anything to support that on the Internet. has anyone heard anything? Cuz that would suck.  the movie made me want to dye my hair black again. i'll talk to my hair stylist tonight... ;)

      Well, the cottage was relaxing over the weekend. It rained and the water levels were crazy high, so not much excitment occured, but i didn’t really want any excitment. I read a lot of Harry Potter (year 5) and I fell asleep a lot (wherever i was) and i ate whenever there was food around (which was often)... good times had by all.  In north bay i walked around with my brother and we took in the crappiness which is real estate in the Bay. The ugliest houses i have EVER seen. Never mind that these houses are being built where we used to play. I remember bolting through there on my bike, pretending there were "bad men" in those woods, picking flowers, building forts... those hills were our oasis, our home. But childhood is fleeting and the memories blur. Now their building dream homes made of ugly two-tone brick and ugly two-tone shingles. Families will move in and all their friends will say, "what a beautiful house! what a fabulous view!"  The trails are still there though. I wonder if proof of our presence... K, i wonder if the blankets i stole from my house and used for a fort we had claimed as our own but probably was built years before... maybe next time i'm there i'll investigate further.  My trip to Europe is becoming more clear to me, in my mind. I have to buy comfortable shoes ASAP and start walking more in them. need to save money too. ug. I have to keep focussing on this trip. This trip is what's keeping me alive!!!

      It's the long weeeeeekend I get to go home Going to the coooottage I'll eat some goooood food Beat up my broooother I'll sleep so much there  oo! i'll bring the huge Harry Potter! i participated in a study this girl is doing for her PhD in Sociology. she's studying French-Canadian women born between 1960 and 1980 and asked me questions on life, sex, and religion.   i had a lot to say.  it was fun, but it lasted 2 hours and i had a lot of crap to do at my "other" job. so i got to my "other" job at 8:30pm and had to stay until 12:30am only to find out the e-mail wasn't working and i had to ask the secretary chick to send it today... ug.  needless to say i'm mucho tired today. tired and i have to run around with my head cut off trying to get out of this city and go where the loons are loud and the silence is plentiful. mmm silence.  a nice familia weekend. oo! maybe i'll bring my italian CDs (i bought learn-how-to-speak-italian CDs) so that i can actually sit down with the book and learn the words...  nothing to report otherwise... ran into B randomly when going to meet the PhD girl at a Second Cup at Spadina and Bloor. he lives right around there and was gonna go do some reading at the Second Cup. Chatted with him while waiting for chicky-poo to show up.  i had to invent a name for anonymity (sp??) and i had to give my brothers and my ex-boyfriends pseudonyms too. ooo pseudonyms...  anyway, i'm only at work til noon, so i'd better get to it.

      i've rediscovered Janet Jackson.  but before i go into that... I went to a baseball game last night. the sky dome's roof was open... it's so gorgeous when the roof is open. AND THE BLUE JAYS WON IT AGAIN... it was really a great game.  J & B & i goofed off during the whole game. J smuggled in booze again and everyone was drinkin and carryin on...  after the game J & B & i went back to my place, my roommate wasn't there, we played Killer Instinct on an old Nintendo 64 and then went for a walk in the park to smoke a little. when we got back, B said, "can i put in this Janet Jackson album?"  ug. k, it's a great album, that's not what i'm "ug"ing.  how does the saying go? " the good ones are either Gay or Taken. " B falls under the " Taken " category. everytime i convince myself that i'm not actually attracted to him, he says or does something perfect. "wow maria, you really look good today." or "i really love this Janet Jackson album." for those who don't understand - having a  straight guy  say, "i really like this Janet Jackson, or this Joni Mitchell album" is very very rare. then having a guy you're  attracted  to say "i really like the music that you like" is just unheard of.  argh. i'm not crazy in love with him or anything. it's just that after Montreal-Ex, this guy's pure awesome. oh, except for the part where he has a girlfriend. a girlfriend who's attending one of the most prestigious schools in the world, far far away. ug. i feel like a bitch just saying crap like this out loud. everytime i tell people "i like this boy but he has a girlfriend" i get the dirtiest looks...  i won't  do  anything about it. maybe, god willing, someone just as cool and  single  will come along. i totally respect B for not jumping me. he could. however, i'd think he was dirty if he tried to sleep with me. who wants to sleep with a person who's already taken?! i don't want to be second best! i wouldn't want to sit there waiting, well maybe he'll break up with her and  then  he can be mine.  it's just that there are  zero  cool guys in my social circle, other than he. patience grasshopper, patience.  well, i actually woke up early this morning, with my alarm, without going back to bed. i got to work early, which means i'll be able to leave and  go to the gym ... something i haven't done in AGES...  argh, i still have boy on the brain. i'm insanely good at not complaining about my lack of male companionship. i rarely complain about "needing to get laid" and i don't gawk at every passing piece of ass (unless they're really worth noticing). but lately i've been feeling a little lonely, a little...   i guess that everything else in my life is going well, all i need now is a cool boyfriend. NEED is a strange word, ain't it? a boyfriend is probably the last thing i need. i have so much on my plate already, i don't have any time at all for a boyfriend. i barely have time to sleep. and friends are always the ones that suffer because of boyfriends. i hate that. i don't want to abandon my friends when i'm having so much fun!!  my "comments" are f*ckin with me. i'm annoyed.

      Going to another Blue Jays game tonight. it's Twoonie Tuesday at the Skydome... which is awesome. i wonder how many people there'll be. well, at least there'll be more than just me and Lily White Ass (aka J).  not much else to report really... bought a backpack for my trip!! it's awesome. the guy at Mountain Equipment Co-op put like, 30 pounds in it to show me what it'll be like... there's NO WAY i'm bringing 30 pounds worth of crap. tooooo much. so so heavy. me weak and little!! i'm gonna have to practice walking around with this bag on my back. ug. what have i gotten myself into??  i'm tired. i can't wait for the cottage this weekend. i'm gonna take naps at 2pm and eat lots of good food. it'll be awesome. that's pretty much all i have to say. i'd better get going soon for this game.  later y'all.

      A lot of confusion in my life at the moment. I'll start with a quick summary of my weekend, which was really nice...  Friday night I stayed up until 5am, drinkin' N' carryin' on with J and MA... good times. Saturday, I slept in and then went to Oakville to visit with the familia, had lots of Chinese food and then watched Peter Pan, the newest version, which was OK.  Sunday I took the kiddies to Centre Island. It was a beautiful day and there was lots to do. Everyone was in a good mood, I invited J to come along. There were the normal kid annoyances, "i wanna do this, can you buy me that, let's go on some more rides" when i would've been happy sitting by the water and reading a book, or going for a long bike ride.  There's always next time.  Sunday evening I watched Scary Movie 3, and it's funny. If you saw it in Theatres, rent the DVD, because there's an alternate ending and deleted scenes that are really really good. Both Leslie Neilson of Airplane and Charlie Sheen of Hot Shots are great additions to this movie. Neither of them play HUGE roles, but they're so funny. so so funny. this is a great movie if you don't feel like thinking too hard. the parodies are really good and the jokes are funny.  During the movie, my roommate looks at me and says, you got a lot of sun today, didn't you... I'm so cute! i have little red "top of cheeks" and nose... next time though, suntan lotion may be in order. J got burnt like toast baby. he said that his Lily White Ass wasn't used to it. i swear i'm gonna call him Lily forever now.  Also, my mother called me last night. she was in "one of those" moods. She started giving me all sorts of websites i could visit for the Pilgrimage to Compostela, and then the questions started: "you realize you're gonna have to sublet your room, eh?" yes mother "have you thought about how much time you're gonna spend?" yes mother "you're gonna need a lot of money" yes mother "are you gonna empty your room?" no mother "aren't you gonna have to move out your stuff? when are you thinking of leaving? where are you going to visit?" ah! stop stop stop.  i think her problem was that she's gonna be in Europe for the end of August, and i'll be leaving beginning of September, so she's afraid that she won't be there to "help me".  this whole trip is about my independance. i'm doing this trip ALONE. i'm gonna need help along the way, obviously, but i hate how she treats me like i don't ask myself any of these obvious questions like, "what am i going to do with my apartment when i'm gone?" or "what kind of backpack and shoes should i buy?" argh!  i KNOW there are a lot of questions that i need to ask myself. I’m not sure how to tell her that the way she asks me questions hurts my feelings and makes me feel dumb. Well, if i go to the cottage to see her and my dad this weekend, maybe we’ll get a minute alone where i can talk to her about it.  i can't wait to go to the cottage, speaking of which. i can't handle the city noise anymore. i want to go sit on a chair, on the dock, and listen to the water. i want to see millions upon millions of stars... i can't wait.

      helped my best friend move back to the city last night. Gigi has so much crap, it's unbelievable. next time, i said, i'm paying for movers. cuz i ain't helpin again.  so much crap.  anyway, i didn't get to bed early enough, and then i woke up from the heat, and then i woke up late this morning. late late late... that's been the story of my whole week. this morning, i woke up at 7am thinking, "woohoo! i get to take a shower today." only to wake up again at 8:35, already late. then the phone rings. Gigi says, "you put the keys to my U-Haul in your purse. bring them to me."  shit. so i get dressed, hop in a cab, bring him his keys at his house on Queen West, then hop back in the same cab and go to work across town at Bay & Wellesley... i was at my desk by 9:15am. wow.  realized today that i know nothing about travelling. how much money i need, how to plan an itinerary... ug. one travel site said, "don't bring less than $60 a day."   um, wha??! that's a lot of moolah. and it's not including travel from one destination to the next. the site said i could save by making meals (duh) and by preparing trips in advance.  i figure, i'm staying in hostels most of the time, and when i'm not staying somewhere super cheap, i'll be staying with people for free... ug. see?! i have no idea what i'm doing.  my blog page got all crazy. the comments and some links just disappeared, although they're still in my template, so i'm all confoozd. i'd try to fix it, but i can't muster the energy to care.  might go to Toronto Island this weekend. which is really cool cuz i've never been! that would be exciting! i want to try and get my aunt to let me take my cousins (in her car, of course) and J wants to go... we can make it a family outing.  I'M SO TIRED. so tired that i can't figure out what to write. i'm going to my other job soon. although i've discovered that i feel better if i go home in between jobs. it's easier for me to work a couple hours if i've relaxed at home for an hour. it sucks to have to get up and leave my house, but at least i can change, put some jeans on, let my hair down... :)  it's freakin HOT here in the city. but i'm NOT COMPLAINING. i repeat, i am NOT complaining. i love the heat, when i dress appropriately. but i'm wearing a fleece skirt today. anyway, i called my parents and thought, "hm. they're not answering, maybe they went to the cottage."  and i was right. i'm gonna go to the cottage!! i'm so excited. i'm going for the May long weekend. this will be SO fun. my parents will be there with some old friends which is cool cuz my parents tend to have intesting if not social friends. mmm real food.  i haven't made myself a meal in ages. no time. anyway, better get some work done. i've been listening to the Iceberg Radio.com a lot lately. makes my day go by faster.

      Welcome to Maria's Variety Hour.  First, I GOT MY INCOME TAX RETURN! (and the crowd goes wild) i'll give you a moment to suppress your insane cries of wild admiration.  *moment*  ah yes... i was gonna pay one bill completely and then put like $500 on my VISA, but then i thought... wait a minute. my television bill (i bought a TV i couldn't afford whilst in MTL) has no interest til 2006. VISA isn't so nice.  so instead i put $500 on my TV (now i only owe another $200!!!!!!) and i put $1100 on my VISA. oh ya oh ya.  woot woot! everybody now! *woot woot*  i haven't had a VISA i could actually  use  in 3 years. pretty soon it'll be like montreal never happened. except for the friends i still have there. that's ok though. friends are ok.  i have to refrain from buying too much crap on my VISA card now though. i have to remember the wise words of my father, "maria, act like your credit card is really a debit card. don't buy anything you can't afford."  except, of course, a TRIP TO EUROPE! yaaaay!  i want to call my mother and RUB IT IN HER FACE but i won't. i'm nice. i'm AWESOME and i'm nice. i'm a freakin god.  LOOK AT ME! I CAN PAY MY BILLS! Having control of one's monetary situation is a damn good feeling.  second, i was gonna buy myself a bike this summer, but i figured... no. i walk everywhere, i ain't goin THAT far, what if i wanna take a cab but i'm stuck with this bike... so instead, and because of my new found riches, me is gettin a tattoo.  ah yes. all i have to do really is figure out where i want it. the "where" is mui importante. i'd like to get it where i can see it. but not where  everyone  can see it, ya know? what tattoo do i want to get? not sure i wanna say...  thirdly, i think i've decided on my itinerary for my Europe trip:  London, Bristol, North of France, Paris, Paris to Bordeaux to Big Brother's in Dax, from Dax to Spain and across Spain to Compostela (where i'd get a certificate for completing the Pilgrimage to Compostela - part of the road begins in Paris - from Compostela to Madrid, from Madrid to the East Coast of Spain where i'd take a boat to Palma de Mallorca and again to Cagliari to end up in Sicile.  Once in Italy i'll make my way north, through Rome, Milan up back to France where i'll stop by in Marseille and head back to my brother's place near Bordeaux.  then i think i'll head home, unless i have crazy cash left over, which i doubt, but if i DO... then i simply MUST go to Amsterdam through Bruxelles... and if i STILL have crazy cash left over, i'll go to Berlin. maybe.  so much to see and do!  And finally,  THE GILMORE GIRLS SEASON FINALE IS GONNA BE AWESOME!!! Luke is gonna kiss Laurelai and Jason wants to get back together with her and she's opening the Inn... and Rory's makin' out with Dean and it's all crA ZY !!! OH The drama!  Thank you WB. and i think Global carries it too. but the WB has it on Tuesday night. it's on on Wednesday on Global. peu importe, it's gonna be awesome. i can't wait. i'm much more excited about this show than Friends. much more. for those of you who have never watched it, you should, cuz it's good. :)   toodles.

      oh my god  Van Helsing was so bad. SO BAD. at first, we were stoned, and it was funny - we were lead to believe by the first 15 minutes of the movie that it was gonna be a campy monster movie, if not almost a B movie, and then the cheez just kept oozing and oozing and you're like, "take a break from the cheez already!"  it was predictable, it was cheezy, it was insane.  too much crap going on.  you don't care about any of the characters, you don't really know who they are or why they're there, why Dracula wants them, why they're implicated in the story... who Van Helsing is, why he lost his memory, why he knows Dracula... it's so bad.  so bad  if i have prevented one person from paying $11+ for this movie, then i have done my duty.  it was a 2 hour Meat Loaf video. it's like they learned their lines and they taped the rehersals. so bad. the graphics are nothing we haven't seen before. this movie tries to be so much and ends up being nothing.  so predictable! i'd sit there and say, "the bad guy is gonna come up out of the rubble" and boom! we laughed, oh how we laughed. but it wasn't funny.  there are references to SO many movies: Gremlins, Alien, LOTR, Dracula, ... frankenstein, in this movie, is eloquent. he's nice, and he's eloquent. what a dork.  don't see this movie. for the love of God don't see this movie. it's so bad. i can't even explain to you, although i have tried, how bad it is. anyway, i'm over it now. it's out of my memory.  all i can say, it was better than Gigli. i don't understand how anyone could think this was a good movie. i really don't.  in other news, my "other" boss gave me options yesterday. although the definitive "no" is on its way. he said he'd hire me full time as of June and give me those 3 months off to go to Europe. the problem is that i wouldn't be making enough money til then. he'd pay me a bit less than the ministry, except now i have 2 jobs bringing in about $800 a week. with one job i'd be making $500 a week. ug. so i have to say no. i'm sure he'll keep me part time... i hope. he'll interview people and get a secretary to do the paper work. god, i don't even WANT to do the paper work. i hate paper work.  do your own paper work!!  also happening right now, my "other" boss has brought some people down from California. one being a porn chick, the other being an IT guy. i love American boys. they're so... what's the word..? hm. they're so presentable. is that mean towards other boys? (take it how you will) but he's nice, and good lookin', so ya. maybe i'll ask him if he wants to do something tonight.  all in the name of being a good embassador to toronto, of course. :) a little flirting could only do me some good. i only hang out with the typical gay or taken, so single, good lookin, and "lives far away" is good. i'll keep y'all posted.  other than that, summer is alive and well here in the Tdot! i wore a tank top and a skirt to walk to work today! if it's this nice later i'm gonna go read in the park or something... mmm... warmth is delicious.

      wow blogger! you look just like... MSN.  good originality!  oh well, at least you're still giving me free blogging! and the new templates are really nice! took me a while to figure out how to get my commenting back up and running, but that's ok.  well, i had a fabulous weekend. Friday night, J and I got together, had dinner with one of his roommates, then went to a  urlLink Blue Jays game . We smuggled in booze. THEY WON!!! YAY! good game. a few homeruns, a few errors, a few great saves!  the only thing that sucked was THE CROWD! geez people! I got sideways glances for goading the players. Um, excuse me, watching a sporting event here! I can scream if i wanna!  went back to J's after and, well, passed out. apparently i was all talkative and then just fell asleep. i can't corroborate, cuz, well, i'm the one who passed out. all i know is that i woke up wondering when i had fallen asleep (those boys are so good to me, they gave a blanket and a pillow and everything) and then i realized that i lost a contact lense in my sleep.  beurk, that sucks. so i got up to make sure it wasn't stuck in my eye, and then i went home to put my glasses on.  mark my words you laser eye surgery! YOU WILL BE MINE!! YOU  WILL  BE MINE!!! mouhahahahahahaHAHAHA MOUAHAHAHAHHAH!!!  Saturday I watched a little TV, slept a little, went to brunch with J at  urlLink the 360  for their fabulous $3.99 breaky... then i went home to discover my roommate playing video games with this 19 year-old boy he's been dating. he seemed nice enough, but he's still in high school, which is just freaky. i've tried telling roomy that there's no point in dating someone that young due to high school issues and stupidness, but he persisted so whatever. this child wears makeup. like,  i  don't even wear makeup. he had so much foundation on i coulda added some frosting and eaten his face.  anyway, we went to Blockbuster ( urlLink hey Mike , i'm sure it'd be worse working there, "Can I help you find anything even though i'm 17 and know nothing about movies and will probably recommend something dumb like Bad Boys 2?") and rented the Last Samurai and Gothica. next i want to rent the Girl With The Pearl Earring and Elephant (which i've never heard of, but looks great!).  The Last Samurai was really good!! i was pleasantly surprised. it totally made me want to be a Samurai, or at the very least, go to Japan and visit these crazy temples. it was a beautiful movie.  then i went back to J's before we headed off to the ElMocambo for some  urlLink Golden Dogs  action!! woot woot! they were, as per usual AWESOME LIKE ROCKIN OUT WITH THEIR C*CKS OUT! awesome. amazing. crazy. fun. superb.  their opening act, of which i only caught a few songs, The Midways, were also really good. so good in fact, that i bought their album. it makes me feel good to support small bands like that. they're a 60s type rock band, they're really fun. if ever you have a chance to see them, do!  on Sunday i awoke and did some laundry, then met J and B for brunch at the 360 again (it's a ritual, we're trying to become "regulars") and then i went to J's to cut his hair with a clipper. i want a clipper. they're fun.  then i went home and did some porn work, called my mother and my grandmother for mother's day only to be told that my sister-in-law-and-really-pregnant-woman was also there. so i took advantage of the situation to wish her a happy mother's day too!  i also got to speak to my biggest bro (or oldest, if you will) who lives in France and with whom i rarely get to converse. we chatted, he might come to Toronto before heading back to France.  after SURVIVOR (i hate Boston Rob with such a passion, he bugs me so much) which was played by all with great stupidity (didn't think i was a survivor fan, didj'a), i went with the roomy to Remington's for some male strippin. my commentary on that:  meh. 1) for chrissake, take off your socks. 2) MUST you wear a rubber band around your c*ck? (i know you're wondering, and it's so that their throbbing members throb as much as members can throb) the rubber band is ugly. remove it. 3) learn to dance for the love of God. i don't pay cover to come see you walk from one end of the stage to the other. 4) did i mention you should TAKE OFF YOUR SOCKS?!!?!?!?!?!  boys, take a mental note for future reference:  you're with a girl (or a boy), you're gettin' it on, it's gettin' hot - THE FIRST THING TO COME OFF AFTER YOUR SHIRT, SHOULD BE YOUR SOCKS. nothing ruins the mood more than a guy crawling into bed with you naked, with socks on. get a clue.  so ya, all this to say that i clapped louder for the strippers who actually removed their socks, or those who didn't have any on in the first place.   then my porn boss dropped a bombshell i hoped he wouldn't drop...   "Maria, I'm moving back to California for a year. We'll talk about it tomorrow."  i don't want to run the office. he can't afford to pay me as much money as the Ministry. i'm very happy working both jobs. very happy.   so i'm gonna have to say no. i hate telling people, "no. you were counting on me, but no." i hate it i hate it i hate it i hate it.  PLEASE DON'T HATE ME!!!  i wanted to work for you full time once upon a midnight weary, but not no more! please god, make him understand, make him not be mad at me! he's a good source of income god, and europe is only a few months away!!  speaking of which, i'm beginning to decide my itenerary, but this entry is long enough as it is. wish me luck on my "no" saying tonight. seeing Van Helsing afterwards (with J and B).

      DON'T FORGET YOUR MOTHERS ON SUNDAY. i sent mine flowers.  i asked for a bouquet with one red rose and lots of daisies around it.  my mom called me today to say that she got it and she was very happy about it.  i asked her to ask my dad to take a picture and send it to me to see what it looks like and he did.  the flower-bouquet-making-person added all sorts of babies breath too... it's really perrrty.  i love flowers.  a note to all the gentlemen reading this ALL GIRLS LOVE FLOWERS.  unless they're deathly allergic, let me repeat,    ALL GIRLS LOVE FLOWERS.   i buy myself some for the office, cuz, well, my desk is in a hallway and goddammit, i'm entitled.  so Monday morning i go out and buy myself a little flowery somethin' and by Friday it's pretty much dead/ugly so in the garbage it goes... i try to get different flowers everytime, they're nice.  in other news, i got a phone call from my porn boss today who is currently in California (just the word California makes me think of Joni Mitchell), and he said, “i showed your DVD covers to some producers and they really liked them, they might hire you to do some for them too!” i was like, “bring it on bitch! bling bling!” and he was like, “yo!” and i’z like, “yo!” and he’s like, “we’z goin to a gay strip joint on Sunday, is you in? it’s straight night for da ladaiz!” and iz like, “i’m down wit dat.”  So i’m going to Remington’s on Sunday night.  Hey man, free drinks. and my first ever strip joint!!! woohoo!  I’ve taken to relating conversations in “Homey/hip-hop” dialect.  Not sure why.  Tonight, i’ma goin to a BALL GAME!!

Let me root root root for the hoooome teeaaam if they don’t win it’s a shame, cuz it’s ONE TWO THREE strikes you’re out at the oooold baaaaall gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame!  K, does anyone know the REAL words to that song?  Yay INTERNET!  Yay Google, acutally.  I should buy stocks.  Google rocks.  "Take me out to the ball game, Take me out with the crowd. Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack, I don't care if I never get back, Let me root, root, root for the home team, If they don't win it's a shame. For it's one, two, three strikes, you're out, At the old ball game."  k, first, it's TAKE me out.  oops. k, well, that's not a huge mistake.  i can buy my own ticket dammit! i don't need you to TAKE me anywhere! pfff!  so there!  excellent weekend ahead:   Friday night:  urlLink BLUE JAYS BASEBALL  Saturday night:  urlLink THE GOLDEN DOGS  Sunday night: oh ya  urlLink REMINGTON'S .

      * Joni Mitchell is such a hippie. I bought 2 more albums of hers last night.  She's awesome!  Why did i not know she was awesome?  why didn't anybody tell me she was awesome?  not too sure about her newer stuff.  Sounds weird.  i'll start from the 60s and 70s and make my way to the 80s and 90s.  her music makes me want to put flowers in my hair and dance barefoot in a field or something.  it makes me want to have hair down to my hips and wear bell-bottoms and smoke weed on the beach.    how does the song go? give me a head of hair, long beautiful hair! i'll look it up. i haven't seen "Hair" in  such  along time.   Gimme a head with hair, long beautiful hair Shining, gleaming, steaming, flaxen, waxen  Give me down to there, hair! Shoulder length, longer (hair!) Here baby, there mama, Everywhere daddy daddy   oh and my favourite part:   O-oh, Say can you see; my eyes if you can, Then my hair's too short!   ah yes, Woodstock, The Grateful Dead, LSD, tie-dye (which i resently realized is  called  tie-dye because you have to tie it before you dye it)(ya.) People said stuff like Groovy and Outta Sight.  They fought the power and love was free (although i'm sure the drugs played a part in the freeness of the lovin')(a guy wakes up beside a guy... "um... free your mind man! and have another hit!")  everywhere daddy daddy  although I don't miss my hair.  it needed to be cut (like in the touching scene in Hair where the guy goes into the army and has his hair shaved off... sob sob) - it'll grow back eventually - if i want it to.  Some people compare ravers to hippies, although the comparison cannot be total. oo!  ! urlLink a link so someone who's actually researched the idea   eeeexcellent.  it's a little old, 1992... not sure i agree with what he says.  He ends his "essay" by saying:   This suspicion of outsiders leads me to one final point of difference -- a non-rhyme -- between hardcore hippies and ravers. In the 1960s, the ideal philosophy of the hippies could be summed up in the phrase, "All you need is love." Love for another person, for the music, for whatever in life you've given your heart to. Love is all you need. The song said it; and, for better and for worse, many of them/us believed it and tried to live up to the possibilities and consequences of that idealism.   I don't find this common ground of idealism among ravers. Or maybe I should ask the question (and end this essay) thus:   How do you fill in the blank?   All You Need Is _________________.    ya, well, i think the same can be said of "hard-core" ravers. the movements are essentially the same.  the "slogan" for the rave culture was/is PLUR (peace love unity respect) and the "real" ravers i knew were all about acceptance, even of the "suits" and even the cops -   i went to a rave once with cookies and gave some to the security guards.  but like everything there are elitists.  ravers who look down on other people, who don't want "the wrong kind of people" at their parties.  c'est la vie!  yes yes i brought cookies to a rave, get over it.  raving was fun.  what a time in my life that was.  it totally opened my mind and made me a better person, i think (even if i have a little less seratonin for it).  i have to get some work done, although before i go I’d like to write a little poem i thought of whilst walking to work this morning, listening to Joni:   I wish I'd never cut my long hair short   i wish i saw more stars atop my mountain i could make more wishes dream more dreams  i wish i had some crazy wheels i could see the world find my road  i wish i knew more funky cool people i could move to their music learn to groove  i wish i’d never cut my long hair short i could play the guitar sing more songs  i’d braid flowers make a crown dance for peace curl up by the sea  i’d fly away in search of her and i’d give her a lock for good measure.

      First lyric that comes on my walkman when I press play:  "I hate you some I hate you some I love you some Oh I love you when I forget about me..."  - Joni Mitchell, All I Want, Blue 1971  Made myself a couple mixed CDs (which doesn't sound as good as mixed tape, don'cha think?)... they amuse me. I keep forgetting what songs I put on the albums.  I make crazy mixed tapes (I refuse to say mixed CD anymore)...  This one has (not in this order):  Black Eyed Peas  (with the part me and my cuz Nick are trying to learn by heart - but i'll spare you the lyric)  The Ramones  (bah bah bah bah I wanna be sedated)  Joni Mitchell  (see above)  Outkast  (Big-Boi rocks - Trunk rattlin’ like two midgets in the back seat wrasling - well i know y'all wanted that 808 can you feel that b-a-s-s bass)(awesome)  Neil Diamond  (singing Joni Mitchell's Both Sides Now)  Justin Timberlake  (Cry Me A River, there will be NO eye rolling - the album sucks, this song is awesome)(so there)(the damage is done so i guess i be leavin')  Daft Punk  (It might not be the right time, I might not be the right one, but there's something about us...)(now, this song i shouldn't have put on this album, or at least, not at this spot, cuz it doesn't fit with the song before or after it.  i made a mixed tape mistake with this one.  oh well.)  Audio Bullys  (There's things I haven't told you, I go out late at night, and if I was to tell you, you'd see my diff'rent side)(AWESOME song) THE BEACH BOYS (everybody sing loud now): WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF WE WERE OLDER... wait a minute.  k, this song, the beach boys one, i keep thinking that I put it on this CD, but i didn't.  although, it's a fun song.  huh.  anyway,  Rufus Wainwright  (now, this song seems to have come from a different source cuz I could barely hear it in the car, very frustrating.)(why am i always on a plane or a fast train? oh what a world my parents gave me always travelling but not in love...)  Pearl Jam  (Given To Fly)  White Stripes  (we started living in an old house, my ma gave birth and we were checking it out - it was a baby boy, so we bought him a toy, it was a ray-gun and it was 1981)  Nelly Furtado  (One Trick Pony)  (*Note: i just got to the bottom of my cup of coffee... mmm... sweet sweet sugar...)   No Doubt  (w/ Prince): Prince loves to collaborate.  it's cuz he's good at it. (Waiting Room)  Tori Amos  (no mixed tape is complete without Tori): (Out past the fountain I left by the station, i start the day in the usual way.  then think well why not and stop for a coffee...)   Planet Funk  (Who Said): (i never been to the USA - i'm a slave to the minimum wage - detroit new york and l.a. - but i'm stuck in the UK) (makes me want to dance in the STREET YO!)  Sarah McLachlan  (Stoopid. no, kidding, Stupid...)  and um... i think that's it!  Stayed up late again last night.  went to Gigi's new place and laughed with him and Pookie... t'was much fun.  much fun that turned into very tired this morning.  but tonight i think i'll take my work home so that i can do some laundry and clean my room, unpack my suitcase, etc etc.  I'd like to leave y'all with an exerpt of the crap i read all day: "Ce cours porte sur les choix économiques auxquels les individus et les sociétés font face pour optimiser l'utilisation des ressources alors que la concurrence se fait vive sur les marchés internationaux.  L'élève utilise des concepts et des modèles économiques ainsi que des méthodes de recherche en économie pour analyser des questions d'actualité locales et mondiales et pour proposer des éléments de réponse." Intro to "Analyse des grands enjeux économiques contemporains, 12e année, cours préuniversitaire, CIA4U  fun shit yo!

      * it was great fun.  i almost want to stop writing my story... now that i've actually lived through it... it's not the same.  i didn't run into "him" or any of his friends (although i saw a guy who owes me money... but didn't talk to him or anything)... anyway.  ya.  so the trip was pretty uneventful.  i saw family, saw my bro, saw friends... walked through the Parc Lafontaine, which was just beginning to grow leaves and was lit up beautifully... it was nice.    i went to the "vieux port" too.  4 days was a perfect amount of time.  i'd like to go back at some point in the summer... maybe spend a whole week, who knows.  anyway, it was a real montreal weekend.  smoked a lot of weed, drank a lot of booze... fun stuff.  i'm not exactly sure what else to say!  i need to take another look at my story... see if it's worth salvaging, if i want to bother continuing.  i'm thinking of quitting my porn job.  i don't have time for anything anymore.  i need time to relax, put my house in order as the saying goes.  it's not as if i'm making tons of money there anyway.  i'll see.  my roommate is bugging the crap out of me.  he didn't clean anything the whole weekend.  didn't do any dishes, didn't vacuum anything... and then he tells me we have mice.  fuck  i want to kick him.  but i won't.  i guess i'll move out before i leave for Europe... move all my shit home.  and then when i get back find a new place to move into, maybe a house or a condo... ug.  anyway, i have a lot of things to do, and a lot to think about.  i don't really feel like posting today, i just thought i'd say a little something.  so, a little something.  toodles.

      Last night I got home from work and called J. “Hey Maria, what’s up? G and B are here, come on over and we’ll have a beer!”  B. ya. i wasn’t expecting to see him until i got back from North Bay, until i’d had time to think, time to realize, time to convince myself that i can wait to jump his bones til i get back from Europe.   ug ug ug. 1 beer, 2 beer, 3 beer, dinner, 4 beer, 5 beer (we’re out of beer! Amsterdam Brewery store is still open!!), 6 beer, 7 beer... pipe weed anyone? Cigarette, cigarette, cigarette... k, i really really gotta go home.  I’d wanted to pack, shave my legs, shave “other things”... you know, get ready for this trip.   Anyway, the whole time i was at J’s, i couldn’t help but analyse B, find faults in him, find him annoying, tiresome, ugly even... i’d notice him flirting with G (when he probably wasn’t, but still) – and when i realized that he probably wasn’t flirting, i also realized how attached to him i have become. I was jealous. I was frustrated.   I felt the way i used to feel when I was around my montreal-ex. fuck. I hate that feeling more than anything in the world. That kind of jealous longing insanity... i’m not sure how to explain it. maybe it’s because i’m hiding something from him, like i was hiding my severe unhappiness in Montreal... here i’m hiding... what am i hiding? I hate this whole analytical side of me. One should ask questions, definitely, but not analyse every sentence, every word... this analytical thing happens when i’m too chicken to ask questions. b-i-n.g.o... when i’m afraid of the answers i might get. I’ll go away, relax, and maybe when i get back i’ll have more answers. I may not write from North Bay... unless i have an epiphany. mmm epiphanies...   As we drive along this road called life, occasionally a gal will find herself a little lost. And when that happens, I guess she has to let go of the coulda, shoulda, woulda, buckle up and just keep going.   Carrie, from Sex and the City  You’re nobody til somebody loves you...

      for my singing class i’ll be practicing A Case Of You by Joni Mitchell. You may have read before how much i adore this song. “On the back of a cartoon coaster, in the blue TV screen light, i drew a map of Canada, oh Canada.... with your face sketched on it twice...” it consumes me. i wish i could sing out loud ALL THE TIME. but i can’t. “I am a lonely painter i live in a box of paints, i’m frightened by the devil and i’m drawn to those ones that ain’t afraid...”  I sent B an e-mail to discuss our little fling, and i don’t think anything will come of it, which if fine actually, since, like he put it, and i copy/paste: “ ... but you are right that my relationship's corpse isn't even cold yet and right now I feel like I have a couple of marbles loose. ”  Ya, who needs that, right? At least i know that he’s interested, and maybe by the time i get back from Europe before Christmas, things will have calmed down and his marbles won’t be so loose. He won’t be able to come to North Bay with me though, which is also fine because i’ll have a lot of running around to do, and my parents house is perfect for singing really really loud whilst doing laundry.  I’m so excited. So excited to sleep, so excited to eat, so excited to swim, so excited to sleep... did i mention sleep? Did i mention pure north bay silence, pure north bay darkness, pure north bay air... oh north bay. I have a love/hate relationship with North Bay. I love it periodically, and hate it most of the time. so boring. And yet, sometimes, you want boring. mmm cable TV. mmm my mom’s car. drool drool the beach. Everyone send good weather faeries my way.  3 long days of pure nothingness. i leave tomorrow night.  Anyway, I have nothing to say about the elections. Democracy barely prevailed and i have nothing to say. So there. ;)  i have nothing at all to say really, and unless things change from now til tomorrow, i won’t have anything to say until i get to North Bay. I’ll write from there. Until then...  Gone fishing.

      i have a niece. she was born on Saturday the 26th. born with the moon in Cancer, like the Joni Mitchell song Green, but under better circumstances than in Joni's song.  they called her Elbereth from the Lord of the Rings, the elf queen, and although it's very pretty, i'm sure everyone will just end up calling her Elizabeth. I'm gonna call her Elvis. i wonder if she has a middle name.  what a weekend i had!! Friday I went with J to a comedy skit show, which was alright but kinda long, at Second City. That building has had some historic comedy happen there. They have pictures on the wall of Robin Williams and Steve Martin... anyway, then we went back to J's and had a few beers, (say goodbye to no-carb diet!!!) and i fell asleep.  the next morning we headed to the movies to see Dodgeball - with Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn, very very very funny. B met us at the movie theatre.   After the movie we went to the 360 where the waitress knows us and doesn’t bring me any cream for my coffee cuz she knows i don’t take any. It was here that B announced that he and his girlfriend of 5 years have broken up. J had hinted at it, i tried not to act too excited. I acted concerned. I can say all this because i’m pretty sure neither J or B read my blog.  I have great friends.  Saturday afternoon we went to Black Market and i bought the most AWESOME t-shirts: one that says RUN DMC and it’s so small i have trouble getting into it, but hell, who can pass up a t-shirt that says Run DMC on it?? Another is an off-the-shoulder number made out of 2 different sweatshirts, one says Motörhead which is the sleeve and the body is a UL Cardinals sweat. It’s all soft, i love it. I got a GI Joe camouflage t-shirt and a short sleeve baby blue soccer shirt.  After shopping we went over to Gigi’s to pick up some pipe weed i had asked him to purchase on my behalf. We then went back to J’s and his roommate, who had never smoked a joint in his life but who had partook in the voodoo-cookie, decided he was going to smoke with us.  Now, i can smoke most under the table, and this guy, since he’d never smoked, was expecting the insanity of the voodoo-cookie. 20 minutes after the first joint, he wanted to smoke another. We told him to wait a bit, but i thought that maybe since it was his first, that’s why he was feeling anything... a little later, fine, i rolled another and he seemed to think that we were going to have to smoke another one after that because he wasn’t going to feel it.  So i gave him a super. hehe. Poor boy didn’t know what hit him.  We then headed to the Dance Cave and well, danced. J’s roommate spent the whole night sitting on a bar stool half asleep, it was funny. then J had to take care of him, make sure he made it to the bathroom in time to vomit. poor boy.  We all headed back to J’s, it’s kind of a blur, but the next thing i knew, J was going to bed and B and I were making out. ya. kind of wish i hadn’t been so drunk for it, but it was fun – and it’ll probably happen again, hopefully when we’re more sober. He’s rebounding from a 5 year relationship, so i’m not expecting much, but hey, i don’t feel like having a boyfriend anyway. If we can have a little summer fun, then so be it.  Sunday we had breakfast at the 360 and then headed to the Pride parade. it was kinda boring, church street was interesting, and then me and B went for sushi. Jesus i love sushi. Then B and I went back to his apartment where we sat in uncomfortable silence for a few hours. Then i went home, hoping to go see a movie but picked up the phone to a frantic message from Gigi saying that his boyfriend had decided to move to Vancouver for school and that he didn’t believe in anything anymore. The drama!! So i called him, he was drunk, and busy, so i called J who was sitting at home with a girl we know, and i went over and we went out for a beer.  By 11 i was dying to go to bed... and i slept very very well.   So if anything, it’s been an... interesting weekend. This is gonna be a very very short week, which suits me just fine, i’m going to North Bay on Wednesday night, yay Canada Day! B might come with, if the wedding he has to go to on the weekend is on Sunday, we shall see...  I did want to say a little something political, since we’re headed to vote after work, or maybe you’ve all already voted, regardless, good luck to all, especially the NDP who deserves an oposition position... and for all their insanity i think they’re the least full of shit. For the love of all things good, don’t vote Liberal just because you don’t want a Conservative government... if the Conservatives win, they’ll have a hard time repealing the human rights we gave homosexuals, or doing bad things to our language laws. I think Canadians are poised to fight, and if we have a Conservative government, everyone’s eyes and ears will be pealed... I have Olivia Chow in my riding, Jack Layton’s wife. She rocks, I’m voting for her.  No matter who you vote for, DO go out and vote.

      If you go back to my first post, my first EVER post, you’ll see « i need to do more in life. sure, i'm working 2 jobs and i'm trying to go to the gym everyday (with which i am having some success!!)... and i hang out with *some* of my friends (wish i had more time for them too...) but i want to do more. take more pictures, design more random stuff. watch less tv.  there's the key to life. watch less tv. »  well, i haven’t suceeded in going to the gym (ever) and i don’t really watch less TV, although i watch it less than my roommate does, but i do feel asthough i’m getting more done, doing more different things... seeing different bands play, going to dinner with friends, going to more baseball games, taking singing lessons (which is a big one)... anyway. Ya. All this to say, i feel like i’m more a part of the world than i did in January, but maybe it’s just cuz it’s nicer out so i can actually DO more things.  “I feel lost and i’m still lost but I feel so much better...”  For all the things that are  left unsaid i kept my mouth shut smiled, held back. laid my head on your shoulder quietly, like you were just a friend.  (Oh baby yooooou, got what i need,  but you say i’m just a friend,  but you say i’m just a friend...)  i can’t seem to understand what you do to me when i look at you  and you smile and the glimmer in your eye  it drives me crazy to hold your hand but not your heart and i wonder if you mean the things you say  he makes me laugh but you make me swoon make me weak in the knees and i haven’t felt that way in a long time,  if ever. if ever. (for ever-ever? for ever-ever??)  let’s see how long forever lasts.

      An interesting last few days. I find my reaction to this blog interesting. The problem, I think, is that I know the people who are reading: my brother, his friend, my friends, my sister-in-law, and certainly a few random people, falling upon this blog by chance, perhaps reading the first paragraph in case I actually have something to say.  The problem is that there are things I don’t say. For fear of what? For fear of being heard? For fear of saying something that might embarass me? For fear of being laughed at? For fear of not being taken seriously... ah! Bingo. Glad I worked that out. The fear of not being taken seriously. It’s a big one with me. I hate being mocked, ignored, dismissed. It’s happened, otherwise I wouldn’t fear it I guess. Dismissed because I’m a girl, I always tried to excell at things girls aren’t always good at, and I feel bad when there are boys that are better than me at those things. Blame it on having brothers, older, more advanced because of their age... I always felt that they received more praise than I and therefore equated being a young girl or woman with being regarded as inferior. The problem is that i’d always quit. If i didn’t think I could do it better, I didn’t do it at all. Unless I didn’t have any competition... then getting the praise was easy, right?  But this is the year I stop bullshitting everyone and myself. This is the year I am honest and do whatever the hell I want to do. My hair is blue and black, my little Octopussy adorns my back, I’m working hard to go to Europe, I’m single, happy, healthy, I have great friends, a great apartment... why stop now?  Unfortunately, I can’t go around with a t-shirt saying, “take me seriously and i won’t dissapoint you” and now i’ve realized that in order for people to take me seriously, I have to prove myself. Sometimes the most obvious things take forever to sink in.  So here goes nothin: After I saw Tiësto and Mark Oliver, I developped this urge to sing in trance tracks, or on electronic music. I jokingly mentionned it on a message board i post on, and I received 2 messages from people saying, “If you’re serious, I know some people.”   I was shocked. Maybe shocked isn’t the right word, but I was indeed surprised. The offers didn’t shock me but my reaction to the offers did. I got so excited about them, I ran home and started writing songs, I’d listen to tunes, beats, songs, with only the vocals in mind. I was scared - could I sing?  My roommate assured me I could: “you sing good!” he said, and I remembered times when friends complimented me on my voice, but the problem was this: I have a tendency to choke when I sing.  I can belt it out like nobody’s business, but put me infront of an audience, or even a jury during an audition, and i sound like crap. What would happen if i went to record something with people and I can’t sing?? I feel all embarassed and think that I sound dumb??  So I’m taking singing lessons. It feels right, I’ve always loved singing, and who knows, maybe something will come of this?! When I got to my first lesson, last night, the teacher reminded me of my drama teacher. This teacher is a little off, very cool, and she said this: I have this theory, and it’s just a theory, but from what you’ve told me I think you might agree that everything that has happened to you, from your background to now, has brought you here. I think you have a wonderful voice and I think you’ve come here right at the right time.” (Paraphrased and re-arranged cuz i don’t remember exactly).  I was floored. She re-iterated everything I’ve thought and read in the past year. I’ve tried to follow the signs that Life has given me and they lead me to her.  Now all I have to do is not let the fear consume me. Fear that I’m not good enough... I can do this. I can sing. I can control my voice. I can create melodies. This isn’t about what anyone else might think. This is awesome and it’s happening to me. If i keep at it, only good things can come of it. I truly believe that.  And if i don’t truly believe it, I’ll lie and pretend that I do until I do. Cuz i’m good enough, i’m smart enough and gosh darnit people like me... ;)  oh and things may have changed in the " gay or taken " category... to be continued.

      Well Pride Week starts this week in Toronto. I'm a little bored with it... but it could be fun. The possibility of fun exists, but there are too many awesome memories... too many possibilities of dissapointment.  i could tell you stories!! i started dating my first boyfriend at Pride. ya. only I could do that.  there's a symposium on gay parenting i'd like to go to. i'd be interested in hearing what these people have to say. but i don't think anyone will want to go with me. Dan Savage will be talking (of  urlLink Savage Love )... and well, i'd rather hear him talking about something kinky rather than, um, fag parenting. oh well.  Been thinking a lot lately about friendship, what it means to be a friend, how to be a friend, bla bla bla... so confused. I’ve spoke to a couple really close friends who’ve said, “Maria, we tried to tell you your last boyfriend was shit, but you wouldn’t listen.” Apparently, on seperate occasions, I wrote them both angry letters telling them that they couldn’t tell me who to love and to butt out.  I told them to disregard anything I may have said of that completely retarded nature in the past and to keep being honest with me. I don’t remember writing them those letters at all. Maybe if i read them again... who knows.  Which brings me back to falling in love. My biggest bro wrote me an e-mail today asking about the fuck-friend status. I told him that embarassingly enough I didn’t even have a flirting story to tell him. I’m beginning to feel really pathetic. Maybe i’m not ready to make the move, bla bla bla. Whatever. It’ll happen when it happens. Right? RIGHT??  My freakin hymen is about to reform for fuck sakes!!!! Back to work y’all! HAPPY PRIDE!!!

      For all the good things this year has brought, there has been quite a lot of death. Yesterday my mom called me to say that “mon’onc Marcel,” her brother, died. He was mowing the lawn in the evening and had a heart attack. He was 64. His daughter is living in Europe right now. His son was in Québec already. This brought to mind my parents' mortality, i feel bad for the kids... for his wife. Funny how everytime i go back to Montreal, it’s because some has died. Maybe it’s to remind me that Montreal equals death.   Found out that Mark Oliver is taken, and that someone else has been having his babies. Oh well, maybe in another life. I’m still heavy hearted about it though. Which is strange... for the obvious reasons: maria, did you  really  think you were gonna date this guy? Did i? no... is that why i’m heavy hearted?  Or is there something else bothering me... there are some things going on right now that i’d like to discuss, eventually. I’ll talk about them if they pan out, but I don’t wanna go tellin everybody and then have it not happen, you know? maybe it's just nerves that's making me a little blue...  Nothing else to report. the weather is heavy today, maybe that’s why i have a heavy heart... it’s the kind of day you’d stay in and watch movies whilst cuddling with your significant other. Is it the lack of said significant other which is bothering my poor little heart? Is it this need to share my comings and goings with someone special?  I think I’ve been listening to  too much trance . “Wherever you go... I will follow... Whatever you do, I’ll be there with you...”

      Aron Avraham Tanny died a year ago. He’d been in a coma for 3 years. I hate to remember him how he was at the end, but at least once a year, I should make myself remember him completely... to remind myself how short life is, and how petty humans can be.  He was a cinematography student at U of T, he was a goth and a raver, a poet, and a sarcastic mother fucker. He was a crazy Jew who’d sing, “I’m a Jew, a lonely Jew, on Christmas...”  He questionned his roots, but loved his family. He was strong willed and did what he thought was right. He was so great... He held my hand and caressed my hair when i was having a bad rush, coming down off E... he was there for me when most would’ve left me alone. He had this instinct... he was inviting and kind, the most open-minded person I knew or know.  D, my old Aussie roommate just wrote me an e-mail saying, “i googled mariazmess and found your blog...” – D, do you remember Aron? He was Gigi’s first real love, i have polaroids of him sitting on my 2 seater couch, the one my brother has now, at the party where i have a picture of you smoking a cigarette (for shame!) Aron was smiling, happy.  I’d write him poems and he’d tell me how good they were. I’d read his, he had much more talent than I. He had this mysterious glint in his eye, the kind that made you think he knew more than he was letting on, that he understood it all. He knew how to deal with people, how to make them feel welcome, how to make them feel special. He loved unconditionally, but with a hint of sarcasm. A hint. Who am i kidding. He loved unconditionally, but he wouldn’t hesitate to tell you to Fuck Off.  When he and Gigi broke up, i was sad because my first allegiance was to Gigi, but i knew i was going to miss Aron.  Then when he got sick, it was easier for me to think he’d just moved away, that the kid i was visiting in the hospital wasn’t him. The thing in the hospital was a fake, a plastic body, the tubes coming out of his trach and his nose and his arms were the strings to make the dummy look real. But they couldn’t fool me. Any minute he was going to jump up and say, “Gotcha!” – a few months later he did, he opened his eyes and everything was fine, he was on the “road to recovery” and they were balancing his drugs, giving him what he needed...   I talked to him then, i remember i was standing in my parents’ kitchen, i called his hospital room, talk to him for a bit, but he had company – “i’m taking drugs that make me forget. I probably won’t remember this conversation in 5 minutes,” he laughed.  I can’t remember how long after that, he had a stroke. They buzzed him back alive, unsure of whether he’d ever recover, if he had permanent brain damage. We’d go talk to him, tell him what was going on in our lives, he still looked like he knew better, that he’d one-uped us all. I kept wondering what he’d say if he were to wake up, “OH SHIT?! I look like ass.”  They’d comb what was left of his hair, attempt some physio-therapy with what was left of his muscles.  I moved to Montreal. In the 3 years I was there, I think I visited him once. Gigi moved there too, then to Ottawa. Last August i got a horrible message from Gigi, in tears, telling me to call him. Aron had died, and his parents, not knowing where Gigi was (with his numerous moves from Toronto to Montreal to Ottawa) they didn’t know how to reach him. He’d died 2 months earlier, a year ago this month, and we’d only found out in August.  There was a ceremony at the Jewish cemetary at the beginning of September, we attended and while everyone was placing a rock at the grave, we were throwing him roses. I think Aron would’ve liked that. His younger brother looks just like him, but taller. His mother looked tired, skinny. His father was in tears. I felt out of place... why were all these people crying when Aron had simply moved away?   Aron would have felt bad around all this sadness and unpleasantness on his behalf. He would’ve made jokes, held our hands. He would’ve worked that room like no one else.  When he was in the hospital i just assumed he would get better. 22 year olds don’t die. 23 year olds don’t die. 24 year olds don’t die. But he did die. If in life he was a contradiction, he is also one in the after-life. Befriending both light and darkness, truth and evil, right and wrong, he knew no boundaries. Life was this awesome thing, and he wanted to do anything and everything in it. He was a child and a man. He’d look at you with these eyes full of despair, he’d break your heart. He had this unfathomable wisdom and this matter-of-factness in his voice that made you believe everything he said, making his sarcasm that much funnier.  It was weird, when he was sick and dying, we’d all go to the hospital, I didn’t really get any alone time with him. I always felt bad about that. I just wanted to sit with him, read to him this poem i had written for him... i don’t know where that poem is anymore.  Now, I don’t want to give him this superhuman quality. He’d tell you himself that he wasn’t perfect... but as far as non-perfect people go, he was the best. He was an observer of life. I bet if he could come back and tell us about death, he would. Keep my seat warm Aron (can i sit next to you?) I’ll bring over a bottle of wine and we can hide in the afterlife together. Only the good die young.

      What a weekend. Let us start at the beginning, shall we?   Thursday:  The Tiesto night. Got home after work around 5pm, sat down and rolled 3-4 joints, showered, dressed, fixed my hair, called people, painted my nails, did my makeup, all the while listening to the Tiesto album.   We left the house around 10:30pm, took a cab to the Guvernment, stood in line for about 15 minutes (the Guvernment is really good with their line-ups, you never wait too long)... we got in and walked to the main room which was already getting pretty packed. Mark Oliver, my God, my Love, my Everything, was spinning.   We made our way around the room to give it a “once-over”... check where the best places would be to dance and we settled on the back corner which seemed to be the most vacant place. Around midnight the club was so packed we were unable to walk anywhere. It was weird that the inside was the “fresh” air and the patio was stinky.  The roommate and I went outside to the patio to smoke a J and I turned around and asked these 2 guys who were just standing around if they wanted to smoke with us. Turns out they were francophone!! One of them was from Sturgeon Falls (good god, the population of Sturgeon Falls was at the club that night) and the other was from Elliott Lake. The guy from Sturgeon, his sister was my geography teacher in high school, Mlle Dutrisac. That was weird.  There were the constant party activities, watching the kids puke on the patio from the heat (need to drink lots of water kiddies!!) the hootchie mama's in their short short skirts...  Anyway, when Tiesto started spinning we made our way back to our corner. It took forever. Anyway, we danced a little, but Tiesto was kinda, er, boring, unfortunately, so I walked around, looking for my friend N and decided to explore the upstairs a little, which seemed less busy.  The upstairs was indeed less busy (although packed) and I danced to my favourite song up there. “I was lost and I’m still lost but IIIIIIIIII FEEEEEEEEEEL so much betteeeeeeeeer!” oh Kirsty. I think i like the singer on the tracks better than the track. Oh well.  Anyway, Tiesto was done around 4:00am- 4:30 and then, to my delight, Mark Oliver, my God, my Soul, my Sun and my Moon, came back on and kicked our asses. The best part was that when Tiesto was finishing and Mark Oliver (sigh) was starting, I was in the middle of the dance floor with N, my partner in crime à la Mark – and it was nice to see N dancing and just as happy as I was that Mark Oliver was soooo good. He spun some crazy tracks, a mix of hard trance to the point where it was almost techno mixed in with some funky beats that made me shake my ass for over an hour...   Friday:  6:30am - after Guvernment (when we left Mark Oliver was still spinning, I don’t know what time the party ended!!) we went home, smoked the last J (i can’t believe i brought 3 and only needed 2! When they searched me at the door, the bouncer chick was like, Nice Hair! - but for the roommate, they checked his shoes and everything. I love being a girl sometimes!) and i fell asleep on the couch until about 1:30pm at which time i got up, took a much needed shower, and went to my “other job”.  Then i came home and did nothing all evening, which was nice.   Saturday:  Gigi had planned a BBQ and i had a camera to get developped (the pics J took from my tattoo experience) – anyway, Saturday, in a nutshell, was spent enjoying the sun. In the evening I headed over to Gigi’s and there was a BBQ, with a lot of wine. I hadn’t been able to get a hold of J all weekend, and Saturday night there were a list of messages from him, “where are you” “what’s going on??” so i headed over to his house and proceed to drink more.  The rest is a haze, literally. I woke up...   Sunday:  I was hungry, but feeling muchly hung over, i wanted to go for breakfast. Mmm McDonald’s. Instead I opted for some oatmeal. My stomach was very unhappy with that decision and I ran to the bathroom to purge my stomach of everything evil. Feeling like ass, Jeremy called to say that breakfast at the 360 was in order. I headed over there but even though my stomach felt better, my throat was raw from the recent purge and i was unable to eat very much. it was then they were talking about when we went to the pub instead of going dancing with J's roommates. "what? we didn't go to the pub??" they looked at me incredulously... "Um... yes we did!" they proceeded to give me a "compte-rendu" of the night, from going to the pub, coming home to some weed, to my kicking them out of my house under the pretext that i was tired at 3am. I was very confused, but that's why I surround myself with good people. i can get wasted and not fear for my life. :)  Sunday afternoon was spent lounging, doing laundry, and hoping that my friends might be up for going to see Mark Oliver, the-soon-to-be-father-of-my-children, at the Mod Club Theatre. My roommate, not wanting me to go to the club alone, agreed to come with me. Unfortunately, M.O. only came on around 12:15am and i needed to sleep... but I stayed until 1:30 and i was home by 2.  I tossed and turned all night, unable to sleep, perhaps due to the humidity or my still-churning-stomach... and i woke up at 10:30am, not believing my eyes thinking, "shit! Shit shit shit shit shit!!!" so i ran to the phone and called Gigi (who works in my office) and said, “aaah! Shit shit shit!” and he answered, calmly, “so how did your appointment go?” to which i answered, “what appointment? Ooh... you’re so smart.” and then i called my boss (who wasn’t there all last week and would understand that i didn’t tell her about this “appointment”) and told her that i was on my way, but that i’d had an “appointment”. Hehe. I’m all trouble!!   So now, here i am.  My throat is still sore, my legs are jello, and i am in love with Mark Oliver all over again. My friends are probably annoyed with this obsession of mine already, but that’s too bad for them.  Oh Mark, I know it could never work out between us... you are a creature of the night, you belong to the crazy world of clubbing... you have too many girls hovering around you. I’d get annoyed... perhaps one day... one day... my love for you will remain true... ;) forever true.

      I’m not quite sure what, if anything, i could talk about today. I’m going to see a DJ tonight, Tiesto, he’s awesome (although i’ve never seen him live)... Mark Oliver, the resident DJ at Guvernment, is opening for Tiesto tonight. I ADORE Mark Oliver.  He’s dreamy.  I won tickets from his radio show once. For BT (i could Link all these DJ names, or y’all could be non-lazy-asses and Google them yourselves. (K k, so I’M being the lazy one).  Anyway, so ya, I won BT tickets from checking the answer to the question he asked online (the answer was Kristy Hawkshaw who is a vocalist for the BT track Dreamin’ which was really big 4 years ago)(and coincidentally is a vocalist on Tiesto’s latest CD)... and the next time I saw Mark Oliver (my roommate at the time, R, made me go up to him and meet him and i was in oh-my-god mode, it was embarrassing). K, this story is all wishy-washy, you ain’t gettin the point here.  K, so, this was the summer of 2000. I was moving to Montreal that September. Me, Gigi, N, and R were always hanging out. N got me hooked on Mark Oliver cuz he had this radio show on iceberg.com (now icebergradio.com) and it would come on the university radio station (92.something) after 10pm for an hour. N would tape these radio shows and soon, so was I. Then, N and I discovered that every other Wednesday, Mark Oliver was spinning at this smallish club (for Toronto) called Limelight. Well, every other Wednesday we’d head over to Limelight, go to their rooftop patio (which had an awesome view of Toronto) and get slightly drunk on $10 pitchers of beer. Mark Oliver would come on around 10pm and we’d head downstairs to listen to him. He’d play the funnest trance (Sarah McLachlan remixes, BT, Sinead O’Connor remixes, etc.) and we’d dance til 1 or 2 am til we really really had to go home to bed so that we could get up and go to work the next morning. Can’t do  THAT  anymore. So ya. One week, the “every other Wednesday” fell on my birthday, August 9th. I thought it would be so great to spend the night at Limelight, listening to my favourite DJ...  R, who was my roommate at the time, thought it would be great for my birthday if I were to meet Mark Oliver. I watched him run up to the DJ booth, thinking he was going to request a song. Then he motioned for me to come over.  I was so embarrassed, like i said, i wanted to die. but i didn’t, Mark Oliver’s a little bit of a playah, but he’s entitled, he’s a DJ.  And he’s still dreamy. (no matter how patronizing he was... i can admire from afar, right?)  I actually started using dreamy FOR Mark Oliver. I always try to find the perfect word to describe how i feel about someone... the word I found perfect for Mark Oliver was Dreamy. :) oh mark... he made me so happy with his music. Once when i went to Guvernment, he played a Pearl Jam remix. That was cool.   Anyway, needless to say, i’m pretty fucking excited for tonight. I’m praying that the club won’t be toooooo packed, because a packed club is useless for those who came to dance. Useless. If they want people to be packed in, set up chairs and let us all sit down. Otherwise, don’t let EVERYBODY in. so so so so annoying.  Huh. Well, i guess i DID have shit to say today. I bought new shoes and a new shirt for this event. It’ll be especially fun cuz...  YOU CAN’T SMOKE AT GUVERNMENT ANYMORE!!  Woohoo! Which means that the patio will be packed with kids smoking cigarettes and weed... hopefully it’ll be a nice night!!

      Danger in the shape of somethin' wild Stranger dressed in black, she's a hungry child No one knows who she is or what her name is I don't know where she came from or what her game is ---- Summer is officially here (officially cuz i said so). Strange news this morning as i checked my e-mail... J and his girlfriend broke up. He won’t be going to Vancouver anymore. I’m going for drinks with him later to see what his plans are. He’d already quit his job and told his roommates he was leaving (they found a replacement...) He feels like ass. His chick “wasn’t sure she was ready” for his move there.   Breaking up is so hard to do, or so the saying goes.   Anyway, we’re gonna sit on a patio and drink drinks and chillax. I’ll listen to his woes and try to convince him to stay in Toronto... i don’t know what i would have done in the past few months without him.   When i got back to Toronto from Montreal, i was broken. I didn’t know what to do with myself, who to trust, how to BE a human being... i had become such a recluse bitch, such a loner... and then i literally ran into J. did i ever tell y’all that story?  Cuz it’s a good story: (dreamy flash-back music)... I was living with my then-good-friend C and his girlfriend and another roommate. I was unhappy, having just moved back from Montreal and not wanting to be bothered with people but being forced to live with 3. I had come home from work on Queen (which isn’t necessary for me) to go to the hardware store and get a closet bar hanging thing. I remember thinking to myself, “Should i go see Ricky at his store? Or should i go home instead?!” I decided to go home instead and install the thingy I’d just bought and turned down a random street to go to King.  J?!!??  He looked up, confused, and I took off my sunglasses. “Maria??? Wha? Who? What the hell? How ARE you???”    The last time i had spoken to J, I was leaving his house in Ottawa, going back to Montreal (or was it toronto  before  Mtl?) saying, “I’ll call you when i get home!” but i didn’t. Oops. But that’s what i love about J. Jokes were made, but no hard feelings. He made me feel normal again. He made me feel happy. He made me feel like i was the best friend in the world. He’d call me, we’d go out together, we’d have dinner, we’d go to movies, “hey maria, a bunch of us are doing this do you wanna come?”... there was no question as to whether or not i’d be included in the weekend’s events.  so you can understand that i'm not  toooo  sad that he's not leaving.  Huh, anyway, more on him some other time. we have quite a history and i have to go... work sucks these days. Thank god it’s summer... :)

      I’m pretending to work today. I haven’t felt this bored in a while. I hate being bored. Oh well, themz the breaks i guess.  Well, the Octopussy has arrived. It is there in all its painful glory. I love it. It hurt like a sunuvabitch. The ribs man, the ribs. They weren’t made to be jabbed like that. Jezus! But it was cool. J came with me. He took 5-6 pics during, there’s a before and obviously an after shot.   So, why Octopussy? Because I adore James Bond and because I think Bond girls rock the party that rocks the party... and I think Octopussy is the epitome of Bond Girls. For those who don’t know, Octopussy is  a) a Bond movie b) in said Bond movie, Octopussy is an actual girl, a badass chick whose father was an agent who got killed. She swore revenge and she “started up the old Octopussy” group of hard-core kick-your-ass i’m-in-the-circus-too chicks. These chicks rock. c) because her father was a marine biologist who used to call her his “little octopussy”. So somewhere i kind of got the tattoo because it reminds me of my dad. We always watched Bond movies together (although i’m sure it worked better when i was too young to understand the sexual inuendo).  It’ll be a while before I get another. First because i don’t know where i’d put it. Second because i’d have to find something really meaningful to me. Third because it hurts and i don’t really believe in subjecting myself to painful things for no reason. Lalala  The Voodoo Cookie adventure was fairly uneventful. Fun though, very fun. His roommates had never been stoned before and J only had 3/4 of a cookie left. Me and J took the two biggest pieces and then the other guys split the crumbs. An hour into it we were laughing so hard I wanted to die. The guys were shoveling chips down their throats like there was no tomorrow. I ended up passing out there.  The next morning / at noon we headed over to Sneaky Dee’s for their awesomeness which is breakfast. So good. So much deliciousness.   Then the tattoo. Then... to rid myself of the leftover pain there was a joint in J’s backyard. It was SO nice out this weekend. Then home to change to go to Gigi’s to go out to an uneventful club to go home and sleep... mmm sleep. Sunday i got up, went back to sleep on the couch, then the roommate woke me up and then... breakfast at the 360, then renting of Honey and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. And is it EVER a Temple of Doom! Hearts being ripped out and monkey brains for dinner... i hadn’t seen that movie in ages. Honey was fun. the dancing is o...k... the story is kind of predictable (see VERY predictable) but original in its own way.  now i go home cuz i have to clean my room so bad. SO bad. never has my room been this bad. EVER. which is saying a lot because my room is never perfect. eesh!

      Talk about major change!! The hair, is AWESOME. It’s black with a couette of blue at the front. I wish i could post pictures!! Maybe i’ll invest in making this a photo blog. That way, i can post pics... especially during my trip to Europe.  I feel so much better about myself these days. I can feel the love, you know? People complimenting me on my hair (a random kid whilst walking to the grocery store in College Park was like “Nice hair!” and iz like “Thanks!” So it’s coo with the kiddies yo!  When i was at the salon, i had to pee in between colours and i looked at myself in the bathroom mirror... there were little black hairs sticking out of the plastic cap and it made me so happy. I LOVE my hair black. LOVE IT. Regardless of what my mother thinks... ;)  And then tomorrow... tomorrow i’ll love ya tomorrow... i’m getting my tattoo... my Octopussy tattoo... aaaaaaaah ya! I’m having issues with figuring out WHERE... but i think i’ll go with “getting it where the chick has it in the movie”. J is going to come with me, so i feel better about it. I’m trying to overestimate the amount of pain i’ll go through so that it won’t be so bad when i get it done!!!  so i’m addicted to eBay. I’ve cleared my credit card and gone crazy on eBay. Sheesh! It started innocently enough... i wanted to find a good kilometer counter to train for my trip to Europe... and then iz like, “i wonder if they have this? I wonder what happens when i type in... Gucci?!” i didn’t buy anything TOO stupid. I bought a couple special edition DVDs (Moulin Rouge & The Royal Tenenbaums - mmm Owen Wilson... drool drool), a Burberry bikini (mmm Burberry... drool drool), a YSL (Yves St-Laurent) tie for my dad (mmm Tom Ford... drool drool)...  Ya.  I’ve stopped myself with minimal damage, but there’s a pair of Manolo’s for $120... which is super cheap.  for the fashion-illiterate - Manolo Blahnik is a shoe designer. *A very very famous* shoe designer. Normally a pair of Manolo’s go for $400 minimum...  So if i can swipe this pair for $150... it’s a really nice pair too... didn’t think i was this girly didja!!?  IT’S FRIDAY!! This weekend should be fun. Tonight, me and J are watching Octopussy (more about that on Monday) and eating what he lovingly calls a “voodoo cookie”. Let’s just say that he brought it back from BC and leave it at that. ;) lalala

      Un Monsieur au travail m’a prêté 2 CD: Marc Déry et Pierre Lapointe. Si vous ne connaissez pas ces noms, ne soyez pas triste parce que je vais vous les faires connaître...   urlLink Marc Déry  m’intéresse parce qu’il va être à la célébration de la St-Jean Baptiste à Toronto le 24 juin... avec Dan Bigras. J’ai vraiment hâte de voir Dan Bigras en concert. J’ai hâte dans l’fond de voir des artistes francophones, d’être entouré de francophones. Malgré que chu entourée de francophones toute la journée au travail, mais ça va être différent d’être en compagnie de franco en dehors d’la job.  urlLink Dan Bigras ... tu m’tueras... siiiiii tu t’en vas... simplemennnnt si tu t’en vas... y’est bon.  Le CD de Marc Déry ( À l’avenir ) est pas pire. J’ai entendu pire pis j’ai entendu mieux.   urlLink Pierre Lapointe  par contre, est tout un gars.   Assez “spécial”... il a la voix d’un crooner mélanger avec l’esprit de Tori Amos. On dirait un Français, mais il vient de Gatineau. On a parler de lui dans le Voir au mois de mai. Il a gagné au festival de Grandby. Il a 22 ans. Y’est drôle. Bizarre... tous les mots sont bons dans l’fond.   All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. That is his.

      Ug. yesterday sucked. got home from a long day at the office to an empty apartment (yay!), started making some dinner when my roommate came home, huffing and puffing about how he did the dishes and that he had bad news.  The company that owns my building has raised&nbsp;our rent. Yay. Screw them. That building is shit, i hardly think a raise in the rent is warranted, but hey! they’re allowed so they do it. it amounts to $25 a month and to me, that’s a lot of money.  After hearing this and eating my dinner... i finally cleaned my room a little. Desperately needed to do that. It looks nice now, i just need to vacuum and dust it. then i went to J's and Jf's to smoke and watch South Park. oh South Park. t'was nice.  A lot of things coming to my mind for my trip to Europe. I really need to sit down and make a list of things to do before I leave so that I leave no loose ends... ug. I hate being organized, it’s annoying.  My daddy’s in town, we’re gonna go have some food. I’m getting a digital camera for my birthday, it’s the only thing I could think of that I needed for my trip that I haven’t already bought for myself. Therefore, I’ve figured out how to post pictures (it’s really not that hard) and i’m starting a travel-blog:  urlLink http://wherearetheynow.blogspot.com   Go see it now. And i’m outta here.

       urlLink THE STREETS  - some of the best muuuusic i've heard in a long time. can't believe him, wish i was British. i wish i called joints, spliffs. and i wish i was as lyrically talented as Mike Skinner, bless 'is heart.  i smoked up so much this weekend, i feel asthough my head is about to fall off. and if it did, i don't think i could be bothered to care.  J's surprise party went quite well, he had a great birthday, and a good birthday weekend. after the BBQ party, we all went to the Dance Cave and had more booze and danced -- followed by smoking a spliff at J's with Jf and B... oh B. guess who ended up locking lips again. my roommate wasn't home, but i'll be damned if i had enough energy or enough courage to say, "let's go back to my place."   i just wasn't in the mood for the uncomfortable walk to my house. holding hands? talking dirty? what's a girl to do?? so we just made out frantically until we tired ourselves out and then rolled over and passed out on J's couch. woke up at 8am (after barely 3 and a half hours of sleep), put drops in my eyes (my poor contact lenses) and dragged my ass home, smoking a cigarette, wishing i had a whole pack.  Once home i hopped in the shower for a good half hour, washing away my sins and wishing i had a pound of weed waiting for my in the living room, but instead i made myself some eggs and called up some friends for brunch.  all day we did the exact same things, none of us able to think straight. what are you getting for lunch maria? chicken fingers? sounds good to me! 3 plates of chicken fingers, 3 coffees, 3 waters (i'll have an ice tea, me too, me too). sat at the restaurant, wondering what to do next. let's find some weed and sit in the park. no weed, no weed.  fine, i'll make the executive decision, let's go sit around at her house (another J, too many J's) - her dad was just leavin' as we arrived - how are you? how are you? nice to meet you, goodbye! we sat on the porch as she found her dad's weed. i rolled it all nice, even though my hands were a little shaky.  they were talking of home, i was falling asleep, eventually we, me and he, left, he's an M - we rented a few movies, Love Actually and The Perfect Score, sat down and watched a bunch of kids steal the SAT scores, until my best girl called, and M fell asleep in his chair. I hung up the phone and tried to wake him up, but i'd've rather slept so i turned onto my stomach and made the couch my haven.  soon i was looking up to see M staring back at me, he was awake so i started the movie. finally watched it til the end to see that M had fallen asleep, once again. i smiled, it was 11:30pm, it was Saturday, but we weren't going anywhere.  you can sleep in my roommate's room tonight, if you want, he's not home, go ahead, goodnight. goodnight.   sleep was a beautiful thing, and Sunday came too soon. Sat up and looked at the clock, it was a quarter to ten. M was still sleeping, he had no keys i didn't know what to do. I wanted to get some breakfast, so i left him a note, be back soon.  walked down the street to the Starbucks on the corner, wondered if i should get crêpes or just a coffee and then another. with barely any money in my wallet, i decided on the coffee, grabbed an espresso and a croissant walked back home and put on the DVD. watched a bunch of special features, it was already past noon. M was still sleeping, what was I to do? I made a few phone calls, no one was up, I finally called Gigi, he was there, still in bed with his boy that is leaving, in a month.  He was going to breakfast in 20 minutes, he said and he asked me to join him. Of course, call me before you go.  I woke up M, peaked my head into the room, it's almost one in the afternoon, you slept well, i assume. oh my gosh, how did i sleep so late, gotta go, gotta run!   I'm going for breakfast you can call me later if you want. and i walked over, down the street, to the pub where we were to meet. I took the long way, my music up high, strutting down the Streets to meet up with my guys.  had breakfast with them, Visa is not my friend. Gigi says, come over i bought a new DVD, Wil & Grace, we'll buy weed, we'll smoke up, a nice way to end the day.  and we did and it was great, went home, had stuff to do, didn't do any of it, sat down and listened to more music, poured myself a drink, called J and said, "since i'm listening to the Streets here, i may as well come over, you wanna hear this too, don't you?"  i got there, it was 9:30pm, my day almost done, i was tired, wiped out. J had gone running, the crazy son of a bitch, Jf was there though, do we have to wait to smoke til J comes back? i said no. a few tokes from her pipe and we went back in J was there, he handed me a baggy, roll, he said, there you go.  my hands were a little more agile this time, a nice spliff i rolled, to J's delight. we'd reached Fit But You Know It by the time I hit pause. the rest of the album can wait til we're stoned.  we smoked and chatted, it was a touch cold, we went back inside, i need a glass of water, my mouth was so dry.  i got the comfy chair by the stereo sat down, pressed play, closed my eyes and let the music take me away, "dry your eyes mate, i know it's hard to take but her mind's been made up. there's plenty more fish in the sea" i swoon.  the CD is over, we can't get over how great it is. finally music i enjoy, he's got another one, maybe i'll pick it up at lunch tomorrow. kiss kiss goodbye, quick chat about Montreal next weekend, are we going? when do we leave?  the walk home is nice, track 10, track 11, then track 10 again, i hope i don't get tired of this CD. get home, say hello to the roommate, how was your weekend? he looks sunburnt. play a round of Mario Kart, wish we had another game like that, we rock at it, it's so much fun.   say goodnight maria. goodnight maria.  alarm goes off this morning, good morning Toronto, it's especially loud. get up out of bed, pee, wash hands, check to see if anyone's sleeping on the couch, no, thank god. pop in 2 pieces of bread, pour myself a glass of water, sit down infront of the TV, watched the morning weather, the news, bla bla, happy birthday Ed Mirvish.  got up, got dressed, rinsed my dishes, put in my contact lenses, found something to wear, put it on, chose a pair of shoes, tried to fix my hair. blow my nose, sneeze, blow my nose, sneeze -- this is pointless.   walk to work. music up high, take the quiet Streets, wonder which track is the one with the girl singing, "go, get out of my house please" it's rough like i feel and i want to hear it now, i think it's this one, yes it is!  get to work, wish i wasn't here, wish i was still at home with a big spliff doing laundry, monday's a good day to do laundry and i need to do laundry. get shat on all morning, didn't you hear me? why isn't this working? why did you leave early on Friday?  fuck off. seriously. i don't need this.  can't listen to my music in case i miss something. gotta stay quiet, can't do nothing i wanna do. i want this week to be over, i want this job to be over.  soon enough girl, soon enough. i think i'm coming down with a cold. shit.

       Well well well... still not finished this freakin story, don't know how to finish it, or rather when to finish it. I'll figure something out. Mike also continued (but not finished)&nbsp;his story, you can  urlLink read it here .  My story,  urlLink which began here ... continues here:  (happy reading. pleeeease, feel free to leave a comment or two, good or bad.)   Bull's Eyes   (yes, yes, i changed the title)   ... Once home we unpacked the Red Bull in the freezer and Mike decided to lay down for a nap. I was so preoccupied with looking awesome that there was no time for napping.  I entered my war-torn room and began searching for something to wear. If anything, I have an amazing lack of pants&nbsp;-- always have. My work pants are useless for anything other than working because they don’t really stay up very well. When one is planning on&nbsp;acting crazy, one does not want to wear thick jeans or long skirts. No, the only thing to do was go the halfway route and put on my green 3/4 length nylon pants with orange stitching, then find a top.   A few weeks earlier I’d gone to the Black Market with my good friends Jeremy and Brooks. The Black Market sells rare and used t-shirts. It takes hours to paruse and find the good ones. I’d come out on top with 4 shirts: a black and white army camouflage GI-Joe t-shirt, the GI-Joe logo being printed in rainbow colours; a little blue polyester soccer-type t-shirt with a v-neck and elastic trim; an off-the-shoulder sweatshirt re-assembled with a red UL Cardinals logo on the front and the sleeve from the front of a Motörhead sweatshirt; and the piece de résistance, a tiny, bright orange Run DMC t-shirt.   I hadn’t yet worn this Run DMC shirt and when I realized that the stitching on my pants would match the colour of the t-shirt, well, I thought it was a match made in heaven.   After choosing the t-shirt I made myself a drink and re-filled the ice tray. I went into the living room to ask Mike if he’d like some vodka n’ Red Bull, but my offer went unanswered, Mike pleasantly slumbering on my comfy couch.   Drink in hand I headed back to my room and checked out my shoe options. Shoes are a very important, if not the most important, aspect of a clubbing outfit, since I dance a lot. I had the perfect shoes for the occasion, a pair of baseball-looking shoes, beige and red, over a pair of T-i-double-g-er ankles socks. I was ready to rock.   The apartment door opened and in came my roommate and our friend Matt, yelling at each other about something silly, telling each other mean things until they noticed Mike sleeping on the couch and quieted down. I joined them on the balcony for a cigarette and Matt immediately commented on how great I looked.   Nearing the end of my second drink, Mike got up and joined us on the balcony. It was a beautiful evening, warm and pleasant. I was getting a little nervous, waiting for more people to show up. Mike had come for a good time and I was hell bent on showing him how we do it Toronto-style.  Soon Brooks called, saying that he’d changed his mind and wanted to join us on our Guvernment escapade. I was pleased. Brooks’ earlier decision not to come had made me sad and I was very dissapointed. Brooks had become the object of my affection and I liked having him around. His change of heart made me giddy and I got off the phone with him wearing a huge smile on my face.   Once he’d arrived I poured him a drink and pulled out a joint I’d rolled earlier, in preparation for the night’s events. As a tradition, before a night out, my friends and I always pre-rolled our joints in anticipation for quick access to already rolled blunts.   "Where should I hide the weed?" I asked, not wanting the bouncers from Guvernment to find my weed and confiscate it, something that had happened to many a friend before me.  No one quite knew where I could hide 3 joints in an outfit so tight. Thinking the crotch area was best, I hid the small baggie in my underwear, right under the fly of my pants so that when frisked, the bouncer would think it was just fabric.   "Frisk me." I asked my roommate. He found nothing.  To be continued...

      i would like to talk about trust today. I’ve lied in my life. I’ve actually lied a lot. i’ve lied about stealing things, i’ve lied about saying things, i’ve lied about doing things, i’ve lied about not doing all those things. I think my karma is catching up with me.   I don’t trust very many people. i’m wondering now whether that’s indicative of the people I hang out with or my past. My birthday is coming up and i’ve started organizing my party with some friends. The problem is, I don’t trust these people to hold up their end of the bargain. I’ve been infront of people as they’re making plans, and I don’t believe that they’re making plans. I don’t know what’s wrong!!!   Granted, this particular friend has done nothing to appease his untrustworthiness (that’s a really long word). He’s done things I thought only Montreal people did, like write bad cheques and make fake plans... oh, i see why i don’t trust him. It’s really unfortunate that I have to subject myself to him, that he has something I want... maybe I won’t end up having a birthday party. that would suck. I love birthday parties. i love parties in general, really. Any excuse to throw a party is a good one. i wish i could throw parties all the time!   Sigh... all of this to say that mistrust is the worst thing in the world.   Anyway, I was reading Mike’s blog and since I don’t want to let him be the only story-teller of our weekend, i’d better get back to that story. Dunno if it’ll be the conclusion, but i really should get a chunk of it done. &nbsp; ps -  urlLink Strut &nbsp;is my new favourite magazine.

      well, the weekend is here, and i don’t know what to think or do! B is being distant, so now i’m really really thinking i shouldn’t’ve said anything – what a bitach, J is back and i’ve barely seen him... he was supposed to call me yesterday and he didn’t – i’m so mad about that. Why would you call me to say you’re going out, tell me you’ll call me after, and then not call me after??   Boob.   A university boy-toy of mine is coming down for the weekend, he may stay with me tonight... i use the term boy-toy with the utmost respect, and i also use it lightly because nothing much happened with him, but... he's an interesting fellow at the least, i'm sure i'll have a great time just hanging out and talking with him. he was my muse, once upon a time, i wrote some of my best poetry ever for that boy. maybe i'll post some on Monday.  Anyway... ya. I wanna say, "i’m gonna get laid this weekend if it’s the last thing i do" but i can’t be bothered to put that much effort into it. i’m not that hard-core horny. I’m just feeling a little pathetic. Oh well.   Oh the happy!yay!side, my girls are coming down this weekend. We were planning to go to Toronto Island, but it looks like rain... :(   speaking of which, holy crap  urlLink Peterborough !!!!! you poor poor dears! I hope my friends there are ok, and i hope that nothing of theirs was damaged, especially Art Space, which is a really neat environment in Peterborough. What an interesting little town that is... &nbsp; I saw  urlLink Nelly Furtado &nbsp;last night. It was&nbsp;really fun, I'm sure everyone had a good time, but it wasn't the  best show  i've ever been to. Not much else to say about it, really, except that it was loud.&nbsp;There were a few people that looked really happy to be there. I got my lighter out for Try, but no one else did, so i felt kinda dumb and put it away. instead there was just the flash of cameras going off... (ps -  urlLink her website  is really nicely done, y'all should really check it out!) &nbsp; Teehee, boy-toy T just called me to make plans for later... he'll be here around 9pm tonight. I'll keep y'all posted, stay tuned on Monday for the drama which is my inexistent sex life...

      i'm really busy at work these days, and i'm still not managing to get any actual work done... ug. i found a girl's cell phone on the street today, and when she called it and i gave it back to her, she had bought me a Starbucks card! isn't that the sweetest thing ever? the girl was like, 16, so i wouldn't've accepted cash, but she seemed so happy that she got her phone back, and she said, "it was the least i could do..."  i feel good. that was a nice karmic experience...  ya,  urlLink because Mike thought my entry would be on time ... hahahaha...   The Eyes Of A Bull  ( a work in progress about a weekend not too long ago )  This was to be quite a night. Mike and I had made the rounds of China town, in search of the thing no one else could find. We entered and walked through strange grocery stores that smelled like rotting vegetables and day old fish. Did I mention I hate China town? with its little old chinese people walking slowly through the market - especially on a sunny Saturday afternoon, when all that is summer is beating down on the street-vendor fish.   We were looking for Red Bull, an energy drink that comes in a little brown medicine bottle and is, for some reason, very hard to find. In a club like Guvernment, which is where we ended up partying, a vodke-Red Bull can cost $8 and we were broke enough to want to make our own drinks.  Aisle after aisle, store after store, we wandered and looked. I’d set our limit to the Dundas street lights, where we’d turn back and try the other side of the avenue. Soon we saw an herb and natural food store with its’ owner sitting outside watching as potential customers walked by.   We hesitated. Having been through a few stores like this one already, we knew it would be the same blank stare, the same curt, “no,” but I was a man on a mission. Mike was in the same mind set, I think, because he smiled at the man and asked, “you wouldn’t happen to carry any Red Bull, would you?”  “Oh...um...” he hesitated, looked at his wife the cashier and answered, “oh yes yes, oh of course!!”  So relieved, we walked into the store where the man showed us one Red Bull bottle. “Do you sell them in packs?” I asked. I was beginning to think we should’ve just been talking to his wife because she insisted, “oh YES! Oh yes!” She then mumbled something in Chinese and pointed to another cupboard where he pulled out a pack of 10 bottles of Red Bull. The cashier went on to say that at the bar across the street, a "very big bar" called Boa, they sold this drink for $8. “I know,” I told her, “that’s why we’re here! It’s very hard to find!”  She smiled like she had no idea what I had answered and nodded a few times before giving us the grand total, $12.  With our LCBO bag in one hand and a ten pack of Red Bull in the other, we headed back home through the hoards of small chinese grocery shoppers to my apartment in the sky.   Once home we unpacked the Red Bull in the freezer and Mike decided to lay down for a nap. I was so preoccupied with looking awesome that there was no time for napping.  ---------------------------  that's as far as i got. we're pathetic bloggers. i've been mezmerized all afternoon by pictures of my niece. she's so adorable!!! shall we say the rest of the story is due next Wednesday? or is that too far... hm...

      oh Marlon... we watched Guys & Dolls last night, B, Jf and I. what a great great musical.  i'm really tired, i stayed up late and had an uncomfortable conversation with B, and now i think i may have fucked up my chances at a fuck-friend... doh! i shouldn't have talked to him about it... i need to wait a bit more. oh well.  not much to say today. J IS BACK!!!! i'm so excited to see him! i've missed him so!!! perhaps things will get back to normal a bit more... perhaps!  i have a feeling things are gonna get much more interesting for the rest of the summer. but for today, i need to concentrate on tomorrow's story. make sure you tune in tomorrow!!!!

      interesting weekend indeed! i don't want to ruin Wednesday's story writing contest (during which Mike and I will battle it out to see who wins the title of best short-story blogger for weekend extrodinaire.) I hope Mike had a good time, I sure did.  Interesting developments though, in the world of B and me. Saturday I called Jf and B to see if they wanted to come to breakfast at the 360, but perhaps noon was too early for their schedules and neither was available. after breakfast (which was delicious) Mike and I headed home and Jf had called to say, "come over and we'll go smoke a joint in a park." B was on his way to her house as well... all this to say, i'm getting along better with Jf and B. i've realized that they just don't know me, and it's hard to infiltrate a friendship between people who have known each other for a while... but Jf seems to be happy just to have a "girl" friend and i'm pleased with that aswell.  I therefore retract any mean comments i might've once made about Jf. she is a great girl and i appreciate her company.  after hanging out with Jf - B, Mike, and I went to Tortilla Flats and had dinner and some beerss. (mike, there's an interesting sentence with enumeration and commas that is difficult!!)  After hanging out with Jf, B, Mike and I went to...?? After hanging out at Jf's house, B, Mike, and I went to Tortilla Flats for dinner.  after that Mike and I went to Chinatown to find some  urlLink RedBull  and B went home (i think; he may have gone elsewhere). I was under the impression B was coming with us to  urlLink Guvernment  until he told me to "have fun tonight!"  i was so dissapointed! i wanted him to come so bad! later however, i got a phone call from him, changing his mind, and wondering whether the roomie had a t-shirt he could borrow. he came over and changed and asked if the t-shirt he had put on was too tight for him - damn boy! no it ain't!!!  we got to guvernment (i'm skipping a lot of details because of this story contest thingy) and we were dancing together (the whole group i mean) and B just looked  so damn hot .  everytime i got a little too close to him (the club was really packed) it sent a tingle down my spine and i just wanted to jump him. that and the fact that the music was really drrrty... dark drrrty beats. at one point, when i had just one joint left, i winked at B and said, let's go get some air. the roomie and his friend were too annoyed to make their way through the crowd to the patio, so we went with Mike who doesn't smoke anyway. after the joint we stayed outside for a bit because it was nice and cool out. Mike said he was tired and decided to leave.  by then i needed to sit down so bad, my hips were in pain... wait. i'm forgetting the exact order in which things happened. to make a long blog short, i was dying to flirt with B. he was making me hot, and i hadn't felt that way about someone in a while.  while making our way through the crowd to go outside, the beat in front of the speakers was remarkably good, and i just wanted an excuse to be stuck beside B, far from everyone else who was making it difficult to flirt. my heart is fluttering just thinking about it. i turned to dance facing the DJ and he was right behind me and i just casually backed into him... and we stayed like that for a while... (insert porno music here...)  anyway, i don't feel asthough i should be givin' y'all the sorted details of our Guvernment encounter... we kissed a little in the hip hop room, we danced a-plenty... i just wanna get laid!!!  and for some reason, i really doubt B would mind that. tonight, i told him to call me when he got back from his parents' place (booty call??). so perhaps i'll have more sordid details to give tomorrow... ;)

      sob sob i don't ask for much, i really don't. i ask for a little good music in my life, that's all. but when i go to HMV several times, and no one can suggest a good funk/techno CD. it's ridiculous really.  i just want some funk. i love funk. the funk gets under my skin and makes me dance just from the inside out. mmm funk.  I can't wait for the weekend to begin... i've got to go to my "other" job, and then i'm headin' home to clean up a bit before Mike gets here. and then we will proceed to have insane amounts of fun. IN-SANE amounts of fun.  i'm starving (the funk can't keep you satisfied if you don't gots none!!!)... and i'm leaving now.  to monday y'all. ça risque d'être toute une fin de semaine!

      an interesting day.  i complained to Gigi this morning: "i'm afraid i won't have enough money to go to Europe."  his response, "why don't you have a fundraiser? we could throw a party and charge cover and have booze and a DJ..."  interesting... but is it doable?? i wouldn't want to lose money on it. i'd have to find a free space (a loft or a club), a couple free DJs (friends of friends), free booze (perhaps Mr. Sleeman? my uncle knows him well...), free sound equipment?? ug. this seems impossible.  i just want to go to Europe and not come back $5000 in debt with Visa or owing my parents all sorts of money, you know?  in montreal i knew all sorts of DJs who would have been happy to do something like this. maybe if i post something on Tribe.ca i could find a couple kids who wouldn't mind spinning for free/for drinks/for weed...  it's the space that's scaring me. renting a club can be expensive, and if you don't fill it, it can be embarassing... i am hopefull and skeptical -- perhaps if it is a small party? a "pay what you can" to have a good time?? get a few of those "almost free" DJs or even get a nice space and throw on some CDs??  so many questions that i haven't even considered. need to get to work. write more tomorrow.

      i thought i'd do something special for my 100th post, but then i thought, i like the number 99 better.    SO... YAY 99TH POST!!!!   whoo! that's about all the excitment i can muster right now.  last night, Jf and B came over to hang out... sob sob, i realize that it's not their intellectualism that bugs me. Jf's tone of voice makes what she says uninteresting. and i don't mean to be mean, she's really really nice and we have a lot in common, but i get impatient during her phone messages. she has a very dull voice, very indifferent, very aloof. she sounds like, and she is, a stoner. i miss j.  i dunno. i have this ability now, after many years of wondering, to realize when i am bored, and when i am tired. when i zone out on people i like, i'm bored. when i fall asleep on people i like, i'm super bored. when people talk, i pay attention. if you're talking to me and i can't be bothered to listen, i ain't tired, i'm bored!!!  anyway, this weekend should be very interesting.  urlLink Mike  is coming to the Tdot for a little insanity. It's nice to play tour guide, to do more touristy things because you're showing them around... in my case, i'm showing Mike around the craziness, because i think he needs a little extra-censory stimulation.  Mike, I challenge thee to a blogging competition. We shall both try to write stories/blog-entries about this weekend, they must be completely true, this truth includes anger, bliss, annoyances, horrible situations which we may have inflicted on one another, fabulous insanity, great food, horrible food, uncomfortable beds, etc etc. the story must convey at least one specific instance with both emotional and physical accuracy. it could be opening the door into a restaurant or getting past the bouncers at a club. now, when i say "completely true" i mean, you can't say we went to the zoo, if we didn't go to the zoo... but the quotes can be slightly inaccurate, and the names of people can be changed.   am i clear? hm... obviously, we will be part of the judging of the stories to judge the accuracy, even if we may not have been a part of the specific circumstances during the entire weekend, we will have gone through most of it together (unless some freaky shit happens and we see each other only briefly on Friday. weirder shit has happened)... but y'all, dear readers and reader-esses, shall also be our judges.   yes? no?  stories will be posted in a week from today:  Wednesday, July 14th, 2004.

      I didn’t quit, but we met halfway. I had a feeling something would come up, I don’t do anything in the office. I come in and have nothing to do, so I go home. Now D says, “we’ll hire you on contract, so you don’t have to come in everyday.”  It’s exactly what i wanted. Excellent. so now i can go home and work there, which is fine, because i think i’ll get more done (i don’t have internet on that computer, and i have all my music).  Something’s bothering me, and for once, it took me no time to put my finger on what it was. Jealousy. J has gone to his parents cottage for a week or so, and then he’ll be going to a wedding and do other things – bref: he’ll be gone for 2 weeks or 2.5 weeks, whatever. Another J, a female J, a friend of his and B’s from University, has taken his place in his room while he is gone because she has just gotten back from France and was in need of a place to stay. We shall call her Jf because she is a J and she is female.  Jf and I get along great. We went through a lot of the same things... she’s half italian, she’s from North Bay, she even kinda looks like me, which is very strange, but she’s got something I don’t: the same education as B and J.   They did their undergrad together and so they have all these things to discuss: university profs, friends they had then, things they did, places in Europe they’ve been to (because they’ve all studied there too)... they throw words like Calvinism and make jokes about Plato and Dostoyevsky.  At first I felt stupid around them, like they were part of a world much better than mine, a world of Masters and PhDs, a world full of philosophy and art history and ... then i thought... BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORIIIIIIIIIIIIING.  I don’t want to be a part of that world. I’m happy learning about certain things and i wouldn’t want them to talk down to me or feel asthough there are certain things they can’t discuss because I am in their vicinity, but i’m seriously reconsidering these friendships! The arrival of Jf has brought this all to the forefront. J has never made me feel dumb, except for this one time at this boring Philosophy department party when i started going off about Platonic Relationships without realizing it wasn’t what they were talking about. PLATOnic relationships Maria.  Oh.   i still shake my head at that one, and i still have no idea what it means. And quite frankly my dear, i don’t give a damn. I’m hanging out with all these brilliant university graduates, and for a moment i think, “i coulda been a contender” (rest his soul), but these are things that life didn’t give me... but this begs the question... what do I have, that they don’t?  Now we get stoned and they go off talking about how Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a Calvinists response to bla bla bla bla and i just zone out and miss J terribly. He stared coldly at them when they did that too. Who cares about art and philosophy when you’re stoned? Apparently they do!  These people study while i would rather innovate. I know i know, the best innovators were those who studied the masters... more bullshit. To realize the way the world has worked, thought, and done things is one thing. To study it to death, to really try to understand what they were thinking, how their society worked... it’s just not for me.  The idea that you need to “understand” the past to forge a future is silly. It doesn’t take much to understand the world around you. To understand the histories of other cultures is to look back at ages of war, bitterness, victimization, violence, art, and death. Peoples have either felt that they were "chosen" or that they were "beaten".  Also, to me, (like Mike was saying about fantasy books) a boring philosophy book is badly written. “Dumbing something down,” as my friend Z perfectly explained, “is proving that you understand your subject perfectly and can explain it to a 10 year old. Just because you’re making something accessible doesn’t mean the other person’s too stupid to understand. It means that YOU fully understand what you’re doing, and can find other ways of explaining it. Don’t just say, ‘you wouldn’t understand’ cuz that makes you dumb.”  Amen sister. I can understand philosophy, medicine, physics, chemistry... i just don’t know, off the top of my head, the basis of Calvinism (i’m using that example a lot because it’s the last one they used and it’s bugging me)... and it blows my mind that people can make a career out of teaching it.  Anyway, that was my little rant. I think (as i realized whilst peeing) that from now on i’m gonna make smart-ass remarks everytime they talk about something smart. For example, “bla bla bla Calvinist something or other.” – what? Like Calvin & Hobbes? They’ll giggle, but they won’t realize that I don’t get it. They’ll think it’s funny, but they won’t understand that I don’t understand. It’s so normal for them, it’s B’s life, it’s what he does for a living, he studies Russian philosophy... i’m dissapointed, i didn’t really know this side of him... "qui s'assemble se ressemble" but i don't resemble them, do i?  I could go online and read up about Calvinism, maybe I will because it could be interesting to see if the Willy Wonka thing is true, maybe in my spare time...   this girl has invaded my space and is taking my place. I’m eager for J to get back because I’m realizing that he’s my friend, not B... B’s a gentleman, which is really great, but he ain’t my type. I’m afraid though, afraid that it'll never be the same with J, that it’ll be different now that this girl is here... but it’s too soon to tell, maybe i’m freaking out over nothing.  This is getting long, but I want to talk about one more thing. I’ve realized that I do something, although I’m not quite sure why... I drop everything for people. Maybe it’s that my priorities are in certain places, I’d rather go see friends than clean my bathroom, but i really need to spend more time doing things at home. Like practice my singing, do stuff on the computer. maybe now that i don’t have to rush to work all the time after work... maybe things will be better.  Europe will put all this into perspective, right?  The weather is heavy, it’s making me anxious, depressed, my body is looking for a reason that it’s so hard to breathe... calm down body, it’s not your brain, it’s your lungs... it’s the ick in the air.

      thank GOD soccer is over.  when Gigi and I were heading out of the city on Wednesday night, we encountered a random parade happening for the Portugese winning of a soccer game.  i hate soccer. i hate parades when i'm trying to get somewhere. i hate random honking. it took us an hour to get to the 400. that's just wrong.  the trip itself was great. We left around 8pm (once we were through the stupid soccer people) and the traffic was good, a few slow-downs but nothing major.  We got to North Bay around 11:30pm and we stayed up with Gigi’s dad and gf until about 3am. we got really drunk. Gigi’s dad is pretty sick, so it kinda pissed me off that he was drinking so much. But hey, not my problem, right?? Ug. Anyway...  Thursday was Canada Day, so they were preparing a big feast. I got to light fireworks which awoke the little pyro in me... i love fireworks. The moon was full and amazing on the lake. Oh the lake. We went swimming everyday, once if not twice, we went night swimming on Canada Day. I have a great tan.  I was feeling a little low that Canada Day night, i hadn’t really had the time to be alone and that’s really what i look forward to most in North Bay, is the boredom and the alone-ness.  So when the drunkenness which was Z and Gigi went to bed, i stayed up and sat by the fire and watched the moon setting on the lake. Beautiful. By then it was 5am though, and Gigi was so drunk he was snoring like a craaaaazy muthafucka, so i slept on the couch.  Anyway, i did 7 or 8 loads of laundry, ate good food, had good conversation, read a book!! I had time to read a whole book. K, it WAS Douglas Coupland which is super easy to read, but that’s why i adore him, and that’s why i was able to gobble Hey Nostradamus right up.  Before we left we headed to Greco's for some deeeelicious grub, and we brought a pizza home with us. mmm...  We got back Saturday night, to miss the Sunday traffic, which worked very well, and Saturday night i met up with J-S at the Dance Cave, saw a boy i hadn’t seen in a loooooong time. the boy who’s responsible that i’m back in toronto. He’s nuts. But i love him. He’s so nuts. I used to have the hugest crush on him!!! he gorgeous, über-genius, and fun to be around. Oh, and he’s a good shopper.  Sunday, i actually bothered to watch the boring-ness which was the Greece/Portugal soccer game. Yawn. And then B and G and I went to see Spiderman 2. i recommend it, it was really really fun. what a muggy day Sunday was. Welcome to Toronto summers. No jackets required. Hooowee! Everyday has some hot summer rain, it’s so humid and hard to breathe... NOW the summer has officially begun. 2 full months of this is enough to make anybody beg for winter.  The never-ending cycle of life.  Anyway, this week i’m quitting my porn job. fuck it. i’m tired, it’s summer, i’m not making that much money, and i have shit to do. a friend said i could always tutor English, i’d probably make more money. that sounds cool, i might actually try it. i can’t wait to quit this job.  B lent me the Illiad. Hehe. Ya. from Douglas Coupland to Greek literature. I dunno about this one. i’m just glad i did laundry. I’m clean again i’m clean again!!  I sent some song ideas to a DJ who asked me for some input. i e-mailed him my ideas and told him that it might be easier if we talk on the phone or something... i’m so nervous. What if he doesn’t like my ideas? Or my voice!!? this is the big test. i have to stay confident, forget my nerves and just do what i gotta do!!! live the dream baby, live the dream!!!

       I keep my eyes wide open so that the bad dreams won’t come again. I try to stare straight forward to tire my eyes except the posters on my wall create the image of an evil face staring back at me, wants to eat me, kill me. My blanket is wrapped around my leg in an unnatural manner and I can’t untangle it.   Sigh. I should not have had that cup of coffee with dinner.  I stare at the clock, trying to decifer the red blur infront of my eyes. I squint, 2am. I rearrange my pillows, throw the blanket aside, flop on one side, then the other, and finally find a comfortable position. My eyes get heavier as I smile to myself. Finally I’ll be able to get to sleep.  The fan is especially loud. I get up to turn it down a notch and squint at the alarm clock again. 4:35am. ug. I lie on my side and consider my pounding heart. This imminent trip to Europe is stressing me out. I consider everything that could go wrong: missing a flight, getting lost in a city, getting things stolen.  I stop myself, I can’t worry so much about something that hasn’t happened yet. So I begin to stress about more pressing issues: quitting my job, finding someone to sublet my apartment, saving enough money to go away.  Stop, I think to myself, I’m not helping matters. I remember this kind of stress in highschool and thought that maybe I should see someone, a psychologist, to talk about my stresses, to help guide me in my life, my life after my trip.  I’m only thinking like this because I haven’t gotten any sleep. I’ll feel better in the morning. I’ll be able to consider my options in the morning, after some sleep.  I glance again at the clock. Faaaaaaaack. 6am. I want to cry. I put on my glasses and look out the window. The sun isn’t yet up, there’s a thick haze over the city. I should take a picture of it, but that would mean getting up out of bed and I’m not quite ready to do that.  I try to remember my nightmare but can’t. Around 6:30 I decide to try and sleep on the couch, stay there until 7am and then pour myself a bowl of my roommate’s cereal, he won’t mind.  I watch a bit of breakfast television and figure out some sort of outfit to wear. I pack a few CDs into my purse, grab a bag of things I’d borrowed from a friend at work, and head out the door.   I’ve made it to the elevator when I realize I’m not wearing any deoderant. I decide to run back to the apartment and put some on. While I’m re-locking the door to the apartment, so is my neighbour and she heads to the elevator whose down-button I’ve already pushed.  I hear the door slide open and yell "wait!" only to hear the door close again before I’ve rounded the corner.   Bitch.  I finally get to the first floor to see the same woman waiting for something at the front of the building. I glare down her neck and she turns to look at me with the most innocent of smiles. Good morning.  I pounce on her little body, grab her head and slam it into the concrete shoulder between the building and the pretty flower garden around it.   A sharp crack is heard and her eyes suddenly go blank. I can’t seem to stop slamming her head against the shoulder. Her body stops convulsing and her flip-flop sandal suddenly goes flying. I inhale deeply and exhale with my eyes closed.  I wipe a bit of blood from my cheek, get up and walk away, feeling a bit less stressed. I reach into my purse and pull out my discman. The sun is out by now and the wind is blowing quite hard so I zip up my jacket, put in my earphones, and head out into the city.  ---------------------  had i met the bitch downstairs i might've killed her. gr. zero patience today, see above for reason why. screw y'all.

       Today I turn 25. I’ve been thinking about what that means, about what being 25 means to me. I’m still not sure. People have been calling me all morning, "Happy birthday Maria! Have a good year!"  That makes me happy.  Friday night I hung out with Gigi and his roommates and we smoked up and watched TV. Then I went to the Phoenix for some drunken fun with J, B, and some other people. J forgot he was doing the no-carb thing and he was on his 4th beer by the time he noticed. Oops. Saturday night I went to Gigi’s for a BBQ. It seemed that everyone I loved most in the world was sitting there, around me. That also made me happy. To look around and see nothing but friends. Nothing but people I can stand to be around. That’s great.  When dinner was ready, I wasn’t too hungry and before long I was drunk as a skunk (wonder where that expression came from??) – and to make a long story short, I don’t remember much from my night at Lüb, but I hear I had a great time, I really enjoyed the music, and I puked at the end of the night. On the patio. ya. not embarassed.  Woke up with a killer hangover on Jgirl’s couch. Don’t know how I got there. Needless to say I may never live that one down... and note to self: EAT before you drink yourself into oblivion...  Twenty five. So, what DOES that mean?? Older? Wiser? Better Looking?? Haha... none of the above?  My mother called me from France (she’s visiting her new granddaughter) and said, "Tu peux pu faire de p’tite niaiserie maintenant" as if I ever did. I made some mistakes, I’ll admit to that, but I can’t just stop making them, now can I? is that it? After 25, no more mistakes?? No soup for me?  Ya, right.  Got nice presents for my birthday. My grandma called me this morning, and I quote: "I’ll get your father to put the usual amount in your bank account." I’m not sure what that means. Oo! I’ll check my bank account and find out! shall we? Woohoo! $100 right from my grandma to my VISA. Thanks Grandma. "The usual amount," she’s funny.  B got me a Swiss Army knife, which is nice because I don’t have one, and the one he got me is bright orange! J says that "my gift is one its way" which means he got it on the internet – he says i’ll FREAK when i see it. can’t wait!! Yet another J made me some mixed-CDs (those are so great), R got me some soap (are you trying to tell me something???), i got some lighters (Molson Canadian lighters) from Jf, and Gigi threw me the party which was  awesome , oh and Gigi’s boyfriend got me a Sea Shell bra... ( see pic below!!! )  Ya, isn’t that AWESOME??  I can die now.  But i don’t want to. i’ve got another 75 years ahead of me... I don’t know my futur after this weekend - huh - and i don’t want to...  Home work: go listen to Björk’s  urlLink Big Time Sensuality  right now. It is my birthday, i am the Queen of the World, and I say so. Dancing around to it is optional.  Go.

       Now, I’ve been to Mexico more than my fair share. True, I hit only the tourist spots: Cancun, Puerto Vallarta... and surrounding areas. During my visits there, I went out a lot, but there were always more Americans than Mexicans at the bars I went to, and when there were Mexicans, I didn’t find them attractive. I’ve had girlfriends save me from the arms of touchy-feely mexicans several times.  On Tuesday night, yet another freakin J (too many Js!!!!!) invited me to join her and her father for their condo picnic. "Free food and drinks!" she said. It was all the convincing I needed. When I awoke Wednesday morning, I wasn’t so sure I wanted to go. I was fearing the usual mundane forced conversation of large groups of random people. It was raining, so my hopes of cancellation were in the works.  When I got to work and asked what would happen in case of rain, J was quick to point out that the BBQ would be moved to a rain-safe area. Having conceeded to this BBQ, I got excited about it since she lives in the village and no party in the village is ever boring.   She finishes work before I do, so I trotted over to her place around 5pm. I went up and knocked and her, her father, and I went down to the BBQ. There was a Wizard of Oz theme and there was great food and it was good fun.  Later in the evening, J was talking to a lady with which we work. Said lady was accompanied by a young looking mexican. He seemed nice enough, but I didn’t really talk to him until J motioned me over and said, "Maria, this is Alex." We chatted for a little bit, him, J and I were marvelling at how much the Spanish language was like French.  Later still, Alex says, "I have to meet some friends, would you two like to come?"  A quick change and we were all out the door.  Anyway, to make a long story short, when we got to the club, his friends were gorgeous. I’ve never seen such good looking Mexicans. And MAN! Could they ever MOVE!!!! i wish all men could move like that. They all had rythm, they were all polite, hot... me and J were in heaven. We danced until 1am and we left with thoughts of Latin lovers... the problem is that they’re so young! I was happy when I discovered that my crush is 19... because J’s crush is 17!!! ew. Anyway, we may see them again, we may not, hopefully yes... ;)  Last night, Gigi, S and I went for drinks at a very nice place called Loft on King West. I had Mac & Cheese B la chichi and too many drinks. I feel a cold coming on and all i can think is... hold off til Sunday to get sick!! I wore the wrong shoes last night and now my ankles are shaved to the bone. Ow ow ow ow ow... i put on like 4 bandages and 2 pairs of socks so that i could put on a pair of shoes.  Now it’s Friday, 2pm, the birthday weekend is about to begin. Twenty-five. Twenty-five. 25. that’s a pretty big number my friends. I’m not sure what I think about the whole thing.  When my cousin Nick called me and asked how old i’d be I said, "I’ll be 25! I think that means I’m not allowed to play with you anymore..." - "Well, can you still play video games?"  Hell YA! Yay Mario Kart! I’m so excited! ok, i guess i'm not that old... ;P  Have a good weekend y’all. Happy birthday to me! Happy birthday to my mommy (today! 62!! Now THAT’s old)! Happy birthday to Whitney Houston (same birthday as me... shut up she’s awesome)...   Going to buy a digital camera now. Fun stuff yo.

       I had a great weekend in Montreal. The drive there was stooooopid and traffic-full, but the inside of the car was pleasant enough with B and Jf chatting with me or us just listening to music. It was nice to see my brother and his new place. I partook in a few fun activities with old friends.    Especially enjoyed le Picnik Électronik at the parc Jean-Drapeau. Beautiful day, good music, nice atmosphere... I’d totally go back, if I were going back to Montreal this summer... oh well.   The weekend was pretty unconsequential. Fun, but unconsequential. Oh, except for the fact that i’ve decided to stop persuing B. Screw it. I’m not in love with him and it’s taking too long for him to become my fuck friend, so screw it.    My work is a funny place. We have these key passes that let us get on and off our specific floor. Since my desk is near the door, whenever someone forgets their key, i am often the one to open it. Anyway, whenever I go to lunch or anywhere out of the building, I take my key pass and put it in my purse so not to have it dangling around my neck, you know? But when I come back to my desk, in a hurry to go to the bathroom, I often forget to put the key pass back on, whereby locking myself out of my hallway and also locking myself out of the bathroom area.   It’s annoying. I have to find someone to unlock the door so that I can get the freaking piece of plastic so that I can finally go to the bathroom. Ya.   Now the office bathroom is an interesting area. All these little annoyances. Sometimes one must poo in the office restroom. However, when there are other patrons in said restroom, one does not want the occupants to smell and or hear said poo. Also, I feel asthough my pee lasts longer than anyone elses, which is to say, if I were to sit down at the same time as another lady, and we were to begin peeing at the same moment, I take longer, much longer to finish. I call it, the never ending pee.   When I’m not in the bathroom, I’m playing internet games or reading blogs... I really need to get some work done, this is BRUTAL. Just in case y’all are like me...  urlLink SuperArcade  is awesome.    We’re going to see  urlLink The Village  tonight. I’m scared just thinking about it, although the critics aren’t being very nice. More news on that tomorrow.   Life is a strange thing. I’ll be 25 in less than a week. In less than a week, I will commence my 26th year on this planet. I look at my 90 some  year old grandmother and think, "honey, you ain’t seen nothin’ yet." I’ve barely begun. If the lives of the women around me are any indication, I’ll live 4 times 25...   Makes me think, you know? About my future and what it has in store... it’s only the beginning my friends... only the beginning... don't smoke too much crack y'all... bad for the brain. ;)
