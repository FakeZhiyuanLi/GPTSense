      I just got back from Shrek 2!  It was so funny!!!! It made me laugh so much, and now i am a little happier again.  Earlier today I was feeling really mad, and depressed.  I just wanted to be alone, and I am sorry for that.  I kind of felt like Shrek, but now that I have seen the movie, I realize that love comes to even ogers and it will come to me one day. I apoligize if I was mean, but i didn't feel too happy at the time.  But do not fear for Pussy in Boots is here!  Lol.  Now I am feeling a lot better, and I am ready to finish out the school year!!  I really hope i can have some sort of a get together, as an end of the year celebration.  I'm so happy, b/c i was invited to a party! (In the words of lindsay- WOOT! lol)   Anyways.......... It is kinda late for a school night, (not really, but my mom is making me go to bed, lol) so i will post more tomorrow.  Please show me that you are out there, and that you care by commenting!  Later  Eric "The Tuba Man" Morrison

      Today has been a really crappy day.......  I don't know why it has been crappy, but it just has...... I guess it is because it was a B-day today. I really truely hate B-days, with a Passion!  I feel really sucky right now, not only physically, but mentally.  I wish I could talk to someone.......  AIM---- Tubaman1789  There is My SN, please talk to me  Eric

      Hey,  I am procrastinating by writing this, lol. I have to write this Goal Speech for Speech Class. I have no clue what to write!  Seriously, I mean isn't everyone's goal to finish High school and go to college right now? I really don't know what I want to do with my life right now.  I now that one day, if I ever can find the right girl, (which probably wont be for a long long time)I will get married, and start a family, and be a nice guy, and a good citizen. But thats all that I have planned for now.  How am I supposed to know what I am supposed to do with my life!!!!! I am only a freshman in high school!  Anyways..........  At least I have the Choir Banquet to look forward to......I guess it will be fun, but yet again it just brings up the fact that I don't have a girlfriend! Right now I really actually don't want a girlfriend, but for some reasons I kinda do. I know that they are a pain and everything, but I really wish I had someone that I could always hang out with and talk to.  Many people say that I should just talk to all of my friends, but to tell you the truth, Sometimes all of my friends act like real jerks.  Im not talking about all of my friends, all of the time, but I just get pissed because I don't necessarily have a "Best Friend."  I know that I am pretty popular, and that I am kinda lucky because I have "A lot" of friends, but ALOT OF FRIENDS isn't necessarily better than a couple really good friends..............  Anyways..... I have procrastinated enough already, I really need to get back to (or........Ahem Start...) MY OUTLINE!   Please tell me what you think, I would appreciate it.    And I apologize if you hated the fact that you just read this whole thing, and all that I have been doing is rambling on and on.... Lol  ~Eric

       Ode to the Nice Guys   This rant was written for the Wharton Undergraduate Journal    This is a tribute to the nice guys. The nice guys that finish last, that never become more than friends, that endure hours of whining and bitching about what assholes guys are, while disproving the very point. This is dedicated to those guys who always provide a shoulder to lean on but restrain themselves to tentative hugs, those guys who hold open doors and give reassuring pats on the back and sit patiently outside the changing room at department stores. This is in honor of the guys that obligingly reiterate how cute/beautiful/smart/funny/sexy their female friends are at the appropriate moment, because they know most girls need that litany of support. This is in honor of the guys with open minds, with laid-back attitudes, with honest concern. This is in honor of the guys who respect a girl’s every facet, from her privacy to her theology to her clothing style.  This is for the guys who escort their drunk, bewildered female friends back from parties and never take advantage once they’re at her door, for the guys who accompany girls to bars as buffers against the rest of the creepy male population, for the guys who know a girl is fishing for compliments but give them out anyway, for the guys who always play by the rules in a game where the rules favor cheaters, for the guys who are accredited as boyfriend material but somehow don’t end up being boyfriends, for all the nice guys who are overlooked, underestimated, and unappreciated, for all the nice guys who are manipulated, misled, and unjustly abandoned, this is for you.  This is for that time she left 40 urgent messages on your cell phone, and when you called her back, she spent three hours painstakingly dissecting two sentences her boyfriend said to her over dinner. And even though you thought her boyfriend was a chump and a jerk, you assured her that it was all ok and she shouldn’t worry about it. This is for that time she interrupted the best killing spree you’d ever orchestrated in GTA3 to rant about a rumor that romantically linked her and the guy she thinks is the most repulsive person in the world. And even though you thought it was immature and you had nothing against the guy, you paused the game for two hours and helped her concoct a counter-rumor to spread around the floor. This is also for that time she didn’t have a date, so after numerous vows that there was nothing “serious” between the two of you, she dragged you to a party where you knew nobody, the beer was awful, and she flirted shamelessly with you, justifying each fit of reckless teasing by announcing to everyone: “oh, but we’re just friends!” And even though you were invited purely as a symbolic warm body for her ego, you went anyways. Because you’re nice like that.   The nice guys don’t often get credit where credit is due. And perhaps more disturbing, the nice guys don’t seem to get laid as often as they should. And I wish I could logically explain this trend, but I can’t. From what I have observed on campus and what I have learned from talking to friends at other schools and in the workplace, the only conclusion I can form is that many girls are just illogical, manipulative bitches. Many of them claim they just want to date a nice guy, but when presented with such a specimen, they say irrational, confusing things such as “oh, he’s too nice to date” or “he would be a good boyfriend but he’s not for me” or “he already puts up with so much from me, I couldn’t possibly ask him out!” or the most frustrating of all: “no, it would ruin our friendship.” Yet, they continue to lament the lack of datable men in the world, and they expect their too-nice-to-date male friends to sympathize and apologize for the men that are jerks. Sorry, guys, girls like that are beyond my ability to fathom. I can’t figure out why the connection breaks down between what they say (I want a nice guy!) and what they do (I’m going to sleep with this complete ass now!). But one thing I can do, is say that the nice-guy-finishes-last phenomenon doesn’t last forever. There are definitely many girls who grow out of that train of thought and realize they should be dating the nice guys, not taking them for granted. The tricky part is finding those girls, and even trickier, finding the ones that are single.   So, until those girls are found, I propose a toast to all the nice guys. You know who you are, and I know you’re sick of hearing yourself described as ubiquitously nice. But the truth of the matter is, the world needs your patience in the department store, your holding open of doors, your party escorting services, your propensity to be a sucker for a pretty smile. For all the crazy, inane, absurd things you tolerate, for all the situations where you are the faceless, nameless hero, my accolades, my acknowledgement, and my gratitude go out to you. You do have credibility in this society, and your well deserved vindication is coming.

      Hey Everyone!  The Band Banquet Kicked!  It was lots of fun! The dinner was really good.  I had Chicken, and it had this really good sauce on it, but i wasnt sure what it was. (It kinda looked like BBQ sauce lol) Even the rolls and the salad was really good.  The best part of the meal was the desert!  CHEESECAKE!!!! muhahahahaha, it was so good.  I was in a way happy that the band directors didnt talk as much, but I kinda wished that the classes would have given them their presents.  All well, anyways....... The DJ was really good, I was suprised.  Usually DJ's are really bad, and they play crappy rap songs, but this guy played a little of everything, including some of my favorites. The dancing was lots of fun.  I was kinda glad i went single cause i got to dance with katie anyways. :)  It went by really quick, i couldnt believe that i was there for like 6 hours.  I guess its like what they always say.... "Time flys when your having fun."  Well that is all for now, please show me your opinions by commenting.  Lata  Peace! (he he Tim)

      Blah!!!  Im so freakin sick of school! Mrs. Ryno is probably the worst teacher out there! BELIEVE ME!  Today I took a test from her and it was IMPOSSIBLE! She doesn't even really teach us the stuff, she just goes over it. She doesnt even give us notes! A couple of weeks ago she made me take a quiz even though i was absent the class before, and i had no clue how to do the stuff on the quiz!  I got a 44 on it! I will probably get like a 70 this six weeks and its basically her fault! HOW CAN SHE TEACH ALGEBRA WHEN SHE CAN'T EVEN MULTIPLY 2*2*2!!!!!!!!!!!  Alright enough about me rambling and whining about how much mrs. Ryno sucks as a teacher.    Anyways, on friday, we had this really cool Dragon Fest day! We got the whole 2nd half of the day off!  And the really cool thing about it is i won this giant dragon by entering a raffle that was only 1 dollar a ticket! Hes so cool!  Hes such a chick magnet! ;)   That is all for now, i will post more tomorrow, gtg finish doin hmwk  Lata!  ~Eric

      Well.......This post is basically just saying what the title says....So its worthless.  Anywho......I leave for Montana Tomorrow.....I won't be back for 4 weeks!  I guess i am excited....It's just that fact that I am growing older i guess.....cause I don't get as excited as I used to...  Montana used to be the only thing that would save me from the real world........ But now a days.....Now that I am 15, It just isn't the same anymore.... Everyone is busy up their.....   It used to be so much fun......But now it gets kinda boring...... I don't have any of my video games(except my GBA SP), and i don't have a computer..... I have T.v. but that gets boring after a While.... And the whole time I am up their, I usually am working, trying to help my grandparents do Yardwork!  Don't get me wrong...I like to help my grandparents, now that they are getting older and can't do as much, but seriously...... It gets frustrating after a while.  I guess the Moral of this Post is that i am growing up more........ AND IT SUCKS!!!! Is anyone else going through the same thing that I am?!?  Oh BTW, I get lonely too, because everyone is working, including my brother and cousin..  Even here in TX, everyone is always busy....  I wish I could just talk to someone who actually cared.    I wish I could have someone who would always be around and hang out with me.....  I wish .....I had a girlfriend....  Sigh.........................................................

      I go to montana in ............ 10 days! HOooray! (June 27th) wahoo, Montana is a lot of fun.  I love going up there and escaping from the heat and sitting on my grandparents deck, just relaxin and readin a book.  Ahhhhhh its so nice.    Well........ Not much is new (like always, i know i know, i am boring)  anyways....... My friend Daniel E. got me hooked on this really cool Anime From Japan called "Naruto."  Its so cool!  I first watched this awesome music video that combined clips from the anime, with the song My immortal by Evanescence (great song)..Any ways.... I thought the music video was outstanding!  it was so cool.  The Anime clips and the song lined up perfectly, creating a really cool effect!  After watching the Music video, i was intrigued to watch the anime, and so i went to...... http://www.narutocentral.com/index.php?id=fullepisodes_rm.html  I have only downloaded the first one so far b/c my internet is screwy, but i loved it!!!! Its probably one of the coolest animes i have seen!  I strongly suggest going and downloading it (its free!)  You won't be sad that you did.  I would also suggest going here........  http://www.narutocentral.com/index.php?id=amv_mbbp01.html  ...... and downloading Gaara's terror.  (THats the music video i was talking about!)    Well, my fingers are getting tired, lol, so thats all i am posting for now  Later  Eric

       Drive    Sometimes, I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear And I can't help but ask myself how much I'll let the fear Take the wheel and steer It's driven me before And it seems to have a vague, aunting mass appeal But lately I am beginning to find that I Should be the one behind the wheel Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there With open arms and open eyes So if I decide to waiver my chance to be one of the hive  Will I choose water over wine and hold my own and drive?  It's driven me before And it seems to be the way that everyone else gets around But lately I'm beginning to find that When I drive myself my light is found So whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there With open arms and open eyes Would you kill the Queen to crush the hive? Would you choose water over wine Hold the wheel and drive?  ~I Love this Song~  Eric

      yay i fixed my blog again! Rock On!!!  Anyways............ So yea..................... There is nothing new except for Marching Band Camp UGH!!!  : (  We go from 7 in the morning to 12 noon.  Then take a break untill 6, and go from 6 to 9 It sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Im so freaking tired!!!!!!!!  I hate marching band camp......................it pays off i guess once we start going to the games.   The main reason i hate it is the fact that it screws with my social life........I was supposed to go to the Village with Alexa, Alex, and Linz, but No!!!!!!!!!!! I had band camp so i couldn't go!  It made me mad.   Thats all for now!  Peace out!  (oh and P.S. Tubas are better than saxes *cough, derek, cough..........sneez*)  Eric
