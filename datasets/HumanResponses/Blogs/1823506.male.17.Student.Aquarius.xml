      I was living on some kind of military base. One night I snuck out, spend most of the night in the closed entertainment tent. However it was full of people, and there was a live show going on -- a lot of very good looking girls putting on a musical. I don't think it was a real musical though, one of the songs they performed was "Love Shack".   After that, I decided to play some sort of  prank on a commanding officer. I was very nearly caught, and the entire base was put on alert. People were marching everywhere looking for the intruder, searchlights were sweeping all over the place; it was very tense.  I moved like a ninja, clinging to ledges, wall jumping, sneaking like nobody's business, and finally made it back to my tent, and went to sleep.   The next morning colonel Cathart (yah, the one from Catch-22), called me into his office. They hadn't seen me on the base during the alert, and knew I wasn't in bed. He had no proof that I caused all the ruckus, but he strongly suspected it. Instead of reprimanded me though, he shook my hand and gave me a plum tomato. He said that this kind of intense alert was very good for his men. He told me they performed admirably, and that this will be a real feather in his cap.

      Don't remember a lot about this one. Only that I was playing a lot of arcade games, and shopping at Future Shop. The people I was playing with were my friends, but I didn't recognize any of them. More than one were apparently exchange students living with me. At one point I was driving in a car, a little drunk. I was pulled over. I hit my door lock with a hammer to try and open it, and wound up with a really bad bleeding nose. Went into Mcdonald's to get cleaned up...

       I had just got off the plane in Germany. However the place I was at seemed like a combination of Germany and something like Brazil. It was very corrupt, and people were buying black market police badges so they could clear customs more quickly. I was walking from the airport (presumably to my new house), and we passed several schools. A normal public school, a private school, and a "School for Canadians". This one was on the edge of a beautiful lake, in some sort of Canadians only embassy. Lots of barbed wire.

      I've decided that I am going to start recording all I can remember about my dreams. A few rules:   Remember that anything here is a dream, and I have no control of my dreams Know that I will only record exactly what I can remember of my dreams, these logs may be broken and confusing, but I won't make up any filler, and I won't leave anything I can remember out. All comments I have on the dreams will be put in italics to set them apart from the dream log itself. I can only record a dream immediately after I wake up. If I'm not near a computer when I dream, I can post later only if I wrote the dream down. This way time won't dull the dream or alter it in any way.    That said, as you can see this site is not really ready yet. I plan to make major formatting changes later on. Bear with me.

      This one started out with me walking home from school. Its a very long walk from my school to my house, and I was getting very tired. Somewhere along the way I saw a bus, and decided to catch it. I rode for a long time on the roof of the bus with my shirt off, enjoying the breeze and the sun, until someone told me to get off. When I got off the bus, there were five people I knew playing around. I only remember that one of them was Aaron Gray. Next thing I knew, we were all armed; four of them were wearing armour and carrying both a long and short sword, while myself and the other 3 were wearing leather armour. I carried a bow and a longsword, plus a wood katana on my back that I made. We ran through the forest, Steel armour vs Leathers. Our group was faster as we weren't weighed down, and decided to take our stand at the top of the hill. We got there easily, and had plenty of time to rest before the others showed up.  I fought Aaron. In the practice round I beat him easily. But in the real fight his sword turned him invisible. We fought for a long time even though I couldn't see him, but in the end we both scored on each other.  Then I was throwing together a giant party, somehow involving little cherries. It was going to be a great show.

      I don't ever remember having this many dreams about an event before it happens...       I caught a plane over to Germany. Than back home because I forgot one of my shirts, than back to Germany again. I was staying in a hotel with a lot of other people I know. Megan and Stephanie from Rotary, Sarah B, Nick, and a few others I can't remember. Everyone in Germany spoke English, and I was frustrated because I couldn't practice my German. There was a Best Buy down there, and I did some serious camera shopping. I also remember waterslides of some sort.

      Can't remember a lot about last night, but two things stick out. One, I let Steph Brown do my hair, and it looked pretty good. Two, I met George Bush, shook his hand, than took him out with a flying tackle. I think I was beating him down for a long time. There were a lot of people around, but nobody really cared.

   urlLink Katie , taken at  her BBQ last night.
    
 Yesterday marked my last official day of school for fourteen months. I had a chemistry final from 8:15-9:15 in the morning which went very well indeed. After that I was finished with school, but I had no other plans until 5:00. So I stayed in the chemistry room talking to Mrs P, and reading her chemistry textbooks. Its odd ,I have a hard time convincing myself to do homework  or to study for tests during school, but I'll gladly spend hours reading textbooks that aren't required for a course. 
 Kate's barbecue was a blast. At its peak there were probably thirty people there, a table full of food (meat, chips, peanut butter cookies... viva puffs), and a stack of CD's a foot high. Several people were tossed into the pool, and hundreds of pictures were taken by several cameras.  
 All goes well I plan to spend today cleaning my room. A clean room is a good way to start the summer. Besides, the weather isn't exactly inviting me outside.

  Jeff, recently graduated. Its not a stellar photo, but if people understood how difficult it is to get a picture of this guy...
    
 Another day, another entry. I don't have a lot to write about, except general feelings of success in my math final and biology provincial. Only thing left now is my chemistry final, then no more official education for 14 months. Neat. 
 I would like to throw a link up to my friend Katie's photoblog. She leaves for Montreal in a few days to work in the tourist industry all summer. She is extremely prolific in her posting, and some of her pictures are really quite good. She posts at fairly low resolution, but you can get the idea, and I'm sure if someone wanted a full-rez copy they could e-mail her. I'm actually very glad she has taken an active interest in photoblogging. When I hit Germany I am going to rely on her posts to keep me in touch with Victoria life.  urlLink Her Site  
 Also check out  urlLink WordPhoto.org . Brilliant idea for a site, anyone hunting for inspiration or an excuse to practice photography should find it worthwhile. I know I'm going to aim to get a photo a day on there.

  Sarah J, a friend of mine. Taken in Psychology class today.
    
 The last few days of school annoy me. Monday and Tuesday are the last official days, but attendance is extremely sporadic - people would much rather study for exams or play in the sun then sit in classes. Besides, the teachers have all but given up teaching, classes consist of movies, maybe a pretest or two. 
 Classes are completely done as of this afternoon. Exams, however, start tomorrow. So until Friday people still have to drop by to study/write tests. I have a math final tomorrow morning, a Biology Provincial tomorrow afternoon, and a chemistry final on Thursday. Thus there is no clear definition of when school actually ends, things just kinda fizzle out. I know its a minor issue, but it does bug me a bit. When one invests ten months in school, one deserves a sense of finality. Oh well.

  A couple of days ago I saw these boots hanging off a mirror in an old, bronze VW Bug. 
    
  Today started off my week very nicely. After school I took a friend of mine out for ice cream. We sat at a picnic table near the water and studied chemistry in the sun. After she left, I got some food, then went to Emily's youth group to take part in a photo scavenger hunt. I got to meet some very interesting people; we roamed around Sidney looking for 24 listed shots such as hanging upside down, convincing old folks to dance disco, or winning a hug from a gas station attendant. Give me a day or two to get organized, and I'll post the pictures we got. 
 Tomorrow promises to be equally lazy. Exams on Wed and Thursday, and then I'm free!

   Myself, taken about 10 minutes ago.
     Well there. After a morning spent wading through CSS and HTML, I have pulled together an acceptable site (I think). I have very little experience with web design, so I don't care if its not perfect, I'm pretty proud of myself. Even made the title image all by myself, cutting letters out of a 1997 issue of Ultra Game Players magazine. My eyes hurt, and I need exercise, so I am going outside to cut the grass.

  Another attempt at blogging starts here. I hope to use this blog in conjunction with  urlLink this one . My main goal in these blogs is to fiddle with templates and learn some html. In addition, I hope to use this blog to improve my photography skills, and my other one to work on writing. Finally, I plan to make both of these blogs available for my friends and family to keep tabs on me when I go to Germany. 
  Posting on both may be slow at first, but I'll work on it.

  Little tribute to Katie, and the others not around this summer. *Smile*
    
 Photographing fireworks really is as tricky as I was told. I probably took a hundred shots of the fireworks, at all sorts of shutter speed and aperture settings, and only a handful turned out acceptably. Great learning experience though. 
 Canada Day in Victoria is always an interesting experience. I caught the bus into town; we were stopped about halfway there by Saanich Police. Four of them boarded the bus, checking everyone's bags for alcohol. If you had any, and couldn't prove you were over 19, they dumped it. I pulled out my camera to take a couple of pictures, but a cop yelled at me. He told me if I didn't put the camera down immediately, he would smash it then and there. I don't really think he has the authority to do so, but I didn't want to take the risks. If anyone knows what the laws are regarding public photography in Canada, especially in this instance, please let me know. That cop was livid... 
 Victoria PD had called in about sixty additional members (including mom) plus all the reservists for Canada Day. They blocked off a large area around the inner harbor, inside this region they have special rights to search anyone. No alcohol was allowed in, and over the course of the night they filled dumpsters with freshly emptied bottles and cans. Still, that never stops people from drinking, and there were a fair number of drunkards on scene. Jack, Stephanie and I walked around until it started to get really busy, then we walked down to Fisherman's Wharf for the fireworks. Jack was right, it was the perfect place for the show; only light crowds, a huge moon, and a perfectly clear view. 
 I planned to take a walk up Bear Hill today with my camera and tripod, but the whether is icky. So today I decompress, maybe play some Super Nintendo, and get some reading done.

  I saw this shot while fixing a broken spring on one of the theatre chairs. Its not very well balanced, but I happen to like it a lot. Grainy too...
    
 
 Post is awfully late, I have no good excuse as I spent the day watching Star Trek TNG. 
 These last few days have been pretty busy. Kai's back in Germany, as is Mirji, Katie left Tuesday for Montreal. I haven't had a lot of free time yet to notice their absences though, I spent Tuesday night at Claire's house, and worked from 6:00am-7:15pm yesterday. I took several pretty neat photos of work (at the  urlLink Star Cinema ) on my break, I'll post another at the end here.  
 The Space Channel is having a Canada Day TNG Marathon, I slept in this morning then spent the rest of the day cleaning and watching Star Trek, very pleasant. I catch a bus in half an hour to Victoria for friends and fireworks, let's see if I can't get a couple of pictures out of the night. I have no idea how to photograph fireworks, so it may be a decent learning process. 
  I still have to watch  urlLink Beijing Bicycle ,  urlLink The Royal Tenenbaums , and  urlLink Our man Flint  before they are due back on Sunday. I am aiming to watch 60 movies this summer, not necessarily a movie a day, but on average. I would appreciate any film suggestions, e-mail ramsus@gmail.com.

  Jack snapped off this photo of Katie and I at 3:00am this morning.
    
 I managed to get Katie, Jack, Bob, Zoe, and Emily over last night to watch a bunch of movies.  urlLink Tank Girl  turned out to be absolutely wonderful, as was a little German film called  urlLink Enlightnement Guarenteed.  The best part of the night had to be after most people left. Katie, Jack and I went for a 1:00am walk up Bear Hill, to look out over the valley and talk for awhile. Very peaceful, and comfortable. With Katie leaving for Quebec tomorrow I was especially glad for another chance to see her. Also made some tentative camping plans with Jack, which I really look foreword to. 
 I spent most of today helping out with the NDP for the federal election. It was very satisfying to help pull the vote, calling people and reminding everyone to drag themselves down to vote. Then spending a couple of hours with some of the other volunteers watching the results come in was more interesting than a lot of hockey games I've seen. I wish the NDP had earned a couple more seats, and the Tories a few less, but overall it doesn't look like a bad government. Its kinda neat that with the liberals and NDP totaling 134 seats, the one independent MP will have a lot of power in issues that Polarize the liberals/NDP and the Tories/BQ. Should be fun to watch this new government work itself out. 
 Oh, check out  urlLink Student Vote.  Hehe, Saanich/ Gulf Islands went Green... Kelly is going to kill me.

  There is something highly satisfying about convincing Andy to spray himself in the face with a hose...
    
 Last couple of days have been busy and wonderful. Friday involved a great party at Ashley's, and Saturday morning yielded homemade waffles, leftover wine, and a great beach walk with Ashley, her boyfriend, and Kevin. Saturday afternoon brought a BBQ at Emily's house. Only four other people showed up, but we still had a great time, creating "modern art" (throwing lawn furniture into the pool) and fighting over the hose (until Hayley snapped the head right off it). 
 I've been shooting hundreds of pictures, though only keeping my best few shots from each roll. With practice, I think my technique is beginning to improve. I'm getting the hang of aperture and shutter priority, and playing with focus and exposure metering. Still, I would really like to take a class in photography this summer, if I can find one in Victoria.

  Not a very meaningful shot, but I did plant these today!
    
 I planted trees today. Woo-hoo. It was actually kind of nice, except for spreading the manure. It looks pretty scraggly now, but who knows, maybe I'll come home next summer to a... less scraggly hedge. 
 I'm getting a little antsy for some sort of adventure. I want to roam somewhere at night again, with a couple of friends, or go Camping or something. If anyone is interested in going camping somewhere for a couple nights let me know. We can go to Saltspring, or up island a little ways.

   Saw this on the (8th?) floor of a parkade on Yates Street
    
 I was reading  urlLink this blog entry  on photoshop, and to what degree is Photoshop acceptable to photographers. I have some opinions on the matter, but didn't want to add them to the end of an old, long thread, so I thought I'd say them here 
 There should only be two kinds of photoshop use. Photographs are still photographs, no matter how much photoshopping was done to them, if Photoshop is only used to change the way a camera views the scene. This includes changes like cropping, resizing, filters, contrast etc. In this kind of Photoshopping the scene itself remains unchanged. Some of these changes may not be possible in a "wet" darkroom with regular film, but they are the kind of changes that could be brought about as a combination of different camera/film/lens/aperture etc. settings and different "wet" darkroom techniques. I think that this kind of photoshopping is fully appropriate and should not be criticized in any way. This includes the controversial "lomoize" action. The scene being photographed remains unchanged, it just looks like you used a different kind of camera. There is no shame in this. 
 The other kind of photoshopped work is an Image. Images may once have been photographs, but Photoshop has been employed to change the scene being photographed. This includes techniques such as Airbrushing, Clone stamp, and use of things like Copy/paste. Drastic things like an image of George Bush spanking Saddam are certainly no longer photographs, so are less obvious, like tweaking a model to make her look younger. There is nothing wrong with using Photoshop to create these images, but nobody should assume you are trying to capture a real scene. A photoshopped image is more like a painting than a photograph, great in its own right, but should not be passed off for a photo! 
   urlLink  This photo has been photoshopped to soften it and add that diffuse glow.  I still consider this photo "real" (not to mention beautiful). In contrast, look at all the pictures on  urlLink Greg's Digital Archive  You can rollover each image to see the original photograph. In these images, Greg used Photoshop to change the subject of the picture. His finished products are astounding, but they are in no means an accurate representation of the scene. Ideal for ads, or as art, but in no way photographs any more. 
 This is just my opinion on the subject. Please add comments, I would love to hear what other people think about use of photoshop. On a similar note, take a look at  urlLink this . Apparently I've violated many, many of Adobe's grammar laws in this little rant on Photoshopping... er... the use of Adobe® Photoshop® software to enhance pictures. 


  I stumbled on  urlLink A Softer World  today, think I found it from Photoblogs.org. Couldn't stop laughing for an hour. Intriguing photos turned into a kind of three frame comic strip, with sharp, sarcastic narrationon and haiku-like simplicity. Makes my top 25 sites on the web without a doubt.  
 Currently  very pleased with Future Shop:  ...They replaced my Cannon S1 IS with a brand new one with no fuss, even though it was out of the 2 week exchange warrenty and should have been sent away for three weeks for repair. Thanks again Jaz!

  I'm in love with this shot. Took it at a felt hat stand in the Chinatown market, held every Sunday here in Victoria.
    
 I had an excellent day yesterday. Zoe and I had made plans to meet up in Fan Tan Alley at 1:00. My bus dropped me off in Victoria early (12:30), so I had some time to kill. I bought $4 worth of lychee nuts and ate most of them in the alley. For some reason I was great tourist fodder that day - no less than 20 people took my picture. Zoe was a little late, but I didn't really  notice, I was having a pretty good time. 
 Zoe and I were pretty busy, we walked through Folk Fest, she bought a discman, and we spent quite awhile talking movies at Lyle's Place. Great weather, great company. After awhile, when we ran out of things to do, she came back here. We watched  urlLink Citizen Kane  and  urlLink Mars Attacks , and cooked up a blindingly easy dinner.  
 citizen Kane comes highly recommended. I had always planned to watch it, but more because its a classic and one should see these things, than out of any real desire. After finishing it, I think it definitely deserves its spot as one of the best movies of all time. Its gripping, and brilliantly shot. 
 Now I'm off to Future Shop. The Zoom button on my camera has become stuck, and I need it repaired. Wish me luck.

 The lead singer of General Rudie, an excellent ska band all the way from Montreal.
 

 
 Its been a few days since my last post, apparently Blogger has decided to make a few changes in their interface. I like the additional built-in features, but I'm much happier with the simple html interface that it once was. I'll stick with the "Edit HTML" tab. 
 Quiet week for the most part, not a lot of pictures, or a lot of super memorable events. However, Ska Fest officially started up Wednesday, and runs until 2:00am Sunday morning. I went to the show Friday night in Centennial Square with Jack, Dave et. al. Open air shows rock my socks; you can breathe cool air, and enjoy the sun setting behind the stage. Four groups were supposed to perform, but one got stuck at the border. To make up for it, General Rudie played a much longer set. We all had a great time, and I woke up this morning so sore from the skanking. The big show is on Saturday night, at the curling club from 6:00-2:00am. 
 Speaking of shows, Little Shop of Horrors is playing down at the Mary Winspear center next Saturday evening. I am going for sure, if anyone else can possibly make it I would love to see people. Zoe was crucial with the set development, and has put in way more hours than anyone should spend working on it. Its going to be one hell of a show!

  Claire's dad, an incredibly smart and interesting man. He can always be counted on for a great talk.
    
 I had one hell of a night on Sunday, really excellent. Zoe and I went over to Claire's house for dinner, then down to the Star to watch Spiderman 2. I had already seen it, but I think that made the film even better, as I could focus more on the humor in it. We got out of the film at 11:30 or so, then set out for a beach 
 Sunday night was exceptionally clear, so we spent most of it outside. I don't know when the last time I saw so many shooting stars was, the three of us sprawled out on a couple of blankets with some strawberry daiquiris, watched the stars and talked until morning. Mark and Matt came by at one point, Mark and Claire cancelled each other out and we didn't hear much from their corner, but Matt brought in some great new conversation.  
 Both Zoe and I had to be up early the next morning, so the three of us eventually retired to Claire's floor. I got a few short but comefy hours of sleep than caught a ride into work with Claire's mom. All in all a highly satisfying evening. 
 Aside from a good morning at work, yesterday was pretty quiet. I'm playing through Final Fantasy VI again, and thoroughly enjoying it. I plan to give blood today, and maybe make it to shoot some zombies in Area 51. Time to go, Fillmore is on!

  Jack, dressed to the nines for the show on Friday. He lost the button for his jacket shortly thereafter.
    
  Friday night I went to a show at the Fernwood Community Center with Jack and some other friends. The show was supposed to start at 6:30, but none of the groups playing brought microphones so we went for a little walk while they got their act together. We found a little shop that sells $2 tacos, still haven't tested them out but it looks promising and if anyone wants to join me for tacos let me know. 
 Lythic Blue was great, and the other groups decent too, but the highlight of the show had to be the Hoochie Girls. They did a spectacular ska cover of "Girlfriend in a Coma" by The Smiths. I think it was the first Smiths song I ever heard, and is still one of my favorites. Hearing the Hoochie Girls play it so well made my day - maybe even my week! I'm officially looking foreword to ska fest very much indeed. 
 Bob and I made it out to see Supersize me down at the Star yesterday. Anyone who has ever eaten at McDonald's, or ever will eat at McDonald's should not take another bite before watching this show. I've been off McDonald's for a long time, though I would still occasionally indulge in the nuggets. After that show I won't even touch them any more. Supersize me is clever, and far from dull. Its a documentary, but it moves quickly and is full of humor, no matter how morbid or twisted. I would watch it again.

  As I've said, I haven't been out taking many pictures recently. This was the view from the #70 bus heading down lochside yesterday afternoon.
    
 I've watched a killer number of movies since Sunday, most in the company of very good friends. If any of those good friends are reading this, get a hold of me, I want to get a gang together for blackberry picking (and eating). 
 My dad was supposed to pick me up after work last night, but he wound up working late. He also forgot about picking me up until he got to his car after work. As a result, I was stranded at the Star until 3:00am. It was eerie, but pretty comfortable., with only the office lights for illumination, and a bowl of stale popcorn for a midnight snack. Still, I could have used the sleep.

  Another one from the archives. While I was planting trees a few weeks back, my dad was laying some drainage pipe.
    
 There are good suppresses, there are bad suppresses, and there are the kind of surprises that leave one hyperventelating, week kneed, and super nauseous. I'm not sure whether this evening's surprise was good or bad, but I can tell you it will be days before I can fully untangle my twisted tummy. 
 On a lighter note, Yesterday night was fabulous. Tomorrow night also promises fabulous..ness (fabulosity?). Oh, and imitation crab rox my sox.

   I haven't really taken many pictures these last few days. This is one from the archives, a long, long time ago.
    
 I haven't slept for more than an hour or so since Saturday morning, thanks to Ska fest and work. Zoe came over today for pizza and Jackie Brown. She couldn't stay to finish it, but I have the DVD all week, hopefully she'll be back. 
 Bob showed up about halfway through the movie. He has been working a lot this summer; night shifts at the McDonalds, and I don't get to see him as often as I'd like. We grabbed midnight pasta (cheesecake for me) at QV bakery, than came back here to watch late night TV. Captain Star, Trailer Park Boys, Curb Your enthusiasm, even Speed Racer. I don't regret the lack of sleep, however I think I'll try and get some now.

  Saw him crashed on the bus, thought it was worth the picture.
    
  My wisdom teeth came out on Thursday. All of them. Consequentially I've been a little swollen and sore. Hasn't really stopped me from having a good time, just from eating solid food. 
 Getting knocked out has got to be one of the stranger experiences I've had. The office where I had the surgery had a great view, and was staffed by two very funny doctors. Before I knew it there was a needle in my arm, connected to a tube, connected to a syringe full of clear liquid. He drew some blood up, which reminded me of that scene in  urlLink Pulp Fiction  where Travolta shot heroin, then pumped it in. I had little sensors connected to me, machines beep at me, and a funny tingling in my fingers. The doctor asked me if I had a boat, then I woke up in a completely different office, robbed of my teeth, and very disoriented. It was all quite fun. 
 I spent a couple of days looking like The Godfather, but I think the swelling is starting to go down. W007. 
 I can't sleep with all the swelling, but its okay because Jack and Claire payed me a visit. We ate pudding and watched  urlLink True Romance ,  urlLink Bottle Rocket , and  urlLink Dune . I sort of drifted off just after an episode of ReBoot, and had a very cool ReBoot dream/delusion. 
 I'm off to Vancouver tomorrow, with Jack and Zoe, to see the Andy Warhol exhibit. We have more time than that to kill, so if anyone can recommend good, inexpensive things to do in Vancouver, please let me know. I'm very excited.

  CLaire, deep in some blackberry bushes ripe for the picking.
    
 Monday was a good day indeed. Zoe and Claire arrived here around 1:00. After Fillmore we went out to pick blackberries on Bear Hill. Its still a little early in the season, but once we got high enough up the hill we found plenty of berries. We also found Zoe's grandmother. Her family used to own a lot of the property around here, there are still several members living up the hill. Her grandma had the same idea as we did, and took Zoe's cousin out picking. There were plenty of berries for all, and it was neat to run into people we (read: Zoe) knew. 
 We came back with too many blackberries to eat in a day. Once Jack arrived we made spaghetti, then when Bob got here we blended up some blackberry milkshakes. Yum yum yum. We went upstairs to watch Casablanca, followed by Strange Brew. We made Bavarian cream with current and blackberry sauce, watched some of the Democratic National Convention, and generally goofed off. I was a little sick from all the food, Zoe more than a little so, but it was more than worth it.

  No photos at all today, I left my camera at Claire's house.
    
 So I made it out to see Little Shop of Horrors live at the Mary Winspear center, with Claire, and Nicole. The show was incredible, with great acting, and a beau series of Audry II puppets. Unfortunately it just can't seem to draw in the crowds; there were probably 100 people in the theatre, 1/3 its capacity. If anyone has a chance to see it this summer, please do! 
 After the show I wound up back at Claires with Zoe, Claire, and her dad, sitting around a little fire cooking stakes and talking for a few hours before falling asleep on the porch. I didn't get a very good sleep, instead spent most of the time reading  urlLink Infinity Welcomes careful Drivers . Hopefully tonight, with the exception of Captain Star, will bring a decent nap.  
 I spent most of today in Victoria. Zoe and I walked around, took in the Chinese market, and shopped for music and DVDs. Then we took in  urlLink "Before Sunset" , at the Odeon (really neat film, it has super long camera takes, and, in an hour and a half, covers exactly an hour and a half of the character's life.). We met up with Claire and mark for Japanese food, then the four of us played a few really sad games of pool -- turns out we are all pitiful pool players. Finally, I wound up waiting at Sayward for an hour, reading my book and waiting for the bus home. 
 Tomorrow promises blackberries, and Casablanca!

  Zoe sitting on some stairs leading up to a White Spot. Don't know where the real entrance is, but its obviously not here.
    
 Ah, back from Vancouver and, after a good night's sleep and a shower I'm ready to post on it. I only have fifteen minutes before I have to head off for work, so I'll make it snappy. 
 Zoe, Jack and I caught the first ferry into Vancouver on Sunday morning. We checked in to the Cambie hostel by about 10:00, then hunted around for a breakfast joint. I was still pretty swollen, and couldn't eat, but it didn't really matter. Over the next few days we crisscrossed Vancouver many times. We saw the open air market at Chinatown, the Pride Parade (I got lots of pictures that I'm sure Kelly would be jealous of), the Warhol exhibit, and a tonne of other things. Played frisbee and debot in Stanley Park, and walked the Granville market. I didn't sleep much, in favor of spending the nights in the hostel's common room meeting other travelers and exchanging stories. 
 The hostel was superb, the company irreplaceable, and of the 300 or so photos I too, at least half of them are well worth keeping. I'm posting some now, and I'll doubtless throw up several more of them when I need filler pictures. 
 I realize the post is a little rambly, but we did way too much for me to coherently organize. The point is that the trip was great. Oh, and the swelling is mostly down now, hopefully the pain will only last a few more days. Time to work.

 Beat Peasant's Quest today all by myself. Pretty satisfying ending. Spent last night with Jack and friends. Working tomorrow. Packing my closet tonight, or at least as much as I can get done. Quiet day, but these things needed to happen. Have lots of boxes to fill. Should have written in complete sentences, but a little tired.

  Jack, dealing a hand of rummy for us on the ferries.
    
 Played Doom III with Bob yesterday from 2:00 until dark. At one point I noticed strange twinkling lights coming from the bottom of his blinds. Turns out it was the sun. We had no idea what time it was. 
 We eventually moved to FF: Crystal Chronicles. As far as dungeon crawling goes, its very satisfying. Plus, playing it with a friend adds new levels of teamwork (not to mention item hoarding and insults). There were several standoffs over who has to carry the manna bucket, but he cracked eventually. The multiplayer aspect is what makes the game, I wouldn't even think of playing it alone. Unfortunately, we just assumed that the "diary entries" that frequently occurred was the game saving itself. Nope. So we have to repeat a few hours later on.  
 I've been playing a lot of Fallout II at night. Had a Fallout dream yesterday that rocked. Today it looks like squash (the racquet game), Empire Records, and 24 Hour Party People 
 Oh, may I point any fans of mind-numbingly awesome webcomics over to  urlLink VG Cats . Its Canadian, and it gave me a cramp from laughing the last time I read the archives.  urlLink Here  is an example.
