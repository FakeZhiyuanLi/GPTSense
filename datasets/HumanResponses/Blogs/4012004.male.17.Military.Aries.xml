       I seem to have lost interest in my blog very fast...&nbsp;&nbsp; anywho!   worked today.&nbsp; yay physical labour...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   and now a story about the jazz festival, and a glimps into eric's mind, and desires.....&nbsp; beware, lol   at the jazz festival, i saw a girl selling t shirts, and i said "lets go see how much they are" so we went over, and i asked, and the girl smiled at me, and said 5 bucks...&nbsp; then realising i meant the shirts, and not the flashing lights, she smiled again and said 20...&nbsp; at this point i was in a trance...&nbsp; she had 1 of those smiles tht i have only ever seen on 1 person befor then, and it mezmorized me... anyway, in my trance, i went for my wallet, and realised i only had 15.&nbsp; &nbsp;and i forgot to haggle, as i was in my trance....   there are many things that can be attractive to guys, about girls... but when it comes to me: boobs? asses? HEEEEEEELL NO!, i go for the smiles! :)&nbsp;&nbsp;  so smile at me!, if i start acting dumb, u have a great smile!&nbsp;   bed time

       Last night, my uncle phoned me, and asked me if i wanted to go fishing with him today. And of course i said yes!. lol..&nbsp;&nbsp; fishing is great fun!,&nbsp;&nbsp; so i packed my lunch last night, and went to bed, and got 3 and a half houtrs sleep, then got up at 4:30, got dressed/washed and ate, and my uncle picked me up at 5:00 AM.&nbsp; We then drove to Gravenhurst, and spent the entire day in my uncles boat, fishing.&nbsp;&nbsp; we caught nothing that we could keep..&nbsp; ie: 5 inch rock-bass, perch, and small-mouth-bass.&nbsp; we almost caught a small-mouth-bass that we could have kept, but he got away...&nbsp; curses......&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so we came home, empty handed, and red from the sun!..&nbsp; it was a good day!&nbsp; i got home at 8:30, and after a day on the lake, i'm exhausted. lobster man now says "Ta ta!"

       Heyhey!&nbsp;&nbsp; I was supposed to go to the beaches jazz festival with the Chlebowskis yesterday, but Mike had too much homework from summer school, and Dave didn't want to go without Mike.&nbsp; Mike told me that I could still go down to the festival with his parents, but that would have been kinda wierd, as i dont know them that well. So I ended up not going.&nbsp;Then at 6:00 ish, I was talking to Veronica on MSN, and she told me that Justin Han wanted to go down, so the 3 of us went. V drove to the subway, and we took the subway to Queens station, and a Red Rattler (street car) to the festival. We then walked around for 3 hours at the festival..&nbsp;&nbsp; saw many interesting things, including women that looked like men, men that looked like women, and a rock band that was trying to be a jazz band (they were horrible).&nbsp;  Instead of taking the Rattler back to the subway, we walked; and an hour and a half later (or more.. not sure) we got to the subway station at Queens, and got back to Finch at about 1:30 AM, and I got home at 2:15 AM.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All in all, it was a fun time!   Today, Farzana came over, casue she needed my help with building a catapult for her grade 12 physics class in summer school... it had to be able to launch a marshmellow 6 meters, and after 2 hours of work, we had built it, and were able to lob the marshmellow about 9 metters, or more.&nbsp; It was fun :).   This evening, I went to Port Parry to sub in in a&nbsp;dixieland jazz band, I was playing trombone, sight reading all the music... and i made $21.00&nbsp; :)
