       By the way, the name of this Blog, "Solid Mud Wannabe," um, ya.  I'm not sure how long it is going to take for me to get  Solid Mud  published.  So, I'll go ahead and put in a little exerpt to hold you over and give you an idea of what will be coming soon.  Enjoy:    AUTUMN IN ALASKA     Super Turtle, Eddie, Double O, and I drove to the edge of Anchorage where the sun rotated around the sky and shone behind us.  The sun lit the Chugach Mountains in a perfect, cloudless way.  Being late October, most of the leaves had fallen out of their trees by then.  Snow was clinging to ground further and further down the mountainside each day the autumn progressed towards winter.  The dead oranges were amazing. The fresh white of the descending termination dust was telltale of coming winter.   Further down the Seward Highway, looking out the window of the back seat, I could see that Cook Inlet’s tide was coming in at full force.     “Just checking up on you,” I said quietly to the tide.   We took a break from the road at Beluga Point, that miniature headland, that enormously meaningful set of rocks that had endeared themselves so much in so many ways to my three friends and myself.  The four of us climbed the rock formations up above the mud flats below.   A sign read: Dangerous water and mud flats.   Naturally, we got down as close to the rushing water as we could!  I'll never get over the way the white water tide roller-coasters its way up and down as if gravity falls asleep once in awhile.  It’s almost as if the inlet, that hidden part of the Pacific Ocean, chooses to behave like the Colorado River while Mommy’s back is turned.  Just amazing!   We had fun with the pockets of mud that had been trapped on the rocks above the water line after the last tide had gone down.  At first touch, the surface was solid, dry and clumpy, but when shaken up, it turned into slimy and gritty custard.  (The kind you would never serve your children on New Years Eve.)  We stood firmly on top and initiated earthquakes with shaking feet.  Our feet were then firmly embraced in a distinctively sticky surface tension which covered the soupy-flavored mud underneath.  When I tried to lift my feet free from the ‘solid mud grip’, I felt dislocation knocking at the joints of my knees.  A moment later: POP! my shoes came out clean…leaving behind only tread formations.   That littoral mud is comprised of salt water, dead animals, and volcanic ash.  Salt water doesn't freeze at the same temperature as fresh water does and it was below freezing for the rest of the world.  Our hands quickly became numb playing with the hard slime, but we simply couldn’t resist the solid mud.   We moved on down the road bound for Girdwood but didn’t get far.  We stopped 200 feet down the highway, got out of the car again, and walked up to a new trail that had been opened up above the Inlet.  The trail occupied land that the old Seward Highway used to claim.   Facing the Turnagain Arm of the Cook Inlet atop an oceanfront cliff, we commented once again on the forcefulness of the incoming tide that was coming back to reclaim the mud it left behind six hours earlier.  The mud flats on the other side of the New Seward Highway slowly disappeared under the twelve-hour high tide with a liveliness we likened to a toddler’s meddlesome ambition.    “The tide is like a little kid; gets into everything,” I told everyone.   We left the new trail, returned to Eddie’s truck, and finally found Girdwood, AlAskA.  In accordance with reverent tradition, we all found a bottle of our special soda and an ice cream snack of some fashion or another.  We stood outside a store just a stone’s throw away from the highway.   “You know guys, we’re lucky to see AlAskA like this.”   “There’s no telling what it will look like in fifty years.”   “Imagine, when our grandparents were born, the land we’re standing on now was Russia.”   “All that construction, the dynamite, the flaggers in the construction zones.  It all happens so fast.”   “Ya, but those flaggers are cute.”   “Hard to be mad at traffic delays when it’s a beautiful girl waving at you.”   “True, but still, it’s too fast.  That’s what I think.”   “Keep AlAskA like it was.”   “Here here!”   “Cheers, guys.”   After enjoying our rituals at Girdwood, we drove to a mountain access road at the edge of Anchorage.  We drove up to the parking lot below Flat Top Mountain and played in freshly fallen snow.  It was cold on the mountain, but the early sunset we were lucky enough to enjoy made every inch of frost bitten skin worth it.    The sky above us was clear, but when the sun hit the stratosphere-level clouds on the horizon, light was cast in the entire yellow-red spectrum all about us.  It was impossible to imagine that the power of our sky could not travel the world over.  We stood high above everyone in Anchorage, watching the sun set over the city’s populous.  We were satisfied to live without them that night.

      The Post Office closes here at 4:30 and there is no 24 hour PO in town.   That's one thing I miss about Anchorage.  The 24 hour post office was hoppin' at all hours.  I went there once at 2 a.m. and they were having a party!    Tonight I'm going to watch "Killer Clowns From Outerspace."  Tomorrow I am going to watch the new "Texas Chainsaw Massacre."    Panama City is going insane...a guy down here drove around town running over as many people as he could.  Then he ran over a cop.  It's unfortunate that the average time spent in prison for murder in the USA is 7 years.  Another pointless fact of the day:    Roy Allen and Frank Wright started A&W root beer to honor the returning solgiers from WW1.  They set up their first root beer stand in Lodi, California (like the CCR song "Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again."

        In the early part of the week, Monday and Tuesday, I was at the hospital on and off both days...all day.  I have been medically cleared of all probable heart conditions!!!! Clean bill of health, baby!  My heart has been officially diagnosed as having "Excellent Tolorence."  That is outstanding news and I have been soooooo relieved, that I have been hitting the gym VERY hard with my only friend in Florida, Tim-Timmy.    Every single muscle group in my body is sore or depleted.  I just got back from the gym tonight.  We worked out our back using a variety of 7 excersises.  I must have told Tim I hated him at least a dozen times.  The hardest was in the racquet ball court where we crawled back and forth without our legs, another few times back and forth with our legs (bear crawls), and then we did one of those Army Training excersises where you stand, jump down, throw your legs out behind you, jump them back, stand up, recover and repeat.  We did that thirty times at the very end of the day and I hated Tim Timmy.  Now, I'm super tired.  My hands are killing me from these last several days of working out...we have hit EVERY major muscle group in 3 days.   On Monday we're starting a grueling six week program, the likes of which I have never taken part.  I'll be eating 4 eggs every morning, two large sweet potatos a day, a can of spinich a day, 8 ounces of cottage cheese a day, two cups of oatmeal a day, a turkey breast sandwhich on wheat bread (mustard is the only allowed condement), a chicken breast sanwhich on white bread (aslo only mustard), several vitimins, 64 - 96 oz of water a day, and as much natural juice as we can choke down.  This will be for six weeks.  Plus, durring the work outs we'll be drinking these foul (but all natural) muscle recovery shakes.  We'll be mixing every excersise known to man, 2 hours a day for 6 days a week.  Sunday will be our day of rest.  We chose Sunday so we could relax and watch football.  But we still have to stick to the diet.   What are the benifits you ask?  Well, Tim Timmy has done this three times before, once per year.  And it's time once again for the yearly killer.  The literature he gave me says that since this my first time on the program, that if I stick to the work out, don't cheat, and don't miss more than three days in the six weeks, I'll add 2 inches to my arms, three to six inches on my chest, 40 pounds to my max bench press weight, shave 3 inches off my waist.  Oh ya, also, once a week, we have to do one 45 minute aerobic session.  The other three will be 20 - 30 minutes.   I guess what I started telling you, is that all this week, I've been at the gym, or on the track all afternoon and into the night...and this shall continue for the next six weeks starting on November 1st.  The up-side is that I'll be able to take ONE full week off at the end.   Double O is trying, as I type, to get onto this thing.  We're getting closer at least.  Mungo Halloween Eve

      If you just think of stalkers as fans then you can act like a movie star! Yeah, do that and life is good.  So, I just went around the house setting all the clocks back an hour. Now I am way too tired for it to only be 2030! Man, I am going to be waking up early tomorrow.  Speaking of early...I was up early this morning to wash the trailer and get it cleaned up for the trip. I even washed the roof. Man, it was dusty as hell from sitting at Nellis in the dirt. We leave two vents on the roof open to let the heat out and all that dust got inside as well. Luckily Beck cleaned the inside while I was doing the outside. Glad it's done and it looks good.  I went to lift up the bed (lifts like a hood on a car with storage under it) and found the frame all cracked and messed up. The bed wasn't usable! When we had it in the shop to fix some stuff this past Thur they must have messed it up. Bastards. I called them and told them about leaving on Tue for a trip. They told me to bring it in on Mon and they would put it at the front of the line to get fixed. I thought that was nice of them since they are the ones the messed the damn thing up in the first place. Well, I got to looking at the damage and thought to myself, "I could fix it my damn self and save me the grief of taking it across town!" Went to Home Depot and bought some wood, screws and brackets. Got home and took the bed apart and put it all back together again. Beck helped a bit so it only took about an hour or so and $7. Good for me and it is stonger than it was originally!  So, is 007 going to get on here? Is Mungo going to post...he is always full of strange musings.  See Ya ST

      Mungo and Eddie showed up and we had a good conversation. Mugo has a stalker. Good for him. It is nice to have fans.  I had a crazy girlfriend once. Name was Hedi. Nutty girl. Ended up yelling at her on the phone at 3am to stop calling me...just ask 007 since he was my roomie at the time. It all ended with her showing up to my door the day before she PCS'd wearing only a trench coat and lacy, see through undies. She had a bottle of wine with her as well. As she was standing in the hall way of my dorm she opened her trench coat and flashed me while saying, "Let's have sex one last time before I go!"  I slammed the door in her face. Even after all that she still emailed me from Greece wanting to get together and crap. Finally, when I told her that I got married she stopped emailing.  So you see, fans are good and fun! Neat stories later!  Good night.  ST

      Here I am on Thursday night at 9 central and 007 has said he can't make it this week because he is going out. That's cool, I don't blame him at all. So, now I am sitting here online and neither of the other two yahoos have gotten online (no pun intended with the yahoo thing).  Maybe I will just sit here and chill out alone...all alone. I may even cry a little.  I just bought two of those walkie talkie jobbies that have a range of up to 5 miles. I have used the 2 mile ones plenty of times but since I will be heading to Disneyland next week I wanted some that were a little smaller and more powerful than my old ones. The thing with the 5 miles ones is that a person is supposed to get a FCC license and a "station" name to use the long range channels. There are 7 regular "no license" channles and the other 15 channels are the 5 milers. I wonder if I will be arrested for using the long range ones with no license? Hmm.....  Hope I don't meet Bubba face to face or have to sell the house to pay the fines! Ouch.

      I hope you all had a great Thanksgiving. We did. Details are boring but just know that it was a great time.  Our trip to Salt Lake was a fun time and brought back memories of AK. We watched the AK and Mountain Biking DVD's when we got home. Okay, so we watched the highlights.  My keyboard is telling me that it is tired of me hitting it so I must go and let it rest now.

      So Mike and I got back from Salt Lake City area last night at around 2300. We went there on a whim on Friday morning and came back the next night for no apparent reason. So, I got to do a ROAD TRIP one more time with a bro before I leave.  We almost left Turkey day night, but decided we would get there too late so left around 0530 the next morning. It was fun, but at the same time a fiasco.   We did have one thing that I wanted to do and we actually did it, Look at appartments. I found some nice ones around the base and I will have to make a decision of how I will want to live. Plenty of money or a nice place.  Of course this adventure to look at appartments came at the expense of missing a 5 year olds B-Day party. Totally not our fault though. And we did stop by beforehand and wished her a happy B-Day.  Overall... Good ROAD TRIP. we had Jones Energy Drink. It tasted slightly different than the other energy drinks only because every energy drink tastes the same with a slight difference in each. We tested a few on this trip and Monster was the winner for taste and pep. Sorry bro's, Jones can't hold a candle to this one. Besides, it is not like Jones Soda in flavor or smoothness.

      I recorded FIVE whole songs today.  They are as follows:  "Landslide" "My New Song When It's 35.5 Degrees Outside" "Messing Up and Rambling Drunk" "Autumn" "Autumn II"  --Autumn is a girl I chat with on line.  I recorded those two songs singing the words we typed in the chat room with each other.  Those songs are really stupid and really funny for me.  That's all I had to say for now.

      I have, yes, I have a big job ahead of me.  It is cleaning my apartment.  I have been drawing up design schematics and other associated outlines on what form this cleaning will take.  Will it be "clean as I wander" (slowest, easiest)?  Will it be "centalized cleaning" (single tidal wave pushing everything into one place)?  Will it be "group and sort" (very tedious)?  Who knows, but something must be done, and with me on the computer, I am conserned that I am wasting valuable time.  It is 2 p.m. on Saturday.  I do not have to work again until 10 p.m. on Monday.  This ought to give me plenty of time right?  Sure.  I've been off of work for 2.5 days already and I still haven't done a lick.   I had a conversation about notebooks with Hillary.  It was three or four days ago.  I told her I bought 5 stripety notebooks for my new book, "Highway 9."  Sounds reasonable, right?  Now, you'll will all have to forgive her for the question she asked, she doesn't know me as well as ya'll do.  You would never ask me this question.  She asked, "Erik, what happens if you run out of matching stripety notebooks?"  AH!  I freaked.  I covered my head in a blanket and excused myself from the phone for a minute.  I had to hide.  Today I went back to the store in hopes they had more notebooks of the same kind.  They did!  Relief.  I bought 5 more.  Do any of you think I'll need more than 10 notebooks?  Two hundred pages each.  Times 10 = 2,000 pages.  I should be okay now.  My friend, Timmy, just left for San Antonio.  We ate at Waffle House before he left.  Our waitress had bubba teeth.

Tonight I talked to my friend, Chris Klatt, for the first time in five months or so.  He has been moving around a lot lately.  It made me happy to talk at him again after so long.  9 months and 5 days until I am free.  No Alarms, Mungo   Song of the day:  The Magnetic Fields "The Dreaming Moon"  (songs of the day come from the songs I end up hearing several times on the day I enter my Blog.  Simple as that.  I include them in hopes someone out there is building a CD of these wonderful songs to listen to in order to remind them on the Blogger Days....Blogger days being more blogger than others.)

I switch between that one and a Dallas Stars hat (use to be MN Northstars) I am going to get a cool Cowboys hat when I go to Korea... Actually I will be getting quite a few dif team hats of prior mentioning in Korea with a leather jacket to go with each.  I don't know if I have to pay child support on the 1st or not yet. Depends on when the judge puts his Herbie Hancock on the papers and what he determines.   No biggy either way, Just ready for it to be final.

      The San Diego Chargers lick MY ass.  Speaking of ole SD, Shawndra called me from there to fill me on this stupid additional duty we share at work.  She's on vacation so I'm doing it now.  I'm jealous of her.  I wish I was there.  I can't wait to leave Florida for the last time in my life.  When I leave at the end of next summer, I have every intention of never returning for a single minute of my life.  Florida licks my ass.  Hokay, I'm going to read until 4 a.m.  That gives me four hours before I go to sleep.  But first, I have to take my garbage out.  It smells like the summer of 1997.

      I wrote a new song last night, it's called  The Mancala Song  for now.  I recorded it before I went to couch, played along on my untuned guitar without practicing the chords or the melody of the lyrics before I started.  I might work on it again, fine tune, re-do, enhance, quicken, condense, and master the song at another time...but I have a feeling no future attempts will sound any better than the impromtu first recording.  I've been taking a lot of poloroid pictures of myself.  I'm gaining quite a little stack!  The Colorado River is the bomb, son! She don't need no rest!  What you thinkin?  Hokay, so, I'm going to get back to the task at hand.  That is rearranging my apartment.  Well, I call it rearranging.  Other people might call it cleaning...but when MUNGO makes a mess, it looks like a decor!  Time to rearrange the decor.

      We packed up the Focus and pointed it down the road. The road took us to the little city of Laughin, NV. The Colorado river was still flowing there after all these years as well. I wonder if it ever gets tired and needs to rest?  We ate lunch and a Buffet and said Hi to Beck's parents. It was time to tell the Focus to take us home. "Home Focus! Home!"  We are home now. Good Focus.  The wind is blowing and it is cold. Nice night for a fire in Las Vegas town.   ST rolling up the carpet and going inside.

      Today was a wonderful wonderful day in the world of Mungo.  So simple.  First, I bought some old man clothes.  Courdoroy pants, a green sweater, and one of those "Old Irish Guys' Hats."  Then, Tim and I took a couch out to the edge of a bay and left it there.  We will return later to sit there by the water and take pictures of us sitting there.  It will be the perfect place to take Hillary when she gets here.  On an even more interesting note, I turn 9,000 days old on December 15th, 2003.

      Yes, I am still alive and living in LV. Just got back from a friends that ST thinks I am having a "relationship" with. Not the case. It was my 1st shirt from when I was TDY for NOBLE EAGLE.   Besides that, not much going on, just the typical ST and Eddie hangin out... which would cause most people to worry anyway. I have not even pissed Beck off yet, even with the vulgar language and racial slurs that occasionally pop out of my mouth.  It is kick ass hanging with the bro though.   I bought this Atari thing for the TV today. It was about $19 and it is so kick ass. It has ten games on it from the original atari and is all in the joystick (which is actually like the old atari joysticks.) Ahh... the good old days... now I need to find one for the Intelevision. There was an old cops and robbers game that I always used to play that I miss.  Oh, If I were a caveman, I would be dead right now and mike would have died 5 years ago and Mungo is fixin to die. I think double O would be dead too, because I think he is 25, but he is never on this site so it doesnt fucking matter.  Well, Thats all I have to say about that.  Dueces,  Eddie

      Flew from Vegas to Billings, MT. Talk about crappy town. Well, that is the impression that I got for the whole 30 min I was there. I took a cab got the little Ford Focus and hit the damn road.  Car was REALLY dirty! I mean bad dirty! Oh well. I cleaned the windows so I could see out of them and took off.  My adventure was supposed to take me right through the heart of Yellowstone National Park but unfortunately that didn't happen. I took the turn off for Yellerstone and drove 52 miles down a road only to find that the park was closed! They are letting the snow pack build up on the road for winter use! U-turn and another 52 miles back to the main highway! CRAP! Then I had to take the round about way and when all was said and done that detour added about 2 hours or more to my trip. Oh well, it was still fun.  I stopped in Provo, UT (near Salt Lake) and stayed with Aimee (Beck's niece) for the night. I got back on the road early the next morning and was home by 1300 (that includes getting the car washed).  Almost 1200 miles in less that 24 hours solo. That includes the sleep stop. It was a fun trip and the little Focus and I got to bond a little. I did miss Beck and Ashlee though.  Eddie and I may end up driving to L.A. to go to Knotts Berry Farm for a day. We shall see how things work out. The admission is free for Military so it would be a shame to waste that!  Talk to you fools later.  ST-out

      I worked yesterday and did an overnight last night. Just got home and I am now off the rest of the week. Nice.  Edwardo should be rolling in sometime tonight. Hopefully the weather isn't bad and his drive is easy.  Loving the pics that Mungo Slade made up with the Jedi stuff. Very funny.

      I just finished my custody agreement paperwork and sent it to my paralegal. Yes, I broke down and hired someone because the shit was too hard to figure out between me and miranda. Too much law bullshit.  I can handle street laws, but not divorce laws. too much wierd shit.  Anyway, the paralegal cost me $400 and then I have a $118 filing fee and then another $40 fee for me not being there when the gavel drops.   So why is divorce so expensive you ask???? i will answer that as my last line before the peace out stuff.  The good news is that i talked to a lawyer and since it is uncontested, he refferred me to the paralegal which HE said would charge less than he could. I was amazed... a lawyer not trying to fuck me up the ass.   I want to eat some sushi. I will have sushi when I go to vegas wether ST knows he is coming with me or not.  I am excited to leave but at the same time bummed to all hell. I went to go get pics with Lorelei today, but that was not happening. She was cranky as hell and not wanting to cooperate. Could have something to do with the fact that we had to sit in the studio for a fucking hour because they were running "a little behind". Fuckers. Ah well, trying again tommorow.  Because its worth it!!!!  Peace my brothers  Eddie

      Dude, I edited out your phone number. Do you really want to post it where anyone can see it? If you do then feel free to post it again.  The number I posted on here for me was just from an 80's song. 867-5309  I emailed everyone my real cell phone number.  Just looking out for Mungo Slade and his posse.

      I just got back from the gym.  My left arm dropped on the third excersise, long before my right arm would have given in.  Tim suggested pitching southpaw more often.  Do any of you remember Kevin Swaidek?  He's coming to Tyndall in April.  I'm his sponcer.  I got a new phone!  Well, the phone is an old one.  I bought an old lady's BIG NUMBER phone in AK and never used it.  I got a home line and chose my old lady phone (out of the three working phones I have) to plug into the wall.  It works.  To reach your mouth into my old lady, dail these numbers:   1-850-###-####  ... that ought to do it.  I'll get a hair cut on January 8th.  I'm gonna shave it bald...and then I'm not cutting the top again for years!  And years!  I'll keep the sides in regs until August 04.  We're going hippie, baby!  Mike, if you ate a jar of Vascilline...and then pooped it out, I'm guessing your butt would be ready for a lot of big men.   Song of the day:  The Postal Service "Random Song"

      Today was a postilicious kind of day. Everyone was posting up a storm (with the exeption of one). Maybe that "one" doesn't really like us! Maybe they are postaphobic? Hmmm...some deep issues here.  About the Mud. Yes, I only want to work on it in spare time and that is why I think that maybe once a month is a good update interval until we see how it goes. Sound good?  The other blog can be used for ideas and stuff just so we are on the same page and aren't trying to send emails to each other.  I have the tickets to Montana and will be off on Sat and returning on Sun. Fun fun. If you want feel free to call me during my trip to say hi. My new cell number is (702) 867-5309. Okay, fine, the number is in the email that I sent everyone earlier today. Of course my phone will be turned off on the airplane since the FAA can get a little uptight about those kinds of things.

      So, dang.  Today.  Was a good day.  I ran and missioned and councelled.   So here's some stuff. -I showered and put on a tee-shirt...realizing I had forgotten to dry my back. -My hair is at my eyebrows. -I left my toothbrush at work on accident.  I'd like to brushemmateeth, but I don't want to get dressed and drive to work, use my master key to get in, find my toothbrush in the dark, and have to drive all the way back with all that extra weight in my pockets. -I bought a book recently, "The Seven Pillars of Wisdom" by T.E. Lawrence.  I can't wait to read it.  Shoot, putting it off has already been a lot of fun, actually reading is sure to be something special. -Madison just skipped first grade.  In spring, she might skip to third grade...that would put her to start fourth grade when the kids she was in kindy garden start second grade.  She can beat her mommy at chess. -I bought some chocolate mints from a girl scout.  I ate them all.  Quickly. -You want me to write a poem?  You got it! -You walk in slow motion/and burn in your fire/when your path of devotion/is a path of desire -I am proud of reaching my short term goal:  Running the 1.5 mile in 11:45 -My long term goal:  Running the 1.5 mile fast enough to melt my sneakers -I smell something.  And it's so bad I might clean it up.   Song of the day:  Grandaddy, "AM 180"  (You've heard it if you've seen "28 Days Later.")   Peace and Plastic Forks, Mungo

      2.....1,2,3,4!  I'm kind of an idiot.  I went to that link, downloaded something, and after installing it and running it...just a square blank white window opened up and sorta just sat there.  Now, like I just said, I'm kind of an idiot.  So I don't know if that means it's running properly or if it's not running at all.  "Spybot Search and Destroy" is the dealyo I got.  I think.

      Just a heads up. I sent an email about this awhile back but I thought that I would put a reminder here. Spybot is a program that searches your computer and detects all kinds of spyware and tracking software that is put on your system WITHOUT you knowing it. I have been running it for months now and I LOVE it. It is on all four of our computers.   Mungo will be on here soon to sing the praises of Spybot since I just sent him the link to download it. He was having all kinds of problems with spyware. PLEASE at least try it! It really does help a TON!   urlLink Spybot   ST-out (of my mind)

So, I am driving to Vegas as soon as I final out and say bye to my daughter if all goes well. That will put me in Vegas around 8 pm. Screw stoping in Salt Lake area. Just stopping there for gas. I will be there plenty in the upcomming years anyway.   WOO HOO!!!!! I am almost competely done with MHAFB!!!   As for getting windows shit on... How does that happen?? they almost have to be aiming to hit them. I could understand slanted windows or something like that. but we are talking about projection from ass with a slant angle...

      Here is the sure fire way to get rain and bird shit in less than 24 hours! Yes, washing your car is a good way but it may not get you both rain AND bird shit and it may not happen within 24 hours. Okay, okay, here it is.  Go to Home Depot and spend $50 on window washing stuff for your house. Next, borrow the biggest frigging extention ladder your neighbor has (about 50lbs). Then spend about 3-4 hours going around your house and washing every window by yourself and making them so clean you can't tell that glass is even there.  Yep, that is the perfect way to have a bird shit on the highest, hardest to clean window you have and then to have it rain all over the damn things!  This is my life.  ST-out

      Say hey to Ney for me, would ya?  Sorry to hear that you won't be leaving when you expected.  If I were you, I'd just quit.  MUNGO ANSWERS QUESTIONS! I don't think I'll be making a hard back.  The paper back will be out two months after I send everything to the publishers.  The CD?  They're all on my living room table.  Only three people have theirs so far.  I've been lazy addressing stuff.  ST dosn't have them yet, no.  The latest haps with Hillary:  I talked to her on the phone for 4 hrs last night.  We talked about damn near everything, like we always do.  She's coming to Florida 18DEC03.  Can't wait for that.  Bubbles, how's the Buddah?  I took my friend Jeremy to the airport this morning.  He's headed out to war on this very Vetran's Day.  Fitting, huh?  I didn't like seeing him off like that.    What else?  "It's over, it's over, it's oooooooover!  I know it's over."

      Well, it started off an OK day until I got told that I could not leave until the 24th of this month. Which really fucking sucks. At the very least I am going to try to leave on the preceding Friday so I can have some fucking time off.   But the good news of this (kind of) my shop NCOIC (yes the position I held) said that I could just take that week off if I do have to stay... no leave... just free time off.  Not a whole lot of other stuff going on, just ready to leave this hell hole.  Mungo, when does the hardback come out and where the hell are our CD compilations that you were going to send? or does ST already have those? What is the latest haps with Hillary  Bubbles, SHIT dude, write something.  ST, sorry bro, but this place hates me and I have mutual feelings about it too.  Oh, by the way, there was no mention of sexual harrassment from the party. This is a good thing.  Later Bro's

Well, I guess I shouldn't say much about Edwardo since all his shizo is on the way to big K and all he has is a laptop with no internet. Bubbles says that he just can't think of anything to say but he reads this everyday. Hmmmm....since when do you have to think of stuff to say? I just babble. Sort of like a shared diary (queer way to put it).  It is already kind of cool to look back and read a couple of the posts from the start. Gives insight to how things are going on a regular basis with all of us.  Okay, enough fag talk.  ST......OUT!

      This Blog entry has nothing to do with decoys.  I just thought that's be a fun thing to type in bold.  I have finally narrowed down the 1,000s of pictures I have taken in the last several years to one of Beluga Point.  I have made some enlargements, two of them, and I will give them to an Ausie named Daryll Foster to paint some stuff over top of the photo.  The end result will be the cover for  Solid Mud .  Very exciting.  Thank you, Mr. Turtle, for the good luck wishes with the new one.  And good luck to you on your solo Focus trip.  May the weather be void of freezing rain and snow!  The New One:  I dabbed at a little warm brain something and came up some very good pages.  Last winter (and part of spring) I wrote a preliminary 251 pages (or so) and I am working off of those in five brand new notebooks.  They are numbered:  1, 2, 3, 4, & 5.  Easy peasy, yep 'n teasy.  I started writing last January when 1,000,000 things were on my mind.  Many of them worries about the desert.  ST advised me that a night-time trip to the beach may be theriputic...and it sure was.  That's where the book starts, on the Gulf of Mexico, sitting on the beach, writing the begining of my new book.  Thanks for the advice, Mike.  I liked it.  FUNNY:  I heard a guy say to a girl, "I am an artist.  I paint people's chests with titty twisters."

      This weekend (15Nov) I am flying up to Billings, MT to get Beck's new company car for her. I will be flying up on Sat morning getting the car and driving home. I will stop Sat night in Provo, UT and finish up the last 6 hours of driving on Sun.  I am excited about a solo road trippy. Good thinking time. Also, we are going to sell the Maxima ASAP. Selling the car will save us about $600 a month in payments, insurance and gas...not to mention any maint. Her company pays for EVERYTHING. Nice. It is a white Ford Focus.  Let's all hope the weather is good and the car is in good shape so it doesn't break down.  ST-out

      I re-begin work on my second book today.  For now it's called  Highway 9 , but who knows if I'll keep that one.   I'm still debating on how I want to write it...either a straight forward story of what actually happened, or tell it from the point of view my "Warm Brain" felt it when the events origonally took place.  If I choose the latter, it will be like recreating some things that weren't ever there.  Imagination doesn't exist, and my imagination took the truth to some pretty weird places back in those days.  1997 - 1998...the winter months were slush.  Slush on the road.  Slush in my head.  Wish me luck, ya'll. Mungo

      Hey Ya'll.  This is MUNGO!  Drinking wine!  I've had two sips so far.  I'm wasted.  I just got back from the Florida Ironman Triathalon.  I handed out water, gatorade, gatorade bars, coke, bananas, grapes, apples, oranges, and chicken broth.  It was a blast.  Shawndra was there.  She made fun of me everytime I got near her, so I stopped going near her.  Now I've had three sips of wine.  Totally blottowed.  I talked to Hillary for three more hours last night.  What else?  OH.  The pictures of Double O... classically hillarious.  I'll save those pictures forever.  Nicely done, Mike.  Double O:  I DOUBLE DAWG DARE you to go into NAC looking like that!  Mungo

      I'm so happy!  Double O and Hillary met for some beers and they really hit it off.  It feels good for me to have that second opinion.  But then again, Double O loves everyone...having that heart three sizes too large and all.  But, I'm pretty sure it would be the same story if Mike or Eddie had met up with Hillary.  She's coming here to visit me from 18Dec - 22Dec...then she goes to the Virgin Islands to visit her brother for Christmas (I decided not to go)...and then she's coming back for 10 more days.  29Dec - 7Jan.  I'm very excited.  But, as Eddie can attest to, there's not dick to do here in Panama City.  I just hope we don't get bored.  A good thing about her trip is that I will only have to take three days of leave to cover the 15 she's here.  That's very nice.  Working on an AETC base has it's privilages.

      Hey Bubbles. Remember to "publish" your blog when you are done so it updates the read page. Otherwise they won't get published until I publish it. Glad to see you on here.   Solid Mud   What would be the interest in trying to start up a www.solidmud.com site. Kind of like what Mungo used to email out but instead it would be a website. I can buy solidmud.com for 2 years and it will only cost about $20 total.  Do you guys think we could come up with some content that would be interesting. Maybe people could send in stories or some funny pics that they have taken. I don't know why that popped into my head but it did and I thought that I would throw the idea out there and see what you all think.   The main hurdle would be finding content to keep the site somewhat fresh. Another idea is that since we all live in different parts of the US of A that we could look up some funny news articles or events and post those or summaries of them. We could make the Solid Mud sort of like a news paper format or a news letter format that gets updated every week or two weeks (two would be a bit easier at first).  Let me know what you guys think. Mungo especially since I don't want you do feel like I am stealing your idea. I just think it would be easier to put out keep up if maybe we all work together on it.  Links to funny websites that we like or find is another idea.  Chime in.  ST out.

      I feel like a rubber band! I just got back from doing a trial push-up, sit-up and 1.5 mile run. I suck. Enough said.  Yes, Disney was a GREAT time! WOW! We timed it just right. There weren't very many people at the park and the weather was absolutely perfect. The Tue was a little smokey but by Wed the sky was clear and all the smoke blew into Vegas! HA! It rained just a bit which really helped with all the fires going on in CA. Speaking of fires...on the way down we saw heliochoppters dropping water on the fire close to the highway! Cool stuff. The fires were so close to the highway that the other direction was shut down...that is close.  While at Disney and the day at the beach we took lots of pictures so the website will be updated soon.  Okay, I hope all is well. I have to get going. I have to sort through the 200 pictures we took! Oh yeah, my damn garage door is broken so I have to try and fix that as well. Owning a home does have it's down side...REPAIRS are YOUR problem!  See ya.

      So I am sitting here at 2:08 AM and trying to get my shit together for the "Big Move" and realizing that there is probably too much to do without enough time to do it. My laptop is open and running while I am on my desktop as well. I am installing stuff that I need on my LT while trying to get the bogey dope from my desktop, and figured it was a good time for a solid mud entry.  Disney Land Rocked. It was awesome to hang with Mike for a week. I think that was the coolest thing about it. Who better to hang with then one of the bro's.  Anyway, same old stuff going on here and I got a lot of work to get done  PEACE!!

      My New Year has now gone by about 13 hours ago. It was a fun new year and now I have 4 days to kill before I have to go back to work.  I think there were people taking pictures last night so if I get any good ones I will send them to you.  Today will be a hermit day more than likely. I don't really want to leave the confines of my room other than to smoke. I do have to mop the stairs though since I am on bay orderly so I will get to that eventually. I also have to make sure that the place is not trashed.  I did not get a phone call from ST this morning... and for that I think I am almost thankful. However my Grandma called and talked to me for a few minutes but she could tell that I was not all there so that was quick.    Should auld acquaintance be forgot, And never brought to mind?    urlLink http://www.tamoshanter.free-online.co.uk/Auldls.htm   I never did understand that fucking song but this explains it.

      Happy 2004 Eddie. How is it there? I will try and call you Jan 1, 0800-0900 Big K time. By my clock it is Jan 1, 2004, 0022 right now.   Too bad that Hillary got delayed. Better safe than sorry.  I hope the Broncos make it to the Bowl. That would be cool. Too bad the Cowboys didn't make it. Sorry dude.  Our trip home might be interesting. There are two routes...Utah or AZ. Both are predicting lots of snow. Crap. Oh well. My parents are leaving soon to go home. Sad ST.  For our New Years here in CO we are not doing much of anything. Beck's parents get the local channels for the east coast so we are probably going to watch the ball drop in NY live then hit the sack here at 1030 or so. Maybe we will get crazy and stay up until midnight when the New Year washes over us like a tide from the east.  Hope you have a great new year and I will be chatting at you guys soon. If anyone talks to 007 tell the crack head hey from me.  See ya,  ST

      So, guess what?  I got to the airport in Orlando (364 miles away from home) and went to the Itallian Eatery they have set up there in the food court.  I ordered and ate baked ziti and a slice of carrot cake.  Then I busted out my notebooks and started writing sentances for Highway 9, my follow-up thriller to Solid Mud.  I only wrote five sentaces when I heard:  "Paging Erik Kershner, Paging Erik Kershner.  Please pick up a Page Phone and dial zero for a message.  Paging Erik Kershner...."    So I wandered around until I found one of the so-called "Page Phones."  I picked it up and dialed "0"...as instructed.  Nothing happened.    "What a load of pucky!" I said.    There was still an hour until Hillary's flight was supposed to land, but I thought maybe she made an earlier one...you know, things change, right?  So I went down to baggage claim to scout her out.  No Hillary.  Hmmm.    Then I heard, "Paging Erik Kershner, paging Erik Kershner...."  ALL OVER AGAIN!    "SHEESH!" I exclaimed.    So I found a different Page Phone and dialed "0" once again.  But this time:  HARK!  A ringing... and a connection to an operator.  We chatted and she asked, "Do you know a young lady named Hillary?"    "I sure do, Ma'am!" I said.    "She left you a message," she paused, "she left a number for you to call her, do you have anything to write with?"    So and so and so and so, I called the number and a dude answered the phone, "¡Hola! Cangrejo Shack de Ben y lecciones que practican surf, discurso de Ben."    I was stunned.  "Hello, Senor," I said (thought that was a nice touch!)  "My name is Erik Kershner.  Hillary Seeland left a message to call this number."    "Oh, hey, Erik, this is her brother."  (weird wild stuff!)    "Oh, hey Ben."    "I'm guessing you haven't talked to Hillary yet."    "No, I haven't.  What's up?"    "So you don't know anything yet, do you?"    "No....."   "There was a plane crash on St. Thomas.  All flights out were cancelled.  Hillary will be flying out tomorrow.  She'll be taking a bus from Orlando to Panama City and will arrive there on the 1st at 6a.m."    "Holy cow!"    So I folded myself up, got back into my car, boggied on out of Orlando and on home.  Made good time too.  So...that was my adventure.  How was your night, yall?  Peace and Love, Erik  PS...did I catch that right?  Did Eddie say something about Mind, Body, and Spirit?  That was good stuff, bro.

      No Porn, Pork or Alcohol... that is what I (Mungo as well) lived with while in the desert. However. the only thing that was hard to get a hold of was alcohol. and even at that... if you knew Brits, you were in there.  My boys are out of the playoffs so Denver would be the one that I want to win. Fuck the Titans. (I am sure you can figure that out)  That is too funny... killing a pig... he he he... guess that settles the pork issue... ask the owners of the dogs if they are having ham on New Years... he he he.  As far as the porn.... who cares, he is not hurting anyone but his own fragile little mind. Even at that, the boy needs something in his life since he will probably be 30 before he gets some. (no offense)  I miss the thunder storms in H-town. They were always good.  Anyway... it is almost time for the new year and once again I will have no resolutions. They are fucking worthless and if you need a reason to quit or start something other than self-fulfillment it is not fucking worth it. No, I am not meaning that in a selfish way, I consider charity things to be self fulfillment... goes along with the mind, body, spirit thing.  later peeps

      I have a lot to talk about, so I'll get to it.   NFL:   Yes, I watched The Green Bay Packers kill the Denver Broncos.  Because Denver lost, that kept Minnesota out of the play offs.  Well, the cardinals beat the Vikings with no time left on the clock, so the cardinals kept the Vikings out of the play offs.  Well, the Vikings lost 7 of their last 10 games...maybe the VIKINGS kept the VIKINGS out of the playoffs.  My Superbowl prediction is this:  New England will win every game, including the big one, by more than 10 points.  I think they'll do it easily.  Now, that's the NFC side of the house.  AFC is a different matter.  My first choice of the AFC teams left to go to the super bowl is Tennessee Titans.  They got the salt to make it.  However, they're sort of flaky.  The second strongest team, and lately, the most consistent team is the Denver Broncos.  Last week doesn't really count though, as ST said, a lot of the second stringers were playing.  Jarious Jackson was in for Jake Plummer...and then J.J. was replaced by some other QB that sucked just as much.  Griffen took the load from Clinton Portis and did sensational, but then again...as Beck knows, the Broncos have always had a very strong back field.  Shannon Sharp was also out, and that sent a lot more passes to the first string tight end (one of the only 1st stringer stars that played) Ed McCaffrey.  Wait a minute.  I'm a Chargers fan...I'm not supposed to know anything about the Broncos...let alone pick them to reach the super bowl...  But they're only my 2nd AFC choice.  I think they'll have to beat the Titans to do it, and that might prove challenging.  Okay.  Next subject.   Pigs:   When I was talking to Hillary and she heard the first of the screams, she freaked out.  Bad.  I didn't know what was happening.  She just sounded suddenly afraid and was making little eeping sounds.  I got a sick feeling in my stomach when I asked, "What's wrong, Hillary?"  and she said, "They're killing him..." in a very weak scared voice.  When I realized it was a pig I was very relieved.  Girls...they know how to scare ya, don't they?   Porn:   I would just keep it to yourself.  Didn't you look at that garbage when you were 15?  Maybe not on the internet, but surely, you peeped it when ever you had a chance.  I didn't, but I have sheltered myself from a lot in life, not just porn.   Storms:   Storms a-brewin' in Colorado, huh?  Check it out check it out check it out check it out--Today was a beautiful day.  No clouds in the sky, a very light breeze, 73 degrees.  Just perfect, you know?  While I was on the phone with my mother tonight, I began to hear a strange noise outside.  I didn't really pay it no mind...and then I went out side.  DOWNPOUR, baby!!  Water water everywhere!  I couldn't believe it.  I had only been indoors for 30 minutes.  When I had gone inside it was dark, but that's because it's night time.  That's what happens at nighttime.  I did not expect a monsoon!  Nope nope nope nope nope!  And then the thunder and lightning came.  I was on top of the world.  Warm rain, warm wind, bright flashes of lightning, and thunder that sounded like a bag of drums being dropped from 20,000 ft.  Amazing.  It was all lovely.  I caught the news and they said that tomorrow it will be right back to where it was earlier today and will remain so for at least the next five days.  And that is lovely news...and it carries me into my next topic.   Road Trips:   Tomorrow, at approx 1300, I will leave Callaway, FL and make my way to Orlando, FL for the third time in the last two weeks.  It's a long drive, yas yes, yas, but-  it's worth it.  Hillary is coming back to me and that is marvelous.  She said we were going to have Christmas together...and then later that day, we'd have New Years.  She said it kinda sexy like-- and that's all I'm going to say about that.    (Okay, I'll be really embarrassed if she reads this, somehow.)  So, you didn't hear it from me....ya, that ought to cover me.  Okay, I'm done now. Peace and Love, Mungo   Song of the day:  R.E.M. - "Country Feedback" (live from ROAD MOVIE)

      Life is good. I am sick of almost passing out from just climbing the stairs! At 9,500 feet it doesn't take much to make me exhausted, literally. Everytime I walk up the stairs I just about fall over. I have been told that it can take a month to get used to it.   Our Denver trip was a lot of fun. I got to see Mile High stadium and Coors Field. We also went to the Broncos training fields but no one was home exept the players cars. The players were getting their asses handed to them by the Packers in Green Bay. That's okay though since we are already in the playoffs. Almost no first string players were on the field because they need to be healthy for the playoff game against the Colts (we beat the Colts last time we played them).  Today we just cruised around CO Springs and looked in some shops and crap like that. Mellow day. I don't know what is on tap for tomorrow but I am sure that I will enjoy it.  We may pack up and come home a day or two early due to storms that are supposed to move in and dump snow in a few of the cities that we pass through on the way home. I will keep you updated.

      My little 15 year old brother obviously does not know about the history function in Internet Explorer. I have checked out the history for the past week since we have been using my laptop for internet access. I found links to more porn sites than I can count.  Well, at least it isn't gay porn.....  Should I make fun of him? Nah. That could scar him and he might start looking at gay porn!

      You guys will like this.  Last night, at midnight, Hillary called me from St. John Island.  We were talking about funny answering machine messages and I told her that when I got home from Tim's last night there were three messages from Ashley Tatman.  Hillary said, "Well, don't you think you should call her?  It sounds like she needs to talk to you."  So I told Hillary all about Ashley.  All the BS, everything.  Hillary said, "No...don't call her.  I don't think I like her much.  Don't call her."  I said to her, "Hillary, Eddie and Mike will simply LOVE you."  Also, while we were jawjacking, two chained up monster dogs killed a wild pig outside her window.  The squeeling was insane.

      How about Houston?? There is a lot to do there. Dallas is nice too, but I don't know where anything is in Dallas, but if you went to Houston I could probably tell you what you are looking for.  So here is something I have thought interesting...  Top Rock, Hard Rock, Whetstone, Backdraft, Sideshow, Kremlin, Airedale, and Absolut. I have used all of these callsigns at one point or another in the 4 years I have been controling. I don't know which one was the most fun though. Probably Kremlin. Any guesses on where Kremlin is??

      I wish I was going to do something as fun as visiting Denver.  When Hillary returns to Florida, we'll  have 8 or 9 days together and I want to take her somewhere more interesting than Callaway.  Maybe New York City...that wouldn't be crazy or anything.  Who knows.  I've been practicing a few of my songs a lot lately.  I'm about ready to record them on my G-Series Takamine accoustic guitar.  I'm going to make a music video for it too!.  Yep.  And it's going to rule.    Now--I'm going to drive all over the place and take pictures of my new Sock Monkey in fun places...catching him in the act of defiling nature...and other things.

      Well, it's Sunday morning and we are going to head out to Denver for the day. I am sure that we will have a fun time. Updates to follow.  Yesterday we went to Cave of the Winds and looked at a bunch of caverns. It was fun walking through all the caves and caverns. We proceeded to check out some Indian cliff dwellings. The Indian stuff was cool stuff. Seeing how the Indians actually lived in the cliffs was very educational. We also went out to the Air Force academy. I have been there before but my family wanted to see it so off we went. It was closed to visitors but with my handy dandy active duty military ID we were in business!  Mungo, your propane story is some funny crap! I am dying! How are things going with you and Hillary?  Eddie, dude, I am sorry to hear about your Pops. What is the deal? (email me)  Not too much else to say at the moment. I have to go and eat some breakfast before my adventure.  ST freezing his butt off (-3 outside right now).

      This weekend was really fun for the most part... but back to work tommorow. I went to Seoul and saw the War Museum. That was really cool. Did you know that there were over 5 million Americans sent to the Korean War? I was impressed by that amount. Canada sent roughly 3300 or so and 1/3 of them either died or were injured. They need to learn how to fight.  Damn Mungo, I went and got propane filled one time by a retarded guy and he was very quick and didn't almost kill us. Man you gotta love Wewa's best.  Dude, I just finished reading your blog again for like the 4th time and I am about to drop on the floor laughing. That is too frickin funny.  Went out again last night, and the thing of not trying to drink has basically just been thrown out the window. Fuck it. Of course having bad news being dumped on my lap doesn't exactly make things easier. Just found out on X-Mas that my dad is having some really bad health problems. I hate Korea for this reason. I am too fucking far away to just take a few days of leave and go see people.   No worries though, I have made it through worse shit, this is just another one of those things that is made to make a person stronger and hate the military more.  I am sitting here staring at the screen now and don't have anything else to say so I guess that means to stop blogging.  Dueces Bros

        Tim and I went to the Fam Camp to fill the propane tank.  The crazy fat woman that did the service for us was...shall we say...incompetent.  Yes, that's it.  When she started to fill the tank and clouds of propane began to escape from the seal, the woman was heard to mumble, "Oh my!  Why, that's never happened to me before."  and "Mumble mumble it's in my eyes mumble mumble I can't see mumble mumble where's that screwdriver?"  And then, after 2 minutes of watching the propane thunderstorm gather around us, the woman dropped the metal screwdriver onto the metal floor, right beside the tank...causing Tim and I to flinch with a certain fear of imminent doom.  Luckily there were no sparks and we live to tell the story.  The last quote I'll leave you with was muttered by the fat woman as she handed the tank to Tim:  "Careful, it's all wet."  Peace and Love, Mungo

      I am a super retard. I can't believe I forgot my passwords. I thought that I had them backed up on my laptop but I was dead wrong. I finally figured it out.  Thanks for covering for me, Eddie.  Trip was good. Total of 14 hours with an hour lunch break. Ashlee was amazing. I have the laptop rigged to watch DVD's. I bought a little thingy for to broadcast the sound on a FM station so I can listen to the movie on the truck stereo since the laptop speakers suck. The laptop fits perfectly between the front seats so Ash can see it perfectly. Put in Blues Clues and Shrek...life is good.  Christmas was fun. I got neat crap! Flight Sim 4 with all the planes from the Wright Flyer until now. Cool. Also got Vice City driving game. I got a bunch of other neat stuff too but I won't bore you guys with it. It didn't snow here on the 25th but the 26th was snowy white.  It is hard to breathe here at 9,500 feet.  Uh oh, my Dad and father in-law are starting to talk about politics...bad news. I have to go ref. I will get on here again now that I can!  ST out.

      ST was going to blog until he remembered that he forgot his password to get in and Blog. Idiot. But here are some things from him...  He made it to CO fine and the trip went well with the Kid not even really crying. All good there, because I know what it is like to have a screaming kid in the back of a car for a long while.  Basically not much else other than he is having fun and forgot all of his passwords. Dumbass.  Anyway, Chrismas is over here and has been for roughly 12 hours. It was a pretty good Christmas. We ate like pigs. We had ham, turkey, yams, baked beans, stuffing, and more. Needless to say, I felt like I was going to have to be rolled out of the room.  After dinner, I got spanked in football on the PS2. I lost 35-17. We hung around for a while, then decided to go out. Curfew was 12 am so we couldn't be out for too long and we were starting to cut it a wee bit close (i.e. 2 min before 12)  We had a good time though. Even Kev went out with us, which is very suprising since he never really goes out for a drink. There was a LtCol's daughter with us last night. She is visiting from Idaho. no worries, she is 21 and she is HOT.  Flirted with her for a while, then the group of us headed over to my room. 9 people being obnoxious and stupid. One of the chicks could not wait for AJ to get out of the shower to go to the bathroom so she just went in there and did her thing. Did I mention we have a clear shower curtain? yup, so everyone got a show. man, I thought he was going to kill me, but he took it quite well and then hung with us for a while.  By the way, The Lt Col's daughter is Kev's CC's daughter. he he he... she was wearing a blue thong. It was nice.  Anyway, I hope everyone had a good X-Mas and stuff. Did anyone call L for her B-Day?? I did, but I am supposed to.  Later peeps.

      I did two things today...and today is Christmas.  #1 THING:  Found the bridge used in the filming of "The Truman Show."  Took pictures there.  #2 THING:  Went to work and wrote two EPRs.  One of them SrA Parker's (Eddie knows who that is), and the other EPR was my own.  I just got back to my apartment after 5 hours of painful writing alone in a brightly dead office.  Flouresent lights breed hostility.  Merry Christmas.  Happy Chanukah/Hanukkah.  Good Kwanzaa.  Blessed Yule.    Oh, hell! Happy Holidays!!!! (unless otherwise prohibited by law).

      My duty hours for today were:  0745 - 1200.  Today is Christmas Eve and our squadron was on minimum manning.  Most people were just required to sign in and leave.  The Chief sent everyone in the building around on details.  Mopping, sweeping, vacuuming, picking up cigarette butts, raking leaves, sweeping sidewalks, and the works.  I had to do it too, which is no problem, except that I'm trying to finish two EPRs that are due in the first week of January.  One of them is mine, one of them is SrA Parker's.  So we all finish up on details around 10 and I get to work on my computer.  As soon as I open up the form to start typing, Lt Col Cote (sq CC) comes in and releases everyone for the day.  I think to myself, "Wonderful!  Peace and quiet to do my work alone."  But then he made me leave too.  He didn't care that I was busy, he wanted me out of work on Christmas Eve.   He would not let me stay.  So what am I doing?  I'm working on two EPR's at home instead of at work...where I'd much rather be right now.  Merry.  Peace and Love, Mungo

      Kick ass photos of the lights... however, us camping was still the most amazing thing I have ever seen as far as the lights go.  Sounds like you and H are having a good time. this is good news to hear. Although, if she turns out to be another Ashley, we will have to beat her. But I doubt that will happen. This is good.  Luigi Begies.... I love that place. Cheap food that is good too. Didn't I introduce you to that place? that place just rocks.  As far as the driving thing... Dude, I am less inclined now to drive all over the US to see people. One of those "how bout you fuckers come here and visit me once in a while" things. I will end up driving all over the place anyway when I get back to the US, but I think I will limit it to MN and IL. Anyone from Houston can go up there and see me and L. I am debating flying from Vegas to MN with L, it would be so much easier.  by the way Mungo... where the hell has your sister been? I have not seen her on yahoo messenger in like 8 months. Well, If you go up there tell her I said "hey"  It is my kids B-Day today... well my today as I am typing this, but not her today until about 6 more hours. I woke up in a panic this morning because I thought that I was going to miss calling her on her B-Day. Go figure, It has not even happened for her yet, so now I have to wait at least 16 hours until I call her. I hate this much of a time difference.  Eddie waiting to call his kid....

      Bros,   Hillary and I found fun things to do.  We went walking around downtown (the Harrison parts) where things are fine and fresh.  The library is there...where we read across from each other for an hour...the Java is there...where we shared a scone and drank soy lattes and hot tea...Books by the Sea is there....were we escaped without spending too much money...harbor is there...where we explored and read the names of all the boats...the park is there were we admired the old men sleeping in the sun, and the post-pranked fountain filled with suds...   We went down to Mexico Beach to eat at a beach restraunt:  Toucans.  But it was closed.  Will not be open until Dec. 29th.  So we drove to Panama City to Luigi Begies (almost 40 miles away) and ate itallian.  No beach experiance there, but she will return on Dec 30th.  Hillary and I will be spending our New Years Eve together alone on the winter beaches of white-sands-Florida with warm blankets and a bottle of Ravenswood Merlot.  We're going to the hidden "East Crooked Island" beach.  That is the best beach in all the world, the Virgin Islands can't come close.   Hillary and I briefly discussed driving up to Osage making stops in Olathe and Ames along the way.  IF IF IF IF IF IF (I repeat: IF) we do it, we'll begin the drive 1 Jan 04 and be back in Callaway 6 Jan 04.  The next day we'd have to drive to Orlando, and I'd return with an empty car after saying good bye.  That's what is making us weary about going to Iowa.  All the driving.  I've already driven nearly 1,600 miles this week!  But we'll see.  I'd love to see family and introduce this girl to my family.  We'll just have to see.  Peace and Love, Mungo

      I went to the post office today and picked up my 2 yes TWO packages. One was from LtCol Mike. That was pretty cool. The other was from Super Turtle sending my shit that I had left at his house.  I like getting mail that is not bills or someone saying your car is being repoed. LOL...  I also got my OIF coin from the insurance company. I was definately impressed with the quality. Not some shitty coin that some cheap bastard makes into a Mx coin.  Where the hell is everyone????  I know ST is trying to get ready to go to CO, but where is the Mungo-nator and the Double Bubbles? I have a guess what Mungo is doing, but OO, you have no excuse. No your wife beating you for even looking at the blog is no excuse. Just do it while she is sleeping.   "Here's the mail, it never fails. When it comes I wag my tail. It makes me want to wail MAIL."

      I took some meds to get rid of my runny nose and now I am like sand in the desert! Better than a runny nose.  I just got done watching the Broncos whoop up on the Colts. This win lets the Broncos go to the playoffs! Yeah, Broncos!  It is 2100 and I have to get ready for bed since I have an 11 hour day all by myself. Nope, I won't see anyone else the whole time I am there. and we are actually shut down so there isn't any work to do except watch TV or read. Fun.  I also have to spend all my free time getting ready for the trip not too mention I have to wrap all of Beck's gifts before we leave. Too much to do. I am sure that the next blog will be when I get to CO and have some time maybe on Christmas day.  If I don't talk to you guys before Christmas then you all have a great one and I hope that Santy Claus brings all you bad boys what you want.  See ya...  ST out

      I just finished a fitness pre-test. I scored an 80.25. This is good. It means that I will pass when the test actually happens as long as I do as well or better. The 1.5 mile run kinda sucked though. 14:07, not the greatest, but at least I completed it.   Gotta run. Shower, food, work.  Eddie

      So kev and I went around town today looking for a pool cue. found one. got one. After that we went to eat. Terriyaki Chicken. Good stuff. After that, I went and ordered flight suit patches and then went home.  Not a real exciting day, but still a decent one.  Anyway... Damn I want that bike. If for no other reason than to say "My bike has all wheel drive, my balls are bigger than yours"  The pepsi incident is just plain funny only because I have been in that situation too many times. I have the drinking problem at usually the most in-oportune moments. Talking to a hot chick, trying to be cool, and then shit just goes south when you dump a drink down your shirt. It is even worse when you have a huge gulp in your mouth and someone says something funny and you 1. spray all over the place 2. choke on the shit or 3. blow it out your nose trying to prevent 1 or 2.  Dallas Stars are playing right now and Dallas is winning 2 to 1 agains the Tampa Bay Lightning.  A Christina Aguilara comercial just came on too... damn that is a hot biatch.  Very suprising to have a decent commercial over here. Most of them are AFRTS commercials where it is propoganda about the military or safety shit. I hate the commercials. Sometimes they have cool history ones.  I have often wondered about the phrase "fuck me running." I try to picture this and usually have problems. Do you realize that you would really have to be running at the exact same pace to do this, not to mention the geometry involved. Wow, the stupid shit that runns through our heads....  I have to be at work tommorow at 1030 or morlike at the gym at that time. Work actually starts at 1200. We are generally at work about 6 hours a day and do about 1 to 2 hours of actual work during that. Other times we play scrabble or just sit there and bullshit.  On another note, finance fucked up my pay and shorted me around $300 for the Jan 1 paycheck. Needless to say, this kinda fucks me because that is when my child support is due. Hopefully my travel pay will hit and I won't have to worry about it.  I can't wait to get the fuck out of this BS. People always say that I will not get out. I say "Fuck you Jobu."  I need a soda... brb...  I am back now, not that y'all noticed the difference.   After the gym tommorow I have to go and check my mail. Someone said I had mail on Friday and I have just been to lazy to walk the mile to the post office. Yes I am serious, the post office is on the far side of base and the only time I am near there is when I am at the gym.  This has been a long blog for me and I am very supprised that I actually typed this much. most of it, however, is stupid shit. But hey, what else is the blog for than to share with friends.  Out of curiosity, has anyone ever seen our blog as one that is on the list of "noted blogs?"  Eddie wondering about useless shit

      I feel like getting my blog on. Well, I almost wore that damn shirt with the Pepsi on it to Applebees but I caught myself at the last minute. While on the subject of Pepsi... The waiter at Applebees thought Beck and I were nuts when we kept telling him that the diet Pepsi that we ordered was actually regular Pepsi. He swore that he got it from the diet fountain but we said that there was no way it was diet. He finally went back for the 3rd time to get more and came back about 6 minutes later smiling. "You guys are good. The lines were connected wrong in the back. Sorry about that." We just laughed since he was so nice about it the whole time.  That was our adventure for the day...lunch at Applebees.  It is 1406 and I need to get to wrapping Christmas gifts and getting everything ready to road trippy.  Mungo, How is Hillary's visit going? Hope you guys are having fun.  ST out

      I don't even know someone named Fred!  I got up this lovely Sat morning at 0630 and ran to Wally World to get oil and a filter for the truck. Of course, they only had 3 quarts and I need 6! Bought what they had then stopped at the Wally near base to get the rest. Proceeded to change the oil on my beast and check it out for the trip ahead.  Yes, F'ing the F'ers would be time consuming. mlm   Well, fuck me running! I just now spilled Pepsi all down the front of my shirt! Crapola. Luckily it was my dirty shirt from changing my oil. Maybe I will change it or maybe I will just wear the damn thing all day! At least I didn't get it on the keyboard! That would suck.  Yes, I really wish that Bubbles would get into the blogging spirit and see how much fun it is. It will be sad when the book is made and there is no entry from him in here. Oh well, as someone else said...."Fuck the Fucking Fuckers!"  Okay, this Pepsi on my shirt is making me cold. I will go change now.  ST out   Advice: When drinking Pepsi from a can make sure it goes in your mouth and NOT on your shirt. Seems to work better that way.

Anyway, Mungo, I say it quicker because my vocabulary is limited and mostly just comprises cuss words. Therefor, I am unable to make anything last a long time.... to include marriage... he he he...  ST, I appologize about the recent die down of the blogger, but you have to understand that fucking the fuckers is time consuming and we must use large amounts of time stuffing a telephone pole up there fucking ass.

      Guys,   You know what?  Eddie has a bad day and describes it in a paragraph.  I had a bad day today and it took me an entire hour to tell Hillary about it.   That's right, an hour.   That's also right, HILLARY.   Hillary is cooking.  We're both drinking wine.  And we're both listening to 12 versions of Brown Eyed Girl.  The awsomist....hey, I'd love to tell you more about it, but we're about to eat some wonderful food and then get shitty.  I have this to look forward to...and I've been thinking about this moment since 0800.   EDDIE:  The jist of my hour long rampade story was this--fuck the fucking fuckers...we have something in common...and so far away.

      Vroom Vroom goes my truck! Boy, I said Vroom Vroom beeeatch! I have been wanting to get a performance muffler installed on my truck since I bought the damn thing. Well, today Beck said to do it. I did. My baby is mean and loud, now! Yeah, baby. It sounds so bad ass.   Eddie, did you think that anything would change from your last two bases? Just keep your shit to yourself and don't hang with any airmen! I think you are seeing the main reason that NCO's are supposed to "keep to themselves".   For all the shit I deal with at work I am sure glad that we don't have any Airmen running around like little pansy ass babies. Dude, just start reading books, messing around on your computer, whacking off more, watching TV, go to school, or some crap. It will help you save money anyway.  Good luck and keep us posted.

      So last night the "feels like" tem was 6 degrees. Some people in my squadron were saying "Lets go out" Eddies reply "Go fornicate yourself" except more vulgar language.  So get this... there I was... This one punk ass airman is trying to stir shit up at work about me. She said that I told her to "Back the fuck off" at the X-Mas party. Didn't happen, the person riding in the cab with me said it. So she told AJ, the roommate, and AJ came and talked to me. So I went up to the chick, and asked why did she say that I said something I didn't say? apparently this was too aggressive, because she went up to the SMSgt in the squadron and said that I had approached her and was really mean or something. The Senior went to AJ and told him to make sure I stayed in line. AJ talked to me and then I started to get pissed off. Didn't do anything just let it slide... mostly. my supervisor was gone so I talked to my flight sup and briefed him on the situation for the "Just in case" factor.  This does it my friends.... FUCK THE AIR FORCE!!! I have 2 years left and that is it. I am tired of the nitpicky bullshit and the kinder gentler mother fuckers that can't handle being told when they are wrong and have to mutha fuckin' cry about it. I would rather be a cop where at least I get accused of good shit like abuse of a guy that is 6'4" and 250lbs saying I kicked the shit out of him. I am tired of the political bullshit that if you can't handle something where you just straight up skip the chain of command and tell the highest ranker mother fucker you can find so that you can feel good about yourself. Incompetance is at its peak here folks, and these whiney, punk ass, little fuckers can all go and fuck themselves. Fuck the fucking fuckers.  Eddie out now happier.

      My sickness has taken over my whole body now. I called work and said that I wasn't going to be in today. I also called the hospital to try and get an appointment but they were all full (big surprise there!).  I did find out that I can get switched over to flight med. I will have to go up to base and do that today sometime. That will be so damn nice.  Trailer is in the shop getting a leak fixed. It should be ready today sometime. I am going to try to go to the hospital when I take my trailer back up there (RV storage is near the hospital). That way I can kill two birds with one stone.  Speaking of Christmas parties. I blew off the Commander's party, our office party AND the big work party that everyone stayed over for. I have a feeling that the people I work with think that I am not a team player....hmm...I'M NOT! At least as far as work parties go.  My headache has subsided so I can at least function to a certain extent. Still feels like an elephant is sitting on my chest and I am coughing up nuclear green shit. Maybe I won't go to work tomorrow either. I will have to see how I feel.  ST out (more like passed out).  PS. Eddie, I fixed the damn "Q" for you! Happy now?

      It has been to long since my last blog fix. more than 3 entries means too long and there have been 11!!! What the hell is that?  Anyway... Squadron X-Mas party last night. Show up, drink, drink, raffle drawings, drink, eat, drink, raffle drawings, raffle drawings, drink, raffle drawings (too many friggin raffles) drink, high ranking people talk, drink, dance, drink, smile for pictures, drink, dance the "Cotton Eye Joe," drink, socialize, drink, challenge someone to a "control off," drink, talk shit, drink, socialize, drink, have one more drink for the road, go eat. Drinking stopped, the amount of times you see "drink" is the amount that I drank prior to this sentence.  I had way too much and 0930 showtime for work came way too quickly. I have a problem. However.... all those drinks totalled up to a whopping $22.75. Booze is cheap here.   I am almost tired of drinking because I can not recover like I used to and it is too fucking painful in the mornings. but enough about drinking.... it makes me want to vomit thinking about it.  Mungo, sounds like you have a very busy schedule ahead of you.  ST, the "Q" is capitalized... remember.... big fuckin Q???  Bubbles, did your wife beat you for getting on the blog again?  I am not looking forward to X-Mas eve. I am very bummed that I will miss L's B-day. I doesn't really matter that much about missing Christmas with people because I am not a huge fan of holidays in the first place. I have not been for about 10 years. They annoy me.  Who the hell would want to know what is on your monitor at any given time anyway? some people are just too damn nozy.  Have fun in CO.  I have run out of things to say.... too tired  Eddie countin' sheep

      My brain is spinning around in my head. Spinning and spinning. Around and around it goes. Also, my eyes feel awfully poppy right now. They might just jump out of my head and dance a jig on the desk in front of me. I wouldn't be able to watch it, of course, because I would have no eyes! How crazy is that? To have your eyes dancing a jig and you can't even watch!  Don't tell anyone but last night...I heard my eyes talking to each other. Yep. I don't think that they know I was listening though. From what I can gather, I think they may be conspiring about something. I haven't figured out exactly what yet but I will soon. And when I do they better hope I keep my temper under control or I might just poke them out and kick them down the street! That will teach them to conspire like that! I just might do it.  I don't really know why my eyes would want to conspire against me. I have always taken care of them and never watched any gay porn or weird shit like that. I just don't get it. Maybe they are unhappy with the view on the back of my eyelids. Do you think I should put some pretty pictures back there for them to look at while I am sleeping or blinking? Would that make them happy? What kind of pictures should I put back there?  If I were an eye I think that I would like to look at some bright and happy colors. You know, I could put a different picture behind each lid so they will have something to talk about during their idle time. There are many possibilities here that I must explore before I make a decision about what to tatoo on the inside of my eyelids!  ST out

The video tape ended, rewinded, and the VCR blinked off and ABC appeared on the screen...the volume at a low level.  This did not wake me up.  But several hours later, deep into my sleep, I began to dream the sound of many voices yelling in the most intense fashion I have ever heard.  It was insane.  When I woke up, the news of Saddam's capture was breaking.  I watched for 30 minutes, my face must have been like stone.  Mungo

      This Christmas is not like past ones at all. We have not been in the mood to decorate or even get a tree. No, we are not Scrooges or anything of that sort. Although, it could easily be taken that way if you walked in to our home.   What is really different about this Christmas is that we are driving to Colorado for the last two weeks of the year. Knowing that we won't be here has just taken the desire to decorate and be festive and thrown it in the trash receptacle. We are bubbling over with excitement about going to CO!   I refuse to put up ANY Christmas stuff before Thanksgiving even though I think the stores are starting in July now or some crap like that. After Thanksgiving this year We decided not to get a tree since we wouldn't be here on Christmas morning to enjoy it and thus it's sole purpose would never be fulfilled. That would be a sad end to the life of a Christmas Tree, don't you think? So, no tree. We did, however, put up a few little things around the house but it just doesn't feel like Christmas unless you have moved half of the furniture around to fit the damn tree!  Now, I am stressing trying to make sure that we have the gifts for our parents finished in time! We bought a couple of really old windows that had the paint falling off and were just plain nasty. One has three panes and the other, just two. I sanded and cleaned the crap out of the three pane...or should I say three pain? At any rate, Beck and I then painted it and did the "crackle" technique on it so the top coat of paint is cracked all over and you can see the bottom color. I just finished painting it this very morning. Our plan is to go to Michael's and get some more glass cut to the same size as the existing stuff then put pictures of Ashlee and some dried flowers between the glass. Our parents will then have a three (or two) picture frame that they can hang on the wall! Unique, don't you think? I will have to get to work on sanding and painting the other one since I only have a week to go. WOW!  I will take pictures of how they turn out and post them so you can see what the hell I am talking about.

      "Welcome Double O!"  I hope you have found the time to read EVERY single thing the rest of us have written.  You better.  So there I was..."Where were you?"  I was sitting on my couch thinking really hard about cleaning...the next best thing to ACTUALLY cleaning.  Probably better.  Anywho, Tim timmy called me.  Timmy is my best friend down here.  He was hungry.  We went to Firehouse and I had a Corned Beef samich.  Wonderful.  Then we went to Goodwill and I bought chairs.  The chairs could be on the cover of a book entitled "The History of Linolium Houses."  One of them is in bad need of a duct tape job.  On the way back to my apartment to drop off the chairs, Timmy slamed on the breaks of his new Durango and said, "I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE!"  I didn't ask, I simpley waited.  We pulled into a parking spot infront of Toe Jams.  THE hole in the wall of hole in the walls.  Thus started the tour of of bars we had never been to before.  Which are few and far between.  I've been here for nearly two years and Timmy's going on five years.  But we found some.  Toe Jams, The Watering Hole, Genes, Side Pocket, and then to the old familiarity of the Sip 'n' Cue.  Which is where we ending the drinking/pool playing.  We started drinking at 4 p.m. and ended about 50 minutes ago (3 a.m.)  Insane crazy.  To end the night we (that is, me, Timmy, and Bill Coe) decided a little McDonalds was in order.  To make a long story short...it was a fiasco.  We started off with a little humor, it turned into war.  War between us and the Micky D's guy.  Bill Coe is amazing when it comes to drive-thru humor.  Totally histerical.  I'm just glad I'm not eating any of the food we got (after 20 minutes....AT THE FRIGGING WINDOW!!!!!!!)  I am tired so tired yes I am.  It is 3:58 a.m.  Certainly time to call it off for the day...night...morning...what ev.  Peace and Love, Mungo  "We live as we dream alone We break the spell and mix it with the others."

      Feel free to use whatever you want out of here for publishing... ST and Mungo only... all others have no copyright authority and will be flogged if used without written permission by myself, ST or Mungo.  I like the idea of the coffee table book... however... I dont think anything should be edited. We all know what we are really like and so can everyone else. If it is profane then oh well.  I got drunk last night and had a damn good time. One of my old troops from Mt Home asked me to dance with her and did some unexpected things with her boyfriend not 15 feet away. no fluid swap or clothes coming off... but still very interesting. Regardless, it was fun and I enjoyed it but told her I didn't want to end up in a fight with her boy. She said she didn't care, but she was drunk and so was I... bad combo... bad things happen that way.  It was still fun even when her hand went down my pants an hour later. Yes it really did happen and it made me very nervous. I think I have been out of the swing of things for too long. Well, nothing like jumping in like that.  Thanks for shipping the stuff ST.  ST and I are talking to Bubbles and trying to get him hooked... probably with little success.  Outie

      I just wrote a huge, long post and accidently deleted it before I published it! Son of a &#$@^!!!! Well, here is a summary.  Party was good.  Mungo, take what you like and do with it whatever you like.  Next year for Christmas I am going to have all of this blog printed at Kinko's and make into a sort of coffee table book for each of us. I will work out the details later. It could be a yearly tradition and we could have volumes or something. Only people that contribute to the addiction will get a copy. You don't contribute to the addiction, you don't get the high. End of story.  I think I said some other profound shit but oh well. I have to go mail Eddie's crap to him in K. If I don't do it today he might send a hit man after my ass.  ST kicking his own ass out the door.   Advice: Don't ever quote Chris Rock's skit about tossing salad when you are hanging out with a bunch of ex-cons. They won't see the the humor.

      I'm working on my book, right?  I'm bad at making dialoge sound like other people.  You know what I mean?  All my charactors talk like I do.  You see how that could be a problem, right?  So, my request is this:  There are several clever little quipits of writing on here that I would like to steal from you, MAY I DO SO?  For example:  "...is probably in the full swing of things at the party, showing his eyelids to people..." For example:  "...I will post more soon just because I like the feel of the needle in my arm..."  --please consider...Mungo

      Last night was the first night in MONTHS that I have gone out.  I went to the Sip 'n' Cue with some people from work.  (Kelly Burke, Kekay, Maria Duany, Thomas, Moore, Cheeno)  Everyone had an insane week this week.  Just hard and nuts for everyone.  The funny thing is, that the badness in each of our respective weeks was completely unrelated to anyone else's.  Different variables in each of our experiments...so to speak.  Is there such a thing as collective karma?  Dunno.  Anyway, we shot some pool, drank a few beers (seriously, just a few, none of us really drink that much) and then we went to the Waffle House for "waffle waffle waffle waffle!"  And it was so.  Now I'm thinking this:  I have until Wednesday to have my apartment in presentable order.  I am a total slob.  This weekend should give me enough time, right?  Well, it's already noon on this cloudy 62 degree Saturday in Florida...so I ought to get moving on.  I'm sure I'll be checking this again soon though.  Eddie:  King Diamond is too weird for me.  I'm listening to their song "Let it be done."  Weird!  I'd give you strange looks too.  Peace and Love, Mungo   MY song of the day:  Milencolin "No Cigar"

It makes me think of everyone and the cause of this is evident but the remedy can not be found because it's so well hidden."  --Eddie...you want to talk to Hillary?  Oh shit.  Okay.  She'll be here around 2 p.m. on Thursday.  You'll have all weekend...  --ST...how was the party?  Did you shake it like a poloroid picture?  I don't have much to say.  It was nice talking to Eddie today, always good to talk to the bros.  Ya?  Ya.   My right ear hurts like a sexy MF.    You see what you've done?  You've got me blogging with nothing to say.

      My squadron Chrismas party is next Wednesday. It should be fun.   As far as the firewalls... I also use a router and zone alarm. I don't trust anyone and they are all out to get me. That is why I own a small arsenal in the states. However, that does not do me much good here.  I just talked to L and she was drinking apple juice... I think the apple juice got more attention, but she still found the time to say "I love you Daddy."   Always good things to hear.  By the way it is 10am sat morning here and ST is probably in the full swing of things at the party showing his eyelids to people while he studies the inside of them in a corner. Or he is making smart ass comments and Beck is saying "Dear!!" in the way that only Beck says it.  I think we are going out tonight but I am not sure. There was something about someones going away party, but I don't really know the chick and don't really give a damn. So, we will see.  By the way tell the Lt Col to fucking write me back.  ST in CO with no blogger... that could be bad.... seems like it is time to bust out the laptop and install AOL for the trial and then cancel it when you get back. It is like smoking, booze and dirty women.... you just can't drop it like that.  Still have not paid for a juicey yet... and I dont consider the 1000 wan as paying for a juicey... It is less than a dollar and she was "dancing" at  a pole on a stage. But jiggling her titties would have been fun, but Eddie resisted because he is not that desperate....yet.   ST, Send me the # you are going to be at in CO.  Mungo, let me know when H gets there so I can call and let her know what your real friends are like. he he he..... :)  OO7, just fuckin blog man... everybody is doing it.  Zip Lip

      I was just reviewing the network security on the 5 computers running in my house. This reminded me to remind you about firewalls.  Here it is in simple terms. If you have a cable modem and are not running a firewall of some kind such as Zone Alarm or a router then you are stupid. Yep, I will tell you to your face that you are stupid. People can EASILY find your computer and steal shit on it. Just like leaving you car unlocked in Harlem overnight.  Zone Alarm is an award winning TOTALLY FREE firewall! If you aren't behind a router then get Zone Alarm from  urlLink www.zonelabs.com  It is simple to use and won't bog your computer down. I use it and a router.  For more info on security read here:  urlLink www.grc.com  It will scare you to learn how easy it is to get on your computer from the internet!

      I have to go to Beck's office party tonight and I don't want to go. The only thing that was going to make it bearable was that Dave (Eddie knows him) was going to be there with Jean but now he may be a no show. I am going to be so damn bored now! CRAP!  I just got an email from Lt Col Mike (was in AK now in CO, I don't want to use his name here). He wanted my mailing address so I am assuming that he is sending something for Christmas. Nice guy. I asked him to send me his # so we can get together while we are in CO and say hi.   Wow, only one week until we leave! Woo hoo! I don't think that I am going to have any internet for the whole two weeks I am gone so don't get all worried about little me. I will write as soon as I get back. I am sure that I will have a novella to write.  Well, the snow didn't accumulate at at the casa but the mountains right behind us got tons! We are going to have to take the dog and Ashlee up to play in the snow.  I will probably be back to write more after the party to share my pain. See ya.  ST slinking off...

      Well, the let's plan for early Sep. I am feeling good about this.  Eddie, I think you might want to just look around at what other jobs are out there with good bennies. It would be nice to have a stable job where you can stay with L more and not worry about the next war or deployment or TDY or...who knows!  Mungo, Right now you are pretty set no matter what you do. There isn't much holding you in or pulling you out so you can go either way. Look around and see what is out there. You might just find something cool as well.  Me...well, Beck and I have even discussed me staying in. I don't think it will happen though.   Maybe we should all go work up in Seattle and be in the Guard. No deployments, no wars, no hassles. Just lot's of clouds and rain. I am going to look into it because I think it would be worth the trade off for the stability and still keep military bennies and retirement.  Well, guys, hell has frozen over. Yep, it is snowing on my house here in Vegas. Yes, snow. That is wicked nuts! I have only seen snow here in Vegas once or maybe twice. It's not sticking but all the rain that we have been getting here has now turned to snow and it is falling faster! If it accumulates I will snap some pics and post them but I don't think it will.  I am sure that I will post more soon just because I like the feel of the needle in my arm, you know?  ST sledding off

      Yep.  I did it.  I wrote two award packages, four feedbacks, did 5 OJT briefings, scheduled 5 newbees for ALL their inprocessing appointments, scheduled 150 hours of sim, sat two missions, and other random things all in the last 24 hours.  I'm not complaining or bragging, not at all.  I'm just saying that I am VERY happy that I'm back to normal.  Now, today will be a beautiful 14 hour work day, but hey.  No biggie.  Vegas.  Beautiful.  I will be getting out of the Air Force and my last official duty day will be 01Sep04.  I remember when that seemed a long ways off!  Now it's just right around the corner, huh?  Just about 8 1/2 months off.  Ya baby!  But it still is awfully temping to just say, "Screw it," raise my right hand and wait for all that cash to roll in.  Moneys would make things a lot easier right now, but it's not worth 14 more years.  I say 14 because if I reenlist once, that's it.  I'm in for 20.    8.5 months, Mungo

      I think I can do the Vegas thing. I just have to sign up for my mid-tour sometime soon to be able to get it. I will do that tommorow.  Well dudes, I am beginning to re-think re-enlisting because of the recent findings and some of the past findings. No I don't really want to, but the reason is not selfish. I guess that means I will actually have to start studying for Tech.  I am bummed that I am nowhere near home with my kid, and yet again that is a reason to get the hell out.   Other than that, things are going fine. Work is work and the dorms are dorms.  Truth is... I don't know what the fuck I am going to do and I just felt like rambling.   I just watched a movie with Kev. "John Q" good movie. If you get the chance you should watch it. It is about a guy who takes a hospital hostage to get a heart transplant for his son. Some fucked up things though.  Anyway, did Bubbles say if he was ever going to Blog or did his wife have his nutz?  Later Bros  Eddie

      Well, I am chatting with Bubbles this very moment. We have been talking about us all getting together next year. 007 is serious as a heart attack about it. We are thinking that Vegas is a good place to meet since he has never been here and no one was too thrilled about the air races in reno. Reno is kinda boring by itself anyway. Yeah, I have been there.  Is this okay with everyone? We can stay at my house and use that as a base of operations. We can go camping in Utah, go to California and maybe even hit Mexico if the money is holding out. How does 10 days sound? That is the max Bubbles can take. I figue Eddie can take his mid-tour and stay in Vegas for 10 days then spend the rest of his time with L in Idaho or Houston or what ever. Mungo, we don't quite know where you will be! Will you be in or will you get out? Will you be able to make it? How about early Sep?  It is looking like this is really going to happen if everyone agrees. What do you think!

      Here is the email that I fired off to Abercrombie and Fitch about there use of full nudity in there most recent catalog. While I am for nudity as much as the next guy I don't think it should be used to sell clothing by a company that caters mostly to 12-18 year olds! Since I have become a parent this type of thing has really been getting to me.   EVERYONE SHOULD GO TO THE ABERCROMBIE WEB SITE AND EMAIL THEM YOUR THOUGHTS! TELL YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY AS WELL! Their site is:  urlLink http://www2.abercrombie.com/   Since a national boycott was launched about a month and a half ago their stock is down more than 15%! That is hitting them where it hurts! Below is the letter....   To whom it may concern, I would like to express my outrage with the current clothing catalog for your company. It is no wonder that it was pulled and is no longer being distributed. Using nudity to sell to kids is deplorable!  I will not be shopping at A&F until the company cleans up it's image. As a member of the United States Armed Services I will be letting everyone that I know including the base news paper about your ridiculous gimmicks to try and make money and ask them not to shop with your company.  Even the very front page of the A&F web site has a man and woman making out and there is not one stitch of clothing visible! A&F does sell clothing, correct?  Sad....

      Pu-Tang and Cheese sticks...That made me laugh out loud! Thanks guys.  Needless to say, I was so excited to see new posts on the blog action! Yeah for blog. What a strange addiction.  I worked last night but got to sleep in the chair for over 5 hours so I am wide awake this morning. I got home and kissed the wife and kid but then took a different route than I had planned on in an earlier blog post. I some how got in the mood the fix the two sinks in the master-bath. You see, having a wife with long hair tends to clog just about every damn drain in the house! I took the "P" traps off and cleaned out enough hair to make a wig! That took me about 30 min...30 stinky ass minutes. But now the sinks drain like all the knowledge from my head.  I then came to check my email. I got an email from my Aunt Bobbie in Houston telling me that her daughter (my cousin, duh) got a couple of ferrets for Christmas and was wanting to know what she needs to do to take care of them. HA! The email I wrote took me over 35 minutes to write. I told her all about EVERYTHING she would need to know about ferrets. All the work, cleaning, attention, vet bills, supplies, biting, stealing, jumping, pooping, hiding, bathing, nail clipping....on and on I went. I did, of course, tell her that they are the best pets to own if you are willing to put in the time and effort it takes to own one. I can't wait to get her response. I know she was thinking that it would be like taking care of a hamster or something like that. They aren't home much and I don't know if they are willing to put in at least 4 hours a day into watching ferrets run around acting the fool. I will let you know what happens.  Maybe Double Bubble is the smart one by not getting addicted to the blog action! You think? Nah! I think that Julie has him tied to the couch and trained as her personal sex slave! That sounds more like it.  Yes, we need to get online and chatty chat. Now with the whole Big K time difference Eddie needs to tell us a good time for him. I don't think that Thur chat time will work.  1900 Vegas = 2200 FL = noon Big K = 1800 AK  Eddie will be at work unless he gets time for lunch. From what I am coming up with one of us will be at work or asleep all the time! Rats!  I tried calling you, Eddie, during my overnight but it was about 0800 in the K. I will be working reg shift tomorrow (your Fri) so I will call you around 0500-0600 or so. I hate to wake you up but I can't call much later since I have to go home from work soon after that and you know that I can't just stay at work to chat with you.  ST tunneling out....

Hope you're enjoying the Big K.  That reminds me of K-Mart.  I'm sorry you have to be away from your daughter, I can't imagine, of course, what that would be like, but I know how much you love her.    Okay, boys, I have to go to work now.  It's getting on to be that time, ya?  My awar packages are due in 5 hours.  I haven't even started one of them.  Last night sucked ass.  And today I woke up at 4:30 a.m. and went to the gym.

      There was nothing that happened today so far of any relative interest, but I decided to add to Mikes addiction by writing something anyway.  I sat through 5 hours of briefings today (0700-1200.) Bunch of long winded people talking about crap that the last person and the person prior to them talked about. It was hard to stay awake and there was no coffee available.  I think I officially go into training on the 15th, which should be a cakewalk assuming I know the difference between pyonyang and pu-tang or something to that matter.  As far as what I need to talk to y'all about, it has nothing to do with MJ or the new station casino in LV. Just stuff that I don't want to put on the blog.  its nap time for me.  Eddie

      I'd like to start this blog off with a two line conversation I over heard at work that kept me laughing (and on the positive side of sanity) all day.  "I'm hungry" "I have some cheese sticks in my pocket."  That's it.  Hillarious stuff there. Okay, so my day started yesterday.  I didn't sleep for a single second last night.  Could not do it.  Seriously.  My mind is too busy for all this.  So I get to work and whaddya know, the two weeks I thought I had to write two quarterly award packages has now been cut down to 1 day.  Yep.  I had all day to write two packages.  Oh ya, and four feedbacks, five initial OJT briefs, a dental appointment, a mobility appointment, two live missions, and 18 cheese eatting airmen running around.  Did I finish the packages?  Hell no.  So, I brought them home.  Home!  "Home" is usually a term I regard with much revrence.  It signals the end of shitty days.  It's the second click of the stop watch.  ...."and....TIME!"  Punch out.  Strip off the uniform.  Surf the net.  Read a book.  Listen to things.  Home is a good word.  But it is meaningless on this day...a day that I need to hit the pause (or reset) button and wind down, drink some nyquill, and go to sleep.  But, oh my brothers, no.  I have two packages to finish before I get to work tomorrow.  Oh ya, and an ALS graduationn to attend in one hour.  The program tonight is 2.5 hours and I will get home at a quarter to 9.  I can't explain further how tired I am.  Or how much I hate my job right now.  But at least I had this: "I'm hungry" "I have some cheese sticks in my pocket."

      I must get ready to go to work. Eddie is probably about to get up from a night's slumber. Wipe that drool off your mouth and start the coffee pot. Get in the shower and wash the stink away.  I will be working from about 1500 until 0100. I will then sleep in the recliner that we have in the office until I have to be awake again at 0400. I will then work until 0630 at which time I will proceed home. Once I get home I will kiss my wife and baby girl. I will then promptly go into my office and check this blog.  You see...I think I am sort of addicted to the blog thing. Perhaps it is the fact that we can communicate with each other but not have to send emails back and forth to each other then make sure to send copies to the others. Maybe it is just the fact that I feel like we aren't so far away from each other. Hell, now we are all over the world! I check the blog before I go to bed. I check it soon after I get home from work. I would check it before work as well but since I get up at 0400 and am out the door by 0410 I don't really have the time. On the weekend I check it several times a day (usually just when I get a chance to get on the computer. Yes, guys, I am an addict. I wonder if they have a 12 step program for me? Oh, hell....I don't need no stinking 12 steps!  I am really looking forward to seeing all the neat things that Eddie has to say about the big K. I am sure that he will have adventures to share with us. He now has a digital camera so I am looking forward to seeing what he sees.  ST floating away...

      I go to bed at 2230 my time and there is nothing on the blog. I get up at 0930 and get on here at 1000 and there are books to read! Cool beans.  Mungo, Very well written. I am impressed...really. I will have to read it a couple of more times. Warm field singing songs of your youth with your wife? Nice. I could do that. As far as getting out of the AF goes, just get a job at the post office. You can go on your route delivering mail and listen to music all day. Military get in easier as well. I tell everyone to get a job with the post office. I think that is my back up job if I don't find something that I really like when I get out.   Eddie, Live ammo? Funny shit. I would have just turned it over to the Military Cops. Let me know what happens with that. Now, what do you mean depressing news? Michael Jackson is guilty? Don't tell me that because I don't think I could handle it right now! He would NEVER touch a little child! AAHHHH! Okay, so what is the deal? I will try and call you today which is Tue here and Wed there. So I will call into the future! I will be getting to work late today because I have to stay up all night for missions. I would have called you yesterday but the shop wanted to have a damn meeting and I barely caught the ride home. It will be about 0800 for you when I call and you might not be home but I will be at work all night so I may catch you. Hope all is well.   I would like to write something to 007 as well but I don't think he likes us anymore. And to think, he wants to plan a trip next Sep? Yeah, I don't think that will happen. He doesn't even talk to us anymore. Oh well. Still love the Bubbles.  See yall...  ST blasting off...

      I am back on the blogger Gents.  I am now officially writing from the Big K. It is funny that we call it the Big K yet Osan is small enough to walk anywhere and get there within about 5-7 minutes or less.   There is snow on the fucking ground. I got here and it was fucking raining. The weather is just plain going to suck while I am here, and I have acknowledged that.  Well, work is going fine, mainly because I have yet to actually work. Just in-processing crap.   On the other hand... all of my stuff got here. It was nice to see everyting again and more than what I expected...  THIS WAS BAD!!!!!  So, I am going through my stuff... set up computer... set up PS2... put clothes away... all normal stuff so far... Start digging through the other boxes with extranious shit in it... guess what I find??? 1 hydroshock for my .45 and a box of ammo for my .380.   Needless to say, I called customs after debating with someone why it would be a bad idea to just throw it in the trash. (yes, I was on the sane side of that one) Customs has yet to call back. Though I did leave my name, rank and #. Kind of odd... live ammo, and they don't call back... must have been the end of the duty day.  I know quite a few people here that I have met throughout my career. Many of which I had worked with at Tyndall while TDY down there.  I miss my kid.   not a whole lot going on other than that... however, I do want to get both of you online with me at the same time so I can tell y'all something. No, I am not getting married. It is actually more depressing news.  You my Dawgs,  Eddie.

      So many factors are unknown to me about my future.  In the unwritten book of my life, the one that exists in some untapped ESP resource in my mind, I am lost in the plot.  I don't know if I'm half way through, if I'm a quarter read, or if I'm one page-turn away from a two letter phrase in bold:  THE END.  Who knows where we are on our own timeline.  Not I, said Mungo.  Not I, indeed.  Suppose this:  I will live a long heathy life and die at the age of 87.  A good day to die, somewhere, perhaps, in a warm field with my old wife singing the songs of our youth, rejoicing our youths and our long happy lives together.  Let's just suppose that.  And say that each week of my life was a single page in that book.  Certainly a long book.  4,524 pages...or so.  Likely printed in a leather bound, nine-volume, collector's set.  That is the most I could possible hope for.  The best end to a life I could envision is just that.  And we'll say, for the sake of the blogger (and my continued happiness in general) that it does come to that.  I would be on page 1200, or there abouts, and can look back on so many pages with so many feelings cropping up.  So many beautiful friends, so many sad times overcome, so many happy times remembered twice as strong.  And from where my book mark lies today, I can say this:  Thank you, oh my hommies, for providing so many of those good pages their vast upheavals of beatitude.  Thank you.  But now, suppose this:  I live to the age of 87 still, but instead of weekly pages, the book of my life progresses only when I do.  I advance the plot by my actions and activities only.  What page am I on now?  Maybe page 800.  Not too shabby.  And this, oh my brothers, is where I find the root of my questions.  The source from which all doubt and fear come into play.  How many more pages will I write?  Will I keep on?  Or will my book, still 63 years from completion, take only 100 pages more to complete?  Will I grow stale, enfeebled, and lax?  Or will I take hold of myself, make far-reaching advancements towards pure bliss, and life a life of expansive adventures?  Where will my personal narrative lead me?  I am faced with overt life altering decisions now, at the age of 24.  I, as you all know, am federated in the United States Air Force.  The contract binding me to service is due to expire in less than one year.  Eight months, two weeks, and six days...to be exact.  To stay in will guarantee two things:  1.  The peace of mind of stability.  I will never have to worry about remaining employed.  I will never have to worry about how I will make all those "Next Month's"...    2.  I will delay the inevitability that one day I will have to face my number one weakness:  My unwillingness to pull free of a lackadaisical state of mind that has been with me my whole life and has (and shall continue to) agglomerate my dreadful fear of the future.  If I chose to separate myself from military service, there are no guarantees.  Not even the seemingly logical guarantee that I will face my chickenheartedness to face what is to come.  Not even that.  This is the choice I am leaning towards, and that choice fills my daily thoughts with enormous misgivings.  What will I do with myself?  What is on the next page of that book?  I have no idea.  Now, being the sole author of that book, I have found inspiration and sought advice from outside sources...and have included them heavily in the reference sections along with making those sources critical roles of my own life.  I would not be where I am without my friends and my family and the book of Erik Kershner would be a shit read without ya'll.  And it is now you that I turn to.  I cannot turn the next page without first finishing the one I am on now, so I turn to you.  I put down my pen and turn to you all for advice, encouragement, and maybe the right word combinations to put my mind back on track.  Because right now, my mind is not on the right track.  It is 1:25 ahoy   I got off the couch at 1 ahoy because I could not sleep.  I have been lying awake with ruminations and dreams of winning the fucking lottery.  It's up to 32 million dollars here in Florida.  I cannot stop giving attention to this head trip.  Of course, it's natural of me to be in this state.  I'm in a position where my worst fears are on the horizon...and winning the jackpot would be an instant and easy way around this hideous confrontation.  Hokay, I'm done.

      Trans Siberian Orchestra. Just got back from the concert and it was absolutely amazing. This year blew last year away! Lasers, flames, smoke, hot chicks, it actually snowed on the audience (yes, it did)....oh yeah, amazing music. If you ever get the chance to see them...GO!  Coaxer it is.  Eddie should be on here within the week. He is getting DSL hooked up or he might just share DSL with his suite-mate.    ST signing off.

      ST: I think we have already named my phone.  Not Stanley, no.  But:  THE COAXER.  I think so.  Perfect.  ALL:  I talked to Double O after I talked to ST.  Then I went to sleep.  Hillary called me at 4 a.m.  That made me happy, I had been wanting to talk to her all day!  I was asleep when she called and she had to get to bed so our phone conversation didn't last long.  But she's going to call again on Wednesday.  She finishes with her finals on Tuesday.  I can't wait to talk to her.  On Wednesday we talk about "The Thing With The Thing."  EDDIE:  Happy days in Korea!  I have your digits.  DOUBLE O:  Send those pictures, brother!

      K is for Korea. Eddie made it to K. His suite-mate is AJ, TSgt Johnson (ID tech in AK when we were there). Eddie says it is raining there...yuck.  K is 17 hours ahead of NV. 16 ahead of AK. 20 ahead of FL. I called Eddie at noon on Fri here in Vegas and woke him up at 5am on Sat. Odd. I asked how tomorrow is looking so I have a heads up.  Well, Mungo, have you named your coaxer? I thought about it and Stanley isn't a good name. Odd how it seemed good at the time but then after sleeping on it (the idea, not the coaxer) it doesn't seem as good. Oh well, I hope he is standing guard over you and keeping you coaxed.

      Coaxer, yes, Stanley?  Humdum.   Today is going to be a busy day.  I had to get a lot of sleep for today...I did that part last night.  I heard a Super Turtle speaking to me in my dream, but didn't realize that it had come to me from my answering machine.  Not until this morning at least.  I want to stay here, at the blog, and chitty titty chat about this an mibby that, but it's time to forego the 71.8 degree F of the indoors and venture into the wet damn darkdamp 58.1 degree F of the out.

      Congratulations on the new phone!  You say that he is a coaxer? What kind of things has he coaxed you into doing? Is it the motivational type or the mischief type?  I am sure that you are comforted by the way it stands guard over your abode. It's eagerness to serve you at a moments notice. Exhilarating!  Does your new compadre have a name? I don't know why but Stanley sounds like a good name for you to consider.  I think that I will call you right this moment! Yeah, that is exactly what I am going to do! Here I go!

      Thanksgiving is over, done and gone. Eddie was here for two weeks and now he too is gone. This week is the first full week that I will have worked in over a month. For now it is work as normal and life as normal. Being back to the same old same old kind of leaves me with a sad and empty feeling inside. Wow, can you image what it will be like after Jan 1, 2004 when the whole holiday season is over?   On the bright side we are going to see the Trans Siberian Orchestra this coming Saturday. We have tickets for the front row so we should have a great time. Of course the joy of the concert will be off set by the "commander's function" that Beck and I have to go to the same day. I don't want to go but it is one of those things where you should make an appearance. Oh well, I will make the best of it and keep looking forward to the concert later that night.  Our trip to Colorado is coming up in almost exactly 3 weeks. I am excited to see my family and go skiing in the mighty Rockies! Woo hoo. What are all of you freaks doing for Christmas? When I say all of you freaks I guess I am only referring to Mungo since Eddie will be in Korea and 007 never posts on here anyway because he never has anything to say. Or isn't allowed to.  Eddie is in the air right now heading over to the big K. I hope the trip is going well for you Eddie. If not then don't complain to me because I don't want to hear your bitchin.

      It is 1351 on this lovely monday afternoon.  I am at home.  I have a mission at 2300hrs.  That kicks buttocks.  That means I'll only be at work for the length of one mission and I wont' have to go in tomorrow until noon!  That is totally the wicked awsomist.  I bought a new phone.  I had to.  I have horrible luck with  TELAphonies.   Phoney Balogna!    I now own a black, yellow, and gray vtech 2.4 gig phone and it stands proudly over my laundery baskets and book shelves.  He's a coaxer.  The phone is my apartment's very own motivational speaker.  Happy to hear you two had a good road trip.  I was going to go on a trip this break.  But decided not to.  I was going to go to Birmingham and take pictures of high high bluffs and cliffs.  It's weird to see them.

      I have finally updated my website with current pictures. Some of the pictures were cropped in a hurry since I am tired, sorry. I would like to know what you guys think. I have more but I can't put them all on my site. I guess you could call it a sampler.  Beck says that I have ups and downs and it can get on her nerves. I understand where she is coming from since just the other day I was all excited to get new carpet for the house since it really needs it. Today I snapped at her and said I didn't really want carpet. That wasn't cool. I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it but I shouldn't have snapped at her like I did. I also tend to worry about finances more than I should.  Hopefully this St John's wort will even me out a bit. I would like to see if it works before I go into the head shop and get stuck on Prozac or some crap. I would insist that they try me on other stuff that is much more mild that Prozac first. I don't really want to be a walking zombie.  I do think that this stuff helped a little even though I just started it today. I really don't feel as irritable.  On a side note. If you haven't seen the movie "Along Came Polly" you MUST go see it! Beck and I saw it last night and I about pissed my self! If you find Ben Stiller even slightly amusing then you will fall over laughing. You can even go with guy friends. Classic.  See you freak boys later. I need sleep. It's now 0100. Time kid wakes up...0630. CRAP.  ST

      What the fuck are you taking those for anyway?  So, I went downtown today... Today was not the day to go. They will not move on prices. This is because it is payday and will not haggle on any prices. They know we got paid and they use that to their advantage. I guess I will go again next week when they think everyone is broke.  wow, I am sitting here, stairing at my computer with nothing moving in my mind. I guess that means stop blogging.

      So, what's wrong with stick men? You got something against stick men? Huh, stick man?  Is St John's Wort supposed to make you jittery? I feel kinda jittery. I was looking up some info on it and found a funny little snippet (yes, I said snippet). The site is:  urlLink here .   This is the snippet (said it again): "Other studies conducted recently have found no benefit from the use of St. John's wort for certain types of depression. For example, the results of a study funded by Pfizer Inc., a pharmaceutical company, found that St. John's wort, when compared with placebo, was not effective for treating major depression (Shelton, et al. JAMA, 2001)."  Let's see here. A study conducted by a drug company finds that a drug alternative isn't effective. Why would they find that? Maybe because they want to sell DRUGS?! Duh! Stupid, stupid. I don't know if the study was skewed or not in favor of the drug company but I don't tend to trust studies funded by an "interested" party. You know?  I am going to go and be jittery now. Although, I must say, I do feel kind of mellow and on an even keel. Maybe next time I won't take 4 at once. Do you think that when they say "3 a day" they want you to spread them out or take them all at once? I took them all at once and even added a fourth for good measure. What?! Grandma used to always add a little extra sugar for "good measure" when she baked, right? So just back off!  ST

      I read your song of the day and I immediately go and download it if I don't have it. I then hear it and am listening for what you are feeling that day. I feel all squishy inside after that knowing "This is Mungo's song of the day"  Okay, so anyway, ummmm ya....  I think I like Bubbles without and internet connection better. He blogs more often. But he called me a name that none of us have used for me in a long, long while.... WTFO?? I think he listened to my ex-wife too often or something. Either that, or when he came down to Houston listened to my family. That my friends, was a great time, even though ST was not there. Now I am going to be the one left out.  We seriously have to make plans for another hook-up time for the future. Just the bro's. ST, I love your wife and OO you have a wife, but we all need to meet in something like Montana or Vancouver or something where we can either camp or party with just us 4 being there and no relatives anywhere around.  On the flip side, I need coin designs. This is something I have thought about doing for a while since I got here and I am going to do it. A coin for the bro's. I will cover all costs but I am not artistic. Creative, but not artistic. I was thinking along the lines of our names all on one side with some design with our career field badges since it is the AF that brought us together (Mx, 1C5, 1C5D). On the other side it would have something to do about camping or biking or both. I would like full color ones and I am willing to spend some cash for this. If you have an idea or have someone that can draw it up, email it to me. This will happen, but hopefully you will not rely on my skills to make it happen or we will have stick people on the coins or something like that.   Do y'all all like that idea??  later bro's

It will be cool to go back and see what you were thinking about on a certain day. You know, when the book comes out.  Speaking of books. When are we going to be able to get a copy of yours?

      Okay, that's my joke.  I thought it was funny.  I just got off the phone with Mikey.  Always good to talk to the bros.  Eddie, one of these days I'd like to get up with you on the phone, but to do any kind of serious talk, I'd have to have time at work to do that, and lately with my AWOL airman, others on quarters, another getting an Artical 15 for his 4th "alcohol related domestic abuse incident," training matters, time doing my ACTUAL job, and loafing.... I just don't ever have any time.  But one day soon, me hopes, I have your digits in a drawer at my desk.  I don't have a whole lot to say.  Other than the Super Bowl Party I'm going on on Sunday, I have intentionally made NO plans for this weekend.  I want a quiet weekend, I want to be alone.  I need Mungo time.  We all do, we all need time to slowly push the "reset" button.  This is my time to do just that.  Like I just told Mike, I'm going to eat some potato salad out of the fridge and watch a movie.  I have 30 minutes left in a Robert DeNiro movie called, "The Mission."  It's old and good.

      I rember the drive... what I was awake for anyway. It was on fire when I got to go through it.  The Stinking Rose rocks. That place has awesome food. We saw Tori Spelling there to. Not impressed by her though.  So, I was thinking.... Is anyone gonna want to get together when I get back from the Big K. This more applies to OO and Mungo, since ST has my car and it is obvious I am going to see him. If not, I guess it looks like ST and I will have to go to AK at some point in time. VINL has been calling our names since we have left.  I am chatting with Mungo right now and nothing exciting is happening so I can't think of anything to write about.  Outtie

      Where did everyone go?  I am in California now and the weather is great. Traffic sucks. Hotel room is nice. I am hungry.  The drive was very uneventful and boring. It took about 4.5 hours to get here so I can't complain. Eddie remembers how ugly the drive is.  I have a couple of hours to kill before Beck finishes her training for the day. I think we might head into Beverly Hills to eat dinner at the Stinking Rose. I think it is going to become a tradition when we come to LA. The only downside to driving to B.H. is the drive itself. Rush hour LA traffic. It will probably take at least an hour and a half to get there and about an hour just to get back (less traffic on the home part).  It costs $10 for 24 hours of internet! Rip off and a half. Yes, I could have done the AOL free trial thing but then I would have been stuck with dial up. I think Beck will get reimbursed anyway so I am a surfing fool.  I will talk to you guys later.  ST

      Lets do those dates. The only thing I have is that I can't take all that time off. I will only be able to take that first week off. The second week I will have to work so you guys will be on your own there as far as stuff to do. I was under the impression that 007 would only be able to take 10 days max. I am so excited about hanging out! Yes, I wish Eddie could make it but I understand 100% why he isn't going to.  I went to bed late last night and got up early this morning. I am dragging a bit right now so I don't have much to say. Talk to you ho's later.  ST

      I now officially feel left out. Not that it is y'all all's  fault. But it makes me want to reconsider. However, I won't. The time with L is more important to me.  Bummer that the course was hit. I guess that means I will have to go to Korea to golf.... oh wait....  I made the drive from AK to Houston in 5 days and that is 5,000 miles. You can make it if you are willing to drive that much a day. But you have to hope that the second time around the bumper doesnt fall off since it is hanging by the screws in the license plate bracket.  I had my pre-eval mission today. Everything that could go wrong, did. Airspace issues, late takeoffs, slow system, crazy ass Koreans... you name it, it did it, with the exception of an IFE... that will probably happen during my eval. I should be qualified sometime next week at the latest then it is into MQE... more training so I can control CAS missions. Then, after that, instructor upgrade training. After that, I will be good to go. Man, this place sucks.  Eddie

      Gents,   Well, mostly Mikey,     I just got off the phonezilla with the man.  The Bubble.  The O Dub.  We talked about the September 2004 calender.  He says that he can leave AlAskA when he gets off work on Saturday the 4th.  Chill on vacation.  Then fly back two Friday's later, the 17th.  We discussed the possibilities of him driving with me up to AK.  But!  Nope.  It's nearly 3,500 miles and he just doesn't have the week it would take to get there.     SO:  4SEP - 17SEP  :HOW'S THAT LOOK?      Hokay!  Peace and Love,                  Mungo de Bungalow

      This week should be fun. Beck is headed to CA for some work training. She will be gone Mon night until Fri morning. I am going to overnight on Mon so I will be home early on Tue to watch the kid. I am going to take off on Wed and drive to LA to meet Beck. Amy will watch Ashlee for a couple of nights.  While Beck is in training on Wed and Thur during the day I am going to head out and take pictures around LA and maybe the beach. I hope to get some pictures like the ones from CO. I am excited about just being able to run around LA and not have to worry about anyone except myself. Should be fun.  One of the nights Beck and I want to go to the Stinking Rose for dinner. Yummy! I think that it will be a great time not having to look after Ashlee for a couple of nights. Beck may go a little nuts since she won't see Ash for 4 nights in a row and I will only miss her for 2 nights. I am sure that we will survive.  We will drive back on Fri.   I may not be a blogging fool this week. I will be taking the computer and hotel has high speed internet access so I might be on with some quick hello's and updates. I am home most of the day on Tue so I will jump on then.  Talk to you fools later.  ST

      Swearingin was here, at Tyndall, when I got here.  I am now filling the NCOIC position he filled in my flight.  Apparently he's a bad NCO too, not just a bad controller.  So, the shitty AWO, what's his name?  If he's still an AWO that means he graduated not too long ago, right?  Perhaps I know him.  Maybe, Eddie, instead of trying to make life hell for him, you could take him under your wing, nourish his failed controlling skills with words of wisdom, compassion, and caring.  Turn him into the best damn controller in the Air Force.  I bought $73.13 worth of groceries about 20 minutes ago.  I saved $2.06 by using my Winn*Dixie card.  The check out girl said, "Oh!  You can buy a new car now."  On February 6th, 7th, and 8th I will be hiking somewhere.  We will be camping two nights.  Don't know where we're going yet, and it's really hard to find anything down here.  I have a lunch at Wingos that says The New England Patriots will win the Super Bowl next weekend.  This guy, Kush, is betting everyone and anyone who says The Carolina Panthers will lose.  That's an easy lunch.  If I can get my scanner working I'll send you guys a picture of Hillary and I...IF I can get it working again.  I have a brass bell with a fish handle.

      So I did absolutely nothing of note this weekend. For the most part just sat around and watched movies or played PS2. I was going to go out with this one chick but she ditched me. Ya well, she said it was because she didn't know where my room is, and this may actually be true, just because unless she is stalking me, she didn't know where my room is. She does now so who knows. Fucking women. I smell a game here, and I hate games.  No changes for me for September. Still planning on taking leave in Dec. It is my year to have L for B-day, X-mas, and N-Year (figured I shortened everyhing else, so why not New Year too.)  Early morning mission for me today. I say early, because if we are at work and actually working by 0900 that is early. I have to be at a brief at 0800 over at a fighter squadron. I am red air against a shitty AWO. This dude sucks, so it is time to show him how the E's do this shit. I must get at least one kill. It is my goal to make there debrief a living hell.   I am also already being told that I will be an instructor shortly after I get upgraded. Fuckin woopididoo!! I told them that I didn't want to instruct and was told "your going to instruct because we are going to need you to fix the fuck ups that our instructors are doing now" Nice... incompetent instructors. Of course, one of the instructors is Swearingen from AK. You may remember him as Booger. Yes, the one that had his finger up his nose to the second knuckle at most times. He was a shitty WD back then and still is today.  I think my DOS is 12 Jan 06. This will put me at 9 years 4 months and 15 days. This will also be 9 years 8 months and 3 days after I had graduated highschool. Damn, this makes me feel old, but at least I am not as old as ST.  Anywho, it is time for me to start getting ready for work.   Eddie chillin... literally... it is like 10 degrees outside...

      Mikey,   Sounds like you're having a great time.  Eddie,   Have there been any changes to your plans regarding next September?  Both,   When do you guys get out of the AF (if that's the way you choose)?  This weekend has been kinda wierd.  Because of all the things going on at work this week, I decided a complete departure from The Norm was called for.  So, on Friday, I bought some Tequilla and jumped off my private fishing peer.  Last night, Saturday, I played 25 games of pool and got a ride home from an off duty chick cop.  But, other than that, nadda in the Bay Area.

      So...Beck went off and left me with the kid for the weekend. Her and a friend went for a girl's weekend out. It is only from Sat morning until Sun morning.  Ashlee and I went to I-Hop for breakfast and chowed down on some pancakes. Yes, just the two of us went and we had a great time. I don't care if the people sitting around us thought I was odd for having full conversations with a 1 1/2 year old kid. Okay, so maybe it is a little strange to pretend like she knows what I am talking about and answers me back. What's the big deal?  We then went to Best Buy and looked at everything. I was given odd looks from the employees as I left my daughter sitting in the cart and walked around the isle saying "Where is Ashlee? I can't find Ashlee!" while I looked behind boxes and at the ceiling. I would then turn and run at her yelling "There she is! I am going to get her!". She was laughing and screaming so much that I think some people came to see if I was abusing her. What is wrong with a Dad making a fool of himself for the enjoyment of his daughter? Huh? What is wrong with that? Well, back off then! Geez!  Our next stop was Discount Tire so I could get the truck tires balanced and rotated. I was getting sick of the shimmy at about 65-70 mph. It took about an hour and Ashlee was absolutely wonderful!  Once we made it home Ashlee didn't want to eat so I gave her a ride in her wagon then we watched Shrek for awhile. When nap time rolled around she was so worn out that she slept for 3 hours! I had to wake her up.  Breakfast had been such a sucess that I figured that I would give Applebees a try for dinner. That was also a sucess. We had a great time and shared some ice cream after our dinner. Yummy.  She is now sleeping soundly in her bed.  I think it may be time for me to catch some z's.

      Yeah, my camcorder is 2000 or maybe 1999.  I am sure that I want to get out as well. The only way that I would stay in is if something really bad happened and I didn't have much of a choice.

      Yup..... this don't supprise me Mungo.   ST, what the hell was that crackhead thinking? And they wonder why SSgt's at 9 + years are getting the fuck out... well, there is your reason. When I get to Hill it should be interesting. I already have an attitude of "What the fuck are you gonna do to me?" It will probably be worse when I get there. I will have to mention one person from there on my resume' but that is about it. Other people will probably be one of you, LtCol Mike, and someone from back home... gotta add variety to the peoples. So what I am really trying to say is "Fuck them".   Dude, I spent over an hour and a half looking at dark tips last night, well this morning for y'all... but anyway, they tell a lot of different shit on there. Don't you have a pre 1998 Sony???

      So.....AFTER SrA Parker's Enlisted Performance Report (EPR) becomes a matter of record I was called into the commander's office with the Chief, the Director of Operations ((DO), and two of the Assistant Director of Operations (ADOs).  Each of them apologized (at the commander's order) that I wasn't consulted with the rating changes and that they didn't follow Air Force instruction (AFI).  Their reasoning:  "We didn't want to cause further delay on and EPR that was over it's suspense already."  The fact that it was over it's suspense is due to their oversight.  I was told I wouldn't even have to write this thing in the first place, that the directorate staff would handle it.  So I took all that time off when Hillary was here.  I got back to work on 08Jan04 and a MSgt tells me:  "I don't know where the hell you think you've been, but your EPR is 9 days late!  It was highlighted in front of the O-6 this morning."  So, somehow, all this became my fault.  I took 8 inputs and transformed them into 18 lines on the EPR in 4 hours.  That was a furious 4 hours.  And then you know the rest there.  They didn't like the 4 I gave her, changed my rating and the rater's rater rating (RRR), destroyed all hard copies of the EPR I had, the stupid fucking Justification Paper we have to write (explaining why we feel anything less than FIREWALL on the front side is warranted) was destroyed and rewritten, and several of the actually bullets were changed.  Numbers were buffed up (such as:  236 hours became 650 hours), lines were added to include volunteer work that had never been done (she had zero hours of volunteer work in the last year) and my "mark-downs" on the front were changed.  And of course, fuck me, I can't prove a damn bit of it.  So I got an apology off the record and a "strong encouragement" to drop it.  Guys, I almost wish I had another shitty airman whose EPR was due in like, two weeks.  I'd do it right this time.  Unfortunately, I don't.  But that one will be due in July...one month before I'm outie.  Mungo

      Yeah Mungo, you must explain. Let us have the skinny.  I had a MSgt flip out on me this morning. I was given a tasking yesterday to update the unit web page with some information. This MSgt that had nothing to do with the tasking decided how he wanted it done. I politely suggested that we wait and see exactly how the big boss wants the information presented. NOT a good thing to say. MSgt got really excited and started telling me that this is how it should be done and that I should be proactive. I continued to explain that all we would be doing is creating more work by doing something that was just going to have to be undone if the boss didn't want it that way. I just wanted to wait for the official tasking. MSgt went home for the day.  So I made up the page EXACTLY the way that the boss told me to. It was run up the chain and I got an email from the Commander thanking me for a great job. Of course, the way they wanted it done was opposite of what MSgt was saying.  So, today comes around. MSgt sees the work that I have done and starts going off about how I didn't do it right and that some critical information is missing. He was already excited and I haven't had the chance to even get one word out. I was PISSED! I told him that instead of getting mad right away why didn't he just ask me why it was done this way. "Well, why the fuck is [sensitive information] missing from the page!?" I got mad and said that I did exactly what the boss said. It was run up the chain and approved so don't jump on me for it! He lost it. I simply told him that I didn't want to talk about this anymore and that we should wait until my supervisor came in to discuss this. He just wouldn't shut up! I was called a cocksucker at least twice among other choice words. Finally he told me to get in the office. (yes all this was in an open environment).   I said that I wanted to wait until my supervisor came in. "Get in the damn office, that's an order!" So I asked another MSgt who had been watching it all to come in too. I wasn't about to go in alone. He just kept going off about how I wasn't professional and that I had better start showing respect to senior assholios...I mean senior NCO's. I just about jumped out of the chair! Me? Me? This bastard was telling me about being professional when I had not uttered one swear word that whole time? I laid in to him about it and finally he backed down on that issue a little. The other MSgt that witnessed it all had to tell him that he was the one that began the whole thing by going off. He told him that I had done exactly what I was told to do!  Finally, ding dong calmed down and just told me to watch how I speak to senior NCO's in the future. I just about fell over. I got up and left the office. The rest of day went well.  That is my story. May 2006 can't get here soon enough. See Ya!  ST

      OK.... here is what I think of EPRs... they have 3 signatures on them. Yours, your supervisor and the CC. Other than that, they can not make you change a damn thing other than spelling errors. I have had this battle before and won. I had a troop that was worth shit. They told me to write an EPR and a dec on them. So I wrote the EPR with no intention of writing the dec. I wrote a 3. There was a huge argument between me and a captain about why I could or could not write this. Here is how it went:  She said "you have nothing to justify a 3 EPR"   I said "have you read the reg for EPRs?" That stopped her pretty cold right there.   Then she decided to add "Well, If I wrote your EPR right now I could give you a 3"   My reply... "You do what you have to do, but she is not getting above a 3 from me, if you don't like it, that is what the rater's rater block is for. You mark what you want and I mark what I want."   So then she started about the dec "You cant write a medal with a 3 EPR"   My response "Exactly!"  At about this point she through her hands up and left the room. The EPR never ended up going through because the chick was getting out anyway all because of the 3. So the lesson is if you right a 3 you do not have to write an EPR...   I HATE writing EPRs  Fuck the Corporate world... BIATCH

      Bros...it's too too too long of a story to even summarize here (it's a month long dealyo) but just know that I was 5 telephone buttons away from making and official I.G. complaint about my Chief, D.O, and CC.  I reconsidered after many hours of deliberation with my supervisor, my directorate superintendant, and my first sergeant.  They didn't talk me out of it, they just posed some very interesting points of view.  Today, the Chief and I had a 2 hour "conversation" that ended my duty day.  I didn't say a word.  In a nutshell:  He changed the rating of an EPR I wrote from a 4 to a 5 without telling me.  Peace and Love, Mungo   Song of the Day:  Neutral Milk Hotel "Two Headed Boy"

      I do one overnight and come back to a freaking novel. Sweet.  I am glad to hear that Mungo has some prospects. Alaska would be fun! At least you have some options available to you.  You are right about releasing pieces of our lives. Kinda sad. I guess there isn't much we can really do about it though. At least there is this blog which I think is much better than email since it is easy to follow. Also, the history is all right here at the click of a button. I am trying to read past posts so when I make the "book" it will be fun to read.  My overnight was boring. This morning when I got into work my profile crashed and I couldn't work or do anything for over 2 hours. I just watched TV and drank some coffee while I ate my stack of pancakes. Today I got my weekly allergy shots and I am about to jump in Eddie's car and cruise up to base. I have to go to the education office and apply for tuition assistance. I really want to take this class. Intoduction to Criminal Justice. Completely online course. Wish me luck!  ST

      "Here's a thought. Because none of us here are near to each other, and all we know of each other's lives is what we release piece by piece leaving the rest to our imaginations, I guess it doesn't much matter what I actually do for a living."                --thas is what I said   But this is how it should have read.... "We don't see each other that often, an even though we hear from one another five times a week, we'll never know everything about each other's daily lives.  That's impossible.  I could end up doing any one of these jobs, and could continue our communication in the exact same way."     Mungo

      Okay, like I said before, time will pass.  It's a nasty habit of this existance of ours.  It is now 4:14 a.m.  I went there and wrote in my bouk.  The only reason I'm not still there is because my waitress was overly generous with the coffee.  On one hand, you'd think that constantly refilling a coffee cup is second best to have your very own pot on the table (that hasn't happened since the old VI days), but on the other hand, caffine has a way of moving ones boules.

      So, speaking of-a ma bouk... I plan on doing some writing in it this morning.  Midnight has come and gone.  It has completely passed me over for earlier hours of the morning.  For the time being, it is 1:32 a.m.  Time will continue on through the minutes and hours as I fritter and waste my time away.  So, instead of doing that, wasting my time:  I will, instead, take my notebouks to Coram's (Waffle House-ish) drink coffee, eat eggs and toast, and write small bits of this and that.  I could do that here, but I'll only be distracted by everything in the world.  Wanna read an excerpt from what I have so far?  Do ya, STUPID!?

      So, you want to know what I actually plan on doing when I get out for a job, huh?  I'm also guessing you don't want a lot of sarcasm.  Because, if you want, Eddie, I could lay it on pretty thick.  Okay, so it's kind of hard thinking about this because I don't know where I'm going to end up next winter.  I'll either be in Osage, Iowa, Dubuque, IA, or Anchorage, AK.  So, here I go, I'll break it down in my three choices in acending order.  3.  DUBUQUE, IOWA (of Sara Jean lore)      - Americorps (temorary child tudoring jobs)      - Be in a band  2.  ANCHORAGE, ALASKA      - Kitz Camera (in the Fifth Avenue Mall)      - Bum (drinking Listerine outside the Wal*Mart on Northern Lights)      - Be in a band  1.  OSAGE, IOWA (most likely)      - Press News (pictures/stories for Pops' paper)      - Dayton Oaks (technically not in Osage, but in Dayton, Iowa)      - Be in a band  So, there they are, eight outstanding job opprotunities for Mungo.  Each providing the nessessary implents of living the good life.  The mostly likely choice I'll make is working at Dayton Oaks.  (That's the camp I worked at before I joined the Air Force.)  What I expect to do there is mere speculation and dictation on behalf of my imagination... so far, anyway.  But what I want to do there is essentially what Jack Nicholson did in "The Shining."  I'd be the care-taker of the lodge and the grounds durring the off-camping season.  Before the snow falls I would also like to do some serious trail mending.  There are 50 miles or so of interwinding trails along the Des Moines River valley there, and many of the longer trails have fallen into disrepair.  It's a sad thing too.  I will also petition State-Funding for the resoration of a stretch of the Old Chicago Railroad that traverses 8 miles of Dayton Oaks property.  When not out on the trails I will be clearing snow from the roads, conducting minor maintanence, clearing fallen branches, sawing-carving-painting informative and directive signs to guide first-time and repeat vistors to their appointed locations of concern.  Ho-kay, so, if I don't do that, I'll end up working for my pops at the Mitchell County Press-News once again.  I had a wonderful time working for the newspaper.  I would like to learn as much about the job as possible over the winter.  Eventually, I would like to start my very own newspaper...and use it to warp and wash the brains of men and women world wide.  Then again, I might just end up in the basement of my parent's house...locked away with a type-writer.  I'll finish the book I'm working on now, and I'll carry my drafted manuscript with me everywhere.  My hair will be old, and my eyes will be crazy, and my clothing will stop fitting...and I'll just be about as cool as anyone you ever saw.  And these are my plans.  I could go into greater detail about camera stores in AlAskA, I could speak to the concerns you'd all surely have about me bumming around downtown Anchorage, I could talk about my as-of-yet showcased talents as a rockstar, I could talk about tutoring chillins with the AmeriCorps.... but these things I'll leave to your imaginations.    Here's a thought.  Because none of us here are near to each other, and all we know of each other's lives is what we release piece by piece leaving the rest to our imaginations, I guess it doesn't much matter what I actually do for a living.

      I am happy for you bro. That is good that you found someone you enjoy spending time with. You are making a good decision too. Keep your head clear and focused on what your plans are for the months to come. Don't get out and have no plan on what you are going to do.  I myself, would put in an application with the SLC PD today if I could. However, kinda hard to do an interview from Korea. So you never have told us what you actually plan on doing when you get out for a job. Just a bunch of sarcasm. "I am sensing sarcasm" "you should, because I am laying it on pretty thick"  (Tommy Boy)    L is back from AK and she got one of those Radio Flyer pedal cars. So now she is like the little radio flyer with her trike, wagon, and car. Man that girl is a spoiled brat. And Daddy is just going to add to that. There are some leather jackets that I have found for her over here. Each of them costing a whopping $25.   Speaking of jackets... I go to one store to buy a flight jacket because I need one for my flight suit and the gortex looks gay with a flight suit... the old man tells me $100... I was like damn... They cost $125 from the envision store but this is Korea. So, we (Stasa Howells and I. Yes the chick from AK and ID that drove me insane but we became friends somewhere in ID...) but anyway... back to the shopping... We go to this other store, where incedently they make our patches for our suits... $25... same jacket... no differences.... man I love the shopping here. Don't love anything else, but at the least the shopping is cheap. I also found a place that will MAKE me a leather Dallas Stars jacket for $140. Yes, full up dimensions and everything. Very nice. I have seen some of his other stuff and he does a good job too. They take pride in their work here which is much different then many people you find in the US. If I go there on an off day and am the first one in the shop I could probably get the jacket for about $115. They have a superstition about not making a sale on the first person in their shop for the day. Also, a very bad time to return something. They will throw salt at you to wash away the bad spirits and no I am not joking.  So anyway... that fucker ST has not given me his sizes for his fucking jacket. PUNK!!!

      As much I want Hillary to move to Florida, as much as she wants to be with me here, as strongly as we feel towards each other, as much as we desperately want to be together, we've decided that she needs to stay in AlAskA.  I will visit her there in June.  I will visit again after the Vegas trip in Sept...(by the time I get there it will probably be October).  And I may or may not stay there for the winter.  Then, in the spring of 2005, we're going to hike the Appalachian Trail together!  Guys, I found her!  Mungo

      Since ST is now done playing with his large drill and big wood and contemplating getting a bigger drill... I don't know where I am going with this one...  Mungo, do what you think is the right thing. We throw out our inputs, just to give you a broader spectrum to think about. I would say wait until she is out of college or at least at a good transfer point and you are established after the AF. But if it works out earlier, then hey, it works out.  Nothing exciting for me on MLK day. Just ate Popeye's chicken and watched a movie. Real fuckin exciting. your MLK day is just starting as mine has just a few hours left.  I go into work tommorow at 1545 my time. That is a lot of idle time between now and then. The hardest thing is going to be staying awake long enough to not wake up at 8 a.m. and be fuggerred up by the time I go to work.  I will probably write more later just because of strait boredom.   blah, blah, blah,  Eddie

      Walking down the road with night following me closely I hurried into the nearest store. Dandies Candies, I believe. Yes, I think that was the name. Names and even faces seem to blur together lately. I can't really tell you why and I am not sure if I care. Probably just old age.  Yes, yes. Back to my adventure. Dandies Candies. I hurried through the old wooden door which bore many scars from countless hands. I wonder how many people had pushed this particular door over the many years? I am sure that someone famous has passed through. Just think of all the hands and the history that goes with those hands!  So where was I? Oh yes. I had just gotten home from work and Gloria was still cleaning the house. Hold it...I wasn't talking about that! What was I talking about?  Screw it. It couldn't have been important if I can't even remember what it was....

      Look at Mungo acting all growed up! Man o man. Seriously though, good for you. I am sure that you will both be happy that you didn't just jump into it. I think that you would have been happy either way, actually. Planning out something that big make a lot of sense though.   My monster shelf is coming along great. I have the first 8 feet totally done and the second 8 feet is 90% done. My only problem is that my drill is only 12 volts and dies WAY too fast and doesn't charge up fast enough. I think after I am done with this project I am going to get an 18 volt drill and use the 12 volt as a back up. If you guys are ever in the market for a cordless drill make sure to get the 18 volt one! I wanted to save some cash so I got the cheaper one thinking that I wouldn't need the bigger one....yeah right. For the most part I don't need the big one but when you need it you really need it! Learn from my mistake...the bigger the drill the better. (That didn't sound good at all)  All is well in my world. I am off to shake it like a polaroid picture.

      I think when I call her tonight I'm going to have to say no.  It will cost a whole lotta money to move her here and I don't think either one of us could afford a move like that, the job market sucks down here, she just started a semester of school, she'd be leaving her current roomie alone, and there wouldn't be anywhere to put her stuff (that's not really a big deal) ...besides that, I'll be leaving here after the first week of August.  I'm not saying I wouldn't love to have her near, not at all...  I'm saying it's a huge step to take and I don't think either of us is ready or able for something like that.  We are, however, both very willing to do it.  Shucks, we'll see.  Mungo   Song of the day:  The New England Patriots - "We're Going To The Super Bowl (And You're Not)"

      Today is Sunday and life is just fine. I will be building some shelf units in my garage that will hang from the ceiling. These will be built from scratch and be 16 feet long by 34 inches deep. I went to Home Deposit and bought all the wood and hardware that I will need. Needless to say, I am very excited about the project. I will let you guys know how it goes.  Maybe I should eat some food now. Yep, I should.  ST

      Ya know bro, I think I am going to once again have to agree with ST. Go for it. This should not come as any suprise though.  The little things really are the key here. You also have to figure out things such as bills/food/chores. Let me give you a bit of Eddie's insight. Realizing this is slightly tainted, but hey... Is she going to have a job? Are you going to have a job when you get out of the AF? What is the plan for paying for stuff? The you buy your things I buy mine shit just doesn't work. Shit, even AJ and I just buy shit knowing the other is going to eat or drink some of it. Not a huge deal to us, but we both are respectful of the others stuff. We don't wipe out the fridge on eachother.   Here is another aspect... If she does not have a job, what is she going to do during the day? Is she going to sleep until 1500 then go to bed at 0600? All things to consider... Now, honestly, she seems like she is probably a hard worker and this will  NOT  be a problem, but I only know of her what you tell us.   As you know, you are the one we are concerned about. This goes back to the Andrea thing, as well as the Ashley thing, and the Willow thing... get the picture??? Just don't make any off the wall decisions.   Like I said, go for it, if it is really what you want and I will back you all the way. I don't think there have been any time where we did not back you. We may not have agreed with you, but we have always backed your decisions.   Just, for the love of God, make sure she doesn't have some fucking psychotic things that will drive you insane.   As for her.... just make sure she knows your little quirks... i.e. napkin and knife thing. and the OCD shit...  Good luck bro.  Eddie

      Mungo, I can't believe you are going to hear this coming from my mouth but you are so get ready...  Get her ass down there with you! If she can afford to move then get up on it!  My only word of caution is this...step back for a sec. Is there anything and I mean ANYTHING about her that tweaks you or annoys you in even the smallest, tiny little way? Now, don't just yell out no. Think. You guys were all in love and crap when she was there and that can make you not really pay attention to little things that might bother you once you are living together.  Things totally change when you have to live together. Her leaving clothes on the floor or dishes in the sink or not keeping CD's in alphabetical order...crap like that. Those examples may not relate to you at all but those little things become BIG when living with someone.  Don't get me wrong. I am all for her moving. You should be able to tell if she has major issues by now. You are an expert at women and their issues so I am not even going there. You know better now so I trust that you are making a good decision with her. Just consider all the little things as well as the big before a major decision like moving in.  Sorry this post is rambling and doesn't flow very well. My final thought and over all feeling about it is DO IT. Why not? Good luck and KEEP US INFORMED!  ST

      Dude, I am happy as pie for you! I am glad that everything went well with her trip and that you hit it off so well. Happy is good. Everything else going well?  Not much going on here. Today I qualified with the 9mm and attended a class on security forces training. Augmentee type stuff. I will probably never augment but it seems like a fun and easy additional duty to have.  I am going to start taking classes at UNLV so I can get my criminal justice bachlors degree before I get out of the AF. Speaking of classes...I have to go and sign up online! Later guys.

      My OJ has no pulp.... but there is the calcium additive. Football is good. I miss playing in the front yard with my brothers and occasionally my sister. Yes, my sister tried to play, and as Mungo knows, she is not a big girl. but she would try upon occasion anyway. I think it was just so she could hang with 4 out of the 5 brothers. The eldest of us never played. We didn't play touch though. It was full on tackle, the only exception was on the walkway to the house. Cement never felt good to fall on, and we were all pretty good about not killing eachother.  GOOD NEWS!!! Pops MRI came back and it was nothing major. he is on some meds now, but it was not a stroke.   However, the get together, will probably still not be in my future for this year. I would like to hook up with everyone, but timing sucks. I really, really, really want to spend a lot of time with L when I get back, and the only way to do that is to take the leave at the end of the tour. However, when I get to Hill, I am all for it. I will make time there. This also gives Bubbles some more time to save. Mungo, if you get the chance to go and hang with ST... GO FOR IT. Camping is a blast.  Good to hear that everything is well with Hillary... don't forget invites and you had better not fucking do it while I am in the big K. I will have to shoot you. My first stop back in the states is LV, and I can pick up my guns there.  Gotta run... work is calling....

      I played touch football today with some of the guys on my flight.  Great time.  I haven't played football since high school.  I threw a touchdown pass.  Just call me Peyton Manning.  Wait, I'm guessing that in certain house holds he's the devil.  Just call me Tom Brady.  He da bomb squad.  Anyway, we all had so much fun that we'll be doing this a lot in the future.  Perhaps twice a week!  Good times, good times.  Tonight I'll be watching "Underworld" and "Pirates of the Carabian."  My buddy Carl is bringing it over.  I'm lending him a bunch of camping supplies for this weekend.  He's camping out somewhere south of Tallahassee.  And I'm kicking the cigarettes again.  Goin' on two days now.  Drinking lots of OJ.

      Good OJ, Ya'll....I mean...Y'all.  So, here's the dealyo.  I am completely in love with this girl.  Yep, it happened again.  She didn't make it very hard on me.  I guess I didn't make it hard on her, we're in love with each other.  And it's wonderful.  We didn't really do a whole lot while she was here.  We played pool a few times with a bunch of my friends, we went out to eat at several restraunts (there's a new place called Mori's.  Japanese food.  I had sushi for the first time in my life and it was fantastic), we went out to the beach at night, we drank margaritas, beers, and wine but never got drunk, we read together, watched movies (lotsa movies), and all the other general kind of hanging out things.  We went to the Panama Java (Eddie knows it) and drank coffee, ate scones, and read books for a few hours in the afternoons.  So she likes most of the things I like, she has fun doing nothing, we like the same music and movies (yes...even all that crazy crap I listen to, she knows a lot of it!), and we both come from very loving families that support us all the way.  I have spoken to her mother, father, and brother, and they were all very very cool about her staying here with me alone.  In fact, her dad asked Hillary, "So, what have you two been up to...that you can tell me about?"  To me, that means he knows and doesn't hate me.  I'm happy, guys.  I'm really happy.  There is no pretense to our relationship at all.  We've both admitted potentially embarrassing things, things that might end other (lesser?) relationships, and we're still happy.  We're both jazzed.  I am going back up to AlAskA in June.  I will see her again then.  I will also see Bubbles!  And speaking of seeing Bubbles, I'm going to get out of the Air Force.  I'm sure of it now.  Unless the bonus goes up to a million dollars.  So.  I won't have a ton of money either, but I'll definitely have enough to get out to Nevada and travel around, camp, do all that stuff.  For sure, I'm in.  And if Eddie and Bubbles can't make it for their own reasons, I'd like to go anyway.   Boys, I'm very optimistic about my future now.  I'll be dept free when I get out, I'll have a bit of money saved up, I think I've got a girl that will be around for a long time, and I'll be a free man in less than 8 months.  I'm also making great strides in my 2nd book.  This one, as I think I've said before, will be over 800 pages...and right now, it's all in my head.  Slow roasting.

      Here are some words.  I can't blame you for not wanting to take leave, Eddie. I would do the same thing. How is going with Pops?  Maybe this year is not such a good idea for getting together. Mungo isn't sure what he is going to do with the AF. Eddie should save his leave. We know 007 is in a financial bind since he can't afford any internet. I have a lot on my plate too. Let's just think about it for awhile.  I have been up all night and I have a lot to do today. Woo Hoo.  Talk to you freaks later.  ST

      Ok... so here is the deal... I was having problems with the wireless network. i.e. it was working very slowly and did not like to connect to the router. My laptop still worked, so the access was still there, I just like being on the desktop better. So I reconfigured a bunch of shit, this was a trial and error type deal. I lost the connection on both at one time, but that was quickly resolved. It really sucks because they are both on the wireless system and configuring anything when you have no connection is.... well, impossible to change the router settings. But I figured out what I did and I was back to 1 working. Then after farting around for a few more minutes, EVERYTHING worked and it is now fast on the desktop again. It was a matter of changing thresholds and channels. I don't know why the thresholds had anything to do with it, but changing the channel did. I understand the channel thing because some just work better than others in certain areas or how the router feels that day.   Long story short, I can use the desktop instead of the laptop to make entries in the blog.  Went to the optometrist today and, from what he said, my vision is getting better... don't fuckin understand that one since I have not worn my glasses in about a year. But I need them to pass the next flight physical so I got them, then went to the AAFES store and bought 2 more pairs than the standard look ugly AF glasses. (one sunglass, one normal) The ones they gave me were not BCG's though. Same style as I have gotten for the past 6 years of having to wear the fuckers though. They also told me I need my eyes dilated and my appt for that is at the end of this month. woo hoo. I will be basically blind for 4 hours and look like a fool with sunglasses on inside. I will have to bust out the Oakleys for that. Some cool points must be kept since I will probably be walking into shit all day.  Something else I have now started is trying to get my hair back in my bald spot. I have started steroid shots in my head. The doc does not know how it will react yet... it may grow back... it may not. Either way, at least I finally got off my ass to do something about it.  I test for TSgt on 25 Feb. I am not studying nor do I plan to study. I will try when the test comes, but no extra effort will be afforded to this cause. If I make Tech, then I will have to reconsider re-enlisting. This is why no extra effort is being put in.   Mungo... it has been more than 12 hours since you have posted. I see how you are with promises. If there were psycho pussy on here you would commit to your promise. he he he.....  Trying to get hairy again... Eddie

      Okay, Here is the scoop... Right now I couldn't tell you if I will be there or not. The situation with Pop's makes me not want to use any leave except for emergencies. Although my bro's getting together means A LOT to me, I do not want to be in the hole if I have to go and see my dad.   I am really sorry that I can not commit. It would honestly be a great time and I do not want to miss it, but I think I am going to have to.   Although, I will have L for X-Mas and new years this year, so I would like everyone to be able to see her. Right now, The only one garaunteed to see her is ST. That is just because he is near where I am going, not because I hate everyone else.   With Calypso, I am not telling you to drive her more, but feel free to do errands with her whenever you want. The milage is far less than what I would have put on if I were there. Good to hear she is running good. I may have to give you money to put one of those bad ass exhaust systems on there. That would be cool. I think I will have the Saturn for a long time. I like to look at other cars, but I just can't find anything (in my price range) that I would want instead of that car.   Where is the 24 hour update from MUNGO????!!!!  anyhoo... peace  Eddie

      I just want to do a sanity check for everyone about us getting together later this year. I am all for it but I have a couple of restrictions for myself.  1) I know that I am going to be tight on money since we are taking 4-5 vacations this year. Most are just weekend camping trips but that can cost $200+ with gas and food for us. In Oct (the month after our get together) we are going to Disneyland again for Halloween. We did this last year and it was a blast...it was also about $900+ not including tickets. My point is that I will have enough money to go camping for 3-5 days up in Utah but that may be about it. I will pay for the campsites and most of the gas since you guys all have to pay to get here I don't.  2) I don't really drink (maybe one beer every 3-6 months) so I won't be getting drunk. I don't think you guys will care but I just want to put that out there. You guys are free to party on...it won't bother me. Heck, I will be the DD if you want to go bar hopping here in Vegas.  3) I will only be able to take about 5 days of leave but if you add the weekends in there that is 9 days off. Of course, with military leave, I have to be in Vegas for the weekends but that is fine if we go camping during the week.   That is about it. I just want to get what is on my mind out there so everyone knows what I am expecting. What are you guys thinking? Let's all be honest and REALISTIC (money wise) with what you guys want. If you don't even want to go camping then that is fine but it is probably the cheapest activity that we can do for 4-5 days. Post what you guys are thinking and then we can call 007 and see what is on his mind.  Also, I want to make sure that everyone is really going to make it. Mungo will be out of the military so money might be a consideration there. Eddie is in big K so his leave might be a consideration there. 007 can be a bit flakey but he swears that he is going to be here and already has the money for tickets. 007 also said that he will be on a tight budget too...I am sure we all will.  Okay, I am done rambling. Let's hear what you are thinking so we can all get on the same track.  Later,  ST

      Eddie, your car now has a whopping 25 miles on it since you left. I took it and drove up and down the freeway then to Starbucks for some coffee. I have driven it twice so far. I was worried that I haven't been driving it enough but it started right up like new. With it sitting in the garage I think that I will take it out once a month for a spin. With the new battery in it I don't think it really needs to be driven once a week like I thought it would. Now, if you want me to drive it more I can but I don't think it needs it and you can save a ton of miles this way. You might want to call your insurance and tell them your car is getting driven less than 1,000 miles a year and not being driven to work. You might save some cash.  Mungo, still waiting on updates....  007, you aren't on here so screw you! Ha! I can make fun of you and you will never know...unless you use someone else's computer or get internet again. Okay, fine, you are the coolest dude that I have ever met and I and honored to know you! Seriously though, I hope you are able to get back online soon.  ST out

      Our wonderful neighbors now have a big, loud dog. It barked all day yesterday and then all last night. Beck and I woke up at least 4 times to that stupid barking! Tonight I am going to have the phone right next to me and the neighbors address ready. That dog barks once after 10pm then I am calling the cops. I will call the cops every 30 minutes until that dog shuts up. I am also going to look up the law about dogs barking ALL day. I know there is some NV law about it since it is disturbing the peace. I will research...or just call the cops and ask.  I think Beck is getting the painting bug. I am sensing that soon she is going to want to paint a room or something. I can just feel it.  Today I am going to Best Buy to look around at neat stuff. I am also going to Wolf Camera to get a picture blown up to 11"x14". I can't wait to see how it comes out.  Beck is going to church and Ashlee will go to the nursery for the first time. Beck is a little nervous about it. I am sure that she will be fine but I am kinda wondering how she will do as well.  So, Mungo got a few extra days with his hottie. Cool beans. I still can't wait to hear all about the trip.  Eddie sounds like he is just loving big K.   Well, I gotta run. Time to stand on my head in the front yard and sing God Bless America really loud.  ST

      ST remembers some bad trips... he he he...  L is now in AK with her mom after they went to the airport 5 different times trying to get up there for the past 5 days. Not normally a huge deal, right... wrong. Trying to get a 3 year old to cooperate for packing/unpacking/packing is a hastle. Then she gets excited and ends up back in her house. Add in the fact that the airport is 40 miles away and just in general a pain in the ass, that adds to it.  Is Hillary still leaving from Orlando? If she is, she should reconsider leaving from Panama City.  Speaking of bad flights, that reminds me what my mom had to go through on 11SEP01... She was somewhere near TN when her airplane was told to land. She landed (well the plane landed anyway) then tried for 3 hours to get a rental car. Eventually she got it and drove back to Houston. This is not a short drive, and it was my mom by herself. I have no problems driving by myself, but I almost always have "something" with me when I am on the road. Needless to say, she made it home without any further incidents and I was, at that time, waiting to vector aircraft to start shooting down civilian planes. Damn, I can't believe that has been over 2 years ago.  I really don't know where I was going with this blog....

      Hillary is still here.  There has been insane weather in the pacific NW and no air planes were flying through.  Enormous delays.    On one hand I'm happy I get to spend more time with her, but on the other hand I feel real bad for her too.  She's had terrible traveling experiances since she left AlAskA three weeks ago.  We're about to roll out to do laundry.  I'll talk to you badass gamer's later.  Mungo

      Vice city is one of the best games I have ever played. This is because you can do soooo much with it and listen to cool music while you do it.  Email what is going on with your bro. Bummer from what it sounds like.  I went to work all this week already... it was not fun. Last night I did base patrol. Volunteer thing that you basically make sure the drunks are not starting to much shit on the base. I ended up on the bus for 2 hours riding around and babysitting. No real good events as far as that goes.  Saw quite a few cute chicks though. One was a definate hottie until she started talking. Then she was strait up thuggish. Ahh, well, I would still do her. She is friends with people in my squadron, so the hook up is halfway there.  As far as Bubbles goes... I don't know. I just hope that he is doing alright with everything else.... job... marriage... kid... that kinda stuff.  The DTV thing for your car is wild. though I would probably find this very distracting. I have enough problems paying attention when I am driving drunk, I don't need to be watching a football game at the same time while drunk and driving. Just kidding, the last time I drove drunk was when I was 17.... and that pretty much solved that issue of doing that again.  Peace....

      I bought a new game pad for my computer today since my old one (over 5 years old) doesn't work anymore. My new one is the bombdiggity! I can now play Vice much better than before...woo hoo.  I just talked to my Mom and she was telling me how my brother is causing her grief right now. I don't want to talk about it here but I hope it gets better.  Not too much going on here. The weather is really nice with temps in the mid 60's! Beck and I might go to Utah the weekend of Jan 19 to see family. If we take the Foci Power then the gas is free and we can stay with someone as well. Overall it could be a really cheap getaway.  Okay fools, am I going to be the only one to blog today? Just wondering. I think I am going to play some Vice after I get on Yahoo and see if you great guys are on.  ST

      The cussing thing is going pretty well. I only slip every now and then and that is mostly at work...go figure.  Sharing internet is illegal? HA! I can understand why they do that though. Every dorm would be one big network. Heck, if I lived in the dorms it would be one big wireless network and everyone could just pitch in for it. Knowing my luck though I would get busted for it. Oh well.  At least it is Thurs (here). One more day until the weekend. I hate that first week back from a long vacation because it seems like I am lost for the first few days. Okay fine, I am lost all the time.  I can't wait until Mungo writes all about the Hillary visit. I have missed his creativity on here as well. Mungo...We love you!  007 and no freaking internet. I wonder what happen to his finances to make him resort to getting rid of the wonderful weird web? I guess it is best not to discuss it on here.  I am actually starting to play GTA Vice more. Well, when I have the time. It is kind of fun although VERY violent. Oh well, I look at it like a rated R movie but I get to control the main character.  Yesterday, Chris was in town and we all went out to dinner. Aimee couldn't come down since he was just here for the CES convention.  Speaking of CES (Consumer Electronics Show...biggest convention in Vegas) I saw some cool crap. They are coming out with Direct TV for your car and it will have high speed internet, up to 10 phone lines, pay per view and all that jazz. I can only imagine how much that will be when it comes out in the next two months!  I am off to mess around for awhile. Later.  ST

      I am now set up with a wireless card attatched to the back of my desktop. This is because "they" say that sharing an internet connection is "illegal." This is complete bullshit but the UCI is coming up for the base and I dont want to lose a fucking stripe for an obvious thing... thats why I got the Wireless... so you can not tell by just looking.  This was however a huge ordeal. I fought with the fuckin thing for about 2 hours then finally gave up, changed some shit one last time, shut the computer off and 2 hours later turned it on and it worked... Who knows what the hell I or the computer did to make it work, but it works now so I dont care.  Anyway... other news... O'Reily slammed on A&F about their porno in the catalogs  urlLink http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,105388,00.html   Personally... I think that kicks ass... i love that show.  Also, I had my medical inprocessing today and I am taking Cypro... yes the drug to kill anthrax. I have to "ground test" it to make sure I don't have any allergic reactions... basically I am a big fucking guiney pig.  ST, How is the no cussing thing going? Can you still say "Lick....My Balls??"  its all about the LMB... yup, thats right LMB, baby, L...M...B.  I am outta here

      I had my overnight. This morning I got my allergy shots on the way home and then remembered that I needed to replace the AC filters in the house so I stopped at Home Deposit. While at HD I remembered that I needed to fix the toliet paper holder the upstairs bathroom since someone had ripped one side out of the wall. I also bought a new flapper for the downstairs bathroom since the chain broke on the old one...it was actually a plastic strap and not a metal chain (cheap builders!).  I got everything done. Flapper replaced with one that has a real chain, toilet paper holder now has bolts that can hold 90lbs each (stupid thing is staying on now!), and the filters are replaced. I alway feel good when I get crap done around the house that needs attention.  Now Beck is talking about painting our room! SHOOT ME NOW!  I will have to get to playing Vice some more. The pics from CO came out amazing. There is one sunrise picture that I think could easily be in a gallery....the sky looks like it is on fire. I will get them on the net soon.  Eddie...where are your pics? Huh, fool? Stop eating that McDoggie burger and get on it!  Later guys, ST

      Mungo... I could take that teaser places you don't want to know. And by the way... it is spelt "y'all" 2 sylables you fuckin yank. and y'all all is plural.  ST, once you start getting further in the game, you get to own a mansion, a club, and a strip club... plus some other stuff too.  I took my Korea driving test today and got a 97%. It was basically the same as a US one, but had odd fucking road signs on it. Like "no taking shit in street" sign. not literally, but they have a sign for damn near everything. Way more than the easy signs we have.... although theirs are real easy too and funny.  Got to go to gym in about 2 hours then off to work for a 1700 to 2300 shift.  I am eating Korean McDonalds right now.... tastes a lot like the US. Not much difference at all other than the medium drink is the size of a small and the small is like one of those sips of OJ that they use to sell.  ahh well.... back to eating.  peace out mutha fucka's

      I just noticed that you were the only one to blog yesterday, Eddie! Did you know that?  I was busy being pissed at the Bronco game! Man that sucked big ones. They must have attended the Raiders School Of Football. There were some unhappy people in my house yesterday.  I have been playing around with the flight sim 2004. Cool game. Can you really call it a game? There isn't really an objective except to not crash. Neat to play with none the less. Vice City is fun even though I haven't really played the game yet. I have just been messing around killing people and stealing cars (crashing the cars is more like it).  Tomorrow I have my overnight so I won't be blogging. I will find a way to survive...I hope.  I may blog again later tonight if I have something to say.  Talk to you freaks later.  ST

      I sat around all day today. Watched "Happy Gilmore" and played on the PS2. I was going to do laundry, but everyone does laundry on Sundays. So it will wait until tomorrow.  ST, think of it this way... you saved more than you would have spent on the necklace!!  Mungo, any other road trips planned or are you gonna spent the rest of the time in lower Alabama?  I am tired and it is about bed time.   Later

      I wasn't really sure what to get Beck for her B-day this year. I finally made up my mind on a nice necklace for $200. Then, out of nowhere, an idea popped in to my head. So I went over to the sports store where they sell team jerseys, hats, mugs and some signed stuff. I wanted to see if they had any Broncos stuff. I looked at the helmets hoping not to see one with the Broncos logo on it. Well, I didn't see one...at first. As I was walking away something caught my eye...yep. I was now hoping like mad that it wasn't signed by John Elway. I go into the store and ask who signed it. The lady gets it down and hands it to me...John Elway. I have to look at the price even though I already knew I was buying it since Elway is next to God in this house. Price: $799.  So long story longer... I walked out of the store with an Elway helmet, a 16x20 framed and signed picture of Clinton Portis, a really nice glass case for the helmet, a orange/blue street sign that reads  7 John Elway Dr.  and my wallet $1030.00 lighter. On the plus side, I did get the $140 case for free, the $40 street sign for free and I didn't pay any sales tax on anything for a total savings of about $270.  Needless to say, Beck was quite shocked! She has been wanting a helmet signed by Elway for over 9 years. I think the Portis photo will be worth something someday since he is pretty good.  I am worn out and I am going to play my flight sim for awhile and then hit the sack.  ST floating on cloud 9.

      Hillary and I didn't end up leaving the state.  We stayed.  Last night we shot pool and played pool with several of my friends.  And tonight we're just going out for some food.  I'm going to make some margaritas later.  I've got a kick ass blender.  That's really all that's going on.  Short and sweet.  Oh ya, I wrote Double O a letter and I'm going to send him a box of burned CD's that I don't listen to anymore.    That's all I got!

      I have just finished sorting and saving the 149 pictures that I took in CO. I must say that I took some wow bangers! Yes, yes, the family pics are all the same...family. While in CO I got a few sunrise pictures that are bomb diggity! Also, when we visited the town of Cripple Creek which was a mining town in the 1890's I got some pics of old falling apart houses. I will take these pics and make a series of 3 or 4 sepia houses and frame them in one frame. I will get the pics up on my website in this weekend for you to see.  I am not sure that Beck will wear clown paint but I can guarantee she will flip out over her present! I went a little nuts. I don't want to say here what she got in case she see this. I will post more when she opens them...I am sure to win Husband of the year for 2004.  Later guys,  ST

      So is beck going to wear clown paint tomorrow??  Mungo, You like making your life hard don't you. Probably the most intelligent amoung us and this mother fucker sets his ambitions on being a hobo. Of course he is the most wacked of us as well... maybe that is part of it. Just don't visit smellin of sardines and boones farm.  The title is funny. I like reading the caption on the side of the blog to see what quote you pulled out of the blog too.  Rush guitarist in jail... that is interesting. I like the band, but if he would have pushed one of my partners down the stairs he would have gotten a beating with an ASP.   Anyway peeps, my day is going to be filled with fun and excitement.... I am going to the post office to check mail that is probably not there. Walk a mile up hill both ways in the freezing cold to an empty box. Okay so the freezing cold and up hill parts are an exageration, its actually a nice day out today. Blue skies and sunshine.

      So.  Life after the Air Force?  Funny you should ask.  I've been thinking about that subject a lot lately and only last night did I finally come up with the answer.  Yes, I am going to do my walk across NORTH America, but what then?  I'll tell ya.  I have decided to be a hobo.  Jumpin trains, drinking port, gettin' thrown in the slammer, wear clown make up on my own birthday...all those things!  No time for a job when I'm that busy, you know?  So much to talk about.  So little time.  Hillary and I just got up, we're headed out into town.  I think we will keep going right on through to Virginia.  Who knows?  Mungo

      It was nice to sleep in my own bed last night. It wasn't nice to hear my kid crying at 0700...better than 0500, I guess.  I have to go shopping for Beck's B-day gift today. I would hate to have tomorrow get here and not have her box wrapped in paper.  After the AF? I don't know. TRW (look into the pay, might be worth it), Police, Post Office. get a civilian job where I am at now, or bum. Those are the choices. We shall see.  I have to eat some breakfast now...see you fools later.  ST  PS. Blogger title okay? I can change it if you like.

      Good to hear that you are home safe and had lots o' fun.   From what I understand, that # is busy a lot... but hey, it's free, so what can you expect.  I did absolutely nothing today, or yesterday for that matter. I sat on my ass and played video games. Not real exciting and actually quite a bit dull and boring. I think I may actually get my happy ass to the gym tommorow since it has been about 4 days since I last ran. Laziness factor kicks in with the holidays, but at least I know I will be going 3 times a week again starting next week.  Training sucks ass. It is taking the 4 people ahead of me entirely too long to get there shit done and learn what the fuck they are doing. I don't understand these dudes here. If you had an experienced controller, would you not want to get that person upgraded first then work on the new people out of tech school?? ah, well, fuck em... less work for me.  So ST, have you thought any more about what you are doing after the AF life?  Mungo, same question, and include what you plan on doing after the walk across the US. (you have thought of that, right???)  I, myself, am sticking with my plan of being a popo. I like guns, doughnuts and coffee, so I am half-way there.  I think it is about time for a title change to the blog, however, I have no good inputs at this time. I am sure Mungo can think of something funny for a title.  Later yo's  Eddie

      Yes, I am home. We came home a day early because of the weather forecast. It was supposed to snow everywhere so we bailed early. Trip home was uneventful and there wasn't any snow. There were a few places that had some insane cross winds and the truck sort of changed lanes on it's own. Other than that...great.  I slept through New Years so big whoop. While we were gone Vegas got 2-3 inches of snow! My dog was afraid to go outside! Ha. I wish I was here for that so I could have gotten pictures of my house covered in snow. Oh well.  Although I slept through New Years I did manage to make a resolution. I am not swearing anymore. I just don't like to hear my kid saying sh*t. It doesn't work for me so I am cutting that crap off. I know, I know...."Yeah, right!" Well, I am going to try my hardest. Work will be the worst since I like to tell everyone what I really think. I can do it.  Eddie, I did try calling you about 10 different times. That number was busy. Go figure. Just know that I tried.  On Christmas day Beck and I put all of our gifts in a bin and put them away since we weren't at home. Well, coming home tonight and unpacking was like Christmas all over again since I had forgotten what I got. Here is a list.  -Microsoft wireless mouse with a scroll button that tilts side to side so you can scroll sideways...COOL! -Grand Theft Auto Vice City for PC. -MS Flight Sim 2004 -I river MP3 player (128mb). I can jog with it and it won't skip. Nice if I will only start jogging. -Laser level by Straitline -Tape measure without the tape (uses a form of radar to measure and a laser to sight it in)...ultra freaking cool! -Sweatshirt from Eddie Bauer -All kinds of other little goodies.  Christmas was good. The best part was seeing everyone again.  Well, I must go play with all my goodies. I have only messed with the mouse.  Happy New Year to you guys. I will be on here more now that I am home.  ST stinky feet

      That is why there are always people higher than those dumbasses in the chain. He is just a bitter fucker that needs to get out and probably was beaten up as a child and wants to take that out on you.  Friday night was pretty cool. Kev and I hung out and played pool pretty much all night long. He is showing me some tips and I am actually able to beat him once in a while now.  I can not wait until it warms up a little bit so I can start golfing. I need to take out my frustrations and that helps me the most I think. Knocking the shit out of a little white ball and cursing a blue streak is a type of anger management for me.  I was supposed to work starting this weekend on mid shifts but my supervisor called me and said that I don't have to anymore since I have a higher priority task to do next week. So I got out of the mid shifts.  Not much more going on right now, just sitting here pokin around.  Peace  Skid

      ...and that Master Sergeant is yours, ST.  I'm sorry you're in that situation.  I know how that feels.  My major domo sockets are my sore spot.  So deep.  And I just woke up after 8 hours of sleep.  Not working today, it was a training day and I called my boss five minutes after I was supposed to be at work and told him:   "Sort of silly for me to be there if I don't have to be, isn't it?"   He said:   "Ya, kinda.  Do what you have to do, Erik."   So I did what I had to do and went right back to sleep.  Not a bad way to go into the weekend, is it?    The bad part is that I'm in TONS of pain right now because I do not have any narcotics raging through my veins. No 800 Motrin, no Advil.  Nadda.  No-Sing.  There is a techno-beat raving on both sides of my lower jaw.  But so far it's a legal rave.  I'm waiting for Tim to come over with my food so I can eat...and then take my drugs.   In other news:   I've been talking to Hillary a lot lately, more than normal.   More other news:   I replaced the light in my bathroom with a green light.  It is very very sci-fi.   Also in other news:   I just saw a Loggerhead Shrike.  They're endangered you know.  And they're meat eating birds that have no talons.  Maybe they should think about changing their diet.  It's nickname is "The Butcher Bird."  It kills it's prey (small mice, baby birds) by impaling them on barbed wire or thorn bushes.  That's how you know if they live near by...if you see little dead animals in the Hawthornes.  Pretty cool stuffs, huh?  And now, for a breaking news story: This just in, the English language has been around since 1066.  I-Witness Mungo News will continue to bring you up to date on all developments of this fast-breaking story.   CURRENT STATUS WITH  HIGHWAY 9-THE REVERSE UNDERTOW :   Lately I have been struggling with my second book.  I have a lot of road still to go and trying to write about events that took place in 1997 and early 1998 is very very hard.  Memory isn't all that it's cracked up to be.  Tend to forget things.  (Perhaps I should look into alternate forms of memory.  Johnny mnemonic-style.)  Anywho, I've had many quick questions that I have asked many of the people that were around me during that time of my life.  Okay, so it's a quite a few questions, but they're all related.  Questions like, "Do you know when the fall Baptist youth "conference" was held in Manchester?"   "Was it in 1997?"   "I think it was.  And if so, do you know what month it was?" "And if so, do you remember the exact dates of the weekend?"  "And if so, that means you probably still have a program with events and whatnot."   "And if you do, would it be possible for you to send that to me?"  "Also, when is the Dayton Oaks winter camp usually held?"   "And if you don't know, do you have any phone numbers to Dayton Oaks?"  "And while we're at it, why don't you all just write the book for me because I've basically forgotten everything."    The book is 7 chapters long.  They are:   1. October, 2. November, 3. December, 4. January, 5. February, 6. March , and ....and.... I forgot what the last chapter was called.  Oh yah!  It's called  7. April .  Anyway .  I need to know in which chapters to include these events.  So I'm asking everyone.  (I'd ask you guys, but you didn't  really  know who I was then.  I mean, you only knew me from what you saw on movies and my interviews on Larry King.)  (I haven't asked Sara Jean either.  I would ask Sara, but I'd get a reply back from her faster if I drove to Dubuque and found her new apartment.  She's so busy I never hear from her and she's never home when I call anymore.)  Okay, so my reason for going into all this crap is that a few days ago I realized that I had, sort of, smashed into a wall.  I knew that I was about to lose it with the book.  I was going to lose my standing, and the story would win, it was about to defeat me.  I was going to quit, guys.  Then, I found a treasure.  An enormous stash.  A body of evidence.  I found photos, journals, school writing, reports, awards, 500 printed e-mails, and all kinds of stuff that fell between all those dates that I was looking for.  I forgot that I had all that stuff.  And the reason I didn't trash it all in 1998 is because I have always planned on writing a book about Jill and I and the things that were going on in my life in 1997 and 1998.  I knew I was going to write it back then and I made a specific point to hold on to everything.  An alternate form of memory:  Journals, photos.  I have been so wickedly excited about this recent find that I have made great strides in the organization of this book.  I have finished the first two chapters and I'm on page 69 right now.  There is so much info around that I will have 49 chapters.  If I keep up this pace of writing, I will have 1715 single spaced note book pages of writing!  And you know what?  My outline is done and I seriously think I'll be moving very close to 2,000 pages when I'm done.  Enough on that.   CURRENT STATUS WITH THE LADIES:   They all still want me.  Tim Timmy came about 30 minutes ago and brought food.  I swallowed two Meperidines.  I'm only supposed to take one, but I needed fast/total relief.  As a catalyst, I swallowed three Exedrin.  The caffeine carries drugs faster through the body.  And that it did, because as I type to you now, I'm starting to get kinda dizzy...like I took a few shots of whiskey.  Awesome.   -->  The following is an e-mail I wrote to Hillary last Saturday when I got really messed up on the pain pills, do not look it directly in the eye:  "i'm writing most of this because i just  "wook up"  from feeling somuch myslllf..  i'm off beat and eaching morning farm chicmk mostly valid around my mole holes in my jaw.  I think i slept deep in  sleep.  i  tried reading you but  both of them got fuz.  i know my spelling is wrong but i can tconcentrass.  and i feel like i trhow up on something spining.  the grogy doesn' goes away but had have.  i trid so smoke cigaretts and okay. maybe again not so i can wait besdides it makes my stomach hurt too much.  i nkow my smep i know my spelling is wrong so bad.  i trid to write with my book on note book paper  about itheyire in the kitchen talking and its dark and i wrote with my new new pen and i cant keep ioooooo it on the pgae.  i had a dream i ate stress.. aahhhh;lkjds;lkjsaflkj;adflkjdsadsakfl i had a dream i ate trees for salads. and i went  back in side and talkkeed to my new pass my new bosso.  who  wanted me on a 108 or 816 or something.  form for my training reqs.  my tummy hurts.  i don't want no more pilss, i don't like them.  i tried caling you to tell but i cant put the numers ins. right.  fimgers my fingsers feel soo too heaviye.  my finnd si my skinn feels heavy tooo and everything else tooo.   hissary, lll,,, i want you here    so many can you magane to call me again in a row missed the letters becasue the both them got fuzzy. and this is too can.

      Actually, today was a good day. Only the last 20min of my work day sucked. Beck is having her gall bladder taken out tomorrow morning. I was told that I should take leave so I could take her to the hospital and take care of her for the day. At first this didn't phase me. I filled out the form and got a leave number, etc. Then, the more I thought about it the more I didn't like that idea so much. Why should I have to take leave for what amounts to a military appointment. I asked my sup. and the big sup. and they agreed. Cool, I wouldn't have to take leave.  Well, this one MSgt said that I should take leave. He got all worked up saying that it could be abused and people have lied about that stuff in the past just to get a day off. I just looked at him and was trying not to tell him to fuck himself. My sup told the ass that he shouldn't penalize the rest of us because of what someone else did. I said that I had to take her to and from the hospital since she won't be able to drive. Ass asked why she couldn't have someone else take her to the hospital! I just told him that I would take leave and I walked out. I won't have to take leave but I didn't want to sit there and put up with that shit.  This is the same dolt that I wrote about beofre who went off on me about silly crap and another MSgt had to calm him down that tell him that I never did anything wrong. Thank God this ding dong licking fool is PCSing in May.  I am better now. Bye.  ST

      I don't think so.... I tested yesterday. I don't think it went very well. It took me 25 minutes to complete the PFE part and 30 min to complete the SKT portion. No, I am not joking, I actually timed it. I felt like I knew about 25% of the PFE and 50% of the SKT. Who knows, maybe I guessed real well.  I was offered a slot at AWIDS again. (advanced weapons school) If I take it, I will PCS from here then be TDY enroute to Nellis for 5 months then go back to Hill for the last 7 of my AF life. There is no service commitment because the class is 3 days short of needing one. I doubt that I will do it though, I am not really seeing the point.  "I am an AWIDS grad" "Thats nice... what do you do now?" "I'm a cop" "So why should I care that you are an AWIDS grad" "I dunno"  So there you have it...  Mungo, I am glad to hear that you are doing better. You said you have the deepest sockets....  Peace

      Ezuag  Okay.  That was the last dental exam I should have to go through for a long time.  Two days ago they packed my lower sockets with gauze soaked in Clove Seed Oil Extract.  It had a STRONG nasty bitter taste that never really went away, but it numbed my sockets and made everything feel better.  Today they pulled them out and I saw just how LONG they were.  Each strip she pulled out was as long as my middle finger and as wide as a pencil.  I have the deepest sockets they have EVER seen.  They said the word, even the doc.  EVER.  Good news though, they said that I never did develope dry sockets or anything and the tissue through all four of the sockets is healed.  It will now just take time for the sockets to start closing themselves up and that can take many years.  If you got a problem, Yo, I'll solve it.

       For Sale: '02 Nissan Maxima, 14,700mi, loaded with 6 disc indash changer. Moonroof, rear spoiler. 255hp with a 6spd tranny. This car hauls ass! Asking $17,300 but will bend over and take it in the ass for only $16,000! What a steal for you and a sore ass for me! Come on and get a great car and a good fuck all for only $16k!!!!   Yeah, we want to get rid of the car. With the new models out I am not sure if we will get the 18k that we want so I will just cut my losses and get rid of it for what we owe.  Once the car is gone there is a good probability that we might buy a 4-wheeler...maybe two but probably just one....for now. I can't see spending $11,000-$12,000 for two four-wheelers right now. One will fit in the back of the truck just right and would be a kick on camping trips. We shall see. First thing is first...Mike minus maxima = wheeler.  I hope the Mungo machine gets better. You will be happy as pie that you had it done....probably later rather than sooner but you WILL be happy. Good luck and be careful with the meds.  Eddie, if living off base will save you that much cash then go for it. Kev would make a killer roomie.  See ya.  ST

      Over night, my pain killers wore off.  Over night, the pain got bad.  I have only been awake for 15 minutes.  I ate a pill and I am sitting still waiting for it to take affect.  My ears hurt.  Feel like there are holes boared between them.  And yes, my head still sounds hollow when I val salva.  My brain has fallen out...I never knew that could so fucking painful.

      Well the hollowness could be from other reasons. It is nice to see that this blog was not nearly as fucked up as the last one was from you. And by the way... BSed... BullShitted.... I am sure if you were not chasing the dragon you would have caught that.  The trailer that ST described fuckin rocks... I am trying to convince him to buy it. However, this would involve getting an even bigger truck. Not that he would probably even mind that.  I had a very boring day at work today. I sat on scope for 6 hours and watched for about 4 of it. The other 2 hours, I teched for someone instead of controlling because I was bored.  I may be moving off base with Kev. If I do this, I will clear an additional $600 or so a month, which means even more bills payed off quicker. Definate benifit. We will see how things pan out though.  Lates

      If I take my medicine, my mouth will stop hurting.  I haven't taken any in 14 hours.  And my mouth is fucking killing me.  But then again, I want to drive.  I can't drive if I take meds.  But will I enjoy anything if I drive there in pain?  Also, I have a huge spot on my lip where the meat below the skin is exposed. I don't know how that happened, bu it look like a piece of white plastic has been afixed to my lip.  Also, my sinus' are VERY jacked up right now.  I  woke up last night an my  head sounded hollow.  My ballance is off and it's still hard to concentrate.  If this doesn't get better by tomorrow, I'm definately going to the doc.  It is a very scary feeling in my head.  IT's not just balance and concsentration...you know how when you rub a balloon...that hollow sound?  That's the sound I hear in my head, and feel inside my ears, when ever I breath in deep.  And it all hurts so bad.  Mungo

      Mungo, I think that you might want to take a little lower dose of pain killers man.  I went to the RV show yesterday with Beck. We left Ashlee at home so we could go in everything. What a fund time! We got to go into all different kinds of RV's and looked at lots of boats.  Edde will be able to vizualize this one. We looked in the 5th wheel that cost $75,000. The layout on it was the coolest EVER! Okay, you know how the bedroom in a 5th is always up front after you go up the little stairs over the truck bed and usually through the bathroom? Well, This one had the stairs that went up to a family room. The family room had a slide out on BOTH sides to make it really wide and there was a nice couch in each slide out. On the front wall was the entertainment center that included a propane fireplace! Man, it was sweeeeet. The family room was totally open and was like a two level with railing seperating the family room from the kitchen where there was a dinnete. Oh yeah, the dinnete was a slide and so was the bedroom. The bedroom was in the back along with the bathroom. Dude, If I win the lottery....  Check out the floorplan here-->  urlLink Woo Hoo!  It is number 3685 FL.  See you guys!  ST

I feel really really weird.  no beer or anything too.  I don't like this feeling at all... Sneeriously, a few minutes ago, I thought I was late to work...at the commisary.  I had had have had it in my head that they were going to do an some initial trainings on me at the commissary with me.  I'm wide awake guys.  I fell funny.  ew  Mungo

      I just woke up after a long night. Kev and I had a few drinks out on the town, then we sat in my room and BSed for a while. We finally went to sleep in the general range of around 0330. It is now 1300.  Mungo, I know your feeling right now about being in a place you don't want to be. However, at least I have a person I do trust to hang with that has been around for the past 7 years and knows the ins and outs of my fucked up life since it began in the AF.  Well Dawgs... time to go get in the shower then go to the commisary.

      ST, Mike, Skid, Gazer, Ed, Edd, and Eddie,  I haven't taken any pain medication now for 10 hours.  I have been asleep.  It hurts so bad right now that my ears are ringing and itching.  Hold on for a few moments, boys, gots ta sip on some mandarin yogurt and eat some pills.  This is my last day on quarters.  Sunday I'm a free man.  I think I'll explore the new Panama Java all day.  I'll take notes with a new pen and a note book.  I might just call someone today, ask them to spring me loose from quarters, jailbreak style see, and take me some place where I can draw pictures with my new felt pen.  I NEED A FELT PEN!  A DAMN MAGIC MARKER!  A FELT PEN, SOMETHING!  Last night I was put in a shitting position.  I went away from here, jumped bail, broke parole, whatever, but I ended up having to walk 3 miles back home because my ride got too fucked up on Yellow Jackets and Bud Light.  I can't wait until I'm out of here, ya'll I was talking to Hillary last night and she asked me what was going on in my head.  It took me a while to figure out that she was talking about everything.  I'm constantly frustrated with my life here.  My friends.  My job.  My apartment is cool, but it's just in the wrong half of the continent.  I hate it all.  I'm ready for a new start and I'm ready for that to start with Hillary and moving away from Florida.  I hope you two guys get to meet her in Sept.  I told you right?  She's going to fly down in time to get up with Double O and I to make the drive back to AK with us.  She was going to do the whole drive from Florida to AlAskA, but she didn't want to intrude on the four of us guys.   Anyway, I just can't wait to be done with all this shit.  And my mouth hurts like a mother fucker.  That tends to put a guy off.  And the cutting smell of my dirty dishes.  By the way, Double O invited Hillary and her friend, Kahlima, over to his house for BBQ.  She did, and they just all had a great time.  You guys will like her, I think.  I'm going draw and write and hope to God the next 8 months go by in the next two days.  Maybe I'll wake up, camping in Montana with my family.  Maybe I'll wake up in Utah camping with my bros.  Maybe I'll wake up in the Yukon, camping with Double O and Hillary.  Maybe I'll wake up some where/any where/else where.

      Just the idea of going to a dining in make me ill. Ill I will be. April 15 will suck. I have to buy all new blues since my ass is fat and I will actually have to figure out what ribbons I need. Luckily it is easy to find exactly the right ribbons and even the order with the online doohicky.  What's worse is that I am overnight on tues then I have to stay again on wed for the dinner. Two overnights in a row sucks the big bo bo.  So, during the week I am usually at my truck, ready to go home at 1440 or so, right? Right. Well, the first 3 fridays in March we have a mandatory function at 1600 right by where I park so I will have to waste time for over an hour! What a waste of 3 friday afternoons that could be spent getting ready for a camping trip or going to Utah or just spanking it! Good grief!  Okay, I am done bitchin.  ST

      Well... I feel fine. No ailments here. I was coughing a bit, but that stopped after I was up for an hour. My immune system gets a workout with the water out of the tap here.  I actually feel the healthiest since basic training right now. I exercise, eat decently and smoke less (most of the time.)  So you are getting the guilt trip about the AF, huh? I get that all the time here. Then I tell them my opinion and they leave me alone for a while.   Mungo's brain is definately an interesting topic. I think that it is firing on all 8 cylinders, however it is hooked to a bad belt at times... just needs to be recalibrated and hooked back up to the alternator.  Have fun with no teeth.

       ...to walk out if they drag you down.   Why do all the career Air Force types try to lay a guilt trip at your feet when you tell them you plan to separate from the military at the end of your enlistment?  It makes me feel like they feel the SIX years I have given to my nation simply isn't enough.  Did you guys know that the civilian secretary of the Air Force has never spent a single day in military service?  Mike, as for my brain falling out of my skull, I want you (and Eddie too!) to know this:  A day in the life in that which is issued in the 'slipping' faculty of Mungo's brain is the rhetorical equivalent of being stuck on stupid.  Though the pleasant taste of my natural mind is often curtailed by the bitter presence of driftless conjectures (or "aimless suppositions" as I call them out to myself), believe me please, brothers, it is far more frustrating to BE me than it is to ENDURE and TOLERATE me.  And it shortens me, I'm afraid, to a great degree.  Time to love you, Mungo

      Everyone seems to need a tune up! I have a tendon in my foot that is very irritated so I either have to walk with crutches or walk only on the ball of my left foot. The walking heel to toe motion jacks it up. I can tell it will heal if I just stay off of it.  Beck is going to have to have knee surgery AND her gall bladder taken out in two seperate operations. Joy.  Amy has a slipped disk in her back and it just went out on her the other day so she is in massive pain but is on the mend slowly.  Mungo's brain is about to fall out of his head. Don't tell anyone but I have always thought that Mungo's brain wasn't firing on all 8 cylinders to begin with. Shhhh.  Good grief! What is happening?  Talk to you foolios later.  ST

      That was disturbing.... In fact, I don't ever want to see that you are searching for that kind of shit again. And to put it on there twice makes it that much worse.  L starts Pre-School in 3 weeks. I am so excited for her!!! She will begin school next Aug/Sep timeframe too. I may have to adjust leave schedule depending on when that is. I want to be there for her first day. Though it sounds like it is early for her to be starting school already. It is possibly just more pre-school. Gotta get more Bogey Dope on that one. Kinda funny how I can make things that have nothing to do with the AF into everyday conversation. Ahhh... gotta love the 1C5D's.  So Mungo, Is it time to do a trade in with this body or just some major engine work??  Eddie

      So, after a tune up on Saturday of my mountain bike, I took it out for a ride today for the first time in a year.  Now, Eddie has been to Panama City, so he knows, but Panama City isn't exactly biker friendly.  That didn't stop me.  I rode on dirt roads beneath powerlines, along highway 98, and across back streets of Callaway, Parker, Springfield, Panama City, and Cedar Grove.  At one point, in the woods, I came to a 3 foot deep cut in the dirt road that would be impossible to ride across.  I had already ridden 5 miles down the soggy road and had no intentions of turning back.  So, regrettabley and very carefully, I threw my mountain bike across the six foot trough of water and lept after it.  It worked!  yeah!  Guys, it was a great feeling.  50 degrees today, overcast, and just a slight breeze.  Great great day to spend riding around.  Just wanted you know that Mungo's biking days are begining again!!  I feel good about that.  Peace and Love, Mungo   Song of the day:  Pantera - "13 Steps to Nowhere"

      Everything that happened today was beyond mundane.  However, I feel compelled to share.  First of all, Tim-Timmy is down to 65 people to wave to.  Joy and Happiness is-a-spreading'.  Alright, last night I left three messages for Hillary.  Double O had accepted a mission from me to play Valentine Day Delivery.  He did not deliver.  Partly the United Postal Service's fault, partly his fault.  Oh well, we talked and that was important.  She sounded good.  After I left the messages, I sat on my bedroom floor with green and blue lights on.  I also had my video camera set in the corner, aimed at my corner, documenting the art of drinking wine and writing in notebooks.  Then the tape expired.  So I went to sleep.  A few hours later, around 3:25 a.m., Hillary called and that's when we had our chat.  That ended around 4:02 a.m.  In about that ballpark exactly.  I woke up with Tim-Timmy standing above me screaming, "Congratulations!  Congratulations!" in a very rough, rowdy voice.  We put on our boots, our hats, and FedEx rain coats, got into his new Dodge Truckthing and drove to the hiking grounds baring the very long name:  Alfred B. Maclay State Garden Trails.  The trails were all orange clay service roads, flanked by power lines, back roads, and the indigenous 'Spruce-Tagged-For-Demolition.'  It was quite the waste of time.  BUT! Before we got there, we were lost in a town called Thomasville, Georgia.  There, we followed signs advertising the existence of "The Big Oak."  Naturally, we investigated.  We found a 322 year old oak tree on the corner of a residential neighbor hood.  On the porches and front lawns of the near by houses were garden hoses and rusty bicycles.  The Big Oak was on steel cable life support, but no cables or nailed-in wooden support beams diminished the wise look of the 80 foot branches stretching out across the grass...only 3 feet off the ground.  On the return trip, we mosied through Tallahassee in search of The Village Inn.  We did not find it.  We ended up in nowhere at all, so we navigated back to I-10 and headed west.  Hunger was the prevalent feeling, the common tie between Tim-Timmy and I so we left the interstate at exit 142 and ate at a pit offering All You Can Eat Ribs.  We ate all we could eat, I fed the piggy back a quarter at the counter and helped myself to a mint from the candy jar.  We listened to The Byrds and Nine Inch Nails on the trip back to Callaway Florida where we both live.  We watched  Zoolander  and  Monty Python's Meaning of Life .  Neither were great and I was edgy.  I asked Tim Timmy where my mint was and he cursed me for implying thievery.  So I broke into his truckthing and found my mint on the passenger side.  I went straight back to his apartment and said, "Explain why I found MY mint in YOUR car, then, if you're so above stealing from me."  He kicked me out of his apartment and I came home.  I ate my mint as I logged onto the Blogger.  Peace and Love, Mungo   Song of the day:  Tom Waits - "Earth Died Screaming"

      I was running around playing with Ashlee. We were playing hide and seek. Okay, so I would go hide and she would sit on the couch then I would seek her. The fun part is that I would sneak up on her and scare the crap out of her. She was just squealing with laughter! Good time.  Beck and I went for a nice long walk this morning to Wal Mart (1 mile each way). Ashlee got to ride in her wagon...talk about the easy life. We watched a hot air balloon try and land across the street in a vacant lot but they were going too fast so they went for the lot across the street from the first one. The chase van made it in time and they landed safely. It was sure cool to see them trying to land it without flipping over. We headed over to the Wally World and got some light shopping out of the way. Ashlee rode a couple of "rocking" rides then we ate at the Micky D's. As we started to head home we stopped at the Starbucks for a couple of beverages. Good time and it took up most of the morning.  Yesterday, we took Ashlee to the park to play on all the fun stuff that kids get to entertain themselves with these days. I took about 57 pictures and actually got a couple of good ones. I think I kept 15 of them. I need to start taking pictures of stuff and not all people. I may go do that in the AM since I am off and Beck has to work.   You would think that Vegas would have some cool stuff to take pictures of. I need to find some of it.  I have been reading books on Photoshop CS so I can learn how to use it...at least a small part of it. This program is coolio.  Maybe when I get enough pictures that I would like to show people I will buy a new domain name and post a gallery of my stuff. The pictures would have to get your guys approval though. Mungo, why don't you share more of your stuff?  Okay, I have made up for my lack of blogging this weekend. So there.  ST

      No blogging action this weekend. Sounds like everyone had a pretty calm one. Kevin and I are fixin to go to lunch at the E-Club. Decent food for decent prices. After that it will probably be yet another long boring day.  I watched 3 movies yesterday.  "The One" "The Wall" and "Catch Me if You Can" . I also did laundry. The dryers suck here so I was up until 3 am or so getting it done.  Lates Peeps

      --Bubs (Homestarrunner.com)  Ya'll.  We were going to go camping this weekend, but it's raining quite a lot.  So tomorrow we're just going to go hiking at the place with a long name.  Today Tim and I walked around down town looking for adventures.  We ran out of things to do in 3 hours.  Panama City rules.  Tim waved at 14 people today.  He only has 86 left before he feels complete.  MUNGO

      Three day weekend and I think i am going to  try  to take it calm and relaxing. We will see how long that lasts.  The barbeque went pretty well yesterday but I punched out after about an hour. Didn't feel like drinkin with them so I had my coke and ate 3 links and 2 burgers and took off.  Photography is a cool career. Plus you are really good at it. I think that is definately a career you should shoot for.  Peace   Song of the day: Loverboy - "Working For The Weekend"

      When you and your Pops start a paper can I contribute picture-ographies? PLEASE!!!!!  I am having fun learning Photoshop CS for messing with photos. Beck's Mom went to get some copies of pics that I gave her since she ran out. The guy took about 10 minutes looking at it and talking with other workers about it. He came back and said that they weren't allowed to duplicate professional copyrighted pictures! HA HA. Hearing that made me feel good.  Three day weekend with nothing to do. Sweet! We aren't going to Utah. Beck is a little under the weather and doesn't want to be in a car for 6 hours. Cool with me.  ST

      So I usually work normal day shifts, but not today.  I had 4v4+2 / 1930 mission with 15's from Eglin.  So they take off 30 minutes late (standard) and get into the airspace.  They get seperation and then I notice something.  I say, "Lt Grimm, are you seeing any...." la la la, use you're imagination.  Long story short, we had to hand the mission over to Eglin after all.  Well, shit.  What is a UCI?

      I didn't figure it would qualify, however, I had to throw it out there. You know, like slapping a chick wit da wee wee. It just sometimes has to be done.  We had a UCI this week and I think the evaluators thought it was an ORI. Anyway, my squadron did well and will probably get an outstanding. We have a party today and we don't find out the results until 24 Feb.  Peace my bro's

      SORRY about the StORRY, I added a new line.  Hopefully that will help.  I just returned from a three hour stay at Coram's.  I ate soup and grilled cheese.  And I ate three cups of coffee and three glasses of water.  I wrote another 9 pages in my book.  It's all one conversation standing in a kitchen.  That stuff is harder to write than I ever expected.  And the real bitch of it is that advancement of plot is not exactly high on my list of things to accomplish any time soon. Who cares.  Lately, I've been asking everyone if they know of or own a copy of a book that is 1,500 pages or longer.  If anyone can help me, I'd love you forever.  The closest I've come so far is 1,463 ( Les Miserables   AND   The Count of Monte Cristo ) but none longer.  Hillary actually found one that was 1,496 ( The Secluded Boy ...about an indian boy in the old west).  If any of you guys can hook a brother up, I'd appriciate it.  By the way, it has to be a fictional or non-fictional SINGLE story.  No compilations or any other kind of cheating, k?  Hokay.  If I can't find one, then I'll have to write one, and on the rate I'm going now it will take me 500 hours to complete the one I'm working on now.  That's a lot of time, dag, yo.

      Wednesday night I'll be home from 7pm on I would love to talk to you and can't wait. we're so monochronic and time rules us here in America. I'm excited to hear about Hillary.Aldiborontophoscophornio and Chrononhotonthologos?  I don't know what they mean, but I think the last one has something to do with words being in order.  After a long bath and a vermouth-Perrier on the rocks, I think I'll go send this out to you I was just wondering  if We could just show up in New Zealand and knock on a door  deprocessing stuff...trying to salvage my only frustration  i have come to some basic conclusions:  brownies always fall apart... COMPETITIVE SCRABBLE PLAYERS get a junker diesel.  a luxury I won't be accorded until May 2005... I just need to find my goddamn phone card...... feel free to call any time.  I'd love to hear from you!    My brain is getting fat and lazy - I haven't thought critically or had any particularly good witticisms in some time.

      I had my eval last night and I am now BQ. I will be CMR after giving a briefing and taking an open book test. It is about Mutha Fuckin time.  I looked at the webpage for college, but I think I am going to go to Weber State in Ogden.   Mungo, the poopie did stump me. I thought about getting creative but had nothing worthwhile to add to that one. OK, so I just thought it was fucked in the head.  ST, Tell Charity and Kirby congrats. I am sure I will see Teegan just before she turns 1. lol  I have to be in work today by 1045. I go home at roughly 1800. This is a long day for us here. Usually after 7 hours we call it quits. This is 7hrs 45 mins. What kind of shit is that? Making us work a long day. he he he.  Dueces

      ST must be taking a very vey long nap.  He last posted like, two days ago!  I've been reading Franz Kafka's "The Trial" lately.  It's very good.  Very strange too.  It was written in 1937, so it's in black and white (sorry, Techocolor didn't start doing books until the sixties) but it's very good if you're interested in reading something.  I should be finished with it today.  I've been looking at www.columbiauniversity.com a lot.  They are nationally acredited and all their courses can be done on-line.  The books are inluded in tuition.  So if you want to take advantage of AF paying 100% tuition assistance, do so now, because it's going away soon.  Peace and Love, Mungo

True, it may leave me in a wisdomless state of mind for the rest of my life, but right now, one of them is sticking out like a chicken wing and I can't open my jaw because it actually hits my lower jaw bone as I open.  I've had a head ache for 6 days straight.  It's raining today, I like it.  I like it a little bit cold, a little bit damp, and a little bit dark.  Peace and Love, Mungo

      Your right... I would have been singing that song really loud just to get a reaction. Just like I do most shit. Its like rubbing a fork over a napkin just to see how you react.  I have been to the Sip 'n' Cue before. I went there when I was TDY to Whetstone with 2 of the airmen there.   Last night was an interesting night. To start it off, one of my buddies over here puts me in a headlock at a bar. I didn't know who it was so I almost broke his wrist with a takedown hold. That was actually kinda funny since the dude is about 4 inches taller than I am and outweighs me by about 100 lbs. I won that one. So later that night, same dude, is rip roarin' drunk and hits me with a chair. It is not like it is one of those collapsable chairs either, the chair weighs about 20 lbs. My back is still a bit sore. He intended to pull back but couldn't because he was fuckin trashed. The chair won that round.  Anyway, fun and exciting times.  Peace my brothers...

      So, Timmy and I went to the Sip 'n' Cue to play pool.  This bar is the biggest hole I've ever been to.  Yes, ever.  I accidentally spilled a beer on the floor with my pool stick.  I went to the bar and asked for a towel and returned to my table, cleaned it up, and brought the towel back to the bar.  Five minutes later, the barmaid (they call her "taz") came by to collect any empty glasses and to empty any ash trays.  On the counter above our table was a serious golden mess that I hadn't seen.  When she saw it I was compelled to explain, "I didn't spill that."  She said, "Oh no, I know that.  It just leaks here."  Other factors making the Sip 'n' Cue a HOLE: 1.  Unpainted drywall 2.  Wooden-barricade door lock 3.  Dirty water left in the mop bucket 4.  Mop bucket left in the middle of the floor 5.  Broken pool trophies scattered about the entire place 6.  Cardboard boxes filled with old game controller lining the walls 7.  The occational soap-flavored pitcher of Bud  There are many others, those are just the ones that come to mind first.  Anyway, guess what song was played on the jukebox three times in the 8 hours I played pool.  Go ahead, guess what song those fiesty rednecks played.  "Courtesy of the Red, White, and Blue" by our very beloved Toby Keith.  I just laughed and laughed and laughed.  I wish you guys could have been there.  Eddie, I can see you singing that song at the top of your lungs...all the while me laughing (all in good clean friendly fun) at you at the top of MY lungs.  That would have been sweet.  But it wasn't sweet, because I was laughing at Eddie at the top of my lungs and nobody saw Eddie anywhere.  I was sort of drawing unfriendly attention to myself.  But I do that anyway.  Everytime a Bon Jovi song comes on the juke, Tim and scream in unison:  "IF YOU DON'T LIKE BON JOVI, YOU'RE IN DENIAL!!!"  I'd love to take you guys to the Sip 'n' Cue.  It's the only bar down here I really like.  Okay fellas, I'm off to watch a movie with Timmy.  We're going to watch Lost in Translation.  I've seen the first twenty minutes twice now, so, hopefully I'll be able to get all the way through it this time w/o being interrupted.

      Lee Greenwood, draft-dodger, wrote a song that is played everywhere:  "Proud to be an American."  I hate him.  I hate that song.  I know nothing about Lee Greenwood except that he dodged the draft.  If, say, Elvis had written that song, I would love it.  Context.  That's what I'm talking about.  Do I put Toby Keith in the same league as Lee Greenwood?  Hell no.  So let me explain what I meant by saying Toby Keith was uneducated in the American Way.  You guys are right:  We dominate, we have hit lists, we decimate our enemies in detail.  And you know what?  That makes me feel good.  I'm not critical of Toby Keith's song because of it's content.  But in it's context.  Now.  If I don't have anything against Toby Keith's past, such as draft dodging or international broadcasts bad-mouthing his country's leader, where does the "wrong" context come in?  You know what?  It's not so much about the commercialism as it is the attitude.  Wrong attitude.  Like I said, I'm happy and sleep well because I don't have to worry about guerilla warfare in the streets.  But we shouldn't glorify our might in song.  The Japanese General in WWII who ordered the attack on Pearl Harbor called us a Sleeping Giant.  That's what we are.  We are THE superpower (well, us and China).  But we don't have to be so damned arrogant about it.  Another song by Andrew W.K. says, "You better get ready to die, you better get ready to kill, because it's time to pay."  He wrote that song for a friend of his that is in the SEALS.  That has now become the SEAL anthem.  In my opinion, it should have stayed with the SEALS, and not have been released to the public.  Why?  Because I don't want a bad image painted over what I respect so much:  THE MILITARY.    As far as flag-flying goes, if I had a yard, one would be flying in it.  I have a mini flag inside my apartment and it stands next to the Air Force Flag.  I will stand at attention during retreat, salute the music, and feel good about it because I am part of a service.  What I do on a daily basis, in the very long run, supports the safety of my country.  And if we have to put a boot in someone's as to do it, so be in.  Boys, a year ago I was passing coordinates for targets and for a week, it was my job to pass DMPIs, or air strikes.  Those are big boots and I'm proud to have had my toes in those boots.  But when I came home, I didn't talk about all the targets we hit or all the people we killed or all the shit we broke.  Because that's not the American Way.  Being boisterous and boastful of our powers and abilities is not what our focus should be.  Our focus should be on the freedoms.  Speech.  Free trade.  Choice of employment.  Unrestricted movement through the states.  Enterprise.  All those things that not all other countries in the world have.  That is what the American Way is to me.  In short:  There is a time and place for everything, and though this is the time for putting a boot in someone's ass, the place for it's celebration is not on the radio.  It's on the USO tour (which I think is great), it's up in those caves, it's out in those horrible deserts, that's it.  Back in the US, pride for our troops needs to be in place when it's meaningful.  Back in the US, our liberties need to be cherished, shared, and exercised.   "The statue of liberty is shaking her fist"   The Statue of liberty faces east to welcome other nations, not to fight them.  The fighting is done by Mount Rushmore...and that's a huge difference.  In short (again):  Toby Keith could have used more caution in his word choices, and the end result is a song that misrepresents the meaning of the Red, White, and Blue.  That's all I have to say.  Thank you all for your candor.  Peace and Love, Mungo   PS--Eddie, by the way, that girl's name is spelled A-A-N-D-R-E-A.  That's three a's, not two! PPS--My mission cnx'd due to sea states.

      Ok.. apparently I made something erupt today.... so here is my side...  Patriotism has fallen and we all agree on that. Patriotism is like the economy, it ebbs and wanes, and history proves that. Has it dropped this much this fast, I don't know, I didn't live back then. We all have the same idea about patriotism though, and this is good news.  I will probably go on many tangents on this rant, however, stay with me if you can.  So what if we put a boot in someones ass. Tell me this, if someone did something to your sister (since we all have little sisters) tell me you would not want to kick the shit out of someone. Well, I see it this way, we can beet up a person and get away with it (most of the time) without going to jail. Countries do this on a larger scale. It is called war. War means death and that is like punching them on a large scale. We are not cavemen fighting with sticks and stones. We are barbaric in a way today, but we have more than just sticks and stones.   Reference back to being the only superpower. Everyone wants to kick our ass, but they can't unless they get a coalition of most of the countries in the world to work together. We have more assets on  one  base than the majority do in a country. Obviously there are countries that have a plethera of assets, but we kick the shit out of them when it comes to technology. Look at our retarded brethren to the north. You know most of them would rather we not be here but work side by side with us on a daily basis because we are there only defense. WE ARE A HUGE TARGET.  I would have loved to see the Dicks in Chicks say some shit like that in Texas. They would have straight been booed off the stage and the stadium would have been empty except for those 3 dudes that think since no one is there they have a chance with them. Another one of my opinions and I honestly believe this to be true... The south has more patriotism than the north does. Why do I believe this? Because I have lived in both areas. If they had said this in Washington state, they probably would have gotten the same reaction that they did in England. My opinion only, but yankees are fucked up that way...he he. We do have freedom of speach, this I know, but they learned the hard way that some shit should not be said. Good.  Profit for patriotism... hmmm... okay, so people made money from the twin towers/pentagon attack. Big deal! We are a nation that allows this and it is what our military fights for and dies for. I wish that people could hang on to something that only happens after a tragedy such as 9/11. However, they don't. I see nothing wrong with buying a flag to hang outside (when done properly) to show just a GLIMPSE of something that I hold dear to my heart everyday. If that is what it takes to get people to show there patriotism, so be it. Do I like it? Hell NO! Will we have to put up with it? Yes, because the US gives us that freedom.  Now for the Toby part... let me pull a quote from CBS:   "He wrote it to play for troops on USO tours – something he often volunteers to do. He never intended to release the song on a CD, but then, he played it for Pentagon brass in Washington.   “He [the Marine Corp commandant] said, 'You have to release it. You can serve your country in other ways besides suiting up in combat.' We will go kick their butts. But we survive on morale,” says Keith. “I mean, we live on the morale. That's what we travel on. And, he said I highly recommend you put that song out.”    He did it for the troops, that is why he released the song. This song could not have spread by just USO tours, which, by the way, he still does today.  On another note, if you really believe that the US does not have hit lists, you are either blind or naive. I am going with the blind on this part, because I don't want to call you naive. There are people that we don't want here and we would not have elite forces trained the way they are if we were not prepared to do something about it. I agree with ST on the kill 'em all, let God sort 'em out day. Freedom is not free.  My image of the US is a land where we are given more privilages than any other place on earth.  Prosperity is part of that and patriotic type sales are part of that. Though I will never see that in a monetary sense, I see it other ways, my daughter, my family, my friends.  Retreat is playing right now... kinda ironic...  Y'all are my bro's. Dueces.

      Okay. I can see your side...sort of. I do think it is a bit close minded though. The reason that I think it is close minded is that I don't really think that you put yourself in his shoes.  Hold on. Let me back up and give some background here about what I think. I too think it is a bit ridiculous that it took something like 9/11 to bring back patriotism the way it was back in the World Wars. I don't really know if I like the way this country is going (from a moral stand point). I don't like what I see on TV anymore (Janet sound familiar?). You can see that most of the flags on cars are gone now or they are so ragged that I am discusted to see it there flapping pathetically in the wind. For the record...the flag that is flying at my home is still there. It is there 24 hours a day. It will ALWAYS be there UNTIL THE DAY THAT I DIE.  Step back a second and think about where Toby is coming from. The first couple of lines in that song are a true story. His Dad did serve in the army and he did fly a flag in the yard. His Dad also lost that eye. I see that Toby grew up a VERY patriotic American from day one and NOT because of 9/11. Don't get angry yet...listen. Are you angry and pissed off at the thousands of artists (painters or otherwise) that were inspired by the events of 9/11 because they painted patriotic paintings? Are the authors who wrote all the books about America because they too were inspired by those dreadful attacks sell outs? I think that Toby Keith was a patriotic American before the attacks and was inspired by what happend. He just happened to be a popular country singer and his song took off. I feel it came from his heart. We don't know how much he donates to charity or other causes. I bet he does a lot of good with that money he makes.  Looking back at history I am 100% sure you can find that with EVERY major historical event there were songs, paintings, books, etc that came from those events. Ummm....do you know a little diddy called the Star Spangled Banner? Am I comparing a Toby Keith song to the national anthem? No. Merely making the point that people are inspired by world events and often express that through theit art.  I feel that the attacks were a sucker punch. A sucker punch is merely a cowardly way of attacking someone that you don't want (or aren't able) to face one on one. Pearl Harbor was a sucker punch as well.  The United States warned Afganastan what was going to happen if they did not give up Bin Laden. Hey, we warned ya! Back in WWII we also told Japan that if they did not surrender we would unleash weapons like the earth had never seen. We did. This leads me to putting a boot in someone's ass.  Historically from what I have gathered and learned. Everytime someone has attacked the United States we have come back and overwhelmed our opponents with force. We have historically dominated the battlefield. I beleive that is the reason we are the only surviving super power in the world. Are we bullies? It can be seen that way if you want to SEE it that way. Or you can choose to see it another way that I can sum up with one simple example.  This past Dec when that terrible earthquake hit Iran (a member of the axis of evil) I was listening to a radio show. The guy on this show was going off about how Americans don't care about anything unless it happens in their own back yard. He was steamed that America was ignoring this catasrophe. Now, I have no proof at all but I would be willing to bet that the United States of America gave more money, humanitarian aid and sent more people to Iran than ANY OTHER FUCKING COUNTRY IN THE WORLD! The guy on the radio can go fuck himself right in the ass. Have you ever noticed that all these nations say how bad we are while taking the money and aid we give them?   Yes, America makes mistakes. ALL countries do. ALL. We just have a bigger target becasue we are the most powerful.  Back to the discussion. America has alway's put the perverbial boot in the ass when we have had to defend ourselves. As it should be. I for one would be proud to stand up and shoot the bird to any country that dares to attack us. Death wishes (I think you mean death warrants. If not correct me). When the Taliban helped Bin Laden they signed their own death warrants. They flew planes into our buildings. Their is proof the Taliban helped Al Quedisdrliaufa or however you spell it.  Mungo, in any battle you are going to want your side to win, you know that. That is just human nature. Yes, I got excited as hell when those missles were shot in to the caves and those caves collapsed. Run and hide like the rats you are and we will hunt you down. That has been going on since the beginning of time. Now, if you ask most people I am sure they will state that the loss of human life is never good but sometimes when other avenues have failed or you just have no choice. The Taliban weren't coming to the table to negotiate unless they could bring their own jet.  One other thing to point out. If you look at what the 4th of July really is down at it's core...it kind of is a kill everyone day. We claimed our independence from England. They sent Armies over and we killed them all. They sent more and we killed them too. They finally figured that we had killed enough of their people so they left us alone. I think that Toby was just taking artistic liberites with the way the bombs expoded.  There is a song about "bombs bursting in air" that we sing at every sporting event in the U.S.  Your comment about Toby being uneducated in the American way. What is the American way? I am not trying to be mean but I do want to know what you think about it. I think the American way is to avoid trouble but if that doesn't work...see my statement about the boot in the ass. I am willing to bet that it would be hard to find a conflict where we haven't tried to settle things by other means first before using force. Look at Iraq as a modern example. The UN gave so many damn resolutions and threats but were never willing to back them up. We backed them up and now the country of Iraq is free from a terrorist named Sadam...who hid in a hole like the Taliban.  The comment about hit lists. I guess you can put it that way. Hell, we are at the top of plenty of people's/nation's lists. Every country has a list of enemies. We have since the first 4th of July. Some enemies become allies (England, Germany, Japan...) and some allies or nations become enemies (Iran, Iraq...). It is the way the world works. Always has and always will. Sad fact, unfortunately.  I honestly think that some nations are jealous as hell of us. One of the youngest nations in the world is the most powerful.  I can just hear their minds going, "Where do they get off?"  Now, I whole hearted believe that the U.S. screws up from time to time. All countries do. But with us being the most powerful we can't blow our nose without it making headlines around the world. And what do we know about headlines? 99.999% of them are only about the negative and NOT the positive. Very sad.  Dixie Chicks. Idiots! Because of what they said? No. They have the right to free speech. But if you are going to disrespect your own country by going to England and complaining then don't expect my support for your next album. That is what got me and most other Americans. Look at all the famous movie stars shooting off their mouths. At least they are doing it here. Take a look at all the supporters of moveon.org. (the website run by famous stars who want Bush out of office). They had an ad on the site of Bush morphing into Hitler. What kind of crap is that? It doesn't matter if you support Bush or not but you can't honestly think that Bush is comparable to Hitler!  Well, the supporters of moveon.org couldn't argue that comparison so they took the ad down. Talk about embarassing to the U.S. Oh yeah, and the people who support moveon.org? Susan Serandon, Moby and many many other famous people. I think that stuff like the Hitler video, which made world news) is much more disgusting than a patriotic song that was not done purely for economic gain (and I think some proceeds went to good causes, no facts about that though).  Mungo, I love you man but you have to admit that you have always been "against" the grain so to speak. I am not saying that you don't have good points, though.  You are a very NON-mainstream type of person when it comes to your personality. I whole heartedly agree with you about the surge of patriotism that has now begun to fade. That sickens me. Although, it woke me up and I now fly a flag 24/7 (with it lit up at night). My patriotism will NOT wan again, EVER. I can promise that my next home will have an American flag flying in the front yard before their is a direct tv dish in the back yard. Hopefully there are many people with my same attitude. I hope that one day Ashlee can say with pride that "My Daddy flew a flag in the yard until the day that he died." as her flag is fluttering in her yard.   I can only hope.   ST  On a quick side note. Kid Rock is a patriotic fool and I like his music for the most part. I saw him wearing an American flag like a poncho with hole cut in the middle for his head during the super bowl and I about fell out of my chair with disgust. I walked down stairs and said in front of about 6 people, (paraphrasing) "That is one of the most disrespectful things that I have ever seen!" Not one person seemed to know why I was saying this. You don't wear an American flag as clothing! Sure enough, amid Janet's headlines the next day, there was an article about how vets were pissed off to no end about ole Kid. I am sure that he was meaning no disrespect but it was bad. To me it was worse than Janet's stupid tit!   DON'T HATE ME.

      Eddie,   First of all, you and I go back several years.  I love you like a brother.  But that Toby Keith song is rancid.  My blood boils every time I hear it.  That song, sung so whole-heartedly, arose from a painfully obvious lack of education in the "American Way."  Toby Keith is an uncultivated American.  He made a lot of money, that's true.  And he wasn't painted like the Dixie Chicks for taking a stand, was he?  No.  He made money.   They  made enemies.  I'm not saying like the Dixie Chicks, I'm saying it's a whole helluva lot easier to jump that economic bandwagon of blatant, blind, thick, patriotism.  And he did just that.   "Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack  A mighty sucker punch came flying in from somewhere in the back"  Yes, what happened was planned and acted upon by the lowest form of human life.   "Sucker punch," is the phrase that that didn't feel right the first time I heard it.  Do you really think we could have stopped it?  No, because we  didn't  stop it.  We had security for a reason and it failed.  Am I saying it's our fault?  No, but it certainly wasn't something that would have been impossible to see coming.  Bad on us, it wasn't a sucker punch.  Although, it will go down in world history as one of the single most despicable events to have ever taken place.   "Soon as we can see clearly through our big black eye,  Man we lit up your world like the forth of July"   How excited do we want to get about killing the bad guys?  Nice reference to our independence Day.  (The 4th of July will now be known as "Kill Everyone In Sight Day.")   "Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list  And the statue of liberty started shaking her fists"  This is not what the Red, White, and Blue stand for.  Not to me, Eddie.  Hit lists?  Assigning so-called Death Wishes?    and the worst line of all:  "Cuz we'll put a boot in your ass  ItÂs the American way"  This is not the image I want the US to have.  This songembarrassess me most because of this line.  I don't understand how anyone can play this song and not think, "What an asshole."    I don't mean to offend you, personally, Eddie.  But the song cheeses me offevery timee I hear it.  I probably haven't done a good job explaining why.  Mostly it rides right along with thedisgustt I had for the sudden onslaught of US Flags all over the cars on the road, in the front yards of houses, on clothing...not that any of those are bad, not on an individual level anyway.  But you KNOW as well as I do, that flags were MARKETED.  MARKETED.  Anything for a buck.  And what's worse, is that it worked.   "Courtesy of the Red, White, and Blue"  is in the very same league as mercantile loyalty.  I'm not trying to play down patriotism as a bad thing.  I love my country.  I'm proud to serve in the Air Force.  I'm proud of what I was able to do in OIF.  And I'll stick up for the US, because, in general, this is the best place to live on the face of the planet.  I'm also not saying that every line in that song is a bad line.  But the way it was produced, and the context inwhich it's used, misrepresent what the United States of America is all about.  But then again, it's just one man's take, and when was permission given to me to disagree with the masses?  Oh ya, July 4th, 1823.    Peace and Love, Mungo   Song of the day:  Well, uh, duh

      Seen what?  My  NUTZ ...  Early in the morning here at Osan and mid-day for the people back in the sane part of the world. I woke up and went outside to have a smoke and saw something that I am not use to seeing that often in the states. A lady was digging through the trash looking for clothing. I say I am not use to seeing this because the bums in the US usually won't dig for shit.  Here is an odd fact on the same subject... Osan has a recycle program. This is not a typical recycle program though. Our recycle program goes something like this.... Throw shit away... Trash taken to dumpster... Dumpster gets emptied and brought to trash area... Trash sorted through by Korean's for paper, plastic, metal, and whatever the hell else. This is why people find there PCS orders when they buy Yaki or chicken-on-a-stick outside the gate.   This place is fucking pathetic sometimes.... these fuckers are cheap as hell and re-use everything. Fuck that. Then again they don't really know what it is like to be from the "Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave"  My Daddy served in the Army, where he lost his right eye, but he flew a flag out in the yard 'til the day that he died.....   Sorry for the Toby inject there, well not really, cause that song still just kicks ass.  So I have yet to get any input back on the coin deallyo... thoughts????  Time to go put a boot in someones ass. It is, ya know, the American way.

      I'm getting a Nat'l Gaurd package together, yes, this much is true.  Whether I submit it or not is still way up in the air...and likely will never come back to the ground.  Even if I do submit the package, it won't be for a few years.  I have other plans.  I'm looking at forestry jobs and other federal jobs.  With us all being vets, those jobs are super easy for us to get.  Jessica Chestnut.  Sure.  I know her and her husband.  Before she got married her name was Busman and people used to call her "Busnut."  People are so fucking hillarious, aren't they.  I used to joke with her a lot.  Everytime she won some sort of quarterly award (which has been often), I used to yell down the hall at her, "You're better than us all!"  I don't honostly know if she felt complemented, insulted, or was just plain annoyed or embarrassed by me.  I saw her just last week at the Sip n Cue.  We chatted for an hour.  My friend, Tim, did their outprocessing.  Oh, hey, something very strange happened to me this morning.   I woke up, got out of bed, took a shower, got dressed in my uniform.... all this before realizing I didn't hit snooze ONCE.  I don't think this has ever happened in my life before.  HOKAY! Going to work.  And I got some RANK chaff saved up for the boys.   Song of the Day:  The Shins - "Sphagnum Esplanade"

      Literally. I am getting ready to head to the airport this afternoon. Ashlee and I are going to see my parents in MN. Beck is having to stay home and work so she will have more time off for our camping this year.  I will be fixing up my parents computer (probably reformatting the hard drive) and setting up a small network with the two computers that they own. I will also be setting up the computer to try and make it as Scott proof as I can. He seems to download a lot of crap that messes up the computer. The fist time I got my Mom to install and run Adaware it found 175 spyware programs on the computer! Holy cow...  I will be making sure that I have my passwords with me so I can get on the net and check up on you guys.  Talk to you freakies guys later.  ST

Lungfish are muddy animals indigenous to parts of the Southern Hemisphere. These creatures live at the seam between two worlds, breathing in gasps at the surface of rivers.

      No I am not talking about Buffalo... though that would probably be more enjoyable reminising about the disaster that they like to call Super Bowls where they got spanked the majority of the time... especially by Dallas.   However, what I am talking about, is paying off bills. I just payed off 2 bills and fixin to pay off another here shortly... maybe even 2 more. I am hoping to only have one possibly 2 left by the time I leave the Big K. The car does not count as a bill since car payments will not go away until just before I get out of the AF.

      Here we is... I am almost positive, after re-evaluating the leave situation, that I  WILL be there in September . My bonus unfortunately comes in after I am half way through the leave.   So here is my plan. I will leave here on roughly the 3rd. I will get to Vegas on roughly the 5th. I will go camping with the bro's for the days that we are doing the thing. After that I head up to Idaho to see L. I stay there for about 8 days, or I pick her up and bring her back. But if I do that that means 2 round trips to ID. That is a lot of mutha fuckin drivin for one dude and a 3.5 year old.  So how we doin? I think this is a good plan, and now it is time to save some $$$.

      The only thing that I haven't kicked is the grease (cut down though). No smoking, drinking and even no cussing.   The cussing thing is much easier than I would have expected, although I do slip up now and then. Damn it!  I could start drinking tons more water since I drink about one glass a day. Bad ST! I only have one 16oz cup of coffee in the morning (mon-fri only). The occasional mocha from Starbucks.  Geez...I need to get drunk.   I resent Mungo the invite. It went to rawseamud@yahoo.com or something like that.  Eddie might decide to take some leave and come visit during Sep. Like I said earlier, I understand if you don't. Also, let me know what is going on with Xmas this year.  Talk to you crazy nuts later.

      Today is the 2nd time we played some 3 on 3/4 on 4 football.  I'm becoming something of a quarterback.  So cool.  After two long discussions with my friend Tim and Hillary this weekend, the three of us have decided to take these next three months to clense our bodies.  No cigarettes, no alcohol, no grease, and at minimum:  light activity of some sort.  AND TONS OF WATER.  Hopefully I'll be able to permanently kick the cigs.  I only smoked three today and I bummed those while at work when I just couldn't handle it anymore.  Wish us luck...would anyone care to join us on our quest of health?  Shoot, it CAN'T hurt you.  A particular note of sadness today:  The gnats have come out.  They will be buzzing until after I leave.   Dems da breaks.  I'm Certain I've Been Here Before, -Mungo

      Sorry bros, it seems that in the last three days yall have blog-a-dided about a dozen times and none from me.  Sorry.  I didn't get the invitation to the new blog.  I'd like to check it out, perhaps Mikey could send the invite again.  EDDIE:  I like the coin idea.  I'll be thinking about getting some ideas together.  I'm no artist either.  ST:  I liked the last 33 minutes of the game.  The first 27 sucked goats' gruff.  Hillary and I are going to read the Iliad together.  Sound wierd?  Maybe.  But we're going to do it because we want to reread it before seeing the new movie, "Troy," that will be coming out later in May, I think.   We haven't read  The Iliad  since it was required reading in 10th grade.   (That last sentance could also be on the list of things you'll never hear a southerner say!)  Alright, I have more to talk about, but I have to be getting back to work.  Then I'm going to the gym with my flight for two hours.  Then I'm going to stay for another hour and a half with my friend Tim.  Then I'm going over to my friend Daryll's house.  He's working on a cover for my book....segway....my book is still in the process of being formatted.  There is a lot more work to be done than I ever expected and I'm not professional...so it's taking me some time.  Never fear, you all will recieve your own personal autographed/lipstick stained copies...it will just be a little while.

      ST is now officially an old man... what makes this even funnier is that it is Apr 1st here. What a bad April fools joke.  Work was not too bad tonight. Got busy for about an hour and then just stayed consistent for a while. After that it got dreadfully slow and I almost fell asleep while watching the scope and Fox news.  No date with Elena tommorow. She said yesterday she would rather wait until the weekend. Cool with me though... kinda... She says she wants to see me, and then ditches on the plans. Oh well. Fuck it. Too add to that, when I talked to her tonight, she made it sound like she did want to go out tommorow, but now I have a tee time and just kinda blew her off.  Kind of an odd thing going on though... I don't think she believes that I am actually working the swing shift. I think she just thinks I am saying it. Then again, I could be wrong. I am not the greatest at reading women, especially if they are involved with me. Man, it would be great if I could just fuck a chick and have no remorse or attatchment to them what-so-ever. However, I am not that much of a dog. Who knows? Maybe after being here for a year will change that. Damn morals.  Aside from that minor mistrust issue, I think everything else is going fine.   MUNGO... How was this person so irresponsible? We have the time and the web space to go into it, so feel free to smoke a bowl and write it up.  Ya know, I think the other thing that may be part of the deal with the chick is that I have been working for the past 10 days straight without a day off with 2 more to go and I am just needing a break. I think the added irritation on my part may be causing my skepticism. Sorry for switching back to that subject, but I was too lazy to use the up arrows or the mouse to put it up a few lines.  Peace out my brethren and have a joyous ST day.

      Fellas, I just got back from the worst 2-day TDY in history.  Exept that I made about $250 on it.  So that's kinda cool...but not really worth the BS I had to go through.  Too long to go into.  We'll just say I was escorting THE MOST IRRESPONSIBLE PERSON I'VE EVER MET IN THE AIR FORCE to a surgery at Keesler....and he didn't get his surgery.  And I got a flat tire along the way.

      So this week is becoming incredibly long. I have not had a day off since the 22d and will not get one until Saturday. This is because of the exercise and then the shift work rolled in after that. Not to mention, this leaves me no time to hang with the chicky. I think we are still planning on dragging our asses out of bed earlier on Thursday to go and have lunch somewhere, but that is about it.  Not a whole hell of a lot going on other than work though. Kind of a boring life right now. At least until this weekend anyway.  ST, have fun on your quadcache.   WHERE THE FUCK IS BUBBLES????   Adios Amigos  Eddie

      That's my name for a new kind of sport that I am playing. Well, I don't know if everyone would say that it is a sport but I get in a good amount of hiking while doing it! Beck, Ashlee and I have been doing this for a few days now and really like it. Good family time and cheap as well.  Okay, okay...what the hell am I talking about? Check here -->  urlLink HERE   I thought that it would be stupid but once I got going with it I found that I like it. It gets us out and we see things that we don't normally see. I can't wait to get on the quads and go hunting. Yes, Quadcache came from me liking to ride and geocaching. Go check the site and you will see what I mean. You can also look up my finds by searching my username.  Later guys. I am overnight tomorrow so I will be on again in a couple of days.  ST

      Beck and I went riding. Fun times. Fun. I got to play with my new GPS. That is a kick in the pants. It recorded everywhere we went and then when I got home I downloaded it all to my compy. Cool stuff.  I hope you feel better soon Mungonator. It's good to hear that you and Hillary smoothed things out and you put some smack down about the girlie games 'cause that just ain't cool!  Didn't Bubbles say that he was back online? Little slut. I hope he is looking into buying a ticket soon before they get uncheap. That is one reason that Eddwardo isn't coming. Ticket was $900 a few months ago and it's now something like $1100. Crazy.  It looks like tomorrow I will just have to go riding again! Man, the things that I have to do sometimes. I guess someone has to!  See you little peckers later.  ST

      Today I wrote more in  Highway 9  with the help of a Mocha Frappe (mofrappy) and a 20 oz hot Orange Spice Tea.  That was good for me.  I get excited by my story.  More and more so the deeper into it I become.  The more I write, the more my brain begins to fire.  Brain activity has been very low lately and it is refreshing to get back into something I enjoy so very much.  The Blue Angels tore it up today.  I might watch them from my private fishing peer tomorrow afternoon.  They're cool.  So cool.  Peace and Love, Mungo   Second song of the day:  Neutral Milk Hotel - "Song Against Sex"

       Bogey Dope Upon Request:   Stupid shit, mostly.  Hillary got drunk and sent a fuzzed up e-mail to me.  It pissed me off.  I didn't call her for 5 days (long time for us) and I didn't answer my phone when she called.  She sent a bunch of e-mails saying she was sorry and that she was being selfish.  We talked two nights ago and straightened things out, but I was very blunt with her and I told her that she made me mad and I won't tolerate girlie games, not now, not ever.  We're square now, things are better between Hillary and I now.  After things were cool, she ambushed me with her mother!  That was unexpected.  It was the first time I talked to her, and I didn't know she was there.  We talked for 30 minutes!  That was strange at first, but then it was okay.  Her mother is very cool.    So that part is covered.... but I'm stuck...  I'm still in this, well, funk.  I don't really understand it.  Mostly I don't care about my life  here , I think and worry about my life  THERE , in the future.  I can think of nothing else most of the time.  My friends!  I have been thinking about you guys and my family and Sara Jean a lot lately.  Very much a lot.  It makes me sad that we've been unable to spend more than a few days with each other over the last .... well, 3 years.  I will be in Iowa this August for a few weeks and I would have to be locked up in jail to not make it to Dubuque to see Sara Jean, and to Osage for the Kershners, and to Milaca to see the Johnsons.  But you fellers know as well as I do that it won't be for more than a few days.  With only two weeks to spend in in that neck of the woods, is doesn't leave me a lot of time to see my whole family and friends.  If I separate from the Air Force this fall (which I'm leaning towards) I'll be moving to AlAskA in September after a visit in Vegas.  It will be a long time before I'm going to be financially stable enough to make it back down to the lower 48.  Maybe a very long time.  I've been wishing there were a way we could work it out between us to spend more time together.    Sometimes I become very unhappy with the direction my life has gone in the last few years.  Especially the last year.  Sometimes I am so unhappy that I can no longer think about anything else...and it takes a long time to shake it.  This is one of those times.  I miss you guys, it would be nice to have you around for all this.  Talking over coffee or beers.    Last night was a great night though.  My Only Floridian Friend, Tim, and I watched some live music (Don's Dixieland Band) at the Java Cafe (Eddie, it's been TOTALLY re-vamped).  We drank coffee and listened to 70 year old men get down on pianos, sax's, base, drums, clarinets, and trombones as if they were 20 years old.  They had so much energy, so much vigor.... then Tim and I walked around downtown Panama City (the Harrison Blocks) and just talked about this and that.  This morning, Saturday, I had a 09:30 mission.  I teched a 2v2 that turned into two 2v2's and the agency that was supposed to release the A/S to me wasn't manned at all today.  So there was A TON of jumping through ATC asses today.  One guy at Jacksonville Missions (JAX) said to me, "Hydra, I need an answer NOW, I'm going down the crapper!"  So, very exciting.  I'm home now, just a few minutes after 11 a.m.  I don't have any money, and I don't have any plans.  Maybe I'll go out to Books - A - Million for a coffee.  I can work on my book some more today.  Thank you, my brothers, for your concern.  I'm mostly stressed out about the future, I have fear when I look there.  That is what I'm dealing with.

      Even though I was working on a Saturday, today was definately a better day. Hectic at times, but much better.  Work went fine... I checked in a shitload of A/C into the AOR and it was pretty steady for about 4 hours.  I came home and took a nap. Kevin called and woke me up. No biggy.. We sorted the shit out from last night, and figured it to be just bad communication between us. We hung out later and shot pool for about 2 hours.  Talked to my girl too. She actually called me last night too to see if I was doing alright. She woke me up. She basically was asking what the fuck happened. I talked for a few minutes and then went back to bed. When I talked to her today I told her what happened. I later found out from Kev that she just glared at him for a bit after I left and was pissed at him all night. Ah well, the life in the Big K. In answer to your question though, we are doing fine. Kinda bummed because she may be leaving soon. Don't know exactly when but it could be as soon as mid to end April. She will let me know before she takes off though. Hopefully she will still be here for my B-Day because I am taking a couple days off for that time. Dudes, this chick is cool as hell. Has a temper from hell sometimes, but hey, I couldn't be with a chick that is nice all the time. It is just not my style. Have you ever been cussed out in Russian? I think I have. I say I think because she rattled some stuff off real fast one time and kinda gave me a mean look. That was a while ago though. At the same time it was a little arousing. he he he...   The shit with the no drinking is because we are in the middle of an exercise and they don't want people hammered coming to work like they usually do over here. I am suprised there are not more incidents here with bad A/C. The part with the buddy system is so that we can keep watch out for eachother and not be stuck by ourselves in a place we didn't intend to get to.   Mungo ... Still waiting on the Bogey Dope. If it is too personnal to post here, send us an e-mail. Either that or have Ned send us an E-mail. We are genuinely concerned.   Bubbles ... Where the hell are you again? We have lost you. I will be mean and say it is probably because of your wife. Doesn't really matter though, she hates us anyway (with probably the exception of Mungo, because he can get along with more people than ST and I can.)   ST ... Why go? You are not staying in and they can not take away a stripe or anything so it will not be bad in the long run. I sure know that I have blown shit off in the past that I have been "Highly encouraged" to go. The post office probably does not have dining outs anyway, so you won't have to deal with that in a couple years. Or you could just suck it up and go and try to have a good time. I have yet to have a bad time at the gatherings for a squadron, but I will usually just get fucked up and do what ever the fuck I want to do or say... This in turn makes it fun for me, and a comedy show for onlookers. However, you have better morals now, so you would probably not do that.  Well y'all, I dont really have much more to add right now.  Later you bunch of honkeys

      Dude, sorry about your crappy ass day. I hate days like that but the one good thing about it is that hopfully the next day will be a little better.  What is up with the no drinking stuff and having to be with 2 people when you go out? I don't know about all this Air Force crap so you have to fill me in.  How are you and your girl doing? Good I hope, but not too good! You deserve to relax and have some fun.     Mungo .  Dude, how are you doing? We have been a little worried about you. What was the dust up between you and Hillary? Give us the dope.    Me? Well, Me is doing pretty good. Still riding alot. I took Yesterday and today off so I can just chill the hell out. Not too shabby. Ashlee and Beck are doing fine so there isn't any news to report on them. I have been "HIGHLY ENCOURAGED" to go the dining in that we are having at work. That will suck to begin with but it won't help matters that it is on Wed, 14Apr. This will cause me to do two over nights in a row. Leave Mon morning and come home on Thur morning. Blows nuts big time.  Okay, I am done bitching and just generally complaining. See ya.  ST out and about.

      So I see that the story board was taken down... No biggy... we kinda let that go to the shitter anyway. Too much odd shit.  Yes 1/3 is great... 1/2 will be better... 31/32 will be better than that and 1 will be the best. The chin is up for the most part and the willy stays covered.  I had a bad day today. First of all, I had a completely shitty mission that got all fucked up. It felt like I was back in tech school and I could not concentrate on what I wanted to say. Then the rest of the day I am pissed off. The 1st Sgt then told me what a great career field I was in. So I told him he didn't know shit about our career field. Yes, I did actually tell him he didn't know shit about it. Then he said they are worse jobs... I said "What? SP's? Name one more." He said EOD. I told him bullshit, they have to volunteer to do that. He comes back with "You have to volunteer for your job too." Yup, he now got me even more spun up with that one. He added "Didn't you volunteer to be a WD?" I said "I didn't say I hated being a WD, and no you don't have to volunteer to do it either. I love controlling A/C, what I said was I hated this career field." He was like "It's not that bad." Once again, Eddie no tact statements... "You don't know a damn thing of what we do and you dont know anything about this career field." He just stood there and shook his head yes. By the way, the shirt is a nice guy, but he ain't no real 1st Sgt. I would not trust him as far as I could throw him. He is a fucking pig. Completely degrades women and think they are just another toy at Wal-mart. I can't stand those fuckers.  So then... I go out with Kev, because he asked me to. We are still in Gen Order 1. No drinking. No biggy really. I tell him that I will go out with him but I am want to go home at 2200. He agrees, so we go out. 2200 rolls around, I look at my watch, and he says "Well, take off if you don't want to stay then." this pissed me off... 2 reasons... We are only supposed to be going out with a minnimum of 2 people... that leaves me waling by myself... 2d reason, he agreed to 2200. So now I am pissed off and just get up, grab my jacket, kiss my girl goodbye, and take the fuck off. I think I kinda upset Elena by this but it was better than staying there and being pissed off. She was sitting there looking at me with the "What the fuck just happened?" look while I was walking out the door.  Fuck this day... I am going to bed  Eddie

      I am a professional Mungo stalker. I will be writing a book about it soon so watch for me pushing it on shows like Opera, The O'reilly Factor, Ellen and even the Arsenio Show! Yes, I will sign copies for all my friends (only $50 per signing).  Stalking the elusive Mungo is not an easy task! Just when you think you have him figured out he throws a curve and crazy shit happes. Stuff like Asian in the woods... Money being born... shit like that man. Crazy, no sense making mo fo. I have learned much during my time of stalking but no one will ever find the REAL Mungo. No one!  Asian in the woods sounds like some messed up chinese food menu item! Just a random thought.

      So, about this   funk   Mungo's in.  That's me, by the way.  Mungo.  I guess I could beat it by embracing it, going on wild hedonistic binges.  Perhaps do an interpretive dance in the dark for the next four years...you know the kind people do when they feel guilty about the choices they make, right?  The kind of dances with impossible music playing in the corners of their ears.  And I see me there, drowning in cold basement corners, feeling the kind of guilt that will only creep back with interest on a monthly bill.   Indeed, seeking the answers, listening out for the false ending: seems to be an infinite endevor.

      Greetings, one and everyone,  As part of the Official Year of Stalking Erik Matthew Kershner, we here at The Hereafter are pleased to bring you the latest in our attempts to get closer closer closer to that velvet and off-the-hook genius affectionately known as Mungo. Various Hereafter staffers have positioned themselves at a number of Mungo's events since the beginning of '99, only to have their attempts thwarted by overly zealous bodyguards (ST, Eddie, and Double O). Our buddy and occasional contributor Ricerick is a little more subtle in his pursuit of that piece of cake: he decided to write a letter to the Solid Mud Forum, where Mungo is  the  contributing editor.  Now, as Ricerick likes to say, "only a thin sheet of 40# white recycled gloss stock separates me from Erik Matthew Kershner"... an obtuse reference, we think.  We're still waiting for EMK's response.  For now, The Hereafter is closed, thanks for listening. Skate Hard, Retards, Ned

      I broke open an egg with $10.  That's what is left inside Mungo's little VISA check card.  Dunno how all that money gets in there, but with only $10, there must be more room.  I kinda like this $10.  I've had him around since 2002.  Kinda like a little puppy that I see almost every day.  I gave away all his little friends, but hopefully more will be born in a week or so.  And so, Mungo mashed play on an extremely expensive jam-box with high-speed dubbing and everyone put thier weight on it.  Song of the day:  Butthole Surfers - "Ah Ha"

      Dear (in no particular order) Mike, Eddie, and Double O-  Very tired Felix.  I've been going to bed every night by 7 p.m. and sleeping until 5 or 6 a.m.  It's a quarter after 8 p.m. and I feel like I'm up way past my bed time.  Thanks for the reassurance, Eddie.  I don't know how I'm going to solve my problems.  Things are gnashing at me; at my neck.  I feel like an Asian in the woods without bug repellent.  I don't care about much these days, and that feeling sucks...and thinking about it makes it worse and worse.  It's like a spiral.  This might sound weak, but I wish there was someone out there to make all my decisions for me sometimes.  Then I could buck up and do what's been laid out for me and there would never be any regret because, hey, I was told to.  But that wouldn't be good, Mungo would be driftwood.  I miss Hillary too.  We've hit some bumpy road (to put it mildly) and even though she's called everyday for the last week, we've only spoken once.  ON THE TELEPHONE!  She wrote an e-mail too.  I know she's struggling with the distance too, and I have been very good in the last eight months about being there for her, but sometimes I want to cut the line and let her go.  BYE!  Self-righteous Buckaroo, Mungo

      Well, the ATSO (Ability To Survive and Operate, for those of us who don't know the real AF) portion has endexed, but the other part is still going on. No biggy... Thank God there is no more chem gear.  My internet connection has been down for the past couple days, so that has made it some long nights. It is back up though and good to go... for now...  Mungo, I hope everything is getting better for you. You always know you can count on any of us to lend an ear as a sounding board.  Well peeps... I need to finish getting ready for work...

        Still feeling kinda busted up.  Thanks Mike, for trying to call.  Hillary and I were "talking things out."  Long story, the first real problems have cropped up between us and it's not a lot of fun.  Sometimes it would be easier if I believed  my future was already decided by fate, then I wouldn't have to worry about making the right or wrong choices.   Sometimes I get really sick of this life.  I want to start over.  Mostly I want to leave Florida, but I want to leave in such a way that I won't be digging my own grave.  Sometimes I wish I was more "adulty" and I was better equipped to handle the big issues in my life.   I'm doing okay, better than last night, but keep me in your happy thoughts/prayers.  Thanks, bros.  Never Been to North Dakota, Mungo  PS:  I learned how to play a new song today.  It's Neutral Milk Hotel's "In the Aeroplane Over the Sea." But that's not my song of the day.

      We have a bunch of family in town so getting on the computer has been a little harder than usual. Sorry about that you little pricks.  I mowed the lawn yesterday in the 93 degree heat. IT'S ONLY MARCH!!!! We had the neighbors over last night along with the family that is visiting. I grilled up some kabobs...man that was some good stuff. We had a grand ole time.  I tried to call Mungo but he didn't answer his el phono.  Eddie getting some commie Russian ass! Dude, I hope she isn't a spy!  Later foolios.

      ST, In answer to your question.... yes.  I got ripped up last night. It all started at work during our "tactics talk." Beer light went on and I pulled out the bottle of Capt Morgans and some coke. Kinda funny that the AF looks down on drinking but encourages it at the same time.  I don't remember a whole lot of last night.

ST asked if I was going to continue to see the chick I went out with on Sunday. I think the answer is a definate yes. I like her, she has a good personality, and she is a hottie. To give an update, just incase anyone missed anything... Her name is Elena, she is Russian, has now got Strawberry hair (used to be blonde) anywhere between brown and gold eyes (mood depending) and is about 5'6" or so. Real sweet girl and I dig her.  No worries though bros... I am not planning on having another X-Mrs. Markin. Just a fun thing with a cool chick.  Later bro's

      How did everyone's St. Pattrick's Day go? Mine was rather uneventful. Did laundry, went to work, then went out and had a few.   Mungo, at 80K there is nothing required for mx other than just your regular check up stuff, however at 90K you need to have Saturn do a lookover on it. Other than that, look at your owners manual. Oh, there is a thing by 85K that you need to have a proper bumper on your vehicle.  Not to much in the life of Eddie here in the Big K. Just the typical shit. We have an exercise starting next week with full chem gear and that should be fun.... not. We only have to play that shit for about 3 days though.  Well, 2 weeks from today ST will be celebrating his B-day... I think this is 30 for him, or it may be 31. I am such a good best friend since I don't fucking remember... I am more leaning towards the 31. Fuck it, he is old.  Peace my bro's....

      ...a stranger has clearer thoughts than those whom are close to you.  ...an outsider knows the right words more than a friend.  But only sometimes.  And I think this may have been one of those times.  I just called to talk to Hillary and her new roommate answered.  She is Julie.  I ended up talking to Julie about my struggles with thoughts of reenlistment.  We talked for over an hour and a half.  That was strange.  I had only spoken to her a few times before, never for more than two minutes.  You might also find it strange then to hear me say that after talking to her, a stranger in my life, I have been left with such a solid good feeling about getting out of The Service.  I won't have much money, but I think I'll be okay.  I think I'll be okay.  led in my sleep, Mungo

      I didn't get the job at Books-A-Million.  They're actually not hiring part time, only full time.  Oh darn.  My life is about to get extremely boring.  I'm going to have to revert to free-fun only.  All my money, all of what's left over, will be going to my car.  I have to drop at LEAST $1,100 PER MONTH to have it paid off by the time I'm out.  Unless someone gives me a 6K loan or if I win the Florida Lottery, I'm stuck on free fun.  That does include mountain biking.  But I'm in Florida, so it'll be more like, bike riding.  There aren't even good stair cases here.  Bummers.  I'm also about to embark in some pretty serious clean living again.  I smoke on and off.  I can't seem to make up my mind.  Like Eddie and Bubbles, I enjoy smoking.  I do.  But I think to myself very often, "How can I smoke so wrecklessly when everyone KNOWS the harms."  So, being poor, perhaps this would be a good time for me to quit.  Smokes are cheap here, yes, but it's a lot of money over time.  I've quit eating fast food (actually, I've quit eating out altogether) and I'm going to quit drinking wine (I drink a lot of wine, don't get so drunk off that) and I'm going to ride my bike to work and around the neighborhood.  Cut down on gasohol.  Wish me luck homies.  Wish a brother luck.  I believe in a thing called LOOOOOOOOVE! Mungo   Song of the day:  The Darkness - "I Believe in a Thing Called Love"

      Mine would probably be pushing NC-17 for foul language, drinking and other not so good things.... but hey, at least I don't do drugs.  Went on a date yesterday. Good times. Went to lunch, hung out, went shot some pool and hung out some more. Not a whole lot to do around here but hang out. Either way, it was a good time.  Also did the DJ thing last night. I was dead frickin tired by the end of the night too. I worked Saturday night from 2330-0530, went to sleep around 0600 and woke up around 1200. I don't think I had enough sleep to go and hang all day, then go and DJ. Still overall, even though I was tired, it was a good day. I have not had many of those while I have been here. Most of them just suck ass.  It is good to see that ST has now gotten back on the blogger since his escapades with his new toys have kept him away for a bit. Welcome back Cotter.  Outie...

      we need to write these so called "EXPERTS" and explain to them that it doesn't matter how many new regulations, taxes, or warning lables; WE LOVE TO SMOKE!!!  It's not movies, music, or tv that get people to smoke, its individuals just deciding that they TOO wanna be as cool as we are.    On another note, EDDIE ROCKS!!    I too was a "TDY" DJ.  I spun a few tunes down in Turkey when i was there.  I really sucked, but it was all a drunk'n blur.  Chris Klatt will be in vegas when we are there??  that would be cool to get him to drive up to AK too.  And I haven't had a chance to call Hill's yet mungo, but she did call on thrusday.  I will be sure to call her tomorrow and assist her in the repairs of her vehicle.  OH and a funny thing happened today on the way up stairs at my home.  As i began to climb the steps to my up stairs bathroom, i noticed a small child had fallen asleep on the 2nd from the bottom step. yes, my kid has inherited my ability to fall asleep anywhere her body comes to rest.  I got the pictures to prove it.    talk to you boys later, gotta work in the morning.  Double O

      So what would it take to get an "X" rating??? A fat ass mo fo smoking?  That is just plain fucking dumb. First of all, I did not start smoking because I saw it in the movies and thought it was cool. I saw my brother do it and tried it myself. That is the real influence, your family and friends. Now this is a generalized statement and I realize that, but for the most part, it is true. Think about it this way from our history. ST doesn't smoke now but occasionally did (cig's... weed and payote does not count right now) when he was around me. Mungo did not smoke until he hung around me. So we all smoked because of my brother I think. he he he...   Anyway, the music I generally tend to play is rock and throw in some hip-hop depending on the mood of the crowd. Goes over pretty well for the most part. This was funny though... A dude requested Erasure... so I played it... the whole crowd (except for this dude) screamed "GAY!!!" and looked at me after they said it. I quickly pointed out the dude that asked for it and you could here the word "quier" said a few times... I found this funny. By the way, the song was  "A Little Respect."   later peeps  Eddie

      Several anti-smoking groups in America are petitioning the ratings bureau to place an R rating on  any  movie that depicts a character smoking!  According to these groups, smoking in the movies encourages kids to smoke; 52% of new smoking among adolescents is due to smoking in the movies, and that children who see large amounts of smoking in movies are three times more likely to smoke than kids who see movies with little smoking.  Ok, so there you have it.  Ive briefly read over their evidence and proposals.  It all seems to be thin at times, vague at others.  51 movies were selected for the "Rated R" list because they featured popular arts among adolescents who were smoking. How were these stars selected? Its always dangerous for adults to think they know what, or who, adolescents like.  I don't necessarily agree with their methods or conclusions, but that's not my point.   Let me note another side of their campiagn...this one is the kicker.  This week, the FDA issued notice that  obesity  is quickly becoming the #1 preventable killer in the USA.  It already outranks  alchohol abuse  and  drug abuse , and at current rates of growth, will out-shine  tobacco use  in a few short years.  The anti-tobacco groups have listed in their perposed bill that all leading causes of death should warrent an R rating.  To include obesity.  That being said, let's suppose these people are right, and smoking in the movies does in fact increase the likelihood of an adolescent eventually smoking, and this fact alone should merit an R rating (usually reserved for sexuality, language and violence).  Fine. Great in fact, I'm not saying it  shouldn't  be a factor.  But let's take every other serious health danger and imagine the world they're asking for...alchohol in the movie? R rating.  Subject matter of suicide? R rating.  Fast Food, candy, potato chips?  Are these all causes of an R rating?  Of course not.  Does an over-weight actor have to fear not being casted because they might inspire some teenager to eat themselves into obesity  Ridiculous isn't it?  If the bill is accepted by the national ratings committee, here is a SHORT list of movies that will garner an R rating:   101 Dalmations Alice in Wonderland An American Tail The Great Mouse Detective Peter Pan Pirates of the Caribbean Snow Dogs Bed Knobs and Broomsticks Gone With The Wind Frosty the Snowman 102 Dalmations Inspector Gadget Galaxy Quest  The list goes on and on and on...  This really doesn't have much of an effect on my life, but I think some people are a little too ate-up.  Thought guys would be interested in this.

      Tomorrow I'm in charge of CC's punishment of an A1C who has violated his "No Drinking" policy....for the fifth time.  You might ask, "How does a guy who is in trouble for domestic violence get caught drinking off duty?"  Oh....a DUI should do it...but also: showing up at bars frequented by several squadron members, random visits by the Flight CC....drinking at the ENLISTED CLUB!  Big dumby.  Anyway.  Eddie- sucks you won't be able to attend our get together.  Sucks the left one.  The sweaty one.  Ah well, hopefully there will be another time.  I don't plan on leaving AlAskA for a long time.  I have good intentions of getting into some Nat'l Forest Service work up there.  Veterans are always sho-ins.  You guys (Mike and Eddie) need to think about a week or two trip to AK.  That'd be badass.  I would love nothing more than one night around the camp fire with the four of us pulsating each other until we can hardly speak.  Chris Klatt will be at Zion in Utah when I'm in Vegas this September.  SWEET!  I might be able to get a chance to see him.  I'm excited about that.  Eddie, what kind of music do you play? Mike, do you have any action pictures of riding yet?  When will we see you on the X-Games jumping through hoops of liquid fire? Bubbles, Has Hillary called you about fixing her headlight?

      Good to see the other bro join in once in a while. It is also good to hear that your getting your shit straight. Question for ya though... Does the wife have a job?  I have talked this over with ST, and I probably will not be taking the mid tour. Here are the reasons why... 1. It is an extreme expense with going to Vegas then driving to Idaho and then back to Vegas, not to mention the time I am in ID I am going to be spending money on doing things with the wee one. 2. well, there really is no #2 because #1 is pretty major.  I may, however, get a chance to go TDY to Nellis and if I do that I will take leave in conjunction and the AF pays for my plane ticket.  I started doing something new tonight. Well it actually started last night, but they asked me to come back. I am now a DJ at a local club. I don't get paid because that would be illegal for US forces in Korea to have a job off base. They do however, occasionally bring me drinks.   Here is how this started...   I went to the club with Kevin and I was just sitting there bored off my ass so I went to the DJ booth and started talking to the DJ. He asked if I wanted to take over for a while and I did. Well, the manager loved it with the music selection and asked me to come in when the other DJ isn't there at the start of the night. I said "OK." She said she would pay me but I explained the situation.   So tonight I go in to fill in for him before he gets there. No biggy, just doing the thing to kill some time and watch chicks dance on a stage. ALL GOOD... So a little after I get there they tell me that the other DJ was fired or quit... couldn't figure out which one because they were confusing the shit out of me. So I was the DJ all night and it went pretty well. Another thing that I found out was that the owner of the club was there last night and he liked what I was playing and came up to me tonight and said "Good job last night, I like music you play."  This will not interfere with work so no biggies there. I told the manager that I work different shifts and she said just come in when I can. They have a bartender that will DJ when I am not there.  Another interesting thing was that there were 2 lesbo's there tonight. Unfortunately they were not "lipstick lesbians." I think they road there Harley Fat Boys in. It was a rather disturbing sight and I could have sworn that was against military policy. I don't think I would have had as much of an issue with that if they were hotties, but what single guy really does?  I don't have to work the AF job tomorrow since I am working on Saturday from 1000-1300 and then again 2330 to 0530. Saturday is going to just suck. The first part of it is for a certifiers course for a new system and the second part is a regular mid-shift which I will be watching my newly purchased 1st season of "Smallville."  I am tired and am going to go veg out on my bed and watch TV and probably pass out.  Spinnin the 45's like there is no tommorow....Eddie

      HEY YOU GUYS!  im back online and looking to score.  LOL     things are good here in the AK.  I took a day off myself because im getting burnt out also.  working almost everyday for the past few months just to get caught up with the bills is paying its price.  but the good thing is that i am almost caught up with everything.  i got about 1000 bucks left on my mortage to get caught up and life will be wonderful.  Im hoping by the end of next month, i will be living the good life.    Im looking forward to the summer really badly.  the snow is beginning to melt and there was alot of it this year.  about 5 feet of it on a rough estimate.    hope everyone is doing well and all the little ones are too.  later bros

      Outside shooting the shitty shit with the neighbor. Wife informs me of smoke on the horizon and building fast. I think to myself,"Self, I didn't realize that there are still indians our here in Nevada using smoke signals! I thought they all went to cell phones by now!"  Since the smoke was more like a block away rather than on the horizon, Ashlee and I walked over with the neighbors to gawk. Flickity flick flick and off we went. Down the street and around the corner was an apartment on fire. And I forgot the marshmallows...dang it. It took awhile for the fire department to show up but when they did the fire was kaput pretty fast.   Two news heliochopters were buzzing around for quite awhile. The news people said there was about $80,000 in damages. Ding a ling lang my ding a long ling long....and the show was over.  On a side note...I didn't ride today. Tomorrow I am going up to base to buy a new service dress since my fat ass won't fit in mine....or I don't think it will (I don't want to try). While up north near the base I will pick up my new rack...I said rack...for the quads. Quad racks!  Slizo on the down low.  ST

      What?  I talked to Heidi tonight for 35 minutes.  I, of course, rushed the phone towards Hillary and spoke to her at length about how strange it was.  I has been nearly four years since our last verbal dialoge.  Yikes.  I had to call for permission to include her in my book.  That was a strange time for us and she was a fairly large part of my life then.  So it was.  Mungo

      A dry snack and wheat germ crackers.  Washed down with Tolamas Merlot.  A wonder set of late night snakens.  Just finished a brief 2 hour phone call with Hillary.  We talked about her day of work and my day of sheer loafing.  I dropped off an application at Books-A-Million and got hit on by two of the girls working there.  I went to Applebee's with a book (Norman Mailer's The Executioner's Song) and ate honey grilled salmon with almond rice pilaf and steamed veggies.  I got hit on by the hostess and the server.  Four girls in one day...not a one of them older than 19.  This never happens.  When I told Hillary about this she laughed.  She said that all day at work people were asking her what she was so happy about.  She didn't know why they would ask.  But let me tell you, the conversation we had last night (warm, reassuring, and sexy) affected the both of us so much that we were both subconsciously showing it.  Somehow, my hormones were flying all around me in atomic whirlwind action.  ahoy hooey husks, Mungo   Song of the day:  Phillip Glass - "Floe"

      Dude I about died when I read the SSgt for sale bit on the side. That was fucking hillarious.  Mungo, do what you gotta do. You know above all else we got your back. I myself find "myself" looking at re-upping. My reasons are completely unselfish reasons though, with the exception of the bonus, which honestly does not mean that much to me. I look at it because I need the med bennifits. If I can get them near as good in the outside world I will definately take that option.  So, I was asked out this weekend for next Friday afternoon. I more than likely will not go because I will probably be working. Anyway, as ST knows, it is a Russian chick. Her name is Elena and she is 30. Blonde hair (which she said she is going to dye tonight), brown eyes and i am guessing around 5'5" to 5'6" (can't really tell, she always has high heals on.)No worries though, I do not plan on making her an American citizen. However, the chick is hot and could be a lot of fun while I am in the Big K.  I am eating chunky soup. It is good. It is bachelor food. This will not change for many years to come, because I do not want to give up my soup. he he he...  Mungo, I am also still trying to figure this pencil battry thing. WTFO?

      I spoke to Hillary last night for six hours.  It's not record, but it's close.  She's amazing!!  The only reason we stopped is because my pencils battery died.  Hers was beeping too.  A few minutes after it went CHAPATTI! She called me back and we said Codington.  Anyways.  I spoke to Hillary last night about reenlisting and I decided not to.  Before I talked to Hillary I talked to Double O.  He asked me what I wanted to do with my life, and then he asked me which was more important, leave the Air Force a poor man and be with Hillary, or stay in the Air Force, maybe get two more assignments, and leave Hillary behind.....  Well.  That's pretty decision making when you look at it like that.  I'm just going to have to budget WICKEDLY to be out of debt by the time I get out.  I'm going to get dressed and clean and swine now.  I'm headed out to Books-A-Million to submit my application.  They have open positions on the floor and in the cafe.  If I can get a part time job, that helps with the penny pinching scheme.    ---- Bigger "mope" squashes and the arid e-railways for you and cognac to the honey-eyed hobo in the thaw of weeding!" cried the bebop statesmen.

      I know that every post is about riding. Sorry about that. It is my obsession right now since they are new but I am sure that it will wear off...eventually. It is just soo much fun....you will see.  Not too much else going on right now. I just ordered a rack that will allow us to take both ATV's to different places to ride. I should get it on Tue. I will have to take some pics and send them.  Mungo, you will have to make your own decision about re-uping. That is a life altering decision that only you know the answer to. Some questions to ask....  -How much $ will you have to spend a month for bills? (Food, car, insurance, gas...) -How much time will you not be working? -How much cash will you spend on vacations and travel? -If you stay in will Hillary move with you? -What do you feel in your heart?  Keep us informed. Good luck.  ST

      I got a hankerin' for the above.  But I can't afford it.  Big thing on my mind, so to speak.  I have $300.  Hype, three of the big ones.  But that's all I have.  Maybe more with spare change.  And if I hope to conquer all my debt before I separate in September, well sirs... I won't have much more than that when I get out.  I'm thinking MAX: $2,000  And that is if I'm disciplined.  Now, being disciplined in a dire time isn't a problem for Mungo.  Not at all.  But the problem is this:  can I afford to get out of the Air Force?  Dunno, really.  Hillary and Double O are in AK and will be there when I plan on moving there in September.  They are both wonderful people who have guaranteed that I won't have to worry about a place to live or food to eat.  And I'm an industrious person, I won't be w/o a job for too long.  But I'll be poor as hell for a long time.  Not that I have a problem with bein poor, I'm kinda poor now...but if I reenlist for 4 years I can pay off my car (and fix the bumper!!!!) and hide the rest of it away as a nest egg for the future.  These are the things on my mind.  Thoughts?  topaz tiger, Mungo   Song of the Day:  Grandaddy - "Yeah is what We Had"

      I have used many of those "ble" words in EPR's that I have written. ST will never know the feeling because he has not had a real AF job in a while and probably never will again. He may have to learn how to write a report on the retarded mail carrier though in the near future. Of course the only place where I have actually seen that was in AK at the PO by the dorms.  This week was hell. I hated this week. I was running around and around trying to find shit for a fucking database and couldn't find half the shit I was looking for. I ended up finding all but one. This one is apparently in a reg that nobody seems to have or know about. It is bad when you call HQ and they tell you that they don't have that reg on file. This leads me to believe that Korea is more fucked up than I thought it was. AHHH well.... FUCK IT!  Mungo... you just need to learn some shit on computers. I don't know a whole lot, but I know enough to get me by. ST is definately the sounding board for all computer questions for the most part. But, I also have Kev here who can fix shit too.  Well gents... I am tired and I need to take a dump.  Dueces.

      BOYS BOYS BOYS!  How have you been, oh my brothers?   Let me explain why I haven't been up wit da blogginz.... My computer is old.  Yes?  Yes.  I am not good with computers.  Yes?  Yes.  And when a problem happens, I don't know how to fix it.  Yes?  Yes.  So I usually send Mike an e-mail and beg his guidance.  Even when he tells me what to do he uses big fancy computer words that he must have learned in college.  Words like "Install" and words like "version"  and "Download."  And he puts them into big sentences like "Reinstall Microsoft Word if it's not working," or sentences like, "Download the latest version of..."  I don't know what he's talking about!  Jeepers.  So, Internet Explorer crumped.  I couldn't use it.  When I tried, a screen opened up and told me something or other did this or that and it asked me if I wanted to "retry."  Over and over this would happen.  Then it started happening even when I wasn't trying to open Internet Explorer.  I figured this was when pop-ups were trying to happen.  So, at first I was happy that I no pop ups were screwing me over.  But then I realized that I couldn't look at porn OR blog.  (Sometimes those are one and the same...oh....Eddie....I love the way you talk dirty...."Fuck em'" indeed....  Anyway.  Jordan Farrell came over to my apartment today and fixed stuff.  He asked me questions I didn't understand and my jumbled incoherent answers somehow made sense to him and he has begun to heal my sick compy.  I love Compy.  That is why I have not blogged in almost 6 days.  It's not because I suck, it's because I let Compy start suckin'.  I will try to be more responsible in the future.  There's  word I don't like:  Responsible.  Or "Reliable"... or "Dependable" or "sensible"... and lots of other words that end in -ble  Codington Homage, Mungo   Song of the Day:   The Postal Service - "We Will Become Silhouettes"

The weather here sucks. It is snowing right now and that blows the biggins. So how did the test go? This year is supposed to have a high promotion rate, but I still doubt I will make it. Personnally I don't give a damn either.   How about the name "Rumbler"?? That sounds like a good name to me. Or you could name it "Crack" since it is your new addiction.  Well I gots to hop in the shower to go to work. Later Peeps.  Eddie

      Well, it is the day before I test for Tech so I have the whole day off! Woo hoo for the day off. Bad news is that it's freaking raining and crappy out. Why is this bad you ask? I wanted to go ride my new toys! I could have had all freaking day to go riding up in the mountains but now I am stuck inside and all I can do is go out in to the garage every 30 minutes and pet them and kiss them and....okay, okay. Maybe I will wash them.  What should I name mine? Beck named her's Zulu. I have a bight yellow four wheeler and I need a name. Come on guys, get creative.  Talk to you guys later.  ST  PS. Why is no one posting any more?

      Mungo, Good to hear that things are going well in the "Small I." I am glad that you are having a good time and having a lot of fun. Be careful when you kick black balls in the middle of the night though... it can be construed as racist... he he he.  So here are my past 2 days... Get ready, but I don't know how much I will actually type. I will try not to leave anything noteworthy out.  Kevin and I rented a car to drive to Seoul on Wednesday (back to Osan) and Incheon Int Airport today.   Yesterday, we took off around 1030 and got to Seoul around 1130. Made it  to  Seoul with no real hitch other than a little confusion with Toll Booth Willy. There was slight confusion on how there tolls operate, but we made it through them fine. However, when we got into Seoul was another issue. The 3,  yes 3 , maps that we had were decent. Not good by any means. Most of the streets were not labeled on the maps, so land marks (which were labeled on the map) were our main guidance. It was purely by chance we found the building that we were looking for because I looked up and saw a street that may (but probably did not) correlate with the subway system we had ridden a few days ago. It somehow worked out. So we get there, and it is lunchtime. This means we have to wait an hour before we can see them. So we go and park the car. I was slightly worried about where we parked the car because it was in a parking lot of a tax center that had a gate that would  possibly  close if they shut down for the day. I don't know if they actually use it or if it just another decoration in "the land of the not quite right." We go have Popeye's chicken for lunch since we are waiting anyway. The calamari on the side of the road was not too appetizing and neither was the something or other-on-a-stick. So Popeye's it was. After lunch, it was back to the office. We filled out forms, turned them in and got yelled at because we tried to use the AK drivers license as a form of ID. Didn't work. Busted out the AF ID and she became beyond polite and was very nice to us. Who fucking knows why that was, but it worked, so no complaints. It is about 1315 at this time. We finally saw them after about a 2 hour wait in a hot, stinky room. We got to see them for roughly 8 minutes. Yup, 8 minutes. This, however, is better than the other people were getting since they were all only getting about 3 minutes. Once again, I think because of the AF shit, but can not confirm. We said our goodbyes and started back on the roadtrip again. This actually became a bit of an adventure, though we had a clue (I think I actually mean WAG) of how to get out. The WAG, I mean clue, was close to right on except for about 2 turns. By this time, it is now about 1600. The start of rush hour. Fuck me, these people are worse than the fuckers in LA, Vegas and Houston combined. Very aggressive driving mode was kicked in. So we made it to the highway and went a few km before the gridlock began to get bad. So, picture this (which part of this was done just because we are from the US and proud of it)... 2 American dudes (very easy to spot) driving (or creeping) down the highway with  "Sweet Home Alabama"  absolutely fucking cranked up with the windows down just chillin in a Hyundai Sonata. We were feeling like we needed to be in a '68 Camero or a late 50's Stingray. We didn't have one of those though, so the Sonata it was. Traffic cleared up after about 20 km of a slow crawl (but not an absolute dead stop, which was a bonus) and we finally made it home around 1800. Yup 8 hours for 8 minutes. If you have not caught on by now, and I know ST has, (he has slightly more bogey dope) it was worth the drive and waiting.  Then there was today... Today SUCKED HUGE DONKEY BALLS, up until just before I started writing this Blog. Here is why. Got up this morning at around 0500. Left the place at around 0610 after I had to wait for Kevin because he overslept and I woke his ass up at about 0540. We also picked up one of the girls mother to bring her along so she could say bye to her kid and their luggage that we had packed last week. She speaks about as much English as I do Russian. Anywho, we are on the road to Incheon AP. Once again Toll Booth Willy was a slight factor. Not as much as prior, but the amounts were all different on the roads. I think I spent about $25 in tolls over the past 2 days. There highways are EXTREMELY well kept though. Smooth as hell and VERY clean, and really nice bridges and tunnels. Couldn't really get good pics though, too much traffic and sidewalls. We get there at around 0800. They said they would be there around 0900 so we wanted to make sure that we didn't get lost on the way to the AP, thus the leaving early. Well, after many phone calls/text messages of mass confusion, they finally get to the AP at around 1100. We are told to wait (more) and they will be able to see us shortly. Then they say 1345. That is changed to " Ohh, sowwy suh, they no see you ." I am now pissed off. Here I am, waiting, waiting and more waiting, to be fucking told that I can't see my chick before she leaves the fucking country.  Not even fucking SEE her!  Not just, no touchy. No, no seeyee either. So, we check in their shit and leave. I wanted to punch something really bad. Elena did, however, call me a few times and send a few text messages before the plane took off. This was while I was driving 130 km/h so needless to say, not much got accomplished on those calls. Oh, I am the only one of us with a license to drive in "The Big K" so there was no option for anyone else to take over. Although a Chinese Fire Drill would have been funny on the highway, but not at that speed. n/m, I am losing track of the story. We get back to Osan with no hitch, just a long disappointing drive and several Toll Booth Willies.  Kev and I went out to eat then went out to have a drink. Yup, I had 2 drinks tonight. Funny thing is, they tasted like shit and I didn't even want the second one but the manager of the bar bought it for me, so I could not be rude and say no. Honestly, I did not want the second one. It did not taste good, nor did it help me in any way. I had a coke after that and that was truly tasting better. I think I have lost the urge to want to drink after those 2.  I get home from the bar and call Elena. She is home safe and sounded really happy. This is a good thing. She is now able to see her kid everyday and I am happy for her. She said she missed me and we talked for about 15 minutes. There really is not a huge difference in price between calling the US and calling Russia, so no worries there. She also had me talk to her mom... That was interesting, I think I caught about 2 words out of that conversation. The term conversation is used loosely on this. I also talked to her daughter. This went slightly better. She is taking English, but was shy so Elena was pimping her on what to say. Then Elena got back on the phone and told me to try in Russian to Juliana (Elena's kid) This went slightly better than the first time, but not great. I know  VERY  limited Ruskie and I am sure the slight southern accent does not help shit. But, I did manage to say a few things (correctly, others were bastardized) and understood EVERYTHING she said. She was saying very simple phrases to me though. I talked to Elena a few more minutes, then we hung up. I will talk to her again probably tomorrow, but the everyday thing is not going to happen. That would get WAY too expensive. I don't like talking on the phone to begin with, as y'all should already know, much less paying to talk on the phone other than a local phone bill. But even then, I hate phone bills too.  OK, so I just hate bills.  After I was done talking to her, I started to blog. I hope y'all found it at least somewhat interesting. Honestly, I hope you found the humor that I tried to put in it too. It is much easier for me to make slight jokes to ease my own tension. Dudes, I miss the chick. I know what you are all thinking too... Yes, I am hung up on her. But, this could be a good thing, it keeps me from fucking anything that walks while I am here. I also realize this could be a bad thing, but right now, I have this true fear of commitment which keeps me in check for the most part.  I am a fucking nutcase. I just wish at least one of y'all could have actually met her. Yeah, well, such is life.  No worries about Eddie though. I am not really down in the dumps because she is happier, which makes me better. I am not going to do anything rash. I just have the life of shitty relationships.   OK, I am done with my soap box and feel much better that I got that off my chest. Later bro's  Paka (bye)  Eddie

      Post.  This is my blog.  Yo.  Yo.  Kick it DJ, spin dat beat. I left Florida Friday night and got to Dubuque, Iowa Saturday night.  I met Sara Jean at The Village Inn on Dodge St. and we drank coffee and had french toast.  It was good.  Then we went to her house, showered up and went to a Salsa House Party.  Salsa as in dancing, not a mexican dip party.  The party was wild and out of control and huge.  So many sexy women with beers in the cleevage.  It was bizarre but I behaved myself like a perfect gentleman because Sara Jean was there.  Later, Sara and I bought bubble guns and shot bubbles all over Dubuque.   We even made a little video with a digital camera.  I had a great time with Sara Jean.  I got to Osage on Monday afternoon and hung out with the family.  Monday night I went for a drive in the country with my brother, Ryan.  I drove out to the house that Jill used to live in...and I spent some time on the one lane bridge.  I told Ryan a little bit about her, but mostly I didn't say anything.  That was good, but I'm going back there tonight, by myself, and I'm going to stay there longer.  Yesterday (Tuesday) Ryan, my pops, and I went to visit my sister, Meghan, in Ames, Iowa.  She's going to school at Iowa State.  She's a cyclone.  We all ate coffee and I bought a black soccor ball and we all went out to a soccor field and played soccor until it had been dark for an hour.  Playing soccor by moon light with a black ball is really hard, especially if your the goalie.  I made my brother be the goalie.  HA HA HA.  Today or tomorrow, I plan on goign to the Spam museum in Ausitn, MN.  My friend Chris Klatt should be coming down tomorrow or so.  I'll be here until Saturday and then I'll be heading back to Florida.  Crappy crappy Florida.  But for now, I'm having a very good time.

      Hey, is the blog title from a long time ago... I think I remember that from something, and not just math class.  So, it is off to Seoul AGAIN today. This time I will be able to see her. ST, I already gave you the bogey dope on the situation. Yes, I really do like this chick. But realistically, there is a slim chance this would advance anywhere even if I did go to Russia to see her in a few months. I do care about her a lot though. Maybe it is because it is something completely different than prior relationships... there tends to be a bit more spice there. I dunno...  Wow... my car has a whole 175 miles on her. Go Calypso... I miss having my car. I am thinking about giving her a new sound system when I get back to make her happy. Something with at least an MP3 player and some new speakers. I dont think I will go to the counter-sinking woofers though. That just gets to be too much.  Well, off to the races...

      Dude, I am sorry to hear about the crappy trip to the big city! I hope the next one goes better for you and you get to spend some time with the chicky.  I think that you care about her much more that you let on or you wouldn't be nearly as upset as you are. It's not bad that you care so much, just sad that is has to work out this way. Sorry about everything dude.  On a bright note. You car now has about 175 miles on it since you left. I might even have to put gas in it within a month! I think I should probably go and get it washed too since it is a little dusty, not bad though.  Okay, I am off to hook up another computer. I bought a switch that will let me use one monitor, keyboard and mouse to control two computers. Pretty neat stuff.  ST out

      Well, Went to Seoul yesterday. Got there after 2.5 hours of mass transit around "The Big K." What happens then? Yup, they are closed to visitors. Needless to say I wanted to punch a fucking wall. Ahh well, I am going to go on Wednesday again. This time I know the hours.  I am at one week with being sober. I am actually able to wake up in the morning and remember everything from the night before and I feel better.  ST, have fun with the Fuzzy.  Eddie

On Wednesday morning I'll be back in Osage.  Chris Klatt will come down from Minneapolis to visit.  We might drive back up for Al's.  It sounds busy, but all those roads in Iowa are as therapeutic for me as a shrink's couch.  Speaking of couch...   Lied des Tages:  Couch - "Alles Auf Pause"

      So, I took the run part of the PT test and ran an 11:17. Total PT score... 88. I almost got an excellent.  Mungo, Good to hear you are going to Dinney World with ST and Family. Should be fun. I wish I could go.  It is not necessarily more serious than what I explained... I don't think. The last few days that we were able to spend together were just a whole lot of fun. And, we did spend a good amount of time around each other. No, it is not just the sex that was fun... but that was too. We just hung around and talked, walked around downtown, and shot a few games of pool. This was also after I decided to stop drinking, so there was no alcohol in me at these times. Elena was definitely shocked that I stopped and surprised that I could go into a bar and not drink. I will get back to the drinking thing here in a sec... I will tell you this though, I REALLY enjoy spending time with her. Am I thinking marriage... um... NO. I don't think that I can dedicate myself to someone that much anymore. The only person I can dedicate myself to is L, and that is for obvious reasons. Damn, I miss my little girl. But Elena is a kick ass chick who is fun to be with.  The drinking thing... I came to a realization that I can not control my drinking over here when I start. So what better way to control it than just not drink. This week has been hell on that account. It was hard to not down the bottle of 151 after packing up Elena's apartment.  So did I answer your question or just create more? Honestly, I just wish y'all would have the opportunity to meet her. I need the ST stamp of approval. Mungo and OO are easy to get an approval from. ST is not. He is more of the asshole like I am when it comes to the bro's chicks. Who knows, maybe someday she will try to fly to the US? Then again, probably not.   Take me to the magic of the moment, On a glory night   I sang that song with her on Kareoke.

I am going to see Elena in Seoul tommorow though I will only be able to see her for a few minutes. Her flight leaves on Thursday. I have the day off, so I am going to go and see her off if " they " let me. I will find that out tommorow. She told me she wants to come back and is going to try. We will see how that goes.  This just sucks ass.  Later Bros.  P.S. Mungo... What is with the double post?

      I feel like shit. I had a slight temp last night. It was 38 deg Celcius which equates to a little over 100 F. My normal temp is 97.8. Yes, less than the normal 98.6, but my body is odd like that. I said C instead of F because Elena took my temp and her thermometer is in C not F.  Tell you what though... there is nothing better than a chick taking care of you when you are sick.   Unfortunately, I still have to go to work. I just got back from the gym doing part of my PT test. The run will be on Friday and I hope I am still vertical at that point. Though I did manage to crank out 56 push-ups and 40 sit-ups even though I feel like complete ass.  Mungo, you know I would be there with you too if I could. Hope they shrink your head good.  Bubbles... where the fuck you at?  ST, remember the tags on my car... you probably would not get pulled over. That was probably why you took my car in the first place. Little extra help with the po-po's. Have fun playing with your fuzzy this weekend. I am just glad that I am not there, otherwise Beck would be telling me to start laying tile or something too.  Well, I am going to take my feeling shitty ass to the shower and then go to work. Later.

      We are getting new fuzzy in the house. The old fuzzy was looking pretty beat up and nasty. This coming weekend will be the weekend of floor fuzzy. I am excited about it except that having to move all the furniture and tear up the old fuzzness is not going to be fun.  We are going to watch angels sing tonight. Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Get to see some angle voices get down and boogie on. I am sure that I will have fun and my brain will be able to absorb some pretty stuff instead of all the crap on the telemobelly these days and nights. Crapola I say! CRAPOLA!  When I walked in to the garage today the Hogs awoke from their slumber and asked, "Super T! Would you like to go for a ride this glorious day?" I responded, "No, Hogs, I can't ride today. Many things on this Super T's plate. Many things in the brains." The Hogs understood and told me to take it easy and not freak the brain out too much. I petted the Hogs and went inside. I do think that I will soon need to ride so they do not feel neglected. Neglected Hogs are not joyous Hogs. And ALL Hogs should be joyous!  My wally is back in my pocket! Yea to the wally.  My voice is telling me that I want a Pepsi. I must now go down to the king of the super coolers and pluck a Pepsi from it's cage. Icy chill Pepsi will spill the bill with a pill so no kill for the frill...  You don't say gay ray by the bay sleeping in hay all day...and so on and so on.  My jello brain is rattling and it feels good to let it spill on the compy viewer. Thoughts flow and visions scamper and keys go tappity tap tap.   Oh yeah....Pepsi!  ST

      I am home from my overnight. Yeah for me. I left my wally in Utah so Beck's sister overnighted it to me. Boy, I felt odd not having a wally in my back pocket! I drove Eddie's car to work so if I got pulled over I could run from the cops and they would think that I was Eddie. Oh well, I didn't get pulled over and I didn't get to run from the cops and die in a shoot out. Maybe next time.  Mungo, I am sorry that you are still having head problems. I feel sorry for your neck getting caught in the middle and all. I hope that things get better for you soon. If you need anything let me know. I could try and overnight myself to FL to hang with you. I don't think that I can fit in an envelope though.  Onward ho's.  ST

It's all clusters in my head.  Like a tripod spinning straight.  Like a bashed mayor's brain.  Like Florida on fire.  Positive energy in my head, negative energy in my chest tears up the center of my neck.  Douse the mentally crippled in burning oil and spew them seaward.)  Peace and Love, Ned.

      I am still going to road trip it to Vegas.  I don't know how much money I've got, I might have to borrow from my folks or rob someone, but I'll make it.  This week I'm going to get my car fixed.  I have finally saved up enough for that.  I talked to Bubbles and he's still planning on making it to Vegas as well.  But he doesn't have his ticket yet.  He said he'll wait for the three month mark.  What's that...June?  Yow.  June.  I have a lot of snot in my right nostril.  I want to blow it.  I'm still going to move to Anchorage too, even though Hillary and I aren't together and she was the only reason I was moving up there so early.

Is the money situation going to work out?  Bubbles, when are you going to get your ticket? It is getting to the point that I am going to need to make some plans.  I have to start planning my leave and getting my head together. I know money is going to be tight for everyone so even if we just hang out and crap like that I will be cool with it.  Waz up?

      Home from Utah. Trip was good. We took the new Focus so the gas was free...can't beat that with a stick. In case anyone doesn't know Beck has a Ford Focus as a company car. FREE. Ashlee was good for a kid hitting the terrible twos and having an attitude.  We looked at houses all day on Sat. With the money that we will get out of this place we could buy a log cabin (4,500 square feet) which is double the size of our house and it was on 5.35 acres of land! We won't buy something that big but we could because of the way real estate is going here in Vegas. It will be lots of fun to actually go shopping for a house when the time comes.  Amy is buying our Maxima so that is going to be done! Woo hoo. We sold it for less than we owe so now we have to come up with some cash to make up the difference but at least it is sold. We sold it for $14,000 and it blue books for over $19,500! I guess the blue book is only good if you can actually sell it for that much. We have been trying to sell it for months and not one call from the add in the paper. I think the 6 speed turns people off. Oh well. That will free up over $500 a month in payments, insurance and gas.  That is all.  ST

      Don't know if y'all heard the word, but a 1C5 was killed a week ago from a mortar attack.  This was being briefed by a MSgt in our flight to the airmen.  One of them, born in Oakland California in 1985, said, "Whoa whoa whoa.  No.  Na-uah!  I was under the impression that we didn't GO to war in the Air Force."  So, because of her and other like-minded idiots, we're taking them to Hurlbert Field tomorrow to the test AOC they have there.  The tour will be given by a guy I deployed with last year, SSgt Mabe.  Also along with the tour will be some helocopter gunners and some TACPs that have been told to  make it real  for our uneducated airmen.  This should be interesting.  Double O, there may be a second dude making the AlAskA trip this May.  Jeremy, the dude we just picked up from the airport, wants to come along too.  He's a good guy.  Well... he's an ass.  But he's a good guy.  So, he's a lot like Eddie.  Peace and Love, Mungo

ST is probably driving back from UT right now, trying to pay attention to his GPS and not the road, while the kid and wife scream "OH SHIT!!!"  I got back together with Elena. Rather interesting how it all worked out. I don't feel like typing that much right now, so I will add to that story later. But for now, I will just let you know that everything has been smoothed out.  Not too much else going on in my life right now. Just fixin to get ready to go to the gym for Monday morning PT.

He is the commander of Material Command. There was also a 2 star there as well. I had fun for the most part. It was too tame though.  Just got home and getting ready to leave. I work tomorrow (Fri) then right after work we are jumping in the car and driving to Utah to visit family. We will be driving our happy asses back on Sun evening so I can work on Mon. Geez.  Okay peepers. I will blog at you later (probably when I get home on Sun night).  GPS kicks ass.

      Okay okay okay.  So things with Hillary and I haven't been so smooth lately.  I went out tonight with Kelly.  She is... SO much fun, that it's very hard being home alone right now, but I am.  I'm not one to cheat on anyone, you guys probably know that, but lemme tell ya about the will power it took.  Y'all know the differnce between "yes" and "no?"  I know you do.  And you also know how much harder it is to say "no" when you really want to say "yes."  I almost feel like I've been cheating because of how hard it was tonight to resist.  Dammit.  Kelly made me laugh.  If you guys had been around me the last few days, you would be very impressed.  Until she did it, I wouldn't have thought I was even capable of laughing.  I need to stop now.

      I love each and everyone of you guys equally; but not in that gay kinda way.  (Sorry ST)  As I am sitting here in Barrow waiting for my flight at 6:40pm tonight, I began to notice a trend around this little town.... NO TREES!!!  Its amazing how such a little thing as having trees can make a difference in a place.  The snow drifts have nothing to cling on to, the very few birds have no place to rest, and not a single tire swing to swing the days away.    What im trying to get to is that BARROW SUCKS!!  But all in all, i have had a good stay here and am looking forward to comming back if need be.  I hope next time i will have the privilage of seeing a polar bear or two.

      Remember this? "I told her I bought 5 stripety notebooks for my new book, "Highway 9." Sounds reasonable, right? Now, you'll will all have to forgive her for the question she asked, she doesn't know me as well as ya'll do. You would never ask me this question. She asked, "Erik, what happens if you run out of matching stripety notebooks?" AH! I freaked. I covered my head in a blanket and excused myself from the phone for a minute. I had to hide. Today I went back to the store in hopes they had more notebooks of the same kind. They did! Relief. I bought 5 more. Do any of you think I'll need more than 10 notebooks? Two hundred pages each. Times 10 = 2,000 pages. I should be okay now."  Ya ya, long quote, but seriously.  I have twenty stripety notebooks now.  I keep freaking out that I'll use all of them up.  Not very likely, no.  It's not, I know.  No, know.  In the no.  Know, you may not. Peace and Love for a running dog, Mungo

      I SAID IT WAS A MISHAP!  That means all the itallics shit was done in accident mode, not on purpose.  What happened was this:  I had the long title for one of my last blogs, the one about Infinity, and I wanted to put the parenthathiesed part in itallics.  The problem is that the markings used for making something I TAL LICK (    ) was incomplete because of space restraints in the Title field.  The second half was cut cleanly off and consequently itasised EVERTHING below it, even in the other blogs.  MISHAP.         Do                         Do Do           Do             Do           Do                     Do                          Do   You have entered . . . . . . The Mungo Zone!

      Well... That was nonetheless interesting... I found myself laughing quite a bit. But I don't know why. I especially liked #5. For some reason, this struck me as really fucking funny. You need to get out of your room more, or quit drinking... one or the other. he he he...  Mungo... Just to let you know... Having the fucked up grill will impact the performance of your vehicle. This screws with the aerodynamics which will cost gas. This may not make a huge impact, but it does make an impact. Besides that, it looks like something that should be parked in front of a trailer. And I don't mean ST's camping trailer.  ST, just make sure he does not steal my bumper in September.  For God's Sake man... Please stop the Italic shit.  OUTTIE  Eddie

      1. Get a good pen and draw a straight line which does not end. You may also need to find some very long paper and a very long surface on which to put it. Concentrate on your feelings of superiority to the miserable creatures who must live in a single dimension, two whole dimensions less than you. Ha, ha. They can't even tie their shoes, because they don't have room to bend over.   2. Peel an infinitely large onion. (You can usually find these in the produce aisle of your local chain grocer; if that fails, try online at one of those infinite-produce Web sites you've heard so much about.) To reduce eye irritation, try holding an infinitely long matchstick in your mouth. Be careful not to cover any major metropolitan areas with the discarded skins. Do not eat it! You are finite and will probably die or at least get very bad indigestion from eating anything infinite, let alone an onion.   3. Approach an asymptote. Do not be nervous — it's probably just as scared as you are. Ask it if it wants to get some coffee or maybe catch an old Bogart flick. Be prepared to wait while the ticket taker asks to see its ID. If anything goes wrong, don't panic; remember that you are not infinite, and you can leave if you want to.   4. Go about your business as usual. If anyone asks what you are doing, open your mouth and inhale all the matter in the universe.   5. Cancel a date with your significant other; when asked why, explain that you are trying to approach infinity, and that it is very insensitive of him / her to not understand that. Say, "You're just so finite." Then laugh to yourself because when you get right down to it, you're pretty finite too, more or less. Make up and have a never-ending vanilla malt.   6. Gather your belongings on a cloudy day. Set sail for an island off the coast of wherever you live. Give thanks to the sea for bearing you away from your heartaches and troubles. Repeat c. 35 trillion times.   7. Send a letter to yourself and when you get it, write "Return to Sender" on it. Be sure to hold on to a lamppost or bench so you are not sucked into the resulting vortex. (Just kidding; there's no way to escape.)   8. Make a very, very tall stack of turtles. If someone asks you if you are trying to recreate the ancient myth of the world being supported on the back of a turtle, which is on the back of another turtle, and so forth, say, "No, I am just stacking turtles. What myth was that again?"   9. Realize that even if you multiply infinity raised to the infinity power times infinity plus infinite infinities, there's always room for a little bit more. Try not to be infuriated by this and brood; accept it as a part of the nature of things. Punch your pillow if you need to.   10. Contemplate plenum. Contemplate void. Contemplate Daisy Duke and that painter guy on "Murphy Brown" playing Hearts recursively with Stephen Hawking and your Freshman roommate, on a steel raft floating in a sea of lava. Hold all these things in your heart and ponder them forever.   11. Weigh your dissent over time, first in metric units (grams per second) and then in English units (grains per fortnight). Take the integral of the function used to compute the difference, write it down, and arrange to have it tattooed on your back. Chicken out at the last minute.   12. Throw a can of tomato soup at the speed of light. Then travel back in time to catch it and invent tomato soup in 1983 and make a fortune.

       This Guitar has never been tuned but this song has always been for you  Take four stones, pass them down One by one you win  A new set of clothes, a room stopped in time A little game of stones, and a coffee mug of wine  You're the one that sings the songs You're the one that        brings down the dawn  Listen to the sounds we make And the little stones we break We'll pass our stones for to fill Empty phones with a long distance bill  It's food and it's fodder,  we don't need it all With swans on the water,  and water on your wall  It was just one moment,  mutual atonement A new thing bent into a candid habit  If a blind man can touch his chest and steal a movement of love from afar Then it's easy to sing, and it's easy to feel when all the words rhyme with what you are  It only takes a parking lot bet It only takes a swimming pool It only takes a few basic frets It takes me an you

      In three days, it will be the 6-Year anniversary of the day I found out Jill W. would be moving away from Iowa and out of my life forever.  It's strange.  6 years ago, today, Jill and I were sitting on the fire escape of the First Baptist Church in Osage discussing nothing, just skipping out on what we probably should have been doing.  I miss her as much now that she's gone as I did the day I left her at her door for the last time.  The Minnesota Twins are 3-3.  In my expert opinion, they're so-so.

      "...and to us it was.  Osage, Iowa in November of 1997 was home to exactly 3,503 little Iowans.  Osage was then, and is to this day, the seat of Mitchell County.  (It was stolen from Mitchell Township in 1907 through a series of shady deals made my Chuck Unsurewhoheis.  True story.)  Osage was home to the county fair and all kinds of legal papers in the court house on Chase Street.  With its TWO active water towers, its eleventy churches, all nine police officers, three factories (making socks, binding paper, and drying blood), and FOUR stop lights...Osage was something special, alright.

      Nearly every week, I hear the horror in my parents' voices from eleven hundred miles away as they plumb the depths of my cynicism and despair. They do not recognize in this young man the writing enthusiast they raised, the boy who wanted nothing more than to write good books (perhaps the Great One) from the time he was old enough to want anything ... or at least old enough to realize how much math was involved in a career as an astronomer.    HIGHWAY 9  is going nowhere, and, with the exception of David Foster Wallace, Dave Eggars, and that Volleman fellow, every newish novel I've read has been terrible.  How am I supposed to advance the art of Novelty Novelty (he he) if I hate what is being done now?  "Then again and all the time,   Every minute, never ending,  Unrelenting all around  This world falling indesidiously.  Ovulating movement,  Motion:  this way, that way.  Always take a free fall,  Love love, kiss kiss,  Make do.  FREE TO BE is what I need."  Peace and Love, Mungo   Song of the day:  Elf Power - "Nothing's Going to Happen"

      Deadened in this sleep this morning, I dreamt of incredible heat.  I'm approximately awake now, in that ball park.  Good.  I'm going to head outside to the beach with a novel of Richard Brautigan, my  Highway 9  notebooks, a waterbottle, and make an attempt to soak up sun filtered through generous helpings of SPF...  Whoa.  Okay.  Hold.  Giddy down.   Forget all that. Cold and cloudy--it is. By COLD, I say it's 66 F.  By cloudy, I say, crossing the sky like marshy astroids. Hokay. Change of the plans. Titrade in my head.  I'll go to the Used Book Bin II and I'll engage myself in active book speech to the owner there, his name is  Bastus .  This windy one is a real treat if there is a day you can find him.  He is widly informed into which in the modern world of printing, goes. I think about the disorder I suffer, and thank the good Lord that I am not suffering from HIS disorder.  Quiet and locked up, hysteria in his brain, trapped inside.  Quiet hysteria, perhaps trapped inside, building up under his old gray skin, causing his forehead to buldge in that strange way that it does.  When I find out what new used books he's got, and which of the other 200,000 I've already discarded as "Books Erik Will Never Frigging Read."  Books like, "Trapped," now a Major Motion Picture.  And "Ten Habits of Highly Effective People."  No thank you.  After the Bin I'll headed up to Books-A-Million and buy coffee and leave immediately.  Temptation is too large if I remain there for length. I must find a place quiet which I can trail-off with my eyes closed. It would be nice.  A quiet place.  I need that kind of quiet.

       I was looking through some old posts and found this quote from Eddie.   "...we had Jones Energy Drink. It tasted slightly different than the other energy drinks only because every energy drink tastes the same with a slight difference in each."  WTF?

      Happy Easter to the mo fo's out there. Yes, Eddie had Easter already but that is just too bad.  I read about the easter bunny beatings...that is just nuts.   I need to start figuring out how the whole blogger book is going to work. I will have to put everything in a document backwards so you won't have to read from front to back. Or maybe I will make it like a hebrew book where you DO read it front to back AND left to right! WOW, that would be fun trying to read with out loosing you mind. I shall start playing with it. I will need to work on the formatting and crap like that. I want to get something out around Oct or Nov since that will be a year of writing.  Eddie having trouble between two women. Sucks to be you...NOT. I am glad that I am married and happy! No more games and crap like that....hold on...okay fine, the games have just changed in to married type head games! Great....SAVE ME FROM THIS HELL!  Beck is going to kick my butt now! Hee hee. Just kidding honey!  ST  PS. Anyone have a couch that I can crash on when I get kicked out of my house?

      I like monkeys.  The pet store was selling them for 5¢ each. I thought that was odd since they were normally a couple thousand dollars each. I decided not to look a gift horse in the mouth.  I bought 200.  I like monkeys.  I took my 200 monkeys home.  I have a big car.  I let one of them drive. His name was Sigmund.  He was retarded. In fact, none of them were really bright. They kept punching themselves in their genitals.  I laughed.  Then they punched my genitals.  I stopped laughing.  I herded them into my apartment.  They didn't adapt very well to their new environment.  They would screech, hurl themselves off of the couch at high speeds and slam into the wall.  Although humorous at first, the spectacle lost its novelty halfway into its third hour.  Two hours later I found out why all the monkeys were so inexpensive: they all died.  No apparent reason.  They all just sort of dropped dead.  Kind odd like when you buy a goldfish and it dies five hours later.  Damn cheap monkeys.  I didn't know what to do. There were 200 dead monkeys lying all over my apartment. On the bed, in the dresser, hanging from my bookcase.  It looked like I had 200 throw rugs.  I tried to flush one down the toilet.  It didn't work. It got stuck.  Then I had one dead, wet monkey and 199 dead, dry monkeys.  I tried pretending that they were just stuffed animals.  That worked for a while.  That is until they began to decompose.  Then it started to smell real bad.  I had to pee but there was a dead monkey in the toilet and I didn't want to call the plumber.  I was embarrassed.  I tried to slow down the decomposition by freezing them.  Unfortunately, there was only enough room for two monkeys at a time, so I had to change them every 30 seconds.  I also had to eat all the food in the freezer so it didn't all go bad.  I tried burning them.  Little did I know my bed was flammable.  I had to extinguish the fire.  Then I had one dead, wet monkey in my toilet, two dead, frozen monkeys in my freezer, and 197 dead, charred monkeys in a pile on my bed.  The odor wasn't improving.  I became agitated at my inability to dispose of my monkeys or use the bathroom.  I severely beat one of my monkeys.  I felt better.  I tried throwing them way but the garbage man said that the city wasn't allowed to dispose of charred primates.  I told him that I had a wet one.  He couldn't take that one either.  I didn't bother asking about the frozen ones.  I finally arrived at a solution.  I gave them out as Christmas gifts.  My friends didn't know quite what to say.  They pretended that they like them but I could tell they were lying.  Ingrates.  So I punched them in the genitals.  I like monkeys.

      So here I am... Easter Sunday and I am going golfing. I hope y'all have some good dinners.  Status update... I  think  it is over between Elena and I. I also told Steph that I wanted to just hang out. This did not go over well lastnight, but then we talked about it today. It is all cool now with Steph and she is actually glad I said it. After thinking that it was just another notch on the belt, it was hard to explain to her why I didn't want to have that kind of a relationship. We did, however, decide that we should not drink around eachother. Just ends up not being right. We have that little thing of letting shit slip when we are around eachother and tipsy.   The deal with Elena, on the otherhand... Here is how it went down. I went out to the bar Friday.. This is after I had been drinking for 6 or 7 hours prior, I bought her a juice. No biggy, just wanted to sit and hang. She said something that apparently pissed me off and I got up, grabbed the juice and took it back to the bar and said "give the money back!" The bad thing is I don't remember what the hell was said. Either way... it was not good.  So, there you have it... I have cut off both and still kept one friend atleast. But, as a spindoctor I know that works for PA says "Everything is repairable." I don't know if I want to repair that one though.  This is going to make for an interesting book when these are printed out. Maybe it will be a "Coffee Table" book... he he he...  Well, y'all... life here is still interesting.   I miss my kid.

      I took a ride yesterday to the village of Lickesac, or something like that, to see where the hell we were flying fuel to.  Man is it small.  I couldn't believe that people would live out in the middle of no where.  What these people are doing out there is beyond my knowledge.  I got some pictures inflight and i will be sure to send them to you guys as soon as i get them developed.  Some village names I have come up with since i have been here:  Lickesac, Sucatit, Pasingas, Wannakisit, and the list goes on and on.  So far things are going good.  We've only had minor mechanical problems except for a carborator change on one #4 engine.  Ive been puting about 12-15 hours a day, so I hope to make bank when its all said and done.  freez'n my azz off,  Double O

      Mungo i am so sorry to hear that you lost a great friend.  I remember you talking about her often and i hope my condolances find your heart.  I am presently writting you all from the King Eider hotel in Barrow, Alaska.  YES I AM IN BARROW!!!   You cant get any further north Alaska than that.  NAC was given a contract to fly fuel to a small village south of Barrow, and they needed my expertice to complete the mission. (well, not really, but i wanted to go)  Its about 0 here right now and lots of nothing.  As i was flying here from Fairbanks, i was amazed by how desolate it is bast the Brooks Mountain Range.  After the mountains, there is absolutely nothing for miles and miles.  And then there is Barrow.  Havent seen any polar bears yet, but I did see some caribou right outside the runway today.    Hope everyone is doing well and I will be intouch.  Double O

      Bro, I am sorry to hear about your loss. Feel this though... Your loss is our loss because of the pain. You know that we are all brothers. The way I feel is that we are beyond what blood ties. They say that family is the thing that will never leave you, this may be true, but you 3 are the ones that will never leave my side, and nor will I leave yours.  My prayers are with you. And I would guess that even ST's would be even though the boy has no faith other than what his wife gives him. he he he...  On the real side though, we are always there for you.  On this one I will sign this differently...   The Bro's

      My friends, the news I've been fearing for the last 15 months hit me last night at 6 p.m.  Jill Westergard, the girl I'm writing my new book about, died on March 28th from a siezure.  She was in a car accident in New York on Thanksgiving 2002 and has been in bad shape ever since.  Maybe I should praise God for ending her pain.  I can't say anything else.  Don't remember ever being this sad.  Mungo

I'm actually going to get my lomo style photos together into the same albums... now that I know there is a category for them.  AWESOME.  Oh yaw, Eddie.  Remember:  If the worst problem you have in your life is choosing between women...Well, let's just say there are men we all know that would kill to be in that position!  Relax and do what you KNOW is the right thing.  I'd wager you already know.  Square your shit away, grab your balls, and do the right thing for yourself.

      THESE WORDS ARE JUST MY OPINION!  I am not there and don't know either woman BUT...I know that you will NEVER move to Russia to live. Also, I would wonder about Elena's motives. Does she want to just find someone so she can get to the US? I am not saying you aren't a good catch...hell if I were a woman...nevermind. Anyway, woman jumping on GI's for a "ride" to the states happens ALL the time. Just be careful with her.  Steph seems like she is more stable...meaning that she will be there your whole tour, she is moving back to the US sooner or later and you KNOW she isn't after your money.  Yes, break it off with one of them. Do it soon. Be kind and do it face to face. Expect it to get cold with the one you break it off with (duh!).  It is obvious which one I would rather see you with but I am NOT there and don't know the whole story so it is up to you. Also, remember that you aren't looking for the one right now, right? Or is Eddie having a change of heart and may be open to the idea of a relationship?  Another thought...Is Steph staying in or is she getting out? Just wondering.  Good luck and let us know what goes down.   ST  Now I want some stupid cresents! Dang it!

      Blowing people off and ignoring them is a terrible idea, whether you hate someone or not.  And you don't hate either of these girls.  Those three little words are dangerous.  If you can't say them back without lying, don't.  And if you don't see that relationship going anywhere, the sooner you tell her that:  the better.  I think men have a certain obligation to women to guard  women's  hearts.  With the exception of me and a few others out there, men are typically slower to "fall."  Women, on the other hand, are far more emotional and fall faster and deeper than men ever ever ever do.  If you choose to end the dealyo with Elena, be kind and do it face to face.  If you choose to end the dealyo with Steph, explain things to her as well.  But I think it definitely is for the best to end it with one of them, and soon.  Don't string Steph along while you're renting hotel rooms out with Elena...I don't think it would be fair to either of them...Especially if Steph is someone you're looking at perusing a relationship with.  That's all I have.  (and you know this line is coming....)  I support you either way you choose.  Peace and Love, Mungo

      First off... Mungo, I hope your crescents were good...  Next up... I finally talked to Elena and what I was assuming was her being pissed off apparently was not. She came right up to me when I saw her and planted a wet one on me (kiss that is... fucking pervs) This is not exactly what I was expecting. I was actually hoping for the cold shoulder. That would have made it easier to stay away and break it off that way. Instead we actually had to talk things out. I basically told her that I felt like I was getting to close and that I was not going to be around as often. Yeah, this worked real well, right up until the point where we got the hotel room. So I still said the stuff about us needing to back down a bit, but damn... The chick is a hottie, even when she has no make-up on, so it is not brutal to wake up to in the morning. So, needless to say, it didn't pan out the way I was expecting it to.   Now here comes the other issue. Steph is a good person. There is some stuff that I will tell y'all about if you catch me on messenger, but I am not going to post it here and I would prefer that you did not add your guesses to what it is on here either. Anyway, so Steph is 30, brown hair, blue eyes, SSgt type. What is it with me and 30 yr olds right now... It is almost funny... We went to the OHOP (Osan House Of Pancakes) and had dinner tonight... Well, more like breakfast, but anyway, we went out to eat. Sat there for a while and talked then she stopped by my room and we just kinda hung out and I gave her a back massage. (honestly, nothing else involved in tonight's endeavor and all of our clothes remained on.) Don't really know what else to really say about Steph, other than it is another cool chick to hang with.  So the dilemma part of this... Man, I feel like an idiot. It would have been better if Elena just blew me off and didn't want to talk to me. By the way... She also said those 3 little words to me and I started to get nervous. And no, the 3 words were not "Lick my clit"... Unfortunately... That would have been easier to deal with too. However, I like Steph too, but I don't really see that going anywhere either. Elena is supposed to leave in the near future though (that is what she says anyway) Steph will be here until I PCS and I don't have to translate shit when I talk to her, unless we get into the shop talk type shit. Man, I really never expected to be in this situation. I never found myself to be that attractive (though I don't think I am Quasimodo either) and my personality is generally cocky as shit. Not exactly the best qualities in a person. Fuck dudes... Do I blow one off or just pretend like nothing is going on. I have a feeling that the latter would backfire at some point though. I could just see walking around and, hey, there are both of them talking to eachother or some shit like that. You know, the worst case scenario. This is actually making me chuckle a bit while I am typing. My sense of humor really is  fucked  up.  Fuckin A buddies... Fuckin A.

      So there I was... Lets just say, things got rocky between Elena and I. She was saying shit about not trusting me and some other happy horseshit that just pissed me off. Needless to say, I have not talked to her since then. Granted that is all of 2 days, but hey, ya gotta start somewhere.   To add to that, I decided to go and hang with some other friends. We went to a couple different places and ended back at the club she works at (Club Name: Your Club)... No big deal right... wrong... Here is the situation: I get ticked off at Elena, I go to another bar to hang with the other friends... I get there and there is Stephanie... yup... uh oh #1. I have occasionally chatted with this chick on a few instances. Nothing big really, except me, 2 other friends and Steph had gone out earlier in the day to have lunch. Dudes... It almost felt like a setup. So anyway... back to the bar scene. We are hanging at this one, then get bored and go to another then ended up at Your Club. Yes, this is the club that I DJ at as well. So what impression do you think was taken by Elena? Yup, you probably guessed it, she thought that I went off to find another chick. At least that is how I took it when she glared at me when I walked in with Steph. Well, this probably would have gone over somewhat more decently until I got glared at while we were dancing. First just regular dancing, then a slow song came on and she asked me to dance with her. Well, we all know Eddie enough to dance with a chick when she asks. (Unless this bitch is ugly and then Eddie avoids it like the plague.) Well, Steph ain't ugly, so there ya go. More glares. Then, after I was pretty well toasted after too many drinks, Steph said it was time to go. We went... right passed Elena and out the door. I am assuming this probably did not go well either, since I was leaving with a chick and didn't say goodbye. So, there is another blown relationship in the world of Eddie. No huge suprise to me and I doubt it is to y'all either.  I am not really upset about this though. A lot of ups and downs and too much fucking drama. I guess I am getting a bit tainted being over here, because I think the old Eddie would have been a a bit more distrought about the whole situation.   Well... FIDO.  Eddie

I am definately breathing, it's a terrible reason.  Wrecking itself.   Well gentlemen, now that the SRB for the first term 1C5 slicks has dropped to a 2, there seems to be a new factor to consider in my decision quest.  I am of the mind that I can find a job that pisses me off anywhere, and with almost no icing on the cake now, I'm thinking "Elsewhere" is where I'll be seeking my future employment.  And if I have to pay for the medical and dental insurance out of pocket, so be it.  Speaking of Sobe, have you guys tried the Lava flavor yet?  It's strawberry daquri flavored.  I gustoed one yesterday, finished it off in less than 5 minutes.  I had a pretty bad tummy ache afterwards, but it was wonderful.  ...taking you with me...  I'll be getting my WT Tanker pre-eval tomorrow.  Monday should be my eval.  I'll be happy to be out of training (again).  As for the irresponsibility of the A1C, I'll be writing an enormous MFR today at work.  I'll post parts of it here so you guys can share my pain.... since you asked for it.  ST - Happy Day to you.  Eddie - What hours are your mid-shifts.  I'd like to see if I can call you before you go into work.  When would be a good time?  Double O - Like Eddie said, where the Fuji are you?  Gents - Looking forward to seeing you all again, whenever those times come...  Peace and Love, Mungo de doe che   Song of the day:  Pinback - "Tres"

      I don't know which home on the range this is. Oh well.  We made it home and the trailer is up on base just waiting for July 4th. Boy, do I have the camping bug now! WOO WOO!  I got off of work over 3 hours early on Fri because they were expecting winds to "delay" getting home so they figured it was better to get everyone out early rather than 2-4 hours late! So, we were able to get on the road early which allowed us to get to camp and set up while it was still sunny out. Good stuff. We did a few hikes and just generally relaxed.  On Sat we deciced to go out and find some geocaches outside the park so we all piled in the truck along with Tahoe (in the back). After some good off roading we found where they were located and set out hiking to find them. Two of the caches were just okay but the hike to the third one was great. We also discovered that Tahoe must have been a mountain goat in a previous life! He was running all over the desert like a wild dog...up and down the steep rocks! When we found the cache he was worn out so he decided to lay down and take in the view. Tahoe plopped down right on the edge of a cliff with his snout hanging over the edge! The drop was at least 50 feet straight down and there is my dog just chilling and taking in the scenery...too funny.  For most of the weekend we just relaxed and visited with Chris, Aimee, Brooklyn and Walker. The weather couldn't have been better and the fires couldn't have smelled better. Yes, folks, the outdoors pretty much rocks balls.  ST out.

      I wish there was actually shit to blog. I will think of shit as I go I guess.  I have softball practice in about 2 hours. Sunday morning, 9 am. I picked this time since it is the least likely to have people using the field. I have actually been waiting for it. I like to play.  Went out the past couple nights. Primarily just shooting pool, since there ain't a whole hell lot else to do. I am getting good. Oldfart is still better than me, and will be for a long time, but I am definately better than I was 6 months ago. I get beat by other people mainly because I fuck up, not because they are better.  We have gotten a fan basis while we play now. There are these Phillipino chicks that have begun to enjoy watching us play. Distracting as hell because a couple of them are pretty cute. This is saying a lot since I am not a huge fan of most Phillipino chicks. But these ones do not hurt the eyes to look at.  I talked to Elena last night. That went pretty well. She is doing alright, not great, but alright. I miss the hell out of her. Almost as much as I miss L and my bro's.  I wonder if ST is wearing that gay ass yellow special olympics shirt saying "It's Memorial Day."? He is probably having a blast right now. I wish I were there to enjoy the festivities.  Mungo should be having a good time too right now. He probably hooked up with some chick that he met at Koots and then went "Hey Hillary, this is Jenny, Oh, I'm sorry, is this your best friend?" he he he...  We went to some "Memorial Day Bash" yesterday. It sucked. Oldshit and I worked at a stand for about 30 minutes, then wandered around aimlessly for a few minutes and then bailed. They had live music, but it blew goat nuts. Some chick wearing MC Hammer pants with a couple others mixed in. There was an actual band there that sounded pretty good for the 2 minutes that we heard of them while we were waiting for the free round trip tickets to the US drawing. Neither one of us won.  Time to go drink more coffee and fuck around for a while.  Dueces  Eddie

      Okay slobs, I am blogging for the last time until Mon night. Unlike Mungo, who said he wasn't blogging for two weeks, I won't be near a computer. NO BLOGGY HERE!  We have all the camping hook ups. Steaks one night, smores and all the other goodies. I will be trying a new camping treat...pies. Usually, you get a pie iron (like an iron square clam shell with long handles) then you place a piece of bread on one side. Next, you put some pie filling on the bread and top it with the other piece of bread. Close the iron, cut off any edges hanging out and cook over the fire. Well, I am going to use some big ole butter flavored biscuits instead of bread...mmmmm, good.  We are even taking Tahoe with us on this trip. He has been to Zion once before and was well behaved so he gets to go again. He will also go on some 4x4 trails outside the park with us to find some geocaches. I think Mungo would LOVE geocaching!!! I know Eddie will when he gets back. I don't think 007 would ever go. Oldfluff might like it too.  The downside to this trip...the weather forecast is predicted up to 40mph winds tomorrow. You want some seat of the pants fun? Pull a 10,000 pound, 11 feet tall and 30 feet long trailer in winds hitting 40mph! Woo Woo...okay no WOO WOO here. It will suck and it will be reality. I will just go slow and become religious really fast as the wind hits the trailer's side and we just change lanes...or end up on the shoulder. That is the fun part...where and when will we move up to 8 feet sideways? Just hope no one is there or that the shoulder is nice and wide! WOO WOO!  I am rambling now. I am dead tired so it is off to the shower with me then to bed...later.  Until Monday, ST

      I was up at 0600 this morning to wash the trailer, roof and all. It gets really dusty sitting in a dirt lot for months at a time. The inside is next.  I am off of work today so I could go to a commander's call this morning. Nice. Now I am off to get the trailer ready to go! All this damn work just so I can go and have some fun! WOO WOO.  Later guys. I will try and blog more later if I'm not too busy. Tommorow I get up at 0300 go to work and get home around 1415 and jump in the truck and go. I am taking Eddie's car to work so I can hook up the truck tonight.  ST out.

      Mungo, we want to hear all about your experiences getting ass raped by a bear out in the woods while camping. OK, so maybe just the fun shit you did.  I read the last blog by ST and it put a smile on my face. The reason it did this is because Beck said it made her miss me more. I miss y'all too and I have just over 6 months left. When will our camping trip be?  I hope to hell Elena likes it. Otherwise I will have to blow off yet another wife to go camping with the bro. he he he... I think she will. It is not really like we are roughing it out there.  Oh, Mungo, I got the Morris' confused. The one that is there is Mo not Mookie. Either way, tell him I said hi and get his bitch ass back to work.  Later  Eddie

      We were 10 hours late getting in to Anchorage.  But we made it.  We rented a car (pimpin a white Kia Rio) and we haven't slept yet.  Timo, Double O, and Mungo are zombies today... Bubbles is at work.  We're headed out to a camp ground in about an hour.  Double Bubble gets off work in 30 minutes... making the run down to Cooper's Landing.  I'm at Bermudez's hizous, just BSin' until it's time to peace.  Haven't even called Hillary yet and we won't be back in town until Friday night. Lissy is a beautiful little girl and she said my name today, "Momo."  So sweet.  Pimpin the Rio, Mungo

      Sorry I didn't call you back Eddie! I got side tracked at work. Hope all is well with you.  We went and got the trailer today. Walking into it got me in the mood to go camping bigtime! WOO WOO! I am going to be busy getting it ready to go! Beck, said that being in the trailer mader her miss you more. She also said that Elena had better like camping or there is going to be some ass kicking! Okay, so I added the last part of that sentence but she really did say Elena had better like it!  ST out

      I just couldn't let tuesday go by without a blog on it. Even though it is Wednesday here.  ST called me this morning... I went to sleep about 2 hours prior so I didn't have much of a clue of what was going on. He said he would call me back. Maybe he will, maybe he won't.  Mungo is in AK now, hopefully living it up. WOO WOO for Mungo.  Eddie

      Mungo, Tell Mookie I said hi. He knows nothing of my relationship. Keep it that way for right now. Word moves to quickly and I don't feel like completely publicising it to the unit right now. Not that I am ashamed of it in any way, just don't feel like having extra fingers in the potato chips. Whatever the hell that means. Plus, he really liked her.  Have a good time in AK. I wish I could talk to Hillary right now. I know what I would say... Well, actually, I don't know what I would say, but I am sure I could always think of something if the opportunity arrised.  ST, Bummer about the little hog. At least it is not your big hog. Something needs to tow your fat ass around when it is not firmly planted in the F-250 Superduty V-10. Though I appreciate it when we go on camping trips.   I have talked to the Oldman about going on some camping trips when we get back. I think he is in on it for atleast a couple times. His trips will be like mine coming from Mt Hell. We can meet up though and caravan from there. It would be nice if he fucking blogged more too.  Speaking of camping... I have to remember to ask Elena what she thinks of camping. This has not been something that has come up in our conversations yet. Though, the style of camping we do is pretty good, so it shouldn't be too big of a deal. I think it may feel real crowded though in the mornings when we are all waking up and triping over kids. Though we have had quite a few rugrats in there at any given time and it was not bad at all. It just gets bad when there are 10 people inside and you just want to sit back and relax and people just annoy the shit out of you. Though that happens when I am at home and there are more than 5 people that don't live there invading my house for whatever reason. OK, so I just don't like having a shitload of people around.   I am in the middle of my shift. I am on pager right now and have to go back in about 1.5 hours to do changeover. Then I get to come home and go to bed.  Have a fun and safe trip Mungo.  Peace out  Eddie

      I agree with you Mike.  I don't want to go to AlAskA with any dark shadows.  The weather will be bad enough when we get there.  I just want to go up and have a good time.  Get to chill with Double O for a few days and have a great time hiking and camping.  I don't want anything to ruin my trip, especially Hillary.  I will be seeing her tomorrow night, though.  I just hope we can be good to each other and keep the nasty stuff out.  Kevin Swaidek got to Florida on Saturday.  I got to hang out with him, that was cool.  Cathy Harcrow is here, Tommy Haycraft is at Hurlbert Field, and Mark Morris is back from Korea.  So strange.  People coming back like the dead.

      I can't have that! So here it is.  Mungo, I hope you get your brain better soon. Maybe it just needs to go outside to pee or something. Take it for a walk. Hopefully your AK trip will go well and Hillary isn't a dark shadow in your mind the whole trip. Jill will just have to get better with time. It's hard but, unfortunately, it is a crappy part of life. No, that isn't supposed to make you feel better, nothing can right now. Go have fun in AK, she would want that.  So today, no one wanted to blog, huh? Okay, that's cool. I can take up the slack since that is what friends do, right?  Beck and I went and looked at open houses that are for sale around us. Man, the housing market here has gone up about 30% - 40% in just the last year. The national average is about 3% a year. Good news for us. We then tried to find a geocache but didn't have any luck. We will go back there soon and get it. I went for a ride on the quads and now Beck's is having some problems. It just dies while out riding. I think that may be an electrical problem. Off to the shop with them for some tune-ups and any warranty work that needs to be done. Oh well.  I have to get up at 0400 so I am off to bed. Later guys.  ST

      An attachment disorder is a mental and emotional condition which occurs when a child has little or no successful  attachment to any one in the first years of life.  Without this attachment, children start life with a failure to bond, a natural instinct of humans. This lack of bonding also leads to impairments of the biochemical developments of the brain  (Hughes, 1997).

      I wasn't lying to Hillary the other day when I said I felt less.  We spoke for fewer fury. I wasn't trying to form the discussion more simply. I really believe that the distance between us is more real than its been before. I got interested in someone, but keep to in one while if away, when the reality of the relationship came above between us. I selected her in one instant over Melody, when I was forced to make this decision although I'm under no illusions or miss-conceptions in where I stand with her (or where she stands with me).  I love her.  I miss her.  I care about her.  I know that this isn't everything I can do or say to make her see me differently. and that's wrong.  But I said it because I wanted honesty with Hillary, I'm going see her the in a few days.  You now know this much.  I'm fighting as much as I can with bulletin hits.  Jill is still in my head, EACH INDIVIDUAL DAY is fresh. Work keeps worse.

      I came back from vacation, worked two days, and now it's the weekend. I work Monday, work Tues and overnight, have all day Wed and Thur off. I will then work on Fri and head out camping Fri afternoon. Why can't all work weeks be like this?  Yep, we are heading out to Zion National Park next Friday and will come home on Monday. I love camping!  Okay, today is Sat. Beck wants to go check out the garage sales around here so I will watch the kid while she goes. Not a bad deal since Beck let's me go ride the quads all the time. I think Ash and I will head out for a walk to Mickey D's for some beffest. I don't know what we are doing with the rest of  the day but I am sure that we will figure it out.

      OK so maybe not. Anyway, good on you Mungo for stepping in and being the adult in the situation. Did you ask the chick out again? Take advantage of the situation? he he he...  Yes I think ST and I waould have stepped in relatively quickly. However, there was a time that I was the asshole getting pissed at the waitress. But if she was cute, I just dealt with it and made quick smartass remarks.  On the other hand, this reminds me of a situation at Stoney's Desert Inn (The wanna-be VI of Mt Hell.) Similar thing going on, Lady bitching at a waitress really loudly the waitress tried to calm her down and was being polite. (A rarity at this joint) The lady didn't take the hint. I calmly walked over and asked the lady to calm down and sit or leave. She asked who the fuck I was to be getting into her business and at about that point is when I flashed the badge. She shut-up and sat down being quiet for the rest of the night. Ah, the fun you can have with people when you flash the star. I can't wait to get the fuck out and be a city cop.  Yes ST, I do have a big head. Kinda goes with the territory. Funny thing is, it is totally opposite when it comes to dealing with chicks that are attractive. I usually fuck that up within the first 30 seconds. Ahh well, no biggy. I have a hot one now and that is all that matters on the female front. Unfortunately, she is in another shithole on this planet.  Eddie

      Timo and I played a lot of pool tonight.  Seriously.  A LOT of pool.  Then we went to Waffle House where a very angry woman started yelling at the witress.  Yelling and yelling.  I stood up and approached her and told her maybe she should go home.  I said this because the other two employees (senior to the server) said NOTHING.  When the angry woman started making threats (I will fucking whip your ass, Cracker!  Suck my dick!  Suck my daddy's dick!  I will kill you bitch!)  That's when Timo and I surrounded her and told her to leave until she did.  We followed her to the parking lot until her friend took her away.  Then we found the nice girl behind the building crying and we talked to her until she calmed down.  Her boss came out at one point and Timo and I basically told him he was doing wrong by not stepping in.  I asked this same waitress out last week.  I got shot down, but I guess she was greatful to have some friendly faces around her tonight.  I think we helped her feel better.  But I feel like an ass for not interviening sooner.  The woman was insane with anger.  I wish Eddie and ST had been there.  That would have been interesting.  Neither of you two are as passive as I am!  Peace and Love, Mungo

      I read the blog from where I last posted then up. I get confused if I read out of order.  Mungo, women are the devil. Why we still get attatched I don't know, but we do. Bro, you have worked through all of your other relationship difficulties, so I know that you can work through this one too. We are always there to be the sounding board.  On a different note, my team shot a 67 today on the course. We were in second place by one stroke. (I said stroke.) I drove one over 300 yards today. It was actually around 315. I love my new driver. My shots off the tee definately carried us for 75% of the time. Yes I am bragging.  To add to the ego... Lt Hild, (Mungo probably knows him) a new AWO here is talking to another new Lt. (some goofy fucker that looks like the fly from our dorm days.) Anyway, Hild says to the Fly as I am walking by "You can learn a lot from this guy too."  I said to him "You haven't even seen me control, have you? But your right" Hild says "No, but other people have told me you are one of the best in the squadron." This is probably a smart move since I can screw him over if I wanted to being his instructor. he he he....  Anyway, golf was good. Hail and Bail after at the squadron was good. Going out tonight. I have had a few beers lately, but am keeping it under control. Oldman has been helping with that. I will probably just have a couple tonight too.  007, good to see you back on here. Sorry about having a bitchy wife. It happens sometimes.  Later peeps,  Eddie

      Someone should have warned me before reading this blog! I would have sat down with a bottle of Captain and some Coke! Eddie, do you feel better now? I understand that you sometimes just have to vent and get it off your chest. I pretty much agree with what you said.  As far as the drifting apart goes, that is a very real possibility. I don't think that it will happen though and the main reason I don't think that it will happen is because of the blog. I am actually addicted to getting on here and seeing what you guys have to say and what is going on with each of you (sort of that voyeuristic thing). More than that, though, is that I really like putting my thoughts into words and saving them for later. You know, like leftovers from a restaurant. I think that you guys are just as addicted and that addiction is what will keep us going. I know that I suck at calling people and rely on the computer for emails and the bloggie. If we stop keeping in touch then it will be a personal decision not to blog anymore or read up on what is happening with the blog. Okay I am starting to ramble.   Mungo , when you threw out the "...I CALL DOUBLE O." comment I was kind of annoyed with you. I got over it pretty fast though (30 seconds or so). You are the best at calling all of us and I respect you enormously for that. It is better than I can do so I see where you are coming from with that comment. The argument to that comment is that the phone works both ways. I can't use that argument though since I don't call either. That is where the blog or even email come in handy. You can blog ANY time of the day when you have a few minutes. No worrying about when the other person is at home, eating dinner, getting freaky...whatever. I guess I am trying to say that I see both sides of the situation but would still like to see 007 on here more sharing so that in 10 years I will be able to look at the book I plan on making and remember. It is going to be like a photo album that you pull out later in life and look at. Read parts here and there or read the whole thing. I hope it comes out like I want it to.   Oldshit , I hope that things are okay with you. From your recent blogs you sound like you aren't in you happy place right now. Discontent would be a good word to describe your bloggies. What is your brain telling you?   Bubble O , I am always glad to see you on here. Yes, we give you a hard time because we love you! That sounds faggish but too bad. We like to hear about what is going on with you. Look at some of our blogs...some of them are just what we ate for dinner and what it looked like on the way out the next day! Just getting on here and throwing your two cents in is always appreciated. How is work going? Wife? Kid? House? Is the summer up there just amazing? Are you looking forward to Mungo coming up so you guys can snuggle? Okay, okay...point made. Oh yeah, don't forget to enable your profile by clicking on your name over on the right side of the page.   Eddie , you know that we will always support you no matter what your decision is. We might give you a hard time but we are supporting you nevertheless.  Okay, is the drama over? Are we happy yet? I am now that I vented. I will make a regular post here in a second.

      Greetings all,  Sorry i have been away for a while, but after reading the blog i have come to a conclusion.....  YOU GUYS LOVE ME!!!!  I miss each and every one of yall.  I havent been able to get time on the computer since i came back from Barrow.  A contractor that works with me at nac doesnt have a car and I have been showing him around because it is summer and all.  Everything is going very well here.  Lissy is getting big. she will be 2 on june 9th.  i will send a pic to you guys.  J is still a pain in the ass, but what can i say.  I have been sick for about 4 days now.  I believe that it started with my first taste of alergy season.  I have never had alergies before, so i dont know what that's all about.  and of course about a week ago, i started excercising on a daily basis and cut back on smoking.  I think the my body is rebelling.    take it easy and be safe,  Double O

      In five days I'm flying to AlAskA with my friend, Timo.  It is going to be a super vacation.  It won't be no Dinny, but I guess the great outdoors of the last frontier will have to suffice.  ST, I'm happy to hear your vacation was a blasto.  It would have been nice if I could have made it down there, but alas.  The money situation said no.  There will be other days.  And the other days will come in September.  I can't tell you exactly when I'll be able to make it to Vegas.  I'll go over it with Doubles when I see him next week.  (that's so cool.) and I'll make sure he buys his ticket while I'm up there.  No excuses then!!  I played pool myself yesterday.  I was supposed to go out with my friend, Kelly.  She showed up, but only to tell me she was meeting two other people at a different bar.  She asked me to go, but the other bar was too far away and I knew it would be too crowded and noisy.  I've been getting ditched a lot lately.  I'm getting really sick of it.  Mungo   Song of the Day:  Built to Spill - "Else"

      So here I am, staying up late as hell so I can call back to the fucking east coast so I can try to get some answers on the paperwork hell. Well needless to say, it is beginning to use up a calling card like a mother fucker. OK, so I am exagerating a bit, but I am still frustrated because I keep getting different phone #'s to contact different offices and have to listen to fucking recordings for 10 minutes to get to the office that I think I needed and it really was not what I needed. UGH!!!  Anywho, Mungo, ya know, I appologize that I can not make a phone call to y'all to talk often. That is what the fucking computer is for using yahoo messenger. It is more cost effective for me and I do not use any phone cards. Realize that even when I call y'all that I am still using a phone card even with DSN. It is a 60 min a month phone card that is free, but that can be used up quite quickly. By the way, I am not really sorry.   There is a reason that ST started the blog. This is one of the main ones. We are all in different locations and this is the easiest way to stay in contact with one another. It takes  5 fucking minutes  out of your day to jot something down or make a comment about what someone else said or asked. I guess  5 fucking minutes  is too much to ask from people every couple days for bro's that mean the world to me and I would do anything possible I could do for them.   Too much to ask? I think fucking not.  Mungo, this was not meant to be a direct attack at you, however, you were the nearest target and the BVR bitchslap had to be made.  OO could take the time to put  something  down at a  minimum  of once a week. He is one of my bro's and there is much love for him, but he is a fucking slacker when it comes to this. I still have my thoughts of why he doesn't blog, but fuck, throw that on here or tell you that when he talks to you. She can't be hovering around him 24/7/365 (this year 366.)   I want to know what is going on in y'alls lives or else I wouldn't ask and I wouldn't tell you what is going on in mine. I like to hear about the kids, girlfriends, fuck buddies, whatever, just anything that is going on with you at any given time.  This is when I need y'all the most. I am making a huge decision and am a billion miles away and I   need   your support. Yes, I have made up my mind and yes I am continuing on with my decision, but I still want you to be part of it.  This is what worries me the most... I have no doubt in my mind that ST and I will continue to talk well past the years from now. I have doubts that I will be talking to Mungo, Oldman, and Bubbles. Here is why:  Bubbles - OO does his own thing (which is cool) but just does not want us to know what the hell is going on most of the time. This I know, because you can all admit we have gotten different pieces of puzzles when we talked to him on the phone. Oh, And J doesn't like me.  Mungo - you have the largest heart of all of us. You follow it blindly though most of the time. This in of itself is not always bad, but your heart goes to people without thinking of yourself first. This will mean making sacrafices for that person so they are the cornerstone. This is not bad either. I think the love of your life should be your cornerstone, but should not completely take you out of your happy place. I really don't know if this will make sense to you since I am wondering if it makes sense to me, but I know where my mind is tracking. Bottom line, Think of yourself first to make you happy, then worry about making others happy. Whatever that decision, so be it.  Oldman - Oldman and I have gotten to be pretty good friends over the past 2 assignments. I consider him a friend that I can trust with almost anything. (sorry about the almost, but life is a bitch) He has helped me through shit when I just needed to get my mind off of the stresses in my life even if it meant pissing his wife off upon occasion because I just needed to get the fuck away from M before I or she made my life a living hell. He is there for me now more than ever, however, you are fixing to retire and where that takes you is not totally certain. More than likely it will be northern TX. TX is good, however, it is a hell of a drive from H-Town when I go to visit there.  ST - ST and I are (in my opinion) closer than brothers. He is closer than anyone in my family and this is by choice. You can't choose your family, and trust me, I would not ask for my family to be any different. They are the most wonderful people in the world (with a few fucknuts mixed in, but I accept them anyway) You do choose your friends. We plan on living in the same area of the country (more than likely the same state.) ST is the one who's approval I value the most of any of us. Including mine at sometimes because I tend to be a bit more rash and he has got the level head most the time. Don't get too much of an ego though, you go nuts at stupid shit sometimes too. His wife actually likes me. Why? I don't know, but she does. This plays an important factor since I know what kind of hell it can be on a marriage when the wife does not like your best friend.  Anyway, I am probably way off where I fucking started from in the first place and I have a tee time in 6.5 hours for a golf tournament.  Bro's this was   not   meant to rag on anyone, just pointing out what I foresee in the future. Hopefully this does not happen and I sure as hope it does not happen in the next few years. But we have one that is drifting away from the pack that I am not confident will rejoin the formation without us goat-roping his ass.  Just remember...  YOU MY DAWGS!!!!   Eddie

      Double O knows you're getting married, Eddie.  I told him.  Double O's kid, Lizzy, can say "Mungo."  Sort of.  She can look at pictures of me in a photo album, point at me, and say "Momo."  She also knows me voice...because I CALL DOUBLE O.  Peace and Love, Momo

      SHREK 2  We just got back from taking Ashlee to see her very first movie in the theater. I think that she was more excited about getting her own popcorn than she was about the movie. She sat through the whole thing and had a great time.  The movie is freaking hilarious! If you liked the first Shrek then this one is even better.  ST out

      I wake up this morning (it is yesterday for y'all) and there is no fucking water. The good news is that it is only my dorm that has no water. OK, this is not good news. It sucks monkey balls.  ST, good to hear that your trip went well and Ashlee was good for you. Terrible 2's are fun. Try going through it with a kid like mine though. You have a new respect for fatherhood. Lorelei was pretty good for the most part though. We both have good kids. Must have gotten that from their fathers. No promises on step-kids though, I didn't help to raise her any yet. Juliana sounds like a pretty good kid though. Just a typical 11 yr old.  I wonder what OO's kid is like. I hope she is not like that blood sucking leach of a wife he has.  Does he even know I am getting married? That mutha fucka needs to get his blog on.  Anyway, Fuck it. His loss, not mine.  Peace out  Eddie

      Ford makes a Focus.  Yes, Oldtimer, you should focus. Eddie is a bad influence and one should NEVER take his advice. Okay, his advice is usually good but he just doesn't follow it very often! Then again, I don't follow my advice either...shit...nevermind. Just follow Mungo's advice! There you go. Anytime you need advice, Oldfart, just ask us and we can figure anything out.  Mungo, yes, I agree with the other two. You should make yourself happy on this one. Hillary is just playing games with you even if she doesn't see it. It sounds like having company is the same as dating. A woman will always tell you who she has over visiting unless it is someone that she likes but doesn't want to tell you about it. Date this new woman and see how that goes. New adventures for you.  Eddie will end up getting married in Vegas. Sweet. Let me know when you want to start checking out the honeymoon suites at the hotels.  Beck just walked in with Taco Bell. Later dudes.  ST

      HOME! We got home at about 2230 last night. I will give the quickie version of events and will go on side rants when needed. Get in and hang on because this here is the wildest ride in the bloggerness.  Well, I had a ton of crap written out and looked at it....it is only stuff that I would want to read. So, instead, I will just give a summary.  The trip was a friggin blast! WOO WOO all the way baby. Ashlee was great...for a two year old that throws fits when she doesn't get what she wants. No, really, she was very good and she had a wonderful time.  The Shades of Green Resort was just amazingly pretty and still smelled brand new! The View from the room was wonderful as well.  We all had a wonderful time and I think it was one of the best vacations that I have even been on!  It is really nice to be home and back in the swing of things (or at least trying to get back into the swing). For Memorial Day we are going camping at Zion National park with a bunch of folks...should be a good time as well. No Disney, but it will be fun.  There isn't really anything super crazy that I need to blog about. We went to all four parks, Disneyworld, MGM Studios, Wild Animal Kingdom and Epcot Center. We drove to Tampa one day and to Daytona Beach another day. Ashlee has now walked in the Pacific, Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico...the has the oceans all covered and she is barely two!  Okay, I have to go eat some beffast. Will blog more in a little while.  Oh yeah, Mungo, you have every right to be mad at my ass. I put your number where I wouldn't forget it. When in Fl I tought that I had lost it and searched our luggage for it. On the way home I find it tucked away in my wallet. Sorry dude. I was hoping that you would call but you must have had a busy weekend. Sorry man. Let's firm up when you are going to get over to Vegas! When in Sept?  ST out.

      How is it possible to lose your will to drink beer?  I want to get buzzed (not drunk); just buzzed enough to fill good and forget about the stress in my life. I know that's the wrong reason to drink, so maybe that's why I'm torn.  It's a struggle that so far I'm winning, but I don't know how long I can hold out! It makes it even more difficult wh E n a certain frien D   D oesn't l I k E  being bored and drags me downtown and forces me to take in all the eye candy (scantily clad and oh so hot russian chicks). I won't mention any names though  :P  Other than that things are blah with shades of gray.  I'm outta here...gotta think about drinkin a beer...

      Good to see Ned again. It has been a while.  Hippy chicks are cool. I can remember this one hippy chick that I went to HS with. Her name is Grace. Grace was a straight up hottie. Thinking back on it, I should have dated her. Never did. Timing was bad. I knew she liked me though, but I was hung up on another chick that ended up being my fiance' about a year later.   It is too fucking early here. I have not woken up this early to go to work in about 2 months. Time to drink coffee.  Eddie out

      Hillary and I are in the air.  Please wish me luck in my future.  I am on the verge of reenlistment once again.  I can't seem to clear my head.  No matter what I do.  None of my thoughts have been plain, black and white, straight forward, or real.  With a brain acting like mine is now, it's very hard to make decsions.  ...well, carrying on with my sleepless tradition, I have not slept tonight.  Wait, I take that back, I think I dozed off for 10 minutes around 12:15 a.m.  Then a strange song came on and scared the shit out of me in my sleep.  I haven't slept since.  Wide awake, but in that state where the shaking starts and the bugs come out of my skin.   I saw "Troy" last night.

      9 Hours, eh? Lots of laundry or really slow machines?  Kev and I went out last night. I had a couple Corona's and an OB. The OB tasted like shit, but the Corona's were good. That pretty much did me in for the night.  ST is probably having a blast right now in Dinney World. He should have some interesting blogs when he gets back.  My life is boring right now. I have no real reason to blog other than the page needs more shit on it so we can have a big book.  Here is something though... I have convinced Elena to get married in the US. Unfortunately,this was a topic of debate. I told her I wanted to get married in the states and she was hesitant. She thought it would be easier to get the visa if we were already married. This however is not the truth. It is actually easier to get a fiance visa than it is an alien relative (not like the ones ST works with.) We also talked about Juliana coming over. We both want her to go with, but Juliana was hesitant since she is young and going to a totally different place. This is, however, a better option than staying Russia. I think she is mainly scared because she doesn't really know who the hell I am or what the hell to expect. This is understandable.  So anyway, we will probably get married in Utah or Vegas. I have to see what she will want to do. Vegas is very attractive to people that have not been there before. However, I have been there so fucking much it has no draw to me at this point other than my dawg being there. (Beck and Ashlee too, didn't mean to not include them.)  This will also give us some more time together before we get married. We have up to 90 days to get married when she gets to the US. More time one-on-one is always a good thing. Lets us figure out quirks and see if she can actually put up with my dumb ass.  Lates my peeps

      It took me 9 hours to do all my laundry today.  A Papa John's Pizza, a 2-liter of coke, a slice of carmel cheese cake, three movies, half a Padres/Cubs game, and a several rerun episodes of some 1970's crime drama later... my laundry was finished.  It's now 1:13 a.m. and I have nothing left to do with my day.  15th and broke already, eh, Oldman?  Was one of them Mark Morris by any chance?  Peace and Love, Mungo

      So...Eddie and I walk into the Golden Gate club.  We grab a seat and order our drinks.  Two russian hotties walk in and sit down at the table next to us (the damn devil is tempting us again it think to myself).  One was a tall blonde probably 6 foot, wearing black leather everything...she was damnnnnnn fine in every way.  The other a brunette maybe 5'6, equally proportioned and equally heart-stopping.  Damn. That's all I can say.  Anyways...we're drinkin, takin in the eye candy and I hear this conversation taking place next to our table.  These two dudes are standing in a small crowd next to our table, they're plastered and one says to the other...hey buy me a drink i got no more money.  The other says...sorry man i'm busted too.  Now, this in itself is not all that funny, but just being in Korea and being downtown on a regular basis can make one understand.  The money can go quick!  Too many damn fine chicks and not enough money to go around! I heard this conversation and couldn't hold back the laughter.  Keep in mind this conversation took place on 15 May...yes 1 maybe 2 days after these guys got payed!  Only in Korea!  This is what it's all about. Livin it up in a foreign land...and damn are we havin fun!   Oh, a few minutes after that this hot ass Korean sweety plops down beside me, turns on the smile and introduces herself.  I was game since I had enough drinks in me.  Turns out her name was Bora (not to be confused with boring) she was anything but.  However, when I was approached about 10 minutes later and asked to buy her a juice (I declined).  I had no intention of buying her a drink, I just wanted to talk :)  Did I mention she was really fine? Argggggg!!!  Korea, if you're not conflicted...you will be...it's only a matter of time!

      Eddie, Double O said the same thing.  He said, "Sometimes I wish you'd play the asshole.  You'd be good at it dude, because you're not one.  I think you need to play an asshole this time and just do what makes you happy."  So.  That's 2 of 3 opinions from the people that matter most to me... hellswitit.  When I wake up in the morning/afternoon, I'm driving over to Mel's house and I'm going to drag her out somewhere.  THAT would make me happy.   Time for Mungo to live it up. Time for Mungo to face them.  Peace and Love, The One Who Is About To Live It Up   Song of the day:  Mungocult - "Time To Face Them (Thrice)"

      Mungo... do what you need to do. I got your back. But here are my words for what it's worth. You two are not dating. But you agreed to not see anyone until you saw eachother again to determine if you should be together or apart? This goes back to the "Why?" question. There is no commitment made, but you still won't see anybody else. And from what you said, she is just going out all the time and does not make the commitment to talk to you at the time that you had both set? FUCK THAT!  But, you have always been a better person than I have. I am just an ass for the majority of the time. I do think you need to be selfish sometime. You are always concerned with other people (not a bad thing) but never take the time to make yourself happy.  Anyway, I always got your back.  Peace out

      Hillary and Mungo broke up.  Mungo went on leave to Iowa and made plans for the future.  Mungo also decided that he has spent too much time brooding over failed relationships and he wasn't going over board this time.  So Mungo got interested in Melody White and got jobs in Iowa lined up for October.  Then  Hillary  decided that she wanted to get back with  Mungo , and Mungo made a deal with Hillary.  The deal:  not to make any decisions about each other either way until they could discuss it face to face.  This meant no dating others, and no commiting to one another.  Static flow.  On the day the deal was made, it was 20 days before they would see each other.  8 days later Melody and Mungo went out with some friends and flirting happened.  Then dancing and drinks happened. Then drunkeness happened.  Then Melody invited Mungo to her house.  Mungo remembered Hillary and said "No."  Mungo got home and called Hillary.  BUT!  Hillary can't fucking talk to Mungo about all this because she had "company" waiting for her out on the couch.  Mungo's heart was exploded by Hillary.  Hillary called Mungo the next morning, but Mungo was on his way to work.  Mungo said, "I'll call you at 10 p.m. my time, 7 p.m. your time."  This was agreed.  At work the next night, Mungo and Melody talked and smoothed things out from the night before.  But before anything else is discussed, Melody found out that her father had been diagnosed with Spinal Menengitis and that her only uncle was going to die of psirisics in 3 months, so not much talking was done after she recieved her news.  Which was understandable.  Mungo called Hillary at the appointed time but she was in a dressing room at GAP talking to her friend Phoebe and some guy making bra cracks from the other side of the door.  Hillary talked more to the other two than she talked to Mungo.  Mungo got pissed and said, "Hillary, I'll just talk to you later."  She said, "Okay.  Well.  I won't be home tonight.  I'm going out."  She made no attempt to supply another time.  Mungo said, "Fine."  She said, "Bye."  Mungo hung up.  Mungo got on the Blog and we're all caught up now.  I'm mad.  Really mad.

      Good on ya, Mungo... But why? I thouht that you and Hillary were taking a break. This means you have no commitment towards her and she has none to you. So... why?  Or is the dating thing back on with her and I missed either subtle or flat out obvious clues? You said you were going to hang with her in AK but not bang with her. (I can rhyme too, kinda)  It is way too mutha fuckin early here. I got home at 2300, fell asleep at 0330 and am back up at 0700. Gym time is at 0800. I did not get enough sleep.

I said, "No," because of Hillary and she said, "Well, I can't talk about this right now because I have company."

      I spoke to Double O tonight... er... last night... what ever.  I'm trying to plan my vacation. Sucks that I have to plan my vacation as if it were a TDY, but hey, I want to maximize this time for my friend Timo.  We have two weeks and I want to squeeze in as much adventure as possible.  I want to get him absolutely hooked on the Last Frontier.  I am, and it's only fair that everyone should be so cruelly afflicted.  Double O has some time off and right now it looks like he'd be able to come along on the charter if we can do it on either the 27th or 28th of May OR the 1st of June.  Looking at the 2 week map that I've made, it would probably be best if we could do it on the 27th of May.  That way, Double O and Hillary can come along. Anydangway, that would make five of us, Double O, Hillary, Timo, Mencken, and H-Bach.  27th is my first choice, 28th is a very close 2nd and then the 1st of June is my 3rd choice, but then Hillary probably couldn't come (her father is a fisherman, she knows what it's all about already).  Other days that are open are:  29, 30 May, 5, 6 June... but then neither Double O nor Hillary would be able to attend.  Which is fine, this is Timo's and Mungo's vacation.  I'm really excited about this trip!  Gettin' jittery.  But I'll leave it at that.  I'll script out a good intinerary for y'all before I leave.  To make you jealous.  Anyway, I've decided not to go into work until 1500 today either, and now it's 12:40 so that gives me almost two and half hours before I need to be anywhere.  I think I'm going to go out into town and check on things down that way.  You know, just to make sure they're still around.  By "they" I mean "all the things in town."    I've been working late shifts with Melody all week this week and last week.  We cut up at work and then she flakes after work... she just never shows up.  I guess Shawndra and her work out just fine as roomies.  HOKAY! Peace and Love, Mungo   Song of the day:  The Paradox - "BubbRubb On Dat Booty"

      Unfortunately, I will not be a slut for the near future. I may be able to be a Blogger slut though.  It is raining here. It sucks ass. It will probably rain tomorrow here too.  I am listening to Adam Sandler. I now remember why I like listening to it. Why, you ask? Because it is funny as shit.  Talked to Elena for a few tonight. She was tired so we only talked for about 5 minutes. Her daughters music recital is tomorrow. She said she would send me pictures. I have no idea of what relevance this really has to y'all, but I have nothing else to really talk about so I am just babbling.   I figure that if no one else has blogged in a few hours, that it must be my turn to blog. This is neither logical nor relevant as well.  I learned how to play "Happy Birthday" on the Bass. It is easy as hell and is a good thing to know... I think. Well, at least I can have that in the repatois' (sp? spell check doesn't know either)   By the way, It is 1 am here and I am just sitting around doing jack shit. I don't go to work until 1500 so I figured I would just stay up for a while. I will probably revert to playing the PS2 or the bass.  This was weird... Someone just called me. It was a Ruskie chick and I have no clue who the fuck it was. It was not Elena, I know that anyway. She hung up relatively quickly though. Wrong # I guess. Kinda odd that it just happened to be a Russian chick though.  Anywho, I guess it is time for me to go smoke and then polish the bishop  Here are some other funny ones for you... -spank the monkey -arc the ape -punch the munchkin -lop the lizard -grab the gopher -dangle the dolphin -wallop the whale -beat the meat -yank the yak -ravage the raven There are many more in my mind, however, I will leave you with my all time favorite. It is my favorite because it reminds me of a very interesting mid-shift in AK. It was just one of those nights. Here it is...  Torque the Trout   Dueces... Eddie out

      That was me that said that, not Mungo...  Apparently the new style has made it difficult for ST to comprehend who is writing what.  Flights with 2 year olds are fun and exciting... If all else fails, drug them. Trust me, this can be a good thing.

      I agree with you Mungo that I don't like the way you have to look at another page if you are responding to questions. I do like the over all new look of the blogger site though. Our blog page looked the same as before the switch but I wanted to change up the look since blogger changed theirs. Sign of the times.  Eddie, you have always been able to change the date and time of the blog that you are creating. It was just harder to find in the old blog version. I don't like it because if you create a blog about something that happened a week ago and you date it for a week ago then people might not see it because it won't be at the top.  Not too much going on here. I got home from work this morning and my internet took a dump on me while I was catching up on the blogorama. We are finishing up getting ready to go tomorrow. I am pretty excited for the trip except that I have to be on two flights with a two year old. All will be good...please, Lord, let it all be good!  Beck's Mom is going in to surgery this afternoon. She is going to get some of her insides all tuned up and ready to go again. She will be in the hospital for 3 days then will be at our house for about two weeks to get better. Beck's sister is coming down from Utah to help out while we are in FL.  I will blog more tonight before bed. I may even jump on Yahoo! if I have the time.  ST

      Mungo, my friend, thank you for brining up a failed relationship in context with one that is not very old but going pretty good. I appreciate that.  But to answer your question, Elena (note: spelling) calls me Eddie. And yes, she does know my real name is David. The "Old Man" (our new blogger) told her that.  It is kind of funny how she pronounces it though... there is much emPHASis on the "ie" part of my name. Kinda cute.   The fact that 99% of my friends (exception is one that was my friend in HS) call me Eddie. The ones that don't are usually bosses or idiots because they keep calling me Dave or David after I have told them to call me Eddie. Most of them fall into the boss catagory though.  Did you know that you can change the "Blog Post Time" on the new system? I just found that out under the "More Post Options" tab. No worries, I don't plan on fucking with the blog times.  Anyway, yes, she calls me Eddie.  Eddie out

      Any new developments with you and Elana?  Also, does she call you David and insist that everyone else calls you that too?  I remember someone else who hated it when people called you Eddie...  Peace and Love, Mungo

      I just finished a 4 mile run/walk.  I completed it in 47 minutes and 15 seconds.  Pretty crappy, but i'm going to try to do it at least once a week (I'd prefer twice) until I leave Florida.  I don't have any goals other than to see the time drop a bit every time.  Now I gotta go-a-shrower up and get back to work.  As for the new Blog design, I think it's grood.  I mean Good.  And Great. Great and good.  Peace and Love, Mungo   Song of the day:  Metallica - "Through the Never"

       Dudes line up on my right for high-fives."  Hillary and I chatted for two hours tonight.  In fact, I got back from our payphone a few moments ago.  (It's at the Smile Line on the corner of Ivy Road and Tyndall Parkway.)  Not sure where things are heading with us, but it's obvious we both miss each other.  We have agreed to see each other when I go on my leave to AlAskA in two weeks, but other than that, there have been no promises and there have been no assumptions.  I'll tell y'all this much, I'm kinda nervous about the whole deal, deep inside I want nobody but her.  I don't seem to get tired of her.  As far as the thing with Mel goes... it felt good to have a face to face heart to heart with someone.  And the fact that she's drop dead gorgeous didn't hurt things, neither did the heavy flirting... but the most important part was that somebody was listening to me.  Sure, there may have been a slight pretense, but that is one hell of an exciting feeling:  And you all know what I mean.  It's that new car smell wrapped up in a girl.  It's the unknown, the new waters.  And when you're at that stage, that awkward stage where there are no existing  problems , where you can invent a persona, there doesn't seem to be any limits.  It's all bullshit, true, but for those few hours it's really nice.  It's comfortable and uncomfortable at the same time, where the dichotomy of emotions don't wear you out, they energize you and excite you.  But it's all bullshit.  When I talk to Hillary there is warmth.  There is trust.  There is, yes, love.  And that is more important than any fleeting feeling.  I miss Hillary and I love her.  We're not together right now, but a side of me (one of eight) is ever hopeful that things will return to the way they were, only stronger.  But if I expect that to ever happen, I have to move to AlAskA as soon as possible.  Absence may make the heart grow fonder, but distance allows the heart to wander.  (I made that one up, you can quote me.)  I have a JSS job offer at Elemndorf that starts at $45K.  Should I submit a resume, or is a civilian contracting jobola too close to the Military I'm trying to separate myself from?

      When I jumped on the bloggie I instantly liked the new look of the main pages. There are many new templates to choose from so I thought that I would update our page as well. What do you think of the look? I dig it but if there is mass revolt then I can change it...it will take a total revolt though!  I am off to look for more new features. I think that I can put a little picture of to the left as well so we will have to come up with a picture.  ST out.

      Ashlee let us sleep in until 0715 this morning...woo hoo! We jumped up took the dog for a walk around the block then decided we wanted some Starbucks. Threw the dog in the back of the truck and headed out to SB. Me: coffee, Beck: hot chocolate and Ashlee: chocolate milk. We dropped the dog off at the vet for a bath and nail trim (he is still there). When we got home I sprayed bug poison all around the outside of the house to kill the black widows and roaches that will be wanting to come in from the heat soon. I took a shower then vacuumed the whole house after which I proceeded to dust the whole house. I ate a piece of lemon cake for lunch and I am now blogging at 1330. Speaking of which...it is about time to go get the dog from the vet.  Oh yeah and since it is mother's day I did give Beck her presents when we woke up. Three candle holders and a heart shaped necklace. It has been a busy day.  Yesterday, we went to a going away BBQ for one of the guys from my shop. It was an okay time. Beck and I just hung out and watched Ashlee play on all the kids equipment. The person that was throwing the BBQ has a home day care so it was like a park for little kids in the backyard.   Okay, I am actually going to go and get the dog now. Later guys.  WELCOME KEVIN! Blog on brother.  ST out.

      Kevin has now been invited to our blog. Lets hope he does not turn out to be another OO.  Talking with ST was good. He pointed out the things that I had been thinking of. I thought more of them. It was just good to actually hear him say it.  I think that he will like Elena. She is definately a blast to be around. Camping trips will be fun. ST, Beck, Ashlee, Me, Elena, Lorelei and Juliana. I am seeing a very packed trailer. Elena and I get the couch. Juliana can sleep on the top bunk and the other 2 can have the bottom bunk or the table. ST and Beck, of course, get the master suite... he he he. But the couch is mine and nobody will take it away from me or they will get shot.   Dudes... this is gonna be a fun ride....  Eddie

      Well, I am sitting here talking with Eddie about getting married. Of course he has lost his mind but that is besides the point right now.  Okay, I am behind him all the way. I understand that he has to make his own decision about this. He knows my concerns and undstands where I am coming from. If this is going to make him happy then it is the right thing to do.  I AM HAPPY FOR YOU! WOO WOO!  ST out

      I don't think that hurrying is a huge option. Lots of paperwork involved.  I shot pool last night too. My game was extremely off though. Could not sink shit.  Kevin asked if he could join our blog. This I think needs a 3/4ths vote in order to pass. (OO doesn't get much say, seeming how his bitch ass ain't ever on here.) If no is the answer, then so be it. No biggy to me.  I am still waiting to see what ST is going to say. He has sent me an e-mail and an IM but has not posted anything on the blog or made comments through other means about it. This worries me.  In other words, I am basically waiting for the BVR bitch-slap from him.

      I've been out at St. Andrew's Bay all day, hey, what can I say?  I manned an Aid Booth for the triathalon.  That was a blast, got lots of sun (I'm all red and brown).  I'm probably going to the beach tomorrow for some sun again... but now, I'm going to bed.  Tim and I stayed out until 3:30 a.m. drinking 10 pitchers of beer and shooting 20 games of pool.  I won, 11-9, but I'm still behind in the long run, 57-53.  Pretty tired now, I've been up since 6:20 a.m.  Peace and Love, Mungo

      I've asked two girls to marry me, two of them said yes, then two of them said no.  I've "fallen in love" way too many times to count.  I'm not going to sit here and say, "Well, I only thought I was in love," because that is just a cop-out.  When you love someone you know it.  But that's all you know.  You don't know the future, and though you trust the person you love, you don't KNOW their heart.  All you can do is trust that the person you're with is being honest first with themselves, and then with you... and that comes from guarding each other's hearts (do you know what I mean by that?).  There are no guarantees in life, but that's what makes life interesting, scary, fun, and fulfilling.  Honestly, the reason I can keep on going with women is because I have learned that someone, out of nowhere, and at any time, can touch your life deeply, it just may not always happen with the best of circumstances (DISTANCE!).  Eddie, you're 100% right.  We will always be at your back no matter what.  But when a woman is involved, we'll leave the KY at home... that's her job then.  We can't help but to be a little jealous, but hey, thems the breaks.  MUNGO'S ONE LINE OF ADVICE:  Don't be in a huge hurry to merge your futures.  Think.  Pray.  Decide.  Good luck, Eddie.  I'm glad you let us in on that.   Keep on Tranglin' Mungo   Song of the Day:  The Mull Historical Society - "Instead"

      Mungo, you are just a bit disturbed. I am sure that you already know that but I just want to re-confirm it. I hope you don't plan on entertaining anyone or having a girlie friend over for dinner. HA.  All is well with me. I went shopping for Mother's day today. We took the women out to a buffet (their choice so back off!) for dinner. It is hot here but by next week it should cool down a bit with a cold front coming in off the west coast.  Orlando weather is looking pretty good for our trip. I am looking forward to that soooo much. Not looking forward to the flights though...yuck.  ST out

      OK, dude... I can understand most of the shit you got rid of. But why on the dishes and silverware. Someone walks in your place and you have only 1 plate and 1 fork, you are going to look like a fucking hermit. Don't you ever have people over to eat or anything?  I myself can tell you pretty much what I have just by looking around me in my one room pad.   TV 2 computers (Laptop & Desktop) 2 camera's (The Elph and the Digital) a PS2 a phone w/ ans machine Bose entertainment system Bass Guitar w/ amp Sonicare Tooffer brush Braun self-cleaning razor Golf Clubs  That pretty much sums up anything of value in my room.  The only other things I own, Miranda has right now  2 Tables Entertainment Center Dresser Inflatable mattress (it has 3 tiers)  This is obviously with the exception of my arsenal at ST's house along with my car.  I am going to be getting a place and not having shit in it when I get to Utah. But my guns will be there.  OK, I am hesitant telling this to y'all because I already know the reaction that I will get...   Dudes... Elena asked me to marry her. Yes, Yes, I know what you are thinking now. And yes I have thought about those things as well. This includes the getting to the US to get out of Russia, the Damn mutha fucka you just got a divorce, and the I thought you were not ready for commitment, the logistics, and probably everything else. Lots of shit has gone through my mind. And all the answers are not there yet. Most of them, however, are.  Here is the deallyo. ST caught on that I liked her more than I eluded to. Mungo probably had the feeling, but had his own woman issues to deal with. Bubbles was probably oblivious for 2 reasons, he doesn's check the fucking Blog and he just stays in his own happy land most the time anyway.  Dudes, I love this chick. It was going DAMN well when it got abruptly stopped. I talk to her often on the phone still.  I am debating whether to post and publish right now, just because I don't know if I want to know the reaction. I know that my Bro's are always willing to support my decisions no matter how off the wall they may be. I know this because you 3 are closer than my own family is to me. However, don't be gentile. Tell me what you think.  By the way... I said yes.

      Eddie:  I can play "Come As You Are" on my acoustic guitar... but it sounds stupid because I'm trying to play the base line. Mike:  A belated HAPPY BIRTHDAY to Ashlee.  AOBTW, the video is mega jerky when I view it.  The screen updates only once every 15 seconds, the WOO WOO audio is clear as a bell though!  To address the question:   "So Mungo, What did you post before on the POS apple?"  I answer something like this -- I went back out to the one lane bridge in the country that night, it was 12midnight. (Directions:  depart Osage on Hwy 9, take exit for the first town, drive through to the other end of that town to the only stop sign, turn right on T-64, drive 15 or 20 minutes until you see the carpet sign in the cow field and turn left on B-33, cross the Little Cedar River and turn right on the next gravel road, pull off onto the grass before the bridge, and read on to find out what happened there)  I walked out to the bridge (crossing the Little Cedar River again) and took some deep breaths.  Memories flooded in through each breath I inhaled.  It was a remembrance vacuum night.  The moon and his little dotty friends were the only things up in the sky.  They had things to remember of their own.  I smoked.  Then I went to my car, got my camera, attached it to my new tripod, loaded a 400 ISO roll of Kodak color film inside, and took 24 timed-exposured pictures of the bridge.  When that excitement was over done with through , I put my camera and tripod in the back seat, turned everything off, and walked back to the center of the bridge.  I climbed up on one of the rails, climbed down below the bridge and sat over the river on an i-beam.  I peed.  I smoked.  I remembered so many things about Jill.  Until that night I had forgotten about THE ROPE.  ( the rope:  Jill's brother Ryan Alexander Westergard [raw] had afixed a 5 lb hook to the end of a yellow nylon tow rope.  We would fasten the hook to the edge of the bridge, throw the rope over, and climb down the frozen river below and do things down there.  We camped in the snow once, we even drove stakes into the ice!  When we were done on the river, we would climb the rope and walk back to her house ).  Then I climbed the dusty beams to the lane of the bridge, and decided to go higher. I climbed to the top of the arch over head.  I laid down on my back and starred unblinkingly at the stars, and the waning moon said to me, "It is another evening in God's world."  I remembered Jill Alexandria Westergard [jaw] and what she meant to me.  I smoked.  I talked to her.  I said, "Revolutions do not happen on buffet tables, they happen in the reverse undertow, they happen on one-lane bridges."  Then I sat up.  Then, as that wild hair started to tickle me, I stood to my feet.  Standing there on top of the bridge arcs, looking up and down from the Little Cedar River 60 feet down and up to Great Luna 230,600 miles above me, I began crying.  Like a baby.  It was the first time I cried for her.  I could really feel her there, and she seemed to say, "Erik, you dumbass, before you loose your balance staring at the moon with watery eyes, maybe you should sit down... that water isn't deep enough to break your fall."  So I sat down... for a very long time.  I smoked several more cigarettes and wrote A POEM.  ( a poem:  You walk in slow motion And burned by the fire When your path of devotion Is a path of desire.  Slow motion resonation mumble Slow motion destination trouble. )  After all that, I carefully climbed off the bridge, returned to my car, and drove to Charles City, Iowa (8 miles away).  I rolled into the dead dead town and found the only place open... a filling station.  I told elaborate lies to the lady behind the counter and drove back to Osage taking the long way.  I jumped on the computer at 4:30 a.m., tried to Blog about the night, and lost it all.  Now you know.  And lastly, Mel isn't going to come over tonight.  This is a long story.  It's not all as nice as it seems.  This is a problem, and his name is Jason.  Jason is not an ass and there is nothing wrong with him... except that he's in love with Mel, and they work together at the same desk.  They have some things to discuss.  Mel and I are throwing a wine/lasagna/cheese/cracker party at her house on Friday.  Only Shawndra, my friends Jenn and Tim, Mel and I will be there.  It will be a good time.  On Saturday I will be at St. Andrew's Bay to man an aid station for the Florida Triatholon.  Then, that night, I'll be going to our squadron's Combat Dining In.  I'm guaranteed to be one tired mofrappe that night, but I think I'm going to ask Mel to go to a movie with me anyway.  Sunday I will sleep all fwigging day.

      Sweet. Mungo's got a new girl. Always good to spice things up a bit. Just don't get her pregnant, but you can practice and that is still cool.  Playing Tarzan, eh?

      Oh, Melody.  Right. I'm home now, on lunch, at 6:03 p.m.  I'm headed back to work tonight, workin' this swing shiftola.  Mel is working late tonight as well.  She's coming over after work tonight.  I do like her.  Yes.  This is true.  She may like me on some level too, and it's kind of exciting.  But you're right, I am going to say, We're Just Friends.  Because that's what we are.  I don't want to get involved with someone this close to me leaving.  I... probably.... will though.  I worked in the woods for 4 hours today!  I'm cut and scratched to hell.  I haven't looked like this since after the Bird Ridge Memorial Day bike ride!  I was pulling 100 foot thorny vines out of trees.  Talk about hard work.  I got to play Tarzan for a while though, I actually swung from one tree to another.  That was cool as hell.

      Home now.  We talked for hours.  We curled up on the couch and just talked and talked and talked our little hearts out.  We poured so much of our hearts out...man, it has been a long time since I've been so open with somebody, it was fantastic.  We're both working late again tomorrow and after work, around 11 or so, she's coming over to my place for some more talkage.  That will be good.  So refreshing.  She made me happier tonight than I have been in a while.  Seriously, our four hour talk did more good for me than my 9 days off of work last weekish.  Pretty amazing.  I'll shut up now.

And she's gorgeous.  She has invited me over and it's almost 11p.m.  I'm not so certain where this is leading, but it's a bit confusing with all these thoughts of Hillary runnin' through my head.  I, of course, will be going over there anyway.  Perhaps I'll post an update in a few hours.  Perhaps tomorrow morning.  We shall see.

      Your car is not the brown cow. Dusty but not brown. Nope, no gas yet. Taking her to work on Thur for my ovn so I will gasser up on Fri just to put some fresh petrol in her.  I still laugh out loud about the woo woo!. Beck thinks I am nuts. I just think that it is the funniest thing I have seen in one hell of a long time. I like it when he goes speeding off and almost hits a parked car right before he blows through the stop sign. Well, WOO WOO mutha fucka! WOO WOO!  ST

      It is hovering in the mid 60's here right now creeping on the 70's. Spiders are starting to come out and everything is getting very green.  I am DJing tonight at "Your Club." Should be fun.  ST, I don't want to come back to a suprise WOO WOO on my car. That would not be cool. Funny as hell, until I got sick of the WOO WOO and then I would just rip my muffler off. I had a dream about mufflers last night... go figure. Suggestive dreaming.  Speaking of my car, did you put gas in her yet? Is she still a pretty silver or is she now brown?  So Mungo, What did you post before on the POS apple?

      Mr. Sunny is starting to wake up and show his face here in the land of idiots. What happens here stays here...what a slogan for tourists! Geez.   I digress. My whole point is that the heat is on. Today should be about 97 degrees. Time to cook it up.  Speaking of cooking. Yesterday we had Ashlee's birthday party. We had our neighbors over and some other people. What a good time! Grilled up some burgers, hot dogs and some brats...yummy stuff, man. Ashlee had a great time playing with the kids all day in her new play house. That damn playhouse is nicer then my first apartment!  I think I am going to go riding now....bye.  ST

      Still working on playing the bass. It is going pretty well, but my fingers are still sore and I try to play at least 2 hours a day. I am just doing basic things and trying to do easy bass lines from different songs. I am having a blast with it, but it is very frustrating when I fuck up. So I am frustrated a lot, needless to say.  Tell Mom I said hi. I hope she is having fun with Ashlee. I know the only time my mom came to visit me was after I had a kid. Gotta love the draw that the first grandkid has.  Dinney Land is almost here for y'all and I am still stuck in the Big K wanting to go. Ah well, such is life.  Where the fuck  did  OO go? Man, that mutha fucka need to be bloggin, yo.  I am still talking to Elena on the phone (um, obviously on the phone, kinda hard to talk otherwise... thank you Capt Obvious.) Damn, I still miss that chick. I got to hear her kid play the piano. It was probably Tchaikovsky or Scriabin or something like that. It sounded pretty good, or as good as it could through a phone.  Am I more fucked up than I think I am or am I just glutten to put myself in those situations?  Dueces....

      Blog on!  I have been slow on the blog action lately. We have family in town so my computer gets turned off at night so they aren't sleeping in a vortex. When morning rolls around I am just too lazy to turn it back on. So  here I am on Sunday morning.  Yes, Eddie, you are pretty messed up. But that is not new to us and we still have love for the messed up brother.  Mungo is probably getting his head together from his trippy to land befor time.  007...well, he really is just screwed up and never gets on here.   My Mom got into town yesterday so she is having a blast with Ashlee. "Hi, Mom! Here is the kid. Beck and I are going riding on the quads...be back in a few days!" Okay, not really. It is nice to see Mom again though.  We had a yard sale yesterday and made about $75. Nevermind that the stuff we sold was worth over $200.  Oh well, the crap was just sitting around the house collecting dust anyway so at least it is gone. We gave a crap load of clothes to the Goodwill afterwards.  I found a picture of Mungo and I from AK. It is cool stuff and I want to mess with it on the computer before I send out some copies.  I am taking Mon (tomorrow) off for my b-day comp day. I work on Tue then I am taking leave on Wed. I overnight on Thurs then have most of Fri off. I overnight on Mon then have Tue to pack our bags. Wed morning we are off to FL! Woo hoo! Mungo is meeting us at the happiest place on earth so I get to see a bro!  Okay...I am off to do family stuff. We are having a BBQ/party for Ashlee's b-day (actually on 4May). Going to grill up some brats, dogs and burgers...yummy stuff, dudes.  ST out

      OK... So I blog my ass off and nobody responds back. What the hell bro's? Are we contemplating how fucked up Eddie really is?  Anyway, I splurged yesterday. I bought a bass guitar. I am slowly learning and my left hand and fingers hurt a tad bit. But, it is a lot of fun. I am having a good time with it and can play most of " Come as You Are " by Nirvana. Though it is very easy too.  Later  Eddie

      I spend more time planning and getting ready for camping that I do camping! It's worth it though. Camping pretty much rocks.  Trailer is loaded up and just about ready to go. Quads are in and just waiting.  We don't really know where we are going yet. We are going up to UT somewhere near the Paiute ATV trail (1000's of miles of trails, literally). Our plan is to explore some of the dirt roads in the area and find a spot off in the woods to camp. No campgrounds here baby! Total dry camping/boondocking/dispersed camping...whatever you want to call it. If we don't take it then we don't have it.  We are probably leaving 0400 Fri. Joy.  ST out.

      This Thur night we are off to go camping for the 4th of July. Thur night until Monday. We are going up to Strawberry (Eddie knows about the Strawberry action). This time we will be staying up in the trees and totally self contained. Yes, quads will be ridden and the air will sink with fun! Tree huggers can lick my nuts!

      Mungo, all I can say is have fun.   I hate Korea, but at least no one can say that I am not having a good time overall. Because, I am having some kick ass times here. Granted I would rather be hanging with the bro's having a kick ass time, but that aint possible at this time.  Oldshit is here though. We have kick ass times on quite a few occassions with more to come I am sure.  Don't worry about poluting the water. Remember the MS river flows into the gulf. Fucking tree hugger.

          Bro's and ho's,     I'm going jet skiing tonight for the first time in my life.&nbsp; I'm really not looking forward to adding to the polution of the great southern waterways (I really am concerned about these things), but I am excited to be trying something new.&nbsp; I rode a 4 wheeler once.&nbsp; The trip lasted 30 seconds.&nbsp; I didn't know where the breaks were so I paniced and ran face first into a tree.&nbsp; I was close-lined and I fell to the ground leaving the 4 wheeler to come to a natural stop, destroying a headlamp and the brushgard.&nbsp; That was my last off road motorized vehical experinance.&nbsp; I was 12 years old.      Peace and Love,    Mungo       PS...Wish me luck.&nbsp; This could be crazygonuts.        Song of the day:&nbsp; Neutral Milk Hotel - &quot;Oh, Comely&quot;

      Gentlemen of the Blogginz:  I have met another love of my life.  I'm such a lucky man to have so many lovely women in my life, huh?  This one is Gretchen Johansson.  She's from Stockholm.  I met her in Fort Walden Beach this weekend.  I was out there with Kevin Swiadek and Tommy Haycraft.  I talked to her for three hours over some drinks.  Unfortunately, the more she drank, the harder it was for her to "think" in English, therefore, her speech was far more degraded.  But smiling and dancing and touching made up for a lot of the language barrier.  The Bad News.  She was there, at the beachside bar, with her Swedish host family and they were not about to let her too far out of their sight.  I guess I can understand that.  She's only got two more weeks in the USA and then it's home again to Stockholm.  She gave me her phone number to her home in Sweden (a lot of good that will do me) and I gave her mine in Panama City.  Perhaps she'll call.  Likely she won't.  The Good News.  Even if I never speak to her again, meeting someone, talking, and feeling those new sparks again made me feel a whole lot better about women.  I had a pretty poor view there this last week.  I haven't been able to fix my computer, so I have no idea what's going on with the blog.  If someone could e-mail me at work to let me know that this address actually does work for remote posting, that would be sweet.  Thanks for all your support during this revolutionary campign.  Peace and Love, Mungo

      I just sprayed the shit out of some weeds. Tell you what! Should be dead by this time tomorrow. DIE YOU COMMIE WEED BASTARDS!  This has been an uneventful Saturday. I have basically spent the day just relaxing and screwing off on the computer. Beck and Ashlee come home tomorrow. I can't wait to see em.  Ashlee's potty training is going well. Since she has been in UT she has only had one accident. She tells Beck when she needs to go. WOO WOO. Looking back at me 2-3 years ago I would never have thought potty training would be such a big deal to me. Times change.  ST

Malls are boring. I don't want to spend much money. No movies.  Yep, I will sit here on my computer.  Hope you guys are having fun. Mungo needs to get his crap fixed up!

I fixed Beck's bike and it is up and running again as well.  I can't wait for Mungo and Bubbles to get here so I can show them around the mountains behind our house. Eddie, I can only hope the construction doesn't take over by the time you get here. Unfortuneately, I don't think I will be able to ride from the house for much longer.

      If you email your blog in it will post it to the blogger site but the blog won't be published until someone actually goes to the site and publishes a blog. At least you can get you thoughts out there and it will be published next time anyone blogs online.  Mungo, your first blog via email didn't show up and I tried to edit it to get it to publish (before I knew what I was doing). You should go and edit it so it will show under your name and not mine. Sorry about that.  Okay, email bloggies are working.  ST

      Hello gentleman.&nbsp; I was late to work today, about 15-20 minutes late.&nbsp; I woke up 10 minutes before I was supposed to be here.&nbsp; I didn't care.&nbsp; I couldn't sleep last night, I was up until 3 a.m. thinking about money and about  something else .&nbsp; Around 2 a.m. I actually got up, went to my computer and added up how much money I should make between now and 01Sep and subtracted all that I should have to pay in bills and then figured out how much I'll have to pay in gas from here to AK, money for food, and cashola I'll have to shell out to get my car fixed up.&nbsp; I'll be left with a little money, enough keep up on my regular car payments for a few months and enough to live on for a little while once I'm in AlAsKA... but it's not going to be much.&nbsp; I will have to spend next to NOTHING between now and then.&nbsp; No more movie nights.&nbsp; No more going out to eat.&nbsp; No more money fun.&nbsp; It will all have to be about the free fun.&nbsp; Like reading.&nbsp; Like walking, and riding.Peace and Love

      I am a father so today is my day. I am not doing anything for my day.   We did pick up a new (to us) TV today. Beck's friend is moving to FL and is selling everything she owns. She sold us a 32 inch Toshiba TV that is only 2 years old for $30! WOO WOO. The only downside it that the lady is a smoker and the TV reeks (good reason not to smoke inside). Hopefully the smell will go away.  ST

      Today is Friday...Woo Woooo.  Today didn't start out like a Friday at all. At about 0700 I had to go to get my waist measured for the good ole Air Force. I had been sitting around drinking coffee and had not eaten breakfast. The guy asked (he works with me) if I just want to get the sit-ups and push-ups done now so if I don't do well I can do them again on Mon when we run (good deal). The minute I started doing the sits I knew that I had made a big mistake. The coffee started grumbling. I could only do 33. Then I moved on to the pushies. 29. Right about then I wasn't feeling too hot. Actually, I was sweating bullets, cold as a popsicle, and the world was dancing. Yeah, I ended up doing the puke da puke for about 10 minutes. Hey, at least I made it to the puking room. About 3 hours later I felt better and Friday became good.  That is my story. Now I have to do the run in 13min and 30 sec to get a good. We will see.

      Spinner!  Cheater!  Liar!  Average Blog Booster!  ---all terrible things to call another person.  15Sep - 2Oct is much better than I thought we'd have.  I'm hoping we can spend perhaps 10 days in and around Vegas with Mikey.  We'll have 17!   I'm in my boxers, teeshirt and socks.  I have to be AT work in 23 minutes.  Last night a guy who is getting kicked out of the Air Force for alcohol abuse was at my house abusing alcohol.  He disappeared for a while and came back later talking some crazy shit.  He had lost his BDU hat, blouse and a sling for his already dislocated arm.  He didn't remember what had happened but he was covered in grass and he know he kicked someone's ass.  I called the First Sergeant.  I'm very interested in seeing what comes of this.  Peace and Love, mungo  Song of the day:  Mungocult - "Average Posts Per Week"

      So, I was looking at profiles. The average Post per week is as follows...  ST & Mungo - 6  Me - 4  OO & Oldman - 0  I think I see issues with this. We just don't fucking blog enough.  Mungo, I made the drive from AK to FL in 5.5 days. Yes, I was pushing the limits each time and I had a sports car (meaning I drove real fucking fast) but usually I kept it around 80. But you should be able to do around 800 miles a day between 2 people without a problem.  My math comes up with around 4.25 days. take a hundred off that, and y9ou have around 5 days driving. Trust me, the scenery is nice around a lot of areas, but it aint nothing to sit and gaze at for hours on end. Unless you spend 2 days in Vancouver like ST, myself and Greg did because we liked getting drunk there and cute chicks were everywhere. We also got a pretty smokin' deal on a hotel for 3 people.   Damn, that shit brings back some memories. Dudes. We all just need to get together in about 2 years and cruise around with ST's 5th wheel. We all chip in for gas and find camping grounds along the way for about 7-10 days. Staying at each place 1 night and pressing out each morning around 1100. a few hours driving and we are at another campground. That would fuckin ROCK!!  Anywho... I am off to bed.  Later Bro's  Eddie

      5 or 6 days in Vegas and you should still have time to have a leisurely drive to AK.  ST

      You do make a very damn good point, don't you...  When a guy like me can drive 1600 miles in a single sitting, taking 10 days to make that trip seems pretty silly, eh?  Eh.  Time to talk to the bubble maker.  Mungo

      4 days in Vegas = 10 days driving.  3380 miles to AK / 10 days = 338 miles a day.  338 miles a day / 65 miles per hour = 5.2 hours of driving per day.  5 hours of driving = 19 hours of not driving  19 hours of not driving - 8 hours of sleep = 11 hours of free time   So approximately...  50 hours of driving 110 hours of free time 80 hours of sleeping

      Eddie, I don't want you to think that I really have a choice in how much time I spend in Vegas.  Mike, you either.  I don't want anybody thinking that this time means any less to me than it does to y'all.  If I had it my way, we'd be spending two or three weeks in Vegas.  Shit, if I really had it my way, the four of us would all be living in the same place again.  I can't think of anything better than that.  But that's not the situation.  Double O only has a total of 14 days.  How long does it take to drive to AlAskA from Vegas?  At least a week, right.  He's got two jobs that he can't afford to lose because he can't make it back from vacation.  That's the cold hard truth.  We have to consider that.  The extra time I want to spend with my family is like free time anyway.  That has nothing to do with how much time I'll be able to spend in Vegas because Double O is pushing his two weeks back a week.  If it wasn't free time for me, Eddie, I agree with you completely.  I've spent so much more money on going to see my family than they have on coming to see me.  The only reason they ever visited at all is because they always wanted to see AlAskA.  Now, AlAskA is a great reason to take a vacation, but I was more of an afterthought.  Has a SINGLE member of my family even kicked around the idea of coming to visit me in Panama City?  Hell no.  That pisses me off too.  Peace and Love, Mungo   Song of the day:  Josh Jopplin Group - "I've Changed"

      Dudes, let me tell you this... I am glad that I am not going on leave to the US. This is why... If I had been told that I would only be able to hang with the bro's for 4 fucking days when I flew half-way around the world, I would have been pissed off till no end. I would have said Fuck y'all, I ain't doin it. 4 Days?? come on. How often do we actually see eachother? I understand family time. Trust me I do.   But I have come to this realization, they can come and see me.   I am regressing back to the childhood on this one. My mom always had to be the one to travel lengthy distances for us to see family. There were no other relatives with little kids at this time, so it would have been easier for them to come see us.   I am now in a position where I have a wee one and people want to see her. Good for them, come see her then. That is the only reason that most people want to visit anyway. Yes, they enjoy spending time with me, but the get to see Lorelei and that is the big factor.  Fuck that shit. For family, you want to see me, make the fucking effort. I am not the one that needs to put out the cash to come see you. For my bro's? In a heartbeat if it meant it was going to be a long while before I see you again. Family doesn't change, they will always be family and they will always be there for you if you are a good family. I am the same way with the fam. Friends are chosen. You can stop being friends without ever telling them that you are not there for them anymore.  Enough on that rant because I am not coming to the US for my mid-tour anyway. I am going to some place where I have always wanted to go. Granted it is not Moscow, but Khaborovsk will do. It is seeing the "real" Russia.  Remember this though... When have you ever had a bad time hanging with the bro's? I can't think of one time. I would pass up sightseeing in a heartbeat to hang with my bro's as much as could. Fuck sightseeing, I would rather see my bro's.  So anyway, I have had 2 interesting days in a row.   Yesterday was the first time I have ever taken the radios from a student. This absolutely crushe the confidence level. He was not doing bad overall. It was just too much for him at one point and he froze up. It happens. Most of the other controllers in the squadron probably would have fucked it up too.  Then, today, I SNPed (Student Non Progression) the same person. This is the first time I have ever done that as well. This was a safety of flight issue. No way around that one, you fuck that up, you get hooked.  Another trainee, yesterday, would have been my first hook, but passed it by a technicality. He had a break in training and basically started over. What is fucked up about this is that the fuy has been controlling since '95. That is longer than I have been in the AF!!! This guy sucks ass at controlling. Am I the best controller ever? No. But I am up there on the scale. This guy should be way beyond my level but it was like having a brand new WD on scope. Man, I hate incompetance.  Anyway, I think I am done for now.  Eddie

      I just talked to Julie.  Double O is working at his second job.  He's a waiter now.  I can't garuntee that he'll be in full agreement to this, but when I talked to him last week he felt good about pushing it back a week so I could see my family.  How does 14Sep sound?  Sounds pretty good to me.  We'll have a total of two weeks, and hopefully we'll have more than four days to spend in Vegas.  Double O has it in his head that driving to Baja California, Yosemite, Hoover Dam, and Niagra Falls are do-able in two weeks.  I told him he needs to consult a map and common sense!  He was joking about Niagra Falls.  I want to drive 100 miles away from home and lose all my keys I want to return rental movies fast forwarded to the end and pay the late fees  Peace and Love, Mungo   Song of the day:  Mungocult - "High as Low"

      4 days of wonder here in Vegas? That's all? 4 little days? 96 hours? 5760 minutes? 345600 seconds?  007 should try to figure out what he wants to do since he has never been here before and four days is barely enough time to see the sights here in town much less go camping or something. Also, I need a sort of a budget. How much moola is everyone going to have to gamble away or do whatever with? I just want to have an idea.  If at all possible let's try and get this firmed up soon. I am sure that this is not likely but a guy can hope, right? I have a whole month of plans hinging on what you guys decide to do. If I don't get leave in soon then I may not be able to get it if someone else puts in for the time that you decide to come out.  I am going now...I am just going to get myself irritated.

      Hello my Blogginz Brothers!  Life is busy here in Floory Da.  Yes, sirs, tis be true.  So here be me and it is finally time to update chall on the haps of the last.  Okeeday.  Timo and Mungo (that is I, Erik) went to AlAskA, right?  Remember that?  Sure sure.   Here's the recap the one and only blog I posted: We were delayed in Atlanta which kept us from making our connection in SLC to Anchorage.  Bummer, yes yes.  A 10-hour bummer of a layover.  So, instead of making it to Anchorage at 1423, we didn't make it in until after midnight.  So sux.  But we made it.  Double Osph had to work the next morning at 0630 so instead of him going to bed, we hit up VI and did a Jones run with Tony Bermudez.  Sweetness, sirs.  By the time that was all done over with and through it was time for Bubbles to head off to NAC.  So.  What to do?  That was the question Timo and I asked ourselves.  It was about 0600 and we had been traveling since 0400 the day before.  We weren't tired at all.  So we hiked to the top of Flat Top.  Timo didn't bring his camera because it was megacloudy and I didn't bring my camera because I wanted to bring my video camera.  So I vigo-documented the hike to the top.  It was the most beautiful I had ever seen the mountain.  We ended up breaking through a cloud layer and were were sandwiched inbetween the one we climbed through and another at about 3K.  Sweet.  We hung out at the top, sitting on the the edges of the back side and looked over the precipice and did the vigo.  (Lady Astro does the Vigo.)  We climbed back down and mashed around town, hitting up REI and the Sportsmen's Warehouse to pick up supplies for the next three days we were planning in the woods.  Double Osph got off work at 1430 and we were off into the wilds.  We camped the first night near Sterling.  We had smores and I taped Double O making a mess of them... in typical Double style.  It was sweet.  The next day we went to Rainbow Lake and got some really cool pictures and had a snowball fight.  The trail we were going to hike the next two days was the Upper Russian Lakes Trail, but both the bridges were out on the trail and we didn't feel like fording a fast flooded river.  So we went to Dairy Queen instead.  And then we went to resurrection Pass and hiked 4 miles into the water fall.  I video taped and Timo took pictures.  We were going to camp at Russian River, but the whole place was closed because of construction.  Somehow flooding waters undercut a bank and caused a landslide, so they were trying to fix it.  So we went back up towards Portage and the further we got in the worse the weather got and we finally just went back to anchorage.  Too much wind and rain and cold air for camping.  We hung out at Double O's that night and the next morning we went to Dark Globe for a mountain climbin' day, but the the fwiggin' weather was pretty crappy again and we only got half way up before we decided to go back down.  We were out of shelter and the wind was FIERCE!  So we wussed out before we got killed.  We ended up spending the first weekend bumming around town and relaxing.  One day, Timo and I went to Earthquake Park and went walking along the coastal trail for a bit.  When we got back to the rental car, it had been broken into and my video camera was gone, Timo's day pack was gone, and Double O's 45 was missing out of the glove box.  (He forgot to take it out and Timo and I didn't even know it was there.)  We filed a police report and got insurance stuff taken care of, and got a new car.  The next week Double O had Mon-Fri off. I don't remember what we did on Monday, but I know that Tuesday afternoon, around 6 p.m. we started hiking Crow Pass (Girdwood to Eagle River).  By Thursday at 4 p.m. we were off the trail.  46 hours!  Amazing.  It was a great hike, lots of awesome views, glaciers, and porky pines.  Terrificoso.  And that's all we really did up there.  We spent the last few days hanging out in Anchorage and Girdwood and Beluga Point.  Hillary and I are over forever and I am finally happy again.  It took a lot for me to step back from that situation and realize how stupid and pointless it would be for me to hang on there.  I finally feel good about me again.  Double O and I will be in Las Vegas this September.  He's buying a one-way ticket and we'll be driving up to Anchorage together.  The trip will probably be pushed back a week or so because I want to spend as much time as possible with my family before I move back to AlAskA.  So maybe September 14th or so.  We'll get that worked out as soon as possible, Mike, so you know and can plan.  I don't think we're going to be able to spend maybe more than 4 days in Vegas because of how much time off Double O has.  We have to expect some delays on a trip that long in a car and we don't want him getting fired or anything.  So, back in Florida, I'm starting the moving process now.  I'm getting rid of a lot of crap that I don't need so that TMO won't show up at my parent's house with a TON of useless stuff.  The only things I'm moving to AlAskA with is what I can fit into my car.  TMO will move it to AK, but I'd have to pay the difference between Osage and Anchorage.  I can't afford that!  And I don't need anything.  Basically I'm moving to AlAskA with a few boxes of books, some plastic bags with clothes, and a few books of CD's.  Double O and Julie have agreed to let me stay with them until I can get on my feet, so I'm very greatful for that.  We'll see what happens.  The title of this blog is the name of my new CD.  I've recorded a bunch of crappy songs over the last year, mostly those that I have written myself.  I'm calling it Raw In Its Juice.  The track listing is as follows:  1.  Raw Sea Mud Comes To Life At Dawn 2.  In The Aeroplane Over The Sea (Neutral Milk Hotel cover) 3.  Ode To Modesty 4.  In Your Mind (Built to Spill cover) 5.  Our Names 6.  High as Low 7.  Pacing the Landslide 8.  My New Song When It's 35.5 Degrees Fahrenheit 9.  Brother's Turtleneck Fiasco 10.  Leopold's Letter 11.  The Mancala Song 12.  Everybody Everybody  It's nothing less than perfect.  Peace and Love, Mungo   Song of the Day:  Laura Veirs - "Icebound Stream"

      I went to the post office last night. Get this for irony of ironies... There was a Fathers day card and a child support bill. Man it seems like I get that fucking bill like 12 times a month.  Anyway, I have noticed that Lorelei writes a lot like her mother. It was cool to get a card though.  I am upset at the lack of bloggin's lately. I am not the greatest at it, but shit, are we having that much difficulty to spout a few lines every so often?  Dueces  Eddie

      Tomorrow will be my first free day to do anything.  I haven't spent even 4 hours at my apartment since I got back last Monday.  Sunday (tomorrow) will be the day.  I'm off now to help somebody move.  Ya, I know I know, it's 11:05 p.m.... who moves this late in the day?  Aaron Wood does.  He just PCS'd and he's moving.  The house is 2 hours from here.  Sheesh.

      Got the truck back with the new gears, got the quads back and I accomplished quite a bit fixing up the trailer.  I put some vent covers on from out old trailer so that we can leave the vents open in all weather. I fixed a door that wouldn't stay closed as well as a few other little things.  We are about to head to the airport to pick up Sara. I think I will see if she wants to go for a night ride on the quads. Maybe, maybe not.  Mungo, where you at brother?

Mungo, welcome back to your living hell of FL. just remember, you only have a few months left. Have you definately determined what you are going to do when you get out? Are you still set on going to AK or have you changed your mind?  ST, I have the itch to go camping. I also have an itch that I can not scratch right now because it is under the chem gear. he he he... I am so ready to get home, see my kid, hang with the bro and be back in the land of the free.  I have 19 months and 3 days left until I am outta this BIATCH. But who's counting.  Eddie

      ...and I already have the Monday blues. Man, that sucks.  At least I have stuff to look forward to. Tomorrow I take the truck in after work to get the gears replaced so it will tow better. Mr. F250 will be in the shop for about 2-3 days. After dropping off the truck Beck and I are going to go and see Harry Potter. Tue is my overnight so nothing much there. On Wed my sister gets in to town for a 5 day visit. Thu I work, pick up the ATV's from the shop and that night Sara wants to go down to the strip and see the sights that she hasn't really been able to see on her previous trips. On Fri we are all heading up to Mt Charleston to camp until Sun.   Mt Charleston is only 45 min away from Vegas and is usually about 30° cooler (8000 ft). There is a lot of hiking and stuff to do up there so it will be fun. Can you believe that Sara has never been camping? Okay, so we are using our trailer, but that is still camping in my book!  Oh, and sometime during her stay we will have to find some time to ride the ATV's. Early morning or late night are the only times that you can ride right now because of the heat. Your head will just cook in a padded helmet in 110° temps.  Okay, busy ass week. I should go get some sleep but I am not even close to tired. CRAP!  ST out

      You are not alone my brother... we are still here.  I just got back from being recalled. The Exercise kicked off this morning. Fun, fun. I now have about 10 hours till my shift and I am not even tired anymore and will get jack shit for sleep.  Last night was another night of pool shooting and beer drinking. Pretty fun night. We just sat around, played some pool and talked with the juicies there. No worries, no juices were bought. The Ma's didn't even bother us for the most part. That is when you know you are in a bar too often. They start leaving you alone.  Later All  Eddie

      Right about now Vegas can lick my sac. Yesterday, while picking up our trailer from the dealer I thought that I was going to die...it was probably 120° on the asphalt. Oh well, so goes life in hell...or at least the same temp.  The trailer is home and we just love it. This morning we went and got everything out of the old trailer so we could put it in the new one. The old trailer was then dropped off at the dealer.  On a side note. On the way home from the dealer with the Rage'n the freeway just came to a stop. About a ½ mile ahead a life flight heliochopter landed right on the freeway. We were stuck for about 10 min until it took off again and flew right over us. When they started letting people back through we saw a dead body on the road covered in a sheet with only the feet sticking out. It is just eerie to see that, you know?  Okay, I am going to go and take a shower now...I stink. COLD shower....mmmmmm, nice.  ST stinkin up the joint.

      So what are you getting next year?  This is getting worse than me with cars when I was in AK. Do you have a link to see what the trailer is or do I just sit here and look at all 5th wheels until I find the one with those specs?  Russians are good... Think of what you say after a fortune cookie too add to that. Besides that, I don't give a fuck what anyone else says as long as my bro's have got my back. If it doesn't work out, so be it. I won't know until I give it a shot. I love the chick, I love being with her and I want her with me. Can't live life without a sense of adventure. If you do, you will sell yourself short of opportunities missed.  I want to see the trailer.

      ...we bought one. Damn, dude, I just can't stop the madness! We liked our Tahoe but this one is much better. It will allow us to put the quads inside the trailer, it has a built in generator, 36 gallon fuel tank with pump station for filling up the quads, tons of storage, 106 gallon fresh water tank and many other things. It doesn't have a slide out but it doesn't feel like it needs one. I can't touch the ceilings without jumping. The best thing is that it's a fifth wheel (it connects inside the truck bed like an 18 wheeler) so it will tow MUCH better. The new one is 30 feet long but only about 26 feet will be behind the truck. The old one was 33 feet, all behind the truck!  We pick it up tomorrow afternoon! WOO WOO!  ST

      I will end up with a Russian chick! Good grief guys. I am not about to judge anyone about anything. I am behind you guys with whatever decicions you make but it is just a little shocking.  Being over here and not over there; I have a different view. All you here about the Russian women over there is that they just want to find a GI to bring them to the states. You have heard it all so I won't go into it. Like I said, I am not there and can't/won't judge since all I have are stories and lore.  I honestly hope it works out for both of you. Oldfuck, it sucks to hear that your marriage is on the way out. I know that you guys have tried for quite awhile and maybe this is the way things were meant to be. Sorry about the split, though.  Damn Russians are invading....run for the hills!  ST running like hell.

      Good to see the Oldshit back on the blog.  ST, So are you actually looking at getting a new one? I don't know what I would do without having to fix the silverware drawer every 3 minutes while we are camping. That other one looks nice, but are you actually considering getting another one? I think the one you have right now is good enough, but hey, I wouldn't mind a queen size bed either.  It is too fuckin' early here. It is just now creeping up on 0630... I am not usually up until 2 hours from now. I hate early morning missions, especially when I am instructing and not controlling.  Wipin' the sleep from my eyes,  Eddie

      I know I haven't blogged in a while.  One sec...Okay I'm back...had to cook a single noodle and whip myself with it...Had to stop though as I was enjoying it too much.  That's another story altogether though!  :)   Anyhoos...I'm back with a vengeance!  It's been going on for a while, but my 14 year marriage is coming to an end in less than a month.  The paperwork is almost finalized.  I know initially you all may think "What an ass to leave his wife while he's in Korea", but as ST knows how things were in Alaska when Michaela and I seperated for about 7 months...things just have never worked out when we tried again.  You can judge if you like...just careful who or what you judge lest you be judged.  So, I'm taking leave on the 28th to go back and get out of base housing, then returning to Korea on the 9th of July.  Here's the kicker...I have leave in to go to Russia on 8 August.  Yes, you heard correctly...RUSSIA.  There's a tall blonde there named Anastasia who is going to sponsor my visit to Russia and even let me stay at her home...hmmmm...sounds like a fun adventure to me.  We became quite close over the period of MANY months.  As all of you know...I'm the OldMan; OldFart; OldShit etc...I've been around the block and am not blind to games and bullshit.  This girl has me spinning...no doubt about it.  Anyway, thought I'd give something to talk about and keep the blog going strong.  Shoot away fellas...I can take the feedback/opinions/what the Fuck ever you have to say.  Bring it  :)  That's all for now...yeah the OldMan is still alive and Kickin!

      I instructed the idiot today. The first one went OK, at best. The second one, the comm was rancid. It was like a shit pool pouring out of his mouth. Then the SD knocked a call that he made... I looked at the SD and said "I told him to say that." The SD backstepped a few, and tried to think of a better way to say what was quickly. He lost. I won. It was funny though, not a real argument, just a disagreement on some minor comm.  Hild's favorite phrase is "That is how I learned it at the schoolhouse." Do you have dumbasses for instructors down there or are they that tasked where they can not pay attention during the mission?  Anywho... Went out and nursed a beer for about 1.5 hours (might as well have had a nipple on it) at a bar while shooting pool, then basically went home. We stopped by 2 or 3 other clubs but walked out after about 30 seconds.  What a boring fargin night.  Eddie

      I am instructing an idiot tommorow. I say this because, well, apparently he is one. Lt Hild... for Mungo, since he hates the guy. I guess this guy does not know his ass from a hole in the ground. He does not even know the difference between "Picture" and "Bogey dope." Nor does he know what a threat range is. What the fuck are y'all teaching down at that school anyway?  Our DOW chief is calling to Tyndall to find out "What the fuck?"  Should be interesting, to say the least. It is so bad that they said the only ones that could instruct him was MSgt Scheck (a patch) and me. This kinda boosted the ego that didn't really need the boosting. But hey, what can I say? I am fucking good.  I still miss my chick. Which reminds me... Bubbles... do you have a comment you would like to let me in on?  September should be interesting to say the least. At the very least, I will get to see a different country that I probably would not have. At the best, everything goes good and we continue on.  I talked to the ST rugrat this morning. She said "Hi Eddie!! Love you" At least that is what I think she said, it was slightly garbled. Cute Kid.  Speaking of cute kids... Lorelei is doing good. I haven't really talked to her lately because it is a bitch and a half to get a hold of Miranda. When I did get a hold of her Lorelei was already asleep. She said she is doing well though. Her speach is getting better and makes real sentences that make sense. I miss her sooooooooo much too. I miss her more than Elena. I don't think that is neither bad nor suprising though. I get her for the whole month of December and part of January when I get back. This also means that I will only have to pay half of the child support. That is definately a bonus, especially since it is B-Day time, X-Mas, and moving in time with my no furniture having ass.  ST if you see some great deals on stuff let me know. I can transfer the cash. But more than likely there will be nothing spectacular that I won't be able to find somewhere else.  I am wide awake and it is just past midnight here. This sucks.  Later peeps.. off to fuck off on the internet.   Eddie

      ...and we will start with our downstairs bathroom. Beck and I got crazy with the cheese whiz last night and painted the bathroom. It's tiny but we did a total make over.  1930 hrs...  Wash all the walls with TSP (cleaner).  Paint all the walls (medium gray).  Hang little cabinet over toilet (white with mirror in it).  -----  0000 hrs...  Go to bed.  -----  Today...  Buy and install new fancy towel rack and matching TP holder (white and chrome).  Buy and hang up new towels (maroon and white)  Buy some spray paint and paint small ledge shelf (white).  Hang small shelf.  -----  Still need to do...  Buy maroon bath rug to match all the other colors.  Buy chrome hand soap pump thingy.    Side note... when the can of spray paint says to use in temps between 65 and 85 degrees you should do it (unless you live in hell like me where it never gets to 85 in the summer). When it is over 108 degrees outside (in the shade) spray paint can easily dry in the time it takes the paint to leave the can and reach whatever you are painting. This makes for a fun painting experience. The up side to it drying so fast is that there is no over spray problems because the paint is dry before it hits anything (like the quads). Sweet.   That is the latest happenings.  ST off to sniff some of that great spray paint.

      Mungo, I got yo back yo.  I'll send you money for cigs in jail. Maybe that will keep you from being someone's bitch. Good luck.  If I were you I would have been in jail along time ago. I don't envy you...except that you are getting out.  ST laughing on the floor.

      I have been married for 3 years today. It's still good.  Not too much going on at the moment. It's hot. Sunny. Hot.  We are planning our Disneyland vacation for this Oct. Eddie went with us last year. This year we aren't taking the trailer. For $509 we get a 5 day pass to DL and 4 nights stay in the Hampton Inn as well as breakfast each morning. There is no way we could come close to matching that price if we were to drag the trailer with us. The gas alone would be $250. If we take the Focus then the gas is free.  Next week we are probably going to take the Focus and head to Colorado Springs to visit Beck's parents. We will leave on Wed and come home on Sun. This will be a free vacation exept for food. Can't beat that with a stick.  After that we are heading to MN for Labor Day. Leave Fri morning and come home Sun night. Short trip but my parents really wanted to see Ashlee so they even paid for the tickets! Once again, free vacation except for paying Amy to watch the dogs ($80) and and parking at the airport ($40). Okay, not free but hella cheap. Huh...huh...I said "hella".  Then the bros come out to Vegas...well, Mungo, anyway. I will believe 007 when he gets off the plane here in Vegas. Cost of that vacation...unknown...but it can't be too much. Maybe some camping or something like that. Who know's maybe we will go see Niagra Falls since it is only a couple of hours away. Hee hee.  Okay, I'm done with blabbing about our vacations.  ST...gonna need some relaxation time after this shit is over.

      The mountain behind us (40 miles) is on fire. So far is has only burned about 50 acres so it is not a large fire by any means. The only reason that I bring it up is that the cloud of smoke has turned the sunlight orange. Cool looking.   Beck and I have actually thought about staying in Vegas after I get out of the AF. This is a distant thought. Vegas kind of grows on you after awhile...you know...like a fungus or something. The job market is going to be the deciding factor.   I have been pondering learning to drive heavy construction equipment. The big graders, front end loaders, cranes, etc. They can make $35 + &nbsp;an hour and I would be a union man. I think that job sort of sounds fun. Every guy thinks big cranes and shit are cool! I will check in to it and report back with my findings.   Okay, off to surf around the net.   ST

          Everybody, everybody~    &nbsp; I have a lot I could tell y'all about my weekend, but I'm way too tired to go into it all.&nbsp; So here's the summary.&nbsp; I Friday I napped and played pool with Kelly, Enrique, and Caridad.&nbsp; On Saturday I went jet-skiing with Swiadek, Bug, and Billy.&nbsp; Then we ate at Applebees.&nbsp; Saturday night I went to the Java and watched my friend James play in a jazz band, the Jon West Quartet.&nbsp; Last night I went to an experimental music show.&nbsp; James played in his band Kid Kaboose and the Lunch Box Krew (KK&amp;LBK) The headliner was Skeleton Key... they were faboo, I want you guys to look them up on line.&nbsp; They're from New York.&nbsp; I also spent a lot of time at the Camera Store talking to Amanda, Allison, and Jackie.&nbsp; I got presents from them!&nbsp; The show was definitely the highlight of my weekend.&nbsp; There was an announcment made at the end.&nbsp; &quot;Thanks for coming out tonight.&nbsp; Thanks for getting juice on my speakers.&nbsp; I appriciate it.&quot;      &nbsp; Last night I smashed my toe on my guitar case in the dark.&nbsp; It split open and bled all over my carpet and my blankets.

      I appreciate your concerns on me wearing mops on my head. I have stopped that... for now.I may feel like doing it again in the October time frame... but not right now.  ST, I could not go to the link that you posted. It said it was forbidden from this server. Fuck it.  I got a care package in the mail yesterday. It was a "Support our Troops" deal from a town that I lived in for 4-5 years 18 years ago. I am still trying to figure out how my name ended up on their list. Not that I don't appreciate the effort, just wondering about how my info got there. Definately a very odd package to recieve.  I went to the post office yesterday and saw that wonderful little yellow card. I thought it was from my mom or possibly from the old battle axe, but nope, it was from Winnebago, IL. Dissapointing but at the same time not.  This is an odd thought... I was more ready to leave AK by this time (meaning only 4 months and some change left) than I am to leave Korea. Not that I don't want to leave, because trust me I do, but I was really ready to get the hell out of AK by this point. Maybe it is because I only have a 1 year here and it was 4 over there, but either way, this assignment has not been bad overall. This is just a lonely assignment. Meaning I don't have my kid or my best friend anywhere close to me. I am glad that Oldfucker is here, otherwise I think I would have gone nuts at this point. I wish he would fucking blog.   Mungo has a good point of him becoming like Bubbles.    JUST FUCKING BLOG MOTHER FUCKERS!!!!    Eddie

      I actually did some exercise for two days in a row. Raquetball. Ouch. I am sore.  It will be mega, super fun when you guys get to Vegas. I won't believe Slubbles is making it until I hear that his ticket is paid for.  So, how can I get rich by doing absolutely nothing? Does that sound crazy? Well, I can dream, right? Buzz off.  Mops on your head? What kind of freaky deaky crap are you getting in to over there, Eddie? Hey, I support most of the things that you do (even the stupid stuff) but this might be pushing it just a little bit. Tone it down with the mops and I think that you will be happier.

           "Hello all you pies and pie people!&nbsp; Such a lovely  gathering of...pies... I'd like to give a very special shout out to Lemon  Poo-Tang over there."   The Blog Title is off the price tag on my  Pepto Bismal.&nbsp; I ate 70% of a whole apple pie last night...in one  sitting...and then I went directly to bed.&nbsp; Too much!&nbsp; I wrote two  songs last night; this was pre-pie.&nbsp; The first is called, "Silk Wallet  Wardrobe."&nbsp; It's about song writing and the&nbsp;ridiculousness of every  little thing on Earth.&nbsp; The other song, with a working title of "I Never  Want to See a Train Again," is about bashfulness around women and what happens  in the most extreme cases.&nbsp; I will be cutting my 2nd CD on Monday (the  aniversery of my 1st album entitled "Solid Mud: First Words from the Sea") and I  will call it "Raw in its Juice.     On Sunday I'm going to a birthday party for me and another  girl with my birthday.&nbsp; I can't remember her name, it might be  Allison.&nbsp; Anyway, she's only 17, but her boss, Amanda, is the photolab girl  who I have a crush on and she invited me out.&nbsp; We're going to an  experimental music show.&nbsp; The band is called Kid Konstant and the Lunch Box  Crew.&nbsp; Should be a good time on Sunday.&nbsp; I'm seeing Amanda tonight  too, after work.&nbsp; I like this girl.     Okay all you freaky pie people, I'm going back to an  EPR.&nbsp; Eddie, have fun wearing a mop on your head or whatever it is you do  during an excercise.&nbsp; Oldshit, are you chillin' with Double O?&nbsp;  Haven't seen anything from you in while.&nbsp; ST, I'm definately excited about  Vegas.&nbsp; I'll be there the day before Double O flies in, how's that  sound?

      Yup, that is all I have left. No more. (hopefully)  We are in the middle of an exercise that will hopefully end tommorow night. Doubt it, but it is possible. I will be happy if we just end the MOPP shit.  Ah well, such is life.   Y'all have a good day  Eddie

          Okay okay okay!&nbsp; So after talking to my mother last night,  I decided once and for all that, YES! I will be moving to AlAskA for  shizzle.&nbsp; I had been feeling pretty guilty about getting out of the Air  Force and treating my family like just another point on the map for me to hit up  on a road trip.&nbsp; After expressing this thought to my momma, she said,  "Erik.&nbsp; You'll be 25.&nbsp; You're young yet and you have a whole life  ready to be lived.&nbsp; If you move back to Iowa, you... won't live the life you  need.&nbsp; You had better move to AlAskA, you had better get back into those  mountains, and you had better start school."&nbsp; I love my mommy.  I'm  feeling very ill today.&nbsp; I do not want to be here no way no how nuh  uh.  Have I told you guys about the new story I'm working on?&nbsp;   Paradise Plain  is it's name, my transamerican story is its game.&nbsp;  I'm very excited about writing this thing, it's really very excellent... says  I.&nbsp; It starts off with a despicable view of Florida's panhandle;  specifically juxoposition of the cold and dry proclivity of the  locals&nbsp;despite the tropical storms and inherent humidity.&nbsp; From there  I move on to tell stories of&nbsp;how I have plenty of&nbsp;good TIMES, but no  good DAYS.&nbsp; I have friends and lightning here in the panhandle, but there  is nothing (not at all) strong enough to hold me here.&nbsp; Leaving Florida  will be like a diet for my life.&nbsp; But with all diets, when you trim the  fat, you're bound to lose a little muscle.&nbsp;   Peace and  Love, Mungo   Song of the day:&nbsp; Mungocult - "The  Transamerianian Jet-Setter Bum"

      Hot and muggy day here. Not many clouds around here either. 1600 hrs rolls around and all of a sudden the winds start whipping around. The lightning and thunder start roaring. Within 15 min the streets were flooding. Then all hell broke loose.  &nbsp;  It rained like mad on our side of the valley and the lightning was insane as well. Beck and I were outside trying to get Crazy Daisy to pee and lightning struck just a few blocks away...Beck and I both about jumped out of our skin! My ears were ringing for awhile after that one. I had to venture out to get Tahoe from the vet (teeth cleaning) and I had the windshield wipers on full blast and I was only going 30-35mph. Water was up over the curbs and the streets were pretty much under an inch to a foot of water everywhere. Lightning was striking close by at leat 6-7 a minute. The power in the vets office even went out for a second when lighting struck nearby.  &nbsp;  The whole stormzilla only lasted about an hour before it passed us. Afterward we could here sirens everywhere and as we were leaving our neighborhood there was a fire truck in front of a house just down the street. We stopped and the neighbors said that they thought it was hit by lightning! Damn dude!  &nbsp;  On the way back from dinner (about 2 hours after the storm) you would have never thought all hell was just breaking loose. Everything was dried up.  &nbsp;  Game over,  ST

      It is Oldshit's B-Day today (over here) We are going to go out to lunch with some other friends and have a good time. &nbsp; I am still having issues with the blogger. I still can not open the regular one that you just read. I have to sign in and read them that way. That does not work all the time either. This will probably work itself out around the time that I get a connection back in the states. &nbsp; Mungo, What the fuck was with that last post? I am guessing it read all the font stuff and could not do it because of the blogg not allowing it or something. &nbsp; Anyway...... &nbsp; Dueces &nbsp; Eddie

      Things here are swell. What I mean to say is that things here are dandy.  Daisy is cute as can be and I will have pictures on my site by the end of this coming weekend. She still doesn't get the whole taking a shit outside but at least she doesn't scream all night. Although, we do get up about every 2-3 hours at night and take her out to pee. I am hoping she will figure out the concept of where to do her thing.  Ashlee is still two and you can tell. Can't complain too much since I have seen worse.  Life is pretty good here in Las Vegas. They are saying that it may rain today. That would be cool since we only get 4.5 inches of falling water a year.  Talk to you fags later.  ST

          Forces of Van of the Waals, were baptized forces of London; scatter forces of London.&nbsp; The German physicist Fritz London is out of his mind.&nbsp; Kindsa like this site:&nbsp;     http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/London-forces     I like this idea, but I think it sounds better high on tea. Shouting and shouting and shouting! They could make the conditions for something more quiet.&nbsp; London Forces is a surplus of lies. Limes and wacky oranges. Somewhat freshly squeezed, something you can open with your lips. Which never turns sour. I don't know, where the quiet streets are.&nbsp; Are they simple to find? What is the studio called? Is it called Shutter Nose?&nbsp; I mentioned the silent presses to Badoo, but I don't think he heard me.&nbsp; I was so quiet... I whipered it from my tent. I like sparklers. I take a grasp of them, I ignite them and then throw them and let flow directly upward and rain downward upon the heads of others.&nbsp; There is a girl of the photographic machine. Her name is Amanda.&nbsp; She's lovely. You'd look at her parts. She's probably the only girl who knows me most pleasantly in Florida. As soon as I know it completely, we will imply a future in steady plans of disembarkation of Florida together.&nbsp; If you think her a dismountingly responsible person, for she's a dangerous person, your prospective as my friends would make you right.&nbsp; She has a thing for all creation's music and has it arranged in a one-night format, easy to conqure on headphones. We've made it into clear programs for evening.&nbsp; We hope you like it.      Skate hard, retard,  Nedosis

      Mungo, I feel your pain brother. I have "senioritis" already. I hate my job, I am not looking forward to going to hill, but I am looking forward to leaving Korea.   Don't get me wrong. I love controlling. There is nothing in the AF that I would want to do, but the office shit drives me insane and seeing where this AF is going, I don't want to be a part of it.  I am ready to be a cop. If that does not work out for some reason, I have no problems with driving a postal vehicle. If that don't work out, I would work for my uncle with his business.  The SRB still does not make me want to stay in. In fact, the only reason I would re-enlist is if I could max out the bonus. But that is still not incentive enough.  My supervisors want me to stay in. Most of them want me to go to AWIDS. That is nice to know that they have confidence in me, but I don't care at this point. I have done more than my fair share of time and am ready to get the fuck out.  ST... How is the new pup working out?  Later Bro's

           In four easy steps!         1) After answering a call, press the &quot;transfer&quot; button    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  With the exception of my month of wavering, from the moment I joined the Air Force I have planned on separation.&nbsp; I hit the transfer button right away       2) Dial &quot;3&quot; then the extension you wish to transfer the call to    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Double O is the man for letting me stay at his house in Anchorage.&nbsp; I can't wait to get back to AlAskA.&nbsp; Leaving Panama City is good enough, leaving Florida is even better, but leaving the south and gaining AlAskA is the most I could ask for and best it could have turned out.&nbsp; There really is no end to my excitement.       3) Wait for the receiving party to answer.&nbsp; When they have opened the line, simply hit the &quot;transfer&quot; button again    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  His friend, Billy, is going to be moving into an apartment around the same time I will be getting up there, and I will probably end up moving in with Billy.&nbsp; Billy looks like a mountain man... or a biker, depending on how much sleep he's got.       4) Listen to ensure that the transfer worked, then hang up    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I guess all I have to do now is wait it out.&nbsp; I have 44 days left in the Air Force.&nbsp; That's just amazing.&nbsp; I've been trying my very hardest not to let &quot;senioritis&quot; hit me.&nbsp; But I think it has.&nbsp; I know this part of my life is about over.&nbsp; Sometimes it's a depressing thought, but mostly I remember that I have had some really great times that I never would have experienced had I not joined the Air Force.&nbsp; I wouldn't have met any of you.&nbsp; But this part of my life is over, and it's time for me to get on with what I really want to do with my life:&nbsp; SPACE TRAVEL      Peace and Love,    Mungo

          I went to Fort Walton Beach and swam in a hotel pool that looked like Mikey Mouse's head.&nbsp; I swam and drank beer with Kevin, Tommy, Elaine, and their friend Jamie for 4 or 5 hours.&nbsp; It was a good time.&nbsp; Then I went to Target and bought a tee-shirt that says, &quot;DUDE.&quot;&nbsp; It's rippin' awsome.&nbsp; For diner we went to Olive Garden where we all got full on bread sticks and house salad and didn't have much of an appitite for our main courses...which none of us ate very much of.&nbsp; Also had a beer and a wine there.&nbsp; Then we went back to the hotel and drank and listened to music.&nbsp; Then we went to Morris' house and drank more, watched &quot;Airheads,&quot; almost passed out.&nbsp; Then Kevin drove us back to his house and we played guitar, drank beers, and finally passed out...hard.&nbsp; Then we woke up at 0700 and went canoeing.&nbsp; We drank a whole bunch of Gatorade.&nbsp; It has been over 100 degress in Florida too.&nbsp; S.T., I feel your pain-o, yo.&nbsp; Paino, piano... pa-tato, pa-toto.&nbsp; Last night I played GHOST RECON: JUNGLE THUNDER until almost 2300 when I HAD to got to bed.

      Today (as well as yesterday) we are going to go look at dogs. Yes, Beck wants to find a friend for Tahoe. Noble idea...just a pain in the ass! Okay, so it is my job to be grumpy about this. I am sure that I will love the dog and it will be better for Tahoe to have a playmate.  STILL A PAIN IN MY ASS!  Oh yeah, and we are going to check out some stuff for Eddie's new place...well, his new place to be...in a few months...next year...sometime.  ST

      So there I am, I am checking the blog every day and trying to think of shit to write about. Well, Not much is going through my mind.  I will have this to say though...  A few days ago, It got ugly. All of our missions cancelled and they turned the beer light on at the squadron. Not a bad thing in most cases. I had a couple beers then my sup busted out the shots and said "Ahh, come on Skid, just take one" so I did. But he did not stop at one. and I don't remember most of the night. I puked for the first time since I have been here. I think this is because if I had taken a breathalizer test I would have blown well over a .20. Not a good thing. I could not walk home. I was basically drug home by 2 people. I then fell and hit my head on the toilet while going to puke. I have a small gash on the middle of my forehead. I was told it bled quite a bit. I also fucked up my knee which is now getting better except when I put latteral pressure on it.  I am not particullarly proud of this moment, but I figured that y'all would want to know how much of an idiot I can be. I am also not proud of this because I think I was about a shot away from alcohol poisoning.  I NEED to leave this place. 4.5 months left and hopefully no more occasions like that again.  Sorry ST for not bloggin' more.  Eddie

      I have no problems being the only one to blog. I think that in a year or so it will be a blast to see what was going through my mind.  Well, it is Friday and life is good. We had Beck's nephew, Michael, and a friend of his drive down from UT to take care of some stuff so they are using our house to crash at. He called on the day they were coming to ask if it was okay...geez, a little more notice would have been nice. Oh well, no biggie.  Beck and I are going to get up and go riding tomorrow at 0500 to try and beat the heat. Riding in 110 degrees is NOT fun.  I think that we are also going to go to the pound and look at dogs. It would be nice for Tahoe to have a friend since I think he gets bored during the day. I don't know if we can get as lucky as we did with Tahoe. We will probably come home empty handed but it will be nice to look.  We got the truck washed yesterday and the idots at the car wash put Armor All on the steps! I have almost busted my ass several times getting in the damn truck...some people.  Done.  ST

      Mungo stated somewhere that he was really concerned about having fun on a jet ski because of the pollution it causes. Mungo...sorry dude, I have to school you on this one. Your concern is a typical "Liberal" environmentalist response and must be dealt with in the harshest manner! ;)  How many miles do you think you have driven your car just because you were bored? Jones runs, etc? I bet that adds up to quite a few gallons of gas.  Having fun on jet skis or quads every now and then isn't going to kill all the cute little animals. Everything in moderation.  Have fun and try not too worry too much.  ST

      The official high here was 108. In the real world driving around it was at least 110+.  This is the time of year that I hate Vegas. Just too damn hot to do anything. We won't see high's below 100 for probably 2 months or longer.  Not too much going on. I want to go ride my quads but the heat is just too much. Maybe I will get up around 0500 this weekend and go. Then again...maybe not.  ST out

Actually I am just trying to keep on ridin' that wave to get the fuck outta here.  nothing exciting going on over here. The weekend was un-eventful for the most part. Just did the typical thing people do over here. Drink, screw around.   Wish there were something more for me to add, but there ain't.

      Home from camping. Boy was it beautiful up in the mountains! We just found a spot off of a dirt road and camped. There was a creek with a little waterfall right by us. Our nearest neighbor was about 1/4 mile away and it was amazing!  There are so many ATV trails to ride that you could be there for weeks and not see them all.   The downside. My kid was the total "terrible two". Beck and I just about lost our minds because Ashlee would throw a fit about ANYTHING. Sunday she wasn't too bad though and we got some good riding in.  On Sat night we went into the small town (population about 1500 or so) and watched a really cool fireworks show. Great time. You may be wondering why they had the fireworks on Sat and not Sun. In Mormon country Sun is family time and you don't really go out and do stuff.  Overall the trip was amazing.  Where are all the basards at? No one blogging any more?  ST

      Yesterday I went into work at around 0700. I had to go in early to control a tanker mission. No big deal because I was supposed to be done at 1600. Well, then I instructed a person and hooked him on it. The flight started off with an emergency that the student did really well with. Better than most qualified controllers do that I have seen. Then the mission came. I don't really know how to describe it other than... It was all fucked up. Not many calls were correct. So I hooked him. This now meant that I had to go to the debrief with him. the debrief started at 1930. I was not done until 2100.   It was a long fucking day.  That is pretty much the eventful stuff for that day. I got done with work and went out, met Oldfart, and drank a few beers and wound down.  I have to go into work today (a day off for the base) for a DOT meeting. How I got roped into this I don't know. I am not even attatched to DOT. But, my flight CC wanted me there. That is coming up in about 2 hours or so.  Have fun camping ST.  Eddie

          Dear Double O,    &nbsp; It would be very very cool if you could get your ticket for the 14th or 15th of September.&nbsp; It's earlier than we had planned for, but that's what ST says will work best for him.&nbsp; I know that you have your own schedule to work out and that your days off work differently than our leave does.&nbsp; If ST can take leave inbetween weekends, that would give us all 9 days straight for campin's and whatnots.&nbsp; If we don't make it into Vegas until the 16th, campin will probably be out of the question.       &nbsp; However, Mike wants to take leave in between weekends, and that would be the 13th - 17th OR the 20th - 24th.&nbsp; I'm not sure what the 15th has to do with the weekends, September 15th is a Wednesday.       &nbsp; No matter how it works out, the most important thing is that we'll all be able to hang out, drink coffees, go for some drives, wait for the cake to come down the chimney, blow out all the candles on our colored eggs, and have people sing Valentine carols to us as we all open our pumpkins.&nbsp; We'll make the best of the time no matter what.      &nbsp; But dude.&nbsp; If you don't have your ticket by the 15th of August, ST can't garuntee he'll get his leave.&nbsp; I'll be callin' yas Wednesday night, still.&nbsp; Peace out foolio.

My brother gets in to Vegas tomorrow and will be going to CO with us to visit Beck's parents and ride the quads.  Talk to you fools later.  ST out.

      I see the whole 007 thing is going to be a big cluster fuck. Oh well, I should have expected that. So now you guys are going to get here on the night of the 16th and NOT the 15th?  Well, I am not taking fucking leave on the 15th or 16th. The way it was originally planned is that you guys would be here from a weekend to a weekend so I wouldn't have to take leave over a weekend if we go camping.  Oh well. I am sure we will figure out something. I am not taking leave over a weekend so that is going to rule out camping since we would have to go from a Fri to a Mon or Tue. Sorry, but I am not using extra leave because of shitty planning.  I have no doubt that we will have fun...just let me know what is going on so I can adjust the leave that is on the books (for the second time).  If this isn't sorted out and final by Aug 15 then I am just going to take my leave off the books.  ST...EDITED OUT....
