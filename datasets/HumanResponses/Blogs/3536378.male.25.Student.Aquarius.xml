      i started typing this blog to get some things off my chest!  it is unusually tough moving from one place to another and trying to do all these things at once.  i have been just shuting down most of the time;taking the easy way out.  i was expecting to have some comments!  but how?  the thousands of blogs are bombarding with people from around the world!  that's not a bad thing, but there needs to be an easier way to read what you want to read and comment on them!  can't we get a voting system of what is being read or what is of interest?  i doubt any one will read this so i guess this is just going to have to be a therapeutic forum!

      Can I break the patterns of life and choose another?

       Every time I drive somewhere, I am confronted with slow, bad drivers; so I speed to my destination!  I gun it to the next red light and floor it well above the speed limit!  Speed does not kill people, carelessness does!  I am extremely safe!  And forget turning signals, I am going faster!  Even though I am in Colorado, California stops are preferred.  My Yields are safe!  I have to make evasive maneuvers in an out of lanes to avoid the slow ones!  I am very safe when doing this!  Regardless of how many times I have been down the same roads and exits, I will always wait to the last minute and jump in the lane!  Again, I am going faster!  I am cautious!  It is a must to honk my horn, flash my highs, raise my fist and finger when someone cuts me off.  I do not care if s/he had their blinker on and waved in the mirror.  I am going faster, and one car in my lane is slowing me down.  I never make mistakes when I drive, so if I abruptly end up in your lane, and you honk, of course I am going to honk back and cuss at you!  Finally, I would not hesitate to stop traffic if the road suddenly changes on me.  You should be paying attention to me in front of you anyway!
