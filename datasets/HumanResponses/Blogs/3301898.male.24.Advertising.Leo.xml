						    urlLink The Poet of Dirty Words - History takes a second look at Philip Larkin. By Stephen?Burt   One of Britain's best-known modern poems cannot be quoted on American network television. The offending word arrives in the very first line:    They fuck you up, your mum and dad,      They may not mean to but they do They fill you with the faults they had      And add some extra just for you.  But they were fucked up in their turn      By fools in old style hats and coats Who half the time were soppy-stern      And half at one another's throats.  Man hands on misery to man.      It deepens like a coastal shelf. Get out as early as you can      And don't have any kids yourself.  The poem is "This Be the Verse," and its author, Philip Larkin (1922-85), is back in the news, thanks to a radical revision of his Collected Poems. By the time of his death, Larkin, a grumpy, publicity-shy librarian, had become an unlikely celebrity, a rabbity symbol for his readers' accumulated regrets, calling his own childhood "a forgotten boredom." For the first edition of Larkin's Collected Poems (1988), the editor, Anthony Thwaite, printed all Larkin's verse in chronological order, with published and unpublished, finished and unfinished, verse side by side. Already controversial in Britain, Thwaite's new edition instead reprints the books as Larkin published them during his lifetime, followed by verse that appeared in magazines, and omitting everything left in manuscript at his death. The new volume ought to help new and old readers make sense of this cantankerous, sometimes contradictory poet. It also shuts out some of his best poems.  A product of middle England's middle class, Larkin graduated from Oxford in 1943 hoping to make it as a novelist. Instead he fell into librarianship, moving from a small town's stacks to academic library work at Leicester, Belfast, and then to unglamorous Hull, where he stayed. He did publish two literary novels, Jill (1946), the tale of a shy undergraduate's self-defeating fantasies, and A Girl in Winter (1947), a bleaker book about postadolescent resignation. Success, when it came, came slowly, and only for his verse. The Less Deceived (1955) placed Larkin at the head of the class of modest, grim young English poets known as the Movement. (The Anglo-American poet Thom Gunn, who died this April, was once grouped with the Movement too.) With poems about slow trains, old boarding schools, and village World War I commemorations, The Whitsun Weddings (1964) made Larkin a poet of undoubted influence; High Windows (1974), which included "This Be the Verse," made him famous. (He later turned down the job of poet laureate.)  The same book made him the poet of dirty words. "Sad Steps" begins with the poet "Groping back to bed after a piss." The title poem opens: "Whenever I see a couple of kids/ And guess he's fucking her and she's/ Taking pills or wearing a diaphragm …" The Dutch painting in "The Card Players" depicts "Jan van Hogspeuw," "Dirk Dogstoerd" and "Old Prijck." "Vers de Societe" starts by rejecting an invitation to a cocktail party: "In a pig's arse, friend." Larkin published only nine poems after 1974; the longest, "Aubade," begins "I work all day, and get half-drunk at night." Few poets—not even Larkin's own model, Thomas Hardy (whose prolific output belied his gloom)—insist so profoundly on their antisocial bent. How could a poet so cranky find such a broad public—find himself not only admired, but embraced?  Such questions gained momentum after his death. Andrew Motion's 1993 biography, Philip Larkin: A Writer's Life, showed that the man who depicted himself as lonely and sexually unfulfilled in fact maintained a complex, even duplicitous, heterosexual love life, with one long-term romance that began in Leicester, another in Belfast, and a third with his assistant in Hull. Larkin's letters revealed not only a collector of dirty pictures but a man whose right-wing opinions sometimes accompanied flagrantly racist language. Larkin's epithets joined Eliot's arguable anti-Semitism and Pound's undoubted fascism as fuel for the over-familiar debate: Can a bad man be a good poet?  We might add: Can a pornographer? Trouble at Willow Gables (2001), a volume that gathered his unpublished fiction, included false starts at a third literary novel. But what it got attention for instead was the title novella, a tale of hijinks, same-sex crushes, and mild BDSM in a girls' school. Larkin wrote Trouble during his last year at Oxford, sharing it only with close friends; its supposed author, "Brunette Coleman," also penned a sequel set in a women's college and a series of poems and essays about girls'-school life. British reviewers panned Trouble as amateur porn—and disappointingly mild porn at that. In fact (as editor James Booth took pains to make clear), the "Coleman" oeuvre shows surprisingly diligent attention to the tradition of girls'-school fiction, aimed at women and girls (and certainly not pornographic), that flourished in the early 20th century: Larkin worked hard to master the genre, even as he steered his own entries toward the risqué.  These revelations would make any reader long for a sense of Larkin's career as a whole. Yet that is what neither the new nor the old Collected can provide. "Such attics cleared of me! Such absences!" one 1950 poem concludes: Readers of the new edition might echo those words. The new book lacks sad earlier gems such as "Autobiography at an Air-Station" (i.e., airport): "in the race for seats/ You're best alone. Friendship is not worth while." Also missing is the frequently anthologized "Love Again," Larkin's last (and most painful) expression of loneliness: That poem begins with the poet "wanking at ten past three," imagining his former paramour with her new partner, and tries to find out "why [love] never worked for me." The new book may not even reflect the poet's wishes—though some will surely argue that it does. If Larkin meticulously held some poems back because he thought them inferior, he may well have expected others—especially late poems like "Love Again"—to see print after his demise.   Yet the new edition has new virtues. By restoring the order of poems within Larkin's original books, the new Collected shows how Larkin chose to present himself, and hence how his cranky moments and contradictions make sense after all. From Willow Gables to "The Winter Garden," from slow-train England to Dirk Dogstoerd's Netherlands, each of his books reacts to the communities—of girls and women, of ordinary workers, vacationers, pubgoers—from which he felt excluded, communities he pre-emptively mocked (even swore at) but pursued, studied, admired, and envied anyway. The Whitsun Weddings, for example, opens with "Here," a generous description of Hull and its suburbs, then zeroes in on "Mr. Bleaney," the most famous and most depressing of Larkin's alter egos, a lonely bachelor in a rented room.   It should be no surprise that the man who wrote "The Importance of Elsewhere" wrote both to attract readers and to push them away, to justify his solitude and to assuage it. This author who feared commitment in his life sought to juxtapose charm and venom, sympathy and self-isolating acerbity, in all he wrote. And once you see those clashes within his books, you may well see them inside single stories and poems. The Coleman writings about girls schools let Larkin imagine himself at once "a real girl in a real place" (to quote one of his poems) and a jocular man writing for men. And within the poems, the swearwords balance out—or make emotionally possible—moments of transcendental acceptance.   A perfect Collected Poems of Philip Larkin would reprint all four of his books, followed by uncollected, and then by unpublished, writings, from undergraduate writings through the last papers; standard editions of several modern poets (such as Wallace Stevens) follow just that pattern. Instead, we have two different unsatisfactory books. (Rumor has it that in Britain both will remain in print.) With poems in Larkin's own orderings, the new edition makes the surest introduction to him. Yet to find the strength and pain of being Larkin undiminished, readers will need to track down the older book too.    Stephen Burt teaches at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn. He is the author of Popular Music and of Randall Jarrell and His Age.

						    urlLink The New York Times > Opinion > Op-Ed Columnist: Shoulda, Woulda, Can   Shoulda, Woulda, Can By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN  Published: May 27, 2004  'm glad the president gave a sober talk about where we're going in Iraq and in confronting terrorism. But I can't say I found it reassuring. I still don't feel we have a broad, workable strategy. We currently have two national commissions looking backward — one on how 9/11 happened, and another about why no W.M.D. were found in Iraq. Those are key questions. But what we really need is a bipartisan commission looking forward. I'd call it the National Commission for Doing Things Right. Its mandate would be simple: tell the country what U.S. policy would be if we were determined to do things right in confronting terrorism, no matter what the political costs — so we don't have to have yet another commission looking backward two years from now. Here's what I'd like to see:  • We would take all the money the Bush team has wasted on P.R. campaigns directed at the Arab-Muslim world and put it into three programs: a huge expansion of U.S. embassy libraries around the world, which have been cut in recent years (you'd be amazed at how many young people abroad had their first contact with America through an embassy library), a huge expansion of scholarships for foreign students to study in America, and a huge expansion of our immigration service so it can quickly figure out who should get visas to study or work in America and who shouldn't. Too many good students are getting shut out of the U.S. You don't get better P.R. from ads. You get it from bringing people into America or American libraries and letting them draw their own conclusions.   • We would adopt a 50-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax, the Patriot Tax (along with my wife's proposal: free public parking anywhere in America for any hybrid or other car getting more than 35 m.p.g.). A Patriot Tax would help pay for the Afghan and Iraq wars and help finance a Manhattan project to speed the development of a hydrogen economy, enabling the public to make a contribution to the war effort while lessening our dependence on foreign oil.  There is simply no way to stimulate a process of economic and political reform in the Arab-Muslim world without radically reducing their revenues from oil, thereby forcing these governments to reform their economies, and societies, to produce real jobs for their people. Is there anything dumber than the Bush campaign ads chastising John Kerry for once favoring a gasoline tax? Had we imposed a Patriot Tax a year ago, gasoline might still cost $2 a gallon today, but 50 cents of that would have gone to paying for American schools rather than Saudi madrassas.  • We would spearhead efforts in trade talks to reduce U.S., European and Japanese farm subsidies. Nothing would be more helpful to Pakistani, Egyptian and other poor farmers in the Muslim and developing worlds than no longer having to compete with our subsidized produce.  • We would make a serious effort to diffuse the toxic Arab-Israeli conflict, including using NATO forces to separate the parties.  • We would spell out that the war on terrorism is a long-term war on radical Islam — and while force is necessary in that effort, it is not sufficient. We have to connect all of the above dots to strengthen Arab-Muslim moderates, because only they can take on their extremists. Unfortunately, the Bush team reacted to 9/11 as if all the old rules and methods had to go. I believe 9/11 was gigantic. But the old rule book — emphasizing allies, the Geneva Conventions, self-sacrifice, economic development, education, Arab-Israeli diplomacy — was and remains our greatest source of strength in the effort to promote gradual reform in the regions most likely to breed threats to our open society.   I think David Rothkopf, a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said it best: "The answer for us lies not in what has changed, but in recognizing what has not changed. Because only through this recognition will we focus on an effective multilateral response to W.M.D. proliferation, the creation of real stakeholders in globalization among the world's poor, the need for reform in the Arab world and a style of U.S. leadership that seeks to build our base of support worldwide by getting more people to voluntarily sign onto our values. We need to remember that those values are the real foundation for our security and the real source of our strength. And we need to recognize that our enemies can never defeat us — only we can defeat ourselves, by throwing out the rule book that has worked for us for a long, long time."

						    urlLink THE SPEAKING TREE The Atheistic Roots of Hindu Philosophy - The Times of India   The Atheistic Roots of Hindu Philosophy MAHESH DAGA  [ SATURDAY, MAY 22, 2004 12:00:05 AM ]   The core of Hindu scriptural tradition, it is commonly thought, is all about theism or belief in God. But that is a huge misconception. Even disregarding the ‘heterodox’ streams like the charvaks, with their underlying message of materialist hedonism, or Buddhism, the philosophical canon — call it higher Hinduism — leaves plenty of room for dissent even on a question as central as the existence of God.   Indeed, the reason why some schools of darshana — Purva and Uttar Mimansa, Sankhya and Yoga, Nyaya and Vaisheshika — are regarded as ‘orthodox’ and others such as Jainism,    Buddhism and Charvaks are not, has little or nothing to do with a belief in God. The real point of departure is whether or not a particular system of thought accepts the Vedas as the ultimate source of philosophical authority. The  so-called orthodox schools do — even though it has been convin-cingly argued that this acceptance is more notional than real — while the other three don’t. Significantly, the original meanings of the terms astika and nastika, too, hinge on this vital diffe-rence. While the astikas believe in the veracity and infallibility of the Vedas, the nastikas clearly don’t.   Among the astikas, the two oldest schools — San-khya and Purva Mimansa — strongly refute the theory of God. Thus, the source book for Sankhya darshan, Ishwar Krishan’s Sankhya Karika, is full of subtle arguments which reject the possibility of there being an all-powerful creator and controller of the world. Vigyan Bhikshu’s Sankhya Pravachna Bhashya makes a case for why a belief in the divine principle is unwarranted. Even Kapila’s classic treatise on the subject, which is far less emphatic in its rejection of God, finds it unnecessary to accept any theistic assumptions.   Similarly, Purva Mimansa has a strong element of disbelief at its core. Jaimini’s Mimansa Sutra, the founding text, is mostly preoccupied with proving the efficacy and power of Yagna (or sacrificial fire) but shies away from attributing it to any divinity. Instead, in common with latter Miman-saks like Kumarila, Jaimini takes delight in rejecting the God hypothesis. In Yoga — beginning with Patanjali’s Yoga Sutra — which is widely regarded as theistic in nature, the acceptance of God is, in part, purely verbal. In large areas of practical reasoning, God is happily overlooked, if not consciously ignored. In Nyaya, the quint-essential Indian tradition of formal logic, there is an attempt to prove, as in Jayanta Bhatt’s Nyaya Manjari, the existence of God, but such arguments are far from being universally accepted.   The only ‘God-fearing’ candidate among the orthodox schools is  perhaps Uttar Mimansa, of which Shankara’s ad-vaita or vedantic philosophy is the best known example. But, contrary to received wisdom, Shankara was never accepted, either by his contemporaries or latter-day thin-kers, as the be all and end all of Indian thought. It was only in the 19th century, thanks to the need of the  native intellectuals to create the image of an ‘essentially’ spiritual India as opposed to an equally materialist West, that Shankara’s advaita came to be regarded as the pinnacle of Indian philosophical achievement.     Interestingly, atheism in the Indian tradition is not necessarily premised on a prior acceptance of materialism, either in the philosophical or everyday sense. All the atheistic schools mentioned above, even when they reject God, accept the existence of a permanent soul (atman), which is quite distinct from corporeal or physical reality. If anything, Indian atheism — except in the case of the charvaks — is strongly anti-materialistic  in character.

						    urlLink India's New Era (washingtonpost.com)   India's New Era   By Salman Rushdie Friday, May 14, 2004; Page A25    The fall of the Indian government is a huge political shock that strikingly echoes the only comparable electoral upset, the defeat of Indira Gandhi in 1977. Then as now, just about the entire commentariat was convinced that the incumbent would win; then as now, the opposition was widely written off; then as now, India's voters left the politicians and media with egg on their faces. Both elections are high points in the history of Indian democracy. An ornery electorate that doesn't do what it's supposed to do is a fine and cheering thing.   In the 21/2 years before the 1977 election, Gandhi's autocratic "emergency" regime, initiated after she was found guilty of electoral malpractice in 1975, had been guilty of many civil and human rights abuses, including forced sterilizations and vasectomies. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was not by any means a dictatorship, but its leaders have turned a blind eye to some terrible deeds, notably the mass killings, mainly of Muslims, in the state of Gujarat, where the BJP-led state government itself is accused of a role in the slaughter of 2002. The Congress Party's success in Gujarat suggests that voters have been sickened by what they have seen, just as Gandhi's fall in 1977 was an expression of national disgust at her government's brutalities.   The oldest Indian rivalries of all have resurfaced in this election, as they also did in 1977. Then as now, much of the urban bourgeoisie voted for the government, while the impoverished Indian masses, in particular the rural poor, mostly voted against it. The Indian battle for centrality in the debate about the country's future has always been, to some degree, a battle between the city and the village. It is between, on the one hand, the urbanized, industrialized India favored by both the socialist-inclined Jawaharlal Nehru and the free-market architects of "India Shining," the new India in which a highly successful capitalist class has transformed the heights of the economy; and, on the other hand, the agricultural, homespun India beloved of Mahatma Gandhi, the immense countryside India where three-quarters of the population still lives and which has not benefited in the slightest from the recent economic boom.   It's no accident that the ruling alliance lost heavily in Andhra Pradesh and in Tamil Nadu, precisely the states that wooed information technology giants such as Microsoft to set up shop, turning sleepy "second cities" such as Madras, Bangalore and Hyderabad into new-tech boom towns. That's because while the rich got richer, the fortunes of the poor, such as the farmers of Andhra, declined year by year. The gulf between India's rich and poor has never looked wider than it does today, and the government has fallen into that chasm.   The failure of the NDA's ubiquitous "India Shining" slogan has backfired just as, in Indira Gandhi's hour of defeat, her grandiose slogan Garibi Hatao -- "remove poverty" -- was successfully rewritten by her opponents as Indira Hatao -- "remove Indira."   India's business elite has hastened to welcome the Congress victory, and we shall have to see how the change of government affects market confidence. But the dispossessed of India have dealt a mighty blow to the assumptions of the country's political and economic chieftains, and the lesson should be learned by all parties: Ignore the well-being of the masses at your peril.   I have two immediate wishes for the new era. The first is that the debates about "foreignness" can be laid to rest. Those of us who are part of the Indian diaspora, and who have fought for years to have Indians recognized as full citizens of the societies in which we have settled and in which our children have been born and raised, have found the attack on the Italian origins of Sonia Gandhi, the Congress Party's leader and widow of the slain prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, to be highly unpleasant. Even more unpleasant were the BJP's suggestions that her children, the children of Rajiv Gandhi, were also somehow aliens. You can't have it both ways. If Indians outside India are to be seen as "belonging" to their new homelands, then those who make India their home, as Sonia Gandhi has done for 40 years or so, must be given the same respect. Gratifyingly, the electorate has shown it just doesn't care about the "foreignness" issue. A BJP leader foolishly said in the immediate aftermath of his party's rejection that he thought it "shameful" that India might be led by a foreigner. Such slurs are part of the reason for the BJP defeat. They are essentially racist, and must cease.   My second wish is that the study of India's history can now be rescued from the extremists and ideologues. The outgoing government's politicization of historical scholarship -- its determination to impose textbooks peddling a narrow, revisionist, Hindu-nationalist vision of India's past on the country's schools and colleges, and its deriding of the work of the greatest Indian historians, such as Professor Romila Thapar -- was one of its most alarming initiatives. The BJP has often seemed to want to inflame our perceptions of the past in order to inflame the passions of the present. Congress and its allies have it in their power to restore the atmosphere of cool objectivity that true learning requires.   Delightful as it is to watch democracy on such a scale in action, one doesn't have to give the new government an unreserved welcome. Time will tell whether this new coalition will hold or disintegrate. The Congress Party will have to relearn the arts of government after the long wilderness years, and Sonia Gandhi -- who has proved she has the stomach for the fight -- will have to prove that she is not just keeping the leader's seat warm for her son or daughter to inherit, that she is a true, unifying leader.   Time will tell, too, whether the defeated BJP casts off, in opposition, the velvet glove of moderation that Vajpayee imposed during its time of power, and reinvents itself as a hard-line communalist force. If that happens the years ahead could be full of conflict and violence.   Meanwhile, we can enjoy this rare moment of hope.   The writer is a novelist and essayist. His latest book is "Step Across This Line," a collection of essays.

						    urlLink The New York Times > Opinion > Op-Ed Columnist: Making India Shine   Making India Shine By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN  Published: May 20, 2004  ndia just had a stunning election, with incumbents across the country thrown out, largely by rural voters. Clearly rural Indians, who make up the country's majority, were telling the cities and the government that they were not happy with the direction of events. I think I can explain what happened, but first I have to tell you about this wild typing race I recently had with an 8-year-old Indian girl at a village school.  The Shanti Bhavan school sits on a once-scorpion-infested bluff about an hour's drive — and 10 centuries — from Bangalore, India's Silicon Valley. The students are all "untouchables," the lowest caste in India, who are not supposed to even get near Indians of a higher caste for fear they will pollute the air others breathe. The Shanti Bhavan school, with 160 students, was started by Abraham George, one of those brainy Indians who made it big in high-tech America. He came back to India with a single mission: to start a privately financed boarding school that would take India's most deprived children and prove that if you gave them access to the same technologies and education that have enabled other Indians to thrive in globalization, they could, too.  I visited Mr. George's school in February, and he took me to a classroom where 8-year-old untouchables were learning to use Microsoft Word and Excel. They were having their computer speed-typing lesson, so I challenged the fastest typist to a race. She left me in the dust — to the cheering delight of her classmates.  "Dust" is an appropriate word, because a drought in this area of southern India has left dust everywhere. "These kids — their parents are ragpickers, coolies and quarry laborers," said the school's principal, Lalita Law. "They come from homes below the poverty line, and from the lowest caste of untouchables, who are supposed be fulfilling their destiny and left where they are — according to the unwritten laws of Indian society. We get these children at age 4. They don't know what it is to have a drink of clean water [or use a toilet]. They bathe in filthy gutter water — if they are lucky to have a gutter near where they live. They don't even have proper scraps of clothing. We have to start by socializing them. When we first get them, they run out and urinate and defecate wherever they want. [At first] we don't make them sleep on beds because it is a culture shock. Our goal is to give them a world-class education so they can aspire to careers and professions that would have been totally beyond their reach, and have been so for generations."  After our little typing race, I asked the 8-year-olds what they wanted to be. Their answers were: "an astronaut," "a doctor," "a pediatrician," "a poetess," "physics and chemistry," "a scientist and an astronaut," "a surgeon," "a detective," "an author." Looking at these kids, Mr. George said, "They are the ones who have to do well for India to succeed." (See his Web site, www.tgfworld.org.)  And that brings us to the lesson of India's election: the broad globalization strategy that India opted for in the early 1990's has succeeded in unlocking the country's incredible brainpower and stimulating sustained growth, which is the best antipoverty program. I think many Indians understand that retreating from their globalizing strategy now would be a disaster and result in India's neighborhood rival, China, leaving India in the dust. But the key to spreading the benefits of globalization across a big society is not about more Internet. It is about getting your fundamentals right: good governance, good education. India's problem is not too much globalization, but too little good governance. Local government in India — basic democracy — is so unresponsive and so corrupted it can't deliver services and education to rural Indians. As an Indian political journalist, Krishna Prasad, told me: "The average Indian voter is not saying, `No more reforms,' as the left wants to believe, but, `More reforms, please' — genuine reforms, reforms that do not just impact the cities and towns, but ones which percolate down to the grass roots as well."  India needs a political reform revolution to go with its economic one. "With prosperity coming to a few, the great majority are simply spectators to this drama," said Mr. George. "The country is governed poorly, with corruption and heavy bureaucracy at all levels. I am a great advocate of technology and globalization, but we must find a way to channel their benefits to the rural poor. What is happening today will not succeed because we are relying on a corrupt and socially unfair system."

						    urlLink New York Post Online Edition: postopinion   INDIA: DEMOCRACY WINS   By RALPH PETERS   May 18, 2004 -- IN last week's elections, the world's largest democracy - India - booted an economically progressive, peace-seeking government that had supported the United States to a degree unprecedented for New Delhi, and returned a notoriously corrupt party of obsolete demagogues to power.  It was a triumph for democracy, and good news for America.   With Iraq demanding the media's attention, the slight commentaries on India's elections thus far have described a strategic setback for America, given the victorious Congress party's role in forming the anti-American "Non-aligned Movement" half a century ago.   But the Non-aligned Movement is long dead - and it was never more than half alive. Yes, we'll hear some silly anti-American rhetoric from Congress Party demagogues. But pay attention to what the new government does, not to what it says. Despite the inevitable turbulence attending a change of governments, there is likely to be more continuity in New Delhi than disruption in dealing with the United States.   The current relationship between India and the United States is mutually beneficial, with virtually no downside. The likely new prime minister, Italian-born Sonia Gandhi, is unlikely to kill the goose that keeps laying golden eggs. Expect some feather-plucking in public and some goose-baiting at the United Nations. But don't expect General Electric to be sent packing from Bangalore.   Analysts have also read the election returns as the vote of an underdeveloped countryside against the techno-privileged boom cities, with their prosperous, envy-inducing mix of saris, jeans and singles' bars. Such jealousy no doubt shaped part of the vote - even though the poverty level in the countryside has been steadily declining. Trickle-down economics work, but in a country as vast, populous and poor as India, it takes longer than it does on Long Island.   In a sense, the outgoing government was a victim of its success. The techno-boom in cities such as Hyderabad, New Delhi, Chennai/Madras and even vibrant, appalling Mumbai/Bombay has raised expectations and job envy throughout the country. But no political party could deliver progress at a pace sufficient to fully satisfy the country's pressing needs.      We will likely see continued changes of government as dramatic economic progress nonetheless continues to exclude hundreds of millions of Indians.   Yet, having spent a few months wandering throughout that fascinating country a few years ago, I like to think there was another, crucial factor at work at the polls. The surprise upset of the outgoing government - formed by the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - likely also had to do with the disenchantment of India's burgeoning middle class - the techno-yuppies and entrepreneurs - who were mortified by the anti-Muslim pogroms in the state of Gujarat a few years ago.   Young, educated Indians, especially, felt shamed in the eyes of the world. But the BJP government did virtually nothing to investigate the mass murders or to prosecute those responsible. Instead, the government blamed the victims.   It was a reminder that, for all its liberal economic policies and diplomatic openings, the BJP was grotesquely reactionary on the home front, reigniting not only interfaith but also caste hatreds. The hard-right "Hindutva" or "Hinduness" wing of the BJP is bigoted, ugly and anti-modern, led by ideologues whose extremism is far more dangerous to India and the region than the effete, decayed socialism of the Congress Party.   Yes, the old government opened new doors to cooperation with the United States. Yes, they sought a meaningful peace with Pakistan. Without question, their programs of fostering techno-trade and privatizing moribund state industries were essential. But the hatred they preached in city and village threatened to become a domestic cancer that might have canceled all else.   I believe that some Indians, at least, voted for simple decency. And freedom. And a national unity that includes India's 150 million Muslims.   The BJP government satisfied our immediate interests. But, for all its other failings, the Congress Party shares far more American values: religious freedom, social equality and big-tent democracy.   India is a remarkable, frustrating, inspiring, infuriating country of almost unlimited human potential. No matter which party takes office in New Delhi, our human ties will continue to expand - to the benefit of all. Indeed, today's Indian-American community is among the most productive immigrant groups in U.S. history - and the values and possibilities they learn in America are having a positive influence back in India.   Expect occasionally nasty rhetoric from the new government in New Delhi as it reaccustoms itself to holding power in a much-changed world. Like many developing countries, India remains in a political transition phase. The old-guard pols, with their left-wing slogans and grasping paws, need to die off and make room for a new generation of educated technocrats. And they will.   Don't worry about the return of the Gandhi dynasty. And don't worry about outdated anti-American rhetoric that may boom from New Delhi. America and India are bound to cooperate. Our futures are intertwined - as the world's two most populous democracies.   Meanwhile, we Americans should applaud any country with such a long and continuing tradition of open elections. In the end, democracy abroad always benefits the United States - even if the results disappoint us in the short term (as they may do in Iraq).   Against great odds, India has come so far that no government, right or left, will be able to stop its progress. If they try and the Indian economy slows, well, just wait for the next election.

						    urlLink THE SPEAKING TREE Goodness, a Lighter State of Being - The Times of India   Who is a good human being? Charles Dickens said people were good and bad. But he couldn’t figure out what made them that way. Unfortunately, Dickens missed — by about 50 years — the revolution in psychology brought about by Sigmund Freud. Freud believed an individual’s personality was shaped in his infancy, with later influences having only a negligible impact. However, Freud erred in focusing on natural instincts to the exclusion of social structures.   A good human being is honest to himself and sensitive to the needs of others. An emotionally honest person is a product of an upbringing that infuses a sense of self-worth. People can lack self-worth because of some kind of Freudian rejection in their infancy. To overcome their feeling of smallness or insecurity they control, even with good intentions, those emotionally or socially weaker than them. The oppressed tend to control those still more vulnerable, to overcome their misery. Hence, a chain of power is established in family and social relations. Control distorts love and goodness. It is exercised through psychological manipulation, or through the social hierarchy.   The good individual stands liberated from the control chain, from thought systems that divide people. He tends to be free of malice, fear, and inner turmoil — all of which arise from carrying the burden of the past. The past can be overcome only by coming to terms with it. Here, Freud’s contribution to the betterment of the human condition is invaluable.   Some people are guileless or benign, but lack the individuality that stems from reason. They tend to grasp the scaffolding of social control. As a result, they are unable to make an objective assessment in many situations. The light of goodness in them is clouded by unreason.  The thrust of control is blunted by the element of   responsibility and care in family and social relationships. Popular culture has aspects that are a deep source of strength to an individual, such as religious               occasions, customs and festivals. These events are parti-cularly liberating for the socially and emotionally weak. Those rooted, yet liberated from enemy constructs, are the children of God.      The urge to control can turn into cunning, or a nihi-lism that does not respect emotional and social bonds. Such an individual is cynical and insecure, his actions no longer guided by concern or responsibility. His freedom is a form of bondage where his angst of non-belonging devours his inner being. He is a lone scarecrow fluttering in the wind. But every cynic is a potential saint, just as Valmiki was a robber before he encountered the sapta-rishis. When the hand of the guru does not arrive, he marches down an evil road.   The good individual is an ardhanarishwar, possessing in the right measure the traditional masculine attributes of fearlessness and direction and the feminine traits of compassion and accommodation. But to have the right instincts                 all through life and avoid attrition of inner strength, he needs a supportive social order. Goodness is compromised in societies that do not respect the inner freedom of the individual. When Rabindranath Tagore said ekla chalo re, he wanted individuals to be free when they negotiated with society.    The free individual needs to engage constantly with society to maintain his freedom. The flux in this negotiation — “neither this nor that” — in Upanishadic terms embodies the richness of existence. No wonder Kabir fused individual goodness with social emancipation. Renunciation should not be confused with running away.

						    urlLink LEADER ARTICLE Saffron Offensive: 'Videshi' Bahu Stands Tall - The Times of India   Videshi no more and a True Gandhian all the more!   'Videshi' Bahu Stands Tall [ WEDNESDAY, MAY 19, 2004 12:00:15 AM ]   The largely peaceful conduct of our elections, followed by the smooth and swift transfer of power, attested to the robust health of our democracy. Sonia Gandhi’s ascension to the post of prime minister would have been a triumph for our Republic. Its ideals, rooted in all that is progressive and sublime in the spirit of India , would have been vindicated. The people of India, out of their own free will, had chosen to repose their faith in her leadership disregarding the racial, cultural, religious and gender ‘givens’ of her birth.   The sangh parivar was, however, unwilling to acknowledge this choice which is not only legitimate in terms of the Constitution but which also bears the stamp of the loftiest Vedantic thought inscribed at the entrance of Parliament House: ‘All the world is one family’. The concept of the alien or the ‘other’ belongs to the category of debilitating dualities. It is doubtless difficult to escape them altogether in the practical world where man-made, and hence transitory, constructs like the nation, the state and the market rules the roost. But an awareness about the dualities enables us to gain a broader, more humane perspective of events agitating the world.   None of this seemed to matter for the sangh parivar. It embarked on a smear campaign against Sonia Gandhi’s choice as prime minister. This threatened to wreak havoc for our democracy and our Republic alike. Already, a BJP activist in Karnataka had allegedly committed suicide; he is reported to have been aggrieved beyond measure over the possibility of a ‘foreigner’ occupying the most powerful post in the country. People resort to such desperate acts when the atmosphere is vitiated with feelings of hate and vengeance.   The saffron offensive began with the announcement by Sushma Swaraj that she and her husband, Swaraj Kaushal, will resign from Parliament if Mrs Gandhi dons the prime minister’s mantle. Mrs Swaraj indeed declared that she will tonsure her head and remain in ‘mourning’ so long as Mrs Gandhi remains in office. This would have been a sad day on more than one count. If nothing else, Sushma Swaraj should have known that Hindu reformers have decried this form of mourning as a humiliation of widows.   Also vitiating the atmosphere was the RSS ideologue, K N Govindacharya, who launched a movement against Mrs Gandhi taking over as prime minister. In his view such a development would “undo the very identity of Bharat as a nation and of Bharatiyas as a people...” Another saffron activist, S Gurumurthy , went so far as to say that the presence of a ‘foreigner’ at the pinnacle of power in the country would be tantamount to a “psychological conversion of India into a colony”. Gurumurthy’s  concerns were not confined to Mrs Gandhi. He feared that her ‘foreign’ rule would               continue under Rahul Gandhi.   What all this denotes is a meanness of spirit and a contempt for the law of the land. Once again, the sangh parivar placed ‘public sentiment’, derived from its spooky idea of India , beyond the pale of both democracy and the Constitution. This is cause for anxiety because well over 300 MPs endorsed Mrs Gandhi’s candidature to the post of prime minister. The sangh parivar’s campaign would seem to suggest that these elected representatives of the people are lacking in patriotic fibre. Such reasoning spells disaster for the unity and integrity of the country. The BJP leadership needed to summon the nerve to exercise prudence. Atal Behari Vajpayee’s address to the nation after the NDA’s defeat in the election generated a good deal of praise. What he said, and the way he said it, gave hope that the BJP and its allies could be trusted to act as a mature and responsible Opposition.   But the leadership chose to change tack. It decided to fall in line with the hardliners of the sangh parivar on the issue of Sonia Gandhi’s foreign origins. Add to this its move to boycott the swearing-in ceremony of the new government. None of this is consistent with the democratic spirit or with the values of the Republic — respect for pluralism, commitment to  social justice, freedom of the individual. And so it is that in what could have been its hour of glory, in the deepest philosophical sense, Indian democracy was confronted with an unprecedented threat from obscurantist and authoritarian forces.   The threat indeed seemed to have worked when word went around on Tuesday afternoon that Sonia Gandhi had refused the prime minister’s job. But it would not be accurate to state that this alone accounts for her step. She has all along held that she wasn’t in politics to gain power for herself. Her ambition was to revive the Congress party. And to this end she deployed her talents and energies with results that are there for all to see. Her biggest success, of course, was the defeat of the BJP-led NDA.   Having achieved her aims, she doubtless reckoned that her presence in the prime minister’s chair would provide the obscurantists with the pretext to create more fissures in Indian society. Her opting out would be in line with the one value that Indians cherish over any other: the value of renunciation. She will stand taller than the moral pygmies who have been baying for her blood.   More than any self-proclaimed guardian of Bharatiyata, Sonia Gandhi will have demonstrated her Indianness with  dazzling aplomb.

						    urlLink TODAY'S EDITORIAL Power of Sacrifice - The Times of India   Not connected to Gandhi through genes, but definitely in spirit.   Power of Sacrifice  [ WEDNESDAY, MAY 19, 2004 12:00:27 AM ]   Whichever way you looked at Election-2004, it belonged to only one person: Sonia Gandhi. The Congress president fought the most daunting odds to give her party the kind of victory no one ever imagined. The Congress came back from behind to emerge with the highest vote share and the largest number of seats. But more remarkably, she won the unanimous support of over 300 legislators, among them men who had earlier opposed her on grounds of her foreign origin. Sonia had a mandate way beyond anything the outgoing government enjoyed in its five years in office. By all canons of democracy — and decency — she ought to have been sworn in as India ’s next prime minister. That things have turned out differently is an adverse comment, not on the democratic credentials of this wonderful country and the large masses of its people, but on the behaviour of a handful of men and women who, through sheer political blackmail, have sought to reverse the electoral mandate. It is a sad day for India . And yet, even if regretfully, we must accept her decision. By stepping aside to make way for another candidate, Sonia has emulated a tradition of renunciation that, ironically, has long been held to be the pinnacle of Indian civilisational thought.      Sonia can rest assured, though, that her stock will go up — as much here as internationally. By the same token, those in the BJP and the RSS who have spearheaded a hate campaign against her, must know that they have come out of this sordid drama looking like street bullies: The display of shakti by Sushma Swaraj and Uma Bharti did little for the famed maryada of the Hindutva parivar. This is all the more unfortunate considering the nature of the electoral verdict which was unambiguously against this kind of xenophobia. However, such is the politics of blackmail that it spares no one. It won’t be long before these hoodlum tactics rebound on the political class and the country. We have seen a manifestation of this in the  behaviour of the stock market in the last few days. Clearly, the record fall of the Sensex by 564 points on Monday and its instant recovery within minutes of information that Sonia will be stepping down, cannot be explained in purely market terms. That markets should play such a role, by design or default, in the formation of government bodes ill both for our democracy and the future of free enterprise. This is a travesty of the larger ideals that capitalism,  globalisation and democracy represent.

						   PETRO-DOLLAR I$LAM   Millions of Muslims across the globe, Have forced upon themselves, A false religion and a false hope, Thanks to the Saudi Oilwells, Deedats, Bucaille's  and  Osama!  Just take a look at what they have to face, In homes, in mosques and even cyberspace, The Maulvis, the Muftis and the Ulema!  They always arrive in greedy hordes, They are definitely worse than whores, The Qazis, the Imams and the Mullah!  Their brains are Frozen, but their Pockets are open, They refuse to Think, incapable of Reason. But the One thing they hate most often,  Is the Independent Mind, the freedom loving person. Beware of the Sinister Fatwa!  Using  Hadith, Sunnah and a fake Shariah, With the consensus of their evil Ijma, The Hanfi, Shafi, Sunni and Shia, Try to Kill liberals from their Ummah. Just look at Salman Rushdie of India!  They insist on blundering,  They dont mind plundering, You will catch them parroting,  With no grasp of meaning, After every Murder and every Stoning, "All praise and glory belongs to Allah!"   Their terrible presence is sadly, neverending. Their appearance is like wolves in sheep's clothing. They claim to protect the flock, And watch them round the clock. But the wolves eat the sheep, As the shepherd pretends to sleep. Yes, its the same old story you have been hearing. Its tragic and funny, and worth repeating. "If anything goes wrong, just put the blame on America!"  Their beards are long, their minarets are tall, Their trousers short and their hearts are small. They welcome the terrorists, TwentyFour - Seven. They justify suicide bombing and September Eleven. They are like vultures, circling the sky. Like hungry hawks, always on the pry. Yes, they will never forget to shout and call,  "O Muslims, there is paradise for you all!" "But you just might end up in Hell instead of Jannah!"  Look out Saied! The Salafis are scheming, Their cries are vile, their wives behind a veil.. From Delhi to Seattle, Sydney to Durban, Their reach is spreading, even to London. They are against freedom, their minds in a turban, They now want to fool the average American. Look out People! The Salafis are preaching,  "The women must wear the hijab or else they are evil." In Islamic Centres, this is called DAWAH!  They will lie to you , they will spy on you, they will greet you with a loud Salam! They may not have a moustache, They may not have a gun. Their sword may be in a sheath, But they have a forked tongue. Among all the demons that will pounce on you, BEWARE of  Petro-dollar I$LAM! If you want to drive them away, just say, Aouzubillah!  End       Glossary of  words the average reader will be unfamiliar with (in order of appearance in the poem) :  Deedat : Ahmed Deedat, popular "Hadith thumping" Muslim preacher who polarised moslems and christians in South Africa.  Bucaille : Maurice Bucaille , author of "Bible, Quran and Islam" a popular book in the Islamic World.Responsible for spreading the "islam and science" myths among western nations.  Osama : Evil  terrorist who is responsible for 911 attack and symbolises Terrorism.  Maulvi, Mufti, Ulema, Qazi, Imam, Mullah : Different names given to religious leaders, scholars and judges in the Islamic World, who are more dangerous to Civilization than even the terrorists , the pawns created and bred  by these fundamentalist scholars.  Fatwa : Religious Decree or Order binding on hapless moslems.  Hadith : Islamic Traditions , which are of dubious origin. Moslems however, regard it as the second most sacred book after "Koran"(Islamic Bible), though in reality it supersedes koranic commandments.  Sunnah : The "practices of Prophet Mohammed" , derived from "Hadiths". Moslems regard "Stoning the adulterer and adulteress to death" as a Sunnah.  Shariah : Code of laws based on the dubious hadiths and sunnah.  Hanfi, Shafi : The two major subsects of Sunni Moslems  Sunni and Shia : The two major sects of Islam.  Ijma : The mysterious and sinister "consensus" of the "Scholars" where they can  even agree to STONE women to death!  Ummah : Means "community of muslims". Used here in context of demography.  Salman Rushdie : One of my favourite novelists and a Booker prize Winner, who was given a "Fatwa of death" for "insulting" Islam in his bestseller Fiction "Satanic Verses".  Jannah : Refers to the Moslem "Garden of Eden" or "Paradise"  Salafi : Followers of Wahabbism ( a rabid fundamentalist sect of Islam), sponsored by Saudi Arabia.They are the ideological defence team of the Al Qaieda.  Hijab : Head covering forced on Moslem Women , symbolises Oppression of women in the poem.  Dawah : Literally means "To Propogate" or "Spreading the Good Word"  Salam : Literally means "Peace".. a common greeting equal to hebrew Shalom.  Aouzubillah : arabic term means "seeking refuge in God from Satan"

						    urlLink The New York Times > Opinion > Op-Ed Columnist: Timeout for Imagination   Timeout for Imagination By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN  Published: June 27, 2004  This is my last column for three months. I'm taking a sabbatical to finish a book about geopolitics, called "The World Is Flat." It is not easy to take a timeout right now. But I want to step back and construct a better framework for myself to explain what's going on out there. Here's a few of the headlines I'd like to read while I'm gone.  Iraq's New Government Quashes Rebellion in Sunni Areas — Without the Help of U.S. Troops — Thanks to Intelligence Provided by Iraqis Themselves. I believe the main reason the Abu Ghraib prison scandal happened was because U.S. forces in Iraq were facing an uprising and had no intelligence. Too few Iraqis viewed us as legitimate or able to protect them, so they did not want to, or dare to, come forward with actionable intelligence about who was attacking us. As a result, some U.S. forces tried to beat it out of them. The big question I have going forward in Iraq is this: Now that a new, decent and diverse Iraqi government will have sovereignty, will Iraqis, particularly from the Sunni Triangle, come forward with the intelligence needed for Iraq's fledgling army to break the violent opposition in Iraq, largely on its own — that is, with the help of the Iraqi people and not us? If you see that happening, it means that enough Iraqi Sunnis are ready to sign on to the new Iraq. If you don't see that, it means that the only way the rebellion can be quashed is by heavy-handed tactics, which, if they come from U.S. forces, will only embarrass the new Iraqi government and if they come from the new Iraqi Army could trigger civil war. The Islamist opposition forces in Iraq are truly depraved. They will do anything to make sure America fails, including sacrificing all of Iraq. In the end, only Iraqis can root them out.  President Bush Stuns Electorate — Does His Own Version of Nixon to China and Announces Joint Chinese-American Crash Program for Developing Alternative Energies. Roughly 30,000 new cars merge onto the roads in Beijing every single month. Every day, the newspaper headlines in China are about energy shortages, blackouts and brownouts. U.S. officials estimate that 24 out of China's 31 provinces are now experiencing power shortages. China's foreign policy today consists of two things — Taiwan and searching for oil. China's oil imports jumped last year alone by 30 percent. This is not a healthy situation. Environmentally speaking, in 10 days in Beijing I saw blue sky once. The other days were a gray, polluted haze. Developmentally, China's growth is soon going to be restrained, if it isn't already, by a sheer shortage of energy. Strategically, China and America could soon find themselves in a dangerous head-to-head competition for fuel.   If there was ever a time for big imagination, it is now. What we need is for President Bush to surprise himself and the world and propose a grand China-U.S. Manhattan Project — a crash program to jointly develop clean alternative energies, bringing together China's best scientists and its ability to force pilot projects, with America's best brains, technology and money. "When it comes to renewable technology and sustainable energy, China could be the laboratory of the world — not just the workshop of the world," said Scott Roberts, Cambridge Energy Research Associates analyst in China. Why not?  Bush Administration Calls an End to the "War on Terrorism." No, I haven't taken leave of my senses on the way out the door. I realize that we have enemies and they need to be confronted. But I do not want this to be all that America is about in the world anymore, and that is what has happened under this administration. I don't want the rest of my career to be about an America that exports fear, not hope, and ends up importing everyone else's fears as a result. I don't want it to be about explaining to young Chinese why my government can't give them student visas anymore. I don't want it to be about visiting U.S. Embassies around the world and finding them so isolated behind barbed wire, they might as well not be there at all. Defeating "them" has begun to define "us" in too many ways.   America is so much more than just "Anti-Al-Qaeda Inc." — but our whole identity in the world, and too many aspects of our way of life, are getting contorted around that mission. If we're really having a relevant presidential campaign, I'll come back and find the candidates debating, not who is the "toughest" guy — the jungle is full of them — but who can be the toughest guy while preserving the best of what we had and the best of who we are.

						    urlLink The New York Times > Opinion > Op-Ed Columnist: Doing Our Homework   Doing Our Homework By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN  Published: June 24, 2004  DALIAN, China  When I was growing up, my parents used to say to me: "Finish your dinner — people in China are starving." I, by contrast, find myself wanting to say to my daughters: "Finish your homework — people in China and India are starving for your job."  That thought struck me in a visit to Dalian, a port city in northeastern China. It is not just impressive for a Chinese city. With its wide boulevards, beautiful green spaces and nexus of universities, technical colleges and a massive software park, Dalian would stand out in Silicon Valley.  Dalian symbolizes how much China's most modern cities — and there are still plenty of miserable, backward ones — are rapidly grabbing business as knowledge centers, not just manufacturing hubs. No, Toto, they are not just making tennis shoes here. Try G.E., Microsoft, Dell, SAP, H.P., Sony and Accenture, which are setting up back-room operations here for Asian companies and software R.& D. centers.  "I've taken a lot of American people to Dalian, and they are amazed at how fast the China economy is growing in this high-tech area," said Win Liu, director of U.S./E.U. projects for DHC, one of Dalian's biggest homegrown companies, which grew from 30 to 1,200 employees in six years. "Americans don't realize the challenge to the extent that they should. I do have confidence in the American people, though, to take the challenge."  Because of Japan's long colonization of this area in the first half of the 20th century, Dalian has a pool of people who know Japanese. And because of its proximity to Japan and its abundance of Internet bandwidth, and parks and golf courses that attract knowledge workers, Dalian has become the Bangalore of China — the center for outsourcing by Japanese businesses that want to tap China's low-cost brainpower. Japanese companies can hire three Chinese software engineers for the price of one in Japan, and still have change to buy a room full of call-center operators (starting salary: $90 a month).  Although Japan is still deeply resented for its wartime abuses in China, young Chinese have not let that stop them from working as data-entry technicians, software programmers or call-center operators for Japanese companies — some 2,800 have set up in Dalian — in order to get onto the first rung of the high-tech ladder.  "We have 22 universities and colleges with over 200,000 students in Dalian," the city's mayor, Xia Deren, told me. More than half graduate with engineering or science degrees, and even those who don't are directed to spend a year studying Japanese or English and computer science.   "The Japanese enterprises originally started some processing industries here," the mayor added, "and with this as a base, they have now moved to R.& D. and software development. . . . In the past one or two years, the software companies of the U.S. are also making some attempts to move outsourcing of software from the U.S. to our city."  Although some of what the mayor says gets lost in translation, he gets it — and we should, too: "The rule of the market economy is that if somewhere has the richest human resources and the cheapest labor, of course the enterprises and the businesses will naturally go there," he said.  Just as in manufacturing, he added, "Chinese people first were the employees and working for the big foreign manufacturers. And after several years, after we have learned all the processes and steps, we can start our own firms. Software will go down the same road. . . . First we will have our young people employed by the foreigners, and then we will start our own. It is like building a building. Today, the U.S., you are the designers, the architects, and the developing countries are the bricklayers for the buildings. But one day, I hope, we will be the architects."  The Chinese certainly want to believe it's inevitable that they will move from basic software outsourcing to design, but even a top Chinese science planner acknowledges that it won't be easy. Xu Kuangdi, president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said to me that for China to advance, "we have to build more products from our own intellectual property." But in software, he added, that will require "improving the innovative capability of the younger generation," which will require some big changes in China's rigid, rote education system. Chinese officials, he said, are thinking about such changes right now. I wouldn't bet against them.  Have your kids finished their homework?

						    urlLink Getting used to worse and worse   PART - II (continued from previous post "Talking themselves into a corner".   Getting used to worse and worse   ARUN SHOURIE    A document such as the Common Minimum Programme (CMP) is not what it is made out to be, ‘the Bible for Governance’. It is an excuse for getting together. The academics in government must have been a bit embarrassed by what Rohit Saran showed in India Today: proclamation after proclamation, to the very words in the CMP, have been lifted out of the corresponding document of the Deve Gowda government, that is of the government that the Congress brought down. In academia, this sort of a thing is called plagiarism. Of course, in politics, it is called continuity!   Unfortunately, the President’s Address does not mark much of an advance. Two-thirds of it is just the usual dhobi list. Read the sentences on channelling ‘‘a substantial portion of the government’s investment...to the villages, with special emphasis on improving basic infrastructure such as roads, power and drinking water in rural areas’’; on ‘‘connectivity of village complexes’’; on ensuring that ‘‘the flow of agricultural credit is significantly stepped up’’; on insurance schemes being extended to farmers; on agro-processing industries; on ‘‘fair and remunerative prices’’ to farmers; on standing up for national interests in WTO; on completing ‘‘ongoing irrigation projects’’, ‘‘in a time-bound manner’’; on harvesting rainwater and de-silting existing ponds; on ‘‘creating a climate conducive to investments in the organised sector’’; on creating new jobs and expanding credit to small-scale industry and services; on creating new jobs also in ‘‘village industries, textiles, handicrafts, horticulture, aquaculture, forestry, dairying, and agro-processing’’; on ‘‘modernising the railway network’’; on encouraging overseas investment in the hydrocarbon sector; on continuing reforms in the power sector, and giving energy conservation priority; on activising the National Development and inter-state councils; on making government agencies ‘‘responsive and accountable’’; to say nothing of what the address says on foreign policy—read the passages on any of these, and try and spot the difference.   Just read what the President’s Address has to say even on Ayodhya: ‘‘On Ayodhya issue, my government will await the verdict of the courts while encouraging negotiations between parties to the dispute for an amicable settlement which, in turn, must receive legal sanction.’’ How is this different from what was being pursued under Atalji’s government?   So, one is left to conclude either that drafting has run its course in India or that there is a consensus in practice and that documents such as these can be safely ignored. Where the CMP and the Address break new ground, they promise what every weak government does. ‘‘The Government will increase public spending on health to at least 2-3 per cent of GDP over the next five years...The Government will aim at increasing public spending on education so as to ultimately reach at least 6 per cent of GDP...’’   Those two promises alone will entail an outlay of Rs 1,90,000 crore every year—taking just the GDP of the current levels. With the growth of GDP they are determined to ensure, the outlay they are committing themselves to will be close to Rs 2,50,000 crore every year. Similarly, they have promised ‘‘guaranteed employment for 100 days in a year to at least one able-bodied person in each rural household’’. Swaminathan Aiyer’s multiplications put the resulting outlay in wages alone under this guarantee at Rs 1,90,000 crore. Further, he points out, assuming that the wage-component shall be half of the total cost of asset creation under the programme, this promise will entail an outlay of about Rs 3,80,000 crore.   Leave everything else aside, the cost of these three promises alone will be in the vicinity of Rs 6,30,000 crore every year. While there must be many imaginative ways of financing such inspirationally conceived programmes, to get a feel of what will be required, recall that the total tax and non-tax revenue of the Government of India is about Rs 3,30,000 crore! So, good-bye to all expenditures on defence, on salaries of government servants, on their pensions—and, of course, on packages for reviving and restructuring those ‘‘chronically loss-making’’ public sector units!   Perhaps someone saw the consequences of what was being promised, and therefore added a caveat in the President’s Address: ‘‘The Common Minimum Programme is indicative of the broad thrust of priorities of this Government. It will be the sincere effort of this Government to implement the Programme during the next five years. However, the precise content and phasing of programmes will depend on both the availability of resources and the pace of improvement of the absorptive capacity of various sectors.’’ And lo and behold! Many of our commentators lauded both—the imaginative promises as well as the realism!   These promises are a symptom. The more tenuous the ground of a government, the more populist its programmes. Everyone knows the havoc that the bankruptcy of Electricity Boards has inflicted on the power situation and therefore the progress of the country: unsustainable rates have led to wastage of power as well as excessive exploitation of groundwater, they have frightened away investment from the sector. But already there are declarations from the Left to dilute the reforms embodied in the Electricity Act—denied, how tentatively we do not know, by the Power Minister. Already governments such as that of Andhra have announced ‘‘free power to agriculture’’. And when they do so, why will other states lag in ‘‘serving the farmer’’? Hence, Tamil Nadu today, others tomorrow.   The equivocation notwithstanding, the talk of reservations in the private sector is of the same piece. Indeed, it is a promise that will have the most far-reaching consequences. Apologists whisper that it is just talk, all that has been promised is that a dialogue will be begun. But in such matters, as we saw so recently during the fires that V P Singh—at a moment of comparable tenuousness—ignited over the Mandal Commission report, once begun, these things are impossible to stop.   Many take heart from the contradictory statements that come out every other day. On interest rates for provident fund. On airport privatisation. On FDI in different sectors. On labour reforms. They see hope—‘‘The Government will fall because of its inner contradictions’’—the hope runs. Quite the contrary. Neither the Congress nor its props believe in anything. There is nothing because of which they will give up office—or, in the case of the Communists, the control over the ones in office. The consequences will follow from the opposite outcome: the Government will stay in office—by buying time through one populist lunge upon another.   There are two further sources from which harm of even greater import will swell. The first is that a government as precarious as this one will have no time to attend to the long-term problems that are weakening our country. Look at the way large swathes of the country—Bihar, the North-east, many others—are slipping into the abyss of non-governance. Today this is the greatest security threat to the country—if any reminder were needed, Nepal provides it.   If I were running the ISI, I would not waste lives in Kashmir. I would just smuggle five-ten thousand AK-47s via Bangladesh into Bihar. The people will do the rest. They will suck the BSF, CRPF and the rest into the bog of fratricidal violence. Will a government—and this has absolutely nothing to do with whether this is a UPA government or an NDA government—as precarious as this one, one that is as dependent as this one is on the very elements who have brought these regions to their present pass, be able to do anything to retrieve governance there?   Similarly, consider the inundation of the North-east by Bangladeshis. Intelligence chiefs, governors—not just of Assam but also of Bengal—home ministers from Indrajit Gupta to S B Chavan have acknowledged that between one and a half, two crore infiltrators from Bangladesh have spread through India. That among other things, they pose a grave security threat to the country. Even a Congress chief minister like Hiteswar Saikia acknowledged the peril they posed. Will a government constituted as the present one is, a government as precariously poised as this one is, do anything to staunch this inundation? Hiteswar Saikia’s admission—made on the floor of the state Assembly—provides a ready answer. He had but to acknowledge the fact and the leader of a communal outfit declared, ‘‘Unless he takes back his statement within 45 minutes, we will bring down his government.’’ And our friend took back his statement!   Similarly, a case against the suicidal IMDT Act has been rotting in the Supreme Court for years. The AGP government had owned up to the facts. The moment the Congress government came to office in Assam, it filed an ‘‘additional affidavit’’, and completely overturned what the state government had acknowledged. Ask any intelligence official, and you will learn what confidence and freedom ULFA has acquired since the last state elections. The case in the Supreme Court will come up one of these days, and you will see that this time the Central Government too will file an ‘‘additional affidavit’’.   Hence the danger: as we keep scoring points off each other, the cancer grows. An even graver threat comes from the compromises with norms that such situations force upon even the best of men. For those compromises weaken the state itself, and thus disable it even more from tackling the sorts of problems I mentioned. Look at the resignation with which Dr Manmohan Singh has to accept that his colleagues will look for decisions to the power outside government. Surely we will be told, ‘‘But there have been extra-constitutional centres of power before.’’   Look at the way a person like Dr Manmohan Singh has had to defend the inclusion of the sort of ministers he has had to accept. The defence itself speaks of the fatal drift. ‘‘But the NDA government too had chargesheeted ministers.’’ At the least that means that henceforth persons charged with any sort of crime can and will be inducted into even the Central Government. One step to the next, we get accustomed to worse and worse. Till 10 years ago no one could have imagined that such persons would be members of Parliament. With what has happened now, and at the hands of a man who has been a synonym for probity and rectitude, we will get used to their being in the Central Government.   Great trees are felled not so much by the single fierce storm as by the slow work of termites. Large countries are brought to their knees by the same, step-by-step erosion of norms. That is the process that this phase will accelerate.   — (Concluded)

						    urlLink Talking themselves into a corner   Talking themselves into a corner    ARUN SHOURIE      The Government is committed to a strong and effective public sector,’’ the new Government has said in the President’s address. No problem thus far—that is just a sort of mantra that is repeated in rituals. But the next half of the sentence breaks new ground—not with what the NDA government was doing, but with what constituents and props of the new Government have been saying thus far. The sentence continues, ‘‘whose social objectives are met by its commercial functioning’’. Now, that is certainly a novel thought! Thus far we were being told that the public sector units are not to function commercially because they are fulfilling ‘‘social objectives’’. That was the invariable answer when attention was drawn to the unconscionable losses that they were making. Now we are told that the ‘‘social objectives’’ are met by their functioning commercially!   Reality breaks in!   ‘‘But for this,’’ the address continues, ‘‘there is need for selectivity and a strategic focus.’’ A giveaway—that is the sort of sentence that is put in to find a way out of the one that has preceded it! The next sentence shows the strain even more. ‘‘My Government will devolve full managerial and commercial autonomy to successful, profit-making companies operating in a competitive environment.’’ As for devolving ‘‘full managerial and commercial autonomy’’, you have the long-running record of what the Congress as well as each of its allies and props have done over the decades to public sector units under their charge.   And you can see it today: every other day you get to read something about what is going to be done to prices of petroleum products; what do the repeated statements indicate about who is deciding the issue: the Ministry of Petroleum, or the petroleum enterprises?   Or is there an escape clause in the words of the address? Read them again: ‘‘My Government will devolve full managerial and commercial autonomy to successful, profit-making companies operating in a competitive environment.’’ Is the claim now that, while the petroleum companies are ‘‘successful’’ and ‘‘profit-making’’, they are not ‘‘operating in a competitive environment’’? Which they certainly are not—in the retail sector they still have monopoly positions!   The sentence that follows is one which the very persons who now proclaim it used to ridicule! ‘‘Privatisation will be considered on a case-by-case basis.’’ ‘‘Ah-ha! Case by case, is it?’’ the shout went. ‘‘Or suitcase by suitcase?’’ Of course, after Harshad Mehta’s admission, that taunt got to be used by all except the Congress. But, suddenly it is evidence of non-ideological, pragmatic thought!   The next sentence is the one which will hobble the new government the most, but first a word about the one that follows that one. ‘‘Private industry will be inducted to turn around companies that have potential for revival,’’ the Government has had the President say. How come this sudden reliance on private industry? Less than full faith in public sector managers? In the efficacy of that nostrum—of devolving ‘‘full managerial and commercial autonomy’’? Or does that medicine work only when the enterprises are already ‘‘successful, profit-making companies operating in a competitive environment’’?   But to return to the previous sentence. It reads: ‘‘Chronically loss-making companies will either be sold off, or closed, after workers get their legitimate dues and compensation.’’ The last clause in it, of course, is redundant. Under the law, no company, to say nothing of a government company, can be closed without the workers being paid their ‘‘legitimate dues and compensation’’. And as for companies that are being sold, the shareholders’ and share purchase agreements in each disinvestment provide that at all times the strategic buyer will have in place a compensation scheme for workers who may want to leave that would be at least as generous as the one that prevailed when the company was a government company. So, the words are gratuitous and redundant—they are just a ploy, like so many others, to make out as if something new is being done specially for workers when nothing is in fact being done.   But I am on the companies which the Government says it will either sell or close—the ones that are, to use its expression, ‘‘chronically loss-making’’. The first question is: ‘‘How many years of losses, and what magnitude of losses make a company ‘chronically loss-making’?’’ Let me list a few specific examples. Could colleagues in the media please find out from the Prime Minister or Finance Minister which of these they will either sell or close?    • Fertiliser Corporation of India: its accumulated losses as of March 31, 2002 (that is the latest date for which data is available in the public domain; all figures below refer to this date), are Rs 7,957 crore. It has been making losses continuously for 15 years. ‘‘Chronically’’ enough? Will it be sold or closed?   • Rashtriya Ispat Nigam: its accumulated losses are Rs 4,302 crore. It has been making losses continuously for five years—and that in spite of hefty packages to enable it to get out of the red, in 1993 and again in 1998. ‘‘Chronically’’ enough? Will it be sold or closed?   • National Jute Manufacturing Corporation: its accumulated losses are Rs 3,127 crore. It has been making losses continuously for 10 years. ‘‘Chronically’’ enough? Will it be sold or closed?   • Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals: its accumulated losses are Rs 1,926 crore. It has been making losses continuously since its inception in 1961, except for four years when it was made the canalising agency for imports of some drugs. ‘‘Chronically’’ enough? As a series of packages given between 1993 and 2002 failed to revive it, will it now be sold or closed?   • Hindustan Photo Films Manufacturing Corporation: its accumulated losses are Rs 1,829 crore. It has been making losses continuously for five years. ‘‘Chronically’’ enough? Will it be sold or closed?   • Cement Corporation of India: its accumulated losses are Rs 1,638 crore. It has been making losses continuously for four years. ‘‘Chronically’’ enough? Will it be sold or closed?   • Heavy Engineering Corporation: its accumulated losses are Rs 1,515 crore. It has been making losses continuously for seven years—in spite of packages to revive it given in 1972, 1975, 1981, 1989, 1997, and again 1999. ‘‘Chronically’’ enough? Will it be sold or closed?   • Mining and Allied Machinery Corporation: its accumulated losses are close to Rs 1,200 crore. And that in spite of several relief packages—in 1973, 1976, 1980, 1986 and subsequent years. ‘‘Chronically’’ enough? Will it be sold or closed?   • Hindustan Cables: its accumulated losses are Rs 867 crore. It has been making losses continuously for five years—in spite of a hefty relief package that was given in January 1999 in an attempt to keep it out of BIFR. ‘‘Chronically’’ enough? Will it be sold or closed?   • Hindustan Steel Works Construction Ltd: its accumulated losses are Rs 846 crore. It has been making losses continuously for four years—it registered a profit one year because of reliefs it was given. ‘‘Chronically’’ enough? Will it be sold or closed?   • Bharat Gold Mines: its accumulated losses are Rs 840 crore. It has been making losses continuously for five years. ‘‘Chronically’’ enough? Will it be sold or closed?   • Indian Iron and Steel Co: its accumulated losses are Rs 797 crore. It has been making losses continuously for five years. Schemes to revive it have followed schemes. To no avail. ‘‘Chronically’’ enough? Will it be sold or closed?   • Hindustan Copper: its accumulated losses are Rs 632 crore. It has been making losses continuously for five years. ‘‘Chronically’’ enough? Will it be sold or closed?   • Pyrites, Phosphates and Chemicals: its accumulated losses are Rs 468 crore. It has been making losses continuously for ten years. ‘‘Chronically’’ enough? Will it be sold or closed?   Before you conclude that these in any case are the sort of enterprises that fall within the convolutions of the Government and will therefore be closed or sold, do bear a few facts in mind:   • Hindustan Antibiotics has an accumulated loss of just Rs 174 crore—that is, it should be much less costly to sell or close than companies that have accumulated losses of thousands of crore. But Ram Vilas Paswan has already declared that it will not be sold or closed!   • If a Paswan can stop the Government on a mere Hindustan Antibiotics, what can the props of this government not make it do in regard to companies like Indian Iron and Steel?   • The core competence of companies like Hindustan Photo Films, I discovered, was the ‘‘goodwill’’ they are able to build up among influentials. No influential from Tamil Nadu will allow this derelict company, situated in Ooty as it is, to be either privatised or closed—accumulated losses or not, obsolete products and technologies or not.   • Let the Prime Minister or Finance Minister even suggest that Hindustan Cables will be sold or closed, and see the fusillade that the CPI leaders in Parliament will let loose.    The list can be doubled in no time. There is also the manifest fact. When a unit is ‘‘chronically loss-making’’, strategic partners will be loathe to invest in it: after strenuous efforts spread over one and half to two years in each instance, we had to return over a dozen cases to the Ministry of Heavy Industry as not even a single investor came forward. On other occasions, when a bidder did come forward for such an enterprise, his bid was so low that the Government had no option but to reject it.   NEPA was a classic case. What are pictured as ‘‘assets’’ in rhetoric—the township of NEPA, for instance—were, to the prospective partner, value-depleters: you want to produce paper, why take on running a derelict sewage and water system also? Government rejected the bid.   In the case of Jessop, a company that had been lying moribund in BIFR for years, in the face of court cases and all, the bid was accepted. The result? In NEPA, workers and officers from the unit came to tell me, even wages and salaries have not been paid for close to eight months now. On the other hand, within just months, Jessop has indeed turned around.   All this is well known to economists within the Government. But they will be able to do little: particular companies apart, and the ‘‘commitment’’ of individual leaders and props of the Government apart, there is the general fact. This government depends on the Left parties. Among the residual base of these parties are the unions in these enterprises. Who would be so rash as to expect the Prime Minister and Finance Minister to have the Communists ‘‘sacrifice’’ this base?   In a word, profit-making enterprises will not be privatised. And ‘‘chronically loss-making’’ ones cannot be privatised. The Ministry of Disinvestment is abolished. The Department of Disinvestment continues! Revolution accomplished.   And then there is ‘‘the dog that didn’t bark’’, that is words that are missing from the President’s address. The Common Minimum Programme had said, ‘‘All privatisations will be considered on a transparent and consultative case-by-case basis.’’ The President’s address says, ‘‘Privatisation will be considered on a case-by-case basis.’’ Not ‘‘transparent’’ we can understand! But not even ‘‘consultative’’? And that from a government so dependent on daily directives, to say nothing of ‘‘consultations’’? A bold deletion, I would say.   Another scrubbing out reveals even more. The CMP said, ‘‘While every effort will be made to modernise and restructure sick public sector companies and revive sick industry, chronically loss-making companies etc...’’ Surely that was a bold promise. For efforts to restructure and revive sick public sector units have a vivid history.    • The BIFR was created precisely to revive and restructure sick units—including sick public sector units. In spite of its efforts—in instances efforts spread over seven/eight years apiece—and in spite of very large concessions and write-offs, only a tenth of the units could be said to have been ‘‘revived’’ in any way.   • The most telling experience is from the most ardent champions of revival—the Communist government of West Bengal. They set up a department for industrial reconstruction and revival two decades ago. Over a score of companies were turned over to this department for revival. Do find out from them how many of these got revived over 20 years of what, we must assume, were the most dedicated, as well as the most expert efforts. And notice what the remedy is on which that very government has now alighted! The West Bengal government has decided to close down two enterprises completely, and to seek to revive 10—not by ‘‘disinvestment’’, heaven and Marx forbid; but by converting them into ‘‘joint ventures’’ through handing over up to 74 per cent equity to private partners!   The President’s address scrubs out the words I highlighted. There are no words pledging, ‘‘While every effort will be made to modernise and restructure sick public sector companies and revive sick industry...’’. The sentence begins with, ‘‘Chronically loss-making companies will either be sold off or closed....’’ What should one make of this scrubbing out? That reality is breaking in? Or that ‘‘solemn commitments’’ made just weeks ago in that ‘Bible of Governance’, the CMP, are already being broken? That reformers in Government have triumphed? Or that the props have caved in to bourgeois compulsions?   And yet the convolutions over privatisation are just a symptom.   (To be continued)

						    urlLink The New York Times > Opinion > Op-Ed Columnist: Love Our Technology, Love Us   Love Our Technology, Love Us By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN  Published: June 20, 2004 BEIJING  If anti-Americanism is on the rise around the world, no one told the kids in the student visa line at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. The quest among Chinese students for visas to study in America, say U.S. Embassy officials, has become so intense that it has spawned Internet chat rooms, where Chinese students swap stories about which arguments work best with which U.S. consular officials and even give them names like "Amazon Goddess," "Too Tall Baldy" and "Handsome Guy."  Just how closely Chinese students strategize over the Internet on how to get visas to America — at a time when fewer are being given for security reasons — was revealed to the embassy recently when on one day one consular officer had scores of students come through with the same line, which some chat room had suggested would work: "I want to go to America to become a famous professor." After hearing this all day, he was surprised to get one student who came before him and pronounced, "My mom has an artificial limb and I want to build a better artificial leg for my mom and that is why I want to study in the U.S." The consular officer was so relieved to hear a new line that he told the young man: "You know, this is the best story I've heard this morning. I really salute you. I'm going to give you a visa."  You guessed it. The next day every other student who showed up at the embassy said he or she wanted to go to America to learn how to build "a better artificial limb for my mother." Said one U.S. official: "We have to be so careful what we say, because it gets into the chat rooms right away."   Hearing stories like this, you have to wonder: are Bush officials right when they dismiss all of this talk that President Bush has made America more unpopular in the world now than at any other time in postwar history? Do people really hate us? Don't those visa lines say otherwise? This is worth a closer look.  To begin with, there a few "technical" reasons why anti-Americanism generally does not have the same edge in Asia as in Europe and the Middle East. Asia's leaders, as a group, have much more legitimacy than leaders in the Arab world, either because they have come to power through free elections or because they have delivered on their core promise to their people of economic growth. Because of that, they don't need to demonize America regularly to deflect their people's anger from them. Also, Asia generally is focused like a laser on economic development — and countries like China see investment and technology transfer from America as critical to their growth. "People in Asia do not hate the United States," Singapore's elder statesman, Lee Kuan Yew, said to me. "Big countries like China and India are focused right now on their economic development and they see in America an enormous well to draw technology and economic growth from."  But here's the problem: Young people want American education and technology more than ever, but fewer and fewer want to wear our T-shirts anymore — want to be identified as "pro-American." As one former U.S. diplomat in Beijing put it to me: "They want to cherry-pick us, not line up with us. We've lost prestige."  The idea of America as the embodiment of the promise of freedom and democracy — not just of technology and high living standards — is integral to how we think of ourselves, but it is no longer how a lot of others think of us. They are now compartmentalizing. The unilateral war in Iraq, the postwar mess there, the walk-away from Kyoto and other treaties, the Abu Ghraib scandal have taken a toll. The idea of America as embodying the charisma of democracy has been damaged. As the political theorist Yaron Ezrahi put it, "America as the do-gooder has been hurt, but America as the goods-doer is still there."  Fortunately, this situation is not irreparable. The longing for an America that exports hope, not fear, and that is an example of the best global practices and values, runs really deep in the world. In fact, it is one reason that some people abroad are so angry with President Bush — because they blame him for taking that America away from them. I'm convinced a different approach or different administration would elicit a big response from the world. But for now, we will pay a price, because when people want to line up for our visas but not for our policies, it means Americans alone will have to bear the burden and the price of those policies.  That is not good for us. When you lose your status as a power with values, you weaken your ability to fight those powers without values.

						    urlLink The New York Times > Opinion > Op-Ed Columnist: Maids vs. Occupiers   Maids vs. Occupiers By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN  Published: June 17, 2004 BEIJING  Visiting India and now China in the past few months tells me how much we Americans need to finish our business in Iraq and lower our profile there — not so we can wash our hands of the idea, and necessity, of promoting reform in the Arab world, but so we can advance that effort.  We can't dictate reform to the Arabs. Look at how even a watered-down reform proposal from the G-8 summit meeting — the Broader Middle East Initiative — was received in the Arab-Muslim world. No one paid any attention to it. The whole concept was dead on arrival because it was made in America, which is now radioactive in the Arab world.  The pressure for change has to come from within, and I think it can — if we lower our profile. Then the Arab world will have to look clearly at the fact that China, India, Sri Lanka and the Philippines — all the countries that provide maid service for the Saudi and other Arab ruling elites and manual labor for their construction — have leapt so far ahead with their own development that they are now taking good jobs away from America.   To put it another way, there are two ways for the U.S. to promote reform in the Arab world — where there is an ocean of untapped brainpower, particularly among women. One way is to try to dictate it, which is not working. American policy has become so unpopular in the Arab world that anti-reformers can easily delegitimize the reform process by labeling it a "U.S. plot to destroy Islam," and reformers are silenced because they don't want to be seen as promoting a made-in-America agenda.   The other way for us to promote reform is to get out of the way so people in the Middle East can see clearly that many of their maids' children — from India, China, Sri Lanka and the Philippines — are excelling at math, science and engineering, leaving Arab children, not to mention many American children, in the dust. (Over one million Indians work in Saudi Arabia alone.)  Only when the Arabs focus on how their maids' children are doing in the world, not what the Americans are doing in their region, will they revisit one of the most famous sayings of the Prophet Muhammad: "Seek knowledge, even unto China. That is the duty for every Muslim."  I hadn't been to China since 2001, and one of the first new things I noticed here was the number of women selling phone cards for cellphone minutes. While Islamist terrorists in Iraq and Saudi Arabia are using cellphone technology and cars to create bombs, China and India are making themselves the world's new-car manufacturing centers and are inventing new profit-making uses for Internet-enabled cellphones — none of which involve blowing anything or anyone up.   An Arab journalist friend living in London told me that there is today — sadly — an all too pervasive sense in too many quarters of the Arab world of a once-great civilization having been left behind, not unlike Weimar Germany. Because Germany was already a modern state, it created a massive military response to its humiliation: the Third Reich. "The Arabs can't," he said. "So they create bin Ladenism instead, which can't build a state, only demolish one."  So how does one get a healthy reform debate started? "You need a courageous intelligentsia," he said. "You can't have that as long as people feel besieged. The new historians in Israel only emerged during Oslo. When you feel besieged, you will never start a debate with your brother and sister. Now it is the battle against the enemy, be it real or imaginary."  All the more reason why we — the perceived enemy — need to hand over power to an elected Iraqi government, and move our troops into the background. If we can do that, I would suggest that next year the G-8 invite both India and China to join, and hold the next G-10 summit either at one of the manicured campuses of Indian outsourcing companies or in Shanghai's manufacturing hub. Then invite Arab leaders to attend. India and China were once seen as their equals.  Real change happens when people see something in those they compare themselves to, and draw their own conclusions — not when it's imposed on them. Our job was to smash Iraq's old order and lay the foundations for a new one. Now we need to lower our profile so people in that Arab-Muslim world can see clearly something we've been obstructing and they've been deliberately ignoring: that the world today wants to invest more in their maids' children than in their own children. Once that reality sinks in, so, too, will reform.

						    urlLink The New York Times > Opinion > Op-Ed Columnist: D-Day in Iraq   D-Day in Iraq By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN  Published: June 10, 2004  There's been some good political news out of Iraq in recent days. The newly installed — and now U.N.-blessed — Iraqi government is made up of some really decent people. There is hope. But it will not be realized if the sort of incident that happened last weekend keeps being repeated. Two American and two Polish employees of Blackwater USA, a security contractor, were killed in an ambush on the main road from Baghdad airport to downtown Baghdad. Remember a year ago when Saddam's spokesman, the wacky "Baghdad Bob," claimed that U.S. forces didn't control the airport? We shouldn't have laughed. A year later, we still do not fully control the main road from Baghdad airport to Baghdad. You can't build anything under those conditions.   It is hard to know whether to laugh or cry when you hear President Bush comparing D-Day to the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the war on terrorism. If President Franklin Roosevelt had thrown the meager manpower resources into D-Day that George Bush threw into Iraq a year ago, France would be a German-speaking country today.   Alas, it is too late now to send a lot more U.S. troops, if we had them. Now that the interim Iraqi government is assuming sovereignty, it will be increasingly important for U.S. forces to assume a lower profile, to get out of the faces of Iraqis at checkpoints and eliminate any impression that Iraq is still under U.S. occupation or that the new Iraqi government is our puppet. The whole strategy of the bad guys in Iraq now is to wreak havoc and try to provoke a U.S. military reaction that might accidentally kill a lot of Iraqis — in the hope that this will embarrass and delegitimize the new Iraqi officials as ineffective U.S. flunkies.  We are up against some really evil, cynical forces: die-hard Baathists, Qaeda-inspired Islamists and criminals. They continue to kill large numbers of innocent Iraqis without ever spelling out a political demand. That's because their only interest is that America fail. They have no coherent vision for Iraq. Their only vision is that America must fail. Because if the U.S. succeeds in tilting Iraq onto a more progressive track, Baathism and Islamism will be diminished everywhere.  There is nothing more difficult to fight than an enemy whose only interest is that you fail and who has no interest in building a positive alternative. That kind of enemy can only be overwhelmed and crushed. But the D-Day solution for Iraq is not for America to throw all its troops into Iraq. As I said, it's too late for that. It is for America to throw all its resources into getting Iraqi soldiers trained and able to take on their own opposition. Only Iraqis will find out who their bad guys are and have the legitimacy to defeat them. As the Stanford University democracy specialist Larry Diamond, a former U.S. adviser in Baghdad, put it: "If you don't have security in Iraq, you don't have anything. We have to throw everything we have — everything — into getting the new Iraqi forces operating effectively."  How close are we to that? I called Lt. Gen. David Petraeus in Baghdad, the widely respected U.S. commander for rebuilding the Iraqi Army. He told me that contracts for more than $3 billion worth of equipment, uniforms, training facilities, weaponry, bases and communications gear for the new Iraqi Army are finally being signed and executed — so by the end of the summer, a lot of it should be getting to units. Moreover, he said, the first battalion of Iraqi internal security forces, trained for urban warfare, will be deployed in Baghdad. If the training stays on schedule, says General Petraeus, a critical mass of trained Iraqi Army, civil defense and police forces should be up and running by January, in time for elections.  "Early on, just after we got here, we talked a lot about how to win Iraqi hearts and minds, and get them to like us," General Petraeus said. "But we understand now that what we really need is for them to love the new Iraq. That is what needs to happen. . . . Bombs are going to go off every day, but what we need to do is somehow keep looking to the longer term and focus on building the new Iraq. . . . We just need to keep our heads down, be patient and keep driving on. This is really, really hard work."  That's what this D-Day looks like. It is not a single charge up a Normandy beach, but a long, hard slog to train an Iraqi Army to finish the war that we started. This is the Iraqis' real war of independence. If they beat back the bad guys and hold elections, they'll be free of us and the worst of their past. If they don't or can't, this will be our Waterloo, and theirs.

						   Taz (or Dr.Taz as I prefer to call him) is one of my best friends and a brilliant final year medical student. The short article below is written by him in an attempt to tickle our thoughts on life and cosnciousness and is not intended by the author to provoke any person who beleievs in divinity.  Reem       On the nature of Consciousness   Taz Hameer   The nature of consciousness has always intrigued the thinking human. Various religions of the worlds and schools of thought have speculated on the nature of consciousness, in particular, human consciousness. On par with the nature of human consciousness, the idea of a Supreme Consciousness(es) as a supposedly existing Creator(s) has also intrigued the human species.  I do not wish to speculate on nature of the Divinity(ies) since  personally I believe, with all respects to the believers of the various faiths (I really mean that. No sarcasms intended), that s/he/they are  non existing entity(ies) and a primitive fabrication of the human race in a humbling attempt to explain the reason for their existence and find some comfort and hope in a world and universe that is void of good and evil, right and wrong, one without morality, one that is indifferent.  However I would like, not to speculate but to explain atleast to some degree, the nature of human and animal consciousness based on the findings of Science which I think is very obvious.  I would like to address the claim that consciousness is eternal and continues after death. This is one of the basic teachings of the various religions of the east and the west.  I believe that science shows us that the above is not true.  Consciousness is not eternal and ceases to exist after death. To justify this, I will define my understanding of consciousness.  I consider consciousness synonymous with awareness of one's  surroundings. Nothing more. Awareness of one's surroundings in humans is possible only through the following pathways:  * Visual * Auditory * Olfactory * Tactile * Taste  Now, damage to the visual pathway whether in the intraocular structures or on the retina, the optic nerve, optic chiasma, optic tract, lateral geniculate body, optic radiations, or broca's areas 17,18 and 19 of the occipital cortex, will result, depending on the extent and the site of damage, in to either partial or complete unilateral or bilateral blindess. If blindess is complete in both the eyes, then, the visual aspect of awareness will cease to exist.  The same for the hearing pathway. If fully damaged, the result is  either conductive deafness or sensorineural deafness or both depending on the nature of the cause and the site of damage. And the auditory aspect of awareness ceases to exist.  This axiom, if I may call it, applies to the remaining aspects of  awareness:  the olfactory, tactile and taste pathways. Destroy each of these pathways and the respective aspects of awareness ceases to exist. Destroy all of them and awareness (consciousness) no longer exists. You no longer exist.  I think thats what happens after death. The existence of consciousness depends on the anatomicaland physiological functioning of the human or animal body. After all, we are nothing more than automata.  This realization makes most of us uncomfortable since it goes against our beliefs and consequently we reject it. Those of us brave enough to accept it are initially saddened since instinctively like most of the animal kingdom, we want to survive and live. I would not be surprised if that was one of the reasons, if not the prime one, for our species inventing of god(s) and life after death.  " What? Is Man merely a mistake of God's? Or God merely a mistake of  man's?"   - Nietzsche   Knowing we will one day be "turned off" forever is scary initially. But after sometime, we realize its nobig deal. We learn to appreciate life more and value its preciousness.  We learn to make the best of our lives and try to help others do the same.

						    urlLink The New York Times > Opinion > Op-Ed Columnist: Think Global, Act Local   Think Global, Act Local By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN  Published: June 6, 2004  The Wall Street Journal had a front-page story last Wednesday that caught my eye. It was about how the antiglobalization movement seemed to be losing steam, with police not expecting the sort of violent protesters of the late 1990's to show up at the G-8 summit in Sea Island, Ga., this week. If you want to understand why the antiglobalization movement — which was always a mishmash of groups and ideologies — has lost its edge, you should study the recent Indian elections. And if the antiglobalizers want to understand how they could again become relevant, they should study those elections as well.  To everyone's surprise, India's elections ended with the rightist Hindu nationalist B.J.P. alliance being thrown out and replaced by the left-leaning Congress Party alliance. Of course, no sooner did the B.J.P. — which ran on a platform of taking credit for India's high-tech revolution — go down than the usual suspects from the antiglobalization movement declared this was a grass-roots rejection of India's globalization strategy. They got it exactly wrong. What Indian voters were saying was not: "Stop the globalization train, we want to get off." It was, "Slow down the globalization train, and build me a better step-stool, because I want to get on."  "Every time an Indian villager watches the community TV and sees an ad for soap or shampoo, what they notice are not the soap and shampoo but the lifestyle of the people using them, the kind of motorbikes they ride, their dress and their homes," says Nayan Chanda, the Indian-born editor of the invaluable YaleGlobal online magazine. "They see a world they want access to. This election was about envy, anger and aspirations. It was a classic case of revolutions happening when things are getting better but not fast enough for many people."   Indeed, Indian villagers and farmers are just like all other consumers today — better informed. And they seemed to know, at a gut level, exactly why the B.J.P.'s stress on information technology was not delivering for them. It was because local governments in India have become so eaten away by corruption and mismanagement they cannot deliver for the poor the schools and infrastructure they need to get a fair share of the pie. The Indian masses didn't vote for an antiglobalization strategy, they voted for (among other things) an effective globalization strategy. Sonia Gandhi, the Congress Party leader, seemed to understand this when she chose as prime minister Manmohan Singh, the former Congress finance minister, who first put the Indian economy onto a globalization track in the 1990's. His task now is to make globalization work for more Indians by making government work for more Indians.  "Both the Congress and its left allies would be risking India's future if they draw the wrong conclusion from this election," said Pratap Bhanu Mehta, an Indian professor of government, writing in The Hindu. "The revolt against holders of power is not a revolt of the poor against the rich: ordinary people are far less prone to resent other people's success, than intellectuals suppose. It is rather an expression of the fact that the reform of the state has not gone far enough." Gurcharan Das, the former head of Procter & Gamble in India, wrote in The Times of India that this election was about better local governance: "What matters to the rickshawala [scooter driver] is that the cops not take away a sixth of his daily earnings. The farmer wants a clear title to his land without having to bribe the patwari [village accountant]. The sick villager wants the doctor to be there when she visits the primary health center. The housewife doesn't want the water tap to go dry while she is washing."  My own recent travels to India have left me convinced that the most important forces combating poverty there today are those activists who are fighting for better local governance. The world doesn't need the antiglobalization movement to go away now — it just needs for the movement to grow up. It had a lot of energy and a lot of mobilizing capacity. What it lacked was a real agenda for helping the poor. Here's what its agenda should be: Helping the poor by improving governance — accountability, transparency, education and the rule of law — at the local level, by using the Internet and other tools to spotlight corruption, mismanagement and tax avoidance. It may not be as sexy as protesting against world leaders on CNN, but it is a lot more important. Ask any Indian villager.

						    urlLink The New York Times > Opinion > Op-Ed Columnist: The ABC's of Hatred   The ABC's of Hatred By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN  Published: June 3, 2004  Surely the most chilling aspect of the latest terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia against foreigners at the Khobar oil center was in reports from the scene about how the Saudi militants tried to kill or capture only the non-Muslims, and let Muslims and Arabs go. The Associated Press quoted a Lebanese woman, Orora Naoufal, who was taken hostage in her apartment, as saying that the gunmen released her when they learned of her nationality. They told her they were interested in harming only "infidels" and Westerners.  Now where would the terrorists have learned such intolerance and discrimination? Answer: in the Saudi public school system and religious curriculum.  That is the only conclusion one can draw, not only from listening to what the terrorists said, but, more important, from listening to what some courageous Saudi liberals — and yes, there are many progressive Saudis who want their country to become more open and tolerant — are saying in their own press.  The Saudi English-language daily, Arab News, recently published a series by the liberal Saudi writer Raid Qusti about the need to re-evaluate Saudi education. Mr. Qusti quotes the editor of Al Riyadh newspaper as saying the people carrying out this latest rash of attacks inside Saudi Arabia have the same ideology as the Saudi extremists who seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca in 1979. They had an ideology of accusing all others as being "infidels," thereby giving themselves a license to kill them.  "If we as a nation decline to look at the root causes, as we have for the past two decades, it will only be a matter of time before another group of people with the same ideology springs up," noted Mr. Qusti. "Have we helped create these monsters? Our education system, which does not stress tolerance of other faiths — let alone tolerance of followers of other Islamic schools of thought — is one thing that needs to be re-evaluated from top to bottom. Saudi culture itself and the fact the majority of us do not accept other lifestyles and impose our own on other people is another. And the fact that from the fourth to the 12th grade, we do not teach our children that there are other civilizations in the world and that we are part of the global community, and only stress the Islamic empires over and over, is also worth re-evaluating. And last but certainly not least, the religious climate in the country must change." (Memri translation.)  Over the last year or so, Hamza Qablan al-Mozainy, an Arabic professor at King Saud University, published two articles in the Saudi daily Al Watan about "the culture of death in our schools" and the role that Saudi teachers are playing in promoting discussions on how bodies are prepared for burial and how the kind of life a person has led — righteous or decadent — can be read from the condition of the person's dead body. This effort to use death to get young people to abstain from the attractions of life, he said, only ends up making some Saudi youth easy targets for extremists trying to recruit young people for "jihad" operations. "Does the Education Ministry really know about the activities taking place in its schools?" Mr. al-Mozainy asked.  As the saying goes, "Denial is not just a river in Egypt" — and Saudi leaders have been in denial for too long. They need to wake up — and we need an energy policy that reduces our dependence on Saudi oil. I don't want the difference between a good day and bad day to be whether Saudi Arabia reforms its education system.  A few years ago, Vice President Dick Cheney dismissed those of us who advocate energy conservation as dreamy do-gooders. Had he spent the last three years using his bully pulpit to push for conservation and alternative energies, rather than dismissing them, we'd be a lot less dependent today on foreign oil. Oh, that is so naïve, says the oil crowd. Well, what would you call a Bush energy policy that keeps America dependent on a medieval monarchy with a king who has lost most of his faculties, where there is virtually no transparency about what's happening, where corruption is rampant, where we have asked all Americans to leave and where the education system is so narrow that its own people are decrying it as a factory for extremism? Now that's what I'd call naïve. I'd also call it reckless and dangerous.

						   The Truth and Beauty of Darwinism By Murtaza Hameer   "When I view all beings not as special creations, but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Cambrian [geological] system was deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled."   CHARLES DARWIN The Origin of Species, Chapter XV  Darwinian evolution is still called a "theory" when in reality it is not a theory but a fact. Darwinian evolution is a fact because it is supported by fossil and molecular evidences enough to show that it is happening.  A simple example is that of the fossils of Sahelanthropus (as old as 7 million years) gradually branching off in to Orrorin, and then to Ardipithecus ---> Australopithecus anamensis ---> Australopithecus  afarensis ---> Homo habilis ---> Homo erectus ---> Homo sapiens (Thats us!). These are objective fossil findings and yet sadly Darwinian evolution is a labelled a "theory", even in standard biology textbooks!  Even better than fossil evidences are molecular evidences. Almost all of life is made of the same stuff: DNA (or else RNA) written in the code of the bases A T C G. DNA studies have shown that our DNA and the DNA of chimpanzees is 99.6 percent same! We are closer cousins with the chimpanzees than the latter are to the gibbons, siamangs, orangutans, and other apes!  There is simply no way of explaining the above amazing findings other than by the concept of Darwinian evolution. Therefore, evolution cannot be a theory. It is a fact and rightly so. It is time to stop calling Darwinian evolution a theory. Its a fact just as gravity is a fact.  Even just anatomy, physiology and behaviour studies of chimpanzees have shown how exacly like us they are. The differences are not of kind but only of degree which is what evolution is all about.  It is no wonder that when Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace put forth natural selection, T.H. Huxley replied, "How stupid of me not think of that!" and the wife of the Bishop of Worcester said "Descended from the apes! My dear, let us hope that it is not true, but if it is, let us pray that it will not become generally known" since it was so obvious; and I don't blame Richard Dawkins when he said , "Only a fool will deny Darwinism" because it is just so damn obvious and supported by evidence.  No other philosophy, school of thought, or religion explains how life came about. They do not even make a successful attempt. Its either stories from scriptures which have to be taken on faith and/or we are told of "God" being the creator which offers no explanation at all. It only satisfies our emotions. Our need to create a God to explain life is our human weakness of anthropocentrism that makes us want there to be a God. An opiate of the masses!

						     The Improbability of God      by Richard Dawkins          The following article is from  urlLink  Free Inquiry  magazine , Volume 18, Number 3.      Much of what people do is done in the name of God. Irishmen blow each other up in his name. Arabs blow themselves up in his name. Imams and ayatollahs oppress women in his name. Celibate popes and priests mess up people's sex lives in his name. Jewish  shohets  cut live animals' throats in his name. The achievements of religion in past history - bloody crusades, torturing inquisitions, mass-murdering conquistadors, culture-destroying missionaries, legally enforced resistance to each new piece of scientific truth until the last possible moment - are even more impressive. And what has it all been in aid of? I believe it is becoming increasingly clear that the answer is absolutely nothing at all. There is no reason for believing that any sort of gods exist and quite good reason for believing that they do not exist and never have. It has all been a gigantic waste of time and a waste of life. It would be a joke of cosmic proportions if it weren't so tragic.      Why do people believe in God? For most people the answer is still some version of the ancient Argument from Design. We look about us at the beauty and intricacy of the world - at the aerodynamic sweep of a swallow's wing, at the delicacy of flowers and of the butterflies that fertilize them, through a microscope at the teeming life in every drop of pond water, through a telescope at the crown of a giant redwood tree. We reflect on the electronic complexity and optical perfection of our own eyes that do the looking. If we have any imagination, these things drive us to a sense of awe and reverence. Moreover, we cannot fail to be struck by the obvious resemblance of living organs to the carefully planned designs of human engineers. The argument was most famously expressed in the watchmaker analogy of the eighteenth-century priest William Paley. Even if you didn't know what a watch was, the obviously designed character of its cogs and springs and of how they mesh together for a purpose would force you to conclude "that the watch must have had a maker: that there must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed it for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction, and designed its use." If this is true of a comparatively simple watch, how much the more so is it true of the eye, ear, kidney, elbow joint, brain? These beautiful, complex, intricate, and obviously purpose-built structures must have had their own designer, their own watchmaker - God.      So ran Paley's argument, and it is an argument that nearly all thoughtful and sensitive people discover for themselves at some stage in their childhood. Throughout most of history it must have seemed utterly convincing, self-evidently true. And yet, as the result of one of the most astonishing intellectual revolutions in history, we now know that it is wrong, or at least superfluous. We now know that the order and apparent purposefulness of the living world has come about through an entirely different process, a process that works without the need for any designer and one that is a consequence of basically very simple laws of physics. This is the process of evolution by natural selection, discovered by Charles Darwin and, independently, by Alfred Russel Wallace.      What do all objects that look as if they must have had a designer have in common? The answer is statistical improbability. If we find a transparent pebble washed into the shape of a crude lens by the sea, we do not conclude that it must have been designed by an optician: the unaided laws of physics are capable of achieving this result; it is not too improbable to have just "happened." But if we find an elaborate compound lens, carefully corrected against spherical and chromatic aberration, coated against glare, and with "Carl Zeiss" engraved on the rim, we know that it could not have just happened by chance. If you take all the atoms of such a compound lens and throw them together at random under the jostling influence of the ordinary laws of physics in nature, it is  theoretically  possible that, by sheer luck, the atoms would just happen to fall into the pattern of a Zeiss compound lens, and even that the atoms round the rim should happen to fall in such a way that the name Carl Zeiss is etched out. But the number of other ways in which the atoms could, with equal likelihood, have fallen, is so hugely, vastly, immeasurably greater that we can completely discount the chance hypothesis. Chance is out of the question as an explanation.      This is not a circular argument, by the way. It might seem to be circular because, it could be said,  any  particular arrangement of atoms is, with hindsight, very improbable. As has been said before, when a ball lands on a particular blade of grass on the golf course, it would be foolish to exclaim: "Out of all the billions of blades of grass that it  could  have fallen on, the ball actually fell on this one. How amazingly, miraculously improbable!" The fallacy here, of course, is that the ball had to land somewhere. We can only stand amazed at the improbability of the actual event if we specify it  a priori : for example, if a blindfolded man spins himself round on the tee, hits the ball at random, and achieves a hole in one. That would be truly amazing, because the target destination of the ball is specified in advance.      Of all the trillions of different ways of putting together the atoms of a telescope, only a minority would actually work in some useful way. Only a tiny minority would have Carl Zeiss engraved on them, or, indeed,  any  recognizable words of any human language. The same goes for the parts of a watch: of all the billions of possible ways of putting them together, only a tiny minority will tell the time or do anything useful. And of course the same goes,  a fortiori , for the parts of a living body. Of all the trillions of trillions of ways of putting together the parts of a body, only an infinitesimal minority would live, seek food, eat, and reproduce. True, there are many different ways of being alive - at least ten million different ways if we count the number of distinct species alive today - but, however many ways there may be of being alive, it is certain that there are vastly more ways of being dead!      We can safely conclude that living bodies are billions of times too complicated - too statistically improbable - to have come into being by sheer chance. How, then, did they come into being? The answer is that chance enters into the story, but not a single, monolithic act of chance. Instead, a whole series of tiny chance steps, each one small enough to be a believable product of its predecessor, occurred one after the other in sequence. These small steps of chance are caused by genetic mutations, random changes - mistakes really - in the genetic material. They give rise to changes in the existing bodily structure. Most of these changes are deleterious and lead to death. A minority of them turn out to be slight improvements, leading to increased survival and reproduction. By this process of natural selection, those random changes that turn out to be beneficial eventually spread through the species and become the norm. The stage is now set for the next small change in the evolutionary process. After, say, a thousand of these small changes in series, each change providing the basis for the next, the end result has become, by a process of accumulation, far too complex to have come about in a single act of chance.      For instance, it is theoretically possible for an eye to spring into being, in a single lucky step, from nothing: from bare skin, let's say. It is theoretically possible in the sense that a recipe could be written out in the form of a large number of mutations. If all these mutations happened simultaneously, a complete eye could, indeed, spring from nothing. But although it is theoretically possible, it is in practice inconceivable. The quantity of luck involved is much too large. The "correct" recipe involves changes in a huge number of genes simultaneously. The correct recipe is one particular combination of changes out of trillions of equally probable combinations of chances. We can certainly rule out such a miraculous coincidence. But it  is  perfectly plausible that the modern eye could have sprung from something almost the same as the modern eye but not quite: a very slightly less elaborate eye. By the same argument, this slightly less elaborate eye sprang from a slightly less elaborate eye still, and so on. If you assume a  sufficiently large number of sufficiently small differences  between each evolutionary stage and its predecessor, you are bound to be able to derive a full, complex, working eye from bare skin. How many intermediate stages are we allowed to postulate? That depends on how much time we have to play with. Has there been enough time for eyes to evolve by little steps from nothing?      The fossils tell us that life has been evolving on Earth for more than 3,000 million years. It is almost impossible for the human mind to grasp such an immensity of time. We, naturally and mercifully, tend to see our own expected lifetime as a fairly long time, but we can't expect to live even one century. It is 2,000 years since Jesus lived, a time span long enough to blur the distinction between history and myth. Can you imagine a million such periods laid end to end? Suppose we wanted to write the whole history on a single long scroll. If we crammed all of Common Era history into one metre of scroll, how long would the pre-Common Era part of the scroll, back to the start of evolution, be? The answer is that the pre-Common Era part of the scroll would stretch from Milan to Moscow. Think of the implications of this for the quantity of evolutionary change that can be accommodated. All the domestic breeds of dogs - Pekingeses, poodles, spaniels, Saint Bernards, and Chihuahuas - have come from wolves in a time span measured in hundreds or at the most thousands of years: no more than two meters along the road from Milan to Moscow. Think of the quantity of change involved in going from a wolf to a Pekingese; now multiply that quantity of change by a million. When you look at it like that, it becomes easy to believe that an eye could have evolved from no eye by small degrees.      It remains necessary to satisfy ourselves that every one of the intermediates on the evolutionary route, say from bare skin to a modern eye, would have been favored by natural selection; would have been an improvement over its predecessor in the sequence or at least would have survived. It is no good proving to ourselves that there is theoretically a chain of almost perceptibly different intermediates leading to an eye if many of those intermediates would have died. It is sometimes argued that the parts of an eye have to be all there together or the eye won't work at all. Half an eye, the argument runs, is no better than no eye at all. You can't fly with half a wing; you can't hear with half an ear. Therefore there can't have been a series of step-by-step intermediates leading up to a modern eye, wing, or ear.      This type of argument is so naive that one can only wonder at the subconscious motives for wanting to believe it. It is obviously not true that half an eye is useless. Cataract sufferers who have had their lenses surgically removed cannot see very well without glasses, but they are still much better off than people with no eyes at all. Without a lens you can't focus a detailed image, but you can avoid bumping into obstacles and you could detect the looming shadow of a predator.      As for the argument that you can't fly with only half a wing, it is disproved by large numbers of very successful gliding animals, including mammals of many different kinds, lizards, frogs, snakes, and squids. Many different kinds of tree-dwelling animals have flaps of skin between their joints that really are fractional wings. If you fall out of a tree, any skin flap or flattening of the body that increases your surface area can save your life. And, however small or large your flaps may be, there must always be a critical height such that, if you fall from a tree of that height, your life would have been saved by just a little bit more surface area. Then, when your descendants have evolved that extra surface area, their lives would be saved by just a bit more still if they fell from trees of a slightly greater height. And so on by insensibly graded steps until, hundreds of generations later, we arrive at full wings.      Eyes and wings cannot spring into existence in a single step. That would be like having the almost infinite luck to hit upon the combination number that opens a large bank vault. But if you spun the dials of the lock at random, and every time you got a little bit closer to the lucky number the vault door creaked open another chink, you would soon have the door open! Essentially, that is the secret of how evolution by natural selection achieves what once seemed impossible. Things that cannot plausibly be derived from very different predecessors  can  plausibly be derived from only slightly different predecessors. Provided only that there is a sufficiently long series of such slightly different predecessors, you can derive anything from anything else.      Evolution, then, is theoretically  capable  of doing the job that, once upon a time, seemed to be the prerogative of God. But is there any evidence that evolution actually has happened? The answer is yes; the evidence is overwhelming. Millions of fossils are found in exactly the places and at exactly the depths that we should expect if evolution had happened. Not a single fossil has ever been found in any place where the evolution theory would not have expected it, although this  could  very easily have happened: a fossil mammal in rocks so old that fishes have not yet arrived, for instance, would be enough to disprove the evolution theory.      The patterns of distribution of living animals and plants on the continents and islands of the world is exactly what would be expected if they had evolved from common ancestors by slow, gradual degrees. The patterns of resemblance among animals and plants is exactly what we should expect if some were close cousins, and others more distant cousins to each other. The fact that the genetic code is the same in all living creatures overwhelmingly suggests that all are descended from one single ancestor. The evidence for evolution is so compelling that the only way to save the creation theory is to assume that God deliberately planted enormous quantities of evidence to make it  look  as if evolution had happened. In other words, the fossils, the geographical distribution of animals, and so on, are all one gigantic confidence trick. Does anybody want to worship a God capable of such trickery? It is surely far more reverent, as well as more scientifically sensible, to take the evidence at face value. All living creatures are cousins of one another, descended from one remote ancestor that lived more than 3,000 million years ago.      The Argument from Design, then, has been destroyed as a reason for believing in a God. Are there any other arguments? Some people believe in God because of what appears to them to be an inner revelation. Such revelations are not always edifying but they undoubtedly feel real to the individual concerned. Many inhabitants of lunatic asylums have an unshakable inner faith that they are Napoleon or, indeed, God himself. There is no doubting the power of such convictions for those that have them, but this is no reason for the rest of us to believe them. Indeed, since such beliefs are mutually contradictory, we can't believe them all.      There is a little more that needs to be said. Evolution by natural selection explains a lot, but it couldn't start from nothing. It couldn't have started until there was some kind of rudimentary reproduction and heredity. Modern heredity is based on the DNA code, which is itself too complicated to have sprung spontaneously into being by a single act of chance. This seems to mean that there must have been some earlier hereditary system, now disappeared, which was simple enough to have arisen by chance and the laws of chemistry and which provided the medium in which a primitive form of cumulative natural selection could get started. DNA was a later product of this earlier cumulative selection. Before this original kind of natural selection, there was a period when complex chemical compounds were built up from simpler ones and before that a period when the chemical elements were built up from simpler elements, following the well-understood laws of physics. Before that, everything was ultimately built up from pure hydrogen in the immediate aftermath of the big bang, which initiated the universe.      There is a temptation to argue that, although God may not be needed to explain the evolution of complex order once the universe, with its fundamental laws of physics, had begun, we do need a God to explain the origin of all things. This idea doesn't leave God with very much to do: just set off the big bang, then sit back and wait for everything to happen. The physical chemist Peter Atkins, in his beautifully written book  The Creation , postulates a lazy God who strove to do as little as possible in order to initiate everything. Atkins explains how each step in the history of the universe followed, by simple physical law, from its predecessor. He thus pares down the amount of work that the lazy creator would need to do and eventually concludes that he would in fact have needed to do nothing at all!      The details of the early phase of the universe belong to the realm of physics, whereas I am a biologist, more concerned with the later phases of the evolution of complexity. For me, the important point is that, even if the physicist needs to postulate an irreducible minimum that had to be present in the beginning, in order for the universe to get started, that irreducible minimum is certainly extremely simple. By definition, explanations that build on simple premises are more plausible and more satisfying than explanations that have to postulate complex and statistically improbable beginnings. And you can't get much more complex than an Almighty God!         Richard Dawkins is Oxford's Professor of Public Understanding of Science.

						    urlLink Jonathan Power, India overtaking China   Watching India overtaking China By  Jonathan Power  May 6, 2004  LONDON - India is now in the middle of what many Chinese would give their right arm for- a general election. Yet China is the power that gets all the attention. When president Richard Nixon first went to China it was widely assumed at the time that the reason he ignored India and courted China was that China had nuclear weapons and could help balance the Soviet Union.   Since 1998 India has possessed nuclear weapons and can balance China. Slowly Washington is waking up to the fact that the tortoise soon might overtake the hare. Still the investors and the press continue in their old ways. Last year the inflow of foreign capital into China was two and a half times that into India. The press barely covers the Indian election whilst every day there is a story out of Beijing.  This skewed appreciation has been going on since the time of Mao Tse Tung. Whilst in the 1960s and 70s China basked in accolades, India's economic planners were widely abused. India was mocked for its "Hindu growth rate". China's people were fed, housed, clean and tidy, while India's were ragged, hungry and sinking into a trough of despondency- "a wounded civilization" wrote V.S. Naipaul.  Neville Maxwell of Oxford University was one of the more prominent of the legion of Western intellectuals who in the 1960s and 70s thought China had found the answer to underdevelopment. In 1974, he wrote, "Mao and his party triumphed where Stalin cruelly failed, basically because Mao understood and trusted the peasantry". It was hog wash.  With the 1981 famine we could see, to use George Watson's phrase, "the intellectuals were duped". As Watson exposed the romantic gullibility of Beatrice and Sydney Webb, Stephen Spender and Andre Gide and their glowing reports of the Soviet economy in the 1930s, so too the China seers of the 60s and 70s were held up to the harsh light of day. China had to beg around the world for grain whilst India had managed to survive the savage drought of 1979 without having to import a sack.  Would you be reading this now, if it wasn't useful to you? Get more quality articles in the future   Now with Mao long dead and the capitalistic reforms of Deng Xiaoping well into their stride the story is being repeated but in a more complex way. To many China's economic progress has been nothing less than spectacular. But inflationary pressures, bad bank loans, a fast increasing maldistribution of income and crime all threaten its economic stability.  India meanwhile has been gradually but with increasing speed loosening up its old Fabian socialist system. After a major economic crisis in 1991, finance minister Manmohan Singh (now Sonia Gandhi's principal economic advisor) introduced major promarket reforms and fiscal expansion and India's economy has never looked back. Annual growth averages above 5% and now thanks to a good monsoon is 8%. Singh believes that with more reforms than the present government has so far countenanced an average annual growth rate of 6.5% is sustainable- which is what he privately thinks China's over-hyped growth rate actually is.  In reality India is better placed for future growth. Its capital markets operate with greater efficiency than do China's. They are also much more transparent. Companies can raise the money they need. India's legal system whilst over slow is much more advanced and is able to settle sophisticated and complex cases. Its banking system has relatively few non-performing assets. Its democracy and media are alive and vital which provides a safety valve for the incoherent changes that modern day economic growth brings. India has religious riots, secessionist movements, urban squalor and bitter rural poverty. But the voters know they can throw the rascals out, and regularly do.  Moreover the massive flows of foreign investment into China are a two edged sword. It has become a substitute for domestic entrepreneurship. Few of the Chinese goods we buy are in fact made by indigenous companies. And the few that exist are besieged by regulatory constraints and find it hard to raise domestic capital. Its remaining state owned enterprises remain massive but bloated and possess a frightening number of non-performing loans from China's vulnerable banking system.  It is India that has created world class companies that can compete with the best in the West, often on the cutting edge of software, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.  India's trump cards are its language, English, its emphasis on maths in its schools (begun in Indira Gandhi's time), and the talents of its diaspora. For decades China has benefited from the wealth and the investment potential of its diaspora and the economic energy of Hong Kong and Taiwan. After years of ignoring its diaspora India is now welcoming them back- and they have much more "intellectual capital" to offer than China's, much of it coming from Silicon Valley where the Indian contribution has shone.
