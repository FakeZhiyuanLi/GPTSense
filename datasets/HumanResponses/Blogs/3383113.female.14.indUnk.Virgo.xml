      Well, this is my first ever post on this blog.Its seems a lot easier to manage than any other blogs Ive done before so I might actually update this one.Im not going to take the time to make my own layout though.That would take too much effort on my part.  My online alias is Spirit.I am a fourteen year old female living in Seattle, WA.I like soccer, drawing, singing et cetera et cetera.  Well, this is turning out to be an exceptionally boring first post.So now I shall inform you of my life doings at this time.  In my langauge arts class, I was cast as Juliet for the play Romeo and Juliet.I am excited.The only problem with the play is that the guy playing Romeo is about a foot shorter than me.It makes it akward when acting things out.But its still much fun.  I have a term project due tomorrow that I just finished.It decides my grade for this quarter in langauge arts and social studies so Im hoping I do well on it.*Crosses fingers*  By the way, wondering why I named this blog Death Wish?Well, just in case you were, I named it that because it seems as though everyone on earth has a death wish right now.Have you not noticed?People these days seem to be turning into suicidal clone freaks.Thankfully I have not yet fallen to their will but, how long can I stand alone?  Well, that was some bloody brilliant prose.(Im being sarcastic in case you didnt catch that.)Im killing myself with my own witlessness.  Oh well.Its almost twelve at night so I better go.

      Well, its true.Almost.I have three days left of school.I skipped the past two days because school was just getting boring.So I decided not to go.At the moment I am trying out hairstyles for graduation.I got shoes for grad today.They are really pretty, though a little pink.When I wear em you cant see the pink though.So thats good.  These curlers are really giving me a headache though.Theyre not very comfy.Im glad I can take them out soon.  I havent been doing much.I am grounded for a month though.Yes, sad.I was very sarcastic to my mom.I crossed the line and she grounded me.Three days remain to my sentence.  Im going to go watch The Last Samurai now.Ive heard its terrible.I guess Ill see soon enough wont I?Ta ta!

      Oh!I had the most fantastic weekend!I shall tell you about it.But first you should know that my best friend is named Elle and the guy I like is named Brandon.So, here goes.  On Friday Elle invited me to come with her down to this camp called Mayfield.Brandon was at the camp.We got there and I saw Brandon for like a split second and then we went to play lacrosse.Then we had to go on kitchen duty which is you know, cleaning dishes and such.Brandon was on kitchen duty too.Brandon kept teasing me cause he was in charge of the kitchen but that was cool with me.For a little while anyways.When he started flicking filthy water at me is when I decided he deserved to get a little wet.So I sprayed him with the sink hose.After we had a nice big water fight and dinner was over I went with Elle to chapel (this is a Christian camp by the way).Brandon didnt go cause he didnt feel like it.But then we were on night watch together.Night watch is where you stay awake and wander camp all night catching campers who are sneaking out and you make them clean things.Me and Elle got two of the girls cabins to sneak out and then we got them caught.We got everything cleaned.^^ We stayed up till four in the morning and then went to bed cause everyone else was asleep.The next day we were reeeeal tired.Surprise surprise.But then we had to wait for two hours while these kids got picked up cause they had a transportation mix up.But it wasnt so bad and I kicked Brandon several times for being annoying.Which was fun.Then we were driving home and we were all sleeping cause we stayed up too late on night watch.Once we got to Elles we all crashed in the living room.Brandon kept talking to me so I told him to bother Elle.He said she was reading so he wouldnt.I started reading.He kept talking to me.Throughout the whole thing he kept gently kicking my foot and pressing his foot agaisnt mine and pushing my foot.Oooo it was wonderful! -Daydreams...-
