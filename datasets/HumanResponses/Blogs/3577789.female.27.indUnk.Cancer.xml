      Well, I think I've finally gotten a lesson while working at Hastings that I didn't want to get.  Isn't it great how God sees a flaw in our character and he gently nudges until we realize it?  You see, I'm a creature of comfort.  I like finding a cuddly place and staying there.  Particularly where work is concerned.  That's not to say that I don't do a lot of work when I get to work.  It's just that I tend to like to go the easy route and I tend to like to stick to a set routine so I always know what I'm going to be up against when I head through the double doors to work.  Unfortunately for me, my department lost it's old manager and was replaced with a new one that likes that same comfy place.  When she first started working in my department, I didn't think she did any work at all.  Now that I've really taken a look at what's going on in my department, I can see that she's getting work done.  It's just the easy stuff.  It's not bad that she's doing the easier stuff.  The easier stuff needs to get done just like anything else.  The problem is that all she does is the easier stuff, which leaves the harder stuff for the next guy that comes in and the next guy already has it hard with close to begin with. So, when I would come into to close that department, the adrenaline would start to flow because I realized that there was more to do than time to do it in.  Because the first girl likes to do the easy stuff.  There's a lesson to be learned in that.  Kelly, my mentor, tried to explain this to me during our meeting on Tuesday, but I didn't want to hear it.  Why would I want to do the hard stuff?  Then I realized that it's not just the job at work.  I like my comfortable little places at home, too.  I run my household, that's my job.  As head custodial engineer of my home, I set up some rules for my husband to live by: If you dirty a plate, clean it.  My theory was that it would make my job eaiser because it would mean that the only dishes that I would have left to do at the end of the night would be the pots and the pans.  That wouldn't be so bad.  At any rate, it would be a lot less overwhelming than trying to do the whole kit and caboodle.  I set up another rule, if I cook the meal, then it's his responsibility to put the food away.  This meant I could focus my attention on doing the dishes after dinner.  Then came another rule, if you dirty the kitchen floor, you have to clean the kitchen floor.  My husband loves his dog like his own child, the problem with that love being that he'll let this muddy animal into the kitchen and leave a huge mess on the floor for me to clean up.  We have a good size kitchen, so it really is a pain to have to mop that floor more than once a week.  Then came another rule, if you're going to wash your hands in the bathroom sink, rinse the bathroom sink immediately after.  This rule is important because my husband loves getting dirty.  He loves getting sooty at work, then getting muddy from playing with the dog, then getting greasy from working on car engines at home.  So, when he would wash in the sink, the bottom of the sink would be dirty with a capital  "D".  Then I made another rule.  If you're going to shave in the bathroom, you have to wipe off the counter and clean the sink right after.  Afterall, I'm not the one that leaves dark black whiskers around the sink, am I?  Why should I have to clean it up.  Then, I made up another rule, if your friends come over and make a mess, you're responsible for cleaning it up.  All of these rules I made so that I would have an easier time cleaning the house so that I could focus more attention on the more important things like my son, or reading the Bible, or watching one of my favorite programs.  And it's not wrong for me to expect my husband to do a few things to help me out.  The problem with all of this, though, is that my husband likes to take the easy route.  So, if I refuse to mop the kitchen floor more than once a week, that's too bad for me because that will just make the job harder for me when it comes time because my husband won't clean the kitchen floor.  If I refuse to pick up after his friends right after they leave, that's really too bad for me because that means a mess will just stay there until I feel like cleaning it up (even vomit).  If I refuse to put the dinner away after making it, then that means that the food will spoil because my husband won't do it.  If I refuse to clean his dirty plates, then that just means that the dishes will pile up because he won't do them.  If I don't like having to clean up after my husband's physical filth, then that means that he just won't wash his hands when he comes home from work, he won't shave and he'll only shower about once a week.  Not a pleasant odor to live with.  My husband likes to take the easy route so that he can focus his attention on working with computers, working on cars, playing with his dog and playing music.    I have felt badly because of this.  I feel like my husband doesn't respect me when I ask him to do something and he doesn't do it.  I feel like my husband can't love me because you can't love someone you don't respect.  I feel like my husband wants me to suffer because he knows that I hate my job and that I only work there because he makes me work, and then he makes me come home and take care of the house all by myself.    The more I think about it, just because I feel it, doesn't make it true.  My husband and my boss at work don't really want me to suffer.  My boss at work hardly knows me and my husband loves me very much.  They don't want me to suffer, they just want to take the easy route.  They feel because they are working, (even if it's doing the easiest or most enjoyable jobs,) they are shouldering just as much of the burden as I am.  They don't know that what they do hurts me and more than that, they don't know _why_ it hurts me.  So, now I see.  Sometimes, taking the easy route is ok.  But only when it doesn't hurt anyone else.  If there is someone that has to come after me and do work, I should assume that they are already bogged down and work that much harder to make sure that the next person doesn't have to come into a war zone.    But knowing this is not enough.  Now it means that I'm going to have to start to live it.  So that means no more taking the easy route in situations where I know the easy route is going to hurt someone.  And that includes myself.  It's a hard lesson, Lord, You know how I don't like to do hard work!  But I'd rather do what You would have me do rather than what I would have myself do.  I know You have bigger plans for me than I could ever dream of.  Please help me forgive others so that when they leave me with much to do, I won't hold it against them!  This way, Your love can shine through to them!

      I know it doesn't really make sense to have two blogs, especially when they are both sort of journals of mine.  It seems there is a sort of trend of whinning, complaining and superiority on my other blog that I'm not sure how to dig my way out of on that blog.  Another thing that I don't really like about my other blog is that you would hardly know that I am a believer in Christ when reading it.  So, this blog is actually going to be part journal and part prayer journal.  Right now, I want to write about my friends in Kenya.  Kim, Carla, Jeff, Matt and Sarah.  I met Carla back in '95 (or maybe it was '93 or '94 I don't really remember as I wasn't really sure what role God would play in my life back then,) I remembered her as the one with the poofy red hair and singing voice that could fill a room.  I remember going carolling with Carla, Rod, Bobbi, and Randy (I think,) and it being very cold, but just loving to watch Rod jump up and down and to hear Carla belt out the notes.  I didn't come back to Instep church for nearly eight years.  I didn't really get to know Carla when she was at Instep.  So, I had no idea that she had a missionary's heart.  It's strange, but for not knowing her all that well, I really miss having her and her daughter sing in front of the church.  Not that Rod and Bobbi aren't doing a great job, they are doing a great job.  I just miss Carla and Sarah.  I wanted to make a quilt for Carla, but as she's already getting a quilt from her sisters, I've decided that prayer is the only thing I can really send her and her family.  Which I suppose isn't so bad as she just asked for prayer at the bottom of her most recent e-mail.  I didn't really get to know Sarah, Carla's daughter that well, either.  I just loved listening to her voice as much as I loved listening to her mom's.  I also loved hearing about her travels to various countries to bring the Word of God to people that so desperately need it.  The stories I have heard are awesome.  How cool would it be to talk to someone about the Bible that knows nothing about it?!  I did get to talk to Jeff more than a few times.  I told Jeff about how I was shot and we talked for quite a while about where he used to go to shoot target practice.  It was an interesting and fun conversation.  Jeff is waaay cool and I miss him, too.  I also got to know Matt a little bit after his family left for Africa and before he left for Africa himself.  You see, my husband doesn't attend church and my family is all pretty much catholic and they don't attend church often, so while my friends are in Sunday School, I spend my time alone in the foyer.  On a couple of occasions, Matt stood with me by the window into the sanctuary and we talked about random things.  I felt really at home talking to him and while I'll miss talking to him, I'm really glad that he's with his family.  It's tough to be separated from your family.  I know because that's pretty much the way that I have always lived.  Kim, I got to know most out of all of our missionaries in Africa.  Kim was a part of our Share group.  Kim is a tiny thing with a slight frame, but with a heart far bigger than her features will tell.  Her family, like mine, doesn't really attend church, so I was able to relate to her a lot while she was with us.  I was a little worried for her before she left, but I know she's in a wonderful place now.  Or sort of, anyway.  It's wonderful for them because they get to share the Word of God and they get to help meet people's needs.  What's not so wonderful is how great the need is.  The country in Africa in which they are currently staying is poverty stricken.  In their most recent e-mail, Carla wrote to tell us that one of the ladies that they have provided medication for is doing well.  She wrote on to tell us that her medication costs $60.00 a year.  That's all.  That's all that separates this woman from being able to communicate with her family and use her limbs and from having her arms locked up next to her body, unable to speak.  Because her family can't provide what is less than one fourth of the average American pay check, this woman has spent much of her life in a sort of shell.  I'm glad that Jeff and Carla are there to provide for that need.  It's heartbreaking to think that woman had to live that way for want of a few cents a day.    They also told us about the fact that in the town in which they live, there is no permanent solution to their waste management situation.  Can you imagine that?!  Imagine for a second that the garbage that you have collected over the week didn't get picked up by the garbage man, now imagine that week became two weeks, the two weeks became three, the three weeks became a month, the month became a year!  Imagine all that garbage piled up outside your house in the streets.  Jeff and Carla dug a big pit and with the help of some villagers, began to toss the garbage into the pit and got the street reasonably clean, but imagine having to do that all the time because they don't have a landfill or anyone to come collect or any way to collect the garbage.    Even worse than that is the condition of the hospital.  In their most recent e-mail, Carla mentioned that 80 children came down with malaria.  Inside the hospital, those 80 children all lay four children to a twin size bed with no sheets. Think of how easy it would be to bring a child in for a simple head cold with fever, then to bring that child out with something far worse.  It's a reality there.  There are beds enough to comply with the need for sanitization. Their parents also sleep next to or on the bed because they are the ones that go to the pharmacy, bring back the medicine and administer it to their children.  Can you imagine that? The hospitals can't afford to werehouse medication, so the parents have to pay the pharmacies for the medication and bring it back to the hospital.  Then, they have to administer it themselves because there are too few doctors to attend to the needs of individual patients.  They diagnose someone, fill out a prescription, move on. . . .    Then, there's the matter of their water.  Most villages have their water come from a spring in the ground that can mix with the mud.  Jeff and Carla helped put in stuff that would keep the spring for one village clean and clear of the parasites that send people to the hospital in the first place.  But there are several other villages that need the same supplies, but the supplies cost $1,100 dollars. . . .  The need in that place is so great, I wonder how God is going to move to have Jeff and Carla supply for it.  I'll just keep praying and try to remind myself that when things seem to become difficult here, how much more difficult they are for people somewhere else.

						   Things are just eerily (sp?) calm right now.  Not like my dreams, lately.  The night before the wedding, I dreamt of severed heads and strawberry milk.  I think I dreamt of the severed heads because of the scene in LOtR ROtK where the men of Gondor are trying to hold the gates of Minas Tirith and orcs toss the severed heads of the soldiers that were slain trying to hold Osgiliath.  Well, that and I had just gotten through with reading a blog about the guy whose head was severed in Iraq.  The truth is, I'm really enraged by that action.  The blog about that young man's death speculated that his death was the direct result of the Iraqi's hearing about the abuse of their detainees.  I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I have a hard time believing that a country that did not sign the Geneva convention should be able to expect that their detainees will be treated well.  I think it's more likely that they expect that their men and women won't be treated well.  So, I'm not sure if the beheading was really about their detainees so much as being about, "We'll strike fear in the hearts of the Americans by showing just how insane we can be when we are messed with."  Although, the thing that gets me is the ignorance.  How can they not know that such an action will only encourage flocks of Americans to come to their country?  We humiliated Hitler, Hirohito, Mussolini and we gave Ho Chi Minh and Stalin a run for their money.  Wherever there will be a dictator (or people that share a dictator's ideals,) there will be 15 Americans to deal with him.  Five to die for freedom, five to kick the crap out of whomever gets in the way of freedom and another five to occupy the territory until we can be certain that we will live without fear of tyrrany.  The people behind that boy's death had to know this.  It's throughout American history.  It's not hard to find out that America was founded by war (the American Revolution), America will protect her interests by war (Spanish American war,) America's economy is usually bolstered by war (WWII,) and America will fight to hold onto freedom even if she knows there is a chance she will lose (Vietnam).    A war against terrorists is even better because that means that the United States isn't actually bound to the regular rules of war.  Things like the Geneva convention and such were all directed towards a country's recognized military.  Not civilians with machine guns and dull knives.  This means a civilian caught trying to kill an American troop does not necessarily get to have representation, this means an Iraqi citizen that kills an American citizen while in Iraq does not necessarily get a right to a fair and speedy trial, this means that "detainees" might not actually be "detainees", but prisoners for life and there's nothing that anyone (including American lawyers,) can do about it because the rules were not made for these people.  There is no precedent for treating these people well.  The existing laws were created to deal with prisoners of war in recognized armies.  Several members of the same religious affiliation carrying weapons do not count as an army in the eyes of _any_ government.  If the Iraqis really want to push for better treatment of their detainees, then what they need to do is lobby with their own government to create a bill that will ensure their detainees are treated with dignity and respect. Then, they need to push to have that bill turned to a treaty that the U.S. must sign.  Killing some random person on Iraqi, Afghani, Pakistani, or Irani soil is not only needless, but to my mind something far worse: LAZY.

						   I've elected not to print my post about my visit to Portland.  The truth is, I was being a selfish, spoiled brat when I wrote it and I don't think that it would be quite fair to subject anyone to it.  Basically, what it comes down to, I wanted to see Tim and I wanted to see April, I just wish that I could have seen each of them independently of the other.  There was so much I wanted to ask about, but I was worried that the other would be offended by what I might ask.  I also wanted to visit a few places that I didn't get to visit on my trip (my husband was more interested in finding the Harley store- as if I'd really let him buy a motorcycle with all of our debts!)  Today, I was in a wedding. . . .  Actually, it was an ongoing sort of thing for the past two months.  Lemme explain. . .   When Adria mentioned that she and Jaymz were getting married, I made the offhand comment "Cool.  Can I sit with the family?"  Next thing I know, I'm joking with Adria about being _in_ the wedding.  Only, the joke was on me. What I thought was a joke turned out definitely not to be a joke.  About a year later Adria asked me what time would be good to go try on dresses!!!!  YIKES!!!!  I _totally_ could not afford to be _in_ a wedding!  So, you know how I get when I don't want to do something.  I hem, I haw, I'm absent whereas before, I'm EVERYWHERE.  One thing to Adria's credit- she's VERY focused.  No matter how absent I tried to be, she would find a way to make the situation work.  Ok, so I couldn't come with the rest of the girls to try on dresses, she'd bring me later to try on what the dresses had made it in the top two.  When it came time to spend the money on ordering the dress, Adria made the money appear.  When my mom nuked the bottom of the dress, Adria found a seamstress that was willing to work on the dress overnight.  When I couldn't make it to the wedding because my husband was at work, Adria found me a ride.  If the tables had been turned, I would have replaced the troublesome bridesmaid with someone that would be a bit more responsible. . . .  But she didn't.  She stuck with me.  So, I dove into my role.  I bought a pair of earrings, a can of hairspray, a bottle of gel, a panty-girdle, a strapless bra, foundation, lip gloss, a claw, a hair tie, and a ceramic curling iron.  I went to bed early, I woke up early, I set to with spackling, shaving my underarms, curling my hair, shimmying into the tightest panty-girdle ever (ok, I'm exaggerating, but not by much,) struggling with nylons, and nearly killing my feet by wearing the same waaaayyyy tight shoes I wore to my own wedding.  All told, I looked much better for Adria's wedding than I had for my own.  (Even with my mangled fingernails.)  Despite being incredibly uncomfortable due to clothing, I had a great time!  I got to see friends that I rarely get to see (by rarely, I mean like maybe TWICE a year,) I got to talk for a long time with my ex-boyfriend's mom and found out that she isn't nearly as scary as I had always believed that she was, and I got to meet some really nice people.  Although, there were a few wrinkles. I think I might have severely inconvenienced one of the other bridesmaids, I think my constant hovering might have made Adria nervous, I don't think Adria liked my joke about "are you sure you want to do this?", I'm not sure how my seating arrangement looked to Adria's family and I disagreed with something the pastor said (although not out loud).  Anyway, I've got a plastic cap full of revitalizer over my fried hair (the blurb on the frizzease hairspray bottle is no joke, when it says it will stay put, it seriously means that the hair-do will hold until you get in the shower and work water and shampoo vigorously into that spray-on superglue,) and I'm exhausted.

						   I know in my head that I should be doing the dishes right now.  I should either be doing the dishes or packing for my upcoming vacation, or putting my work clothes in the wash. . . .  Ok, I actually _did_ get up and put my work clothes in the wash.  I know that some corporate buttheads are going to be there today, so I need to "look professional".  That really gets me.  No one that wears their work garb at this job actually looks professional.  We look like a bunch of defeated people in green polo shirts and slacks.     In stead of doing basic house maintenance, I've opted to avoid responsibility today.  My feelings are feeling kind of fried.  So many things have happened so quickly. . . .  First, my share group almost disbanded.  So weird.  Over something so small. . . .  Then just as soon as it almost disbanded, it got back together.  Then I became paranoid, like I had done something to cause the almost-breakup and that I would soon be found out.  I haven't done anything that I can think of.  I did mention to one of the other girls in the group that we needed to make allowances for someone else in the group because this person might be dealing with one of their codependencies.    It's weird.  A lot of people think that codependency is either drug or alcohol related.  Codependency _can_ be either drug or alcohol related, but there are loads of other things that could contribute to it.  Once codependency enters the scene it becomes bigger than most people realize.  It taints everything it touches.  Suddenly, everything a person experiences becomes about experiences in the past.  So when you're dealing with a codependent, you never know if you're dealing with a situation in the present or a situation in the past.  Now imagine a whole group of codependents meeting together each week and that a couple of the codependents are dealing with clashing codependencies and that neither codependent is willing to admit that their codependency has caused the situation.  I'm wondering if _I_ should stay in the group?  I'm wondering if in helping to "fix" the situation, that the mediator within the group didn't just put a bandaid on a gushing wound.  If this is the case, then this group isn't at all where I should be.    Then there's the whole matter of not knowing what precisely is my position at work.  It's waaaay confusing.  For 1/2 of the week, this girl is my boss, for the other half of the week, I'm _her_ boss.  I'm a manager, but I'm an associate at the same time.  If it's confusing for me and I'm the one that's actually _in_ the position/s (?), imagine how confusing it must be for the people that are under me.  To some of them, I'm just another associate to be bossed around.  To me, I'm their boss.  So, I ask them to do something, they don't do it and tell me to do something else in stead and I write them up.  I'm ticked because they've just told me what to do and _I'm_ the boss!  They're ticked because, to them, I'm just another associate and therefore shouldn't know what to do anymore than they do.  More than that, they've never worked with me at the front counter before, so they don't know that I've done their job before and know what it takes to get things to run as swimmingly as possible.  A lot needs to change.  Let's not forget that during the other half of the week, I'm working in a department that looks like a war zone.  I challenge _anyone_ from off the street to come into that department and try to find something that even vaguely resembles order.  Seriously, this whole reformation thing is a worse idea than a fat man in a speedo.  Sometimes, I wonder if someone in corporate doesn't just sit in a tiny little broom closet of an office and think, "What can we do to tick off the customers _and_ irritate the associates at the same time?"  Then again, it could be a completely normal situation and I'm just not coping with it well.  We pulled my son out of private school.  I loved having him in a school that teaches not only school lessons, but about God as well.  I didn't even mind that my son, the poor boy in class, only had one boy show up to his birthday.  He was happy and that was what was important.  It was a matter of my wage.  I simply don't make enough money working at where I do to support sending my son to a private school.  It doesn't matter that I'm currently living in one of the worst school districts in town and that the one my parents live in isn't much better.  I can't afford to send my son to private school, so his education is going to suffer.  I wish that I could find some scholarship or grant that would allow him to remain at the other school, but now that I'm married. . . .  Well, you know how it is.  The financial aid offices expect the spouse to kick down money to send the child to school.  But what happens if you marry a man that thinks "Because I didn't contribute to the child's birth, I shouldn't have to contribute to his future."  I wonder if it even vaguely matters to my husband that he is the only father my child has ever known?  But maybe this is a good thing.  i'm not catholic and i don't believe in some of their doctrine.  Perhaps having my son in another school will close some of the less important doors, but open some of the more important ones?  This is something i'm going to have to remember to pray about.    Then there's the stuff with my husband.  We've come a long way, to be sure. . . .  We're just both in a frustrating place right now.  My husband wants me to change and I want him to change.  We both make half-hearted attempts to change, but we never really talk about _why_ we don't want to change.  I'm not sure there would be a point.  My husband would probably say, "You only work part time.  Why can't you keep the house cleaner and consider getting a second job?"  I would probably say something like, "I may work fewer hours than you do, but you work less days than I do.  It would be as easy for you to get a second job as it would be for me.  Besides, these bills that you want me to pay are _your_ bills.  Why should I have to suffer because _you_ are irresponsible with money?  I offered you a means to correct the problem, you're not willing to accept the terms, so _you_ can live with your decision.  Furthermore, I wouldn't mind cleaning up a bit more around the house if you were willing to pick up after yourself.  I'll admit that I can make the lion's share of the mess, but you contribute a great deal as well as your friends.  I'm not your mother, I shouldn't have to pick up after you.  Not if I have to work.  Why don't _you_ get a second job, why don't _you_ pick up after YOURSELF, why don't _you_ do something about the way my house looks?  Do you think I enjoy living with your band junk in my living room or having all that junk in my kitchen?!  Admit it, you're just as bad about keeping the house in order, if not worse!  If you're not willing to change your ways, bub, I'm not willing to change mine, so you might as well just get used to the situation as is."   Not to mention the fact that I feel like my head is butting up against the ceiling and I want to go somewhere and do, I don't know, SOMETHING with my life. . . .  I'm so fed up playing the failing wife and the failing video/manager position.  I want to do something that I'll actually ENJOY.    Wow.  Now that I think of it, maybe there's a lot that I should be praying about.

						   Been wondering why i call my blog something better than hastings?    Today would be the reason.  Last night, I worked in the video department for the first time in weeks.  I knew there was stuff going on in the video department, but I had no idea the extent. . . .  It was almost complete chaos.  The assistant manager for the store expressly told me not to try to clean up the mess in the department.  She told me that it may look like chaos, but it was   organized   chaos and to leave it alone.  So, leave it alone, I did.  All I did was attempt to help guests and fix what I could of the best renter wall.  It doesn't sound like much, but when you consider that with things as unorganized as they are, that it  can take me 15-20 minutes to help just one guest and that I usually help anywhere from 9-15 people in a given shift, then you'll realize that just helping the guests is even more demanding than working at the front counter.  Not only did I help several guests, but I also went to the flex register three times, I checked the drop box and checked in videos at least four times, I helped and I covered for T****** when she went on her lunch break.    I did all this while watching the clowns at the front counter do next to nothing.  I'm not exaggerating, either.  When I say next to nothing, I mean that I didn't see the front counter associates stocking candy, bags, cups, lids, processing used videos or checking videos in.  The most I can say that I saw them do was to check guests out (which was done so slowly that lines went out from the register to the music department,) and take movies out to the floor (which was only done after someone else brought them in and checked them in).  I have no idea where the manager was.  I didn't see her most of the night and when I did see her, I saw her chatting with someone (not a guest).    At the end of the night, the front counter manager told me that there was used product for me to take back and that she wanted me to help with videos.  After all the extra work I'd done that night for the front counter, no way was I willing to stay late so that all of the front counter associates that did jack for work that night could go home.  So I told the manager in no uncertain terms that I was not at all willing to help out.  So the remaining front counter associate snapped that i should just put the used product away.  So, instead, I grabbed the basket and set it on top of the video counter and left.  This afternoon, when I came into work, I overhear T******, J****** and M*** all talking about how I didn't do my job yesterday and that I'd left things in disarray.  I went from being in a reasonably good mood for me, to being so angry that I couldn't talk.  I stormed out of the breakroom to start my shift and just as I did so, one of the girls that was talking about me emerged from the front counter office.  I didn't say anything to her.  I just blew right by.  The assistant store manager came up to me about a half an hour later and asked me how I was doing.  I explained to her what had happened as calmly as I could and she told me that the reason that she came to talk to me was because T****** found out that I heard everything and had felt really bad about it and that T****** felt as though she owed me an apology.  I told the assistant store manager that I was fine and that I didn't have any hard feelings.  Later, T****** apologized for what she said and apologized that i had to hear it.  She went on to say that she had no idea that the assistant store manager had instructed me not to touch anything in the department.  I didn't know what to say to put her at ease that I was fine with everything, I just shrugged and told her that I was fine.  Later, J****** apologized to me in her own way.    The truth is, I wasn't fine.  I wasn't fine at all.  It wasn't so much that they were talking smack about me.  Everyone talks smack about everyone else there.  It was that two of the people that I have noticed are most likely to shirk their duties were the ones shouting the loudest when it seemed that I was doing the same as they do.  I was livid.    But it's not just the backstabbing that gets to me about this job, it's the guests that demand that I cater to their every whim, it's the special needs guests that need the extra care that a regular guest doesn't usually demand, it's the projects, the little extra things, it's getting on my nerves.  I don't want to continue selling videos, I don't want to get rid of late fees. . . .  I want to work at a job that I actually love.  Whatever that may be.

						   I talked to Tim today.  We're meeting on Monday.  I'm nervous and excited.  And wishing that my husband would want to meet and talk to Tim, too.  I know I'll be going solo.

						     I almost forgot about checks.&nbsp; If you're going to buy anything with a check, have your check and ledger made out _before_ you get into line.&nbsp; When you don't, you cause the clerk's transaction time to go up (which can get them yelled at, written up, and in some cases FIRED,) and you hold up the line which makes everyone in line impatient with both you and the checker.&nbsp; And the checker isn't even the one that's causing the offense.&nbsp; Seriously, getting a lot of register time does _not_ mean you're getting your money's worth, it means that you're behaving badly.

						     Alright.&nbsp; I think it's time I set up rules for consumers to follow as you all seem to lose common sense once you set foot in public.       &nbsp;   1. Do your own shopping.&nbsp; This means that when you come into the store, come into it knowing what you want.&nbsp; Do _not_ ask an associate to list all of the songs done by a particular artist because you can't remember the name of the song.&nbsp; Find out the name of the song BEFORE you come into the store.&nbsp; That's what google is for.&nbsp; The same goes for asking an associate to look up every movie a particular actor has been in.&nbsp; Go to  urlLink www.google.com  and look for what you want THERE first.&nbsp; I guarantee they will be more of a help to you than the overworked associate will.&nbsp;        &nbsp;   2.&nbsp; Do your own shopping.&nbsp; This one is similar to the last one.&nbsp; Do NOT walk up to an associate and ask them to find something without looking for it yourself first.&nbsp; As I said before, these associates are overworked.&nbsp; They have a myriad of things to do that do not include grabbing a shopping cart and going to various departments of the store to get everything on your list for you.&nbsp; Don't be lazy!&nbsp; Look for your items yourself and if you can't find the products you are looking for, _then_ find an associate to help you!       &nbsp;   3. KNOW AND FOLLOW STORE POLICY!!!!&nbsp; Store policies are usually prominently placed throughout stores, some stores even go so far as to have their policies printed on their receipts.&nbsp; If you can't find any information on a certain store policy, it doesn't hurt to _ask_ an associate _before_ you buy a product what the store policy is regarding said product.&nbsp; Time and again, it would have saved employees and guests a lot of grief if the guest would have made an effort to find out what store policy is for returned items.&nbsp; Because of the increase in pirating technology, it's no longer viable for stores to accept as a return item opened VHS tapes, Casette tapes, DVDs, CDs, or any kind of video game.     Seriously, if you buy something and decide later that you are unsatisfied with it, you're stuck unless you are willing to trade it straight across for the exact same item.&nbsp;        &nbsp;   4. Do NOT under ANY circumstances (yes, this includes people who are clinically depressed, mentally challenged, are suffering sleep deprivation or people who have suffered a recent loss,) treat an associate poorly because they won't bend store policy for you.&nbsp; These are people, just like you.&nbsp; Just like you, they do their job to the best of their ability.&nbsp; Just like you, if they break store policy, they are written up.&nbsp; Just like you, if they are written up three times for the same thing, they are FIRED.&nbsp; Often, store policy will upset you.&nbsp; Often, the company does not allow any lee way for an employee to help a disgruntled guest.&nbsp; This means that if an associate helps you, they can be FIRED.&nbsp; Likewise, the corporation relies on return guests, so if a guest makes the same complaint more than three times about the same associate to the boss (doesn't really matter if they do it in the name of following corporate policy,) that person can be FIRED.&nbsp; That means that person might not be able to eat, might lose their place to live, might lose children- you get my point.&nbsp; When you do this, you're not just hurting the corporation, you're hurting the employee.&nbsp; This is something I'm not going to mince words about, if you do this, you are behaving VERY poorly.&nbsp; No matter what mental or physical state you are in, you can't tell me that you don't know right from wrong.       &nbsp;   5. Do NOT try to get things for free.&nbsp; Seriously, these are companies, not Unicef!&nbsp; I understand that inflation is high, employment is down, and gas prices are going through the roof.&nbsp; Times are tough.&nbsp; While I understand your plight, it is _your_ responsibility to come up with the money to pay for the things that you want.&nbsp; This means that if you want to rent a movie, but don't have the cash, you don't get to rent the movie.&nbsp; You do _not_ come into&nbsp;the store and say that the movie you rented the last time was defective just to get a free rental.&nbsp; This is STEALING.&nbsp; This means that if you want a soda pop, but don't have the money for it, you go without.&nbsp; You do _not_ claim that you received poor customer service when you did not and this means that you do _not_ get into the longest line that you possibly can to complain about how long your wait in the store was.&nbsp; This is STEALING.&nbsp; If you want two smoothies instead of one smoothie, but don't have the money, this means that you only get one smoothie.&nbsp; You do _not_ complain about getting a bad smoothie so that you can have two.&nbsp; That is STEALING.&nbsp; If you want a certain product, but feel that the price is inflated you either buy it or leave it.&nbsp; You do _not_ try to haggle with the associates to get a better price.&nbsp; They are not authorized to&nbsp; give it to you at a cheaper price and if they do, they can be FIRED.&nbsp; More than that do _not_ make a scene because you feel that you should get a free rental because the movie you are looking for is not in stock.&nbsp; Some stores do guarantee a few titles, but no store guarantees every title and some stores don't guarantee titles at all.&nbsp; If you can't find the movie you are looking for, look for an alternate title.       &nbsp;   6. If you want to special order something, you _HAVE_ to give out contact information.&nbsp; This is store policy because it costs the company money to ship special order items.&nbsp; That means if a guest is never notified that their product is received, so they never come to get it, we have to send it back to the vendor and the store takes a loss.&nbsp; More than that, if we receive a special order product and you haven't come to get it by it's sell date, then another customer can purchase the item.&nbsp; The contact information also ensures that the item is really held for the guest.&nbsp; You cannot special order things under someone else's name and contact information.&nbsp; You have to give out _your_ contact information.       &nbsp;   7.&nbsp; An associate is not responsible for the coherency of a guest's request.&nbsp; That means that if a guest does not state what they want clearly and concisely, the guest can not expect exemplary service.&nbsp; In other words, the formula looks like this: poor request + associate confusion= customer dissatisfaction.&nbsp; If you do not feel that you can effectively communicate to get what you want, try shopping on the internet or try bringing someone with you who can interpret for the associate what you want.&nbsp; The formula looks like this: Coherent request + correct assistance= customer satisfaction.       &nbsp;   8.&nbsp; Do not complain about waiting in long lines.&nbsp; I assure you that associates are doing everything they can.&nbsp; Sometimes, a store can be short staffed, or a guest can come during a busy time (12pm-2pm and 5pm-8pm are generally really busy Saturdays and Sundays are almost always busy throughout the day and October-January are really bad months to shop,) which can make it hard to keep lines moving.&nbsp; Just be patient.&nbsp; Everyone has to wait at least one point in their lifetime.&nbsp; (Also, it's generally a really bad idea to go shopping if you are in a time crunch.&nbsp; So, if you're worried about getting back to a loved one in the hospital before something happens to them, choosing to go buy some things at the store might not be the best decision in the world to make.)       &nbsp;   9.&nbsp; Keep your children with you at all times!&nbsp; Associates at a store are not your children's parents.&nbsp; They shouldn't have to pick up after them.&nbsp; That's _your_ job.&nbsp; More than that, associates are not babysitters.&nbsp; So, if a child pulls down a display on themselves because you are not paying attention, it's not the fault of an employee, is it?&nbsp; Associates are not babysitters.&nbsp; So if your child gets kidnapped while you're off getting a "break", it's not the responsibility of an associate.&nbsp; It's _your_ responsibility to look after your child.       &nbsp;   10.&nbsp; Do not pull an associate from another department because the associate in the department you are in is helping someone else.&nbsp; Be patient and wait your turn.&nbsp; The associate in the other department has guests of their own to take care of.       &nbsp;   11.&nbsp; Do _not_ bring in your special needs&nbsp;clients to a store so you can get a break.&nbsp; Caregivers are not entitled to "breaks".&nbsp; Caregivers are there to give care to their special needs clients.&nbsp; End of story.&nbsp; Most associates are not educated in the special needs field and have no idea how to help these guests.       &nbsp;   12.&nbsp; If you spout "the customer is always right" at an associate, do not be surprised at the reaction you get.&nbsp; You have it coming.

						    I know, I know, foul!&nbsp; Still, I couldn't resist.&nbsp; Besides, it's aptly titled.&nbsp; It seems I've messed up again.&nbsp; Same thing.&nbsp; I tried to set a friend up.&nbsp; I shouldn't have done this.&nbsp; It's always a bad idea to set a friend up because when things go badly, I always seem to bear the brunt of the anger of one or the other person.&nbsp; I should have kept this in mind as I tried to set up the last couple, but I didn't.&nbsp; So, now, again, I am to blame.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   &nbsp;

						    Wow. . . .  i know, i know, it's been a while since the last time i posted to my blog.  It's also been a long time since i've responded to any e-mail.  The truth is, i've been in a kind of funk and didn't want to subject anyone to it- no scratch that.  That's not entirely true.  It's more that i didn't want anyone to think badly of me for the things that have been coming out of my mouth (or, rather, my hands,) lately.      It's so easy to forget that things aren't all that bad.  i just got an e-mail from one of my missionary friends in Africa.  She gets her water from the rain, which gathers in her gutters and fills up a tank in the back of her house. . . .  But worse than that, the people around her are going without food daily, surviving on one small meal (or maybe two,)  a day of rice or beans. . . .   And i freak out when i have to eat nothing but ramen for a week!       The first thing i thought when i read her e-mail was  to send her village some goodies so that they didn't have to just have rice and beans.  Then, i realized that i didn't know the customs laws and that it might not be entirely legal to send things like dried fruit and nuts across the world via something like FedEx.  Even if i did, i realized that i had no idea where to send it to.  Now, i realize that maybe that wasn't the plan for me at all.  Maybe all God wanted me to do was just change my ungrateful frame of mind.      i've been really ungrateful, lately.  i find the whole submitting to my husband thing to be kind of difficult.  It would be easy if submitting didn't mean that i had to do the laundry, put away the laundry, clean the bathroom, clean the kitchen, clean the living room, clean the bedroom. . . .  Now, helping my husband tape drywall and paint walls, that i'll do without complaint, but ask me to do a little thing like actually  clean the house  and watch me completely lose it. . . .        i'll bet there is someone in Africa right now that is wishing they had dirty dishes piled up next to the sink.  It would mean they had something to eat.  More than that, i'll bet more than one of them has marvelled at the thought of indoor plumbing.  Imagine for a second that you had to walk down to a river to gather water, to bring back to your house just to wash dishes.  Now imagine that you didn't have soap to wash them with, just water.  My friend in Africa has also written of hospitals where eight children share one bed, parents have to go to pharmacies outside of the hospital and bring back the medicine for their children to take (if they have the money for the medicine at all).  It boggles my mind.  No wonder all of the people in her village think that Americans have an endless supply of money!!!!  Imagine living in a world without indoor plumbing, without electricity, without even a garbage dump or garbage collectors!          And i get all ticked off because i work at a job that i can't stand.   i'll bet that there's more than a few people in my friend's village that would nearly fall over themselves if they saw the total on my paycheck. . . .        On to other things, i threw out every comic book i owned today (except for one that my husband bought for me almost three years ago.  there was some sentimental value there, so i thought it might be a good idea to keep it. :) )  it feels kind of good, getting rid of those things.  Not only have i made just a little more space in my bookshelf for my paperwork, but i've also gotten rid of some of the garbage from my past that  doesn't exactly go with the morals that i have now. :)  Granted, it's just a start.  There are still some books and cds that i need to toss.  But, that will come with time.  i'm finding that it's better if i take things slowly.  i'm finding that if i rush things, i don't seem to learn the lesson that i need to learn and have to start the whole lesson over with another situation.        Speaking of lessons learned. . . .  As i was going through my old comic books, i found some hard copies of old e-mails one of my exboyfriends had sent me.  In the past, when i'd reread these e-mails, i'd gotten really depressed.  You see, in one of these e-mails, it seemed to me that my ex-boyfriend was blaming me for an outcome of our relationship with which he was less than pleased.  And why not?  i certainly blamed myself. . . .      i was so angry with him for so long for pointing his finger at me.  For longer than i care to admit, i'd been pointing my finger right back at him.  After rereading the e-mails again, i realized that i'd been so angry at myself for this situation, that i let those feelings cloud over what was actually written in the e-mail.  From what i read tonight, he was actually accepting that he had at least a little to do with the situation and was trying to communicate that he didn't want to fight with me anymore. . . .      i feel like a small burden has been lifted from my shoulders.  Actually, that's not the only burden that God has removed from me.  A friend of mine from highschool came into work the other day.  When we were in school together (and since then,) i did a lot of things to hurt this guy because of some unrealistic expectations that i had.  So, when he came in, i apologized and he accepted my apology.  It felt really good to hear him accept my apology.  It felt even better when he let me hold his newborn daughter. :)  So, God blessed me with the release of that burden and blessed me again by letting me hold that little girl.  i can't begin to tell you how it felt to know that this friend from highschool trusted me enough to let me hold that precious baby :) .      It almost looks as though my share group is beginning to heal from a nasty situation, so there's another blessing.  My mentor pointed out that i have a problem with submission, so now i can let God work within me to correct that fault, so that's cool.  Blessings are everywhere, if i stop being so stiff necked and just look!
