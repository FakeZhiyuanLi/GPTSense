      Well well well, it's Saturday already. A boring Saturday, but better than nothing, I enjoy getting work done earlier than Sunday. Read the US Chapter, doing some math now. Made a secret trip out to get a money order to purchase some stuff via-mail order, so be very hush hush about it. It is my x-mas present to myself, along with a coupla books that I bought with the remnants of my b-day money from May. Yeah, I'm turning into a staunchy old coot, putting my money in a lockbox in the closet. Oh well, now I have no money to fall back on in case doomsday comes, but I guess that's a risk I'm just going to have to take.   One more day of freedom, and then the finals push begins. At least I have crystal concert this week instead of right at finals, that was horrendous freshman year when the Finals Before Christmas tradition started. I like it, I would hate studying over break, though I dislike finals studying in general.   Visited downtown naperville today, wow what a transformation. The entire place is decked out with Christmas ice sculptures and the like, and every store has started their major push for the holiday season. I really dig the downtown scene during the holidays, be it in Chicago or Naperville, everything looks cool, and people are very friendly.

      Oh boy, thanksgiving dinner was amazing, chocolate pecan pie, amazing. It was all good. Great company too, though grandpa decided to give me magazine articles about things that he wanted to ask me about, but figured it out on his own and wasted my time. We almost had to watch a one hour special on Spain that he taped, but my dad just turned on football, because the special was really boring.   Because we botched the turkey last year by not having it done in time, we got it done WAAAY ahead of time this year, and then brought up a frozen turkey to the kitchen when my aunt stopped by. We really had her going for a few minutes, she thought we forgot to thaw the turkey again, HA! Another brilliant idea from yours truly, it was sweet revenge for my dad (he and my aunt are always playing jokes on eachother). Paul stopped by, he's looking well, no longer obese, just a normal fat, but that's good, another heart attack would not be cool.  Paul's daughters and their boyfriends dropped by later in the evening, they were all exhausted and bored, but it was nice of them to show up.   Tomorrow the grind starts, math test and APUSH chapter, this will not be too fun. If I get it done tomorrow, I'll at least have the weekend.  I'm putting ornaments up tomorrow, I don't care if my sis says that it's too early for x-mas, we always put up ornaments the day after Thanksgiving. Nothing quite puts me in as good of spirits as I'm in now than great turkey, and this turkey was amazing.

      Yes, good times tonight, finally got my ping pong stroke back. Certain things about the nights get to me, especially around 11. Under the lights I'm feeling almost entirely out-of-body, where only my hands have feeling. Yeah, I must be losing my mind...  Happy Thanksgiving to the friends on the East Coast. Yes, it is 16 minutes past midnight right now...over there...  Transcribed some stuff today, not very much, but about 8 measures of Clifford's stuff isn't to shabby for an inexperienced musician like myself.  It's fun having awkward conversations with people that you have nothing to say to. It's even better to read what someone is venting toward you for no reason at all that you can think of, until you can muster a two word answer that makes all that they had typed appear virtually meaningless in the scheme of the language.   Talk more to this girl, get more frustrated with my actions. Yeah, that's life.  I'm thinking too hard about certain things, and getting nowhere fast.  Better save myself the frustration and get my mind on something else. Oh well, that is all for right now.

      Went to mongolian today...again. I need to stop going there, I live there. Nice to have a free meal though, courtesy of Wes's money well. Yeah, too competitive with ping pong though, gotta stay focused...  Turkey day is tomorrow, that's nice. Today was boring. Maybe later people and me will work on the new movie entitled "Bill of Lefts". I might lift tonight or something, I'm not particularly inspired to write anymore at this point.

      Ah, the amendment of mediocrity.  What a worthless post this will prove to be. What has transpired in the past hours? Next to nothing. Played ping pong, lost. Played PS2, won. No big deal, so why post it at all??????  EGhhhhh....  Pissed off again for no reason. Could it be the recent surge in weightlifting that has turned me into a testosterone-fueled metalhead? Possibly, though I doubt it. Something has to give soon so I can relax again. Depression is for pussies, I'm not depressed, I'm pissed off. Pissed off enough to pick a fight with your grandmother and spit in the face of your retarded nephew. Why I am is a good question, things are relatively going well. I'm not pissed at the environment as much as I'm desiring some improvement in my performance...but whatever, here I go bitching again. Give me a guitar, and then a shotgun, and then call me the best thing to ever happen to rock, and marry me to a coke-head that has a crummy band. Yes, then the cycle will be complete...  This is a silly post all of the sudden, how refreshing. I'm starting a new reflection essay for the Post Horn on America's 21st Century Manifest Destiny. Ahh, tiredness is sinking in, Conan is on soon...the tv will guide me through whatever waters I may pass, yes, buy more useless prescription drugs that may or may not help you to prevent possible bone loss which might could maybe should possibly lead to osteoarthritis, regular arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Maybe if I developed rheumatoid arthritis, I could be Lindbergh's grandson, yes, glorius.   Ok, this is pointless all of the sudden. Last statement is here: Whatever I'm in, it's a bad funk, and it started two weeks ago for one reason or another, I'm being a complete girl about it and letting it get to me, so hopefully with some turkey and iron it'll pass.

      YAY, no more school until December. Nothing like a two test and one essay day, thank god they were easy. After lifting though, all the stress just came to a head and I friggin lost it. I was once again in the worst mood possible at the end of the day, until we played Elsa's Procession in Wind Symphony, that was cool, great song. It was one of those days when you talk to people but they just ignore you, or at least you think they do. That happened at least four times today to me, which should be no surprise, but it wasn't very cool especially in the bad mood I was in. Not that I was looking for any real conversation, it was just simply, "Hey, how goes?", but still, I'm amazed at the arrogance at some people that they're 3 feet away from me and don't bother to say hello. But I'm probably wrong, it was just the bad mood.  More craziness in APF, my teacher had no clue what the hell I was doing except it quote "Looks like it hurts", and yes, it hurts sooo good. I've renewed my addiction to lifting, it took a break after the summer widowmaker sessions. I couldn't stand much more of high rep snatches followed by sprints for 45 mins, but it trimmed me down, so it's all good. Down even further in weight, soon I will be more beastly than now, and that will be nice...  Great weekend coming up, I love chilling w/ my entire family, such great people, and funny too. I still have a math test to do and a history chapter to read, but who cares? I have a week to do it. Maybe if I feel really grade-grubberish I'll do it tomorrow.   New goal for the week: don't watch TV until December. Not that I watch a ton of TV anyways, but a good goal. The less I watch TV, the more unnecessary and silly I find it to be 98% of the time. I'll read some more of Kant's "Critique" that's good shit. Ok, time for ping pong, I'll amend this later...

      Yeah, definitely not a cool day. Get a math ws back, bad score, what else is new? Stressful day tomorrow, two tests, an inclass essay, and another math ws due early morning. For thanksgiving week, this is rather stressful. Less to write today, boring day. Definitely got pissed off at wes today and spit on his car, very not cool of me, I'll have to awkwardly apologize tomorrow or something...  Renegade rows and side press in APF, I swear I'm the only person who uses free weights, everyone else is a machine-monkey. For all the lifting and good eating I've been doing, I should be a beast by february.   Headache + tired = bad. Too much math on the brain. I'm gonna go practice sleeping.

      Yeah, so dig this:  Pops decides that 10am means wake-up time for Chris, so he storms into my room and practically yells at me why he decided to wake me up. He thinks he's saving me from oversleeping. Here's the catch: I fell asleep at 3am. So yes, 7 hours of sleep, I'm really pushing the limit.   THEN, le douchebag can't figure out how to get the dvd player to work in the basement, so he yells for me, and I unplug a cable that was kinda confusing the TV into doing what it wasn't supposed to be doing. Voila, it works. Do I hear a "Thank you"? No, just more bitching. bitch bitch bitch. "You need to leave it so that other people can use it". And that's another thing that gets me, why use pronouns if you know EXACTLY who you're referring to? "Hmm, looks like SOMEBODY didn't take out the trash" Really, is it a mystery? How difficult would it be to say "Hmm, Chris, you didn't take out the trash" Not that difficult. But you see, doing things in a civilized way all the time is hard for le douchebag. He needs to be a prick 24/7 as revenge on everyone around him for........well, we don't know yet, but it always goes back to some time in the 7th grade that I didn't make my bed for a month, very contrived and odd. But I keep my cool, knowing that if I open my mouth, I'll have to clean up the crazy mess that it leaves. Oh, you say no more??! There is... So of course, le douchebag goes and bitches to mom, who promptly laughs at him, and then he comes back and reprimands me for sleeping late again. This boils my friggin blood. He sits on his ass all day and watches TV and DVDs, and suddenly I'm lazy? I swear, it's like he's retarded. 50 years old, and he acts like he's 5.  So I spent my day doing what I do: lifting, hw, a light nap. It was satisfying. Nothing relaxes me quite like the lifting. Renegade rows today were a bitch and a half, I'll see if I can do more in APF tomorrow. Got some math done, that was nice, now that I know what I'm doing. My motivation is odd in math, because on one hand I hate math, but on the other, I'm decent at it when I really try, so why not try, eh? Then of course, the standard going around the internet looking for cool shit to put on my x-mas list. X-mas lists are difficult for me, because I'll write something down and go "Do I need this?" and then I'll conclude that I don't, and I'll have a single item on my list: slippers, and yes, I need them badly. It's cool, better to want to little than to want too much, I suppose.   This week should be alright, aside from a stressful tuesday complete with inclass essay and 2 tests, whoopee!!! We host thanksgiving, so I'll be helping out, socializing, bartending, etc. Been awhile since Uncle Paul has been over, supposedly he's changed form from the original Heart-attack-waiting-to-happen physique, thanks to a bow-flex. Good for him, he's already had one heart attack. He's a funny guy though, really funny, great foil to the craziness of Uncle Bill and le douchebag. Hopefully he'll bring Katy and Kerrie, they're HOT. See, they're not really my cousins b/c his marriage to my aunt is his second, so Katy and Kerrie have no blood relation. Which is good, very very good. Paul knows my motivations, he's cool about it. Nothing better than sitting around shootin the shit with Paul or even Bill on a familiy get together. If Kelly (actual cousin) brings Brinton, I'm not gonna be happy. That kid is such a tool, it's amazing. I'll throw a kettlebell at his ass if he says anything, yep, happy thanksgiving brinton...  New Outkast album is very good, I suggest it to anyone who isn't deaf.  Well, I'll just sit here and do...stuff, i guess, until something happens. Yeah, this whole blog thing is too long.

      Headache + math = bad times.  For some reason, I always write really well when I have a headache. Maybe because I'm too pissed off to go on tangents and all that, but no matter.   Does anyone realize how much they depend on AIM for communication? Honestly, it's frightening. You stagger around late at night, log in, and hope to see some sign of civilization just to socialize, and then are crushed when no one is online. What a large hammer of power this service holds over daily life. Personally, I find AIM to be too much of a distraction from what I should be doing....like math right now.... But no matter, no one is online right now, so at least I have this silly blog to ramble on and on about until I go into the next paragraph, pick up my math book, or pick up my APUSH book....but headaches aren't fun...  Don't you just hate people that fish for compliments? If you do, then hate me too. Oh look, I did it again, how very awkward that was....  I've written a little too much in this blog today, I'll assume that all my entries will be on either weekends, good days, or bad days. I'll spare you (the captivated audience) the mediocre days, not because they're not interesting, but because they blend together and oftentimes I can't distinguish between them.  Yep, variety show was today, definitely didn't go. Was this a bad decision? I won't find out. Bad question, Chris. (yeah, i'm losing it)  Breaking news: 100K Troops in Iraq until 2006. Wow, it gets worse every day. This is turning into Vietnam all over again. So we'll be occupying Iraq, but the Iraqis will have gov't control????? How does that work? What if the army says, "No, you can't do that"? Does that mean that we'll be driven out like the imperial armies of Britain and France were all those years ago? I'm sorry, but we are doing a shitty job over there, and throwing more people in for cannon fodder won't do anything. This isn't D-Day, more does not equal better. Go to  urlLink www.hackworth.com  he knows his shit, read his books, NOW!!! We need some good officers damnit. If only Clark would get the DNC nomination and win the presidency, then we might have a shot, maybe even w/ Dean. But w/ president lame brain, it's all bad. Now I see why General So-and-So who led the attack into Iraq quit so early- so this mess wouldn't be pinned on him. Nothing against the guy, the politicians (wolfowitz, cheney, rumsfeld) planned this war, and it sucks. Colin Powell is probably shitting bullets just listening to their bullshit about the war. We need some good leadership in their pronto! Read up on your military history kids, it does good for ya. "Steel My Soldier's Hearts" first, by Hackworth, great book, read it now, life lessons, not corporate b.s. but actual lessons. This conflict will be our generation's Vietnam if something doesn't change. Plus, we have virtually NO coalition, so we'll be relying on the SAME TROOPS just b/c we don't have enough force to occupy two areas (Afghanistan and Iraq) at once. Hmmm, anyone feel a draft? Maybe not now, it seems to improbable now, but if the shit hits the fan, it wouldn't surprise me. Would I serve? As much as I hate this war, I would. It is against my honor to disobey my country. Shit, they're even screwing over the marines. These guys are terminators, first to go in, and now they're on babysitting duty because the army leadership doesn't know what do do aside from fortify positions and wait for an RPG attack.   Divebomber pushups hurt, I reccomend them along with renegade rows. Good shit, I have to firm up my chest a bit.  Well, I'm off now. I'm in a bit of a reading mood, I'll save the math for tomorrow so I can remember it for monday. Time for some Kant and APUSH book reading, oh yes, I said APUSH Book reading. Nothing like antebellum America for ya, wow, what a crazy place. I'll be up until 2 am tonight for sure...at least.

      Ah, good day today. Nothing like waking up at the crack of nine and then doing physics for a few hours. Very grade-grubberish yes, but I hate working on sundays, too much of a depressing day.   So I went to this formal dinner thing at church tonight, lots of fun. I kinda feel like a jackass for not showing up in awhile and talking to all the great people there, but they were still very nice. It was good talking with don again, haven't seen him in ages. Good to get the update and all. That's what's cool about people like don, you don't see them for awhile, but as soon as you do the next time, you can hold the same type of conversation that you could when you were friends. Great people over at Knox Presbyterian  But, really, I'm quite a different person from last year. And right now i'm on the caffeine buzz, so it's flowing. Lifted once already today, but by the time this post is over I'll be at it again. Kettlebells are my drug of choice, and I'm still not physically where I want to be, so its time for ass-kicking. Too bad my foot's not quite healed yet, or I could do some one-legged squats. I'm thinking those would hurt just about now.  Yeah, dad lost the digital camera. He loses many things, but this one is kinda important. I haven't said anything to him about it cause he's more pissed at himself than any of us are, plus we have to treat him with kid-gloves just b/c of all the stress that he's under. I took about 10 minutes to debate with myself on if I should wake him up from his nap to ask him how to iron my clothes for the formal. Not that he needed the nap, but things like that come back to bite me if I forget to do something...or something of that sort that gets him riled up. But it's all good, no money out of my pocket.  Good thing I spent that unnecessary 50 bucks on flowers last week, I'm freaking broke. I had a nice little security fund in my closet, and now it's going under heavier lockdown so I don't touch it now. I need to carry smaller denoms of bills, bringing only 20s around is bad, especially at a meal, then you have to pay for someone else until they can pay you back. I mean, it's no problem paying for friends who don't have the dough, but I don't like to be without a little walking around money in my pocket. Still, 50 bucks on flowers, yikes. I should have realized she wasn't into me, but whatever. I guess it's better to have tried, right? Whatever though, back into the cave I guess. That's what I get for being overconfident. I just can't stand seeing her in the hallways or in school, it's like if you've hit someone in your car, and they're your next-door neighbor, it's just weird, she's a cool gal, but it's weird. It's just turned into every other friendly relationship I've had with a girl, in other words, they ask me for help on their homework, and that's about it. I swear, even the goddamn gradegrubbers ask me for help, I'm gonna start denying it. They're getting 208% in class b/c of my ideas, and i'm getting an 89%, definitely not diggin that.   here's a life lesson guys: don't think a girl is into you until...well, you'll know. and then, if you screw up, don't listen to radiohead non-stop, it's kinda unnerving. Jeez, 9pm, and I have to lift and do math. Ah, what an exciting saturday night it shall be.

      Yeah, so this is my first entry in my blog. Thanks to donlambka.blogspot.com, I have my inspiration!!!  Here's the introduction, I'm a highschooler, I'm into music, I'm big into russian kettlebells (www.dragondoor.com), and I'm guessing my method of posting will be completely irregular, scattered, and grammatically incorrect, but who cares. I like to rant, and you'll find that out by reading this blog. Ok, no more introduction is needed, it's too long already....

      I actually did stuff today. Not cool. Math puts me in a bad mood, maybe because I'm not good at it.  I lifted today for 2 hours, and completely lost track of time. 10pm really snuck up on me today, it feels like 7. Productive day though, broke out of a funk, good times.  Best of Loveline is on, I love this. Best. Radio. Ever.  Tomorrow is bridge day. That'll be fun/bad/boring/good. Yes, all of those things. I really need to have some recreation of some kind, maybe another movie or something. Erg. Not too much APUSH hw though (as I just learned this minute), so that's very good. I don't like more work.  This post is really dry...not good. I think I wasted all my creativity today on that essay for english.  Kinda sucks about Iran, 25 thou dead. That's really awful.   New Years...I don't have any plans, and it doesn't look like anything will happen. Too bad, I usually do something even though it's the most overrated holiday of the year. I'll probably just stay up really late and watch all of the performances on the Dick Clark thing. Or I'll go motoring.  That's all for now

      Yeah, so I was going to write some philosophy late at night, but catch this, my sis is on the iMac...ergh.....go away, down to your own computer. Nothing quite like talking with Don, always something new, always predictablel. Nevertheless I was being a pain in the ass, but too bad.  I sure do like this iBook, it's so smooth and nice and the keyboard is very quiet. Someday I'll have a powerbook, yes...someday...  Yeah, tomorrow I will start on my hw, because I have to, there is no other option. Shouldn't be too bad though, I'll polish it off in 3 days and then spend the remaining 4 doing nothing like always.   Saw the new lotr, it was amazing, no one can honestly not like that movie, it's just tooo good.  I got no sleep, but the excedrin is keeping me awake, that's the price i pay for terrible sleeping hours the past few nights, I'll pay for it tomorrow when I'm lifting. Too bad.  So I really need to write this philosophy stuff down or read or something, yeah, i'm bored, you don't have to tell me I'm rambling. And I'm talking to no one...it's too late. Sorry to anyone that reads this. Worst post ever.  Off I go to kick sis off the iMac. I might post again if I feel so inclined.

      I just realized that I've been blogging more in the last week than in the last month. That's what vacation boredom does. So got to visit with uncle and his girlfriend, good people, good times. Plus, I got some chocolate pecan pie, very super good. I think tomorrow I may go to the mall, clearly it is a huge deal seeing as I've put it off for three days now. Speaking of slacking off...  Tomorrow I get back to the grind, ergh. Start the bridges, finish all remaining hw, and the like. Should take at least 3 days of pure work, but that's okay, I have nothing else to do. But if you have any ideas, please call me at 630-334-9114, I'm at the point right now where any contact with the outside world would be fantastic. I've just got bogged down in the holiday and all of that, soon this silliness will end. I'm dreading school less and less as the days go on, I do like how I have a ton of vacation left though, this is nice.   Hmm...I'll be staying up very very late tonight, splitting time between the computer and reading, should be productive. At least I lifted today, so I don't feel like too much of a lazy bastard. Tomorrow the pain continues. Oh, the price I pay...so worth it.  It is 60 degrees in this house, and it's great. I like the cool weather. My slippers feel nice, I'm already wearing them out, very cool.   Oh there is so much music to listen to. Maybe I'll stay up until 2 tonight, yes, sounds fun. Time for pjs, adios.

Don't spend so much time in front of the computer.   2. Read all of these books: Critique of Pure Reason, Works of Nietzsche, Art of War, About Face, Cukoo's Nest, and that other war book.  3. Do the kettlebells more often, stop slacking off!!!!  4. Stop being so damn assertive, it gets me nowhere.  5. I have to shave my head at some point during 2004  6. Transcribe every Lee Morgan and Freddie Hubbard solo that I own  7. Improvise better  8. Get through Calc BC somehow  9. Do well on all those tests and related bs  10. Get Eagle Scout award  11. Outgrow the current Kettlebell  12. Finish the general philosophical writings  13. Put out at least one Muted Post Horn  14. Get a job  15. Get a girlfriend  16. Start getting more sleep  17. Stop eating shitty stuff (not that I do too much nowadays, but yeah...)  18. Prevent Ian from voting for GWB in the election  19. Learn Russian  20. Build a spaceship  21. Not be an asshole  22. Get some respect  23. Build house on moon   Hope you enjoyed reading.

      And so this is the day after Christmas, and what have I done? Absolutely nothing. I need to start doing things, this is getting boring. We have company over tomorrow, should be fun. I didn't go to the mall today, but I think I might tomorrow. I did pick up som Nietsche (sp?) at borders, that was fun. Yeah, True Lies is an excellent movie for all you Arnold Schwarzenegger fans, just thought I'd mention that after watching it.  But yeah, what the hell is with all the natural disasters? I have no answer, surprised?  Hmm...my toes hurt...time for a trip to see mr. scissors, hahahaha  I have more jazz than I know what to do with, and that's good. My trumpet playing is awful right now, this needs to change. I can't go from playing extremely well to terrible in the course of two weeks. That is not good. Plus, we're recording for a jazz thing in New York, and if I don't have my act together, it will be bad sounding on my part, which is bad.   OH man, I ate so much pizza and pop today, this is terrible. Tomorrow...eh....sunday I'll start caring again. Tomorrow is the conclusion of holiday festivities, so we're having Christmas dinner all over again, this time at my house. Should be fun.  I'm very pleased with all my Christmas gifts, I don't feel like it's too excessive, and I didn't know all that I was getting for the first year in awhile. I'm going to try to just realize that the post Christmas depression is for idiots, and try to move on, despite how truly sad it is that the cool holiday season is pretty much dead in another week.   Today dragged on forever, it seemed like Christmas was a week ago rather than a day ago.

      Wow, I feel like such a chick now. Dig it:   So I have 2 new shirts that you kinda have to wear a t-shirt under...or so it is to look decent. So now, I'm pouring over shit at the abercrombie site to see what t-shirt I'll buy tomorrow at the mall w/ some of my Christmas money. Wow. Pathetic.  Add onto that my need for shoes, cause my other ones are getting ratty, so I'm looking at these nice shoes by report, and thinking "wow, this is what it has come to." I tell you, this is getting annoying. I do need those shirts though, just two tees and I'm all good. Shoes are not necessary. Ugh, where the hell is my testosterone. Lifting...I miss it. Tomorrow it starts again, I can enjoy the pain. Kettlebells must become part of my rotation again, things just got too crazy in November/December, 2nd semester is always a little lighter until about May. I can't wait.   Plus, I have 2 bridges to build, some APUSH work to do, a godamn math packet, and an essay. Woohoo. I'll polish that off tomorrow if I'm lucky. That meaning everything but the bridge, math, apush, and yeah...I'm lazy. I'll do it the weekend b4 we get back, or in one week. I'll be bored out of my mind by that time.  So we saw christmas lights tonight, an amendment to last night's episode. Dad, drunk, says, "I want to see the lights" OVER AND OVER AGAIN LIKE A GODDAMN TWO YEAR OLD!!! Ugh. He's such a puss sometimes. So we drove around tonight for a freaking HOUR, it got real old real fast b/c no one puts up lights anymore. But anyways, he was pretty well sloshed since it was Christmas Eve and we were celebrating, but he was not going anywhere like that. So we told him plain out that he wasn't good to drive and all that, and that we wouldn't drive him. He got us back tonight. It took awhile, and nothing was too spectacular. But whatever, he did what he wanted and we shut up for a little while. As much as he pisses me off with his acting like a toddler, I have to contain myself sometimes and let him have his fun before he completely loses his mind. He's got a gut on him now, he says, "I'm on Atkins", which is a lie and it doesn't work anyways, and then lies about his weight like a freaking girl. He's starting kettlebells next week, and he will enjoy it or he'll run.   I might be doing my manmaker stuff again with the KBs, I don't know yet, but I might. I think I'll do it once a week, and the other times just my normal craziness. Yes, that will do well...  Ugh, I'm thinking of going to the mall tomorrow. I've been to the mall maybe three times in the last three years. Damn, what's happening? I feel like staying up late tonight, too bad I missed loveline.

      Yes, happy Christmas to all, and to all a good day. Great morning, I must say. I received clothing, and that makes me happy because I needed clothing that actually fit. That's the downside to getting yourself in good shape, you have to buy new clothes, and they usually cost more than the other ones you didn't care about. But anyways...  I also got a calendar of Bushisms, it will be fun to read that daily. The Cool Water gift set was nice too, now I can completely immerse myself into that scent with the shower gel, deoderant, and cologne. Very nice. By the way, the Dave Matthews Band Live in Central Park CD is mind blowing, best live cd they have. I got a coupla jazz cd's too, which will be good cause I have to start transcribing some stuff if I want my improv to improve. Ha. I just realized how funny that looks when it's typed out.  I haven't listened to DMB for awhile, I think I'm due for some. It's such great music, no wonder why they're my favorite band.   I also got a nice FM transmitter for my iPod, so I can listen to things wirelessly. But enough of this self-absorbed drivel, this isn't what Christmas is about.  Christmas is about hope for a peaceful future, which is what we need. We don't need any more suicide bombings nor retaliation attacks, nor assasination attempts. It doesn't help that we're occupying to countries right now either. Given, they need us more than ever to help them rebuild, we need to do a better job and stop risking the lives of our volunteers. Just imagine Christmas in Iraq when Muhammed Al-Generic decides that nothing says yuletide like small arms fire and an RPG. Let's try to remember those guys in Iraq and get them back as soon as we can. We need a better rebuilding strategy. Capturing Saddam means nothing, he had no power anyways. According to the Pentagon and CIA, most insurgents have no loyalty to the man anyways. They, like any other historically repressed people, don't exactly want an occupying force around. That's too bad for them, because without us they'd be worse off. However, we need to win this guerilla war so we can rebuild without the threat of attacks looming.   But enough of my random thoughts, you know how I feel about this entire situation. We need different leadership that doesn't circumvent the Pentagon in its military planning. Vote Clark, I beg you.  So I get to go to Aunt Heather's today, and banter with Paul about random stuff. Should be fun, Paul's a great guy. Maybe his daughters will actually stick around and say something to someone...or maybe not. They're reclusive like that. But who can blame them?   I'm really digging these new threads. You have to hand it to Abercrombie, they do a great job of selling you clothing that looks about 20 years old. Oh well, it feels nice and is lightweight.   So I have 50 bucks now. What should I spend it on? That is my dilemma. As much as I don't like useless spending, it's Christmas time, so it's all good. I'm thinking CDs. Maybe I'll get some shoes instead. I don't know. Probably shoes, I have enough jazz to transcribe for the time being. As much as I dislike Steve's view of music, I'm going to start doing what he does with jazz. Transcribe entire solos, highlight the good parts, play in every key. That way I might actually start getting better. Hmm...  Gig on thursday after break. I expect you to be there. I'll let you know where it is.  Feliz Navidad!!!

      Yea!!! Christmas Eve!!! Yeah, so my mom hinted that I'd be surprised on Christmas morning by one of the gifts that I receive. I wonder what it could be...  Usually we have a nice little fiesta on Christmas Eve, but my uncle and aunt, who happen to be compulsive liars, made plans to celebrate Christmas Eve with some other people, which is retarded because they've been celebrating it with us for 15 years. Retards. I swear, they had such a good life but squandered it on random expenses and gambling. Idiots. Better off without them, they can get liquored up somewhere else tonight. I'm fine with spending Christmas Eve with Randy and Family. Good times.

      Wow, what a great night. Nothing beats having some quality conversation and having energy galore. I haven't felt this good since the beginning of November. Kinda sad, eh? Oh well, it's the truth. I'm writing more stuff now, collected essays I suppose you could call them. They're all very spacy and I write with my sophisticated tongue in them, or at least that's what Wes and Pat say. Hopefully I won't lose my rhythm with these things, I'm on the verge of a breakthrough that I call Cartesian Trancendentalism, yes, make fun of me now....  This is what I get for thinking so darn much, three billion essays and a whole lot of lost sleep on not being able to "digest a conversation" (-Don). So it goes as Kilgore Trout would say....  New Duke CD, this is good, live jazz is pure and sweet, just like cocaine...  Definitely doing KBs plus my random divebomber pushups tomorrow. oh yes. pain is my friend.

      Things are not good. Dad's back is spasming and he's in the basement, so he's not leaving. That means I can't do my KB work (as selfish as it sounds, I need to do my KB work more than he needs to watch TV in the basement rather than upstairs). I want to do my KB work. I can't get out of shape over Christmas, that would not be fun. I still have a long ways to go anyway.   The Neil Diamond Christmas album is playing now. Best Christmas album ever, I swear.   It's nice right now. Music playing, low light levels, tree is on, feels like a nice winter night. Of course, I'm in 3 layers because it's about 63 degrees in the house, or at least thats what the thermometer says. I don't believe in thermometers, it's colder.  I got 10 pages through "Critique" by Kant. It's gotten very heavy lately, he writes faster than I understand. I take 10 pages as a huge triumph. It was all about how space and time are not absolute in trancendental reality because they are merely conditionals that we use to classify objects (confused yet?). I always thought of space and time as absolutes, but it turns out that what I thought was deep thinking on my behalf barely scratches the surface of pure reason as defined by Kant. I'm enjoying Kant's stuff a lot, I just hope that I can still write my own stuff without too much of his influence showing.   The guys at dragondoor came out with a new book on bodyweight exercises. Sometimes I wish I didn't have so many options. I could: 1) Do a bear routine in APF  2) Do a standard routine in APF 3) Do the kettlebell thing 4) Do the bodyweight thing  So many options!!! I think I'll stay on my Bear cycle with APF for the time being. I plan on terminating the cycle around the beginning of 4th quarter, when I'll start my raw strength building stuff.   Things are confusing now. And by confusing I mean reminding me of things I messed up on and therefore pissing me off. That's as far as I'd like to go about that. I like the good intentions, but it just gets me thinking on something that could happen but probably won't.

      Yes, Christmas time is here. Aren't you glad we caught Saddam? Just think all of the....wait...that was Bin Laden. Where the hell is that guy anyways? Ok, Saddam's a terrible monster evil person, but honestly, the war was still unjust. No WMD, no visible connection to Al Quaeda. Sorry for writing about this now, a week after we got him.  So I had the last day of 2003 in school today, very underwhelming. I got out around 11 b/c I lacked a 9th period final. I'm zombie-like right now, I just can't move too fast...it won't work. Maybe it's because I've gotten about 8 hours of sleep in the last 3 days...maybe...  Plus, I did a "Bear" set in side press today during my 90 minute APF "final" (aka, just lifting like always). That was sweet. My arms grew at least a quarter of an inch today. I live for doing this type of stuff. Like Wes says, I hope I don't turn into a complete asshole for all the lifting I'm doing.  Bought the Jet CD. I enjoy listening to it with both of my ears at the same time.  Less than a week until Christmas. Hopefully, Chase Wes Pat Ian and I will go to Chicago on Saturday or something. Downtown is amazing, my favorite city in the world. I've been to London, Madrid, New York, Detroit, and Chicago. Chicago is my favorite. Especially around Christmas time, the downtown area is just amazing. We'll probably take a train down there or something like that. Chase knows chicago well.  minkus is playing tonight, but I'm not going. I don't feel like moving. Did I say that already?  My uncle and his girlfriend will be in town next week. That'll be fun, they're great people, and by great I mean best people you could ever know.  Still have hw over break. Gotta build two bridges, do some APUSH, tune up my Truth essay (it's good already), and probably do something else that I didn't mention. Oh well...  Wes Clark is not polling well. It doesn't look good. Even a Dean/Clark ticket would lose. We need clark as the number one, he's the only canidate with a decent vision and a chance to beat GWB aside from Kerry (who imploded). I have some books on war that I got, I think I'm going to read them. I have this strange facination with Vietnam, maybe because it's still relevant.  I'm getting many clothing items for christmas, it should be nice. I need clothing items.

      Whew. The worst finals are over. Here's the breakdown:  Calc BC: AAAAAAAAAAAAGHHHHHHH. Studied hard, no matter, 3 questions killer. Physics: WOOHOO. APUSH: Definitely got a 98% Spanish: yep.  Ok, there it is. I really need a haircut now, my face is starting to kind of clear up, that's a plus. Christmas time is here, pops got a job at a car dealership, I think he'll do just fine. Any income is better than none, so I'm happy about that. I want to see the new LOTR so bad along with Cold Mountain. I have much to see and do. My combo has a gig in January, so we have to prepare. We're playing hava nagila, summertime, cantaloupe island, and powerhouse (that song they play in cartoons when some factory is making something). Got my essay on truth back, it was very well written, best thing I've ever written. Maybe I'll enter it into a contest or something, I don't know. Things w/ the ladies are confusing as ever, I've given up on being assertive, back to being a pussy. I'm assertive for a semester, and it does me no good. Sucks. I have to do stuff over break. Oh well, it's not bad. I can't wait until christmas, I'll finally have some clothes that fit me. I have APF final tomorrow. Which means I get to lift for 90 minutes, hell yeah! I love that class, right in the middle of the day, just goin in a busting my ass. Especially since I do the old-school dangerous lifts that get my my "street-cred". Yep, I'm a weirdo.

When I woke up I was about to do something that wouldn't have been good. Too much stress right now. Between the "decision", the ladies, and finals, it's just not cool. Add on some psycho-good APF training, and I'm tired as all hell. I need some relief!!!!

      Did physics problems today. My brain is fried. Too much physics. Worst part: I'm not even done. 1 day to do the next lesson that we will learn tomorrow and all 27 conceptual questions. Agh.  Wrote a 3 page essay in under an hour today about the definition of truth for english class. I think it's the best thing I've ever written.  I'm just fried. I took a nap, so I'm not tired, but any complex thinking right now is out the window. Tomorrow will be fun...I suppose. I think I forgot to do some spanish hw, so I may need to get to school early tomorrow. Pathetic, eh?  Week before finals, review time! Only one test this week, and a take-home test for APUSH, should be fun...

      Whew. Lot's of stuff to cover since I haven't updated this in a few days. First things first...  CRYSTAL CONCERT Wow, fantastic. We didn't do so hot in Jazz at the 6 oclock Friday show, but we burned it up at 8 and on Thursday. Scott Williams is a piano god, stars and stripes forever in a swinging version never would have happened without his cool ballad-like intro. Personally, I played at my best every show, which was amazing. I credit it to this new thing I've been doing...but you wouldn't understand since you're not a weird brass player like me....  Wind Ensemble/Wind Symphony "Elsa's Procession to the Cathedral" best song I've ever played in an ensemble. I feel honored to play with such great musicians and to have my sound in the midst of that ensemble. We nailed the 8 oclock performance like no other, even Mr. Staley was excited about it (and it has to be perfect for Staley to have the reaction he had).  We're being considered for another Grammy. This is the first year I'll be included on the submission CD. Very very cool.  SECONDLY Spanish field trip was cool. Visited some grocery store in ghetto-aurora and spoke clear spanish to these mexicans that really didn't want us in their store. Oh well, I guess you're always bound to make someone angry. After that we went to Meson Sabika for some good Tapas style dining (many courses of small portions). Yes, that was very very good.   I have too much homework this weekend. Mucho physics that I put off during the crystal concert, some math, and an english paper on the meaning of "truth" which should be fun to hammer out at midnight when I have nothing else to do and am in my deep thinking moods that are just strange...  I had youth and government pre-leg 2 for 6 freaking hours today, and it sucked. We had some attorney on an ego trip when he was supposed to be teaching us how to write a brief. I got caught up in his cycle a couple of times, made a good argument even though it was useless in the context of state law, and then muttered things to Wes about what a douchebag the guy is. Yes, what a prick, I wanted him to die.  Got some new cologne, we'll see how this smells...   Grandma's in the hospital, she had a minor heart attack. This does not surprise me, her health has really blown lately. I feel like a jerk for not caring more, but honestly, she and my grandpa care very little for my sister and me and more for my cousins. It's very apparent that they dislike Katie and me, and that they also dislike my dad, which is sad because they're his parents. But what can you do, eh? She's okay, but she might need a bypass surgery in a worst-case scenario. The heart-attack was like the weakest one you can have, so it could mean anything, honestly, it's not even close to being a concern of mine right now. I think she'll be just fine.  Big pension decision this week. Wish us luck, he needs it.  Finals in two weeks, I'm not worried for anything except math and physics, physics should NOT be bad though, math will suck eternally and I will do terribly.

      HELL WEEK  Tomorrow begins the strenuous part of hell week. I'll be at school from 6-9 on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. I really do not have a lot of homework, which is a blessing, but tonight I have to co-author a DBQ, and probably finish my physics lab report (that is, if I can remember what we did...) before going to sleep. I will be waking up early every morning this week. Today for Jazz, yesterday for a useless Youth and Gov't Krispy Kreme delivery (no one ordered any goddamn donuts, we wasted our time), tomorrow for breakfast club, thursday for youth and gov't again. Luckily, I've been drinking Chai in the morning, and the caffeine helps me wake up. I'm dead by the end of the day, though, which explains why I'm chilling now rather than working on my lab report.   I think I"ll take a nap, yes, a nap.  Breakfast club should be fun, I hope we actually discuss something this time, I think Lauren is on the verge of not showing up. I can't blame her, it's been lame lately. She's really bright though, and it will be good for our discussions to have her input.  House to myself tonight, thanks to the swim and diving banquet. Haha, naptime here I come...

      Weekend. Yay. I'm actually doing pep band today, I don't know what's gotten into me. I have stuff to do, so I should be busy this weekend, which will be nice. But, I'll need to get a jump rope sometime today...or so I think. I made a "Dapper Swindlin'" playlist last night. BEST PLAYLIST EVER. So much dixieland stuff, it makes you feel like you're in the 1920's where dapper swingling is the cobtobbler. It's just too fun of music not to listen to.  Yeah, I don't think I did as well as I wanted to on the APUSH test, but oh well, I'll make it up. PE isn't so fun anymore that I'm paired up with a guy that doesn't know what the hell he's doing. Oh well. At least Nick is in the group, and he does know.   This Wilco CD is good.  I have stuff to do. Ciao.

      Yeah, I haven't updated this for like a week, but here we go.  Kerry is going to win NH, I still hope Clark does well. As long as Dean is out, I'm satisfied.  I played a gig tonight at Traverso's w/ my combo. Though it went okay, I need to get serious about my improv, I've been putting it off lately. Hopefully tito will give me a call to let me know when lessons start. That'll be soo much fun when they do, he's a jazz god. Best part of the gig: free food, oh yeah.  I'm taking my training a bit more seriously too. What am I training for? Tail. Yep. I'm a bastard.  So I'm doing this thing called HOC (see www.mikemahler.com for details) which is pretty much the manmaker but less boring. Instead of just running after kb snatches, I do crazy bodyweight drills like down-ups, burpees, and hindu squats. It's very rough, but it'll get me cut just like the manmaker helped me out in the summer. If there's one thing I know for sure is that you have no chance w/ the opposite sex unless you're physically appealing. The whole personality stuff is bullshit. So I'm trying to improve my chances instead of sit on my ass and bitch about superficiality. It's reality, deal with it.  But yeah, I'm working on this appeal now for Youth and Government. I've found my calling. Legal-ese flows out of me naturally, and deciphering previous cases takes me very little time. I am thoroughly enjoying this. As far as math goes, I started off poorly, so I practiced all my shit yesterday, now I'm a master. That's my new philosophy, do something so much that it becomes second nature. It's worked for all the lawyer argumentation stuff, hehe.  This semester I'm switching it on, 1st semester was all f-ed up from my foot injury and music stuff and all. 2nd semester is free-range goodness, and I'm at the helm of the ship, finally.  As far as turnabout goes, I don't even know what day it is, and I don't care. I'll not get asked, which is normal for me, but it's no biggie. I'm rather apathetic right now as far as dances go. Good thing I mentioned it, right?   Bedtime for bonzo.

      Good day. I got Tivo. Now I actually can watch tv, and skip the little bits of advertisement and stupid stuff that I dislike. Plus, I can watch whatever I recorded whenever, so yeah...I can watch cool stuff now that I've been missing. Wow, I need to give up TV one of these days, I think Tivo is like some sort of godsend that keeps me away from the tv for a long period of time. Surgical strikes on tv programs, amazing.  Tomorrow I go to chicago with chase, wes, and lucas. We'll take a train, it'll be grand. Chase will take us to cool places, he knows cool things to do. Hopefully we won't freeze our asses off.  I tried HOC (high octane cardio) today. It's like the manmaker I did in the summer, but indoors and less crazy. My goal is to get my body comp at a decent level so I look a little better. Not that I'm not lean already, but you know, it's all marketing and image, so I'll just succumb to it all and sell out. Whatever, I'll still be able to kick your ass if you say anything about it. Ha.  I feel inspired, must be the caffeine. We'll see what happens tonight.

      Good day, I guess. Hanging out with Wes was fun, until I started losing at madden. I can't stand losing in anything...it's just not cool. I'm not a perfectionist, just fiercely competitive. Worst part is, all the sports teams I was on earlier in life sucked...yeah, that's probably the cause.  Monday is Chicago day, which will be fun despite the freezing cold that I will endure while wandering the streets with chase. He knows everywhere in chicago, will be fun, definitely.  The goddamn combo is falling apart. David has no motivation, kevin has too much motivation, tommy is just right, and we have no drummer. This sucks. And we have a gig on tuesday or next monday or something at Traverso's. Fantastic.  ON the plus side, I'm starting lessons with local jazz god Tito Carillo soon, so I will be better at improv, and therefore good. I really could care less about my lead playing, I just want to improv better. I think somewhere deep down inside I want to go to a music conservatory for college, but that's less likely to happen than me becoming a teacher, which isn't out of the realm of possibilities.  Right now I'm seriously thinking about college. I just hope I can get into University of Chicago or Northwestern. One of the two would be fantastic.  MY EAGLE PROJECT JUST GOT APPROVED WOOHOO. So I'll make my phone calls and get to work. This'll be the greatest achievement of my life, I know it. I've worked....over 10 years to get here, can't wait. More to come.  I'm doing my high intensity training again, I need to start looking better than I do now, which is better than I looked a year ago. Things need to change. No offense to the ladies, but they have very high standards that I need to live up to just to compete. Yeah, this will be difficult.  It's very cold down here.

      holy crap, it's 10pm on sunday night and I'm not tired. I guess that's what excedrin does. However, caffeine is my drug of choice, so I'm on a huge buzz right now.

      Ok. here's the college essay I had to write for english.  Prompt: There are limitations to what grades, scores, and recommendations can tell us about any applicant. We ask you to write a personal essay that will help us to know you better. In the past, candidates have written about their familes, intellectual and extracurricular interests, ethnicity or culture, school and community events to which they have had strong reactions, people who have influenced them, significant experiences, personal aspirations, or topics that spring entirely from their imaginations. You should feel confident that in writing about what matters to you,k you are bound to convey a strong sense of who you are.  Whew.  here it is:  Halfway Point  Staring down at my sunburned legs, I wondered how and why I arrived at this point, eight miles off shore with another seven to go. In a sea kayak with an oversized oar, I paused taking in the scene and letting my intuition wander. The ocean lay to my right, populated with gulls and frigate birds diving in for their afternoon meal. To my left lay the calm resort beaches that are commonly found in the Florida Keys. I let myself drift toward the sea, fixed my gaze, and soon began to row farther out from shore, toward my destination. 	The sight of Big Munson Island was that of marred landscape. Trees uprooted from last year’s hurricane, lobster buoys hanging from trees, and a thick line of mud encircling the beach. Halfway in between the sea and the continent, I was alone with a crew of seven, living off of packed provisions in small A-frame tents. It was somewhere in between a vacation and a primitive setting, and I was a self-made castaway.  	My first mistake was acknowledging that mosquitoes exist. Once I did that, the sores swelled while I anxiously swatted over my entire body. I called it “carpet swatting.” I prayed for rain daily, did rain dances, and sang rain songs in my attempt to out-psych the sun. Before venturing out, I promised to have a good time, and at this point that promise was being broken. Then it came. Like a divine chariot, my crew’s Duskee Speedboat arrived, and carried us far away from the island prison. For a day, I was free from Munson’s wildlife and odor, and out to sea for a fishing excursion.  It was the embodiment of a perfect day. I caught more fish than I could count and swam with fish that I had previously saw through a glass pane at the Shedd Aquarium. Like a dream, it came to a crashing halt. The rain I had prayed, sang, and danced for was on its way in form of a storm, and the sea adventure was cut short as we rocketed back to Munson in the boat. I was hurled back into the jungle, and thought about the day while I sat in the rain.  The next day, I stayed. My crew left for a second day of vacation, I stayed on the island. I was feeling rather transcendental that day. So I sat, alone in my kayak, a quarter mile offshore, observing my surroundings as I had on the first day. Switching my gaze between Munson and the sea, I pondered the harsh beauty of the island, and the possibilities the sea lent itself to. Finding my equilibrium, I sat alone in my kayak, halfway between the ideal and the actual. Much like college, Big Munson Island was a venture away from common environment, a place where I could explore my natural potential without interference, a place halfway between naivety and maturity.

      Wow. Best night ever, I swear.  So we all went to the Pizza Hut restaurant for Pat's (aka God's) birthday, which was fun and funny as hell. Most of the people that were there were acqaintences, but I got to know them more through the night, and they're really great people. Not to mention Wes had his "A" game going, joke-wise. Definitely the funniest he's ever been.  Until he chucked his car keys in the snow and then couldn't find them.   So Pat let me borrow the CRIC (Code-Red Corsica) and drive wes to get the spare keys, while everyone else kept looking in Pat's front yard for the keys. We got the back-up, and I figured wes would go home cause he was pissed.  But he found them. So back to happiness again.  Then we went sledding, the first hill sucked, the second one was great. I kept going on kamikaze sledding missions after people raced, just to take em down. That was sweet. It was all good, then nick got pissed and decided to fight with justin, in the process of doing this, nick took off about half of the layers he was wearing, leaving him wet and cold after the pseudo-fight that ensued. Props to matt for starting the circle of death too, very ninja-like.  We were kinda done sledding after the "fight", so we went to kentaco for some code red and popcorn chicken. It was wicked. Until nick came in with just boxers on, that was kinda gross. Let's just say I'm happy he wasn't in my viewing range, b/c apparently the cold weather made things rather apparent.   Haley really has some surprising guy capacity. I mean, she sat through the baribalds talking about beating off and nick's episode and all the rest with a cool head. She's a cool girl.  Matt kept laughing at all the jokes, which was nice.  Sean just was goofy.  Pat was, well, he was Pat, and nothing is better than pat.  Jordan was weird, awkward, and immature. Why does he exist?  I had a great time, we played pogs. It was sweet.   Now I have to get some APUSH done so I don't have to do it during the week.

      Yes. Break is over tomorrow, I know. It is sad. The vacation Chris will go back into hibernation.  On a positive note, we're getting snow, which means that I can build a snowman, or spin out in the car. I'm also 50% done with the bridge, which is encouraging, considering it's due on Friday. On a related note, I'm nearing completion of the APUSH homework. Yes, this is what I have to look forward to now, homework. Very sad, very sad.  I bought a Def Juxx dvd today entitled "revenge of the robots". Unbelievable lyrics, very cool videos. Why does eminem sell records? These guys are better lyricists, with better vocabularies and beats. It's too good. I'd encourage you to check any of the artists from the label out. www.def.jux.net  I think that's it anyways. Go there, it's great hip hop.  Tomorrow finds me another combo rehearsal. Maybe this time we'll play more than just "Hava Nagila" but we jam the shit out of that motherfucker. We'll be playing Summertime, Hava Nagila, and Cantaloupe Island for the gig. Should be tons of fun, my soloing's gotten much better. Within the year, I'll be 200times better than before. I bet you this.  I'm kinda not really tired right now, I think I might actually...no...I won't. No writing tonight, or at least not any that I plan, though I'm kinda primed right now for some depth.

      I watched gangs of new york today. It was good. Many levels of parallel structures. If you watch it, you'll see all of them, Scorcesee makes it very very clear. Just figured I'd say that.  Last two days of vacation, and that's not cool. I have a lot of work to do. Especially the appeal, but I really don't care about that anymore. I mean, we won the goddamn trial, there's no reason why we should appeal.   The bridge is...uh...not going to take so long, I just hope I have enough wood. If I don't...it's not gonna be too fun. I'm really tired right now, that's enough of a blog update I suppose.

      Here I go....  Why is the New Year a huge deal?  At the end of every year, the same thing happens. There are parties, resolutions, and most importantly reflections on a personal level. All are attempts at taking advantage of the supposed "clean slate" that the New Year provides, even though January 1st is just like any other day. Why exactly people plan and chart their goals for the next 12 months may seem silly (why not start anew in May or June), but it is a necessary part of the New Year's tradition.   This tradition of starting anew reflects our interest in changing perspective, and trying to figure out what a year in our life means. We make resolutions and other goals to attempt to break down our mental/social barriers and see things from a different perspective, so that we may learn more about the type of life we lead and the type of world we live in. At the end of each year, we notice that we still know very little. After 11 months of trying to figure it all out, we cap off the year with a holiday that makes us think more about the significance of our mortality (Christmas). This in turn leads us to a short period of reflection that we suppress with holiday shopping, football, partying, and the like.   By setting resolutions, we attempt to find a new actuality for the coming year. We attempt to see through our own perspective by uniting in celebration on one day, and greeting a clean slate with hope. This is why we celebrate the New Year as such. It is a hopeful holiday where we might find a new meaning for our new year, and learn more about why we are given this chance year after year to clean up and sort things out individually and universally.  However, it comes full circle within 24 hours. New Years Day comes, and it is a disappointment. All the problems are not over, we do not have a renewed chance, it is all the same. So we isolate ourselves within our collective coccoons of personal perception and individual actuality for another 11 months, until we can come together again for the last month of the year, and hope that we do not do the same the next.  As a species, we are governed by many cycles, which come as a consequence to the way empiricism governs our reasoning, and to the way we live within our respective cycles. It is only at the time where we see that we are going around in circles that we may make peace with the force that confines us into it (ourselves), and greet the new cycle with new perspective and a new individual actuality. Hence, every New Year's Eve, Dick Clark on the television, it is the beginning of an individual revolution for the entire world. Do you choose to take part?

      Great night, plenty of caffeine (my drug of choice), I'm taping loveline, it's all good. My solo today blew, it was so bad, but oh well, it's not like it matters for anything.   Did I mention that Chappelle's Show is the best thing on television right now? Yes, I, in fact, just did. Three commas in a sentence, I'm losing my mind!!! Weeeeeeeee!!!! It's full of so many good sketches, tonight's was the Lil' John thing, the Rick James sketch a coupla weeks ago was great. Dave Chappelle has got to be one of the more underrated comics around.  Hanging out with Wes was great. We read over our opponent's appeal, and it blows. It's really awful, and we thought ours was unprofessional, this was just god awful. So there was a nice ego boost there.  I'm obsessed with the idea of going to university of chicago, it sounds like such a great place.  Speaking of which, I thought of a great question: If you could build a robot, would you give it the ability to have emotion?

      Went to the minkus show last night on a wimb. Pat drove me along with Matt and Jason, so needless to say it was a very entertaining car ride. Stupid Wheaton Grand is like 30 mins away, and we ended up waiting forever until minkus took the stage at 11:30. By that time, the entire crowd was gone, so not a whole lot of crowd energy, but it really didn't matter, it was probably the best minkus show I've been to. Pat said they didn't think that they played as well as they rehearsed, but I honestly don't know how they could complain after such a stellar show.  Their music is very very good, I'm surprised they haven't made the big time yet, they're just so good. It starts off simple, and branches out into countermelodies and Billy wailing w/ crazy guitar effects, and then eventually it gets pulled right back in with four part harmony, crescendo and decrescendo to extremes, you know the rest. Add in Matt and Lucas on the drums (two best highschool drummers in all of Illinois), and it's amazing. It's like a rock symphony because the caliber of music is so high. Reminds me of Sigur Ros and Godspeed blended together. Plus, Chase's vocals have gotten progressively better, so even though he doesn't sing a lot, when he does it blends really well. At one point I couldn't tell if chase was singing, or if Billy was playing the melody on his guitar. Wow, okay enough gushing.  We wandered around downtown Wheaton for awhile, it's like downtown Naperville, but not as nice. More classy restaurants, but overall it feels like a 30 time warp. I didn't have my jacket on when we were wandering the  first time, and with having the flu, I felt like absolute shit the rest of the night, and my chest still hurts. Pat and I eventually went to Starbucks after we lost track of the other people.   So we're sitting in Starbucks, and there's a (I'm assuming based on the smell) hobo sitting next to us with his hood up listening to a stack of 20 or so Michael Jackson cassette tapes. Weird, eh?   I'm rather happy I missed school during an off-week. Not so much hw, except according to yanisch, calc is getting a lot tougher, which is bad news for ALL OF US because calc is freaking impossible. Still though, I enjoy the class and I wish the other people would give yan some respect, they're really awful in class.  I'm going to absolutely bomb my solo on friday. I've barely practiced it, this is not good at all. I wish I could just not do it  now b/c I've lost a week's worth of practice due to flu. I'll attempt it today.  Hungry. Bye.

      So it's my third day of the flu, I feel somewhat better. The fever has decreased, but the body aches have stayed the same, plus my mind is really shotty. I'm going to have a little bit of stuff to make up over the weekend, but it's doable, so no matter. I'll be staying in anyways b/c of the flu, though I'll probably go to the minkus show tonight, yes, that will be nice. Bye.

      Ah, another fun-filled weekend. Saw along came polly with don last night, good kid that don, I worry sometimes about him, but then again, he's don, he'll manage. Good friend though, it's nice to stay in touch after all these years.  Along came polly was hysterical, best comedy I've seen yet in 2004. Ice cream later on was good too.  I love driving the new altima, it's amazing. I set the cd player to increase the volume as I speed up, it's sooo amazing. Ok, that's all.

      Yeah, took meg to the movies, saw "master and commander". Got lost on the way to the theater, that was a fun time. I feel bad though cause I know her knee (injured) was bothering her the whole time, and I wasn't sure if I was being too vocal in the car, she didn't say too much. But oh well, I can only hope she thought it was a nice time. Given that she's just a friend, there really aren't any repurcussions if she didn't, so I guess I'm in the clear.  I have a whole lotta stuff to do this weekend, I'm not even kidding. It's not going to be fun. Toe is hurting, manual surgery time.  So I had a great conversation with don about my earlier statment about how looks is just about everything. He pointed out to me that it isn't really, it just gets your foot in the door, personality is the kicker.  I have to work on both, more physical of course, cause that's the hook. Obviously my personality just can't cut it with anyone, but that's not going to change. Yes, I know it's terribly superficial, but people are naturally superficial, so it's a realistic thought.  Ugh. Not fun tonight, not fun at all. Bye.

      Tomorrow I'm off to the east coast with the band. Stops in gettysburg, penn state, DC, williamsbug, you know, everywhere. The bus ride will be long, but bitchin'! Aside from the fact that I have 2 books to read, a chapter in my APUSH book, and 3 AP calc tests to do, I'll find the time, and it won't be that big of a deal. Auditions went decently yesterday, I can't complain. That's in the past now, so I'll be focusing on reauditions if it comes to that.  We're reading "To The Lighthouse" right now. It's amazing. It's amazing because though it's a somewhat feminist novel, it's not overly feminist, and my teacher is not a feminist. He's a guy. So it works out. The thing that is so captivating is that in Woolf's stream of consciousness style, she's able to delve into the circumstances of relationships between various types of people. She probes into this grey area nicely. Unlike the romantics or transcendentalists, she conveys a strong sense of the divinity inherrent in that which is felt to be beautiful. Beauty is truth, truth beauty. That is all you should know or ever know, right mr. keats? Really though, it's the relation between people and that of people and the environment that gives us some hope of a semblence of order among it all. It's there, a shadow in Plato's cave. Amazing though. Exhilirating. We don't know what's happening, but we know that something is, and it's good sometimes.   I can't clearly articulate this right now because I haven't given it much thought. Maybe later I'll post a nice little philosophical blurb on the blog.   Lifting is going well. My goal is to be a complete beast by July. I think it can be done. I'm halfway there already.  The Muted Post Horn was received well by everyone who read it. I'm happy for that.  Intrigue is the root of love, beauty the root of intrigue, and truth the root of beauty. Beauty is not lust, love is not lust, truth is not lust. That is all you ever need to know.

      Been awhile since I've updated this silly thing...so I guess here's the rundown of it all...  Turnabout was a lot of fun. It was in fact, better than homecoming, but given that I spent homecoming on crutches, anything beats homecoming.  Took a trip to springfield with Youth and Gov't last weekend, Wes and I won 2nd place for our oral argument before the appellate court. It was nice. Two nights in a really nice hotel, and yes, mandatory fun night. Nothing like watching hot southern illinois chicks grinding on eachother. I wish I had a camera, it was just too good to be true. But, the attorney simulation was rather accurate, meaning we got about 7 hours of sleep over 2 nights. So now of course, I'm a complete zombie.   I'm royally screwed in math. no possibility of getting above a c, but oh well. I'm not a math person, I distrust numbers.  Auditions are this week, and I'm kind of ambivalent. I hope/think I'll make it into the top band, but you never know... I don't know whether to look forward to the end of this week or not. I'm going on that civil war tour for spring break, but I'm dreading auditions. not cool.  Right now everything is going waaay too fast. It's the homestretch of the year, so it's relentless. Speaking of which, March sucks, and February is the second worst. Worst and most boring blog ever, eh?  I'm looking for a job.   I'm considering applying to the naval academy. I probably won't. UC is tops.  Nothing like apathy toward the women-folk. I've given up this year, it's worthless. I'll just concentrate my efforts on getting stronger and in better shape, maybe that will work. Wait, no definitely that will work, who am I kidding?  Turnabout pics turned out shitty, oh well.  Bye.

      Night 2. weeeeeee. It was fun, especially the intermission when we jammed out on "Oye Como Va" and "heart and soul" just by ear. Way too funny. Dave drew a dirty picture too, that was funny only because he drew it. His mind works like that.  Tomorrow I go rock climbing w/ lauren. Should be fun, I enjoy rock climbing. I screwed up my hand today during golf though, so I'll have to climb through the pain.  AP tests next week. Am I concerned? Nope. I'll do just fine.

      ACT Today. echkgkghasvn. I don't think I did too badly, but not as well as I hoped. No matter though, I'm taking it again. Chase has a dinosaur named Benjamin, it's funny like that.  West Side blows. Absolutely is awful. the strings suck, no one has any energy, and the goddamn fire alarm went off during the dress rehearsal. Unbelieveable.  PSAE tomorrow.

      130 pushups and counting today. Not all at once, i'm not that beastly. How wonderful though...  I have a sinus infection, it's not fun. Hell week begins tomorrow, should be fun kind of...I work best under pressure. Coffee/smoothie with lauren was nice today, I enjoy talking with her.  Too much caffeine courtesy of Jeff Barnes' pepsi motherlode. And now I have a headache, this is not good...  I left my kettlebell at school, maybe I'll remember to bring it home tomorrow. I enjoy it very much, but I still think I'll need a gym membership come summer just to keep things up. Maybe I won't...we'll see. I'll probably just go to the forest preserve early in the mornings and do some hardcore stuff with it, that will be fun.  I'll start studying for shit this week. ACT studying first, and then throw in some APUSH. Calc I'll reserve for a later date, I feel confident about it, and that score really doesn't matter too much to me anyways.  I got a haircut. Kind of. The girl that did it was incredibly hot, but it's weird now, people that I find visually attractive I just don't feel the same about as I used to. That's a very good thing. It's deeper now, which is nice, I'm ready for college.  I think i might start writing a book over the summer. To pretencious? Who gives a shit. Not to mention finish my philosophy. Maybe i'll intertwine the two into a nice novel about nothing ala Ulysses. That would be good fun, now. Wonderful how it is to separate body and mind, it's a new talent that I have, or so it feels. Just gaze off and sweep over with numbness, it's good for contemplation and writing. My fingers just move as they should along the keyboard without any major though. This is why Joyce liked stream of consciousness, it's earthy and whole.  Whew. Green tea is my friend. Bye.

      The midday nap is my friend today.   Things couldn't be better, honestly. I have a lot of stuff to study for and do, but really, think about it, no need to complain ever. I'm in the middle of doing a whole week's worth of physics in one night, wish me luck. Hopefully I'll have enough done by tonight hw wise that I can get cracking on some AP and ACT study.   It's raining out, wonderful, I'll sleep well tonight. That's all for now.

      CRUNCH TIME BITCH!!!  Yeah, I need to start studying....a lot. I'll do physics and then hit the books, I really wish no other classes existed right now except APUSH and Calc, I just don't really feel like doing all that work, I'd rather go over stuff I know already. That would be very nice indeed.  Starting the running business in the morning. If you feel like saying "Hi," come to Delasalle Rd. and cheer me on. Thank you loyal readers. Life could be a dream...  I brought my kettlebell to APF today. Got some good feedback on it, it humbled many a beast in the class. I need to start using them more to get a more ripped look for my arms at least. The running should take care of the rest. Oh how vain I have become. It's really a shame.  FUCK FUCK FUCK. ACT next week too. It never ends, does it? Oh well, I'm taking it twice so yeah...  Musical hell week next week. West Side Story. It's okay I guess, some of the lead parts are still waaaay to shaky, but that's why I'm in the pit. I can do my part and just blame the actors for not singing correctly. In fact, that's what I will do.  We need to put out another post horn. Bye.

      I'm thinking more about the academy. Fuck, tomorrow is the practice math ap test, taken for a grade, fuck fuck fuck. Terrible. I'll have to study or review or something...I don't know, I've just been doing practice tests and doing decently on them...ERGH. This blows. And the prom anxiety thing just adds to it. Oh well.

      Yeah, so the naval academy is climbing the charts. Just seems soooo cool. We'll see how things play out in the summer.   I'm asking lauren to prom, wish me luck, I just need to find a way to get into her locker before she shows up monday morning. lol. Or of course I could do it during the day when I have option...hmm...yeah...  Wow, 4 years undergrad and then active duty. Very cool. Serve my country, make some money, and get a free education. I don't know how much better it could get. But if it interferes with my plans of getting involved in law or government, I'm not going. I'll be sure to ask the professors there what routes out of the academy are available.  If I do go on active duty... I'd probably join up with the marines...as an officer. Oh yeah, imagine me as an officer. I can see it now.  OK, enough crazy speculation for one night.  Hope lauren says yes, that'd make my "end of the year."  Hopefully I won't get turned down, lauren's a cool girl.

      Prom's coming up, and guess who's not going? That's right, it's me. I don't have anyone to ask anyways, or at least anyone I'd have a chance with, so that's where I stand. Go ahead, call me a pussy. I've made my fair share of first moves this year, so I've had enough.   SO i'll just concentrate on AP exams and the musical and pretend that prom will never happen.  LALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALA  Condolences to the Vasich family, from what I've read, they had one helluva son. Keep them in your thoughts.

      Bad news day.  Had to get an extension on my calc stuff, couldn't finish it in time. So, really, I have no respect in that class anymore  In class Essay today, not too fun  DIDN'T MAKE WIND ENSEMBLE. WHAT THE FUCK?! I got beat out by two freshmen. It's easy to see that they don't want to have an entire section of seniors next year that will end up graduating, still, it's awful, and I hate all of you.  This is the week from hell. Pit every day, lots of HW, I'm wiped out. That's enough for now.

      I have an idea for a screenplay, it's called "The Rules of Interaction." There's a plot behind it all, I have to figure that out, though. Mainly, I'm going to play off of the various ways in which people communicate and how we behave differently around others by instinct rather than choice. Or maybe the other way around. Either way, it's something to do.  My family is coming over soon to celebrate the dual birthdays, so that should be fun. Hopefully it won't be too late of a night, I have physics to do, and I have to finish a coupla things for the post horn and do research on the gay marriage issue for APUSH.   All this is easy to do.

      I watched "Donnie Darko" finally, I guess. I thought it was a really good movie, once I understood it, which took a ton of thinking about it and some research on the web. Yes, I'm a nerd. But really, it's a creepy movie, well made though. I think it's funny that after people watch that they get this silly artistic inspiration and immediately think they're amazing.   Going to battle of the bands with meg today, weather permitting. If not, we could just hang out as always. We have fun, I'm glad our relationship isn't one dimensional. I stayed up till 5am talking with her last night, time flew. It didn't even feel like 5am until my mom walked down the stairs and I had to feign being asleep to save myself from certain embarrassment/trouble. Yeah, I'm very much happy right now.  The weather sucks, I'm pseudo-bored. Maybe I'll do my crazy physics homework on the theory of relativity. Very interesting stuff, I must say.

      My friend nick and I were discussing hell. I don't believe in a hell. He does. This is what he said, it's quite funny.   I've started beliveing in two hells one red, where every thing cool happens-virgen sacrifices, thrashmetal- and white hell, where instead of a goat, the devel is a raven and he just caws. and you dont do any thing. you're trapped, and its eternal death. it's like when in egypt they weigh your heart against the feather of love right? and if it doesnt mesure up, set will jump up and eat it. that's white hell. it sucks. red hell is where murderors and lawers and episcopailiens go, white hell is where hitler and docter phil go, get what im saying?  i havent even started talking about purgatory. purgetory is a mountain and a twelve step program. it's a mountain on an island.

      Went to six flags yesterday for a physics field trip, and boy did it suck. It was pouring rain for the longest time and after that, a nice cold front swept through and froze my already soaking wet feet and chest. It was NOT fun. The hw packet that they assigned to us was thoroughly bs'ed by me and several of my associates. We were miserable.   But the rain didn't last forever, and Pat Chase and I eventually went on The Viper, Superman, Batman, Iron Wolf, and Raging Bull. Iron wolf was by far the worst rollercoaster I've ever been on, it was just very terrible. So we all took our required measurements and trodded on.   The fun didn't last forever. The buses came very late and Kennedy was about to kill things. We stood out in the cold for a long time, and the bus I was riding back on was the last one to show up. We spent a brief period of time buddying up with other buses to stay warm until our bus came, and thankfully, it eventually did.  We got back at 8:30.  So I get home, and truth be told, Katie needs me to pick her and her friends up from the mall, which was not originally scheduled, so that kinda pissed me off. I showered and then picked her up, and had to call Meg and explain to her why I'd be late picking her up to watch Pirates of the Carribean. We ended up watching "Snatch" at my house instead...or not really watching it but talking while the movie was going.   Today I need a haircut, and to get my hammock. Ian and I are going to lifetime to get a membership. I have much to do this weekend and I didn't anticipate having to do anything, this isn't fun.

      This poem is amazing, don't call me a 14 year old girl. this is art, and it's by Dylan Thomas.   Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  Though wise men at their end know dark is right, Because their words had forked no lightning they Do not go gentle into that good night.  Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, Do not go gentle into that good night.  Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  And you, my father, there on the sad height, Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

      I really get myself nowhere thinking about girls, relationships, etc. I need to stop doing that, it just ends up getting frustrating.  It is hot as all hell in my house.  Today was the last jazz rehearsal. I'm really going to miss all of the seniors in jazz, especially because more of them are my friends than the juniors in jazz. Next year will be very strange without those guys around, I'll definitely visit them though.  Dave made a good point today. He said, "I might join the navy after two years of college if there's nothing left for me here." And that's the truth, man. If I don't have any relationships binding me down, I might just say "To hell with it" and go to serve the country at the USNA. I hope that I don't make the decision for that reason, but it certainly has been a motivating factor. I do the mental math:  USNA= good education, job after college, 5 years active duty, graduate school acceptance everywhere, service  I know I'd be happy at Duke or UNC or Uchicago, but I suppose we'll see.

      Today was a nice day. We're really not doing anything anymore in our classes, so it's just focused down to spanish physics and english. I'll tell you though, I'm not enjoying the whole spanish project thing, especially because I keep forgetting to bring home my binder and do the powerpoint. Oh well. I'll save that for tomorrow.  Outside of having no more hw, I have so much free time that I don't know what to do with it. I know that I spend way too much time on this blasted machine, I'll have to do some reading of some sort. We'll see I suppose. I need to get into a new routine, since my old one is now gone.

Ok, I'll elaborate later, time to go to school. Maybe I'll add something while I'm there.  Bye.

      Big Fish is the movie. Great movie.  Chicago was an absolute blast today, aside from Stacy and Lauren being kind of tired/ pissed at mike the majority of the day, but that's okay, i liked spending some time with lauren, even if it was just walking around. We went to the Shedd and navy pier. It was nice.  Drunk people on the train. Priceless. So funny.  Bye.

      Wow. Prom was amazing. Lauren definitely was the most beautiful girl there, and she danced with me, yay. Good times, small dance floor.  Stacy's date Mike was a total ass the entire time and pretty much ditched stacy to go make out w/ his ex who was also in our group. I felt bad, so I danced a few times w/ stacy just to keep her from crying too much. That's not good, crying at senior prom, mike's a jerk. Today we go to chicago.  yay.

      Things are fun now...  It's nice to hang out w/ meg, she's a cool gal and is quite fun to be around. Wish her mom wouldn't give her such a hard time, she's a good kid. Nothing like spending 4 hours on the phone saturday night, haha.  Prom is coming up, it'll be fun, I'm very sure. Lauren seems to be excited (hell, why shouldn't she be excited) to go, and that is very good. We'll have a good time. Hopefully we'll still see eachother outside of the classroom after prom, but I'm not one to be too hopefuly  AP Tests this week. I'm really not as concerned as I shouldn't be. I'm reviewing a bunch for APUSH and Calc, I'll be fine. Considering that last year I barely reviewed for Euro and pulled off a 5, and I've been reviewing for APUSH already, I'll get a 5, no question.   After AP's, oh it will be so sweet, especially after the math AP test. APUSH will be a good day because it's like this:  -Test -Meg's buying me lunch for my b-day -Prom  I mean, really. And then the next day: Navy Pier. It'll be sweet. This week is very intense for this reason, but I enjoy it.

      1 mile...NO SWEAT 2 miles...BETTER YET 3 miles...HAVING FUN 4 miles....JUST BEGUN 5 miles...GETTING TIRED 6 miles...BREATHING FIRE 7 miles...ALMOST DONE 8 miles...CHASE THE SUN  Yeah, all these academy cadences will never leave me. That was the best week of my life. Being pushed to the edge physically also pushed me to the edge mentally. I'm a firm believer in mind over matter now, there's nothing quite like separating your mind from your body when you're on pushup number 990 of the day and then you go and run 3 miles to the transport boats. For all the physical exercise that we did, the academy is a great place for learning too...so long as it's in a technical field. The other fields are...not so good. Poli Sci is a popular major, but yeah...not anywhere near the caliber of UOC. For this reason and the fact that I don't want my life to be miserable in the summer and year following the end of senior year of hs, I'm putting the USNA out of my "apply-to" pool.  On a side note, I'm reading Clinton's book, and it's pretty good so far. Pat and I agreed though, it's quite cheesy at parts. Bill will tell some story, like about him getting his ass kicked by a ram, and then he'll insert some Aesop-like wisdom toward the end and connect it to a later campaign. I think brilliant people are inadvertantly cheesy sometimes, just look at what pat does...it's so cheesy I just have to laugh.  I really don't want to report to Target for job training, but I'm doing it tomorrow. I'll just go in there and be like, "Hey, here I am, when do I start?" Hopefully they won't say, "Today" because monday is when meg comes back, and for that reason I'm happy. And if she wants nothing to do with me, there's a show to see con amigos. So I have plans, yay.  Why has my writing style deteriorated? I'm sad. But then again, it's only 9am. I wrote a short story by the way, maybe i'll post it. It's called "negative currency," make of it what you wish, I'm not telling anyone what it means because that ruins the fun...if it's good.

      Back from the academy, i'm sure as hell not going there for school. I don't feel like being miserable for 2 years of my life when i'm supposed to be having fun.  The PT was brutal (especially the 7 hour sea trials on wednesday), but fun nonetheless. My squad leader was cool, my squad members were cool, and we had a good platoon. There's way too much about the week to write down in this blog, so if you really want to hear details, call me if you know the number, I'll tell you.  One thing's for sure though: I'm not going there...ever. It's not a matter of if I'll be able to do it, it's a matter of if I want to do it. I don't want to do it, I'm not made for the military life. I can do the PT, do the drills, do the yelling, etc...but I can't give up my life and individuality in COLLEGE.  Hence I'm tired and sore and bruised, but I feel great. I got Clinton's book, started reading it, it's pretty good so far...I guess. Not too dry at least, Bill can certainly write.  I don't have much to do now. I don't really want to work at Target...but I suppose I have no choice if this siding thing doesn't work. The academy let me keep all the t-shirts and sweatsuits they gave me. YAY!  I got some aviator sunglasses there too, and a rugby jersey! Yay for buying things!

      Greetings from my dad's laptop. This has been my recent base of operations, mostly because my sis is on the iMac all the time, but whatever...  Today was boring as all hell, and it was too hot outside to do anything, and I had no transportation,ugh it sucked so much.  I got a BIG FREAKING packet of stuff from the naval academy today. I need to fill out all sorts of stuff to just apply to the school. But oh yeah, I'm applying. Just watch me get in.  This week will be amazing, despite the fact that meg is a couple hundred miles away. I plan on playing games, and watch me do it. Also, since she's gone, Pat and I are doing a trial run of the beard growing competition...much to our mothers' dismay. But it will be fun, and I will prevail.  I'm also prepping for the ACT now. I think i'll ace it. I plan on reading over the princeton book at least 3 times. If I'm gonna grade grub, I might as well do it on a college-entrance exam  Woohoo!!! School's over. I have no curfew, and a gym membership, and all the time in the world come July. I'm stoked. Let's list the summer goals while I'm energized:  -Become more beastly -Be able to improv decently in Jazz, aka learn improvisation -Transcribe all the clifford brown, lee morgan, and freddie hubbard solos that I own -Fill out all my college apps -Finish all the books that have been sitting on my shelf for the entire year -Play ultimate frisbee many times -Play softball many times -Grow a beard and win the competition -Get my IMEA audition down so that I can do it in my sleep -Get my embouchure fixed, range up to double C -Memorize/perfect my solo -Get my funk/DMB combo together and rehearse at least 3 times -Write down some good ideas -Not watch more that 3 hours of TV a week -Run 3 miles daily in July/August -Turn the trumpet section into a group of good contributers to the band -Visit meg in michigan

      SAT is done. ACT in one week. Will this end? Yes.  I've been writing down scattered ideas the entire day, for some reason I'm a little out of sorts...maybe it's because of the test, maybe because it's the end of the year, and maybe because I have many suppressed internal anxieties...but we'll ignore that last one, right?  I actually read today for 2 hours. It was great. I have so much to read, and now I have time to read it!! Yay!!! And no summer work for next school year, YAY!!  But, I need a job...badly  Anything to get me out of the house and put some money in my pocket. Not that I've been a spendthrift lately (well, not too much of one), but I like to have some "walking around money" as my grandfather says.  Ian and I are working out at lifetime every day minus weekends. It's great. I think I need to be a bit more encouraging with him though when I'm spotting him, so I came up with a few taglines:  "You suck" "Is that all you got Janice?"  Yeah, those are funny. But Ian is rather reserved, and I am too when I work out...it's a different zone, so I doubt that will happen. Both of us have a goal, and that is to become beastly by the end of the summer. I had a similar goal last summer, and it worked, so now this is just a continuation. Yay for nutrition and running and all of those things...!  I think tomorrow I'm going to make some calls and see if I can get a softball game or ultimate frisbee game going. I need something to occupy my time, and distract me from getting too lonesome when meg's busy. Yes, and she'll be gone most of the summer too. At least we'll still have telephones though...or at least most of the time they will be available...so the communication can continue, and that's the part I like the most.  Next saturday I begin the odyssey. Boy's State, which will be fun, especially since I'm going to run for office and don't have a clue what I'm going to say in my campaign speech, is after the ACT. When I get back from boy's state, i simply transfer the dob kit over to my other bag and leave for the naval academy the next day. I don't know what kind of PT there will be, but I don't think I'll be incapable of doing it, or rather, below average compared to my fellow pseudo-midshipmen.  Then I get home, and my summer starts. I'll see Fahrenheit 9/11 the day after I come home, and then I'll write some things down, and write to meg, and be happy in my hammock under the sky until it rains and mosquitoes come and I get west nile virus, and then I'll be sad until meg comes back.  That's all for now, I'm digging this spacey post.

      Many things this week: finals and SAT  I must do well on my physics and spanish finals.  I want to get a 1500 or higher on the SAT, that would be very nice, that would mean I wouldn't have to take it again.  Meg came over today, and we studied a bit for spanish. It's too bad it was raining out, she wanted to see the hammock. Things are rough for her now, but in a week or two it'll be all good again. I really hope she doesn't move back to Michigan, that would make me sad. But she needs to do what she needs to do, so I guess I have no power over it, I just hope she makes the right decision for her.  Anyways, this SAT stuff is driving me up a wall, and I want this year to be over already. I have much to do.

      Still feeling shitty. My temp has gone up to 104...yep, 104. Gross as hell when I woke up twice in the night, covered in sweat. So then I have to take a shower and sleep somewhere else, etc. it was terrible. My body aches terribly, especially my neck and back, and I'm coughing up gobs of brown. ICK!  Called the doc, and he gave me a cough medication to help me cough everything out, an antibiotic, and a cough suppressant with a shot of codeine in it to let me sleep. I feel so weak now, and it sucks. I have no motivation to do anything, but why should I? I'm rotating between watching TV and napping...I'm just so freakin out of it.   By the way, Clinton rocked my world last night with his speech. It made me feel all warm inside...or maybe that was the fever.  Anyways, I'm done.

      This is the fever talking.  Yes, I have a fever, and yes I am sick. And yes I attempted to call in sick to Menards, but they won't accept it without a doctor's note. When told that my doctor does not have office hours today, my manager replied with, "Then go to the emergency room."  For the flu? Waiting at least 3 hours just to get an unexcused absence? I think not. I do/did enough for that fucking hellhole.  I feel so grungy, even though I took a shower not long ago. It literally feels like I went to sleep again....oh wait, I did.   I miss my meghan. Damnit. I can't wait for venetian night, that's going to be a good day for us.  Enough.

      Oh, such a great night out with Pat, Matt, Sean, Justin, and Jason. And Jordan too.   Walking around downtown and trying to get chicks (well, not me, but the other guys) was very fun. Especially when they would come up to us, and Pat and Jordan would completely blow it. That was entertaining as hell.  So my sister has all her friends over for a sleepover. It's very noisy in my house. No matter, they're cool, not obnoxious at all.  I have to work in....10hrs? yeah. Oh well. i don't give a shit. I'll operate on 6 hours of sleep, I can do that for 5 hours. I'm going to have sooo much fun tomorrow at work. I'm just going to goof off and joke around with everyone. Oh yeah. Hell yeah.

      Goodness gracious, I am up late again. But that's okay, I'm keeping it real tomorrow, so no need to sleep too much.   But. On a side note. Not a very good one either.  I got grounded from the car for a week. Why? Let me tell ya:  So I'm sitting in my house, minding my own business, reading "mother night" by vonnegut, and my dad is home. Now, usually he's not home this early, but he finished fast today. So he gets home, and as per usual, looks for little things that are wrong so that he can bother the shit out of my sis and me. Literally, he'll nitpick everything. So he comes up to me and says, "Chris, you know, since it's summer, you should be making your bed and cleaning your room every day." So I say, "Okay," and go back to reading. It's not like I never make my bed, this is the first day of the week when I haven't. It's not like my room isn't clean either. It's clean, I keep things put away and keep laundry off the floor.   So i get home from "King Arthur" tonight, and my mom comes and informs me that I have been grounded from the car because my dad noticed that my bed wasn't made and supposedly told me to do it. "you should do ______" is not an ultimatum. But, no matter, I'm grounded for a freaking week.  And if I protest, I'll get the typical argument. "You do this all the timek, Chris, this isn't an isolated incident." Yes, okay, fine. Since you have known me my entire life, I'm sure you can tell that ever since I was 8 years old, I was destined for this punishment due to a long series of abuses and malpractices. What bullshit. Honestly, I do my share. I work, I get fucking 5's on my AP exams, I'm working on my eagle scout award, and I'm trying to have a summer. You're going to "ground me from the car" because of making the bed? and you're doing this for a week? during the summer? on first offense? BULLSHIT. My dad doesn't practice what he preaches, his areas are messes.   This is war.   Not only will they understand that banning me is impractical, but they will want to give me the privilege back before they lose their sanity. See, I work out every day. I paid a good amount for this gym membership. My gym is 20 mins away (at least). So, how will this work in the context of my mom's already busy day? It won't work, that's the thing. I will win.  My dad needs to constantly attempt to prove that he is above me because I'm better than him in every way. It's a dominance thing. But, when he has NOTHING to do, it really flares up and gets bad. When he's busy, he acts like a normal human being. I've had enough of this shit.  Add that to the background stress and I'm about to explode.  On a side note, I saw "King Arthur" with Don, good seeing him again. He's a good kid, it's nice seeing him and still keeping in touch. The movie wasn't that great though.  Okay. Tomorrow is a brand new day, for me to wage psychological warfare.

      Bo Tulaney Tulaney tiki tanga Matu matu ma'a'ta Abu abu ala way, hey!   That's the Fijian war chant. I love it, and you should learn to love it.  James Brown is the man by the way. I want to see his show. I want to see the cape. I want to see where it started. I don't want to be let down.  But, I've resolved to go crazy. Not in a bad way, or in a compulsive way, but just...insane. This meg thing is wearing on my mind, and I'll get it all out there, but I know that in the end, things will be fine. So, I'll do what I can, do what I want, and go crazy. The craziness will not involve her, per say, but only my crazy ideas and the matriculation of them. Sounds good, eh?  But see, if I wrote down some really good stuff...or typed it...I could paste it on my walls, with wallpaper paste, and it has the possibility of looking really cool.  What would be even better and not as self-absorbed is if I just had people write on the walls in one room of my imaginary house/apartment. Like this biker bar in Arizona called Greasewood Flat. But see, I'd make sure they had something brilliant to write.  With this blogger I can change time, or stop time. So what does that mean for you? I'm going to transcribe or find a score or convince lauff that we need to play "I love you more than you'll ever know" by Blood Sweat and Tears. It's soo great. I wish I had a good voice, because I'd sing this every night if I could. Cape or no cape, I'd do it.  As of now, I've run dry.

      Ever watched the late show when Paul Schaffer starts singing some bluesy song and then a celebrity comes out and puts a cape on him...a la James Brown? Well, it was a great segment, a really fucking great segment. It's gone now though, they did it 65 times. I loved it. Well, I found out what song they play and what Paul sings. It's a song by Blood, Sweat, and Tears called "I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know," and it's amazing. I bought it off of iTunes...it needs more screaming at the end. But yes, go get that now.  I was just remarking to a friend of mine (over the internet, interestingly enough) about my latest good idea. I want to find out my own personal nutritional data. You know, how many carbs, grams of protein, calories, etc, that are stored in my body. Then, I want to make a chart, like the ones you see on backs of food items, and put it on a shirt, and wear it from time to time. It would be a perfect way to judge me in the scope of the national food standards. I'd have a food pyramid graphic and everything!! how cool!! The only dilemma is: how many servings am I? Maybe I'll have to think in terms of dinosaur bites. I think 2.5 is a good number, we'll stick to that. Do I have to make different t-shirts for different animals that could possibly eat me? If I did, the most entertaining one would definitely be for a single-celled organism. It would be something like this:  Servings available: 80 billion Calories per serving: .000000000002 Grams of protein: .0000000000008988 g  etc...  Oh, to think of the many ways I can get eaten. Maybe I'll do what fast-food places do and post my stats raw and cooked. but it would be rather difficult to find out what my percentages are while I'm cooked...that could terminate this venture. Well, it's all very fun to think about now and then, I suppose.  I can guarantee on the label it would say something that the lawyers forced on the manufacturer such as: "May contain chunks of almonds or walnuts"  It would be more appropriate to say something like "May contain cancer" or "Might be tattooed" Those would only be applicable to human beings, of course. Really, cannibalism is not a viable option in today's agricultural industry, so many labels to print, so many lawyers to hire. Oh well. We can dream though.

      here's a short story....   Pack of gum for me, my mouth was getting to be a bit too dry. Winter weather feels good on the skin, but when I'm going through tubes of chapstick and packs of gum at the rate of five each per day, I realize that I truly do hate this season. Man behind the counter gave me 25 cents, and I'm walking home. The red is deep enough for me that it can handle itself. No need to worry about something that comes with no consequence.  Mr. Smith, shoveling his driveway as I open the front gate, doesn't like it, but then again he is very old. His attempts to convert as many strangers as possible with his large, wooden yard signs, newspaper ads, and tea circles are mere manifestations of his inability to deal with the times. Currency reversion is impossible now, we have more red than green, and thank goodness. Mr. Smith is too old to understand...  Sometimes, down by the docks, you can find a few relics of the last generation. 99-cent cheesburger advertisements, bulk-mail coupons, and dozens of rebate forms are strewn about down by the waterfront, muddied by the tides and ruined by the sea. It's the town haunt. Sickly merchant marines have infested the docks as of late, occupying empty shipping containers that were left behind once the blockade was initiated. There's no need to develop the area, it's already ruined. Tankers and frigates stopped landing about 12 years ago, but the ghostly ranks of the merchants have been swelling.  But, I can still buy things. That's what the old-timers forget: purchasing power comes from the producer. The antiques will whip out their purses at every opportunity, take out a card or two, and plead. They plead with everyone. They plead with me, and I shrug. I can wear my red uniform with dignity.

      Free Pizza Theory:  OK, so let's say you want a free pizza. If you go to a pizza place and ask for a free pizza, chances are slim that you'll get one, let's say 1 in 200. BUT, if you never ask, your chances are 0. So, rule number one is that by asking you can only gain, instead of not asking or pursuing, where you have nothing to gain.  Second part is this: in order to get that free pizza, you can do several things. You can get a job at the place, get to know the employees, show up right before closing time to ask for one of the pizzas that they'll throw away, etc. Point is: if you're focused enough on a goal, you'll eventually find a way to get what you want. It might take awhile, but it CAN be done and you'll have a greater chance.   So, the lesson is to not only go after what you want, but focus on getting it until you get it. If you do that, and remain dedicated, you'll be unstoppable.

      Okay, so UChicago released their crazy-ass essay questions today. Here's the one I've already started on:  In a book entitled The Mind’s I, by Douglas Hofstadter, philosopher Daniel C. Dennett posed the following problem: Suppose you are an astronaut stranded on Mars whose spaceship has broken down beyond repair. In your disabled craft there is a Teleclone Mark IV teleporter that can swiftly and painlessly dismantle your body, producing a molecule-by-molecule blueprint to be beamed to Earth. There, a Teleclone receiver stocked with the requisite atoms will produce, from the beamed instructions, you—complete with all your memories, thoughts, feelings, and opinions. If you activate the Teleclone Mark IV, which astronaut are you—the one dismantled on Mars or the one produced from a blueprint on Earth? Suppose further that an improved Teleclone Mark V is developed that can obtain its blueprint without destroying the original. Are you then two astronauts at once? If not, which one are you?  I've written about a page or so of just notes, it will turn into an essay. It's very fascinating, and I'm sad that not all colleges challenge the mind like Uchicago does with its application. Just goes to show how the other colleges are more concerned about standardized scores than actual creativity and deep-thinking. I'd love to answer this question, it's right up my alley. The other question I am considering is one involving inspiration from a novelty-sized food item from Sam's or Costco. I really need to go to this college. Here are some great song lyrics to read:  there was a time when i had nothing to explain oh, this mess i have made but then things got complicated my innocence has all but faded oh, this mess i have made  and i don't believe in god so i can't be saved all alone as i've learned to be in this mess i have made  all the untested virtue the things i said i'd never do least of all to you i know he's kind and true i know that he is good to you he'll never care for you more than i do  but i don't believe in love and i can't be changed all alone as i've learned to be in this mess i have made the same mistakes over and over again  there are rooms in this house that i don't open anymore dusty books of pictures on the floor that she will never see she'll never see that part of me i want to be for her what i could never be for you  but i don't believe in god so i can't be saved all alone as i've learned to be in this mess i have made  Not melodramatic, so shut your pieholes. It's a damn good song by the late and great Ben Folds Five. Shut off your KISSFM and listen to good music damnit!

      Work ourselves, fingers to the bone Suck the marrow, drain my soul Pay your dues, and your debts Pay your respects, everybody tells you You pay for what you get You pay for what you get  Everybody asks me how she's doin' Has she really lost her mind? I said, I couldn't tell you I've lost mine  Words, words, words, have you heard A bird in hand is much better than, Any number free to wander Fly away... Stay You pay for what you get You pay for what you get  Everybody asks me how she's doing Is she really all she says... Everybody asks me how she's doing Since she went away I said I couldn't tell you  I'm OK I'm OK (I'm OK)  Surprise, surprise You pay for what you get You pay for what you get  Everybody asks me how she's doing Has she really lost her... Everybody asks me how she's doing Since she went away I said I couldn't tell you  I'm OK I'm OK I'm OK (How are you?)

      Made some money yesterday working for Mr. Jeff Barnes...did some mulching. I love that type of manual labor, there's something noble about working in the open air with your hands. A kind of natural pleasure that arises from it, as if one is returned to his or her ancestoral roots, seeing as we all in some way come from families of laborers. That's something I respect about Jeff and Jip, though they have so much money, they value hard work and quality of work as much as any other person. Too much is said about business and not about the people that make the higher levels of economy possible: famers and artisans.   I had a job interview with Menard's today. The manager is a really nice lady, whom I'd love to work for, but she's making me jump through hoops to get a job that doesn't pay so well. I have to get 2 FREAKING LETTERS OF REC! What the hell? I'm going to target today, seeing if I can try my luck after not showing up for 2 weeks when I said I would...but whatever, I'll just tell them the truth: I've had work commitments at home that I couldn't get out of. Or...maybe that's kind of the truth. It's more the truth than a lie, and I'd rather secure a job at target and make 60 cents more per hour, than jump through freaking hoops to make 6.50 an hour at menards. I don't care if it's 10 mins closer.  Yep, set my goals though, goals that I will achieve: 1. Get totally freaking ripped by the end of september (at latest) 2. Solo well on blues changes 3. Finish Clinton's book, breakfast of champions, and brothers karamazov

      Things aren't so good, aren't so bad.  I think I've not ruled out the academy entirely. It would be sweet, I give it that.  Meg has to decide if she wants to move back to Michigan for her senior year or not, so she's kind of scattered. her decision is weighing really heavy on me too. I try to separate myself from it, but I can't..i just like her too damn much. I think she's going to move, and if she does, i'm not going to feel differently, though things will inadvertantly change. This really sucks, and i feel like a bastard for thinking of myself more than her and how the fact that she has to make this decision absolutely sucks. Such a selfish bastard I am.    It's like wes said, "You know what this whole thing is like? It's like you're on a plane that miraculously landed with only one wing, and then exploded just as it started taxying to the gate." Well put, wes, well put. It had me in stiches for a good while too, wes was on his A-game tonight...funniest.kid.alive.  The new dave matthews band songs are amazing. They remind me of Lillywhite sessions so much, it's like the creative flow hasn't been interrupted. My favorite song so far is Sugar Will, even though it's the most underdeveloped, it has such a great melody and beat to it that I can't help but love it.  I think I'll run tomorrow on 6 hours of sleep, I need to run, and pay better attention to nutrition than I did today. really, what the hell is wrong with me? It's so simple, yet I cheated today. Oh well, I used my cheat day, looks like that's all I have for the week. My legs hurt, still feels like something is wrong inside my shins and knees, but I've run 7 miles on them already, so it can't be soo bad...  Ugh, too much stress for summer, I'll try to keep it off my mind, but it just surfaces at nightime when nothing else is happening. I've prepared myself for the worst case scenario, cause that's what I expect. We'll see how I think/feel after she decides to move back. I might just be considering the academy that much more, stupid how that works.   I'd fly an F-18...or maybe a Cobra helicopter for the Marines.  Speaking of which, it's home renovation time, which means that my dad has gone into psycho crazy mode about everything and I need to get out of the house.  Fuck target, they pushed back the grand opening, I'm on the job hunt again. I just need another interview to ace.  We need to ban prescription drug commercials on television. What purpose do they serve other than to convince the hypochondriacs of America that they need the latest boner pill? I've had enough of them, really, I have. It's immoral that prescription drugs are advertised, it's the damn doctor's duty to prescribe, not television's. Stupid television.  Yay for jazz, jazz jazz jazz. That's what I'll do tomorrow. Start teaching myself how not to suck at jazz. Well, now i'm being a whiny little bitch, so that means it's time to go before I write anything more that's whiny. Bye bye.

      So today was good and bad.  Turns out that pain in my chest is very well a fractured rib that I broke while coughing my lungs out last week w/ pneumonia. Lovely. Silver lining is: I can't perform my job as carryout at Menards, so they're training me as a cashier...and since they're not ready for it...I don't have to work tomorrow and they let me off 4 hours early today.   Plus, my sister's hot friends all love me. How wonderful, lol.  I might take someone out soon, that would be nice. I'm very much over the meg thing now, and it feels good. I've left it now, and thank god. It feels like I've been released from my chains.  The broken rib thing means no lifting or PT...FUCK. That sucks. I have to wait 2 weeks to go back to intensity. This really sucks, it pushes back my progress.   breakfast club this morning, pretty fun. It might as well have been just me and stacy talking, because lauren didn't say much and ehsan didn't really know either one of them...I feel bad for draggin him along.  but yes, things are kind of looking up for me, considering that last week sucked.

      OK- so I found out what was wrong with the tivo....nothing.  It's the retarded phone service that my dad bought...he has a problem with staying with one phone plan for longer than 4 months, and it turns out that his latest endeavour is a bitch when it comes to TIVO service, so I'm going to have to call them today and get this all straightened out. Ugh, I hate when he does stupid things and I have to fix them.  I'm in a bad mood today. I think that the whole relationship thingy just left me with a sour taste in my mouth. I don't know if I can trust my instincts anymore, they've led me in the wrong direction all year with the exception of prom, which I did because I went against my instincts. One thing is for sure, I've got a lot of rage today.  Senior pictures tomorrow...whoopee...

      My new favorite summer song: Crazy-Easy - Dave Matthews Band. Here are some more lyrics.

      So I'm over her. So I'm over it. So it goes.  I finished "Mother Night" and it was a very good read. I love Vonnegut's work, he masterfully articulates all the uncertainty that surrounds even the most absurd life.  I'm reading "Cats Cradle" now, in addition to the clinton book. The clinton book is good, but you can only take so much clinton at one time. It's like eating a very rich chocolate cake, you have to take it slow, take small bites, and not eat too much or else you'll get sick. "Cat's Cradle" is about fate...kinda, while it at the same time follows a fatalist theology that was, as it claims, made up entirely. Bokononism, as it's called, is just a collection of lies that have the ability to resonate with very impoverished people, and hence make their lives better. The entire point of what I've read so far doesn't bash religion, it just sees it for what it is, and offers some truisms even in the face of its self-described falsity.  On a side note, I got a college app from Northwestern in the mail. I'm no so sure that I want to go to Northwestern. I'll have to do some more research. I think though that it is such a good school that anything I am to go into would be well covered over there. Honestly, I could care less about pre-professional crap, I'm a liberal arts guy. So maybe it's not for me, but most universities have good liberal arts colleges inside them. Honestly though, I'm not as anxious about this college thing as I should be, because I want to go into a major that U of I already is good at. Even if I get rejected from everywhere, I can still have a home at U of I, and still have a great life. Not such a bad deal.   I found a Dave Matthews song called "Dreamed I Killed God." It's a rarity, he's only played it a handful of times with Tim Reynolds, but the basic idea of the song is quite good. Here are the lyrics:  Dreamed I killed God  Woke up.   He lay there  In the pathway  Pleading,  Pleading,  Pleading,  Stop   And I dreamed I killed God  And woke up.   Dreamed we killed God  Woke up.   Oh we were praying all the while  For to be saved  While we stab his heart   Oh we were praying all the while  While we cut  Out his heart   Laying down,  Laying down there   Dreamed I killed God  And woke up   Plead that I will make it (in)   We’ll open, open the doorway  We leave the door open behind us now   Dreamed I killed God  And woke up   Divine  Divine surprise  That we have killed God  While I was sleeping   He was bleeding,  Pleading,  Please stop   We were too busy  Praying,  Praying for him  To save us all,  Save us all   When you leave life behind  Die,  Leave, You and me  When I leave,  When I leave life,  Reasons,  Reasons  We came  Oh we’ll see   [Mumbling]  Oh we will never know how  We could hide the bucket  God save you  Understand me  I don’t think he would teach you  To save your soul  (…)  I don’t think he would teach you  To save yourself  (…)   I woke up  Lay back  And woke up.   It's kind of a sad song, but you know...it's called "Dreamed I killed God," not exactly a jolly title. Still, I love it, and now it is mine for enjoyment, along with all the other lucky people that own a copy of one of the 9 times this was played.  I'm feeling surprisingly good today. I'm back on the horse. I'll still be meg's friend, that's what she'd like anyway. That's cool with me. She was, after all, the worst girlfriend anyone could ever ask for. Watch out naperville, I'm back on the prowl. Or...rather...back into my little corner of mediocrity. But things were worse than mediocre for a long time, so it's nice now. I will continue to lift, continue to run, continue to write, and hopefully someday it'll all pay off. I'm close to getting ripped, I can smell it. It will be done before the homecoming dance, I know that for sure. That's all for now.

      I loved the chick Would've done anything for her But she was a sore loser Kept me in suspense She'll probably wanna come back once I push the SL600 benz Thinking of her makes me cringe Rather have 100 needles pushed into me froma syringe I'm glad shes outta my life Anybody would be better as a wife I hope these memories fade away Because my love for her led me astray  -Ahmed Akhter  aka A-Trizzle aka Darkness  Tha man.
