      Will keep in mind (in mind!) this  urlLink link  when I draw up course websites this fall. The intro to lit class, especially, since they'll be the ones dealing with all things Matrix. Need to remember to get my hands on some books: interlibrary loans instead of amazon, I think. Though if they turn out to be red-pill popping good, I'll buy, I'll buy. (Is there any way out of the blue?)  Have developed a dramatic crush on Keanu Reeves. I like that he asked the brothers what to read while prepping for the Matrix trilogy and that he confessed to Hume and Nietzsche. He is quiet, chameleon, private. Keep on keeping on, KR. For Keeps.

      Lost this morning's entry. Clicked on preview and lost the whole damned thing. Now I know better, I guess.  Evening letter to P:   Well, I've discovered that I'm feeling reluctant to do journal work in the old way. Can't say why, exactly. I feel a little as if there isn't a good spot in the house to sit and write in my book, which seems a shame—it’s a  lovely cozy apartment—I’m lucky to have this place—but it’s true enough. Don't feel like sitting at the table or on the porch or on the couch or on the big chair by the window in the study. And I can't do it at the desk. That's where the computer is. All the little routines of my life have been perfectly disrupted since I moved here last year. Running was one of them, but journal writing is another. I’m not really so prolific, you know.  So. I started a blog yesterday thinking that I tend to do most of my writing on computer anyway. Big leap: I feel like a hypocrite. I tell my students not to compose poetry on a keyboard and I force them to keep handwritten journals, all because I believe that a hand with a pen in it is more selective about language than two hands tapping away. Now I’m considering the possibility of asking my fiction students in the fall to start blogging. I suppose it would be easy enough to skim through thirty blogs at the end of the term when I grade, and there’s something potentially exciting about being able to create links or to cut and paste text or photos—and to see one’s personal writing as directed at an audience even as one remains anonymous.  I’ve been very invested in requiring that my students keep a certain kind of artist’s journal, a thing filled with dreams, eavesdropping, personal reflections, drafts of stories or poems, drawings, paintings, collage… And I’m often frustrated with the results. They seem to have a hard time committing to it, even when I promise not to read anything private. They struggle to develop a relationship to the thing as if, because it’s assigned, they can’t take ownership of it. Now I’m wondering if, as an assignment meant to help them discover a place where writing is playful and personal, the journal fails inherently, inevitably, because it is after all an Assignment. And I wonder if maybe keeping a good old-fashioned common-place book is just not as appealing to people who grew up with computers as it once was to me. I do often use a little course website (nothing fancy—I’m not really computer literate—I use a site called “nicenet.org” which is free, no-frills, and beautifully user-friendly—know it?) for my literature courses so that the students can ask questions they may not have been able to ask in class, respond to one another, and post short papers for all to see. They get into it too. Sometimes it gets polemical, and some students are more verbose than others, but they seem to like checking in. I imagine they sit at their computers, email, surf the web, and stop by our virtual classroom just to avoid getting back to writing a paper or lab report.  You see? You ask me about teaching and receive a lot of pedagogical dribble. But maybe you have thoughts on this stuff?  I love teaching. I really do. But I can’t believe I’m sitting here thinking about things I’m going to change from last year’s syllabus—and how much work I might be in for to make the idea work. I sincerely believed that course prep would get easier and less consuming as I worked out the kinks in my syllabi, discovered texts that seem to work well, and developed exercises I like and want to keep. But it’s just not like that, is it? At least not for me. I have a very low threshold for boredom. I know, I know it well—I will make things hard on myself to avoid boredom. Some of the finest teachers I’ve had teach the same courses, give the same lectures, literally, they’ve been teaching and giving for years. And I know that’s how the courses became so damned good, and I know that continuity serves the student population, too, because every student who took, say, Professor Speer’s class has a mutual experience and THAT, friend, is community. But I’m beginning to see I’m not that kind of teacher. I’m just a bit too egocentric to teach stuff that isn’t also challenging me, keeping me on edge.  I don’t know. Maybe it doesn’t matter at all. I think I’m a good teacher. I have only two life skills. One is cleaning house. The other, which always comes as a surprise to me, is teaching. But who the hell knows what that means?  How do you know? I tend to think that only a few themes dominate in college learning. The most obvious, probably, is information—how much, how difficult, how comprehensive or profound, how cohesive, how rigorous—but probably more influential and less certain is enthusiasm—how translatable, how contagious, however inspiring. And that’s where I get stuck. I really do feel as if I can teach anything—even on the wing and unprepared—if I’m excited about it. And I usually lose my enthusiasm for texts once I’ve taught them.  A visiting professor here in the fall told me that professors are nothing more than performing monkeys. He meant it in a good way. Pull off a great performance, however you do it, and you’ve taught a great class. But my best performances are always spontaneous, always inspired by the unpredictable direction of a discussion rather than delivered as part of a prepared lecture. A well-prepared lecture is expedient, efficient, informative, and satisfying for those students who want to sponge up knowledge quickly rather than slog through the mess of figuring it out for themselves. Don’t blame them. I prefer to hear what someone else think first too. But I was always a passive learner, and listening, over speaking, hurt me as a thinker. Articulation is gutsy. If I was enthusiastic in those days, I was too scared to admit it in the classroom. I listened for grade contingencies and saved my best thinking and saying for papers. Listening well is an excellent skill, but most people don’t listen well. Most people listen dependently. I am a selfish teacher. I teach to learn. But at the same time, it pains me to think that any one of my students will walk out of my classroom with only my mysterious agenda in mind. My voice, my knowledge, my grading criteria. If they depend on me for their future lives—for their grades—then I’ve failed. Maybe what I’m trying to teach before anything else is the courage of independent thinking, despite the risks. I give out far too many A’s, but at the price of their freedom as well as mine.  Now what kind of idealist do think I am?  I’ll leave off here, though I haven’t responded to much of your note. I know Chamonix only from Romantic literature. Coleridge has a poem (not a very good one) about Chamonix. The Alps figure largely in Shelley and Wordsworth, so I have landscapes in mind from the poetry. Truth is, I’ve only been abroad once, and for one week, in London. Strange thing considering that my scholarship is entirely British—but just as involved with revolutionary France. Money is the first culprit, though I admit to feeling lost as a traveler, still. The first journey I made across the country was to Smith College, and that, not only alone, but not light. It was a debacle, let me say. These days, I travel more lightly and “get” the idea of meeting connecting flights and sitting through airport layovers, but for a long time I spent some embarrassing and terrifying moments in airports. I envy your insouciance, your familiarity with travel. Usually I go back to the southwest during breaks. But I do have this fantasy of spending a week or two on a hot white beach in Mexico. Cancun, for instance—where I have been once and loved despite and in support of the tourist traps—Cancun, where the beach is white and bare and the sea is as clear and warm as bath water.  You don’t tell me what makes you vulnerable. Tell me that…  Yours,  g.

      Insomnia: woke at 2 am from dreams that kept me alert all night and tossing in bed--dreams I can't remember now if I ever did--walked around the house in the dark thinking the alarm would go off at 4 am and I would be awake to hear it, more: exhausted by 7:30 in the morning. Drifted off around 4, snoozed through an hour of the buzzer, and at last gave up bed just before the light came up. I am certain the cat bit my ass in that time to get a rise from me, but I was fighting with morning. --Made tea, fed the cat, surfed the net for matrix philosophies, and before all could be lost, dressed for a run, took a load of laundry down to the basement, started it, then went out the door. Discovered today a house on Kellogg by the tracks has huge datura plants flowering in the yard. Moonflower moonflower. And this, where the trail along the tracks begins, too, if you can call it such a thing. Ran down towards Main, then a bit further along the tracks. Managed to run most of it and to be out for 5o minutes or so. Not bad for a smoker who hasn't used her legs this way for much of last year. Was shamed into it yesterday by an email from P who obviously runs and cycles great distances--I was talking about Neo kicking ass and P said I'll have to get running again if i'm to kick ass myself. Call it a kick in the ass. It worked, today, I guess. It helps to have found a trail along the tracks. Hope it goes further, as I can.
