      hahahah hrmm..sitting in class..where there is no teacher. why? cause Mr. Pratt got locked out by who? Me! hahahahaha..I'm serious. The class assembled together in the *secret room,* stacked tables & chairs against the door & eluded any chance of making eye contact with him. Oh boy, he was mad. hahahah 'twas worth it!   over it.  After another amusing chat with 'the boys,' I managed to grasp a handful of definitions which I had never even deemed to existant before. Oh did I learn quite a lot that lesson. And let me tell you, it wasn't about computers hahah. Apparently, there is quite alot of gossip circulating the school! Let's just say a girl from Barker has become rather renowned, especially amongst the boys! Where's the dignity there? And you know what else is circulating the school? Conjunctivitis! hahah..the whole music department has it, another 5 people were diagnosed today. It's obvious since they walk around with sunnies on. Hope I don't catch it! Can't afford to get it *wishful thinking*  -- feelin greeat! --

      Soul food.  At the moment, I'm listening to Rueben - I'm Sorry. He's such a big guy, in & out, big hearted, big voice & utterly talented no questions asked.     'I'm sorry for 2004. And I ain't gonna mess up no more. This year. I'm gonna take this one chance. And make it real clear.'      That perfectly illustrates how I feel & act with what's left of the year. To live this one opportunity to attain my designated providence, fulfill the dreams of I and those I care about, to fulfil my expectations, grasp my potential - Let go & Let God. No regrets. No hesitations, repunctations, buts nor ifs. No silent echoes of Brian Mckight's - Shoulda Coulda Woulda.      'Should've been a better man. Could've been better off if I had done right by you. Could've done this, should've done that, but I know I can't go back. But now it's just too late. I'm saying shoulda, coulda, woulda.'     So HSC, I promise to be faithful, to let Go & let God, to be righteous, to live by you, to stay true to you, to care, to maintain, to protect, to grasp my potential, to exert all efforts for you. My HSC - this I pledge to you - I do.  hehehehehe :D  -- head hurts pow* --

      Just realized.  Generally, I tend to be friends with outspoken-louder friends who overbear my personality, depending on which friendship circle. But when I try to 'emerge' & come out of my shell, step-up & make new friends, doesn't mean I am better than them nor have they ever been better than me. Doesn't mean I have less time for them, love them less nor give them less a less preferential status. Doesn't mean things have to change. Face it, things have -  In fact, it is because of them I am a stronger person. It is because of them I have been given the confidence to shine, share the gift of friendship - be happy & content. I love meeting people, trying to delve into discovering the 'christ' & charisma within them (even though it doesn't seem like it). Its true. I do. And oh have I been blessed my whole lifetime. This year I must say, have I been a witness to ever-changing friendships, new & old. Yet it sucks how I have the mentality that I may always have to endure my toes being treaded on, or giving way or letting them 'win' to avoid conflict. Or I have to restrain myself from saying or doing certain things - especially in the eyes of certain individuals. Im not being true to them, or to myself.        'You have equipped me well & blessed me with your gifts at the right moments in time & place. And for that I am utterly grateful. Help me understand why things have to change. It is for the better. I will be OK.'     -- feelin opps! -

      Just blogging for the sake of blogging.  One more. What happened today? nothing really. Juss slept for three glorious hours. I think I went to bed smiling. And now I am awake =) and loving the freedom of time. Its all over. Yet retaining such freedom has paralyzed the concept of knowing what to do - cause I dont know what to do. It always turns out like this - longing for everything to be over & now that it is, you are at a standstill & dumbfounded as ever. I'll juss take it slow & savour the moment. I miss pokemon. *sigh  -- feelin great! --

      I love that question. Why. It's what I ask whenever I do not know what to say or when I would rather shield my reaction. Oh i'll be blunt and say it's all I ever do ask. It is what life is about. It is what i plan to ask God when I meet Him (hahaha..awh GAT memory - buko babes ;D)  Talk about relief. I only have three to go. But today. My teacher approached me & said something to me. Actually I received news from three teachers. But this teacher..what He said was absolutely different?..I don't know. Don't get me wrong..it was a compliment. But I took it differently.  I really dont know. I really really don't know. This is what I was scared of. Everything going absolutely right. Putting my heart & soul into something..and even receiving positive feedback which in my opinion was genuine, or as least I hope so. But then..gah. It juss sucks! Its just so discouraging! And I don't know why Im so pessimistic (for the fact that what He said was a compliment). Maybe I am in denial. Maybe I'm only believing in what I what to think. oh shush.    And last night's thought was,   'How can you remain close to God when he seems so far away?'   THAT is really hard. But I have to trust & after all - it is His plan. And I do want to. I told you I was scared..of everything just taking a turning point. See I told you! haha oh dear.  Thank God for happy people! They are an absolute joy ;) Ian rang today even though it was his birthday - haha 'manual.' I also talked to an anonymous person today. Don't think she knows how gorgeous she is. Full of charisma, knowledge & talent. At such a little age. I ultimately have respect for you -   Happy birthday to Nikki, Jess & Ian :D  -- had better ;) --

      Only just have I been asked, are you ok. And the answer? I am. I am okai despite the mitigating circumstances which currently surround me. And it is at that notion, why I am in several ways, not ok. I am not okai for the fact that I am contemporaneously bearing staying up awake til 4am (5am last night, or should I say, morning), tolerating the treachery of the 5 or so it seems, immeasurable tasks anticipating to be accomplished. In actuality, I should be brooding, fretting, worrying, stressing, irritated, exasperated, livid & outraged. But I'm not. Im okai. Presumably, it seems as though I don't believe I am okai, as evident throughout the repeated phrase. But really I am. But should I not be okai for the fact that I am ok. And at that thought, it scares me.  The only concern I have at this moment is the fact that I have not seen nor heard from anyone in too long - and that my friends is a travesty. It is utterly enticing to drop, relax & do what any normal teenager would do - smoke. hahahaha only joking s'if I'd smoke ;) I'm asthmatic! As I was saying, it is not unusual for I to be home alone on weekends, even til 2am at times.   My family is constantly out with the CFC Community - yes! We got to love them. My brother surely does. He weeps at the thought of not attending a meeting at least once per week. Hence why I love my YFC Community. Hence why I miss everyone. It is a community where everyone brings out the best in everyone. It is where you can be yourself, be surrounded by people, meet people old & new. It is where you will eventually find best friends, if not - find friends you had lost contact in previous years. It is where positive vibes are definately & ultimately disseminated. It is where you learn, cherish, love & worship the Big man upstairs. It is where you are you. It is where I want to be. Juss missin everyone! that's all ;D  At least Ian's is on the weekend! If you are not there, you are not anywhere. hahaha.  -- missin you --

      Love is beautiful.  Yet all this colloquy on marriage is making me sick. Not long ago, was I utterly enthralled by the concept of marriage. It may be for the fact I wanted to get married – for the sake of wearing a dress. It may be for the fact that there faced in front of me a seamless opportunity to get married – perfect in all ways mentionable – the weather, the milieu  (Darling Harbour – who wouldn’t?). It may be for the fact that my infatuation was rather augmented by the debutante which was held the following day.   One issue.  No partner. Hahah s’if I’d get married now.   Marriage is consecrated. Marriage is more than a sacrament. Marriage is the Dignity & enriching of human love; a special relationship designed to weather all kinds of hardship. Marriage is a summation – a bringing together of two people, two families, two societies  rich in symbolism & expression. Marriage is a convenant between man, woman & God. Marriage is God's love.   'You gave man the constant help of woman so that man & woman should no longer be 2 but 1 flesh & you teach us that what you have united may never be divided. Father you have made the union of man & wife so holy a mystery, symbolizing the marriage of Christ & His church.'   But who exactly knows,  'Who the one for them is?'  I mean, who would know, that upon encountering that special somebody for the very first time, that one day they would marry them & share a life with them. What feeling? What emotion? What love? Is it really God's plan? Is he/she really the one? How can you tell?   Love.  Only deserves the best.  You.  Only deserve the best in love - God 's love.  Love yourself.   How can you love somebody before learning how to love yourself. Accept your faults, accept your traits, accept everything you are. They will love you for you. Not who you are because of them.   You know who you are.  -- feelin good ;) --

      I'm in no mood to type nor think nor bear anything nor anyone else. Or else ill *snap* This no-sleep no-sense nonsense has bothered I. And *gah! I just want to *zzZz* in my *ooh comfy *awh bed.  Seven beautiful hours later.  hii my beautiful friends!  You guessed right! I got some much sought sleep!   Now I'm feeling *ahh but still *ergh for the fact that my assessment count is still seven *sigh. I want to *vtschh. Nope *vroom. Nope changed my mind. Im so *brrr. Riddle Diddle Time. *hurrah!

Oh! seven *squeals* & three *cheers* for sleep! ooh* brrr. Opps *yawn. Opps *achoo. Opps *god bless you!   During these *fab-5 hours of sleep, I had a dream. I was in a mall somewhere. Where you could not walk anywhere. By getting around to shop, you had to swim everywhere. I did not know what to wear. You had to swim with Fish. These fish were out of the extraordinary. Weird looking creatures. *puke. Meanwhile, my good friend Monica squashed a fish. I saved it. I jumped in & saved it! Mind you, this fish or so it seems, bore a similar resemblence with a tadpole. I developed a friendship with it. Two hours later it died. I ended, by exclaiming,  'One day we will meet again Nemo.'     -- missin' inseperable times --

      To my amusement, Sam, James & I concocted a short but sweet soap opera during Legal Studies Class, the class wherein I have the most cases of fatal asthma attacks haha!  The Plot  After being brusquely snapped at, the emergence of Sam the sadistic character, who incessantly assults his wife, I, to the extremity that I undergo a prolonging degree of 'battered wife syndrome.' Yet with the involvement of a sweet, little child, James, the current stance is somewhat atypical than what it seems.  The Scenario  After much conflict, both internal & external, I am reduced to bestowing James to Child State Services. However, as insecure as I am, I decide to bear the violence & condemnation, the vehement Sam persists to inflict upon me.  The Question  Why so violent?   The Answer  I cheated on Sam...with Will Smith.  The Twist  Why is James still white?  The End.  hahahahahahah you like ;)? Wait til we introduce the personality of Andrews, who possesses a secret. That his dog only knows of. Hrmm  The complexitities of such soap operas! Intriguing indeed. hehehe =) Another glorious day! My assessment count has now been reduce to seven *cheers* And in response to your lovely posted comments, its delightful youre reading this =) And I will gladly keep you posted! But to end my delirious days..  You too japa*yuki are quite articulate! hahah FC! gah!  -- missin ashley ;) --

      Fatigue is attacking me. Powerfully.  Last night was a late one, I must admit. And after reading   'The Purpose Driven Life'   I happily slid into a deep, tranquil sleep. Lately, I've had the curse of unexpectedly waking up during the sound, uncanny night. It hasn't dawned upon me until now, that I may be suffering from fatigue. And the consequences it has inflicted upon me! My oh my. A loss of appetite & persisting lethargic effects. *Sigh* I just simply want to kick into my old routine. None of this two hour deep sleeps.  Nicole & Nell are leaving tomorrow =( I'm merely saddened by the thought of not witnessing the flourishing of these beautiful girls! But I know that God will continue to protect His children & bless them eternally. So with that thought placed peacefully in my mind, I am happy that they will too be happy, healthy & safe.  Hume let me borrow the   'Queer Eye for the Straight Guy'    novel which is rather intriguing. The context as a whole is somewhat satirical. But you have got to love them! Hahaha the peculiar concept of tzussing in particular, is worth a read! I have most certainly accomplished two weeks worth of high school education in just one day - today! It's getting tough. Real tough.  One down Eight to go!  Oh. To my surprise someone unexpected called me today! Oh boy I missed them.  Oh! gah! that boy. Is so queer! You know what Im talking about bus bay babe ;) hahahaha omg! To even think..opps *unspoken forest*..haha  By the way, I extend my appreciation & gratitude to those individuals who insist on perusing such drivel..that's raetarded for you  =) hehehe. You know who you are! Haha!  -- feeling *gah* --

      I think I'm doing rather well, with the eight assessments & all. My stress level hasn't been all that bad, in fact, I'm rather high-sprited. After all, with the HSC being the prevalent hindrance behind my social life, I have the tendancy to forget it is merely a blessing in disguise. If employed well, my current goals & aspirations will be accomplished!  Ever think about the blessings God showers us? That we happen to overlook nor barely acknowledge it as we, ourselves are dwelling in the past, remorse or emotion. I myself am reduced to such prolonging. But Saturday Night impelled me to look around & count my blessings. And let me tell you - I am blessed. It never occured to me that a living in Australia was a blessing. Being the radiant country she is, Australia is considered one of the finest, amongst the OECD countries. Its GDP is increasing, imrpoving the economic forecasts of prosperity & welfare of the nation. Its home to so many beautiful people, people who have evidently bequeathed footprints in my life. Whether they were there at that one moment, whether they are about to embark into my life or whether they have been here from day one, God equipped me at that moment with that special individual. And let me tell you, He has equipped me well!  I warned you I may acquire the power to draw you into pondering! hehehe! But I formidably invite you to count your blessings.  Patricia! I love you to bits! But toothpaste? Come off it. Whatever you're on. hahaha. Coleen came over today =) She didn't have the energy to walk home, which in reality is 5 houses away so her father picked her up hahah. I wouldn't blame her. I myself know what playing soccer can do. Last year I was captain. Last year I was goalie. And let's leave it at that hahahah you know what I mean.  Oh dear. smiles =)  -- feeling drive --

      If I could, I wouldn't change a thing.   Last night was surely a night of endless memories. Memories of which I now hold dearly close to my heart. Throughout the past few days, the thought of enduring another karaoke family party hovered in & out of my raetared mind. Let's see why, shall we? The cleaning, the cooking, the procastination of the completion of assignments - what to do?   Oh dear.   Yet surprisingly enough. It wasn't bad after all. In fact, as suggested by the title of this blog, it was virtually perfect. The day commenced slowly, I must admit though. With the arrival of my grandmother, cousins, uncle (poor thing ran over his own foot with the forklift), I equipped myself for a really long (literally long for nobody goes home til about 3am) night. Not until my older cousins arrived, as well as the rest of the family did the gathering seem complete.  A joint celebration.  This gathering was a farewell for Tita Gigi, Tito Noel, & their two gorgeous daughters Nell & Nicole. Where are they going? Let's just say bad things happen to good pepole. It was also the girls' birthday. Not to mention Ate Marriz's 24th, my parent's 18th wedding anniversary & Lolo Pael's 80th or so birthday. And that's when it hit me. No matter what mischief the younger boys were up to, no matter what each mother was frantically attempting to cook, clean or take after their little ones, no matter what the men were roguishly doing - everyone stopped amid all the commotion & noises, to watch this fragile, old man blow out his candles. It's as if amongst the activities around me didn't bother me, nor did my current worries or doubts. It's as if a still shot was taken, encapsulating the beauty of that old man celebrating his birthday. And there was something rather exquisite of that epitome. The fact that he was blessed with 80 years of life & accomplished so many things within his lifetime. He was blessed with a life, a wife, a family - love. My only prayer is that everyone will be as blessed as he was; the divinity of 80 years of life & love.   Favourite moments.  From that moment onwards, I didn't care so much about anything else. I was utterly content to have these people around me. Throughout the night, other precious moments of still-shots were stolen. For instance, as Chen,Cha, Lester & Dean were teaching everyone else how to attempt their hands at poker, my grandma requested if she could play. And don't let her fragile, old body deceive you. As per usual, the game was won loud & proud. Not by the 'teachers' of the game, but by my grandma - pulling out her tricks of the trade! After a game of 'Lola-Charing's Poker,' a game I invented was played. The parents had to however, interrupt the game a few times, as they had their own little disco going on - with the salsa, ocho ocho, nutbush & that no-sense song 'I said a hey hah!' It was so. What's the word. Delightful. hehe! Chen being the smart little girl she is, won the game we were playing (like scattegories). The night was finished off with a little karaoke & a mini-disco in the formal lounge room for my brother, Ate Joi, Ley & Lester. My uncle (the pioneer) trying to crypt walk! hahah! interestingly peculiar..  I also had the chance to catch up with Gerry in the morning. hehehe dont worry too much darling! I'll pray for you =) And a surprise call from Ryan (best friend!) & a short but sweet conversation with Mush also contributed to the remarkable day I had! Being happy is selfishly sweet. But ensuring that everyone else is happy around you is even sweeter ;)  Isn't it funny how I influenced two friends of mine to analyze the depth of their dreams or the lack thereof. Isn't it funny how I influenced another two friends to update their blogs. Isn't it funny how I managed to manipulate another two friends to start a blog. I've got the power! hurrah! I Love all of you!  -- feeling blissfull *awwh* --

      Dreams.  Speaking of dreams, Nick being the character he is brought up a totally no-sense conversation today concerning Julian, a rather tall student in our class. Julian, being renowned for his extreme height, was paid thirteen grand to act as one of Chewbacca's Rookies on Star Wars III, alongside Natalie Portman (hahah excuse the marketing). Thirteen grand for blowing up a tank, not one line regurtitated. Imagine how excellent it would be, if I stood that tall. I know it is unattainable *blaming genes* (only joking!), but I can dream! heheh no I thank God for who I am & utterly trust Him for who I will become =)   Oh well over it.  Opps, I guess I forgot to welcome you into my world? My little raetarded world. Hehehehe. It looks like I will be deprived of the outside society for another three weeks or so. I received my English Assessment back which was rather good considering I came second, and nothing ever is learnt in class. Yet, upon receiving this, we were handed another. On King Lear. In Nino's words,      'King Lear can ...'    hahaha no not really. But bearing in mind this assessment was literally piled onto the Economics Presentation, Economics Timeline, Database Solution, Database Presentation, Legal Studies Environmental Analysis, Religious Comparison & Legal Studies Presentation on Family Law I already have due. Eight assessments required to be accomplished by the end of three weeks *sigh* .  Funny how I get marked absent even though I am present in class. Funny how I get marked here even though I am absent from class. For example, Hume that silly boy! Convinced Mr. Hollis that I was in hospital after enduring a severe asthma attack. Although I was in fact in class all week! And if you knew Hume, he wasn't the believeable boy type! hahaha dont worry we still love you :) He brings me amusement to our Legal Studies Club: Hume, Sam & I!    FC ! hehehe dumbass - you know who you are :p And Joe! I'll get you back! It was really good to catch up with Coleen. After all she is my neighbour. Although we can be abit naughty..hahah its all outta luv! And Cheska.. that little friend of mine! Love her to bits =) Love them both to bits!   Better stop blogging before I get carried away. Oh. Keep Living the American Dream! Yes you! hahah  -- feeling *bleh* --

      Hii darling!.  I swear I would never succumb to this. Using electricity to summarize my day. But since I haven't gotten the chance to update my untouched diary in too long, I guess this is pretty useful since I'm on this computer half of my life! People like coleen & mary have probably influenced my decision on creating this. I don't know. I just find it rather interesting that I can catch up with my Year 12 friends through their bloggings. Its like when I saw Mary at the YFC Anniversary..it felt like I was readily & updated enough. Despite the fact I haven't seen her in too long! But yeah since that was ages ago..  Right now I'm thinking (as always hehe). But people have got me thinking. Individuals can be so deep (not saying who)..so deep that they become emotionally retarded that they get lost in their own dwellings of emotions. Emotion itself is such a deep word. But yesterday I was speaking to someone, trying to counsel them (as always) but there. *pop* they got lost in their emotionally distressed world. So lost & confused that no matter how hard they tried, they fell deeper into that little back hole. I get that alot so Im pretty much used to it. But I cant help but feel for the person, you know? Hence why psychology would not be a very good course to take upon next year. I get too wrapped up in everyone else's dramas or whatever that I myself get emotionally involved. But why am I thinking so much. Anyway I do pray for that person I honestly do. Thay they may be happy & content with what they have, let go any regrets & forgive themselves.   Patricia and I, came up with this theory. She reckons she's got the pearly whites to lure everyone. Whilst I on the other hand believes its the heart..it is though. I'm more attracted to the heart (and I do have a hair fetish I must admit haha). But going to an all boy school..yes there are some up there with the good sort..hahaha you know what I'm talking about darling! But a good heart? mhmm..  Anyways I talked to Cheska today! I miss her. Hurry hurry Year 12! Finish already. Let alone all of the other assessments I have to get through - 7 to be in fact. And there's only three weeks of this term left! Remember that song by Peter Andre? Give me some kind of sign girl? hahahahehe just finishing with a random quote!  Happy birthday Reena! And Fran! haha *beautiful eyes*   -- feeling sick *cough* --

      how raetarded does that sound.  &nbsp;  hehehe after a week of what? Receiving final assessments, getting back into the swing of things, catching up, missing a few, ups, downs, high lows on a merry go round - this week was rather..*thinking of the most suitable word* uncanny? The trials are dawning upon me, and at that thought I am  terrified . But scared in a way where it is healthy. Instead of I frantically stressing upon such 'trials,' I employ those sources of energy through studying & the art of pilates. Thank God for pilates - I believe I am quite the follower. Not Roman Pilates&nbsp;who reasoned&nbsp;Jesus to death hell no. Is that even his name? hahah. I am stressing the significance of another form of pilates - a style&nbsp;of&nbsp;chinese expression through the use of body movement. It releases endorphines into my system & enhances my ability to move, react &amp; use my time efficiently as well as toning the upper & lower abdomen as well as the powerhouse. Only for the price of&nbsp;$99.99 plus postage & handling. Call 1800&nbsp;PILATE. hahahah silly me.  &nbsp;  Through the caricature of I, you will delve into a wondrous trot - ambiguous at times. But honestly real.  &nbsp;  hahaha oh shush.  &nbsp;  Be back later my homies! TTFN TGIF  &nbsp;  --&nbsp;dancing with&nbsp;I in the summmmer rain!&nbsp;--&nbsp;

      oh my.  &nbsp;  4 girls 1 boy 1 sassy 1 sleepover  &nbsp;  I absolutely adore having them [cousins] stay. It was just an unforutnate that I happened to have school the next day oh shoot! After various monopoly games & movies..it was time for them to head on home to their abodes. After having 12 people within your house for 48 hours..the difference without their presence is somewhat apparent. So there&nbsp;they go again - my organic&nbsp;supplies of&nbsp;prozac.  &nbsp;  Movie One:  Hellboy   &nbsp;  The irony of this&nbsp;movie is (despite the title being a&nbsp;juxtaposition)&nbsp;&nbsp;I managed to learn a new & intriguing quote, that I now adhere to.  &nbsp;     'Like  one  for their qualities, love  them  for their defects.'        &nbsp;

For the  love  of socks! I never used to wear them. But I LOVE socks.   And now Im terribly bruising. If it swells! I may have to get a neck cast! It's absolutely unmovable.

      I will write.   I will write without delving into my all-embracing already-extensive vocabulary.  Tis been a long time. And this weekend - seemed to surpass all of my expectations as well as time. Where does that lovely bloke go? Especially when you want more of it! But you cant have it. But you wish you did anyway.  Friday Night - hahaha I swear. Those girls bring tickles to me without touching me! And I absolutely love synthetic tickles due to my finger phobia & all haha. As Ingrid arrived, she looked passed Grace & Kathy who were already here, ran straight to who else..& gave me the hug! hahaha. And then Kristine came. And then MONICA! Oh boy I was excited to see that she had made it! Toothbrushes, quilts, pillows & all - these gurls were well-equipped for what we had yearned for so long.  Tomato faced, tomato sauced, disordered & spiced up - there we were having our messiest dinner ever. Probably ravaged through at least 50 tissues hahaha *kathy* And guess who showed up at that moment? John Lennon! I love him! He's probably the most gorgeous uncle existant! And he's only 2.   I brought down probably my family's supply of toys & stuffed animals for that little fella. And what did he do? Hit everyone. hahahah hes the best! Learnt from the best ;p I made everyone tolerate   'Bring it on Again'   which is far by the most nastiest sequel ever made. Trust me, its beyond nasty! So geh! Then we endured bout 30min of football. But with much thanks to Grace my dear. hahahaha oh she supplies the best entertainment. Don't think nasty! Oh she's adorable.  After pressurizing Kristine to sleep over, we turned to the karaoke - as always. This lasted bout 2 hours? Singing to such sweet melodies, old school tunes & all-time favourites. Highlight? Grace & her vulgar *sex bomb* haha, we even attempted to call Elton. We even managed to finish bout 5 songs all up hahah. But then..nothing but a bit of chocolate cake & milk at 3am! Heheh. We were having so much fun! Especially with the UNO where their TRUE COLOURS came out. hahahah. The boys? Were half dead. haha. But oh well. We'll see them in the morning for breakfast. Maybe we could've *spiced up their lives* hahahaha in a completely plutonic innocent way thankyou very much!  Much Ado About Nothing.   Heh some random quote hahaha. Alright - after a bathroom intermission, we settled into sleep mode. But I insisted, the night was still young. And nothing but a good chit chat or *honesty forum* i'd like to call it. What did we talk bout? hrmmm..friends? boyfriends? boys? girls? hahahaha?! They couldn't stop scouting! From my yearbook! particularly page 153 hahahahahahah we couldn't get over it. Oh sigh* I miss them already.  Grace's CD..maatee..hahah..I listened intently to my song for that somebody. And no its not love. hahaha all that mushy gurly lovey stuff. Then after bout a wholesome 3 hour chat? Kathy, Kristine & Monica drifted off. Grace! oh my. I gave her an ultimatum. TO STAY QUIET FOR 10 MINS? For me to get some shut eye. But no. So there we are at 5:30am in the morning playing Monopoly. I so won that game! And then! With about two hours to go before we had to make breakfast..we insisted that the other girls play PANTS w. us. And I won that aswell! hahah..it was slack. We woke them up to play pants.   Grace went to sleep. at last! then Kathy & I had a bit of a chat. Before we knew it, the sun was up & it was time to make breakfast! Elton came over. Monica was still in bed. hahah the pancakes & eggs were devoured. And abit of UNO was played again. Before they all headed for their abodes =(.  The rest of the weekend was consumed by taking out John, having no sleep for at least 57 hours & dancing by myself in the summer rain hahaha. I went out with cousins to keep myself readily alert & occupied during the no-sleep era. My, the weekend was not so bad after all. In fact, it was probably what I needed. A break from the usual. A break from everyone. A break from myself. It was very much nourishing & pleasureable I must admit.  We haven't changed abit.   And at that thought, I'm at ease.   -- my prozac come back! --

      oooh can't wait!  Today I will clean. Today I will cook! Today I will laugh. or cry even!  Today I will have a party. A mexican party. With gurls. Plenty of gurls! And a few boys.  heheheh! *tssss! no! stop thinking!   But wait. Its a sleepover!  toot & woot* haha  Today I am having the SAC girls come over for a lil get-together. Some of them I haven't seen for seven months..others four months..others 24 hours! Yet oh boy I am excited. All the same ;) And not only are they coming over. But my cousins from the coast are also visiting & John Lennon will also make an appearance. How exciting! So much to do in so little time! geh! I miss these girls so much! For 11 years, they were my backbone, my zone, my friends, my vents, my support, my prozac - my happiness. Since the time I have moved schools (to good old Oakhill), they have never failed me, disappointed me, neglected nor forgotten me. And I am so proud to have them as my friends! We have all travelled down this long road together, since pre-school for some of us. They know me inside & out - I know them inside & out. And at this time, this vitally critical moment in time, right now or lately as it seems - these girls are the only ones who I can really depend on. They have seen me go through so much! And I am utterly proud to have them here in my life - love you so so much!  -- who? melbourne? forgotten. --

      Thank God I was not blogging last night! gah..I was on a roll..sorry for those who witnessed it! hahah you know who you are. All good :D  Memories suck! It's the memories that always hold you back from moving on & accepting the present. It's the good ones that equip you with a *false* hope & *wishful* thinking. It's the bad ones that you remember the most.   oh shush.  I had the chance to catch up with a few people. Kristine made me eat peanut butter. Grace: Its called..lovee! awwhhh *tear she's growing up. Ian: you'll be okies ;) Even though you may be giving up..I am not.  It was juss really weird last night. An emotional rollercoaster ride perhaps? I had a chat to Gez - who is leaving me for Melbourne! Ian left today. Coleen's leaving on thursday! Let me mention what I felt last night talking to various people. Anger, sorrow, happiness, pity, *kilegs* hahaha, regret, *tear, joy, excitement & drive. All last night. Am I not making sense? Yeah thought so.  It doesn't make sense cause I can't blog everything right now. Im sorry! I will update you as soon as I can!  -- kickin' it --

You're so greaat!   I've had some pretty awesome conversations lately. Especially on Wednesday night? Catching up with Cres was excellent! Forgot how lovely it was to talk to her =) I misss her!

Came to pick I up at school even though I wasn't there! Aw no! Thanks for the thought though =)  Let's just say the future holds interesting things. A whole lot of it will change drastically - maybe for the better, or worse. Who knows? But I am excited all the same ;) Assessments are finished! Don't get me wrong, I am relieved..but these holidays aren't going to be my average holidays - only bout 100 days to go. I am very disappointed with my Trials Timetable though. It's horrible. But I cannot wait til my trip to Hunter Valley - golf oughta do it.  Everyone's leaving me! ALL are going to Melbourne! *friendless* That's okies. At least I will keep myself occupied with party party parties! Kat's 19th, Jess' 17th, Ness' 18th, Joe's 18th, Keira's 18th, Hazel's 18th - forgot who else. hehe party poop.

      2 girls, 1 boy, 1 catfight  hahhah honestly placing Ryan, Coleen & I in the same room equates to some serious fun & festivities in the sun. In actuality, we had a catfight. It all happened after Ryan received a phone call & I callously grabbed the phone off him. But mini-me was not enough, measured against this big friendly giant, as some would say. So Coleen being the loyal friend she is, jumped in for my sake. So bear with I & metally picture what is happening. It was all jam-packed action from then on! As I scooted across my lounge room with the phone hurrah! And locked myself in the bathroom. Yet this big friendly giant sadistically shoved the bathroom door against I which impelled Coleen to save I again! She bravely pinned the big friendly giant to the floor whilst I throughly checked the phone for any interesting materials. To my amazement, the falls, scratches & bruises were not all quite worth it. Nothing, nothing at all existed in the phone.  Placing that aside, with the background ensembling the quiet sounds of Can't Hardly Wait, we plunged into a deep & meaningful conversation. At least we tried to. Ever have a talk with Ryan? He get's totally sidetracked sometimes that a 10 minute conversation becomes a two hour one. Interestingly enough, we three managed to 'come clean' with each other, delving into secrets untold & what not. We even managed to reminisce about..hahahaha..my apologies but I will make this section into a *forbidden forest.* Oh joy! They attempted to teach I how to rollerblade but no success there. hehehe oh my two bestest friends in the world! hahaha isn't it ironic how that came about? oops *forbidden forest* hehehehe  -- lackin mentality --

      oh so I missed you my gorgeousnesses ;)  Its been too long. No need to anticipate any longer! And let me tell you now. These trials were  trials.  Not for I only, but for the rest of Year 12 & for those not even Year 12. Some of them are still experiencing them right now &amp; just letting you know my love & prayers will always be with you ;) This past week..oh boy. Yesterday alone. My thumb is still suffering repurcussions from the of energy of an atrocious inanimate pen! 30 pages with a crooked thumb (yes folks I cannot do the *thumbs up* or *cowabunga* for I was born w. a little thing called a *soft bone* which entitles me to such clicking most *abnormal* people cannot perform). I like to thimk myself as normal. hahaha so not cool. I'm serious! haha. Anyway, the last hour really did take effect on me. Darn computing & legal studies! geh. Having 6 exams in 4 days impelled me to go through ridiculous extremities.  Over it.  But have no fear. I am rewarded w. a much needed one &amp; a half week off! ;) I plan to drive. Master the arts of rollerblading. And really contemplate & discern about my future. I plan to hang outties w. everyone &amp; catch up w. everyone. Speaking of which, let me place emphasis on how much I could not do w.out friends! oh my. In Gez's words  - real friendage ! Your prolonging words of wisdom, support & encouragement was overwhelming. Oh I'm definately feelin the   luv  ! I feel rather *gatty* if such a word exists. In respect to the sudden surge of sms' from everyone of gat.04! First was from  Jodz . oawwh man she's adorable. I   luv   my second best! She called me 'GC' again hahahah. For those of you who would like to know what that means..you are more than welcome to dial 1800 help me! Or you could always ask my customers Odyssey &amp; Coleen nicely. I ensure you that they would be more than happy to expain. hahah peace! Anywho.. gerry  always brings a smile to my face ;) Through her constant msging farrout I   luv   her! I missed her way too much. Through her simple actions, I was more than happy to spread the   luv  ! I reached  melle , our mother-type, babe-leader & ever awe-inspiring friend! And  k.merv  whom I also dearly miss ;) He was our father. In fact, I still refer to him as papa & he refers to I as anak. heheh &amp;  Joy ! Who gave me that little bit of encouragement & prayer which was greatly appreciated ;) oawwwh shucks. I miss everyone so so much :)  One more exam to go! And I will kill it. Promise. I owe that much to myself & everyone else who's been there w. me. The fams, friends, school - thankyou! ;) Oh. I got terrible news. I am not going to Phils ;( I'm headed straight for the magical island of Hawaii ;) But I really was looking foward to the Phils. I want to see my cousins! Esp. the little girls. Smart lil gorgeous ones. I want to see how theyre doing. oh well there's always next year. ;) Should I go to Hunter Valley? hrmm. Meanwhile..I gotta run. Literally run.  I had a great talk w. gerry tonight! Love you kiddos :)  -- get out! right now. --
