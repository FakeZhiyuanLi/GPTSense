      I woke up around 11:00 today and wandered aimlessly around the house.  Now that school is out, there is really nothing to do.  I went to practice around 13:00.  That's 1:00 PM for those who don't speak European.  The weather was annoying because it was warm and sunny, then it would get cold and rainy, then warm and humid, then cold and cloudy, then drizzle, then pour, then sunny, then pour again, then sunny......  We played a fun little game where you had to shoot the ball off the crossbar and kick it in the goal on the volley.  I did it once and seriously screwed up my hip flexor.  Then we started making bets trying to hit various objects off of various posts from various angles from various distances.  We were just looking for stuff to do.  If more people showed up we could have scrimmaged. (Practice Wednesday at 13:00 on Fedora Field)  I was driving home and more crazy weather struck.  The skies opened up and I was driving through a wall of water.  I could not see a damn thing.  The streets were flooding and the windshield wipers weren't wiping fast enough.  I was driving under black clouds then suddenly everything was clear.  Blue skies, white fluffy clouds, and sunshine greeted me after I drove past watery hell behind me.  Random thought:  I really like those "Fanta" commercials.  The song is quite catchy.  Much to my dismay Xavier Malisse lost in the fourth round 7-5, 6-2, 7-6 (8-6) to 12th ranked Lleyton Hewitt in the French Open today.  He still can win some hardware for he advanced to the fourth round of the men's doubles championship.  The same goes for Virginia Ruano Pascual.  She lost in the fourth round, but advanced to the quarters of the women's doubles championship.  Another random thought:  I was just watching "X-Play", a show about videogames, and I just learned that a "weinernut" is a hot dog in the shape of a doughnut with the hole of the doughnut as a basin to hold cheese, relish, ketchup, and mustard.  Wow.  Just when I thought they made everything...  Now I must go.  I have alot to do tomorrow morning.  Bye.

      I had today set up perfectly.  So I was up past midnight last night making the preceding post and it was close to game time between the Los Angeles Galaxy and the Dallas Burn.  I decided to stay up and watch the game, which I did.  (Quick recap: L.A. destroyed Dallas 4-1.  A player I don't like, Steve Jolley, had a game to forget.  He blocked a cross with his jollies [pun intended], headed the ball into his own goal, and deflected a Jovan Kirovski shot into his own goal.  Kirovski received credit for the goal, but it really should have been another own goal by Steve Jolley.  Sasha Victorine, Jolley (o.g.), and Kirovski [2 goals, one from the penalty spot] scored for Los Angeles and Ronnie O' Brien scored for Dallas.) Staying up past 02:30 reminded me of when I woke up at 01:30 to watch the 2002 World Cup everyday.  I would stay awake most of the time and watch the games while everyone else in the house was sound asleep.  I remember this one time where I was up from 01:30 and watched all three games (including the game where Italy dominated Equador 2-0) and fell back asleep around 08:30.  I woke up when my mom came home from work at 14:30.  That's 2:30 PM for those of you who don't speak European.  I know some of you are saying, "2:30 PM?  I wake up at that time every day!"  Well, I don't.  If I could I would.  It's just that my mum usually wakes me up around 09:30 (for no good reason) and if she doesn't I can't sleep past 10:30.  Yes, everyone laughed at me and ridiculed me for sacrificing much needed sleep for the beautiful game.  I swear, that whole month I had to have gotten a grand total of about 15 hours of sleep.  Most of it during the day.  I was going to sleep late today, but I figured that since I didn't get to watch the Fire game I could watch the replay online.  Well they weren't showing it.  They weren't even showing the highlights.  I was not happy.  I woke up at 08:00 for nothing then.  I decided to stay awake and watch tennis so it wasn't so bad.  Xavier Malisse advanced to the round of 16 while Virginia Ruano Pascual lost in the third round. (or was it the fourth round?)  So with my Fire game watching hopes dashed, I waited for the Indy 500.  It was raining over there.  Damn, now I have to wait out a super long rain delay.  They got the race started about 2 hours late and ran about 25 laps when the rain started again.  Bloody hell.  I just have no luck.  They were close to getting it back under way, but I had to go with my mom and dad to my grandmum's house (the good grandmum) for a while.  After that we went shopping and I got some Chinese Fooooooood (and then?) for myself and went home.  By the time we were home, the Indy 500 was well over.  Buddy Rice won, which meant that David Letterman (yes the talk show host) won his first Indy 500 as an owner.  Quick Rant:  For some reason, my mum and dad have been taking me along on their endless shopping excursions and when they go they play this  Ultimate Manilow  CD.  Now, it takes alot for music to aggravate me and I was OK with it... FOR THE FIRST 40 FRIGGIN' TIMES!!!  Bloody Hell!  They play this every single waking moment of the day.  And it's all of that sappy love song crap, which I can remotely get into on very rare occasions, but not every damn day.  Jesus H. Christ.  So we got home and the Coca-Cola 600 was already past half way done.  I didn't miss much considering Jimmie Johnson was annihilating the whole field.  So I watched the end of the race while I munched on Moo Goo Gai Pan and my Egg Rolls. (why does that sound dirty?) Jimmie Johnson deservedly won the race.  He made this sick nasty pass where he slipped between a lapped car and Kasey Kahne in the middle of a turn.  He must drive on the expressway alot.  I think I'm getting sick again so I better go and get some sleep.  I really need it.  I have practice tomorrow at 13:00 on Fedora Field.  That's 1:00 PM for those of you who don't speak European.  And Fedora Field is what Pat and I named the practice field.  I want to call the stadium Spellman Stadium, but Pat doesn't like it.  I do.  It's an honour to have the stadium named after you.  More honourable than a practice field.  Anyway, off I go.  Bye.

      Dear Christ.  No, the title is not wrong.  I've been out for 7 hours at a bunch of stores shopping with my mom and dad.  I was shopping for a multitude of necessities for my trip to Italy.  I got shorts, a few shirts, a toiletries pouch and some chips, but that was for the seemingly endless car rides to a new store.  We also searched for gifts for my exchange student and his family.  I think we did well.  The only thing is that when you are around my mum for a long time, she tends to get... how do I say it... oh yeah, annoying.  It's not bad, it's just... annoying.  It's hard to explain, but she just endlessly blabbers on about stuff.  Oh well, it's all good.  I would rather have that than if she was silent all the time.  I also missed watching the Fire game online.  Because I'm a cheap bastard, I don't subscribe to get all of the MLS games on satelite so I have to watch the home Fire games on my computer that has a shaky on-line connection.  I guess I will wake up early tomorrow and watch the replay online.  I will be going to bed late because the Los Angeles Galaxy v. Dallas Burn match is on tonight at 00:30.  That's 12:30 AM if you don't speak European.  Ugh, it is going to be a late night.  One more thing.  My dad went to the currency exchange and he exchanged $300 and we got 240 Euros back.  The Euros are cool b/c they are different colours and different sized depending on the bill.  For example, the 5 Euro bills are green and roughly 6.5 x 12 cm.  The 10 Euro bills are red and roughly 7 x 12.5 cm.  And the 20 Euro bills are blue and roughly 7.5 x 13 cm.  I like how they are different colours and different sizes.  That's just real cool.  And I forget that it is money and treated as such because I am so used to seeing dollar bills.  These just seem like coloured play money.  I almost lost it a few times.  That certainly would suck.  OK, off I go.  Big day tomorrow... OK, today.  It just turned midnight.  I have to watch Los Angeles v. Dallas, Fire v. Colorado, Indy 500, and Coca-Cola 600 tomorrow.  Someone has to do it.  It may as well be me.  Bye.

      My summer vacation has officially begun as of 9:30.  My Spanish final was difficult, but I think I did fairly well.  Some of the questions were confusing and the reading part took me a long time so I had to rush through the other questions a lot more than I had wanted to.  But all in all it was pretty good.  So that was it.  The 2003/2004 school year was over.  Arrivederci Junior year.  One more left.  Just one more year until... I don't know.  Summer break started the best way possible.  After I shamelessly promoted my blog, I walked out to my car to go home and do nothing.  Just then who do I see but Steve!  He needed a ride so I was more than happy to oblige.  He mentioned going to Mickey D's for breakfast and I figured why the hell not?  So we went, I had the Steak, Egg, and Cheese Bagel and he had the Two Breakfast Burritos.  When we left we saw Howie and Scott walk in.  We greeted them and Howie and I exchanged "man-hugs".  We went back to Steve's place where I watched him get the monkey feces beat out of him in  Ninja Gaiden  and then I joined him in playing an amusing round of  Halo.   It was hilarious when we were on the same team, but Steve kept killing me on purpose.  That's what friends are for.    Visit Steve's blog here:    urlLink Bubbadoo4you    Eventually I had to go home.  When I got home I was watching an interview of Andrew W.K. on Conan O'Brien.  Mr. W.K. has a genius plan of gaining weight that I have to try.  When he was a wee lad, his situation was similar to mine.  While everyone is trying to lose weight, we are trying to gain weight.  I won't lie to y'all.  I am freakishly skinny.  I am 5'9" and 113 lbs.  That's not too good.  So that's why I might do this strange diet plan.  It's the Sweet and Salty diet plan.  First, eat a lot of sweet stuff like candy and donuts and cake and stuff like that.  When you are full, or tired of sweets, eat salty stuff like potato chips and french fries.  When you are full of salty stuff, go back to sweets and just continue until you gain at least 20 pounds.  Just eat a helluva lot of unhealthy crap and you'll be set.  Well, that's all for now.  I'm looking forward to this weekend.  The Fire play at home against Colorado, and the Indy 500 and Coca-Cola 600 are on Sunday.  Yes, I'm hoping for a Fire win and two great races.  Talk to y'all tomorrow.  Bye. urlLink

      Tomorrow is it.  The last final for me.  The last official school work as a Junior.  The last test until August.  But tomorrow will not be an easy task.  The final final is Spanish.  Strangely enough I feel very confident.  Spanish has been extremely hard this semester, but in the recent weeks I have been doing very well.  That momentum will carry over into tomorrow's test.  I will destroy Spanish.  I fear nothing.  I have to relinquish my title of Iron Chef.  I was cooking a frozen pizza in the oven and I undercooked it.  It turned out terrible.  I hang my head in shame.  It may be a surprise to many of you, but one of my favourite sports is tennis.  I was watching The French Open coverage today and I was pleased to see some of my favourite players advance.  I like the underdogs.  Players no one knows like Xavier Malisse from the men's side and Virginia Ruano Pascual from the women's braket.  Malisse made an incredible run to the Wimbledon quarterfinals a year or two ago and Ruano Pascual plays doubles with partner Paola Suarez.  Ruano Pascual and Suarez are ranked first in the world in women's doubles.  Malisse won his third round match against Daniel Elsner and advanced with a 6-3, 4-0 (retired) win.  The Belgian will take on Albert Costa in the quarterfinals.  Malisse had to play double duty as he and Olivier Rochus advanced past Todd Martin and Mikhail Youzhny 6-3, 2-6, 6-3.  Ruano Pascual won her third round match against 12th ranked Ai Sugiyama 6-7 (4-7), 6-2, 6-1.  Ruano Pascual will face Francesca Schiavone in the quarterfinals.  Ruano Pascual also had to play two matches as she and Suarez easily advanced past Gulnara Fattakhetdinova and Galina Fokina 6-1, 6-3.  Now I must go to bed.  I'm tired and I have a huge final tomorrow.  The end is nigh.

      OK, before I get to the important stuff I want to recap a post I did not make yesterday.  I had the day off, did nothing, and did not study for any finals.  Today, I had a U.S. History final (it sucked massively) and a Physics final. (it wasn't too bad)  Tomorrow I have a Religion final and an English final.  Again, I didn't study.  OK, now that the boring crap is out of the way, it is time for what really matters.  CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL!!!  'Twas a great final.  It was between France's AS Monaco and Portugal's FC Porto.  These two teams defyed all odds as they are not the heavyweights of European football.  (That's soccer if you don't speak European)    AS Monaco were the lucky dogs of the competition as they beat Germany's Bayern Munich 2-2 on aggregate, (away goals 1-0) shocked the world with a stunning come from behind win against Spain's supergiants Real Madrid 5-5 on aggregate, (away goals 3-2) and eased past Chelsea 5-3 on aggregate to lead them to the final.  FC Porto reached the final when Benni McCarthy sunk England's supergiants Manchester United with a last minute goal.  Porto won the series 3-2 on aggregate.  Porto then got past France's Olympique Lyonnais 4-2 on aggregate.  Porto would play Spain's Deportivo La Coruna for 180 minutes and manage only one goal, (and that was from the penalty spot) but that was all they needed as they advanced to the final 1-0 on aggregate.  Then today's final...  Monaco ended up playing a dreadful match and gave the cup to FC Porto three goals to nil.  If you want, you can read my review here.    urlLink FC Porto : AS Monaco    Coach Didier Deschamps consoles his players. Someone has to lose.

      Today was the last full day of school so that meant that today was the last lunch period.  Over the past months many good times have been shared with my friends Greg, Kim, and Gina (and Anna for the first semester) and many songs have been sung.  Here are some of the best moments of this lunch period:  I remember dubbing Gina with the name "Tubesock" after trying to explain to her how a tubesock was different than a normal sock.    I remember explaining to her that Holland is a country, not in Poland and their culture consists of wooden shoes, windmills, those funny windmill cookies and last names that have lots of vowels and start with "van" or "van der". (Ex: van Nistelrooy, van der Vaart, van Hooijdonk, van der Saar)    I remember singing the Zoobalie Zoo song with my mouth full of cookies and sounding like a retarded person.  I remember singing the Goldfishes song.  I remember singing Jimmy Crack Corn and I Don't Care at random.  I remember going with Gina to buy chips or pop or candy for no particular reason except just to go with her.  I remember Gina and Kim teaming up on me trying to kill me by tickling me to death and trying to get revenge by poking Gina's ticklish sides.  I remember discovering the fact that spoon backwards is "noops" and Zoop backwards is "pooz" and Zoobalie Zoo backwards is "ooz eilabooz".  Yes, lunch was great this year indeed.  I'm looking forward to next year already.  I took a picture of us at our last lunch today.  Maybe I will post that eventually.

      I do not want to make a post.  I am in an awful mood.  The Chicago Fire lost to the Columbus Crew 3-1 at home on national TV today.  It was the most abhorrent display of soccer I have ever seen.  I don't want to talk about it.  I don't want to talk about anything else for that matter.  Go away.

       The theme of Saturday (right now it is early Sunday) was sports.  Sure there was some wicked weather and that may be a tad important considering how dangerous it was, but really Saturday's sports transcended all of that for me.    First I woke up at 9:00 to watch the Live Commentary of the FA Cup final match between Manchester United and Millwall.  If you don't follow what the English call "football" Manchester United is one of the best teams in the English Premiership or all of Europe for that matter.  Millwall is a midtable team in England's first division (one division lower and the Premiership) who was lucky to make it past the fourth round let alone all the way to the finals.  Anyway, Man U had an easy time winning 3-0.  American goalkeeper Tim Howard became the first American to play in a FA Cup final since John Harkes did for Sheffield Wednesday in 1993 and first American to win the FA Cup ever.  Congrats to Timmy Howard.  He won the FA Cup, won Premiership Goalkeeper of the year honours, had a 0.97 Goals Against Average, got a bunch of clean sheets, plays for one of the best clubs around the world... but only managed to beat my Chicago Fire once out of 10 games when he played for the Metrostars!! Take that!  Then the girls soccer playoff game.  They played the hardest I have ever seen them play.  I'll be honest ladies, not necessarily the best, but certainly the hardest.  The game was 0-0 for most of the match, but in the final 15 minutes Andrew managed to out score us 2-1.  It was a great season.  I enjoyed going to your home games (and some away games too) no matter if you won or lost.  Next was the Cubs 7-1 win over the Cardinals.  I didn't watch the game because I was at the girls soccer game.  Hey, I thought "watch the Cubs or watch the girls soccer game.  What should I do?"  I chose the latter and I made the right choice.  When I got home from the game, I watched the New England Revolution v. Metrostars match.  It was a well played match as New England really dominated the second half.  Pat Noonan scored for the Revolution and Cornell Glen scored for the Metrostars.  I gave my legs a wicked workout as I used this exercise machine in my house.  You sit on a seat and push it back with your legs while two elastic bands resist the seat.  I was on it for over 30 minutes and did over 1200 reps and I can still feel it.  Next was the NASCAR All-Star Race.  When the Nextel Open got the green flag, there was a pile up before the first turn of the first lap.  Hey guys, drive much?  In the main event, there was another wreck when Kurt Busch ran into Greg Biffle and after that all hell broke loose.  My favourite driver Tony Stewart won the first segment, but finished 3rd.  Matt Kenseth won.  Finally, I watched the San Jose Earthquakes v. Los Angeles Galaxy match online.  To put it lightly, these two teams HATE each other.  Last year in the playoffs, Los Angeles had a 4-0 aggregate lead with about a half hour left in the second leg and San Jose came back to score five times and advance. (It was the greatest MLS game ever) Today, San Jose got out to a 3-0 lead and when they thought it was safe, Los Angeles pulled two back to make it 3-2 courtesy of Andreas Herzog and Joseph Ngwenya. (Herzog has got to be one of the best passers I have ever seen) But a monumental comeback was not to be as Dwayne DeRosario put the game away for good with a strike of his own to seal the win for the 'Quakes 4-2.  Oh yeah, the Tampa Bay Lightning beat the Philadelphia Flyers 2-1 in Game 7 of the NHL Eastern Conference playoffs.  Tomorrow I will be glued to the tube again as my Chicago Fire play the Columbus Crew at Soldier Field on ESPN 2 at 15:00.  That's 3 pm if you don't speak European.  'Till then, see ya and go Fire.  Oh yeah, check out my good friend Stephen's blog  urlLink Bubbadoo's Place

      Ugh.  I feel like feces.  I most definitely did not want to go to school.  I was dreading the fact that I would not only go to school, but to soccer as well which meant I would probably not get home until after 18:00.  That's 6 pm if you don't speak European.  So I went to school and fortunately it is the end of the year, which means work is at a minimum.  I did have to take a Spanish test however.  It wasn't very hard for a change.  Math was certainly fun though.  All I did was grade Geometry papers.  When school was over I went home and took an hour and a half nap.  Yes, life is good.  One more thing about yesterday and it's a good thing.  I went to the girl's soccer game and was treated to a 5-0 Marian win over Crete-Monee.  It was a well played game all around.  I was impressed with the goals we scored.  Hard work, good teamwork, and a deft shot gave us a well deserved five-nil rout against an archrival.  It was a good result considering they bounced back from a disappointing 5-0 loss to Homewood-Flossmoor.  Well done.  Good luck in the playoffs.

       Today I had to take the last half of my trigonometry final.  Usually completing a final would be something to be excited about, but I knew that when I finished the exam and the bell rang I would never see most of the seniors ever again, for today was the senior's last day.   It was strange to see so many empty seats in physics class.  Most of the seniors didn't have to take the final exam.  A few did though, and for them it was just another physics class period.  Talking about the Sox, talking about movies, talking about college, talking about nothing in general, and making jokes was all that happened.  Oh yeah, and something about a final, but no one really paid any attention to that.  Yup, same old, same old.   The rest of the day went on as planned until 7th period ended.  I was walking back to my locker where I saw my good friend and lab partner Michele.  I knew this would be the last time I would ever see her so I made sure I gave her a nice good-bye.  She summed it up really well when she said that she would most likely never see me again and she wished me a good life.  It was a hurried good-bye because she was going one way and I was headed another.  I guess that could be perceived as a nice symbolic ending to a friendship.   So there I was in trigonometry class.  I was ready to finish the final, but not the class.  Over the past months, some of the best times of the year were made in that class.  The best part about it was I contributed to the good times.  Usually I'm just an observer who watches the good times, but I made many of them happen in this class.  I was known as "weird kid".  Never had I been known for anything in any other class.  It really felt good to open up and be noticed.   So there I was at my desk working hard on the final.  With about five problems to go I looked at my watch and it read 14:10.  That's 2:10 pm if you don't speak European.  So with only 10 minutes left a thought came to me.  In 10 minutes I will never see most of the people in this class ever again.  It's a harsh reality when you see them everyday for nine months and suddenly they are gone.  In fact, I've known some of them two or even three years.  It is naturally hard to say good-bye to so many people you have come to know and grow close to for so long.  It will be even harder next year when I have to say good-bye to everyone I know, good friends and all, not just a select group of people that I knew from a few classes.  But as I like to think, the hard times in one's life can not be stopped.  They will come.  It is how you handle them and get past them that makes you who you are and makes you better.  When the bell eventually rang and I turned in my test and I went back to my desk and just stood there and took one last look at everyone for the last time.  I guess this really was it.  I wanted to say bye to everyone, but most of everyone was still taking the test so I didn't.  I wish I did.  I did give Bux a good handshake and "man-hug" so I felt good that I at least did that.   That was that.  Good-bye to every one who made going to class a lot more enjoyable.  Good-bye to everyone who made homework, tests, and grades a little less of a burden.  Good-bye to Kate, Michele, Jon, Kevin, Bux, Steve, Amy, Kris, Andy, Missy, Blondie, Chris, Chuckie, Rocky, Brandon, Bond, Dana, Magpie, Gina, and everyone else I shamefully forgot to mention.  However we knew each other, whether it was from soccer, to physics, to math, to other subjects or activities, thanks to you all.  I don't know if you feel the same about me, but you all made life a little bit better for me for that short time we knew each other.  Thanks a lot and good luck to you all.   Now I have that damn Green Day song in my head.

       Hello everybody.  This is my first post in my brand new blog.  I am new to this so it will take me a while to find new cool additions to post on my blog, but for the meantime, what you see is what you get.  I will post stuff about whatever I want.  Rants, random observations, news, personal stuff, and anything else in my slightly deranged mind.  I will try and post pictures as well.  I hope you will enjoy it.  Tell your friends about it too.

      Yes it is me and I am back from beautiful Italy!  It was the best time of my life and the most beautiful place I have ever seen.  I would make an epic post about how I loved Italy, but I won't.  I will make my daily post and at the end write about something that happened one day of the trip.  I will start tomorrow at the first day and post every day's events until I reach the end.  As for today's events, I woke up at 10:00 after sleeping 13 hours.  My room is the messiest room ever witnessed by mankind.  It's terrible.  Yeah, I guess I have to clean my own room again.  I wish I was in Italy.  I had practice today and there was only three of us there so there was nothing to do.  We shot at goal and stuff.  Then we ran by the cheerleaders.  That was my idea of course.  Then we worked on trapping and played some poker and went home.  I went to Chicago Dough for some pizza.  It felt great to have American pizza again.  Pizza in Italy is very plain.  The  Margherita  pizza is a thin layer of dough with crushed tomato sauce and cheese.  That's it.  So naturally I ordered a pizza today with everything on it.  Mmmmm... heavenly!  Also my favourite waitress took our order.  She was the waitress for my wild 16th b-day party.  That was a great time so whenever we see each other we are always nice to each other.  I also had McDonald's today.  It felt great to have a greasy, fatty, unhealthy double cheeseburger with super salty fries.  It was glorious.  That's all for now because I am so very tired.  More tomorrow.

      Hello from beautiful Italy!  The weather is great over here.  So far.  The days of 100° weather are soon to come.  I have to post real quick b/c I have to get up at 3:30 to see the Pope tomorrow.  I wrote a journal on the plane ride.  Its moderately interesting.  When I have time, I might post something about it.  I love this country.  On newspapers, on TV, on signs on walls, everywhere is stuff about Italy in Euro 2004.  Mmmmmmm... football.  Ain't it great?  Yes it is.  The luggage situation is bad however.  My mum and dad's stuff arrived, but the suitcase full of gifts and my suitcase did not.  As long as my soccer boots are OK and I get most of my new clothes back, I should be moderately happy.  Ok, now I'm off to go and go to bed.  In three hours I have to get up and see the Pope.  Ciao.

      Today will be the longest day.  It just past midnight so it is Sunday, June 13.  In 16 hours, I will be on a school bus with a bunch of other hooligans (cough:: Pohlman ::cough) on our way to O'Hare airport to catch a plane to London, England to catch a plane to Rome, Italy to catch a bus to San Benedetto del Tronto, Italy.  After the plane rides, layovers, and bus rides, I will be one tired American.  It all starts around 15:30.  That's 3:30 PM if you don't speak European.  Everyone who is going meets up in the Bloom parking lot to put their luggage and stuff on a van and board a bus that is going to O'Hare airport.  Once we get to O'Hare, we get our stuff and board the 20:20 plane.  That is 8:20 PM if you don't speak European.  I will arrive in London, England at 10:20 local time (that is a 7 hour plane ride) and board the 14:05 plane to Rome, Italy. (7:05 local time)  That is 2:05 PM if you don't speak European.  I will arrive in Rome at 17:30. (10:30 AM local time)  That is 5:30 PM if you don't speak European.  After I arrive in Rome, I will get on another school bus with everyone else and ride to San Benedetto del Tronto, meet up with the Quevedos, the family I will stay with for the next two weeks, and go home.  All that is today.  Yesterday, I got everything all packed up.  Clothes, gifts, reading material, snacks, music, shoes, everything.  It's all packed up and ready to go.  I am so excited I can't even type.  I was out all day yesterday looking for a Chicago Fire t-shirt and I came across a very troubling problem: NO STORES CARRY CHICAGO FIRE MERCHANDISE!!!!  Damn you all!!!  I could go on a huge rant, but I have a lot more to post and I need to get to bed soon.  As for Friday night's late night soccer?  Tremendous fun.  I had such a great time.  We played on a dimly lit tennis court.  We used one side of the court and set up two mini goals on either end.  Towards the end, lightning started to light the sky.  We played a bunch of 3 v. 3 games with one substitute.  I played moderately well considering my hip flexor was messed up pretty badly.  I got a goal, and a few good passes, and dug hard to win the ball and fight off a defender.  I also got kicked in the face.  Ahhhhh, the beautiful game.  How I love it.  I hope we do late night soccer again.  My Fire lost 3-2 to the Los Angeles Galaxy on Saturday afternoon.  It was good to see Ante Razov get back on the goal scoring track again.  He even scored a penalty kick on the same goal that Pat Onstad saved his penalty kick in MLS Cup 2003.  Ante is back, however, we do miss Armas and Beasley and Ralph and Williams so very desperately.  Let's hope Armas and Beasley make us proud and beat the living feces out of Grenada today.  You gotta love this:  today's strategy for the United States World Cup Qualifying match against Grenada?  "Go out there and annihilate them." and "Score as many goals as you can."  This should be fun.  Well, off to bed I go.  The next time you hear from me, I will be in beautiful Italy.  Ciao amici.

      Tonight, something monumental, something of epic porportions, something so crazy, it could only have been thought of by me will happen. (if everyone shows up)  Midnight Soccer.  Yes, we will gather and play until twilight.  Until it is high moon (clever isn't it?) we will grace the pitch in the pitch black.  It actually starts around 9, but it will end at midnight.  I will write about it most likely tomorrow.  Today's practice was anything but epic.  Four of us showed up.  We played the crossbar game for about a half hour and played cheap baseball for the rest of the time.  My mum I got a lot of stuff done for Italy today.  I got super sexy shirts that will have the Italian ladies on me like white on rice.  We also got cameras and an Italian dictionary and other stuff like that.  Tomorrow is Italy Eve.  Man, I am just so excited.  I can't think right now.  The Chicago Fire return to the place where the dream season ended in a nightmare.  They go back to the Home Depot Center to face the Los Angeles Galaxy live on ESPN 2 at 15:00.  That's 3:00 PM if you don't speak European.  Last year at the Home Depot Center, the Fire lost to the San Jose Earthquakes 4-2 in MLS Cup 2003.  Let's hope the Fire can overcome this field of nightmares.

      Finland and other Scandinavian countries have been known for their unique death metal style. One part thrashy guitar, one part harmonious guitar, one part brutal drums, one part thunderous bass, one part melodic keyboard, and one part scratchy vocals all come together to make a style that is greatly under-appreciated.    Kalmah , hailing from Finland, is no different. They follow this formula, but add their own self-dubbed "swampy" touch. Their first album,  Swamplord  exhibits their masterful musicianship. Antti Kokko's melodic guitar is first and foremost the highlight of this band. Many times, Antti's guitar licks are somewhat soothing while his brother Pekka's rhythm guitar blugeon the ears. This dynamic of grace and rage works astoundingly well.    Swamplord  starts off with "Evil in You", a speedy number that never lets up. The highlight of this song is towards the end where Antti's lead guitar repeats the most beautiful harmony on the album. At the very end, there is an interesting twist as a funeral organ closes out the song.   "Withering Away" is a song with a wonderful intro and a speedy tempo. This may, however, be the weakest song on the album.   Pasi Hiltula's keyboards and Antti Kokko's guitar shine on "Heritance of Berija". Everything on this track from the first note to the last note is simply majestic. Towards the beginning, there is a keyboard line that sounds like a violin. This touch to the song is spot on. Antti Kokko's leads are absolutely superb. There is another keyboard solo in the middle of the song that bridges the verse to the guitar solo. This guitar solo is the best on the whole CD. In the second half of the solo, the keyboard and the lead guitar harmonise creating a fantastic dynamic.   The atmosphere is heightened in "Black Roija" as the keyboard, Antti Kokko's lead guitar, and Pekka Kokko's rhythm guitar blend to add a mysterious and swampy feeling. The guitar solo has the feeling of a cold, dark alley in the summer night. This is yet another strong track.   The single to  Swamplord  is "Dance of the Water". This song opens with a eerie, cold keyboard intro. Ominous guitars enter and transition into another fabulous Antti Kokko guitar solo. The verse and chorus is different from the other songs as there are no harmonies or melodies. The lyrics portray an interesting picture to those who have the lyrics or those who can somehow understand the vocals. There is another excellent solo towards the end, which leads to a great harmony to close out the song.   "Hades" starts out with a lead that sounds like it came from a pirate movie for some reason. After the momentary break in the song, there is crushing drums and rhythm guitar, but a delicate little melody from the lead guitar and keyboard. The lead guitar offers many wonderful sharp screeches throughout the song that will kill little doggies. The overall atmosphere is somewhat laid back. This is the most evident in the instrumental break where one of the catchiest melodies lie. It's off to a full speed solo after that which transitions back into the catchy melody.   A keyboard intro that sounds like an instrument I have never heard opens "Alteration". There is another superb melody in the beginning of the song. The best part of this song is the instrumental break that takes one melody and repeats it in different ways that eventually leads into a great solo. The general atmosphere of the instrumental break is outright supernatural. Yet another wonderful song.   "Using the Word" starts out immediately after "Alteration". At first I thought they were one long song, but much to my surprise, they were two. The main lead gives a strong, triumphant feel. The keyboard adds in a harp melody that adds just the right flavour to this track. Another crafty instrumental break as both Kokko brothers offer a solo. Both are wonderfully done and add just the right atmosphere to the song. Great use of the whammy bar is also included. The track finishes strong and Pekka gives a nice ending to the album with a great raspy yell... then spits into the microphone.   However, there are some critical downsides in the production department. First of all, the bass drum can hardly be heard. The double bass drumming is great in "Evil in You", but it takes a lot of effort to hear it. Another problem is the keyboards are unnoticeable.  Kalmah 's music concentrates on the atmosphere and mood and the keyboard provides most of it. However, it is missing for large portions in most songs. It is only noticeable in the solos and in parts of "Evil in You" and "Using the Word", but just barely. And finally, the bass is non-existent. It simply cannot be heard in any of the songs, except for the intro of "Evil in You" and the interlude in "Hades".    Swampsong , musically, is a spectacular mix of driving rhythm guitar with elegant lead guitar. The mood and feeling is a concentrated theme that this band has to offer. If  Kalmah  can improve their production, perfection will be within reach.    Kalmah  -  Swamplord   Spikefarm (2001)  8 tracks (36:12)      Pekka Kokko: Vocals, Rhythm Guitar  Antti Kokko: Lead Guitar  Petri Sankala: Drums  Altti Vetelainen: Bass  Pasi Hiltula: Keyboards    Immortal Songs:  "Evil in You", "Heritance of Berija", "Alteration"   92 out of 100

      Ok, here's what happened:  I went to practice about 20 minutes late.  I had a few great bullet shots.  We played 5 v. 4 and I was on the shorthanded team again.  I gave an average performance, but managed to score a goal.  We played World Cup and I did OK.  I finally ate something at 16:00.  That's 4:00 PM if you don't speak European.  I had to run back out to an Italian meeting where I paid more money for the trips for my mum and dad.  I came home and ate my first meal (Big Mac meal) at 20:00.  That's 8:00 if you don't speak European.  I'm tired.  That's it.  Bye.

      Yesterday, (Tuesday) was a very busy day.  I was up at 08:00 when my mum came into my room and opened my windows and rearranged the stuff in my room.  That was a rather unpleasant way to get up, but I'm used to it.  All day after that we did stuff like decide what clothes to pack, gather stuff to take and argue about pointless stuff.  Our house has no air conditioning so I had to run out and get my dad from work and we were outfrom 17:30 to 20:00.  That's 5:30 to 8:00 PM if you don't speak European.  Soon after I ran back out with my mum to look for more clothes to take with us.  I didn't get back until 23:30.  That's 11:30 PM if you don't speak European.  That was it.  That was my day.  If I have time, I will make my next album review.  I will review  Kalmah 's  Swamplord .

      Today at Fedora Field, we played the crossbar game.  Not a lot of people made it out today so we played this time waster game.    The rules are:  1. Shoot from outside the 18-yard box.  2. Hit the crossbar. (hence the  Crossbar  Game)  3. Shoot the ball into the net.  4. Volleys are worth 2 points, one bouncers are worth one.  5. First to three wins cash money.  This game is quite difficult.  The hardest part is hitting the crossbar and hitting in a way that it bounces back to you and not straight down or not over the goal.  I was very unsuccessful for the first hour, but after some good coaching from Pat, I got the hang of it rather quickly and almost got two points.  Blasted headers.  If I could have volleyed it I would have had a sure two points.  Oh well, I was shut out.  Can't wait 'till the next practice on Wednesday.

      I am good.  I am damn good.  Usually I can't do two things at once, unless it is music related, but today, I managed to watch three entertaining sporting events at once and not miss anything.  First I woke up to watch the Men's French Open Final.  It was Gaston Gaudio v. Guillermo Coria for the coupe.  I started watching just after the third set.  Coria was two games away from the championship but Gaudio won three straight games to force a fourth set.  During the first game of the fourth set, Coria injured his left leg.  It was so bad he couldn't even run.  He just hobbled around trying to catch every ball that was hit to him, but couldn't catch most of them.  Coria gave away the fourth set to Gaudio.  The time it took Gaudio to win the fourth set was enough for Coria to recover from his injury.  He came back in the fifth set to reach championship point  three times .  However, Gaudio came back, won the game and tied up the fifth set 6-6.    It was time for breakfast so I had to leave this riveting match to eat an omlette.  When I got back, I turned on the telly just in time to see Gaudio smash a tremendous forehand past a frozen Coria to win the French Open.   After doing a bunch of stuff to get ready for my Italy trip, it was time to watch the NASCAR race from Dover.  My favourite driver, Tony Stewart, was ripping stuff up.  Later it was time to watch the New England Revolution v. Columbus Crew match online and the USA v. Japan women's international friendly.  I had the Crew v. Revs match on the computer and the race and USA v. Japan on split screen on the TV.  I was watching the race when I walked back to the computer just in time to see Frankie Hejduk score for Columbus.  One-nil Columbus.  After watching a little bit of the game, I changed the channel to the USA v. Japan game and I was just in time to watch a Japanese player score on a breakaway.  One-nil Japan.  I went back to watching more of the Crew v. Revs game when I tuned in to the race.  I was just in time to witness a big ass crash.  About 20 cars piled up in turn 4.    I went back to the Revs v. Crew match, A PENALTY!!!  Hejduk cut down Steve Ralston in the box.  Jose Cancela chipped a shot and made Crew 'keeper Jon Busch dive the wrong way.  1-1.  Back to the USA v. Japan match and someone from the USA scored.  I think it was Abby Wambach, but I cannot be sure. 1-1.  Back to the Crew v. Revs match for ANOTHER PENALTY!!!  Jeff Cunningham got tripped in the box, got up, and buried the penalty to give the Crew a 2-1 lead.  Pat told me that the Cubs were about to win.  I switched over to the Cubs v. Pirates game to watch the last out.  Cubs won 4-1.  I switched back to racing in time for the green flag.  After a few laps of racing, Casey Mears blew an engine spilling oil on the track.  No caution.   A lap later, Kasey Kahne, in first place with 20 laps to go and pulling away, slipped on the oil, smashed into the wall and took about five other cars with him.  I was helping my mum cook dinner when it was time for my break.  I was just in time to see Mark Martin win and Tony Stewart finish second.  I went back to the USA v. Japan match.  The final whistle blew and the match ended 1-1.  I walked back to the computer to see a THIRD PENALTY!!!  In the second minute of stoppage time, the Revolution had a chance to tie the game up.  Cancela chipped the ball on goal again, but Busch was too smart and tipped the shot over the crossbar to give the Columbus Crew a 2-1 win.  My timing was spot on all day.  I am a lucky bastard.  Practice tomorrow on Fedora Field.  Full report tomorrow.  See y'all.

      I hate VH1.  I hate ESPN.  Here I am at the computer listening to  Damnation and a Day  (I seriously can't stop listening to it) and I am watching VH1's countdown of the "Most Metal Moments".  This has to be the most abhorrent countdown of "metal" I have ever seen.  There has been countless mentions of bands that I would never (and will never) think of as metal.   Motley Crue  is not metal.   Poison  is not metal.   Bon Jovi  is not metal.   Def Leppard  is not metal. (Although the drummer does deserve some credit for losing his arm and coming back to play again)   Stryper  sure as Hades is not metal.  Bands that dress up like women with make-up and teased hair and wear multi-coloured spandex   ARE NOT METAL!   They sing little girly songs with flashy pyro and dancers and little girls in the crowd ogling over them.  They play music that retarded monkeys could play.  The singing sounds like a squirrel who got his testicles caught on a fence.  Yet VH1 still decides to kiss ass and mention these soulless, tasteless wannabes as metal gods.  Metal Gods?   Slayer  are metal Gods   Anthrax  are metal Gods   Pantera  are metal Gods   Exodus  are metal Gods   Megadeth  are metal Gods   Motorhead  are metal Gods  A  Slayer  fan takes a knife and carves "SLAYER" in both of his forearms.  That's metal.   Pantera 's "House of Shock" is metal.   Anthrax  making an MTV appearance and trashes a fan's house is metal.   Gwar  getting in trouble for their bloody stage show is metal... well... sort of.  All of these are very notable metal moments.  However, VH1 had to include at least 10 entries about groupies alone.  I hate to say it, but groupies are not metal.  Any musician will at some point or another get a bunch of groupies. (the exception being  Clay Aiken )   Other entries that did not make sense at all were:   Poison  revolutionise information maitenance system with groupie database.    Ace Frehley claims he was abducted by aliens. (that is not metal, that is just pure lunacy)    Bon Jovi  marks the beginning of hair metal. (in my opinion the darkest day in metal history)   Poison 's C.C. Deville goes throws a fit at the VMA's.     Poison  screen potential groupies with a video camera.     Motley Crue 's Nikki Sixx and Tommy Lee compete in a Stink and Scorefest. (a man named Nikki is not metal)    Motley Crue  making fans pee in a kitty litter box to meet them backstage.    Nikki Sixx sets himself on fire.    Here's the worst one:  Motley Crue 's Tommy Lee steers boat without using hands.  YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!!   That  is the #21 top metal moment?  I drive with out using my hands when I'm on the phone or when I'm changing the radio station or when I am trying to reach in my bookbag for a CD to put in.  Is that metal?  No, that's just me stupidly endangering my life because I am trying to do too many things at once.  As a true metal fan, that countdown sickened me.  I am tired of the old people at VH1 thinking they know everything about metal, having a countdown, and loading it up with washed up hair metal bands.  That's why I fully endorse the upstart music channel Fuse.  They are primarily a rock channel, but when they do metal, they do it damn well.  Their metal show "Uranium" is hosted by the beautiful and very metal Juliya Chernetsky.  This show plays balls out metal all the time.  You will see the bands appear on "Uranium" nowhere else .  When was the last time you saw  Children of Bodom  on VH1?  My point exactly.  The lovely metal goddess: Juliya    So after a while of watching that disgrace to metal, I went to Mickey D's to get food for me, my mum, my dad, my cousin, and my aunt.  I went up to the cashier (who was  very  hot) and ordered four salads, a happy meal, a #3, and a double cheeseburger.  So I was getting my drink and when I got back, I saw a huge ass bag and the happy meal and I thought that everything was there so I took it and left.  I felt like an idiot b/c I was struggling to carry all of that out.  I got home and discovered that the only thing in the huge ass bag were two salads.  So I had to go back, get the two other salads which were in another huge ass bag, the #3, and the double cheeseburger.  The cashier must have recognised me b/c she immediately said you forgot something.  I replied bashfully, yeah, I know.  So after sorting the whole mess out with the manager, I got my food and took off, but not before I thanked the cashier again.  She smiled and replied, no problem.  Oh yeah, she wants me. ;)  So I went home and ate my first meal of the day.  It was 14:45.  That's 2:45 PM if you don't speak European.  I was in a great mood.  I got McDonalds, flirted with the hot cashier, and in 15 minutes, the Fire game was going to come on.  I was enjoying the game when around the 38th minute ESPN commentator Rob Stone stopped his colour commentary to say that ESPN 2 was moving coverage to WNBA Basketball and the Fire game can be seen in its entirety later tonight.  I was absolutely livid!  Why did we have to get bumped off of the air for WOMEN'S BASKETBALL?!?!  And what caused this happen?  Well, President Reagan died, so I understood why ABC went to Breaking News coverage, but I was  insulted  by the fact that MLS got pre-empted by the WNBA.  I mean, I understand that the WNBA is a new league and they are trying just as hard as MLS to get attention, but what bites my bum is the fact that they get ABC airtime on a silver platter while we get cheap ESPN 2 airtime that is often taken away from us by tennis and the Little League World Series, and now women's basketball.  It really really sucks being a soccer fan in America.  If we were in Europe, a nuclear war wouldn't cut into a soccer match.  That's why I can't wait to get to Italy.  They are as passionate as I am about soccer.  I doubt they even care women play basketball.  I doubt they even  know  women play basketball.  Well I'm off to watch the Fire game on tape delay.  As for you ESPN, I guarantee a venomous e-mail is coming your way.  Especially now that you got the Metrostars v. Dallas score on your sports ticker thing wrong.  Dallas won 2-0 not 3-0.  You are totally soccer inept.  I can't wait to get my degree in statistics and flood your sports ticker with soccer stats from Botswana.  Then you will pay for your injustices against the beautiful game.   Bwaaa hahahaha!!!

      So I woke up today at the ass-crack of 11:00 and I had to go with my sis to get the car from the school that my mum works at and the car that my dad leaves at the train station.  By the time that was done, it was time for lunch.  So I went to Subway and got a... I forgot and went to eat it in the car while I listened to the album rated 100/100 by me,  Damnation and a Day . (read yesterday's review if you haven't already)  After I ate, I still had another hour to burn.  So I called up my buddy Steve (go visit his blog) and I went to his house.  We looked at funny stuff online and chatted about stuff.  I saw this hilarious video of this guy who seems to think he is a Swedish version of that "Rico Suave" guy.  The line this guy uses is something like, "Ooooh, you touch my tralala, my ding ding dong".  It is so cheesy and hilarious.  Here's the link to it right here:   urlLink Tralala, Ding Ding Dong    After my wonderful visit at Stephen's house, it was off to soccer practice.  At first we didn't do much.  We just took shots on goal.  My left footed shot has worsened dramatically.  I was almost happy with it, but after today's performance I realised it still needs lots of work.  My right footed shots weren't too great either, but I am doing better with my power shots.  We then went on a long run.  I am somewhat pleased with my performance.  My legs held up very well, thanks to my 45 minute exercise chair workouts, I wasn't out of breath, which is another improvement, but my heart could not take the running at all.  That was my weak point.  If you know of any cardiovascular exercises that will improve stamina, I would like to know what they are.  (I know what is the first thing you all are going to say, but that won't work b/c I don't have a girlfriend)  After the run, it was time for a 6 v. 5 match.  I was on the team with five players and I think my performance suffered on account of that.  I could not find anyone to pass to, so I was making ill-advised passes.  The rest of the match, I was an absolute non-factor.  After we lost it was time for a desperately needed break.    We played juniors v. seniors and us seniors enjoyed most of the possession.  This game was tremendously better for me.  Towards the beginning I decided to do away with the ponytail.  It may have helped.  I began to make good passes and good decisions.  Maybe it was the teammates that were making me better, but I also felt a lot more energised, a lot more confident, and a lot more in pain.  My hip flexor is a problem that is not going away.  I made a plethora of good passes, almost good passes, a few good shots, one goal, and one great run up the middle beating the entire junior team and getting my shot blocked.  After that, the confidence shot straight up.  My defending became better, my aggression became more intense, I could read the game better, I made great supporting runs, my first touch was coming with ease, and I seemed to have endless amounts of energy.  I felt like that was one of my best performances in a very long time.    Sometimes I play like absolute excrement (the first game) and sometimes I can surprise everyone and play extremely well. (the second game)  I just hope that when tryouts come in August I can play extremely well.  If I do, I just might have a slight chance of making the team.    During the long run and the first game, I realised I will most likely not make the team at all.  I barely did last year and there is so much good talent coming up from last year's sophomore and freshman team and even the eighth graders are going to advance up to varsity.  Only five seniors graduated so with so much talent coming in and so little going out, I fear that cuts will be made.  It will be a major disappointment if I fail to make the team since it is my last year and I have not lived up to my expectations for the last six years.  But it's also not fair if a freshman is better than me and he gets sent down just so I can stay on the team.  I'll leave that decision to my coach Alan.  But the second game gave me hope that I can overcome all odds.  If I attend the soccer camp and play a lot over the summer, maybe that will show Alan that I have the dedication to make the varsity team.  I am already starting to get ready for next year.  I just need to remember this second game and how well I played.  That will allow me to desperately cling on the hope I have for next season.  That will give me the confidence I desperately need to play at my highest level.  I will not back down.  I will not give up yet.

      Usually when a band makes a record they write about 10 to 12 songs and put them on an album.  Usually the entire CD is anywhere from 45 to 60 minutes long.  Usually songs are conveniently placed in 3 minute boxes ready to be consumed by the audience.  Usually there are three or four stand out songs and the rest are album fillers.  Usually they are separate songs that don't correlate to each other.    Usually.     Cradle of Filth  destroys that mold with their latest album  Damnation and a Day .  First off, there are 17 tracks on this album.  True some of them are symphonic bridges between songs (more on this later) but the album would be seriously lacking if it weren't for them.  Secondly, these 17 songs take over 76 minutes to play out.  Third, most songs are well over five minutes long, some over six.  Next, every song is just as intense, just as brutal as the previous.  There is never a let down.  And finally and most importantly, this album tells a story.  Each song has a theme and it rolls into the next song much like an epic movie.  Story?  What the hell is this?  What kind of album has a story?  Well, be prepared for something new.   Damnation and a Day  takes on the story of the war between good and evil from the evil (obviously) perspective.  (I must warn you that you really need to know the characters and the stories in the Bible to follow this album's theme)  There are four main chapters:  Fantasia Down, Paradise Lost, Sewer Side Up,  and  The Scented Garden .  Each chapter begins with an orchestral track complete with a 40 piece symphony and 30 choir singers which introduce a new theme in the battle between good and evil.  In a few of these orchestral songs, there is a little narration to set up the stage for the new chapter.  The chapter opens with "A Bruise Upon the Silent Moon" introduces the theme of Lucifer's fall from Heaven's angel to ruler of Hell. (this is the  Fantasia Down  chapter)  "Damned in Any Language (A Plague on Words)" opens the theme of temptation of sin upon humans. (this is the  Paradise Lost  chapter)  "The Mordant Liquor of Tears" displays evils throughout mankind, (this is the  Sewer Side Up  chapter) but also foreshadows the next theme.  "A Scarlet Witch Lit the Season" projects - get this - a love story.  Yes, a love story. (this is  The Scented Garden  chapter)  And so it begins.   Cradle  kicks in.  And they kick hard! "The Promise of Fever" is an unforgiving song that assaults the ears and never lets up.  Lead singer Dani Filth's screams and howls highlight this ominous track.  There is a part where the orchestra builds the energy to a climax and Dani's howl pierces through to bring on the ending assault.  The next song is "Hurt and Virtue".  This track has a very catchy guitar riff that is one of the best on the entire album.  It speeds by until the end where is slows slightly and leads to a dramatic end.  "An Enemy Led the Tempest" has another wonderful guitar riff that blends in wonderfully with the keyboards and the opera singers.  The track changes tempo during the middle, but breaks out to full speed again before the sorrowful agonising ending.  "Better to Reign in Hell" is a track with more brutal guitar that switches to elegant very quickly... Then back to brutal again.  This track also features female backing vocals that adds a hint of eerieness and a 45 second instrumental that is top notch.  "Serpent Tongue" starts with haunting drums and keyboards which enters again in the middle and end of the song.  Dani's whispers are extremely chilling.  "Carrion" sounds alot like a  Slayer  song with an orchestra, opera singers, and piercing screams and howls in the background.  There is another part where Dani whispers scripture and when you least expect it,  Cradle   bursts out in full fury.  "Present from the Poison Hearted" features another excellent guitar riff.  The keyboards are especially chilling in this track.  Dani features great mouth control when he lists names the Devil corrupted rapid-fire.  I mean, any one who can accurately and clearly say Mahalaleel super fast deserves some credit.  The middle part has a relaxing orchestra part that is eventually raped by Dani's howls and the band's brutal playing.  "Doberman (Pharaoh)" starts out with a sitar.  A crushing guitar riff follows with a female voice harmonising with the guitar riff.  Orchestral breaks with Dani's low gravely chants are dispersed throughout this track.  The sitar makes another cameo near the end and the keyboard makes itself known.  "Babalon A.D. (So Glad For the Madness)" is the adjoining song between the  Sewer Side Up  chapter and the  Scented Garden  chapter.  This song starts out crushing, then goes off to another eerie moment before embarking on another ultra-catchy guitar riff.  Then it sounds a little hypnotic until it goes onto the eerie again.  After a while, there is a nifty little jam before the catchy riff again.  Towards the end, the song stops completely and the only thing that is heard is a heartbeat for about a second before the band kicks in again.  This part scares the feces out of me every time.  Next is "Mannequin".  I have heard this song a few times before, but never the whole thing so I kind of knew what to expect.  The video is... strange (of course) but that's not the point.  I never knew what the hell Dani was singing about until I read the lyrics in the book and thought about how it correlates to the theme of the album.  It all makes sense now.  Anyway, this song has one of my favourite guitar riffs on the album and has lovely female backing vocals.  This song has an excellent atmosphere and that is what  Cradle of Filth  is all about.  Song number 15 is "Thank God for the Suffering".  This is one of my favourite songs on the entire album.  Strangely enough it's a love song and quite possibly the closest  Cradle  will ever come to an all out ballad.  It's a great dynamic from the previous songs about sin, Hell, and slaughter.  It's cold, sorrowful, and eerie.  This is the turning point of the theme of the album.  I don't want to give too much away, but this is really the crowning point.  The absolute best part is at the very end where there is chanting which abruptly stops leaving Dani to whisper in the most haunting voice "I thank God for the suffering".  Immediately after "The Smoke of Her Burning" starts and it is a neck breaking change of tempo.  As the last real song on the album this is naturally the final battle between good and evil.  I don't understand how Paul, the guitarist, did not break his wrist off from playing so fast.  He really has to be playing about a million notes per second.  This is also another memorable guitar riff. (how many is that?)  Towards the end, the song slows from the mindblowing speed and produces one of my favourite line of lyrics ever: "Weld the gates to Heaven shut/ The abyss leers in hissing ruts/ Unhilt the black grimoire of death/ Inscribe all names God has left."  The band fades out, thunder rolls, the orchestra plays with a sorrowful tone, and the choir sings ominously.  The final track "End of Daze" enters and it closes with thunder, wind howling, and the last narration with evil laughter that fades away and brings this epic album to an end.  The only thing I neglected to talk about is the drumming.  Adrian puts together the performance of his life.  The double bass pounding is consistent and the snare sounds like a machine gun. (listen to "Mannequin" for an example)  He uses the ride cymbal, high hat, and crashes appropriately so they each add different characteristics to a song.  And I will never know how Dani can change his voice from glass shattering high to ground shaking low so quickly.  You may not like the style of singing, but it is amazing how seamlessly he goes back and forth.  Some people may say this is not music.  Well they are right.  It is something so much more.  It truly is an epic.   Cradle  certainly had lots of balls to try and make an album like this.  Concept albums usually don't work, but they made it perfect.  The story alone is very intriguing.  Each song is excellent when listened to on their own, but they are only fully appreciated when they are listened to completely all the way through in the wee hours of the night while reading the lyrics.   Damnation and a Day  has raised the bar of heavy metal to dizzying heights.  Maybe the only way this album can be topped is by  Cradle of Filth  themselves.   Cradle of Filth  -  Damnation and a Day   Sony Music (2003) 17 tracks (76:53)    Dani "Filth" Davey: Vocals Paul Allender: Guitar Adrian Erlandsson: Drums Dave Pybus: Bass   Immortal songs:  "Hurt and Virtue", "Better to Reign in Hell", "Thank God for the Suffering", "The Scent of Her Burning"  100 out of 100.

      I know I was supposed to give you the  Damnation and a Day  review for you all today, but I want one more day to listen to the whole thing continuously.  That's the key word: continuously.  Don't know what I mean?  You will.  I voted for the MLS All-Star game yesterday.  This format foreshadows a match between the MLS All-Stars and the most famous soccer club in the world Real Madrid.  The sad part is many Americans know more Real Madrid players (David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Luis Figo, Raul, Zinedine Zidane) than MLS All-Stars.  However, Real Madrid scheduled a Japanese tour that will clash with the All-Star game.  What will happen?  Stay tuned to find out.  Anyway, I still voted for the MLS All-Star team and this is who I cast my vote for:  Goalkeepers (2): Henry Ring (CHI), Kevin Hartman (LA)  Both ‘keepers have done outstanding for their team this season.  Who would have thought the Fire had an All-Star sitting on the bench for two years while Zach Thornton dominated the ‘keeper position.  Defenders (5): Jim Curtin (CHI), Kelly Gray (CHI), Frankie Hejduk (CLB), Cory Gibbs (DAL),  Jeff Agoos (SJ)  It was hard only picking five.  I chose Jim Curtin because he is the most underrated player in MLS and has been huge in the Fire’s defensive success so far this season.  I chose Kelly Gray because he is my favourite Fire player, and I chose Frankie Hejduk because he is a great defender, but also gets into the attack very well and has outstanding speed.  Gibbs deserves an All-Star spot because he has been solid all season, and Agoos’s veteranship will be great against a team like Real Madrid.  Midfielders (5): Chris Armas (CHI), DaMarcus Beasley (CHI), Landon Donovan (SJ), Andreas Herzog (LA), Cobi Jones (LA)  This may not be a very good midfield.  True, it is loaded with outstanding players, but it won’t work because there are way too many attacking midfielders.  Donovan, Jones and Herzog are all mainly attacking, Beasley’s main job with the Fire is to support the attack, and Armas can’t stop Real Madrid all on his own.  I would probably put Herzog as the only attacking midfielder because his play this season has been simply outstanding.  His crosses, passes, and vision are second to none.  I cannot stress enough how wonderful Herzog has been this season.  As for Donovan, I hate him, but you cannot deny his wonderful play.  Cobi Jones is getting up there in age so if I have to leave one out, I would leave him out even though he is one of my favourite players.  Forwards (4): Ante Razov (CHI), Brian Ching (SJ), Jovan Kirovski (LA), Carlos Ruiz (LA)  The only one out of these four that will definitely be on the line up is Kirovski.  Ruiz has injury problems, Ching may not get enough votes because he is another one that is underrated, and Razov has been cold most of the season, and anyone not living in Chicago hates him passionately.  Kirovski has been outstanding this year showing why he needs to be considered for the U.S. National Team.  However, four of his five goals have been scored against the Dallas Burn so he may have that going against him.  If Ruiz is healthy, there is no question he will find an All-Star spot.   You can vote for you MLS All-Stars here:   urlLink Vote for your MLS All-Stars!!!    That's it for now, I'll get you the  Damnation and a Day  album review tomorrow.  See y'all.

      Section 8.  The home of the best, most loyal, most passionate soccer fans in the United States of America.  Section 8 also gets help from fellow Fire fan groups like the Barnburners, the Arsonists, and the Ultras, but usually there are a little - no - alot more than 9,000 of us at Fire games.  C'mon people, we symbolise what the future of Major League Soccer is about.  Thousands of fans packing a stadium supporting the best sport in the world by cheering, singing, banging drums, and cursing out the other team and officials.  All of this energy we generate goes to the team we are supporting leading them to reward us with goals, saves, and wins.  However the attendance numbers this year have been a joke.  Four games played, all of them with less than 13,000 fans.  I'll be straightforward here.  That is shit.  I mean no wonder why the Fire lost two of their first three games at home.  No support at all.  That 3-1 home loss to Columbus was the most disgraceful loss I have seen them play and it was also the smallest, tamest, crowd I have ever seen at home.  Other teams fear us, but if we keep getting such lowly attendance numbers the home field advantage will wear away.  This Saturday Freddy Adu will arrive into town so the numbers at the game should soar, but I would hate to think that so many people are attending this game to watch someone from the other team rather than our team.  So I say to you go out and watch the Fire game at Soldier Field.  Go out and watch Freddy.  But remember why you are actually going out in the first place: to watch the Fire win, to cheer them on, and to watch the beautiful game.  Another thing that I am pissed about.  Chivas USA.  For those of you who don't know, Chivas USA is close to becoming the next expansion team to enter MLS.  That's cool, but the problem is the owner of Chivas USA is none other than Jose Vergara, owner of Chivas CD.  Chivas CD is a Mexican soccer club that has an outstanding history behind them.  Every player to play on Chivas all time has been of Mexican descent.  This is all good, but Mr. Vergara wants MLS to lift their restriction of three foreign players per team just for him so he can field an all-Mexican team -  IN AN AMERICAN LEAGUE .  That's not going to work buddy.  I don't even know why Vergara wants a club in the United States as it is.  When it comes to soccer, America is Mexico's worst enemy (whether they admit it or not) so why is he trying to help MLS with his investments?  I think if his club is successful, he will make it look like MLS is a joke of a league, if Chivas is not successful, he will turn around and say the League treated him unfairly or some crap like that.    CHIVAS SHOULD NOT BE IN MLS!!   And as if that is not enough, Vergara wants his team placed in a city that 1) already has an MLS team in it and 2) already has (or has plans for) a much envied "soccer specific stadium".  He wants to go to Los Angeles so he can leech off of the Galaxy's newly constructed Home Depot Center or - get this - he wants Chivas USA to call  CHICAGO  home.   OF ALL BLOODY PLACES!!!   Do you believe this?!?!  This guy has the balls to come into a hostile country, put a team in their league, want rules to be broken to satisfy his desires, and request that his team share a world class field that he did not invest a goddamn penny in.  Buddy, if you want to stick your foot in the door of my team's stadium and request to share it with us, I will rip the boot off of your foot  AND SHOVE IT STRAIGHT UP YOUR ASS!!!   You are going to take the hispanic fans attending Fire games and build your club with their image so they will go to your team.  Hell no buddy.  And Peter Wilt (general manager of the Fire) what the hell is your problem?  You are encouraging the enemy into our town and taking our fans to move into our stadium that we are paying for?  I hope you are just talking out of your ass b/c if you are really serious about welcoming Chivas you are seriously an idiot.  And if you aren't talking out of your ass, be a man and tell Vergara to go do something unpleasant to himself.  Don't make your fans do it for you.  MLS, if you want a city worth expanding for, promote the Rochester Raging Rhinos from the A-League to MLS.  They have everything you want.  1) soccer specific stadium [that is expandable mind you] 2) a good team, [this team beat the Fire in an Open Cup match two years ago, they are for real] 3) a dedicated town, owners, and fans.  In fact Rochester may have the second best soccer fans in the country. (Only behind the Fire fans when they feel like showing up)  This is so obvious.  Take Rochester, screw Chivas.  Do the right thing for American soccer.  Tomorrow I will talk about my MLS All-Star team and I will give my first album review.  I bought  Cradle of Filth 's  Damnation and a Day  and I will give a review of that tomorrow.  Until then, see ya.

        Editor's Note:&nbsp; Obviously, this did not just happen.&nbsp; I am desperately behind schedule on my posts.&nbsp; Just be patient and I will do the best I can.&nbsp; These are immensely long posts.      &nbsp;   Today, I went with my sister, her boyfriend, his brother, and two of their friends to see NASCAR Busch Series and Nextel Cup Qualifying. We got to the parking lot, which was a giant field and walked all the way around the track to the entrance. We could hear each car go by as they did their qualifying laps. We got in and looked at the sky and knew we were screwed. Dark black clouds and green clouds hung over our heads ominously. We got seats and sat down to watch two cars qualify. Then a giant Tropicana blow-up orange broke loose and ran a qualifying lap of its own. A safety truck tried to corner it, but the runaway orange rolled right over it. When the orange crossed the finish line, the crowd cheered. The orange finally got hung up in the safety fence in turn one. It was popped, but still stuck to the fence. The safety crew finally got the orange off the fence when the first raindrops pelted the track... then poured. We ran under the grandstands and stood in a little dry rectangle. After the it rained for an hour and the crew dried the track for another hour and a half, it was time to continue qualifying! I got up close to the fence to take pictures of Kasey Kahne's car and Tony Stewart's car. I will post them later when they get developed.   Back to the Italian madness:      The alarm rang at 03:15. Or somewhere around there. It was too damn early, let me just say that. Anyway, I got dressed, put contacts in, got everything I needed for the three hour bus ride in my bag, and was ready for take off. Werner and I got to the coach bus around 3:45 so we were early. We were waiting for 10 minutes after our scheduled depart time when Eric, Alan, and Pietro arrived fashionably late. After that, everyone was aboard so it was off to the Vatican.   The five hooligans (Me, Tim, Eric, Anthony, and Robert) sat in the five-seat backseat on the bus. Occasionally, Beatrice would come by and sandwich herself between Eric and me. We talked most of the way there about random stuff while looking through Robert's Italian dictionary for off the wall phrases and obscene words.&nbsp; For example, we learned how to communicate with animals from that book.&nbsp; Then someone took it a step further and called me "assholeballs" in Italian.&nbsp; How do you mess that up?&nbsp; Then Tim remarked that the Pope's home should be renamed "Pope-al Stadium".&nbsp;   Yeah, that made no sense either. &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Eventually we got to the Vatican.&nbsp; We got out and climbed down an eternity of stairs and there we were.&nbsp; We were at Pope-al Stadium. &nbsp;    &nbsp;   We got inside and found our seats.&nbsp; Originally, this was only supposed to be a private gathering with us and about 200 other people, but somehow, over 1,000 people were in attendance.&nbsp; They were groups of people from all over the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe the entire... ceremony I guess one can call it... was delivered in five languages. (English, Italian, German, Spanish, French)&nbsp; The Pope made his way out and everyone took a bunch of pictures.&nbsp; Here's something that bothered me:&nbsp; it was over 90 degrees, the Pope almost 90 years old, and he is in bad health so why is he in layers of heavy polyester robes and gowns?&nbsp; That's not smart if you ask me.&nbsp; Here's something else that is on my mind:&nbsp; why is it that the holier the place I go, the more morbid my inner thoughts become?&nbsp; Why was I hoping for the Pope to suddenly croak?&nbsp; Why was I hoping for some strange little catastrophe to happen?&nbsp; Why was I booing everyone else when their respective group was called out?&nbsp; Oh well, I'm going to Hell. &nbsp;    &nbsp;   After the Pope's little ordeal was mercifully over, it was time to go... somewhere else.&nbsp; Oh yeah, we were supposed to go to the Sistine Chapel, but for some unknown reason we couldn't.&nbsp; So for the next two hours we wandered about eating our packed lunch, going out into the town square for a drink and gelato and just chillin'.&nbsp; While we were chillin', Tim made a bet with me that Eric was about to "get some" on the trip.&nbsp; I set the wager at $5 and counted down the days until payday.&nbsp; I was sure I was going to win.&nbsp; Later, I ordered myself a gelato with ease and looked at a little shop that was selling cheap knock off jerseys of famous soccer players. &nbsp;  &nbsp;   We eventually had to gather again to go.&nbsp; So we all went&nbsp;to walk to the bus.&nbsp; The walk was uphill on a narrow sidewalk.&nbsp; That's a stressful walk when the group is over 60 people large.&nbsp; We made it after about 20 minutes and I thought that it was finally time to escape the heat and make it back on the bus... I was incredibly wrong.&nbsp; It was time to go into... someother holy building and look around.&nbsp; We had to split up into two separate groups because our group was so large. &nbsp;    &nbsp;   We got to the end of that so I decided to get an early jump on everyone and I left with Matteo, Ulderico, and Anthony.&nbsp; We would eventually run into Alan, Eric, and Bea.&nbsp; We got to the exit, but to our surprise, no one else was there.&nbsp; We sat around at a gift shop like the tour guide said and waited for about 15 minutes when we decided we should try and find everyone else.&nbsp; Reluctantly, we got up and tried different exits of where everyone else might have been.&nbsp; Luckily, Matteo had his mobile and he called Werner who was sitting comfortably on the bus.&nbsp; Matteo decided we all should walk back to the bus to be safe.&nbsp; We were walking back when Alan ran into some of his old Italian friends.&nbsp; He stopped to talk with them for a minute or two and brought them with us to our trek back to the bus.&nbsp; We happened to run into a few of the&nbsp;chaperones on the way back and they decided to go with us back to the bus.&nbsp; We were on the same path we went on to the entrance and were almost done when we saw the whole group we lost rushing in the opposite way.&nbsp; Extremely frustrated that we made the long trip in vain, we went back to go into the Sistine Chapel, the same chapel we were denied access to in the first place.       We hauled ass and followed everyone to the entrance to the Sistine Chapel... which was a few feet from where we were in the first place!&nbsp; We rushed through security, the chapel, and all of the stuff inside.&nbsp; I touched the famous foot of St. Peter for good luck.&nbsp; I think it is supposed to bring good luck.&nbsp; After that, we left for the bus.      The walk back to the bus took an eternity.&nbsp; It was hot and we walked uphill most of the way.&nbsp; We finally got to the bus and everyone filed in.&nbsp; We were waiting for about another 20 minutes because Alan was missing.&nbsp; The tour guide got on the microphone and made a remark about us being behind schedule because we were wasting time.&nbsp; Wasting time?&nbsp; They were the ones who&nbsp;made us sit around for two hours because they wouldn't let us in the Sistine Chapel and they want to complain to us?&nbsp; Piss off.      Alan finally made his way to the bus and was unjustly disciplined for losing his way.&nbsp; We headed for home, but first made a quick drive by the Colisseum.&nbsp; Towards the end of the bus ride, Werner, Matteo, and Bea started a raucous rendition of the Italian National Anthem and other Italian songs.&nbsp; Frankly, I enjoyed it.&nbsp; But then, a few American girls started the worst rendition of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" in the history of man.&nbsp; Even worse than Mike Ditka.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; That bad.      We finally made it home and it was time for the first good news of the trip: THE LUGGAGE ARRIVED!!!!&nbsp; Most of it at least.&nbsp; There were a few pieces missing and it was reported that some of the suitcases were destroyed.&nbsp; We got to the Hotel Arlecchino was told that the luggage was at the Hotel Progresso.&nbsp; We got there and searched for our luggage.&nbsp; We found most of it.&nbsp; My mum's suitcase was wrapped in packaging tape.&nbsp; My dad's suitcase had the zipper ripped off and gouges on the outside.&nbsp; My suitcase had a huge rip in the side of it and several scratches on the surface.&nbsp; I couldn't wait to get home and see if anything was missing.&nbsp; As long as my soccer shoes are in there, I would be OK.      But first, I was starving so we made a quick jaunt to a nearby McDonald's.&nbsp; I was really interested to notice the difference between Italian McDonald's and American McDonald's.&nbsp; I ordered a Big Mac and noticed that it was not as greasy as the American version and the bread was somewhat stale.&nbsp; The meat tasted better and the secret sauce was a little bit sweeter.&nbsp; I heard from people that the fries were alot better because they had olive oil on them.&nbsp; I think I like them the same.      I opened up my suitcase to discover that half of what I packed was gone.&nbsp; Two new pairs of shorts were gone.&nbsp; My shaving kit was gone.&nbsp; A shirt was gone.&nbsp; But worst of all, those bastards at the airline STOLE MY SOCCER BOOTS!!!  (Long obscene rant deleted)        Angry, I got ready for bed and went to sleep.&nbsp; Those bastards will rue the day...     Day 5 later.&nbsp; I will also&nbsp;add pictures once I finally learn how.

      On with Italy...    Day 3 was a blur. I woke up past 11:00 and just sat on the bed in a tired daze. I don't really remember anything. I was so tired I probably slept all day. I do remember going to bed real early. The next day was a big day. It was the trip to Rome.    The Rome trip later.

      So we continue the trip to Italy...   So there we are.  Weary and restless we file out of the plane.  We board a shuttle to take us to the terminal (I think that's what they call it) where we rode on the left side of the road.  That was quite strange.  So we got to the terminal.  I had to piss like nothing else.  After an eternity of walking and climbing stairs, I finally take a whiz.  After that it was time that time again... AIRPORT FOOTBALL!!!!  I dribbled around a bit b/c no one wanted to play.  Their loss.  Then I stumbled across a couple of errant English newspapers.  I turned right to the sports section to read four whole pages about England's chances in Euro 2004.  At this point I knew England were destined for disappointment.  After more waiting and more walking and more... nothingness, it was time to board the plane to Rome.  We got on and fought with another member of our group for a seat and I prevailed.  After that, we ate and I slept for about a good two hours.  When I awoke, I was pleasantly greeted by beautiful scenery.  We flew over France and the Alps in Switzerland and northern Italy and we flew over endless green fields.  It was a wonderful sight.  We got to the airport and I was glad to see signs in both Italian and English.  I told the elder Pascarella, Stephanie, that I hoped all signs would be in both Italian and English.  I would be mighty disappointed.  It was time to go to the baggage claim.  We waited for our baggage... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... then played some airport calcio... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited until we said "screw it, let's go to our homes and have someone drive them to the hotels".  The hotels were where the chaperones were staying.  I was all for the idea of leaving a long ass time ago because I wanted to get home and watch Italy vs. Denmark.  So we got on a coach bus (last year in America all of the trips were on school busses) and began the three hour trek from Rome to San Benedetto del Tronto.  Tim was the genius who decided to bring his portable DVD player so we watched  Eurotrip.    Eurotrip  was pretty funny.  The moron guy was hilarious and it was especially funny when the dweeb guy was the only one to get some kind of action if you know what I mean.  And the song "Scotty Doesn't Know" is an instant classic.  And the Manchester United hooligans were hilarious too.  And have you ever been to Bratislava?  Good times.  We stopped at a gas station for snacks.  I walked in and stood in an aisle blocking everyone because Sweden vs. Bulgaria was on.  At the time Sweden was winning, by how much I'm not sure, but they were winning.  I bought pizza and realised how much of a problem the language barrier is.  It was quite strange.  And very uncomfortable.  Especially when the waitress out of nowhere started to speak English.  I was totally off guard.  It was time to go back to the bus.  We rode the bus for an eternity in the dark.  It was silent.  I think every one was asleep.  I fell asleep for about 20 minutes and awoke to find myself drooling on my shoulder.  Yeah, it was a good thing everyone was asleep so they didn't see that.  After 24 hours of travelling, we finally... FINALLY reached the Hotel Arlecchino.  It was so great to see everyone again.  Werner, Mario, Beatrice, Ulderico, Alessio, Mattio, Alessandra (all of them), Pietro, Maria and everyone else from last year.  Werner rushed up to me and we gave each other a welcoming hug.  I tried to point Tim to Alessio and his family, but then I say Bea and we gave each other a huge giant mega hug.  It was wonderful to see her again.  And she was cute as always.  Her hair was down to the bottom of her ear which is alot longer than last year.  I really liked it.  I met Werner's family and introduced them to my parents.  We went to the hotel and got the key for my mum and dad.  I left with Werner's family to go and get some pizza.  I had the Margherita pizza which is a very thin, chewy crust with a layer of crushed tomato and cheese.  Yeah, a little bland.  So we sat and talked about the flight and the missing luggage and how Italy can't do a damn thing in international competitions because Giovanni Trapattoni sucks as a coach.  Italy played an uninspired match with Denmark and drew 0-0.  I was tired so it was time we went home and went to bed.  From the time I walked into the house, I felt incredibly comfortable... and tired.  I took out my contacts, got into bed, and fell asleep.   Day 3 later.

      Today and yesterday I had stomach problems.  Not the I-feel-like-I-have-to-vomit feeling.  Not the I-feel-like-I-got-punched-in-the-stomach feeling.

Y'know that feeling?  Anyways, this is the part of the blog where I post something about my Italy trip.  We will go back to the first day: 13 June, 2004 and relive the randimosity.  Off we go:   So it begins.  All of the endless preparation for the past two weeks will finally pay off.    I got up and was prepared for the huge event... USA vs. Grenada in World Cup Qualifying of course!  This should have been a great match to watch because the Americans should dominate the Grenadians by at least 7 goals, but the Americans played like rubbish.  It was 0-0 until DaMarcus Beasley represented MLS and the Chicago Fire well with a goal in first half stoppage time.  The Beas would add another for the Americans and in second half stoppage time Greg Vanney added one more to make things a little more respectable.  During the game, I got my stuff packed and checked over for the last time.  I needed a few more things.  I went to Wal-Mart to get what I needed and was shocked by the total price: $6.66.  Not a good sign.  Especialy because I will be on a plane in a few hours.  I got that thought out of my head and it was off to Bloom High School to get picked up by a bus and go to the airport.  Then I thought and I told my sis, what if this was like  Final Destination?   She laughed at me, for it was a joke, and I said my last good-byes to my aunt and her family and my sis and her boyfriend and it was off to the bus.  It started to hit home on the bus.  Two weeks in a foreign country that doesn't speak my language.  At least I have a bunch of friends with me.  My good buddies Anthony, Robert, Eric, the new kid Tim, Suzie from soccer, another good friend Marissa, and the Pascarella twins who are always cool to be with.  After the bus ride, we were at O'Hare Airport.  This is where things got interesting.  We waited in line to drop our luggage off at a... luggage dropoff place and we were on our own until we had to meet to board the plane.  That meant we had about 3 hours to ourselves.  Instead of going to McDonalds as I suggested, we went straight for the boarding gate.  I got in after fumbling through the security check-in like it was my first time (it was my second) and had three hours of nothing to do.  We sat down and I started a game of Airport Soccer with the elder Pascarella twin, Stephanie.  After a few minutes of that mindless fun, the five stooges (me, Eric, Anthony, Robert, and Tim) went off to explore the airport.  That got boring quick and we went back.  Anthony and I left everyone else and walked to the other end of the airport.  There was a huge congregation of boistrous college aged frat boys.  Their plane was delayed so they were given a pass to bypass security and go get some food.  Anthony and I heard this and decided to try our luck and blend in with them in hope of getting McDonald's like my original plan.  The college congregation was so immense we never would have gotten food and gotten back to the gate in time.  We only had about 45 minutes left.  We decided to go back to the gate and starve.  After a while of conversation, it was time to board the plane.  Off we go...  Our seats were scattered so I had no idea who I would sit next to.  I could be sitting with the guys or I could be between two fat dudes.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I would spend the next 8 hours sitting next to the Iacopelli's.  There were little TV screens on the back of the seats so we could watch movies during the flight.  I watched BBC World news and after that they played highlights of the European Championships.  Greece shocked Portugal with a 2-1 win and Spain won 1-0 over a flat Russian side.  Then it was movie time.  There wasn't much interesting on so I decided to watch  The Girl Next Door  with Kim Bauer from "24".  I didn't want to seem like a perv though.  Oh well, it wasn't terrible.  It was like a normal movie aimed at teens.  After a while I tried to sleep.  I didn't sleep much, but I did sleep some.  I woke up and my feet were numb, my eyes hurt, and the back of my head was burning up.  Later was breakfast time.  We had orange juice with muffins and yogurt.  We were over Birmingham so there wasn't alot of time before we got to London.  Minutes before we landed the plane was low to the ground so we could see the city from the window.  There was green pastures everywhere with town homes with red roofs.  When we were close to landing, Marissa and I took a picture and before we knew it, we were in London.   Day 2 tomorrow.
