      Band was a complete disaster. Chris Schilling calls and quites. WTF?! I am not trying to be atheist b/c I am not. I go to church. He said he quite b/c God was telling him band was getting in the way. First off, we don't practice that much and it's for only 2 1/2 more months. NOT BIG DEAL! Anyways, Pat (our drill writer) forgot to write me in the drill. So now I am marching in Chris's spot. Big Problem! One saxaphone marching w/ a bunch of brass members. lol Oh well I guess.     So guess who I like? Well you all heard me talking about Josh. I met Josh @ the Abbey when I went w/ Jeremy like a week ago. Jeremy calls me last night and tells me he is going to a party @ David's. After getting in this big argument w/ my parents (what's new) I convinced my mom to let me go stay the night w/ Jeremy. No harm in letting her not know the whole truth. lol I borrowed the car b/c I didn't want Jeremy to have to take me home @ 9 in the morning. The bad thing was that I had to home by 6:45 in the morning to give the car back to my mom. Besides that...I call Jeremy and ask him if Josh can come. Josh and I have been talking and I tought it would be fun if he came. So he did. I picked him up and MY GOD! did we flirt. All the way in the car. We got there early so we drove around a lil bit. After that we parked where we were suppose to meet Jeremy. I opened up the sun roof and we both sat up in the car and watch pretty much nothing. It was so cute. Then b4 I knew it I turn my head to look @ something and when I turn back I get the most romantic/unexpected kiss. WOW! That boi can kiss. Jeremy gets there and we go to the party. We had a great time and we layed down for a while and just talked. It was a great conversation. We discussed plans for next week. I honestly can't wait for us to get together again. I like this boi so much.

      I am starting something new in my life.&nbsp; I know I am only 17 but I didn't believe I would actually find something that had the potential to be special.     This all started on Sat. night when I went to the Abbey w/ Jeremy and Jessica. They called me out of the blue and asked if I wanted to go. Thank God! I said yes! We had been there for a while and not very people were there. It was kind of boring. (BTW I talked about this in a previous entry. If you want more details check it out.) Untill this cute boi walks in. lol Blah! Blah! Blah! The night goes on and #'s exchanged. I got Josh's. I am very glad I did. We talked a few days ago and he told me he would call back and we would set something up about us getting together. I was like "aight." I really didn't think he was going to call. I am not used to people hitting on me. lol Well, he called tonight b4 I went out and I told him I would call back when I got home. He old me he had tried to call me for the past couple days. I was like "hmmm." So I call when I get home. Let me tell you, that was an awesome conversation I had w/ him. I can't explain this boi. I'll just say, I don't hate him. lol I am very anxious to see where this goes w/ him and I. We are planning a date for sometime next week. He is such a kewl guy to talk to. And w/ him hitting on me makes it so much better. Trust me though, I would have hit on him too. Josh: I can't wait for next week.  Jeremy! Jeremy! Jeremy! What can I say?&nbsp;He is such a great guy. I enjoyed the talk&nbsp;I had&nbsp;w/ him tonight. We'll&nbsp;have to do it again sometime. It was so kewl to get to talk to&nbsp;him about certain things. I think we had a moment. "Tear" lol Nah. Jeremy and I are great friends. And I am so thankful to have that relationship w/ him. I wouldn't change it for anything. Thanx Babe!    Band is good. That's all I need to say. HAHA Band Camp next week. All next week! 8am - 4:30pm Drive by the parking lot to the High School (HONK and SCREAM my name). I would greatly appreciate it. lol

      Friends are a good thing to have. Speaking of friends, Ross and Justin came up to see Rachel, Laura, and I today. I had such a great day w/ them. Eating and playing on the&nbsp;play ground, driveing, FARTING! OMG! Long story. Don't ask. So about the friend thing, they are just a good thing to have. Like Jeremy.&nbsp;Always there to give good advice about bois. And&nbsp;how&nbsp;I'm not aloud to touch Drew.&nbsp; &nbsp; I was shy once again today. Remember Josh, I met him last night? Well..I was nervous to ask him for his # or give him mine, so Jessica did it for me. I brought Jessica a snow cone for her break and picked up the number. I call and he said he needed to call right back. So he calls back. Damn this boi had such a hot voice! We talked for a bit and thats about all. I wanted to ask him out sometime next week but never did it. Shit on my part. But he says that he would call me sometime and we would set something up. Damn he's good looking.&nbsp;   &nbsp; BTW: Mistic River&nbsp;and Along Came Polly are 2 tight ass movies. I recomend them both.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      When you think your down someone comes by and lifts you off of your feet. It all started this evening when I wanted to go do something. I called greyson countless times and got no answer. Oh well. No biggy. So I called around to a few people and got nothing. I called Jonathan knowing he was out w/ his rents but you never know. He was still w/ them but could possibly do something later. Then out of the blue Jessica calls. YAY! Her and Jeremy wanted to hang out. There is not much to do in Mooresville or Monrovia so we head downtown. I asked Jeremy to drop me off @ home so I can drive. I had to be home by 12:30 and I didn't want to rely on them to have to take me home. So we get downtown and head over to the Abby. I love that place. I saw so many friends there tonight and met a new one for the first time. His name is Josh. He's pretty kewl. He came w/ this guy Bryan who knew Jeremy. We talked for a while and I was trying to flirt w/ him. He knew it too. The awesome thing was he was doing it back. Example: Jessica got up and wanted to move chairs. Josh was like take Andrew's seat. We'll share one. I was like YAY! lol When she said no, he skooted his chair closer to mine and put his leg up against mine. HOT! HOT! HOT! It was about time for me to go so Jessica got up and was going to walk me to my car. Josh and Bryan got up too. I guess they were leaving also. So we all walked out and headed to the cars. Jessica looks @ me and says. He thinks your cute! I was like, huh? I am not used to being the one hit on. It was really nice though. I kinda liked it. lol Jessica runs to Josh, gets his # and he tells her to give it to me. SCORE! That sounds bad but I mean it in a good way. Promise! I am really excited to give him a call here in a few days. Mabye tomorrow? Who knows.

        Bois are Tois! Just had to get that one out. Today was a great day. Band went really good and we are getting so much done. We are so freakin small this year but amazeingly good. I am really excited and cant wait to get the season started. It's going to be so much fun. I think...Craig is kind of getting on my nerves. He makes me feel like he is making me feel like shit. If that makes sence. lol Like he goes to the guard and percussion practices. I dont know why dont ask me. There is really no reason for him too. He tells me "Why dont you go?" Sry Craig...I have a life outside of band. Like home, school, and a job.          Why do I like so many people. There are so many guys (even gurls) that I like. I mean not like I want to be serious w/ them. But, maybe a date or 2 w/ them. That would be so much fun. I need to date too. I need to get out and meet new people. This one guy Dan. AH! Awesome guy.     Funny    Good Looking/Hot  Great Personality   Definately someone I would like to get more involved w/. He lives in Canada though. lol I know! I know! I want to try and go see him sometime soon. Hell! We have our life spaned out too. We talk about and all. We faught about where we would live. I want to stay in the states. He wants to stay in Canada. lol It is so much fun to talk to him.     I cant wait to start back @ Steak n' Shake. It's going to be so much fun. I love working there. I dont know why I quite in the first place.     I told Justin I would put this pic on my journal. Dont worry guys, he's str8. Were just good friends. It is a hot pic though.  &nbsp;

      Hey Guys! It's time for change and I'm comeing back to blogger. LiveJournal sucks. There are so many more options on blogger.   Besides that, I have been in such a good mood this past week. Band has been awesome. We have gotten so much done. Our freshman are outstanding. We are in for a good season. We are a really small band this year but I dont think that is going to be a problem.  Greyson and I have been hanging out a lot more and I really enjoy the company. He's such a kewl guy and he's the only guy right now who I would let date my sister. lol W/ me being gay and all I hope my parents dont think that we are together. Greyson's mom does know about me and how he likes my sister so that's taken care of.   I am stuck in this situation. I like somebody. ALOT! I told myself though that I needed to remain single. For my benifit and for others. I am not quite sure if thats what I want. I dont do well in some relationships. I dont know why. I think I rush into things and then I scare myself. I am also afraid to tell this person how I really feel too. So, if you read this and you think I may be talking about you, hit me up and let me know how you feel too.

      I wonder why I waste my time w/ some bois. Remember Josh, yeah we were together for like 2 weeks. The bastered cheated on me after 2 weeks. I was like, oh well. At least I didn't get too attached. I mean this boi bought me a pair of Gucci sun glasses. These bitches are hot! I am still going to talk to him b/c he's a great guy. Just not a great guy to date. I really liked him too. But like I said, oh well. Not my lose. It's more like his. He doesn't know what he's missing. BTW: Thanx Jeremy and Danny for catching him. lol     Jayme your the best. You make me so happy. lol The way you randomly let me know that your horny. I am glad to be your fuck buddy. I would be honored. "He is suppose to come over tonight" I hope he does. He's so kewl.     My dad knows now about me and things are going great. He wishes I wasn't but he accepts. He was like "Son, you dont know what your missing out on. Girls are hot!" I was like yeah dad, girls are hot. But they are bitches. "Yeah they are bitches son but they are hot!" OMG!!!
