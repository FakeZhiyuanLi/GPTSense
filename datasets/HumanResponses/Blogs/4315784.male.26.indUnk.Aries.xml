      So I begin...  This is going to be my diary. Since my housemate is kind of nosy, has a key to room and frankly has way too much time on her hands, I think that this way safer than writing in a book kept under my mattress. Why write a diary? I'm hoping that it will help me know myself a little better, and force me to make a few changes to my life.  There used to be this kid at our school, polite people would refer to him as being 'slow' while the less polite people would mercilessly rip the piss out of him and regularly administer beatings (before you think that I'm being artistic or metaphorical, I'm not talking about me here), anyway, everyday he would write a new entry to this little pocket size journal that he carried around in his anorak pocket. Sometimes he would hang out with my group of friends. I think it was because we made fun of him less than everyone else, though thinking back we were still terribly mean to him. Every week he'd read out his diary entries to us, they were always nearly identical, and though he recorded everything that he did in the day there was never actually anything of interest to anyone written in there.  "Got up, had breakfast, got dressed and tied my own shoes, caught bus to school, played football, caught bus home, had tea, watched telly, had bath, went to bed."  My friends and I used to laugh at this, but I can remember how sad it made me feel too. I had the same feeling last week. My boss decided that I should attend a course designed to give me more assertiveness in the workplace, obviously since I wasn't assertive enough to say no I went along. I've heard that courses like these were a bit of fun where you got to role play and play fun games (like building Tower bridge out of jaffa cakes). The other people in the group were all nice enough, kind of quiet as you'd expect. I remember feeling absurdly proud that I was one of the louder people there. As part of the 'getting to know you exercises' we had to ask our partner a serious of banal questions, the last one of which was 'what is interesting about you?'. 'I do a lot of knitting' was the response given by the lady I was paired with was. That made me so sad that I could have wept, I've nothing against people who knit - but for a nice, quite attractive, 35 year old woman to think that the most interesting fact about herself is that she likes knitting?! I mean that is a bit upsetting.  Since then I've been wallowing in one of those horrible periods of self reflection, asking is my life any more interesting? Get up, go for run, shower, go to work, go home, watch telly with housemate, go out, go home, go to bed. It's not actually that much more interesting. Sure I go out with my friends a lot and usually enjoy whatever we end up doing but it certainly wouldn't make a thrilling movie or even a bad play.  Maybe keeping a journal will force me to make my life more interesting, just so I have something to write about. This maybe the totally wrong reason for going about life change, but as long as it works I don't really care.
