      So I am insane...  Yesterday as i tried to lie down for a bit to relax after the tooth extraction, no sleep would come because it's bad to sleep after too much motrin- ( Apnea , or "old-hag" related complications)- i almost rested for about an hour. As I did so, i was having a dream about trains, of course, since i am planning to take one.  Does  the Matrix  affect you like this? i was in an underground tunnel, two tubes- except, they were rectangluar and at crossed  x angles- floors down and i felt ok but, i suddenly heard a signal coming.  It was electric, and, i worried i was no longer in good enough shape to be able to jump up the two concrete levels to get out in time, as i also had no idea exactly how much time i had to get there.  I jumped out of bed, heard Rain begin to fall on my side of the house.. ran outside to smoke and enjoy it... i grabbed my umbrella (the lavendar one) , statred shaking it at the Skye. just then Lightning and Thunder begin to erupt all around.. i was daring it to strike me, or, i was distracting it from striking everything else. I was being a plasmoid (dog plasma, people plasma!) so that every other plasmoidical objeckt could fail to be struck, as such.  But then of course i got really afrayed and was like, uh,k sorry about that, Gods. Sorry about all that daring you to strike  me /us/ business! I had my baloon from yesterday tied to the umbrella casa and, my rubber (are they rubber?) sandals. on, i assured my mother when she began to question my heretickal activites.  Flash floods. My parents, quite rightly, think i am insane. Espcially when i tried to explain to my mom about how i woke up to the dreame from the dreame- within- the dreame to notice all this, but it must just be because i have a hole in my mouth today.  Anyway, it was great fun and, later when i watched the median distractor Palm tree get struck- just as i was comtemplating the term "Monsoon wedding", and why they call it that- poof! At least it got struck and none of ours. The neighbors across the street were worried about it and pulled their SUV's back into the garage to see what happened. they have a very large garage and many vehicles, i suppose. I am not going to go into any more details than this, suffice to say that it was a good show. I got a couiple pix of the tree in quesiton and, a piece of it's fallen frond.  Then there were the Olympian opening ceremonies, which my father thinks are overdone but i was verry interested to see how they would be done.  I fell asleep, thankfully for a couple hours after this but, Mother Nature, father sky- is that the way it is?- would not be quiet enough, and i had to go out to enjoy more of it again... Smells like wet dog crap out there now! Fish bowl enzymes, chocolate cake on a humid day. Rotting fungus, Death be not proud ...  And at least the Crows have arrived or, some of their scouts are about.  I had forgotten all about it being Fryday the 13th, too! It seems lucky to me, but i am weird.

      I was crying for 12 hours or so, since 2 am yesterday when i awoke and could not go back to sleep and the pain from my lower jaw had intensified and spread all over my head, into my soul, so bad i didn't know what else to do. Head ache, heart ache, ache of existenze...i finally had  T ooth #21 extracted! Woo hoo, that was so much easier and cheaper than i had imagined.  So, Yes! i called on  T , whose name should not be said. Usually I avoid doing this as He can bring misery but, we so desperately needed any strike from above here, anything to bring Rain! (my tears had already been falling)  sidenote: ( T  is a local trixster spirit/ anti-hero by the name of   Taquitz ;  i won't go into the details, you can look it up yourself or i could tell you the story in person, but it takes a while and the conditions have to be right, with light shows and motivational story telling circumstances. Suffice to say that, he is known to take the form of meteor showers, lightning or Thunder, and precipitates disasterous (to some) consequences. His name should not be said three times at one sitting,  like Beetlejuice, or Candyman, if you like  modern urban legend typelore. His tales usually involve some dispute over the love of a local female who he covets away from the lover she can't be with, etc.)  I heard later- while sitting in the dentist chair, musing on the weather news so as to distract from thee fear, that there has indeed, finally, been a small Thunder- shower near here , though not exactly in our area. At least that was something! (Hail Thunder, 9 of Air, transformative thinking...-  ha ah aha, Hail! Thunder ! etc.) :)  Then afterwards, we stopped by my aunt's house to feed her cat and found a desert tortoise. I mean, a large one, like 1-1/2 feet diameter. I had neverseen one before around here, and we are considering whether (whither?) to call the Living Desert, as we think they are a protected species. I wonder what attracted him there? I think it is the cactus, perhaps (that is one special cactus, 25 feet tall, prickly pear or whatever it is called; they make Tequilla out of it i hear but no one i know knows how to do that. It is a shame to let it just die)... or, the strange weather...  Which leads me back to the subjekt of thee beached dolophins off the coast of Florida, and my argument with my mom about it.  "Mom, they can hear these things coming. They use sonar like we use sight. What is it that you like about them anyway?"  Perhaps she is right. She has been to Florida just about every year and i have not been there since i was like 17, so, i guess she knows more about the dolphin self- beachings  than me.  It was finally cloudy all afternoon, at least and, we had a bit of a respit from that evil, never- arriving, oppressivly- heavy, always promised but lying, Monsoon.  Many people don't know that flash floods are a hazard in the dez'

       hahahaha      Yes, we had been discussinng the differences between DuChamp, Dali, and Dadaism...   i always get all those Da-s cornfused. :)      And i have been cracking up because i read the blogger suggestions for how not to get fired or have family or friends want to kill you over your blog. I have, er, had this expereince also.. uh...       And of course while i was trying to deal with all that i got out of the frame and forgot what i was doing!      Anyone know whatever happened to PAX, whatever, that guy who was blogging from Iraq at the beggining of the war last year?      Anyone  else remember Mahir, and how that was all one big joke? It must be a generational thing I guess.. I am an oldie, and thus i must be not - a goody-.       I am like Socrates i guess: i know  Nothing!          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~          i the meantime, until I can think of what to do next, please visit the following links, of some bands i *may* know of. i will have a more compleat list, later. if the links are still there! we are having soem issues here of late...           urlLink www.pleasuresick.com            urlLink www.cindytalk.org           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~          love- daar X

      It's a strange story how i began to blogg in this way... I won't go into all the sordid details but, I was yesterday looking up the sone lyrics for an old Cheap trick song, "I want you to want me,", but, instead, misspelled it and, put in "Cheap Trix" . Surprise!! Of course i would think of that store, "I love my piercer", and my old acquaintences who work there, and old amis who still work, play, do business there.  So I came upon the blogg of Michaelville, and, voila! I'ts like magic. I think i was in some Canadian oriented search engine, because stories about "Ou est la Tosca" showed up, too, and some Canadian jazz festival musician- who sounded really cool but i know nothing about that, having been stuck in the south-by-south west for 1/2 of my life now, i just realized earlier this evening. EEk!!  Hey, Michael! I  am also stuck here in AOHell right now, behind my parents' desert firewall, but maybe eventually, i will make it back to my home stomping grounds. Beautiful half-conch shape,  sort of a Paris, but without so much the a-round-is-ments (ha) and with more of a cut off swirly shape, as seen from the view above. Louis (14eme? or 16 eme?- the scholars disagree)  nose bridge, i have recently taken to calling her. Blinking blue lights at night on the airport tree-wind light; fireflies, all aflight...  If i can catch a train, plane, or something out of here soon, I will be visiting perhaps as early as next week, on the new moone. Until then I shall endeavou to utilize this space in only the most construcktive way of public- confessionalizing /ventage- behaviour. Meanwhile I will concentrate on the dreaming, it seems to be what i do beast.  See you soon!  Love & Blessings Rhonda Michelle x  R, svp- I have some great books to recommend you, if you have not already read them!
