      Oi,oi... Boa tarde!!!  Pra vcs, a letra da música do Audioslave...   Enjoy it...  Like a stone - Audioslave  On a cobweb  afternoon  in a room full of emptiness  by a freeway  I confess I was lost in the pages  of a book  full of death  reading how we'll die alone  and if we’re good we’ll lay to rest Anywhere we want to go  In your house  I long to be  room by room  patiently  I’ll wait for you there  like a stone  I’ll wait for you there  alone   and on my deathbed  I will pray  to the gods and the angels  like a pagan  to anyone who will take me to heaven  to a place  I recall  I was there so long ago  the sky was bruised  the wine was bled and there you led me on   (Chorus)    And on I read Until the day was gone  and I sat in regret  of all the things I’ve done  for all that I’ve blessed  and all that I’ve wronged  in dreams until my death  I will wander on.  Blessed be...

      Good afternoon  Yesterday and today I had the Vestibular (UFAM), I didn't get much so I think I will not pass...   Well, yesterday after the test I went home, had lunch with everybody and then Lilica came here to pick me up and teach her... Tinho was at home but he went out with his friends to play dominoes. :P Then me and Lissianne stayed home to watch some movies. We watched  The planet of Apes  and  Signs  too. Then my baby came back home and we watched the rest of the film, just the two of us cause Lilica had gone to her frinds house to pick her wallet which she had forgotten there in Gege's house.   This morning I had the other test from Ufam which was BOMBASTIC!!! I didn't know anything about Physics nor even Chemistry, but for Geography and Biology I think I could make it...  Lissianne has started a blogg for herself:   urlLink Lilica's blog  Click there and visit my sister-in-law's blogg!!! ;)  Well, Ailtinho came to school to visit me this afternoon. I didn't know that I could fall in love again like this... And I love him... He's the sweetest thing ever. I hope we can stay together at least forever...

      Oi,oi...  Well, I'm still with this fucking flu. I've worked a lot and today I didn't even have a free time.  I think that Mandy must be upset with me, cause I didn't go to her prom. I had forgotten about it...  My honey didn't pick me up yesterday. I miss him...

      Oi,oi...  Well, yesterday was my birthday. I got some phone calls from my relatives and a few friends. Mommy, My mother-in-law, Michella, Samir, Mandy, Aunt Suelly, Alessandra and Adriana and then Lissianne. Ah, and of course my husband too. I haven't got any presents yet. Today is my Mom's birthday and I think I was the first one to wish her happy-birthday. And tomorrow will be a special dinner at my Mom's house.   I just can't wait to watch Harry Potter's new film : The prisoner of Azkaban in the book is amazing and I hope that the version on the film is nice too. I will watch it with my husband and with Neca.  Ah, by the way, yesterday Neca got disappeared for some hours, she had lost her bus card an then she couldn't come back home by bus. The problem was that she hadn't called and everybody at home got crazy. We thought that she had been stolen, or murdered, or something worse as she is an air-headed... But thank goodness, one of her friends from ICBEU took her home along with his parents. Ufffffs...  Blessed be...

      Oi,oi...  Good night everybody.  Well, It's been a while I haven't written here, but I'm back. I have just worked and sometimes I have been to the doctor too. My little daughter is already 6 months old of pregnancy and I''m looking forward to seeing the ultrasound exam again just to see how she is...   I'm so happy.   Blessed be...
