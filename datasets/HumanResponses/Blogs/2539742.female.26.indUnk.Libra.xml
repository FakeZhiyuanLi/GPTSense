      counting the hours..still putting my annual review on hold - entah - waiting for just the right moment maybe? definitely not in this state - just woke up, had a piece of bread topped with cheese and wrapped in a towel. nope, not now.   fh finally resurfaced this morning. havent replied any of his sms-es just yet. let him wait. he has JP with him to have fun with. who needs me? except ladee of course. i lied to ladee last nite. more like faked myself. anyone who reads should be able to catch the drift.. *sigh* sorry ladee..  now i wish i am at work. suddenly it sucks to be in the house alone - there's a c.s.i countdown thing going on since noon. ala..watched already..so can do other stuff..normally on wed night myeyes would be glued to the telly and all i take in was speedle la, caine la..duquesne la...LL said it's SO immature for someone my age to be watching telly so much, instead of going out with frens and ..err..hang out..??? to LL, if i am in ur religion, i would have been filling my belly with god-knows-what by now and slept with god-knows-how-many men by now..not that i regret with my faith but i guess (maybe some, not all) sometimes the curiosity rises so high.. broken some rules here and there...heck even a smoker by now.. JA, also a mentho-menthi here.. *smile* ...  ladee ajak me go 'for a walk' afterwork..hmm..macam nak but...malas pun ada..country spirit nak habis dah nie...   one thing i would (probably) regret the most for 2003 is fh..the one thing (more like the one male) that has changed my life so much within these blardy few months and has managed to give me an emotion change so rapid that any decision is just too damn hard to make. to leave or not to leave..to love or not to love...  *sigh*

      my glasses turned out to be great. lighter, hence not that comfy initially. glad to be back to b.l.a.c.k again after so long.  country spirit is on - sun fong and ah soon is framed for adultery. hah! adultery! something i would think very dangerous and (secretly) fun to do..wink wink..  nothing much today. no interesting movie was on - had to resort to Oprah..sigh.. nvmla..the guy next block had the radio on blaring like mad since morning. fell asleep to linkin park and woke up to seven nation army.. s.w.e.e.t   fh didnt send me his normal morning sms. sent one at noon but he had kept his silence till now. ladee called few times. see? yg depan mata jugak yg baik..yang dikejar..hmm..eksen habiss...  the year-end blues is nearing...nak buat hari ni ke esok... ?   JP is coming back today to fh. Me?

Kill bill was okay. despite the disturbing ways i had to put up with to buy it, it didnt give me the much expected thrills..and Uma Thurman was..not as beautiful as she was in Gattaca. Any contradicting opinion? letme know ppl...lets hear it!!!  and the guy gave me Nemo 2 instead of the 1st one. dang.. my nephew gonna screw me for that..sorrry baby..aint aunt's fault...  and today..hmm..whats it gonna be... going to pick up my chintzy-cheated-by-desperate-salesgirls glasses at 11.. and then.. ladee coming home noon - gotta help ladee finish the presentation..wish can go to movie..but nothing interested now..ROTK? sick of it already... Lang Buana..??? hahaha...i'd rather eat bugs than go watch that movie..haunted mansion..? still have the jitters from darkwater.no way jose..  hell..go mandila... till later...

      the fool of me..just realised the dates are all wrong..!!! cheh... i am damn careless nowadays...i mean, no more of those careful ways when doing stuff..always overlook small details that are unortunatelyvery obvious to others..  mg, a colleague is one good example of a person who doesnt have anything better to do than pick on me, my stuff, my words, even my clothes.. hmm... ladee said that is be coz her own life sucks!!! ..hahaha... maybe its true afterall...but fudge lives a more interesting life..  after the last post last nite, clicked into ym's kl chat room. met nicezguy777 and ghazi..even gave my number to the former..i am such a loser when it comes to sweet-intelligent talking guys.. like i did with fh last year.. dang... i cant login to ym since i logged in to the net like..half hour ago..??!!   today..hmm..meeting fm at noon ..another cruise i suppose... told ladee 'booking a 7pm show at sunway' ...non-committal ladee sounded..i can understand..hasnt done a thing abt ladee's assignment...and final semester too..!!!  oh well...nothing interesting to look forward to... the thots last nite still lingers...

      had late dinner..unless e'body eat dinner at 10 then mine was early la. re-heat some prata i still have from puasa time and left over of black pepper chicken from lunch me and ladee had our dinner while watching just shoot me..  we talked a bit. hmm.seems i have some 'issues' with meself...confessed to ladee abt me not being truthful to my own self and how i always fee dissociated from my oneself..and how i get to feel exactly as the persona i use on fn & fh and is...is it just me or everybody has this but they just dont layan the innerthingy like i do..? i dont know i can even LIE to my ownself..i blame the whole thing to the damn book i am reading..makes me wanna dig more into all this psychoanalysis shhit..  anyone who reads this, pls just spare me a few seconds (or rather minutes) and tell me whether am i for real in this problem or am i just deliberately depressing myself..ladee said i have all the tendencies to either explode, do something stupid and fatal or simply go mad..god..i am that screwed..  fh is not helping either..supposed to meet fh tomorrow but..a thot came to mind abt someday if ladee finds out abt fh. ladee would definitely leave methen..and what would become of me ? ladee was all i have for the past years..the support and endless love..and fh? i thot it was a mere diversion..a toy i wanted to play ..just like fn and is..but fell hard for fh.and along the way..i destroyed my ownself principle..i let go of the one thing  i shouldnt..even compromised my faith...and yet..?  i cant take it ; what am i waiting for ; i cant fake it ; i miss u even more ; the way i did before... i hate you but i love you ; i cant stop thinking of u.. i am s.t.u.c.k  on you..   fh..i need all the strength in the world to let go of you...

      its christmas 2003 .. nothing big.  a one-day off from work..sigh..tomorrow still have to go to work... double sigh... as planned, met fh yesterday and we spent the afternoon together. it was great, until the very last one..he failed and i failed too...sob! damn! thank god for the meet-up with ladee after. that was good .. as usual ladee was being ladee-self and i came back to my ole goodself..which was a very big relief..  am reading a novel, equal to the crazy psycho-book silence of the lambs. it triggered my old intention of seeing a shrink. i know i have problems. loads of them. sf, an old friend whom i have made the note to be in touch with every now and then is a great example of a future problem i would face. Is is one too.   christmas will be spent on books, house chores and some blogging activity... i hope i have the quietness till evening..ample time to rediscover myself ..for now..  merry christmas 2003..!

      2003-06-03 01:32:27 (GMT) It Was My Day Off Dark, sick & twisted It was my day off Months before The pain started..and haunt me ever since It was my day off After numerous visits Both good and bad doctors All predicted the same It was my day off Work is finishing Results as what was the norm It was my day off I made the step That ruins my quite Secret, unknown Loving, peaceful Life….. It was my day off I made a go Risking all Wanting all But I survived..still.. It was my day off Built on lies and deceits I know all is wrong And I persist… It was my day off I posed the question  The answer was in agreement I am Sick Dark Twisted Bitch

      ..made up my mind that i am gonna work and at the end of the day came back to office and write something in my blog. but today, i just spent 10 minutes looking other ways coz i dont know what to write. i feel weird. had lunch at dave's deli, the weld and ended up telling N abt my inner problems..N is different from M despite them being friends. M is more patronizing, love to tell me how wrong i am and how i should do things her way... N on the other hand is much cooler and listens...yeah..that the word...N loves to listen too and even love it more to probe...i hate that in M!!!!  visited kooky's today..nice... it has become a routine nowadays to check the blogs...eve's, jules', gm's, loser's and now kooky's...  listening to gothica: clifff of suicide..dunno WHY i like this song so blardy much...feel like in a tomb everytime its on..  ::When everything is bathed in colour::And a blinding golden path::Shines from the sky onto the sea::To the white shingle beach which is below you::Blood stains stand out every so often: red poppies.  ladee picking me up. no lrt today!!! yay!!!!!

      i am worried. never have i felt so worried as this. and it is not even myself. its ladee. she been getting her headache more and more often nowadays and have started talking abt suicide - not wanting to go ahead with her work and study - she even cried over the phone to me today after telling me she didnt wanna go to class. i thot penang trip, which was all abt making her happy to come back and finish her final semester would do the work. but apparently things are turning for the worst.   my rapid change of mood continue today. have a feeling my colleague is finding me wierder by the day. i dunno.   ladee: i cant think, i cant work, i hate my studies. can i just end it?  jL : i gotta fix my brain ladee. how leh... ladee: .........  both of us are on our ways to ruination. full stop.

      ladee was sick when i got back last nite - too bad she chose to be sick on the day when i was so rajin to spent my coupla hours searching for my thumbdrive and my balik kg tix and managed to slot in half and hour of waiting for a bloke who didnt know how to use the cash deposit machine and ended up slotting and re-slotting his chintzy rm150 without considering a lady behind him who was tapping her kasut like hell ...and ended up asking the guy to 'stop trying and get the fuck out of the way' ..heheeh...i was sure the ppl waiting in line to withdraw money at the machine next to it didnt think such would come out from a sopan ladee like me..eheh...   bad enough, i didnt get the tix to go back this raja haj. great!!! gonna break the news to ma on saturday. she gonna freak!!! and dad, hmm...i dunno..even if he curse me into a stone or a lonely lobster in pulau perhentian also i dont mind anymore..after his langkawi rejection..  every tuesday nite, i would loyally watch alias and every fucking time, i would be wishing that i have that curvaceous body of hers and hair so straight i dont need to save money for rebonding.. *sigh*..just imagine if i do: my pa&ma would not be telling me every single fucking time i go back home to 'eat less, sleep less. how to snag a guy like dis??", my colleagues wont use me as one of their joke-dish, my team members would not feel so high and mighty like they have been till this very day and fh would have loved me more (..NOT!!!!) ..   but i am still thankful for whatever left in me: tall like Iman (not thin-stick like her tho..), fair-skinned.. (JH is not, despite having a to-die-for bod)..oh oh and thats just abt it ??? nahh..theres more..according to ladee that it..something internal she said..hmm... *wink wink*

      am still on site and to tell the truth, despite enjoying the whole idea of having only my peers as my team members, there is still some elements which separated me from the rest of em..i.e two of the other gals are good frens hence they are always exchanging stories i really know nothing abt and dont feel like asking( they do that to me btw..) and yet feel left out. ..entah....    still waiting for the doctor to give me the name of a shrink to go to. he agreed to refer me to one after i broke down and cry in front of him..ladee thinks its getting worse too.. :(  i know it is too since i cancelled my lunch with my colleagues M&N this afternoon after they spent the entire journey down the lift talking abt wedding presents-surprise-'i couldnt believe-it'-'yeah, damn'-'its good tho' conversation... of course they didnt know that was the real reason, but i ended up eating 'tapau McD' from the weld and doing some more of work until they returned..i felt weird abt the whole thing, hell i am sure they are too..but i couldnt help it and i didnt wanna have a silent lunch with em and ruin  their  fun instead!  getting the usual post-audit-day-tired feeling and thinking of going back in one hour tops..  its a happy feeling that i get since eve's wedding and her entries on it..and been thinking abt a possible 'mine' but yesterday when i arrived home and plonked in front of the telly something occured to me: if i marry and my husband demands my attention right this very fucking moment, would i give up my soap opera and have sex instead? hmm... the bigger area in my heart and pussy *grins* says yes but another portion says no. entah... but i sure as hell wanna do it legally, anytime, anywhere..not that it is the only thing that matters in a marriage but it contributes too..! and to hell if i wanna make it as one... :)  ::I'm through with it::Over it::Not having it::Crazy sh*t::Not feeling this::Can't deal, I quit::No more, No more::I'm through with it::Not having it::This crazy sh*t::Not feeling it::Can't deal with it::No more, I quit::No more, no more::  fh has maintained his dissapearing act until i sms-ed him last nite abt my jaring account which i believe he has been using since he took hold of the pwd..damn! now, i have to resort to only my tmnet at home.. i didnt know its a prepaid kinda thing since maxisnet stopped its service and moved all willing accounts to jaring.   am i gonna go nuts in the end? hopefully no but at the rate i am going..i am not so sure anymore..

      spent the CNY holiday in penang..it was great, altho fudge was around so much me and ladee couldnt even kissed..!!!!   wednesday late evening, finally confirmed where we were gonna stay, how long and what would it cost me to get ladee there..later went to get tix and rushed home to pack and sleep early.. we were both tired from work and grumpy and i thot at the time..'gone la penang' ..  but the next day, it was bright shiny day and we both got into the mood for a holiday. it has been a while and penang sounded enticing thursday morning.   all in all, i ate nasi kandar to the point of throwing up and managed to catch the last samurai as well. we stayed at vistana and KBJ was right behind it so it took less than 10 mins to get there by walk. had long talks with fudge and fh was nowhere in my mind. obviously i wasnt in his as well since i heard nothing from him through out the four-day stay.  my parents decided to turn down my offer of taking them to langkawi during raya haji. damn! instead, the requested me to take them in May..in a way i was dissapointed and to hell i am gonna plan for anything in MAy for them.. no way!!! this is already the 2nd time they turned down my offer and i aint gonna let meself be angry abt such again in the future..talk about using my benefit for them..!!!!  ladee managed to squeeze sometime to do her work and me too..thank god..that was supposed to be the main thing ..and yet, fudge in the picture there is really no time to ourselves anymore..  all in all, it was fun and great holiday.. despite spending a fortune but at least i had fulfilled ladee's dream and wish to go to penang ..at the same time i spent time with my best friend who was in need for some comfort and loving ..

      sunday was a busy day.. now what did i do yesterday...  oh oh..was working...read some stuff i brought back from home while cruising channel 16..Muse's time is running out seems to be sounding better and better...and hysteria too..thanks to s.e.n for introducing me to their music... looking forward to next week: going for the istana budaya's Anak kerbau sumthing. a friend said it was good and for once, ladee agreed to go with me provided i help her with some article review..again..??? argghhh...  and after several weeks of saying no to ladee, yesterday i relented... had to...actually after the last one with fh, i kinda lost interest. physically, that is..mentally i am still h**** as a horse..hahaha....but entah...there is no way of telling ladee..'look, no!!' coz it would hurt her feelings and she was always there to rub and massage my back, play with my hair till i sleep and keep mae warm through the nite.. so ... :)  the whole weekend trip plan gone kaputt..decided on friday nite to plan for a better date somewhere after her semester ends..fudge was dissapointed..she already booked a room in hotel S. the same nite, while waiting for ladee at petrol station, sms-ed fh. reply that i got was  fh:'with her, makan. later..'  and i replied  jL:'..great, just great. have fun then' .. and miraculously he caught the sarcasm in the sms (normally, he wouldnt or pretended to be some idiot) and replied fh:'pls dont add..weather not good here..' hello...!!!! why should i care..i wasnt angry actually but for once i want him to know that i have feelings too... and he sent me few more sms-es over the weekend, none of which i replied. and this morning, while checking out my office mails, received from him -  fh: when u are with her, i understand. but why when i am with my her, it is something BIG ? ( yeap, big cap 'BIG')  and i replied (this time true anger) jl: did i yell at u before for such? something is not right. been trying to tell.  ..and that was the beginning of some exchange of stupid sms-es ding-dong2 abt whose fault that things are not right..bla bla bla...finally he got the msg to him blardy brain and ask me fh: do we have issues..???  OMG OMG OMG ...NOW only he got it????   ladee off to class..need to take a bath and finish some work.. enough said abt my pathetic r/ship with a man who thinks he is so great MY world goes only around him when HIS goes around his blardy smurfy car and his car club crap....

      Since I started working, I treated my female colleagues as more than mere colleagues. Well, maybe not all but some who works closely to me. Hence, the topics we talked about could range from nothing to personal. My weakness is I trust people easily and I open up to people quite a lot. Although not all but three knows that I am a non-hetero, the other dilemmas in my life would often be the topic of our conversation, and they as well sometimes talk about their problems though honestly, I am no good with advice. Most of them are young married people, so apart from our age and our similar taste in movies or music, the coupling life is not something I am qualified to chip in my two cent’s worth. And I rarely do. But the problems with my fellow ‘friends’ is that they take my life into their hands and comments away at all and everything. One of them. M is recently married and despite being the eldest in the family, from her stories sometimes u can tell that she is one hell of a spoiled brat. But, since she is the eldest, she assumes the role of the matured sister to me. I hate it. But the so called friendship continues. Until Friday.  We had our usual conversations and the topic was whether ur colleague is also ur friend. M criticised me, indirectly, that I do not judge well. I couldn’t tell who is a colleague and who is a friend. I was hurt. Still am. I decided there and then that whatever after this, she would only be a colleague then. No more assistance in anything outside work.   Came home from work, and I remembered another friend from work whom I go out to dinner with sometimes,Y. Is she a friend or a colleague? I couldn’t decide. There was one dinner which ended with an argument, Y said she was not obliged to tell me anything coz I am a mere colleague. That hurt too. Badly. I didn’t have the heart to speak to her and no more dinner after that until she came asking if I wanna go out for another dinner with her.   Ladee said I am being childish. M said that to me also before. Something about me being overly sensitive when I shouldn’t. Shouldn’t I? And even if I did, why would that be any business of them? Most of all, M didn’t and still don’t have any right to say anything like that to me.   Sent sms to Ladee that day saying that I finally realised I don’t have any friends in the department.  I was very upset but had to control my emotions and maintained my professionalism becoz I was still on site. And I had to maintained my leader composure. But inside, my heart was crying and flooded with tears by the time I came home.   I don’t know if there is anything I should do or change after that. Or I should just forget about it and move on. And pretend nothing happened.   Reversing the thing around, what is my judgement on these people. Do I treat them as friends? Do I value them more that mere accomplice in work ? Maybe that is what I should concentrate on. Thinking of looking up for Criteria To Be A Friend To Someone. Maybe in  a while. I’ll add the result in upcoming entries.   Be Objective, jL. BE OBJECTIVE!!!!!!

NY and then 1st Sat.. barely any news from him. he sent me mail after i told him i miss him and cd he pls email me... sigh..to that extend...sigh...had a change of heart at noon - told him tak jadikla. have swollen eye - which is kinda true .. i have 'ketumbit' ..( dunno la how to explain what the heck is it.but it selalu jadik on your eyelid so kinda painful for me to do any flirting since batting my eyelid has become a painful act..sob!) and cancelled..his only reaction was ..

      hehehe...i didnt know i am THIS cute...and fofular too..!!!!!    Hello, Pikachu from Pokemon. You are very friendly and nice, but when somebody you don't know comes to talk to you, you are very shy and so scared you won't run away. You do whatever is loserish, and you do not fight back if somebody is mean to you. If you had magical powers, you would use them seriously (evilly). So, basically, you are a wimp, a loser, and everything NOT cool to the people around you - even though you ARE the good guy, but if you had advantage, you would do what is NOT loserish :)    urlLink   *****WHAT CARTOON ARE YOU???*****     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      this pic is very special to me. it exudes what is in me. the dark side of me.   i go by different names to different people. my favorite is junkie_lady. been using it since uni time. initially it was junkie_baby but somehow the name got lost and i changed to junkie_lady. seems to fit me better. when i go online for chats, loads of people would ask: why junkie? taking drugs? how narrow-minded can these people be..? the addiction is there but not for drugs. as i put in my blog; i am a love junkie. i want to love and be loved. i crave love as much as i crave for food..hahah..that explains the bulge .. as i explained to PT when he asked me; i said i am crazy of love. i would want to be able to express it and received the same in return.   and the name stays. till now. tho, by now i cant use it as much any more. so i created hot_gin. wanted only gin : duno why but since i needed to create something most remote from jL i go for hot_gin.   i dont like it as much as jL. i miss being jL. being hot_gin means being a stranger, but sharing the same experiences as jL.   and there's also gothica_lady. i dressed up in black for my company dinner and got the idea to come up with gL. gL is more passive, into herself and devote herself to anything black. no, some may say 'black only doesnt represent gothic'. true. but its a start and black has had always been my color since forever. even wear black lipstick whenever opportunity arises. and some black shades for the eyes..  there are different sides of me..i am worried sometimes: am i not normal? screwed? crazy? to hell and back - yet, still no answer...

      *sigh* not a good morning to start with today. *sigh*  first, i had problem surfing the net, even checking hotmail was a painful process of trying and asking ppl around whether they can or not, to determine whether it is my NB problem or the network. tired of trying, logged a problem log to the IT guy: the answer? a lot of ppl also problem,girl! hmm.. okay lor...thank god for the sweet smile he left me with...*smile*  and then, despite having less than 1/2 of dept's population around today my boss managed to pass me some work to do still.. sob! nvmla..something to do while waiting for work off-premise... :)  *bloink* forgot to add another memorable event for 2003: LP concert..woohooo.......!!!!! it was a blast!!! went with ladee so have to behave a bit la..no jumping around.. sob!   would u believe if a guy who just chatted with u less than 5 times and talked with u over the phone twice, less than 5 minutes each claimed to be t.u.r.n.e.d.o.n by you. would u believe him? hahaha...i thot so.. PT told me he was turned on while talking to me. well, not talk la. we were chatting via ym while i waste my time at home watching mr.cinderella yesterday. it was a bad movie (mistik is worst btw). why oh why the remote control too far away from me yesterday; i could have saved myself the boredom... sob!  me & ladee, we planned to cook yesterday. and cook we did..sumwhere around 5 plus .. had to say no to PT who wanted to call me ALL the way from US hahaha...dont want ladee to know i have been flirting again.. *grin* ..and while i was rinsing (dunno if this is the best term to use) the beras, my sis called: pakcik S is on his way to ur house. oh shit!   better not cerita more. suffice to say, i was a bad hostess with an empty fridge.   i cannot stop thinking abt PT. he was a sweet talker, no doubt abt it. lets just play along and see how it turns out. no harm wut, he is not even in M'sia!!!!..  btw, wanted to put a pic here but dunno where i can park the pic la. anyone can help me with this? seriously, i just go to links i could find and copied them..no wonder my blog is so U.G.L.Y ..sob!   miss fh.

      dekat padamu..itu destinasiku...  self-confident. hmm. need to acquire those. loose those flabs i have been carrying around..? should i work towards it? almost everybody who knows me (& have seen me these past few months) advised me to loose some weight (how to get a guy like dis?/ u're not young anymore/etc/etc) and well.. i do want to. but..sometimes, my flip-side would tell me it doesnt matter. to get a hubby doesnt require u to have a nice bod. look at syanie-lah!!! :P  and come to think of it, i dont want a husband just yet. (although sometimes late at nite, i wish for a big arms with long fingers warming me up to sleep... *sigh* think of the money i need to simpan for the wedding expenses? seen a fren bawak bekal everyday to save money for her kenduri..euughh...taknak-lah!   and another tiny thing: kids. i want to marry a guy who wouldnt mind if i dont bear him any kids. ada ke yg macam tu ? to date. only fh je..itu pun coz he got two from his previous marriage.. *sigh* ... but this one can kautim i think.. i hope.. i pray...(aaaaaaaaa...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)  all in all, i am going to avoid from m.a.r..r.i.a.g.e from being part of my NY's aims/targets. I wish for ladee to graduate and to be able to achieve what she desires most. i wish for fh to also get what he wants and achieve what he deserves. i wish for my sisters to be happy with their families. i wish my brothers would be okay and well. i wish for mom & dad to panjang umur, travels to places they been wanting to go and to be healthy. i wish for my darling niece to snap out of her manja ways and be more responsible.   i wish for myself to stop the madness in my head, get on with life and sleep tight at nite.

NO!!!" ) hahahaha....   watched laila isabella while mopping the floor. miss nya fh..!!!!!! supposed to cook lunch now..but..sob! how leh...to cook means making a phone call to mother and a very long call it will be... :(  see la..  to all, happy new year.. may your resolutions for 2003 menjadik ..( i doubt... no? sue me!) and for 2004 better resolutions or easy, make a copy of 2003's ... 10cent only...hehehe...  mine? as i mentioned to G.M, i wanna resolve my mental issues/problems and THEN move on to other MORE serious stuff in my life..   fh. i love you. ladee. i love you.

      unfortunately..all the beeeeaaauutiful things i imagined would be experienced when i finally got to spend a nite with fh didnt come true..  M.O.T.S : NEVER PUT ANY EXPECTATION !!!  i still didnt learn my lessons..maybe i am too stubborn to nail some warnings or Donts in my head abt him, since it has been only a year since we got together.. he was with jules for FIVE !!!   ..and the whole breaking up shit..managed to dig up some confession from him abt our r/ship. (a) he doesnt love me as much (b) he prefers the way things are now - minimal communication, sex when he needs it.  hmm..my assessment? instead of giving him the pleasure of getting dumped (he is used to it, no suffering for him)  am just gonna let go of him indirectly. plus, he mentioned abt his K2OC club member (a chick) who is avoiding him and damn if he is not disturbed by it..  *frowns*  so, instead of two nites i only spent one with him. and that was a BAD mistake coz i ended up not having enough sleep ..i know..it was something i am partly accountable for.. *grins* but i was tired by the time i got in at noon and couldnt focus on my work from last week. And today already moving on to a new client site for another 6 weeks..!!! damn...  we read sometimes in mags abt accepting our other half's low-end features.. but fh SNORES!!! godd..it sounded terrrible and his bed is uncomfortable and he was not interested in fun loving acts..simply pure s** !!!! okayla..i slept in his arm the entire nite but that was for him to play with my nipps ..!!!!  all in all... i think that would be the last time  i am sleeping over at his house. and oh oh..i feel so LOST without ladee this time..really!!! it was one heck of a lonely house to live in when she is not around. had to take sleeping pill to go to sleep last nite and boy, how i miss her...

      its close to 5. fh is to come and get me in an hour's time. ladee has took off to langkawi. god..i have never felt this miserable after ladee's absence. weeks ago, this is what i have been waiting for - the chance to spent nites with fh - something we talked abt of doing since we got together. but honestly, i dont even feel like meeting up with him, let alone spent the nite with him at his new place.  funny - 2003 had brought us together and 2004 is just the opposite. this would be our second meet for the year.. *sigh* ..was planning to finally break it off with him after this time. for good. ever since ladee dropped me off this morning to go back to her family for the trip, i have felt so alone and so lonely. i really miss ladee. it has been a long time since i miss her this much. and fh? i am kinda hoping he said something to trigger cancellation on my side..but i know he has been waiting for this day. knew since the day he hinted whether i could come over to his house and have it.. and i know the only motivation for him now is the sex, nothing more. and i dont mind. really. coz it is the same for me. up till this morning that is. but now..  i am not too sure anymore. loving him is no longer what i feel. his love is no longer what i crave.   the worst feeling now is the thot of going back to work. what happened friday was something i didnt think i would get from any managers, let alone my Senior Manager.  Friday - Noon  instead of staying in and go through my presentation again, i accepted LL's invitation for lunch at midvalley with KA, another colleague. Had our lunch at Little Penang. Spent the rest of time reading Grisham's Bleachers at MPH..both of them went window shopping and that is just not my thing.. *smiles*  JD II started at 3.15. Everything was fine, despite loads of changes to be made and, yes, some of it was my mgr's idea so i didnt feel so bad. the day before that, i had this stupid dilemma of either doing the presentation myself or together with my group members. Traditionally, it would be me and i decided so. Man, i was damn nervous. I think all of my bosses could hear the weird ways i was talking in - i have problems maintaining my voice level..   It was all well until it finished. My SM came over to me place and without having any respect of my embarassment over what he was gonna say, belted these to me:  MR: why did u do the presentation alone? why didnt u let the others present as well? trying to take all the credits are you? ME: that wasnt my intention MR: it sure looks like it. NEXT TIME MAKE SURE EVERYBODY PRESENT, UNERSTAND? ME: you got it wrong then. and will do. MR: what happen? all the while u talk so loud and suddenly you go in there and turned into a mouse. ME: (..what the fuck? have u ever heard of the word RESPECT?? ) ..nothing. i was nervous thats all.  and he breezed away leaving me with everyone within the parameter to hear every single fuckiing shit he said.   MC was a great problem- healer, for a while at least. And now, back to my own device i remember it all again and all i wanna do now is hide and never go out for another century.  its ten past 5.. i gotta run..fh is on his way..*double sigh*...

      ..sometimes i am very confused with the things that happen to me.. and my own weaknesses that makes it worse for me..  -i whine - i get offended easily  - i hold grudges over everyone and anyone - i swear and curse - i talk waayyy too much - i am selfish - i want things my way ALL the time  was back late last nite and ladee wasnt home yet. cleaned up the house for fugde - she arrived at 3 this morning - and plomped meself on the sofa and watched something i wasnt fully aware of whatz it abt.. and ladee came home complaining she hasnt eaten the whole day. moi? ate KR at sentral by meself ..good dinner too..since i got time to think and recap what the fuck i had been doing the whole day yesterday and all the stuffs i said to the wrong people..and how i should ALWAYS remember not to reveal my weaknesses to anyone..and yet that is what i tend to do the moment anyone starts being a softy to me..  HOW WEAK CAN A PERSON GET ??????????  i have been having problems , which i believed by now that I have created meself since  i am the paranoid type , and i made up my mind to brush all of it off and just think all the good stuff they have been helping me with..until i made the call and asked M whether she could help me with something work related and she easily said NO.. .  good god..CAN I JUST FOR ONCE NOT THINK OF THE BAD THINGS ????? OR BAD IDEAS ??? OR BAD THOTS???? WHY CANTI BE NORMAL LIKE OTHER PEOPLE - FILTER OUT WHATEVER NOT RELATED AND DONT TAKE IT TO HEART????   ..this is no good. i go the extra mile of wishing fudge is not here so that i can hide in my own black cloud all through out the weekend...  fucked-up me..

      oh-kay..my V-day is so screwed up...apart from the workload and the pressure of getting stuff done and ready for monday battle with my client, i couldnt find time to get ladee anything except a card which i bought weeks earlier..found time to write a letter to her attached with the card...  '..my dearest ladee, its past 11 and charmed just ended.just thot of writing this to you to put together with the card...i couldnt afford to get u ur MNG and i have been tired so weirdly these days..i havenot given u anything for this year but the five years we together have been the most wonderful journey in my life and i wont trade it for anything. ..there is no one who loves me more than you do and i love you as much too.. u have been a very passionate person, the most caring a friend can be and the most loyal of friend, sister and daughter. You are simply beautiful ladee. & i love you. always. your jL..'  ladee gave me a card and a damn big hug the whole afternoon after me came back from work at 4.. :) ..  it has been over a month of us being involved in our own individual world and this morning on the way to work, ladee said she misses our time together.. with nothing in our minds..just us..and its true..i miss it too..  fh has not wished me anything (ie. slmt hari raya/hari raya haji/ VALENTINES) ..he kinda go off on his own ..i mailed him and sms-ed him but no  reply..last year it was on this day we went on our first date..sob!  anyways, to my lovely ppl bloggie-blip-friends.. happy val's day..its ending in ten minutes and i have the most wonderful person ever in my life with me..  i love you so much ladee..all the times we spent together..the nites of endless talking..the comfort we sought and gave .. best of all we are one..  (i couldnt help feel guilty abt the whole shit between me and fh. he WAS special..i thot he was the one for me..but who wants a late 30's divorcee who couldnt care less abt anything then his own dick and his own dick only..? ..i did and it is prolly the biggest mistake in my life which i am pretty sure i will make again ..in the near future..  ......i am human after all.....................

      have real bad sore throat and upgrading it damn real soon to heavy coughing...these few days are pretty crucial to me..loads of discussion going on and first day of next week - 'judge-ment day' ..scarynya.. but since i lead the whole shit, i will be taking responsibility for any 'extra' shit arising from existing shit-load.  M is back from her grandeur-wedding..with a blotchy face and no change in her bitchy attitude. i hate her on sight and hated her presence during working hours.. and now she is back - evil as ever and look down on me as usual...  i gave in to fh. no elaboration. hate my own action but i gave in.   N is back to being chummy with M so there goes our 'friend-ish' ways.. fuck her.   ladee is thinking of quitting her studies. got the calculation for my car loan-too much. donno can survive or not when i start paying, wuts with the house-moving in may, my M.IT if i get it starts in june..*groans*  life is doing its shitty ways on my again.

      i had my 'lunch' with fh today. or rather, he had HIS 'lunch' - ME ...yeap...the 12.00 to 2.45 lunch hour was spent 'lunching' with him..*sigh dreamily* it has been a month anyhow..... unlike evo babe there, it was only ONE trip to the moon and back...too short a time..hahaha...  it all began with one sms around 10am   sms(1): morning dear sms(2): sempat tak lunch hari ni?  sms(3): want me to tapau something?    to shorten the story, the food that he tapau-ed (he bought kfc whole meal set at endah parade) left uneaten by the time we rushed to star lrt station to send me off back to the weld..   honestly, meeting fh very very jarang is better these days.. and this was our first for 2004. after the whole 'i love you - lets be together' phase, we sort of lost words for each other..but we hang on to the r/ship still - (must be the s**) ...*grins* ..   unsurprisingly, there was no sms from him after lunch..so typical of fh... until the next cycle of b.l.u.e.b.a.l.l then only i shall receive sms from him now that he has moved to his own place..  at the end of day, i am happy, he is happy. we got what we wanted and that is all that matters.

      took half day yesterday. had nasi ayam boustead and off to meet ladee at sentral. it was raining  - lebat pulak tu.. havenot been able to sleep for three nites now. fudge says its because i am depressed..but dont think so..the whole hullabaloo on monday dah passed and now this sleepless nites? was planning to get some pills today if last nite same problem - so i guess pills it is ...  ladee asked me to consider letting her go - she believed so much in the 'ramalan jodoh' we did during CNY (according to the makcik, my jodoh is somewhere next year..like i believe that!!!) so she wants the process of letting go to be smooth and painless - on her side that is.. oh pls..like i wont!!!   we been together for five years now - dating back to uni time..think its gonna be easy on me? sometimes when i REALLY concentrate on her touch..the way her skin feels on me.. i felt SO grateful that if not my family at least ladee is here for me. she HAS been there for me all the while - supporting me telling me abt the beauty she sees in me and how she loves me so much sometimes she dont wanna let go..   bought this V-card at the weld  'two hearts together our love is forever i love you!'   hehe..nice tak? gonna buy her perfume for v-day. she hinted M&G (correct or not spelling dunno la..) but thinking of buying dior red door revealed. haha..if she taknak me take la! i tried nina ricci and i lurrved the smell of it...damn nice!!!  oh oh but in v-day got training..sob sob! i remember last year's v day was my first date with fh. we watched 'about schmidt' and late lunch at dave's deli..hmm...*sigh* those were the good times...

      i knew i'd be making a huge mistake buying my tix to penang saturday evening and coming back monday evening.   bus left at 6.30 from ktm and called me mom to inform her. spent the time thinking how can i help in not getting my dad to drive all the way to penang to pick me up .. finally agreed on tol Juru and my parents arrived about the same time i got down. no more than 5 minutes of getting into the car i received   Remark (1): the next time u balik, try and drive instead. THEN u will know the pain of driving a car.  Analysis: O-K..wtf is that for? i really dont like to go over the whole you-have-licence-but-u-never-drive shit.. why? coz i always blame it on my dad for screwing up my driving ability. i took my licence back during uni time and after passing the test my dad prohibits me from using his car to polish up my new skill - by now it has remained as ex-skill since i dont know shit by now how to drive. my sisters used to make stupid promises abt teaching me drive or letting me use their car to practise - but that was also bullshit..  Sunday Morning  Woke up close to 10am. Didnt hear my sister's voice yet so considered okayla. Received  Remark (2): you better stop taking red coffee. ur auntie took it too and ended up bigger than ever. you have grown bigger since the last time we saw u. better do something abt it.   Analysis: give it a rest, can u? that is like the standard remark i get everytime i go back home or whenever they come visiting me in KL.  that had screwed up the day for me. i sometimes wonder (no, actually i often do) what is so fucking wrong having a fat daughter? fudge says i am not fat, rather i am big. oh oh wait for coming remarks..  Sunday Noon  My sister and BIL came for lunch. Not a surprise, i didnt join them lunch. fh decided to call and enchant me abt his moving plan - he is finally moving out from the house (and bed) he shared with jules. Somewhere in petaling indah - i dunno. Asked me if i have extra cash he can borrow. No way! u messed up ur life and u want my money!! TBF, i spent thousands on ladee since five years back but that is different. Ladee loves me, do stuff for me and love me still. but FH? few times of great sex doesnt equalise u to my fund account. in the name of love??? hmm..i am not even sure if i love him still by now..but i sure was thinking abt having him in me again soon..(naughty naughty..)   Sunday Evening  Decided to ikut my sister to penang and have her drop me at fudge's. we were going to M's dinner in the end. I skipped some time with my parents at home and spent more time with a fren whom i had jolly katak for four days just a week ago!  dinner was fab - didnt know if the food was halal or not even! *grins* but we enjoyed nevertheless.. M was wearing this heavily-beaded pink saree and R, her groom was looking great. bought a stupid fruit bowl as a present and found later on the other guests only give ang pow. shit! but wuttodo..bought already and almost all the guests saw the huge boz i was carrying with me..so gave la..   Spent some time at seagate by the beach with fudge - talking, crying our hearts out and that was when the whole shit in my heart started... i know i have problems but i have never really tell anyone EVERYTHING..and i did that night to fudge. god..  Monday - Lunch  Remark (3): why wont u have lunch with us? normally it is just the two of us. we want to have more ppl round the table sometimes..  Analysis: I have had always been a recluse in the house - not dining with the family and it was all just part of me..but i had to and this is wot i got next:  Question (1): Nak mandi bunga?  Analysis: wtf?? told them off that if it was meant to be, then it will be. of course, that wasnt the answer they were looking for..  Monday evening - in the car otw to bus station  Remark (4): It takes an explosion maybe then u'll come back and visit. To simply take leave and come back to see how ur parents are doing, i dont think u will do it.   Analysis: fuck!!! this was it!!! this was the one that kept me crying all the way back to kl last nite..   I hope one day my parents can understand my internal problems and let me be. I wish and want to be a good daughter to them but have i not been one? I dont give them sleepless nites, nor i did anything to get a car of cops coming over and inform them i am dead or arrested or raped or anything..   Ladee was concerned, definitely. Slept in her arms till morning, and wept still. I couldnt explain why but i feel so rotten abt everything ME...

      m so farking sleepy. been getting up at 5 and coming back around 9 daily..thanks to the new job i do now..sob!  another project meeting yesterday. after da bomb monday, my PM is a bit shaky abt the whole thing. we lagi la..no direction, no support. what is there to continue then..?  my eyes are red now. tahan mengantuk and its only 8.28 am ...*groans* why oh why   my boss is back from 2-days course. boring..! my other committee work is still pending. dunno when nak buat ler..  the car is wobbling.ladee said no. i think yes. oh oh speaking of ladee, i remember a blog i read months back. it was a gal and the blog is dedicated to her and her by, aptly called baby ( evo, like urs loh!) so the entries went abt the things she did daily with each and single one of it never done without the knowledge of her baby and the baby's permission.. okay, CUTTTT!!!  was reading the review for The Eye 2. Hmm...reminds me (again..?) of stephen king's red rose on astro. one of the reasons i got the astro..hehe..too bad to takut to finish all three parts of it..damn takut man...  another day at work....

      yesterday wasnt a good day. had a meeting with my project owner and..lets just say the result was one we didnt expect.. sigh..  made up my mind to take half day leave when i got back to office at 11. called up ladee to pick me up at 1. she went to settle some stupid probs with her Masters' supervisor and then came for me.. yay! sent her off to office and went back home.. it was only around 2 plus at the time and was feeling restless..got connectec and went to some of my fave P sites..nothing interesting there...hmm...what else...oh oh lets chat then..so off i went on a search for something/someone to get off with..  Lesson learnt: the 'in' gadget to talk to ANYONE is to have a cam installed..most of them started off with "you got a cam?" ..and it totally turned them off when i replied a sadistic NO..hehehe..  finally someone who was willing to bargain for less...he let me view his cam..hmm..nice jugak...so did some imagination of my own..and voila..!!!!   had early dinner and went to pick ladee around 9..found out later the whole H feeling was due to my oncoming period..shoulda known....  post scriptum: i am officially her driver these days... sob! sob!

      was thinking of the song by kci and jojo (my song with ladee that is) and hence the title..cos the song started like 'baby baby baby baby.....' hmm..nice..  already my second day driving to work. no more hassle in the lrt for me!!! hehehe... ladee followed me from behind and went straight (more like patah balik actually, me kl she pj) to work..i am still a bit nervous to drive alone to work.   the funny part (which i believe would be a joke material if mentioned to ANY of y colleagues) is that i got up and 5 and got out of the house by 6.30~ reaches office by 7...*smiles weakly* i am still afraid of federal highway..sob!  but, ladee has been a good teacher ever since i cried sunday. guess she knows now that i am really no good when she is around..hehehe..  my on-site work ending today..yipppeeeee....but next week will be swamped with project work..*sigh*.. but at least no more going to that stupid building at pudu area..heheh....  ~and i will never find another lover sweeter than you...and i will never find another lover more precious than you...u r close to me u r like my mother (so ironic no..? ) so close to me u r like my sister...~ i used to cry when i go back for semester break when i hear this song coz then i would really miss her...my ladee

      am listening pretty often to the songs suga suga and this love. the latter, surprisingly is by Maroon5. Funny. Esp after the vid clip for Harder to Breathe. The vid clip for this love is.. S.w.e.e.t!!!! too sweet..!!!! suga suga is kinda feel eeky song when u listen too much to it..but the vid clip is nice.   was ironing my baju this morning to Jutawan Fakir on ABO. hmm...the guy was definitely over acting..  after much pushing and calling and explaining why i am urgently needing my passcard, my admin passed me hers to use. temporarily that is. been chasing the admin dept of several depts to get a card for free parking in the basement. AND NOW THAT I GOT IT, I HAVE COLD FEET ABT DRIVING TO WORK!!!!  i know..it might sound silly but my short-lived epxerience on thursday, saturday and sunday had left this huge marks on me abt driving. I am scared of changing lanes, taking over another car and even cornering!!!!  ladee said i am 'okay' already but there were comments for every single fucking  ops. to be continued..

      the special assignment turned out to be a grammar and spelling check for my dept's newly proposed sumthing..cheh! i was thinking a trip to HK ke..NY ke..hehhe..  so i get to stay inside office today to do the special assignment..but, strangely i feel so detached. from everything. my colleagues, my office, my day, everything. its like i am alone at my cubicle and i havent talked to anyone in ages. zero communication and i am like invisible to everybody else.  after quite some time, played dont know why (norah jones) and boy oh boy it sure does bring back memories of me and fh (wtf??? thot u dont with him??? :)) just like some other songs as: -> your body is a wonderland -> dont know why -> i think there is more but couldnt recall since the lurrrveee has gone down the hill...  *smiles*  speaking of fh, no harm in updating .. :) we havenot communicated in what so ever ways since last friday. he sms-ed me at noon telling that he was at home eating maggi for lunch (*this is a hint that he is AT HOME so that my mind would catch it and eureka! to go to his house for a lunch fuck - which i didnt layan since i was enjoying a nice nasi ayam kampung near Jamek). I replied few hours later asking him why he was at home. His reply was "saja..it is my home..." - how rude can a person be? to express his frustration over not getting a free fuck by giving such answer. Okay, some might say 'what is so rude abt that?' ..knowing fh as well as i do, that WAS his rude way of telling me off for not giving in to what HE wants..  and SO, that was it-lah! until today..and hopefully forever.. i love ladee very much and i wanna be with her. always.   he mentioned ada this one time abt a person can only be happy in ways that he want to be happy and if it means using someone else for it, so be it lah! hmm...am i making him happy - and only him happy - by letting him go into me like dat? yeah, it was delicious but the other side of the whole shit sucks!   oh well..

      hmm..life has been a big wave of work assignments..and not to mention project work! i can barely keep up with the whole thing. And just read mail from me boss that i am getting a new assignment monday. sigh..   on the cheerful side tho, i have settled the whole hullabaloo abt my car. i took leave (with much pain, btw) and went to JPJ for registration, rushed to LHDN for stem hasil and then rushed to my office to collect my check. We both got out of the house (ladee took leave too) by 7 and by 3.30 i was driving away my new car..!!!! yay!!!  initially it was disastrous. ladee keep giving me the 'hummpphhss' and 'ish-es' when i a bit laju and when i am a bit careless when i wanna turn.. hey, gimme a break okay! i hadnt driven a single blardy car since i first got my licence. but i was okay. didnt bump into anything, at least!  so now, me and ladee have our 'family car' ..hehehe...like we r gonna have kids or sumthing..NOT!!!!  had a meeting with my project champion at 4 and as i expected. everbody was busy sucking up to him, esp the bloke who worked in UK ..sheesh!!!  all the while, i was dreaming abt my new car, what should i call it..what i wanna put in it...when can i dirve the car back to home town...heheh... havent told my ma abt it tho. only my subang sister. my other sister no need la...she drives a kancil and my other sister a wira. i am the odd one out..  hmm..wanna give it a feminine name btw.. letitia??? lolitta..??? suga??? hahaha...

      it was a very complicated yet it was not, tiring yet it wasnt a damn tiring one - my recent weekend.  its 6.45 in the morning and for some crazy hormon-ish reactions in my body i got up early this morning - even before azan subuh! my eyes were already klip-klop and heck - bangun je lah!  my first project meeting was recent saturday. turned out all the other members were abt my age in the company, but they have this monstrous confidence in the small of their back - making them look like the most arrogant hunchbackerz of Notre Dame ..   "huh huh - i am gooooodddd..gimme gimme gimme..."   found out one of them have had 5 projects before and worked in UK; another 3 has been in the company for more than 10 years and know just abt anybody in that stupid grey building; an indian gal was so chirpy i couldnt help but virtually clipped her lips together and feed it to the burung gagak in my head;the project leader just got back from US and still damned new to the dept and the way things work; the secretary talks like she invented English language hence the proper fucking pronounciation of everything ("did i miss out(tt) anything(kk)") and keep writing and writing in her standard minutes template; myself - the kampung lady. *what a team*  spent sunday doing a 20-pages assignment for ladee- she simply refused to do it despite having to submit it tuesday. so i did. had dinner at subang parade. was inspecting a chevrolet-something and thot why in the world cant i afford this car..(sigh...)  shit! still need to iron my baju...

      ..i couldnt help but write abt this. wish someone good nite and the reply i received ended with pundek! :P   god..has it been that long since i was a small kid swearing at the boys for using the badminton court by the time we got there to play galah panjang? i remember all the profanities in me : cibai - pundek - (kote also is a nice word to use sometimes) - butuh - puki - finger pointing - finger clipped to form puki - and god knows what other ingenous ways to maki ... *smiles at my past *  somewhere along the line during high school, it got to me that all the swearing did was only humiliate us gals more..almost all the words were referring to our pussy and only a few refers to men's dick. how fair iz that..????  the revelation to the word fuck was a great one - till this farking day.. only now i dont just say it, i do it! genious! simply brilliant!!! Malaysia boleh..!!! hahaha...

      ..i went to the theater with JH. i was rooting to go and watch intolerable cruelty and ladee wasnt gonna layan me to go and watch it. so when JH said she wanted to, i grabbed the opportunity. but the ony option yesterday was midvalley and midvalley it was ..   'someone' said that the movie wont be entertaining but of course i dont believe her..let ME be the judge of it..and see where i landed..??? there was only like 5 ppl in the theater and none were really laughing at ANYthing on screen...cheh! rugi only la!!!  called ladee the minute movie ended coz i was only thinking of getting a shower at the time. but ladee was still in office and wont come until another half hour. spent the time checking out long skirts if there is any at all that fits me..while talking to fudge that was..she called and we talked a bit abt my 'losing-my-religion-episode' during ladee's absence last week and a bit on fh..she misses her NuSkin i think but she is trying to be cool abt it..poor fudge..almost blurted out abt enrique iglesias to her but didnt. it will be only ME and LADEE only..no one else!! i wanna enjoy my SI TU TE VAS this time.. LIVE!!! yay!!!!  it was a busy morning today. had a disc from 9.30 to 12 noon. and just right before disc started, fh hinted abt lunch ("wanna come and see my newly installed water heater?" ) ...and foolishly, i fell for it.. :( so off to his place again today. went to sentral and he picked me up there. since yesterday we've been talking abt (a) wanna maintain this way or convert to fucking buddies (b) still love each other or not (c) are we doing this due to love @ lust @ love + lust and the result... drumrollll  i. he is okay with the idea ii. he is having some problem with ex-wifey so cant really tell if he loves me or using me for sex iii. he is convinced that i wont be able to survive without the sex (with him)  hmm...now what..??? i dunno.. i think ladee saw his sms when she was clearing out my inbox this morning - she does that - all the time.. sigh... and the one still in my phone is the one that goes like "i love making love to you" .. and some of gm's too.. that one okay la...she knows i been talking dirty with people.. grins.  gonna kemas and go back now.  have loads to do over weekend....  junkie-loves-ladee-loves-lickerish-

      ..everything went fine..yay!!!!minor glitch here n there..but all in all..I MADE IT !!!!!!!  => i couldnt help but feel disturbed by fh's doing. what the fuck is wrong with me? i already promised myself to put an end to everything and yet here i am..thinking of what he is doing now. is he with the gal? are they already doing it? is he belting out all his stoopid charms already? which was mine not too long ago?   jules..i guess this is what i get. i know i stole him from you and now..i guess i know how u feel now. the only difference is that i didnt depend or put too much hope of him marrying me like u did. and look what have become of us...?   there is really nothing special abt him.so why am i so hooked on him? and so ungrateful of me to simply brush ladee off when she is the one i am supposed to love..ONLY..and not dividing my love to two people and only one of them is returning it. even much more than what i give.  i watched unfaithful on astro last week and there was a scene when diane lane was crying and eventually decided to end the whole thing with that young guy and return back to her family. esp her husband. ladee asked me why she cried and how i wish i could tell her coz i really know how it feels..the catch22 feeling..and how tiring the whole event is..living with a person who expects the whole of u is for him/her and only him/her. yet, while loving one person here, a poortion in ur heart is yearning for another's touch. another's love. i definitely know how exhausting it was.  but it didnt come to me willingly. i was persistent at the time. fh was EVERYTHING at the time, even if it means leaving ladee behind. how stupid i was at the time.   look how it is now. who is the one hugging me at nite kissing me to sleep. who wakes up and prepare hot drink when her other half couldnt sleep due to asthma, when she herself came back after a days work and class at 11 at nite, with possible missed lunch and dinner ? when she herself was so tired she collapsed on the bed the moment she arrived home?   who rushed home from shah alam at nite, risking her own life when her other half was crying when she called to tell her she is coming back and prolly arrive in an hour's time?  all is said, and yet i am still thinking of fh. i am the bitch in this r/ship. sometimes i wish ladee can just kill me so that i dont have to live with this guilt in me.

      now that i a moving to a new house, i take the chance to ..ops   half hour later.. thot of checking out the blogs i surfed in sometimes.. like  urlLink susan's  ..enjoyed her pics and there were a bunch taken during her shopping trip to Ikea..a pic and few more on herself eating meatballs at Ikea Rest & Cafe..sudenly i froze. remembered jules, fh's live-in girlfriend forced him to go with her some time ago to Ikea to eat meatballs..sob! now i am reminded of him..AGAIN!!!! aarrgggh...how la... like dis die la..asik teringat pulak..few weeks before this i was glad he was not in the pic at all and now..hmm...post-breaking up trauma i suppose..   another blog is  urlLink dona adura's  ..her pics also interesting..i love to go to hers sometimes..when i am done knowing what has been going on with my blog mates, JulietAlive and my shy-guy loser :) I would love to have the friendship to grow but yeah, same concern as before like what Eve once said in her blog abt letting the world know who u are..which would depend on what u treat the blog as: confidante? diary?   given the 'confusion' i was and still in, i would say i'd go public (real name, pixies etc) only when i turn straight. not while i am still juggling with the emotional coaster. not yet. not when the centre of my universe has a set of boobies and butties..

      weekend was tiring: saturday was my quality-time spending with my sister and sunday was family day.   monday was filled with ISO work. same goes to tuesday i predict.  => forget_him made an entry in his online journal (refer recent entry) which was obviously meant for me to read it. it made my heart melt a  bit la.. we did had quite a time ..and NO, the anniversary crap was not even an issue..see how he put it? *smirk* sms-ed him abt it and he replied saying something abt being frens and going out for lunch or dinner some time.. hmmm....  => i got my promotion yesterday. doesnt sound so exciting now does it? but one cannot not be thankful...          31.25 %          My weblog owns 31.25 % of me.  urlLink Does your weblog own you?

      .& so it finally happened...  ever since bila tah... we never meet up again.. even when i  was right d/stairs in maybank.. :-/ the last time was at my  place (i think)... sigh, & now this... as u'd always  say 'wuttodo'.....  so that was it... announcement came in 1 year & 2 days  after declaration... maybe bcoz i didn't wish the  anniversary thingy, but it's known fact that i'm not into  that... well, msg & mailed but too little reply, nothing  much can do.. can even call during those lonely nites - a  big risk..  it was certainly a 'long phase' huh..? a long good one.. it  was everything, enjoyable, fun, sad, heartache, conflicts  etc.. well, now all back to what we were as before, i mean  u.. me not the same anymore - live alone already...   anyway, part of me feels glad that u r much more happier  now. maybe u've found the answer to that  puzzling 'orientation' question.. confirm not a bi- huh..?  maybe we'll meet again in few years time.. who knows... for  now i'll keep everything in me... the best ngumpat/gossip  session, best borak & of course one of the best sex - on  the phone & off the phone.. gonna miss that tight, slippery  wet pussy & sensitive tits... stimulating moans &  groans/screams better stop thinking abt that, no good.. no good for lonely  little bro... :-S  bye love... take care & please don't let her walk all over  u... be strong & pls go ahead with masters degree plan..  ~love~

      PD was okay..i guess.. i managed to finish some long overdue work and she got to do HER work so i guess it went well.. the only glitch was:  = i found out i didnt get promoted saturday, while the other 80% of my peers got it =   ..and that screwed up my hols..was too distracted to enjoy the sea. no news from fh at all this this very farking moment..guessed it alright and i can bet my vagina on this: at least ONE sms will come on friday..hahaah...  my knees are bruised, my heart is wounded and my head is spinning...was so reluctant to come to office and face my frustration...sigh..   i miss blogging over the weekend..thot of evo. hmm..when will she resurface i wonder.. got online last nite but my stupid browser and it cookie shit didnt allow me to check out the latest entry in my frens' blogs..sigh...hadda wait to come to office still..  its 10 am. i am feeling.. hurt. i deserve the promotion. i hoped to get it and my SM sorta made the promise..  i cry inside

      took half day leave friday - wanted to share the experience of sending my car for the first 1G service - which i regret later coz it was such a waste of time when i can always get ladee to do it for me. anyway that wasnt what triggered my annoyance so early  in the morning.   woke up with a '1 message received' .. content: 'morning...' sender: fh   hmm..today is friday no wonder la.. recalled the email he sent to me wednesday:  From :  fh  Sent :  Wednesday, April 07, 2004 7:09:34 PM  To    :  jL  Subject :  RE: friday, monday.. what day..?     hmm.. it's been many many days... kan..?  am not working this fri onward... prepare for exam la konon...  maybe u wanna come over fri noon.. can relax a bit from ur busy schedule.. that is IF can lah... am not going anywhere on fri...   c ya love...    => i didnt reply his sms. was thinking this is part of him 'charm' plan to get me to his place.. no way jose..my day is planned already but i sure wont tell him that.. and so...as expected another sms came in shortly...  'what is the possibility of a get-together this afternoon? Y or N is sufficient. No need to explain the reasons'   okay - that hurts. big time.    my reply hours later - 'n'   whats with the indirect persistence? see, his actions these days do not invoke the passion in me at all. instead, all i could think of everytime he mentioned meeting up is the fact that he wants to get laid. period.  fuck the whole jL-fh collaboration.sexually, mentally anything! Nada!!!   am gonna enjoy my time at pd with ladee and that is IT..!!!!

      a fren of mine sent a disturbing mail yesterday. told ladee abt the mail. and then she remarked:  'u tak perasan ke all these people asked u those Qs becoz they dont think u can actually buy a car, let alone driving one?'   oh! then it hit me. Ya hor...no wonder la.. ever since i let it known to SOME people in the dept that i am now a proud owner of a car the Qs (standard ones, by now) that were asked to me: a. betul ke? b. so now u drive-lah? c. hari ni bawak tak ke office? d. parking kat mana?  hmm...why like dat one...so jahatla these people.. and now JH, a colleague who competes with me in ANYTHING & EVERYTHING emailed telling she is thinking of getting an ATOZ too... copycat betull!!!

      weekend was...as i described to my SM - 'wet' ..it rained both afternoons ...naturally he was already on  a dirty cruise, mind-wise..   news flash: the tenants are moving out end of the month. hence, me and ladee is forced to move into the house early May. you see..ladee's mom got this nice place rented out to a couple of UM students in PJ. ladee has had always wanted to move closer to her family - duty of the eldest, what can i say... so the mom offered for us to move in. the original plan is in June and so we have ample time to leisurely pack our things and move quietly by then. However, given the news yesterday while enjoying cendol and rojak at her house after a quarrel in A&W during lunch..guess we r gonna have to speed things up ..a lot!  the Quarrel..right... hmm..a first in months..i cried..as usual.. a trick to soften her up..hehehe... and it worked as usual..i got my way in the end..   so we spend our afternoon till evening packing up her books and my novels and her study-related stuff which took the whole four shelves previously..  wet wet wet weekend..

      from:jack@yahoo.com hello there..the angel in my nightmare ...   say what..? hmm..i am starting to feel weird abt this whole thing with the guy. had a long chat with him over the phone last nite and it reminded me so much of how me and FH hooked up in 2002...  jack (5:18:58 PM): i like you too junkie_lady (5:19:11 PM): hmm jack (5:19:20 PM): annoyingly tempting  never had anyone said i am annoyingly tempting.. hahaha..but i sense the same old charm that FH put on my before. we talked abt our recent love-event and he just broke up too. hmm.. sounds like a classic get-together eh.. u r hurt, i am hurt lets heal each other ...  oh god.. i am still thinking of him.. post-breakup syndrom possibly..?

      hmm. this is a guy i recently met over the net. apart from bumping into a guy who was previously my indirect client.. (hmm) this guy knock on my desktop and we hit it off right away..  within 12 hours after our conversation, i received a call from him. and another one two hours later.   the literal chemistry is there. i hope. i really like his ways, literally that is. limited assessment but that was how it was with FH before. great chemistry and good ocnversations all the way...the only other difference was that this guy is a year older..so much better than FH..  FH IM'ed yesterday afternoon. I didnt reply any coz he messaged only to ask abt his wanting to use my claim benefits to claim his rm750/= new glasses. WTF????   oh oh..i couldnt stop smiling after jack called me, the first time. *giggles* reminds me of my sekolah time..gatal!!!

      hmm..went for Troy saturday. despite having to sit two rows from the screen (thank god it was a small theater) i enjoyed the movie thoroughly. b.pitt was great, and e.bana was good. too bad both died at the end of the movie..(e.bana died in the hands of b.pitt and the fighting scene was fab!) .. i read the review in the Star and cant believe i believed the review.sometimes i think the reviewers were too critical abt ALL movies..rarely can u get a movie rated 'A' ... oh prolly my mind is not as critical and they appreciate the movie better hence the flaws were too damn apparent to them....all in all it was a great movie still!  life hasnt been good. despite the two trips to the moon this morning, when i reach office( i was late, thanks to the trips she took me with..or in..heheeh) the whole work-client-colleague-sucks thingy got to me and i groaned inside..  news flash! i am officially a RACIST!!! hehehe...not like KKK but given the option (and immunity from getting thrown into jail) i would have killed the bitch who TUMPANG my car last week.  location: pusat bandar dmsr heading to semantan, slope going up the hill) driver  : ME car owner : ME bitch : a colleague in my project bitch's bitchy remarks : 'jL, this is the way u drive aaah? i dont know what time-lah u got home everyday..!!!' Me : 'its the car-lah! 1.0 only mah! plus penuh mah!' bitch: 'my kelisa can go up the hill easily, and it is also 1.0 what??? just press harder the accelerator lah! ' Me: (red faced, felt like stopping by the side to kick her at her pussy so that her 'boyfriend who live in PJ and have a place I can go and sleep at during noon' cant fuck her no more and had to opt for her asshole) i dont want to press on it hard and thats that!'   MOTS - do not tumpang any one who sembah an elephant god!!!!   comprende????

      been reading a certain blog these days - thanks to  urlLink loser  (got the link from his side) though could not/ would not link up the blog to mine. why? hmm..lets just say the blogger has set her/his place wayyy aboce us mortals.. a certain entry in his/her blog would reflect my reason as jealousy. nahh..maybe a bit but not so much to the extent of wanting to put her/his name here and say something bad abt the blog or the bloggers.   anyways, my time here might end any day. back to my old ways of chatting and flirting - thanks to fh. because of him, i stopped back in 2003 and because of him, i am back at it again.   took EL yesterday and ended up spending my day chatting up some men in a chat room in YM. initially it was pretty weird, been so long since i started describing myself wearing flimsy nighties or anything..hahaha..and the descriptions range from jLo to Oprah..anything that turn the men on..hahah..  was still checking out his mail. and imagestation..and friendster..and another site i couldnt recall but read some messages from him to some ladies he was trying to ngorat2 with his ways i was so familiar with..hmm..  another blog i like to read nowadays is KookyCookie, from JA's. Her entries are fun to read despite not knowing who the heck is she and why is she like what she is as she describe herself in her blog..

      hmm.life is no good coz my toilet cum bathroom still not finished renovation. sigh. been taking my bath at ladee's mom's house and its terrible. we came back late at nite and the mother would be asking..where we were..why we r back so late..like kids only..!!!  read JA's before entering this..yeah..my life is not going as interesting as i want it to be.. its all work these days and trying to get as much sleep as possible while at the same time trying to unpack my stuff without getting dust into my nose which would in turn change me into a sneeze-o-machine..!!!   also, been jotting down my food intake. read in the May RD that if u jot down what u eat and have a look at it after some time, it will inspire u to try and cut down food u seem to be forking in very often. interesting! well, he didnt actually said it in that manner but something like dat la! but no change for me yet. still flushing down nasi lemak in the morning and something carbo-rich in the afternoon ...sigh...  on-site work finally picking up.   oh oh just realised fh has changed his email password. damn! i know i know..said i dont love him anymore but still go and look thru his email..ala.. curious ..plus he always get these nice porny pics which i wont get from him. like, he wont forward those to me. anyhow its history now i suppose..

      hmm..weekend was bad..ladee wasnt around. gone up north to teman her mom for a wedding in kuala ketil.. (??) anyways, was left to my own device and roughly, there wasnt much that i wanna do without ladee..  work is going badly. still disturbed by the tiny link with fh. yeap. fh. he wanted to (still) make the rm750 claim using my staff benefit even after i broke up with him.sigh. whyla..so obviousla..love can stop, money transaction cannot. it must be because of the false receipt he made the kedai produce for him. see, the actual amount is rm450 but can claim punya pasal, he asked the guy to put in extra rm300 for me to claim for him. hell no!!! i can convert the points to ringgit at year end why should i waste 750 pointd for a guy i never wanna see again? ...  concern abt JA. hmm..all the while i read abt greenman and this happened..she is a tough gal i reckon..so no need to worry too much aah JA..*kisses*  miss loser tho..

      hmm. how to start this..  we moved out saturday morning. the whole event took more than 4 hours, finishing at close to 5pm. ladee's sister helped. we moved like only a floor above her mother.. sigh..IT IS her mother's house anyway. ladee decided to upgrade certain areas in the house; initiating a renovation-sort-of starting sunday till this very day. we have to 'tumpang' mandi at her mom's place since the reno involves the bathroom and the house was and still very dusty. i cant unpack anything yet and have to endure the calling from her family members for her to do stuff every now and then, including to babysit few cousins who stay with em. sigh.. we managed to go out for hellboy monday nite and even then the family called her cellphone for god-knows-what while we were in the theatre.  and this morning, i was rushing to come to office early and she took her sweet time at her mother's place and when we were in the car informed me that we hadda go and sent the cousins to school..wtf..???? i mean, i wouldnt mind if that was very fucking early in the morning..but..sigh..nevermind..as someone said to me.. 'jL, why must u get agitated so easily..? relax. take things easy..' yeah rite..  had to korek some of my savings to cover my expenses for the month. i didnt think the moving shit would cost me a bomb! oh well...  loser has left the building i see..hmm...thanks for the 'tribute' loser..u have been great to me too..with the YM la ur V-mail to me..hehehe..  JA..hope ur trip  balik kampung  was great. sorry abt ur G-gramma tho..

      it started off with the sms i sent to half the number in my hp. 'take a moment and listen to ur heart. what does it love? now..type it and sms to me..' ..these are the replies i got:  FH: huh?  Fifi: God.. Sparrow: ..u must have read the starmag this morning...my heart loves...sleeping time..!! Jugsy: someone special in my life LMT: is this wrongly sent to me? LLL: eh! what love love so early in the morning ah??  The others thought i had mistakenly sent the sms and never replied. one told me this morning no credit to reply. one told me it caused his wife to scold him for having an affair with whoever the person who sent the sms to him..(poor him..)...  Anyway, that was the sms which triggered the long sms session with FH yesterday. he replied hours later about failure to come up with something good to answer.   And so...that was that..he told me that he has this void thingy in him now and he dont know why he is not happy when he should be. told him that yeah he should coz all he cares abt is only himself and that is what he has now ..not a single gf to think of..but too bad he got no one to fuck as well...hence the weekly invitation to me to go and 'have a go' with him..which i have declined faithfully every week..  eventually the conversation went to our break up and his asking me again if i wanna do it with him - something like helping each other satisfying each other's needs....h-e-l-l-o...no way man...told him that it still hurts to be talking to him.  and he has started using 'baby' and 'sayang' on me yesterday..no denying i melted (partially) but had come to my senses pretty quickly...no more la with him..  sigh...

      every where i hear talks of Euro 2004..know shit abt it tho..being a person who has no interest in football. so what HAS been my interest???  Interest (1) : Channel 16. being spending more and more of my TV time catching up on songs. getting ready to work, ironing, preparing food .. surprisingly my favorite song from the Sweden (i think) group PLAY only recently touched base in Malaysia. Caught the song few times on Ch16. I remembered looking for the mp3 for the song over the net sumwhere last year and couldnt find any full version of it. And the local music stores also dont have the cd too. sigh. and now..it seems to be on Ch16 very very often. what song u ask? I must Not Chase The Boy. The song rocks ladies and gentleman...!!!! very very nice..  Interest (2) : Local BM mags. It must have grown out of boredom to ride the bus during icey's absence. cant seem to be able to unhook meself from em now!  Interest (3) : FH. (..wtf..??) yeah i know i know...check out this sms i received yesterday.. "visiting someone else's heater today?" and "care for old times' sake ?" huh...what does he take me for ? The only interest is on following his 'ngorat' act towards a gal named Athira. hmmm..see if he get to take her to bed soon... *winks..  Interest (4) : Bad Boys. A novel i bought damn cheap at Popular store near my office. By Olivia Goldsmith. Not bad the story. Reminds me of I'll take Manhattan by err..someone..   apart from these, my whole synergy is focused on getting my relationship with Ladee back on a harmonious track. It was not so good recently. I snapped whenever she said something i hate and THEN she would snap at me back. No more intimacy too..the only fun thing now is that she been calling me kuch-ing and me calling her bear..hehehe..she is such a BEAR...  work is finally coming to a calmer territory of the sea. much calmer. STUDY comes into the picture now.   JA..i miss u babe..hope to be able to read ur blog everyday after this..

      no.. not talking abt my first sex..or my first period..or my first orgy.. nope..my first car accident..yeap..  i was, and still experiencing the aftermath of a bad viral fever. my work was not, and still not, going very well. most of the time this week i wish i could jump into a well and be done with my life. financially i am so broke i could start doing GRO work on part time basis..   so, when the accident happened i felt like my world has gone and stab me to death with its events..   venue: federal highway, few hundred metres away from Hilton exit time : 6-ish pm destination: ladee's office in PJ who got hit: ME (and a naza ria in front of me) who hit me : a proton which apparently was from Kelantan; a family of 5; father drove the car current status: => accident reported to police  => car is in a slum-cum-workshop in puchong => told car + insurance claim etc would take at LEAST three weeks  i was not injured. thank god for that. mentally still replaying the whole scene: if i hadnt stopped too close to the car in front of me, my car wouldnt have to be towed last nite. idiot me!  proton behind me suffered similar damage. but to hell with him . i was the sandwhich there. they didnt even apologise to me after we were done with the police last nite.  am delaying to continue my work. cant seem to think straight ever since the blardy car hit mine.   * JA babe..jack-story would have to wait...

      ..when&nbsp;we first broke up back in ..errrmm..April i think, FH continued to ask me (more like ******) me to continue ********on those friday afternoons..just as the way it was before. My attempt to stop him at the time was by saying that i am already with *********..  the thing is, i should have known him better. he pestered me abt this guy every now and then.."how is he in bed?", "what do u call him?" and the list goes on..i replied vaguely since it wasnt the truth and i didnt want him to know abt me and ladee still together bla bla bla..(long storyy) ...  ..until yesterday he asked me another Q and i asnwered in the same grey-ish manner and then he dropped the most irritating reply i have ever got from him.."funny, i have doubt about his existence" ...fucker betul..i mean, who is he to pass such remark.. ? it was all along a lie but has he the right to doubt&nbsp; this other new guy ? wtf? unfortunately being the immature person that i am, i snapped... hmmm..  anyways, ladee is starting to come home later and later and end up sleeping on the couch..and when she did go to bed, i was a nobody to her no more..resulting in me sleeping not within her warm hug and constant kisses...uwaaa...!!!! i miss ladee..  &nbsp;

       hahaha...sorry JA..this one come about after reading ur sister's entries in her blog of her only sister... i wish i have (if not both of them) a sister who would write something beautiful like that abt me. heck, i dont think&nbsp;my sisters even know me that well and like-wise.  &nbsp;  you see..my eldest sister is 5 years older and the second one is 2 years older. they clique together but not with me in it. somehow. they shared a beautiful sisterhood i suppose (like the one u and anne has) and i am pretty sure they only love each other.  &nbsp;  one comment i would never forget was when my second sister, IJA refused to go out with me. i was back home during semester break and i was so bored out of my skull that i just asked her if she wanna go out with me. her answer was that she would NEVER EVER go out with me. and why is that i wonder... of course i didnt spend much brain cells on the 'whys' and just simply start hating her. period.  &nbsp;  moving and living in kl didnt change much between me and both my sisters (one is INA and one is IJA).&nbsp; they dont exactly care what i do. we barely talk to each other and only meet up when i am back in my parents' house. my role to them these days is to listen to their problems and whiney stories abt their families, financial problems and sometimes husband-wife problems. yucky..and they dont really care to ask me abt my life here..if i have problems ...the only thing they care to ask if i have a boyfriend to marry.  &nbsp;  i guess the lack of bonding with my family tightens my bond with ladee.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  do i love INA &amp; IJa..? cant say. maybe i dont. coz i am positive they dont love me. nor care abt me.  &nbsp;  ..like-wise.........  &nbsp;

       ..after&nbsp; 4 weeks of classes, life has finally come to a routine exercise that i got sick of sometimes..     &nbsp;   monday  - first day of the week. definitely the worst one in terms of work but no class today. due to site work, no way of spending time in office to do work cum blog cum chat cum mp3 etc.. able to stay back till up to 8 or 9 ... however, going back late means picking up ladee ladee and having dinner late..hence i might miss Fear Factor..     &nbsp;   tuesday  - sometimes i have meeting at head office or in the office itself for either one of the committees i am in ..joined cmmA last year and we have succeeded in getting our department ISO certification. joined commB early this year and had been busy planning and executing programs for this committee. either these or back to client site. have to come in early though (before 8) coz i have to chao by 5 to catch my network lab for my masters. lab from 5 to 7 so i have been reaching quite late but at least we are by ourselves unsupervised or anything so its okay to come late. lab ends at 7 so i will reach ladee prolly by 7.30 and after the standard waiting time of 1/2 hour then we'll go for dinner. then rush home to catch zoe busiek's wild card and L&amp;O - SVU...    &nbsp;   wednesday  - check in to office before 8 to chao by 5. class on wednesday is damn crucial to arrive early since what he taught was something i will NEVER find on the net for references...hmm...wednesday also sometimes i have  urlLink cmmA@B  meetings or anothing head office commC meeting to attend to. else, back to client office... since CSI has wrapped up last week there is no longer a rush to get home early..unless i decided to catch Charmed on wed instead of re-run on sunday.. dinner would be late as well...heck, we have dinner late EVERY fucking day now!!!    &nbsp;   thursday  - also have class today but this one i can easily kautim and come in late since the guy only use slides which are pre-printed so no need to rush to come in early..plus the pattern is the same every time: lecture 6 - 7.30 and tutorial 7.30 to 8.30 and presentation 8.30 - 9.00 ...pretty standard but this means even later dinner with ladee. hmm..i would be most hungry this particular day.. thursday normally is a client office day..rarely anything happens thursday at work..    &nbsp;   friday  - a.k.a monday ..i dont do much this particular day..laid back a bit and simply go with the flow of things...my 12 - 2.45 lunch is normally spent doing nothing sweaty.. i dont really go out window shop or anything. YM chat would be best done during this time.. friday is also me &amp; ladee's wayang nite..normally sunway is our first option since i get to book it early.. but since something happened last nite i reckon no wayang today lerrr.... this is also the day when i come back from client office i'll be like so relax and surf the net and check out stuff till time to go and fetch ladee..    &nbsp;  => i hate driving at nite. there was one fucker tailing me like mad yesterday. damn fucker!!!    => i hate coming back home tired every nite.. there is just so much i need to kemas at home...sob!!!    &nbsp;  => ladee, if u read this..i do NOT want what happened last nite to happen again..comprende????    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      that was what FH would include in his final sms or final YM messages..i have grown fed-up with it. thinks it's sweet kot...initially yeah but now that the tie is broken and i am so busy i have no time to think of him or Finny or jack ...i got sick oof that same stupid item when i read my offline messages this morning.   cont'd on thursday morning -   started off my day with cookiekookie's blog.. hmm..not a good choice since after her latest entry, i realised i am  most likely  facing my 2-years-past-Quarter-life-crisis now. how so..? hmm...i'll be the keeper of the answer..   moved on to GM's ..no change since last one. hey GM! thanks for the call man..too bad u were around for only a day! and i was too busy on-site too..  cross-over to my fav babe: julietAlive. hmm.no change too..where could she be..been a while since we last mailed each other.   turned back and reached my own blog. oopsy..one new comment. guessing its from loser. saw him online yesterday but was rushing to go to class. didnt get to say hi. sorry baby!  clicked the link at GM's to Que Sarah .. hmm... obviously a student. soon to go out to the real world and become one of us..slaving ourselves for the love of money..which never seem to be enough..  i hate life. i hate MY life. ladee isnt doing so good too. making more mistakes than ever at work, even made the really huge mistake of quoting RM4mil to a customer..hehehe..pity her..nothing much i can do..struggling with my WXGA6105 now. sigh...  been few days since i last heard from FH. hmm..ada ikan baru la ni...as usual..once rejected, he'll come back to me..no worries there...not that i am into him no more...

      that was how the wonderful song was typed in a malay tabloid while commenting abt AF2's zarina. hahaha...my immortial..& to think that the song was a wonderful one with such classic vidclip.  the last week had been ok-ok only. had a row with ah-moi friday. her remarks still play in my head abt me not brave enough to say NO to someone and talked abt it only in the back. yeah..sounds very bad of me but my whole intention of not saying NO was because i wanted to help - half heartedly that is. i cant help but bitch abt it but at least i helped solving a problem right? but i cant help think abt it till now..  gotta sambung later...

      i, hereby declare WEDneSDAy (4/08/04) as the worst day for anything to happen to in this very critical period of my life . [naturally, the assumption of yet another worst day declared time &amp; again is not out of the possibility]   ypager.exe error in my notebook kept forcing me to manually take out the battery, pull out the power cord and reboot. it happened like 15 times yesterday ALONE!  my email application was generating errors as well, the support guy who came only ended up removing and re-installing the application. when i tried that, it failed on me!  my two lecturers send me very-very shocking reply to my innocent Question.   i 'ter'blurt out to the mix.fm of the department[who also happen to be my group member] abt my web-cam session with a foreign student over YM   my web-mail didnt work, and all the work i need to do i need to extract from my mail. i wasted another one hour just re-booting my notebook.  my coughing was so bad[and still is] my chest hurt like mad! ladee marah me coz i dont know how to buang phlegm from my mouth..  my favorite car wash was closed. had to resort to a bunch of lazy indians at a gas station to wash icey. they didnt do a good job!!!  my group members didnt come back to me for an assignment that we need to submit TODAY! called up and no answer..sob!  am going to be emcee for a department function tmrw. sore throat, batuk..how la ??!?!!

      yeap, that's  d name of my colleague's baby. she gave birth sunday and i went to Gleneagles to visit yesterday lunch time.  monday, specifically yesterday monday, wasnt a good day ..(so cliche of me...)   was informed of a briefing that i was planning not to attend but totally forgot abt it until my colleague told me yesterday on the way to client-office..shit! cannot escape loh...  the briefing was at citibank, i was at jamek area. crap..  the briefing was full of the people working in my industry, both local and international.   the briefing was boring...  my irritating colleague decided to do her act which i hate the most when i am with her..passing constant remarks abt  everything   and  anything  within her eyesight... she should have been born blind that girl!!!!   so, hadda take cab from citibank to gEagles.. had lunch there and rushed back to jamek. arrived sumwhere around 3pm..tired as hell.   thought of doing some work and ladee decided to go back early.."i am so sleepy..need to go back and sleep.." crap!   so many things to do and so little time and space to settle all...
