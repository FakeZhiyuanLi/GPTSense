      Thank you Brittany...You have renewed my luv for my blog.  Yes, I did say that I wasn't going to write anymore, and I still am not sure whether I want to or not, but I'm going to anyway, just because Brittany is so awesome!  I'm actually talking to her right now on MSN...HI BRITTANY!  Uh, Tina, I don't know if you'll ever read this, but, if you do, I'm sorry for writing that, I didn't mean to write that, I just couldn't think of a better word at the time because it was really early....I'm sorry.   I don't mean to be immature, I just am, I mean come on, I PLAY WITH LEGO'S!!  You don't get much more immature than me, and I'm sorry for that.  I have to be myself, otherwise...who am I???  And if that means you disliking me for being immature and self-centered, than, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to try and ruin your reputation or anything, I just put the words that came to my mouth, and those happened to be them, because my vocabulary wasn't working at the moment.  Like I said before, this is my little chunk of Happiness, and I'm going to try and write whatever I feel like writing, but..I have found that for me it is harder to NOT care than it is to care....which I must admit, sux sumtimes.....but at other times it can be really nice, like when people share things with me, that's really nice....why can't you people trust me?!?!?!?!? :-P  ON A LIGHTER NOTE!! I just got home from church and i got a new blet from ShopKo, and it's really kool, it has flames on it, I like it.....and I got a new BIONICLE!!!  God I'm lame, but I sure do enjoy being lame....hm...I can't think right now, maybe i'll have one of my 22 Zebra cakes....maybe that'll help me think, either way.....I'm fresh out of stuff to write....I'll let you go back to your fun, adventure-packed lives....PEACE!

If anyone else has anything to say about me, anything at all, anything they want to tell me about me, pleeze feel free to do so.  Spense  P.S.

      Ya, so, I had to go and get sum Gameboy games from my mom, because she has a Gameboy and I wanted the games to play on my way to Japan on Saturday.  Of course, being the social being that I am, I invited Kyle along, and so we went, and he let me borrow his really awesome CD, THANX KYLE....YOU ROCK!!! ANYWHO!!!  When we got there, the lights were on and the dogs weren't in their kennel, so I naturally thought that they were home....but they weren't.  Kyle and I figured this fact out after like 1/2 an hour of ringing the doorbell and knocking on the door.  I went around to the backside to check to see if the back door was open(which it usually is) and it wasn't.....well...poo.  How am I gonna get myself out of this one....hm..... I go back to the front and get Kyle and we walked around the house for a while, tryin' to figure out SUM way of getting in, then I had the brilliant idea of breaking in, but none of the doors are break-inable...hm.....except for one...the garage door. So we make our way to the back garage door, and I ask Kyle for a card(me of course having hundreds in my wallet, just forgetting about them) so he hands me his Drivers License, which I use to try and get the door open, after a while, we hear a click....so I gave him his card back because we thought I was gonna break it, and at this point I remembered that I have all of MY cards, so I grab one(PacSun gift card, don't kare too much) and start fiddlin' around with that, after quite sum time I was about to give up, until I felt a bump in the door that I hadn't noticed before...so I went after it. VOILA!!! OPEN DOOR!! WE walk into the house, grab a few pops, eat sum snacks, go upstairs to get the games.....and left. It was pretty fun and very eventful. TOMORROW'S MY LAST DAY OF SCHOOL FOR A WHILE!!! w00t!  I know you're all gonna miss me, but don't get too emotional, I'll be back. :-P Peace!  Spense

      Ya, never mind about the quopte above...just forget about that...it's not there....ya I HATE MY BROADCAST COMMUNICATIONS CLASS!!  They seriously piss me off to an extreme I never thought possible.  So, I'm sitting in the broadcast booth with all of them, and they're editing their racist video, and they interviewed both Kyle and Ervin, and they are just sittin' there rippin' on 'em like there's no tomorrow....seriously....I hope they all die horrible painful slow deaths. Japanese was pretty fun, we just reviewed the whole time. Then after lunch I got asked to prom, and I said sure, and I guess I'm going to prom now, YAY!  I haven't decided if this is a good thing or bad thing yet....I'm gonna go with yes....ya...that's right. Hm....what else.....IN TWO DAYS I GO TO JAPAN!!! That's right ladies and germs, in less than 48 hours, I'm going to be on a plane to Japan, and if you don't miss me I will be sad.....sad like a lost puppy, you don't wanna see the sad puppy do you?!?!?!?!?!  That's what I though.....uh........Peace!  Spense

      YAY!!! I have a comment sectiony thingy on my BLOG!!!!  You should all comment, and by you all I mean anyone who reads this.  Thanx Keli for teaching me how!!  I GO TO JAPAN IN THREE DAYS!!!! w00t...is that not awesome or what?!?!?!?!? I ripped my pants more at mutual tonight :-( *boohoo* but I can probably have my dad sew them...YAY!  Uh, I had Kyle and Ervin go to mutual with me...and they both liked it...that was pretty kool.....uh....about the title of this blog. I have given myself freedom by finally ridding myself of Tina, as far as I know.  I'm not going to go after the relationship anymore, if SHE wants to have sum type of relationship, she's gonna have to get it.  As far as I'm conserned(spelling?) she's not worth the trouble....for the following reasons: 1.) I'm growing to be annoyed by her, especially her laugh 2.) She is continually switching her mind on the topic of friendship, and I'm pissed now 3.) She is trying to steal my friends, bitch. 4.) I have spent too much time caring for sumone who doesn't give a shit whether I fall off a cliff or not 5.) There's probably more reasons...but I can't think of any.. YAY!!! GO MEMORY!!! you suck.  Oh well, I will now go back to my less stressful life!! Peace!  Spense

      well folks...I would have to say that THE SHIT HAS HIT THE FAN....and has splattered all over the place......literally.....ALL OVER......sum reports of shit hitting the middle east is scaring Iraqys...... I just found out like 1/2 an hour ago that my friend Kyle it going to prom with Tina as friends.  Which I must admit, did make me angry, for a few reasons that I will not mention at this moment. Then I got a talk about how Tina isn't my property, and I shouldn't be angry at Kyle for this, when I wasn't REALLY angry at him, I was just kinda angry...but...I'm getting over it as we speak. I'm gonna be so happy when I go to Japan, because that is a basically 2 weeks away from all this High School drama, it will just be me and a whole bunch of Japanese students...with an American thrown in here and there. I hate being a teenager.....it's so FRUSTRATING!!! I don't know if it's the raging hormones or sumthin' else...but.....we are definately F***ED UP!!  So....Tina was going to talk to me and try and make everything better just before I went and ignored everyone and that apparently made her sad/mad/depressed...so...now I feel like shit*does that mean I hit the fan??? I dunno*  and so...she doesn't want to talk to me anymore...and I've also been informed that I'm really immature...so..I feel MORE like shit.....Why does she have to hate me so much?!?!?! Am I really that a horrible of a person???  No, if you read this I'm not triyng to make you sound like a horrible person...so don't even go there!  Great, now I'm angry at sumthing....I'm gonna go take a shower.  Peace!  Spense

      Have you ever actually really wanted to kill sumone???? or maybe, mulitiples sumones????  I hate my Broadcast Communications class with a deep burning passion....I wouln't actually kill them...I don't think I have that much hate in me....but.....I do with for a large majority to die horrible painful ways in a car accident perhaps.......God I'm evil....but that's what makes me fun....right?!?!?  I found that less people like me when I'm nice, but then I try to be nice to keep people close to me, but then I'm not fun anymore or sumthing.....MAN THIS LIFE IS MESSED UP!!!  For lack of a better name...I just named this one the letters on my keyboard...man I sure do get bored too easily!! and d recently I've been getting depressed really easily too...that sux....oh well....I just have to try and be positive ALL THE TIME.....that shouldn't be TOO hard right?!?!?!?!

GO ME!!! You know what the temp is there?!?!?! 60 degrees!!  That's 40 degrees more than here here, losers!!! *Evil Laugh* MUHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  I feel good, but I'm pretty sure I'm gonna forget sumthing.....poo on you memory..... Ya, I was really hyper today, but then second block fixed that, I don't know why though....oh ya...maybe it's the fact that my group didn't let me DO ANYTHING!!! damn them........and during first block I fell asleep and was snoring kinda, so I got poked, and people were reading their favorite childrens stories...I felt bad because it was like I didn't kare...but it was just so DAMN peaceful!!! What else happened today....uh.....a rabid black man broke into my house and was typing things on my computer...but I drove him...he didn't speak an ounce of English and it was quite scary..but I showed him who was boss!!  w00t!  Uh...other than that, today was pretty uneventful....hm.....nope..can't think of anything.....besides the fact that I luv DDR more every day.....Peace!  Spense

      You're probably either wondering what the hell I'm talking about, or saying I'm a dipshit.  I'll explain: I just figured out that I am destined to be a clown or sumthing because a few simple things 1.) I always feel a duty to cheer people up 2.) I LOVE to make people laugh 3.) You either think I'm funnier that hell....or you hate me as you can see, all of there are clown traits.  But, now that I think about it, I just feel a sense of duty.  period.  end of sentence. For instance: I was just walking up to the bathroom a bit ago, and I felt the need to take a shower, and I know a bunch of people who would've just gone and takin' a shower, but I didn't, because of the mere fact that I'm talking to Conrad online, and I feel it is my duty to keep talking to him as long he wants me to, I'm not just gonna say I'll be right back, then go take a shower and return half an hour later just to see that he is no longer online...when I say I'll be right back, I mean it.  Do I bend over to other peoples will too easily?!?!?!  I don't know....I'll have to think about this when I actually do take a shower.  Or are sum people way too easily sidetracked....I dunno anymore, I can't think straight right now....which is probably why I never wrote my sonet for Creative Writing..I LUV poetry, yet I didn't write one...what is up with me?!?!?!  Man, last night I went and saw Hidalgo with my dad, and I've gotta tell you....THAT MOVIE ROXORZ ALL THE BASE THAT ARE BELONG TO US!!!!  Seriously....it rocked.  Then when we got home I went to tre's LAN for a little bit....with a few amusing incidents along the way.   1st incident- I put the car into first gear and took my foot off the clutch while the car wasn't moving, if you drive a manual, you know this is a no-no....it kills the car instantly, leaving the driver quite confused and looking stupid.  Just as this happened my dad looked back just to see me drive away, instead he saw me with a dead car.  2nd incident- I sat there for like 30 seconds just putting on my seatbelt, meanwhile my dad just kept staring at me, and then when I finally got on my seat belt, I turned on the car and didn't give it enough gas and killed it again..in the exact same spot....well...now I feel like a total dipshit 3rd incident- I finally got off to the LAN and arrived with no more problems.  Then when I get there I saw what I could've sworn was two people being rather intamite upstairs...and to my surprise..they kind've were....and then I rang the doorbell and ruined the whole moment.  They came and opened the door and I took off my shoes and went downstairs. That's the end of the incidents...but...I only stayed at the LAN for like 15 minutes....just long enough to recieve an attempted tickling for Kyle, get raped by Ervin, and use my 1337 ninja skillz to sneak into the bathroom area and sneak back out without waking any sleeping Eklunds.  I then glided back downstairs and waited to play DDR for like 10 minutes, but Ervin and Brittany are selfish whores*I'm just kidding* then I ended up leaving and returning to my home, where I slept peacefully...and had no dreams that I can remember....and so is my life....which is calling me....gotta answer!  Peace!  Spense

      You people should really come online and give me a purpose in life, seriously, I'm bored as hell.....and I would know, hell is boring.  I just got home from my Japanese meeting an hour ago, where I learned when I'm leaving and who my host family is and all that good stuff.  My host family seems nice, and they don't smoke, and they have 2 kids, a 16 year-old daughter and a 13 year-old son.  So, that could be pretty kool.....as soon as Ashley*my friend* read the people in my host family she was like, OOOO, a 16 year-old girl ;-)  Ya right, if i can't get any american chicks, what makes her think that sumone from a totally different country would show any interest.  Also a notable note, I'm the ONLY guy going on the trip, I'm the only male, all the rest are of the female species....I haven't decided if this is good or bad.  Last night was fun though, I got home from my mom's house about 9:00ish, and I got online*of course* and instantly I was told to go to the Song Garden, so I asked my dad if I could, and I could, so I went.  When I got there, only Ervin was there, and then Brittany showed up very close*time wise* behind me, and then Kyle showed up like 5 minutes later, how was he so slow?!?!?!?!?  So we sat and ate sum food, and by we I mean Kyle, Ervin, and me*Brittany didn't eat any, how come girls never want to eat around us....especially at the Song Garden?!?!?!?!*  I didn't finish all of mine because it was pretty spicy, so I got it put into tiny boxes and brought it home and my dad ate it for lunch today.  Either way, after we wre done eating there, we decided we didn't want to go home yet, so we drove over to Conor's and played ding-dong-ditch on him....except his doorbell didn't work...so we just hit it instead, and then we were walking and this SUV drove past us like 8 times just yelling things at us, then they drove past one last time, and Brittany and Ervin ran to the side of the road*pansies* and me and Kyle just stood there, oops, Kyle and I just stood there, and they just drove past, but then they jsut drove past and didn't do anything, then like 50 feet away they threw a cone out the window....so I went and picked it up.  Then another car came past and i threw the cone to the side so that they wouldn't see it.  Then I remembered that I had to piss really really bad, so I went and pissed off in the trees, meanwhile Kyle, Ervin, and Brittany just walked away.  Then when I was done, I went and grabbed the cone, and walked over to Kyle, Ervin, and Brittany, who were contemplating ding-dong-ditching Mr. Rohl.  I just took my cone and started walking back to Brittany's car, and this guy came out from this near-by house without a shirt, and when he got close to us he yelled "Oh Shit!" and ran away back to his house, and halfway there his phone fell of his buckle, and I yelled "You dropped your phone!"  Then I continued to walk, and I was soon joined by Brittany and Kyle.  A while later Ervin came running after us and he had ding-dong-ditched Mr. Rohl, and it was all good.....then we got into the car, and were dropped off at our cars, and we drove home, and I slept....and then i woke up and went to my meeting, leaving me here, writing this......well....I've taken up enough of the internet, I'll go....PEACE-OUT!

      So, Tina apparently thinks that me not talking to my friends was just a plee for attention.....bitch.  Seriously, she ALWAYS seems to find the downside to everything I do.  I try to forget her because she seems to be doing absolutely nuthing towards rebuilding a relationship of any kind, and suddenly she thinks I'm doing it just to get attention. Look, I'm sorry that you don't want to be my friend, I've heard that I can be a pretty awesome person when you get to know me...but......WTF?!?!?!?!  Seriously though, what the hell is going on?  She hates me, and she doesn't hate me...then she hates me MORE, then she doesn't hate me, then she hates me again.....my my god god. Either way, today was pretty kool, besides the fact that I think my Japanese teacher STILL hates my guts.  We got to sing with the St. Thomas choir*we being anyone who knows Loch Lomand* and this afternoon I'm at my moms to play board games and DDR with them, but then tonight they're bringing me home because I have a Japanese meeting tomorrow.  I'm gonna go back to my highly uplifting life....Peace.  Spense

      Talk about feeling unwanted.  I'll talk about this later though.  I tried talking to my friends again today and being all happy, and it seemed that no one really kared....that sucked. BUT, what hurt MOST of all was when I fickin' broke my hand on Ervin, I tried to karate chop him during focus...and I actually think I broke my hand....boy does THAT suck. Then after focus, everyone was talkin' about how they were goin' to prom and it was all good, and I'm not.  So, that was mildly depressing, and I know I never intended on going, but...for like two weeks I did plan on going, but that fell through when Tina dumped me, so.....now I once again never intend on going.  It's still kinda sad though. Then I watched the koolest movie ever in Japanese kalled Water Boys...it was seriously HILARIOUS!!!  I absolutely loved it....even though I didn't understand most of it! Then in forth block I GOT TO SING JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR DREAMCOAT!!! Man that's awesome, I like that musical a butt-load....it was kool. Then I thought I was just gonna ride the bus home like every other day....and go to my house and be content just like every other day, oh....but THAT went down the shitter WAY fast..... As I went to get on the bus, I saw Ervin, who said he was going to my house, so..I was wondering what he was doin', seeing as he was sitting around talking to other people in the commons...and I was like "Ervin, are you goin' to my house or not?" and then he said sumthin' along the lines of, I'll get a ride later, and so I asked him who he was gettin' a ride from, and he said probably Brittany, so I said I would just get a ride too then.  So we went looking for Brittany, and we couldn't find her anywhere, so I said I would kill Ervin if he got us stuck at the High School, then we went downstairs a while later, and we found Brittany, and she was just talkin' to sum friends, so, we told her we were getting a ride to my house from her, and she said o.k.  But, I later found out that she was giving 3 other people rides home, too!  So.....it was gonna be rather crowded...and one of the people was Tina.  Whom still hasn't talked to me or tried to "make things better."  So, I knew that it was going to be rather awkward in that car.....luckily she got to sit in the front seat, and I got to sit in the back with Gloria, Ervin, and Tascha.....one of which has a boyfriend(Gloria) and the other two are going to prom together....so...once again...I feel rather out of place back there.....but I would have rather been back there then up front...where there was Tina and Brittany.  Ya, so...the entire I felt rather awkward....which is why I'm still pretty angry that I took that ride home instead of just riding the bus.    Also, before we left, Tascha was chasing me, and I was running fast, and I thrust my shoulder into a door trying to get it to open fast, but instead...I ended up shattering the glass.....so...I felt like a pretty big dumbass.  Either way, today made me feel rather unwanted....including Tina saying that she WAS gonna talk to me even though no one else was, and then she never did...so....ya......I'm scum.

      Well, even though I did not talk to basically any of my friends today, it actually was an O.K. day....it halped me figure out that not that many people talk to me anyway..so...it wasn't actually that lonely or anything, and I got to talk to new people...which was also kool.....O.K....I understand that my choosing to not talk to anyone may have been a little uh.....rash?? but....Hey, if she can decide to throw me out of her life....I'm being prepared to throw her out of mine....so....as soon as she can figure out whether she hates me or not is when I can start talking to my friends again.....so....sorry people.....not my fault!  Hm.....what happened today....Focus was an entire waste, I just sat in the broadcast communications room staring at the wall basically...because the group using the computer ahead of us was a fuckin' slow ass bitch!!  and he should be dragged into the street and shot :-D  That would make me happy...and a lot of other people happy too....because it was Jim Linehan.....stupid fucker.  I bet my friends were in Mrs. Loney's focus talking to Tina the whole time again......god she is pissin' me off.....I swear to god she is slowly stealing my friends.....and me not talking to any of them at the moment doesn't really help that much...but......that's another reason I did this whole thing, as a test almost.....to see if they would still be on "my side" after I don't talk to them.....and if they aren't......oh well....then they weren't good freinds in the first place...and I shouldn't have been friends with them....but if they are, then they are doing exactly what they should do......am I sick for playing tests with peoples heads??  Or am I just WAY TOO PARANOID!!!!! I still think she's stealing my friends....if she were to decide whether she hated me or not...this whole process would go smoother....because than I could hate her and not feel bad, even though at the moment I don't feel bad......GIRLS ARE SO.....no....not all girls....TINA IS SO CONFUSING!!! How hard is it to make up your mind?!?!?!?!?! Seriously.....and as for my friends....wtf are you thinking?!?!?!?  Sure, you have your free will and all, but......REALLY.....DOES LOYALTY MATTER TO ANYONE ANYMORE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!  God.....I sat down writing this and I was totally calm...and now I'm a frickin' ragin' psycopath.......I'm gonna go listen to music.....  Spense  P.S. Yes, Brittany, I still read your blog, and you haven't totally lost a friend...just....I can't talk to any of you right now...because I'm getting ready to*or trying to right now* get rid of my memories of Tina....which are quite a few....because she is *as far as I know* just booting me out of her life....and so.....I'm trying to return the favor...even though it won't matter to her.....but......if I can associate anyone to a memory of Tina, I can't be around them for a while.....because it brings back that memory...and then I get sad.....because MOST of the memories were good....mmmm.....back seat......who?!?! what?!?!? oh....nuthing..I wasn't saying anything......but...I should probably go now..before more memories arise.....Peace Out!  Spense  ME AGAIN!!  O.K. So I just read Brittany's blog...and it talks about how Tina is "trying to make things better between us".....frankly......I believe this could possibly be what I would like to call.....BULLSHIRT!!!  She has never even talked to me...or contacted me in anyway..so...how exactly she is "trying to make things better"...I have no klue....even though that DOES make me feel a little better...and I think I might be ready to talk to you guys earlier than expected...which I think most of you need....considering two of you were farely sad about me being all :-X-like....oh well...I'm gonna go back to......doing.....sumthing.......which I haven't decided what it is yet......Peace!

      Man....talk about a depressing day.... I woke up and felt fine, ready to take on the world, I can do anything!! YAY!!! 1st block...I don't have my homework done...no one really notices or cares, encluding the teacher, which was O.K. FOCUS: I try to do as much manual labor as possible just to try and keep myself busy, because when I'm not busy, I'm thinking, and when I'm thinking, I get depressed...and I was trying to avoid Tina.  I go back into Mrs. Loney's room after doing as much work as possible, until it was done, and all of my friends are sitting outside the classroom talking to guess who...TINA!!!  They're sitting outside just chatting it up with her, having a gay old time, meanwhile I sit in the room ripping up old Japanese homework because I'm so fucking pissed at them.....Is it so bad to ask for a little loyalty???? seriously!! 2nd block: I got to Broadcast Communications and wrote another poem, which sounded a lot like a suicide note, I seriously talk about how everything pisses me off, and I feel like shit, and I just want to die, or go into a never-ending sleep.  Then I went to McDonalds and got sum Apple Pies because it wasn't time for Lunch yet, they were still serving breakfast and I couldn't get a damn Big Mac yet....stupid McD's....then on the way back, I smelt sumthing that smelled like a skunk, and I ask the driver and the passenger what the smell was, and they were sittin' there smokin' pot...ON THE WAY TO SKOOL!!! With me in the backseat, trying not to breath in any fumes or nuthin' 3rd Block: I was gonna express to sumone how much I hate things at the moment, then we got new seats... poo on you new seats.  So we sat in Japanese and talked about what we're gonna be doing for our reward day on Thursday, and everyone wanted to watch anime, when I just wanted to play Battleball, mainly because I just wanted to hit sumthin'....then we decided what toppings we wanted on our pizza for the anime, and nobody wanted sausage except me....talk about a downer...but then my awesome tomodachi*friend* told me that she would make 1/4 of the pizza sausage just for me :-) That made me happy, but that smile looks wicked to me for sum reason....it's kreepin' me out. 4thA Block: I paced around the Choir room for a while, until the bell rung, then I sat down and she told us how we had to write our Concert Reflection and I didn't, instead I wrote ANOTHER depressing poem, which was worse than the last one....and no one seemed to notice, until Cobian asked me what was wrong, and i said nuthing. 4thB Block: I sat there and wrote my actual Concert Reflection essay, and Erivn asked me what was wrong towards the end of class, and I basically told him to fuck off....I feel bad. Then I got on the bus and this weird kid who i don't know commented on how many sharpies I have...meanwhile I just sat in thought and listened to my CD player...if it weren't for my CD player I would go insane...seriosuly Then I got home, and that's where it all goes downhill fast, I got home and decided to tell all my friends to not talk to me or have any contact with me, mainly because of Tina, and how I am really starting to hate her pressence, even though I feel if she were to ask for forgiveness or sumthin'..I would give it to her in the wink of an eye....which makes me MORE pissed...mainly at myself....for being such a dumbshit, JUST GIVE UP MAN...SHE'S NOT COMING BACK!!!! GET OVER IT!!!!!  Man I'm a sad, pathetic loser. Then after I told all my friends to go to hell, I decided to study, because that keeps me from freely thinking, and so I sat and studied Japanese for a while...which I still don't quite don't understand...then I decided I didn't like studying, so I layed down and decided I wanted to sleep, so I did....restlessly.  I kept waking up like every half hour, and with my contacts in...so now my eyes look like shit....and when my dad got home he woke me up unintentionally, and we discovered that the heat was out in out house....YAY!! SO I'm freezing now too!! I still have to take a shower too, and it has to be hella-short, because we only have a little bit of hot water in our pipes...and the rext will be freezing cold.  So, I'm pretty pissed right about now, and I just read bash.org for like 2 hours....god that is uber-funny..... Skool is going to suck for the next little while, and I'm going to get very depressed and very sad, most likely crying a lot...and I don't wanna...but I have to, because if I don't....I'll never get over Tina, and that will just leave to MORE sadness....so.....I'm trying to beat pain with pain I guess, which sux hardcore.  Oh well, like anyone actually gives a damn about my senseless whining, not to mention that like two people read this ever.....if that....Peace!  Spense

      Wow...I don't know what is wrong with me today...but..I feel like writing.....even though I have nuthing to write about that I know of. Hmmmm......today I went down to Ervin's to get my PS2 back, and I hung around there for a while...then he got a call from McDonalds....he had to work today....*and we were in the middle of 5th Element too*  So he got dressed really fast...and then I drove him to McD's and then I went to EconoFoods to get the root beer like my dad told me to..and I saw Naomi there...that was pretty kool.  *hehehe..her name backwards is Imoan......gehehehehehe*  So, I went and got the root beer and got to about the hospital when i realized, I left my PS2 at Ervin's....WOW...I'm stupid....so..I did a quick U-ey in the road and headed back for Ervin's. When i got there his mom had left the door unlocked, because she noticed that I left it there, and knew I would be coming back for it.  So when I did, she kinda laughed at me, and then told me to lock the door when I left, and I did.  I then left and drove back to my house, and played a little bit of DDR, I did the lessons, seeing if by doing them all I could get another song or sumthin', but it got really boring, so I quit.  Then I sat down and typed on the computer for while...waiting for people to come on...so I can talk to them....and when people did finally come on..I had to go eat dinner.....boy it was good.  Coloflower*can't spell*and cheese, with chicken.....yum...it was good....I can still taste the cheese and Coloflower*partially because it's probably still stuck in my braces*  Dang you braces....oh well.....I get them off soon...YAY!!  My next appointment is on the 4th of April or sumthin'....YAY!  I don't get them off then though.....poo.... I GO TO JAPAN IN LESS THAN 2 WEEKS!!  I hope you all miss me when I'm gone...or I'll be uber pissed..and if you want me to get yo anything...tell me....or....nuthing for you!  :-P hm...what else is there to talk about???? hm......I feel there is sumthing else I need to say...but I don't know what it is....... Well..I've been writing for basically a half hour now...and...I've kinda run out of stuff to say...even though I know there is sumthing I'm forgetting...what could it be.....I DON'T KNOW!!!  Well.....I figured out one thing after sitting here looking at the monitor for like 15 minutes....I STILL MISS TINA!!!  I don't kare how much people tell me to get over her...or how much I tell myself that I am over her.....I'm just lying to myself....I really miss her...even if she does hate me...or....if she's actually reading this......put "you" in for "her" and "she"...and change "does" to "do" Man I'm pathetic...why is it so hard to get over Tina?!?!?!?!  Sumone give me an answer or a hammer or sumthin'....PLEEZE!!!  Well...I don't know what the other thing was stil.....but..I'm gonna go back to my still empty life.....Peace  Spense  ***EDIT***  I had to edit it....because the time was horribly wrong...it's actually 8:30ish when I wrote this...not the time that it said before...which was like 5:30ish...stupid wrong timey thingy..  Either way...back on to the topic I was just talking about before I go to bed...I don't like being called awesome.....pleeze...no one call me awesome.....this period of time has caused me to understand that awesome can turn into utter hatred really fast...Why did it have to change so fast?  How do feelings flip back and forth that fast?!?!?  confusing.....I THINK SO!!!  I don't think that you can really hate sumone until you get to know them fully...and I don't think that I was given enough time to fully express myself...no I'm not trying to bash anyone....I'm just saying sumthin' that I feel...and if anyone takes this to heart and changes their outlook on sumone...THEN I WILL HUNT THE DOWN AND KILL THEM!!!! K?!?!?  good.  Peace Again  Spense

      DANGIT!!!  I forgot to write in my blog YET AGAIN!!!  I'm a terrible person, sumone kill me....:-( Hm.....what's new...... The DDR/LAN party was actually a lot kooler than I thought it might be.....even though I had to leave at midnight....poo.  Darn my father and his not-trustingness....the only reason I had to leave was because I doesn't like the thought of me sleeping where girls are also, even though of the three children he has, I'm probably the one he DOESN'T have to worry about.....1.) Considering my brother had a kid at 19 and my sister went out with Donald Spencer....I mean....COME ON!!! 2.) There were no girls there who would've come within 5 feet of me anyway....and basically there was one girl who was even noticing that I was alive, and that was tre, because she was using me as a pillow....other than that....I was totally girl-free....pshhh...and my dad doesn't trust me....I probably wouldn't have slept anyway...just played DDR and stuff.  I think that Tina is trying to make me kill myself.....I dunno if she does it on purpose..or if it's just a terrible coincidence for me...but...it seems every time that we're both at sum type of social events...she always wears her hottest clothes....almost to taunt me.....most liekly on a total fluke though......because...if she actually did that....that would mean she actually paid attention to me....but....I know that she doesn't..so.....I'M INSANE!!!!! My life is very blah right now......so....I'm gonna go back...and sit and stare at my computer monitor....and go......"blah"...because I seem to be good at that....Peace!  Spense

      Hey, I'm writing in this now, because I ahven't really written in it today....even though I did.  I'm spending the night at Steve's....and it's fun. I really don't have anything to talk about, besides the fact that Steve and Ervin spent most of the day at my house..and it was kool. I'm kinda worried about the party, tomorrow....and i know why.... because lately there has been sum contention between sum people*not saying who* and it firghtens me that the party could take on a negative nature because of this...I know it's not my party, and I really shouldn't kare, but I am anyway.....oh well.....see most of you tomorrow...or today....depending on when you look at this...

      DAMN YOU JAPANESE!!!! You have foiled my fun AGAIN!!!!  I didn't get to write in my blog yesterday because of my stupid Japanese homework...so...this is gonna count as yesterdays blog.....because I will most likely write 2 today.....either way It's 6:25 A.M. and I've already been awake for 2 hours....ha ha ha....sux to be you sleeper-inners...I hate you guys. Well, uh.....I've been listening to Get Low for basically a week straight, except when I'm at skool, and I've come to realize, this song rox....but is kinda sick.....but that doesn't take away from its awesomeness.  I added another two people to my MSN list, Steph and Sam...so that brings the grand total to......35!  Wow, I didn't know that that many people knew me....apparently they do.....w00t! Man, this DDR/LAN tomorrow could be very interesting.....including spilled blood..which would suck.....because as far as I know, a few of the people going are having sum quarells, I believe I'm in one of them, but...I'm not a participant...I am just disliked....but..I don't kare, I'm going anyway, and I'm gonna have fun, and there's a few things you could do about it...but I hope you don't. I think I've run out of things to say for the moment...besides the fact that it's A SNOW DAY!!!!!! Peace  Spense

      ALRIGHT!!! It's past my bedtime, but since I promised myself that I would write in this everyday, i'm going to write in it EVERYDAY DANGIT!!!  Hm...today was interesting, I started out by going to our choir thingy and singing first block, which was fun, but then I got uber pissed at sum stupid Sophomores for being morons*they shall not be named, because if you don't know who they are, you don't need to know*  Then I went to class for like 5 minutes....and then went to Mrs. Loneys for focus, and ended up being told to help her control student traffic for the choir thingy...and that she was gonna get us out of our classes all day*me and a few other people* and I was just fine with that, unfortunately, one of my teachers wasn't...that's where the trouble starts.  K, so I'm getting a D in Japanese*big frickin' deal* and so I'm not allowed to stay out of skool all day to help Mrs. Loney, instead, I have to go to Japanese and learn a bunch of worthless CRAP!!  So that made me angry, but before that I got to get hiy by a truck during second block, that was LOADS of fun...... Then the Chamber Choir sang, and we kicked major butt!  Then my dad took me and Ervin home, and I got to take the car and go to Ervin's, where I stayed for a while, and then Ervin took me and I got to go get a new Bionicle*which made me happy* but before that, what made me even MORE happy, was that I talked to Tina for quite sum time...and it was really kool to me.....MAN I LIKE DRIVING!! Then after that we went back to my house*me and Ervin* and ate dinner than went to Mutual, where we went to a jail, and it was really scary...the people were creepy there.  Then I got to hang out with sum hot chicks *apparently one of whose friends thinks I'm hot...which is pretty kool*  Then I drove Ervin home and I am here now talking to you people....this would have been longer and even MORE detailed....but I really gotta get my beauty sleep....PEACE!!!

      OH CRAP!!! I almost forgot about my blog today!!  I'm so ashamed...I was sittin' in the shower washing my hair, and I thought about my blog!! I hadn't written in it today! So I decided to write in it now, a few minutes before I go to bed.  That's how important you people are to me, I care about your boredom, if it weren't for my blog, what would you do all day?!?!?!?!?!  Nuthing, you'd probably go insane and kill yourselves, and then I would be sad :-(    So.....What is there to talk about today....hm.....I'm not quite sure....hm......today was SEVERELY BLAH!!!!  Well, I spent all of 2nd block getting beat up and beating people up, and getting thrown into lockers....either way...it was ALL GOOD!  1st block I listened to peoples short stories, a few which involved murderers..and they were kreepily real.....I think people were bored by short story, it was about a blood elf named Kerrigor, if you want to read it just tell me...it was kool.(At least I think so)  Either way, after that, we were told to write about sumthing that makes us go "hm...", and guess what I wrote about....YOU ARE CORRECT, TINA!!!  Hm.....then what happened....lunch for sum reason hurt my mouth, quite a bit.  What else happened, TOMORROW IS THE CHOIR BIG....GROupy....thingy...it's gonna be kool, and i'm gonna dress all snazzy, it'll be kool.  Then Ervin and Steve came over after Steve, and there was no power at my house, so we played Clue, and I owned them, then I went to the bathroom, and while I was in there, the electricity came back on!!! Ah, the miracles of the toilet....:-P  Then I took Ervin to Pep band, and I finished my Japanese homework, and listened to a lot of my music....it was all good.....until of course I noticed that Tina was there, and then it all started to get depressing, but I honked at them on the way out because Tashca wouldn't get out of my car's way....poo on Tascha!!!  Then we(me and Ervin) were driving right behind Rachel and she ran a stop sign, so we followed her home and yelled at her.....poo on Rachel....POO ON EVERYBODY!!! Except for you kool people reading this....you people are kool...either way...I think I have run out of stuff to say......so...I'm gonna go back to my horribly boring depressing life.....PEACE!!

Alright, now that I've had my little spaz for the day, I can go on with the rest of my blog.  Alright, so...I'm a little scared because I'm a starting to like rap....seriously...I'm not a rap person, but for sum reason I've started listening to it and liking it.....WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME!!!!  Well, I learned yesterday that Tina's going to try and and work on the whole hating me thing, which is rather kool, but really, that email left me more confused than it helped me.  How I went from rap to Tina I have no klue. Bye Kitty!  Sorry, my cat just jumped off the computer table, and i had to type good0bye to it.  Wow, see, I AM lame....it's fun though...I really have no clue what to talk about today...today was kinda....BLAH!!  I learned who my last teammate was in the ML game, and the person was right under my nose the whole time, it was rather dissappointing.

      God damning fuckin' shit fuck bitch, fuck damn fuck shit damn.... **We're experiencing technical difficulties.....please stand by** I hate Japan, with a passion.  If it weren't for that fuckin' fortune, none of this woulda happened. I will explain now. In Japan, I went to a shrine thingy and got a bad luck fortune that said that following: Your body is one but with two different kind mind, so everything goes out of order.  Just like lunar eclipse make all dark, al will be at dark.  Though fortune approaches to you, but you can't get it. Just like a fish can't meet water, there may be so many possibility to be a bad case for you.  As I have found...this has all come true.  I royally fucked myself over.  I basically told the only girl to actually love me that I couldn't go out with her ecause I was interested in someone else....UNFORTUNATELY, the other girl doesn't like me in anyway what-so-ever.  So, I think that I might just go die sumwhere, because I felt like a big piece of shit, and then the first girl*Keli* is avoiding me, and I feel really bad, and I'm pretty sure that she has already forgotten about me, and wants nuthin' to do with me because I'm such an ass.  I never said that I didn't have feelings for Keli, just...I still had feelings for Tina, and my mind went one way, but I wanted to go a different.... unfotunately my mind won.  I now feel very stupid and want to jump off a cliff, but....that's ok.  I'm sure that sumday I will find sumone who likes me and I won't screw them over, or be screwed over by other people.  I now have to go to work..... I'm sorry to everyone who has had to listen to my BS.....but I'm mostly sorry to Keli.  I wish that you would forgive me, then again..I hope you don't, just so that I can't hurt you again or sumthin'....god I'm a fucktard. Peace!  Spense

I never thought I could hurt sumone so bad....but apparently I can...I didn't really want to...and I STILL don't want to, but for the moment..I really need to figure things out. so.....I still have feelings for Tina, but Keli is a very special person to me also.....unfotunately....I hurt Keli really bad...and I don't think that Tina will ever come back...so....I think I pretty much F***ed myself over..... damn I wish I wasn't such a retard.....

      Brittany told me to update.......so I do. My life has suddenly become a living hell of thoughts and self-mutilation. So....I talked to Tina for like two hours after school today....and I figured sum things out. 1.)Why I couldn't ask Keli out. 2.)I still like Tina. Too bad, the two are intertwined..... Tina said sumthin' along the lines of how she has thought about starting a relationship.......but it's not worth it or sumthin'.....this makes me kinda sad...but also kinda happy.  If I can convince her that it would be worth it to go out with me....I might be able to pull off happiness.  Too bad this might be very hard..... This also leaves behind the question of....what about Keli. Don't get me wrong....I like Keli a lot......a bunch in fact....but....it's not the same kind of feelings that I feel for Tina though.....and this makes me sad...because I don't want to be mean to Keli...but...I know that if I were to go out with her...my feelings for Tina would get in the way....THUS...making it a very wierd relationship.  I feel like shit.  I want Tina....but...I don't want to hurt Keli......but....I.....KJLSAJBNKOU!!! I've got to find a way out of this....I always do....I'm the planner....this is what I do.....I shoudl be able to do this....just....it'll take me a while. Peace Out!  Spense

      I want my internet back gosh darnit.....seriously....this whole comin' down to Ervin's to check it is bullshit....I want my own internet back.  I also want my life to be less confusing....confused???  I will explain. Tina sent me an email that said she didn't hate me, and in fact was kinda sad that I hated her..when I really don't....and she was convinced that I was trying to get Jackieto hate her in Japan..when I wasn't doing that either.  Me and Jackie were simply reminiscing....not very NICE memories...but memories none-the-less.  I have been emailing Keli for a while now, and boy do I miss her.  I just wish she would come back...then life would be less of a hell.....I spent most of today arguing with myself over Tina or Keli...which is dumb...because Tina doesn't like me and I know it...well, she doesn't like me in THAT way anymore....if she ever did, which Japan made me doubt.  Either way, as soon as Keli gets back from Japan...after giving her the biggest hug ever, I'm gonna ask her out..and I will be happy....UBER happy...the happiest I've been since January 5th...or so.  God do I look forward to that day...now i must go home and work on Japanese homework...stupid japanese teached hating me....*grumble**grumble**grumble*  and I need a shower...after working at McD's and burning my hands and such......

      Seriously....whenver I go there I seem to get answers to my questions...maybe it's a sign.  hm...... **NOTE**Go to church more. Like, today I received an answer that I had been trying to find out, and you know what that answer is.....FORGIVENESS!!!  I must forgive people, which I try to do, but when I do..they seem to not like me :-S...hm...oh well, it's not my fault.  WHY DOES KELI HAVE TO BE GONE SO LONG!?!?!?!?!?!  I'm have withdrawals man...Oh well, as long I keep having little social issues, maybe those can keep my mind busy, so I don't think about friends who are gone.   This weeks social issue seems to start with a "K" and end with "yle".  So, I invited him over for my "Birthday Party," and we were outside by my trampoline, deciding what to do, and I said sumthin'*I don't remember what* but...he took it in the wrong way like he always does.  Then we decided to go to his house and get his LAN equipment so that we could MULTI-BOX HALO!!!  But on the way there we got into an "argument" about whether Jim Carrey was in the second Dumb and Dumber, and I knew that he wasn't.  Finally Kyle gave in, and I said O.K....and then he got really quiet.  Then right before we got to his house he said "You know, I'm not having a very good time, seeing as we're going to MY house to get my stuff."  WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY TO THAT?!?!?!?!?!?  Nuthing.  So I didn't.  Then we went back to my house, and we sat down and watched Boondock Saints and ate Pizza...but Kyle refused to sit down, and he didn't eat either.  It was obvious he was gonna be a little bitch, so I stodd up and told him that he was having such a crappy time, he could call his dad, and I handed him the phone.  So he called his mom, then went and sat outside until his parents showed up to pick him up...and then he told everyone else that showed up*Conor, JD, and Glenny* that WE were mean to him, and that we were "ungrateful"...FOR WHAT?!?!?!?!  Then he didn't come to Brittany L's.*not gonna try and spell her name...too hard* birthday party because me and Ervin were there, and he told her that we were "mean to him"....I don't know why I put up with him...I just know that this time, I'm not gonna fuckin' apologize, HE can apologize to me.....oh well, I'm beating my family at DDR and that ALWAYS makes me happy. Peace!  Spense  P.S. My internet is down for a day or two....so...don't expect me to respond too fast to anything....uh...bye!

Ya, I really have no interesting stories to tell today, it was pretty uneventful, except the fact that I NOW HAVE A JOB AT MCDONALDS!!!!  but that's about it....other than that, my life is pretty uneventful. I did notice one thing though....WHY DO YOU PEOPLE TALK ABOUT TINA SO MUCH?!?!?!?!  seriously, if you talk about her to others as much as you do talking to me, you guys have sum serious issues...I really don't kare to hear or talk about her frankly, so, just treat it like a normal subject.  That is all. Peace, and for Keli, love.*not that I don't love you people...it's just that I love her more :-D  Spense

      GOD last night rocked...it was seriously awesome.  Yesterday was o.k.....but last night ROCKED!  First, I sepnt the night at Kyle's, then we biked to his dads work* to ask if we can go to the MOA . *He works at the University, it wasn't that far Then when we got home I was freakin' out because I remembered that I had an orthodontist appointment to go to, so I was trying to figure out how to fit everything into one day. 2.)Wrote in my blog 3.)Went to the MOA...it was pretty kool, got to laugh a lot and hang out with my best buds  BEST QUOTE IN THE WORLD at the moment: "Merry Christmas, your skin is gone." 4.)Skipped my ortho appointment because there wasn't enough time for it and MOA and stuff. 5.)Got home and stayed around for like 10 minutes(in which I called Lauren and found out I was supposed to go to her house.) 6.) Went to Laurens house and stayed for like 25 minutes, then had to go back home so that my dad could ahve the car....but he drove me down to Lauren's...so it was all good. When I got there the second time, everyone was inside, and I just followed John inside and to the basement and stuff...it was kool. Sat down and watched One Tree Hill, got to watch sum Cheerleaders...which reminded me of the conversation I had with Brittany(read it here: http://www.livejournal.com/users/cosmicastaway_/ ) Then we watched 2Fast 2Furious...it was pretty good, but I must admit that I didn't pay much attention to the second half.  I was too busy being by Keli...god that rocked. Seriously, I never thought that holding hands could be that kool...BUT IT WAS!!! I really like her, and she really likes me, and I'm gonna miss her really bad when she's in Japan, but the fact that she is gonna be having the time of her life makes it a little better.  Hopefully she'll remember me and won't go and find sum really awesome Japanese guy who is a billion times kooler than I am.(which isn't that hard) Then everyone left and I got a ride home with Keli, and we held hands the whole way back, and that was kool too...I never thought about showing any signs of affection in front of grown-ups...but we held hands the whole way.....it was nice.  Then when I got out of the car, I got a big hug from Keli, and that was UBER nice...I like hugs from Keli....they're so....I dunno...they are just really awesome.  Then I went inside and got to try and go on the internet...but my dad has F***ED up the computer too bad for it to work sumtimes.....it really sux.  ***TODAY*** I called Kyle and Steve while I was in the bathtub...that was funny :-P  I was too lazy to get out.  Then they came over, and I was still in the bath when Steve got there, so he just drove around his go-kart for a while, and I got to ride with him when I went outside.  Then Steve, Kyle, Ervin, Conor, Glennie, and I sat down and watched the Linkin Park DVD that Ervin got yesterday, it was rock-awesome.  Then Ervin had to leave for work, and Kyle took him home and never came back, because apparently he didn't wanna watch Matrix Revolutions that bad.  So Steve, Conor, Glennie, and I watched Matrix together...and man that movie rox!  Then I took them home, and on the way back I drove like a maniac and almost flipped my car, and Steve and I almost died...that was fun.  It was scary as hell, and then when I opened the door to the house, my dad opened the door and hopped out and yelled...so I think I pissed my pants.  Then I ate dinner and packed up my stuff to spend the night at Steve's...which leaves me here. HOLY CRAP THAT WAS A LOT OF TYPING!!!  Alright, I think I'm done for now.  Keli, if you read this, I still love you, and already miss you hardcore. Peace!  Spense

      Keli is leaving for Japan tomorrow, and that sux....alot.  I hope she has fun though, but MAN am I gonna miss her.  She is so great, I really like her.  I wish I wasn't such a pansy though....THAT kinda sux.  I'm sure I'll get over it eventually, someday when I stop thinking that everyone is better than me at everything....Wow, I'm a loser.  I'm torn between whether I should ask her out now, before she leaves, or after she gets back and prom is over...I'm sure I'll make the right decision.  Today is gonna be FUCKED up, I mean..I gotta make it to an orthodontist appointment at 3:30 I believe, I'm supposed to go to the Mall of America with Ervin and Kyle, and I have to see Keli sumtime...I don't know how I'm gonna do it all, I must trust in the force.  It will be my guide....GO DORKS!  Alright, I think that's pretty much it..... Peace-Out!  I'll miss you Keli..  Spense

      Hm.....well...how do I say this.....I feel like poo.  Conrad feels that he is a horrible person, and I can't help but feel to blame for it...even though it's not DIRECTLY my fault....god I feel bad  PLUS at the moment I'm bein' told that I'm stupid for leaving the DDR party, when really, I woulda stayed, but it didn't really seem as if anyone was especially keen on me staying......why do I have such low self-esteem.  Then I see that Keli is totally, for no better way to say it, freakin' out, because she doesn't think that I actually care about her, when in reality, I TOTALLY like her, and I wish she would know that, and now she just gave me her phone number....YAY!  So, it seems I'm more wanted that I think I am, considering that Tascha* just said that she would have wanted me to stay at tht DDR party, I mean sure, she IS going out with my bestfriend, but, even he didn't seem to enthusiastic about me staying. *possibly one of the last people on the face of the Earth to say that she wanted me to stay at a party  Ya, so, I'm kinda happy right now, but I'm also kinda sad...oh well...I'll just talk to Keli sum more, she cheers me up.  YAY! Peace  Spense

      I luv being pathetic, or romantic, or kreepy, whichever you look at it.... Ya, so, I told Keli yesterday that I would talk to her today no matter what, even if I had to drive out to her house, and so that's exactly what I did, I drove out to her house just to say Hi, and if anything else happened, well, that would been kool too, but it was actually just for the purpose of saying Hi.   I wish I wasn't such a nervous bastard*sorry, bastard seems to be my word of the night..I'm saying it about everything.  Either way, I, whenever I'm around girls*especially girls that I like* become a nervous wreck, and am barely able to do anything....seriosuly anything.  Like at the movie, I was too nervous to go and get a frickin' pop, and i have no klue why, why can't I have higher self-esteem...DAMN YOU SOCIETY!!!!!  Either way, it's 12:30 in the morning..and I'm sleepy as hell...seriosuly..I don't kow why I'm this sleepy...I need to sleep, bad..and so does Steve.....wow...I just started talking with an irish accent, and I'm scottish...what the hell is wrong with me right now?!@?!??!?!?1  I want to sleep...and so does Steve, because he's ranting about how he wants his interview, because I said I would interview him about his time getting hit by a helicopter...in the PS2 game Downhill Domination..it was funny..this helicopter seriosuly just popped out of a solid rock wall, and hit Steve.....god that was funny..he doesn't get a damn interview, I'm too sleepy.  Instead, I'm gonna go to sleep and dream about Keli, god she rox... Sweet Dreams and Peacec Out!  Spense

      Kooblah....I'm kinda bored right now....no one is on MSN.....why are you people not on MSN?!?!?!  Maybe because It's the start of Spring Break and you all have lives and are doing things....meanwhile I sit at home....waiting for tonight...YAY!! I'm goin' to see the movie tonight...I wonder if it's still Starsky and Hutch...I dunno...but....I'm gonna be there, because I was invited by Keli, and I don't want to let her down.  I'm so sappy. Ya, so, if you haven't actually figured it out by now, Keli is the person I like, I mean, she's just so neat and cute....and not to mention fuckin' hott!   Ya, so....I'm pretty much stuck going to prom....even though I don't want to really, and didn't in the first place....but.....that's ok....I just gotta go and have fun. I don't know what to talk about right now.....uh......yup, that pretty much covers it.... Peace!  Spense

Ya, so....I just saw Starsky and Hutch for the second time in a row....don't get me wrong...it was a good movie, but the real reason I went was because the person I liked went too.....:-P God I'm sad.....oh well I'm full of energy for the little ammount of sleep....I'll give you a full update on Japan sumday....when I have a LOT of time...but.....ya.

      So, the last two days have been goin' great for me....a little lonely, but who's not lonely every once in a while?!?!?!  Until I just talked to Steve, who bitched at me and called me a "fucking bitch" for not caring that I "ditched" Kyle and Conor.  I didn't do a FUCKING thing....Ervin is the one who even mentioned that we were going to Rusty's...if ERVIN woulda just shut his mouth and not said anything, then there would have been no "ditching."  It would have just been peachy.  FUCK YOU!!  Brittany's was really lonely.....probably the highlight of the night was playin' ditch with a bunch of people....ME BEING THE FIRST PERSON TO SCORE!!!  w00t!!!!  Go Spenser, Go Spenser, It Cho Birfday, It Cho Birfday....WOOO!!!!  IT was fun though....lonely but fun.  Sum of the loneliness went away when Brittany and Tascha walked over to me and said that no matter what "sum people" think, they like me.  I'm kool to talk to apparently or sumthin'....it was nice.   I actually got to talk to Tascha and Brittany a little each yesterday, and that was pretty kool.  Tina got pissed at me because I was flickin' pennies and a few of them happened to hit her...sorry.  La-Ti-FRICKIN'-Da. I flick pennies...it's just what I do...not like I mean to hit anyone really.  Ervin THINKS that maybe I have awesome accuracy, but I don't, I just kinda point and shoot in a general direction, and if hits sumone, sw33t.  GAH!!  Sum people just can't take a little fun.  I want to jump on my trampoline.  The loneliest part was probably when I sat on the trampoline by myself for over an hour, and no one came and said "Hi" or anything.  I didn't get all pissed and leave though like Kyle did, however.  Him and Conor were over by the swing by themselves while everyone was on the trampoline...and they just left, and apparently we're to blame...oh.....ok :-S  I miss Keli.  If Keli woulda been there, the party woulda been a lot kooler.  I had fun anyway....but not as MUCH fun as I could've had.  Oh well.  You win sum, and sum kick you in the nuts.  WHICH HAS HAPPENED TWICE IN ONE MONTH NOW!!!!  MY GOD, why do people kick me in the nuts, it's not very nice.  Then, when I don't like the person very much who did it, people get angry at me for it.  What, I'm supposed to give them a hug for kicking me in the nuts?!?!?!?!  I don't think so....  I think I have ranted on pretty much every topic that I care to spew forth at you.  If I were to rant about EVERYTHING...you would be sitting for a while.... ya...so......I'm just....gonna....go............now...... BYE! *run away*  Spense

      I have deemed that I am doomed.  heh  deemed...doomed....that rox.  Etiher way, I am really super UBER bored...I have homework to do, but I'm too bored to do that.  I want to take a nap, but I'm too lazy to move to the couch.  I want to do stuff with friends, but they're all doing better stuff probably..and I'm too lazy to dial their phone numbers.  I'm actually losing all momentum for writing this blog...I'm gonna go get sum puppy chow and Pepsi, then I'll be right back.  **back**  I now HAVE the puppy chow and Pepsi, and i went to the bathroom....but I haven't actually opened them yet...either of them.  nope, Pepsi's open now.  and the puppy chow.  I was grumpy on the bus ride home, but then I was fine just before gettng off the bus.  The only reason I can think of is because I didn't get to hang out with Keli after school.  Why are girls so confusing???  Seriously, I never can know if they hate me, love me, don't kare, or whatever OTHER 2 billion emotions they have.    Why are girls so addicting???  Maybe they aren't too other people, but they sure as hell are to me.  Sure, it's in my family to become easily addicted to anything..which is another reason I stay away from any of those bad things, but, they're just kool!  I wish I was more deep...I don't think I am really, unless you try to get me to share emotions, then you very well could drown trying to get them from wherever they reside in me.  Everyone always talks about deep stuff, like the meaning of life...and awesome stuff like that.  I can't....I don't why, I just can't!  I would LOVE to wonder about that stuff....but I just don't.  I kinda accept things as they come.  Like the Philosophy Club or whatever Mrs. Loney is starting, I would LOVE to go to sumthing like that, but I would just kinda sit in the corner and listen...that's all I ever do, sit and listen....I'm not really a go-get-er, I'm a sit-back-and-listen.....er.  STACEY FIGHTING IS THE KOOLEST*!!!  It's just so much fun to do with a bunch of your friends when you're really bored and have nothing better to do...or when you have plenty of other things to do, you just don't wanna.  Like Kyle Bear pointed out this morning, "Didn't we stop that kinda thing when we were in fourth grade?"  Yes, we did you jackass, now go away and let us have our FUN!!!  Ah, to be a little kid again. *NOTE: The type of slow fighting we do when we're bored   Ah, to be a little kid again.  That would be nice, except for the fact that I would have even MORE school left.   Then again we get nap time, and snack breaks, and RECESS!!!  But girls still have cooties and that means no Keli...*sigh*  I wish we had recess, that would make the day a LOT more fun..and it would go by faster.  I'm constantly falling asleep during 2nd block, adn constantly getting yelled at for it...by Mr. Hjersjo and students alike.  I don't know why I'm so tired in that class.  I have nothing more to bore you with.  Peace!  Spense

      I just got done playing Metroid for like an HOUR!!!  GO DWEEBS!!!  I like being a dork...if I was anything else, I probably woulda shot myself a long time ago.  Except I'm not a dork, I'm sumthing else...I'm the crazy hybrid dork thing!!!    This is hilarious:    you know what's ALWAYS bothered me? cold cereal mascots    I mean that is just some FUCKED UP SHIT    the Trix rabbit, for example    I dunno man... if I were him I'd be fucking KILLING some kids    I remember a commercial where the fuckin rabbit WENT INTO A FUCKIN STORE AND BOUGHT A BOX OF TRIX WITH HIS OWN FUCKIN MONEY.    fuckin kids came outta NOWHERE and basically fuckin mug the poor stupid bitch rabbit    "silly rabbit Trix are for kids"    Fuckin rabbit just sits there and looks depressed.    FUCK NO that wouldn't fly with me    I'd have pimp-slapped EVERY ONE OF those fuckin bitches    and made them go get me the REST of a "complete breakfast" and eat Trix right in front of them bitches and THEN beat the shit out of them some more.     and wtf is with the disguises? All the dumb rabbit does is hide his ears and all of a sudden he's a fuckin kid?    I dunno about you, but if I SAW a 6 foot fuckin RABBIT with his ears tucked under a baseball cap, I wouldn't immediately think    "Hey, there's a cool lookin human kid, let me go over and share some of my cereal with him"    NO.    I'd be thinking    "that's a 6 foot fuckin RABBIT with his ears tucked under a baseball cap... what the FUCK was I just smoking?"    another thing... wtf is up with cereal being "A part of this complete breakfast"    last time -I- checked, cereal WAS breakfast    they show a big ass bowl of frosted flakes next to a waffle, a pancake, toast, a banana, a fuckin grapefruit... who the FUCK eats a breakfast that big    not me    I don't even EAT breakfast nomore    I mean, I eat when I get up    but the whole thought "BREAKFAST IS ONLY SERVED UNTIL SUCH AND SUCH TIME"    bitch, you make my fucking sausage and egg sandwich when I pay you the fucking money    don't give me that shit.    Back to stupid cereal mascots...    Lucky Charms.    FUCKING LUCKY CHARMS    Lucky can turn the fucking MOON into a marshmallow, and he can't escape a bunch of fucking 6 year olds?!?!?    C'mon now, Lucky.    I KNOW your bitch ass has got to have a "Blow the fucking kids up" spell SOMEWHERE    or make "kid marshamllows" and EAT those bitches.    "They're after me Lucky Charms!"    ....    KILL THEM, BITCH!    I dunno why I went off on this rant here    it's just always bothered me." Tell me that's not the greates rant ever?!?!?!  Carly reintroduced me to vgcats and bash.org...  I need a personal night tonight, for the last month or so, I've never really had a night to just sit home and do nothing*nothing including video games and T.V. watchin'*  Dave is a stud....just thought I would say that...I mean, seriously, sum of you might not even know how awesome he is, if you don't know Dave, get to know him, and ladies, he's single...I think, it's hard to tell these days 'cause he's such a FRICKIN' STUD!!!  Ya, I might be a good person, but I think I am an embarassment to men all over the world.  So, after school, Dave, Whitney, Keli, Brittany, Rachel, Ervin, and Myself, all were in the Lounge....then eventually everyone left until it was just me and Keli. So, I'm in a darkened room with the most beautiful girl in the world*not to mention the fact that she's my girlfriend* and what do I do??  I sit in the corner!  I'm such a loser...I didn't even try to get close to her.   THEN, the other night, I showed up at her house at like 9 and didn't leave until like 10, and all I did was sit and talk with her, which is just fine with me...but...GAH!!!  As soon as I get back in the car, Steve asks "So, get any??" Now STEVE is a true man, he is the prime example of a man, that boy has his mind in his pants at all times. Of course I answered no, which I was pleased with.  But man, hugging Keli is the best feeling in the world....there is seriosuly nothing better.    I've been learning sum pretty messed up stuff in Psychology lately...like about this guy named Freud...who had sum pretty messed up but awesome outlooks on the Id, Ego, and Superego and dreaming and stuff.....enough about that, I'll tell you later if you ask.  One of the weirder things I learned in that class is that we spend just about 25% of our nights *cough*....aroused.  Not just guys either, both sexes are this way.  PLUS the fact that it doesn't have to be seuxally related either, just whenever we enter REM sleep our bodies become.....aroused.   I don't know why this is so weird to me...or why it is so funny to say the word....aroused. gehehehehehe.  I'm a loser.  I'm just gonna go....now.....before I say any more stuff that could make me hate me more....... Peace Out YO!!!  Spense

No one bites back as hard On their anger None of my pain and woe Can show through  [Chorus]  Discover l.i.m.p. say it [x4] No one knows what its like To be mistreated, to be defeated Behind blue eyes No one knows how to say That they're sorry and don't worry I'm not telling lies  [Chorus]  No one knows what its like To be the bad man, to be the sad man Behind blue eyes.

      I'm sitting on the phone right now, and my mom is bitching at me for quitting my job.....after I just got home from being kicked in the nuts by Whitney at school.  DAMNIT!!!  I didn't want to be in this mood, I never like being in this mood, I hate this mood.  I save up all this anger by never getting angry at anyone, and then sumone does sumthing and I hate everything and everyone.  Now my mom is interogating me about why I'm in a bad mood, and she's asking me what a blog is.    FUCK!!!    I was in a perfectly good mood, I was really good in fact, beyond good, and now I just wanna punch a whole in sumthin' or kill sumone.  Ervin wants me to come over at 6 too, well, no way in hell that's gonna happen.  Why do people have to be stupid??? Why can't they just take two fuckin' seconds to think about what the consequences will be????  GET it through their THICK fuckin' skulls that THEY are NOT the most important person in the WORLD?!?!?!?  GOD DAMNIT!!  I wish I had am explosive...then I could blow shit up.  I mean, she just full out kicked me in the balls, I was in tears.  I was literally on the ground crying because it hurt so FUCKING much!    Now I get angry at people who ahve done absolutely nuthin'....FOR NO REASON!!!!  Except for the reason that one person did sumthing wrong...and now I hate everyone and everything.  Which, I'm not so sorry to say at the moment, but will be later, includes whoever is reading this right now...I don't even know who you are, but I hate you....  Then I think about all the other little things that would have made me angry earlier, but I supressed them, and then I get more angry...even just little things.  Even things about people I love...like Keli.  I lose all sight of anything that makes me happy, everything just becomes one large pile of shit to me, a pile of shit I want to burn and then leap on, so I can rid my own head from all this BULLSHIT that people fill it with.  I was perfectly happy less then an hour ago, then it all went away..  Then I get frustrated...because I can't find a swear to explain the anger that I feel right now.... FUCK-OUT!

      Ok, so, I haven't really updater in a long time, almost every night I've tried to get myself to blog, and get out my thoughts....but I never did, because it was usually too late by the time I got home.  I have always wanted to blog, because sumtime during the day, I will get a really interesting idea or sumthing, and I will want to write about it...but then I forget about it by the next day....I only remember three of them: 1.)Rusty 2.)Keli 3.)Peeing with one hand or two....*ew*  Ya, see, in my head I had this whole in-depth outlook on all three of these issues, but, when I try to speak about them outloud, I just sound like a retard....which I probaBly do most of the time anyway...:-S GO self-esteem!  I totally forgot what I was going to say.....shit.  Yesterday/today Rusty, Kenny, Carly, and I started a new FFCC campaign...and we kick ass!  Especailly with Carly's physics....ge he he he he.  Sorry, inside joke.  Either way, we all stayed there until like 3:30 in the morning...and then I got to drive myself home that late....fun, NOT!  It was possibly the koolest/ most perverted time in my life!!  It seriously rocked hardcore.....  TODAY IS THE DDR PARTY!!!!!  I can finally show that I don't suck AS much anymore....hopefully.  Hopefully it will be kool, and not too awkward....  I've taken up enough of your time just talking randomly.... Peace!  Spense

      I don't fit in.... I realized this while raking the lawn*on my own free will by the way* that I just am weird.  Even amongst friends and the such, I just don't fit in...I really don't kare though, which is part of the reason I don't fit in: I just don't care.  Almost all of my friends have different view points on many things...well...different then my views.    I dunno.  I will expand on this topic later...but for now I have to go hang out at Glen Park Peace Out!  Spense

      Ya, so, I've never hung out with Carly before, and then yesterday me and a whole buncha other people all went to her house and hung out*I still don't know if it's hung or hang*.  It was super kool. 1.)  When we got there, no one was there...it was neat.  Carly, Jackie, Landon, and Ky were on Ky's boat or sumthin'...so Brittany, Kyle, and myself were invited in by Carly's parents*who are really nice.....for canadians* 2.)  We were sitting in there doorway talking to Carly on the phone, and her parents invited us in, and since it's just a force of habit for me, I had already taken off my shoes, and was standing in the doorway with my socks on....it was funny. 3.)  We went downstairs and her mom was trying to tell us that we could make ourselves at home, but I had already hooked up Carly's Gamecube and was playing The Hobbit....which is a pretty kool game by the way.  A few minutes later, Conny just walked in the back door, and came in and sat down, and they all played a game called Labrynth...it looked pretty kool. 4.)  After about an hour, Carly, Jackie, and Landon showed up.*I was still playing The Hobbit*  Then Jackie and Landon and Brittany left, leaving Carly, Kyle, Conny, and me at Carly's....with me playing the Hobbit still. 5.)  This part gets a little fuzzy*I was concentrating really hard on that game*  Eventually a bunch of people showed up including Whitney, Rusty, Tom, Karl, Wittig, Jenny...I think more, I just can't remember them.  KENNY!!!!  I almost forgot Kenny, he was there too. 6.)  The people who left came back and I eventually stopped playing The Hobbit....and started playin' FFCC with other people.  *For those of you who are video gamely challenged, FFCC stands for Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles...it's an awesome game for the Nintendo Gamecube, where you use a Gameboy Advance as a controller.*  We all made new characters, and of course mine was named SpEnSe.  I was a black mage, Kenn was...sumthin'.....Rusty was sumthin' else....and Carly was this really hott character that had a huge boobs....How Final Fantasyish...:-S 7.)  We eventually quit playing and went outside with everyone else...and then we went down Carly's huge hill into her backyard area....and there was a river and we got jump it and it was fun..then we went to this field where we intended to play CTF later.*CTF=Capture The Flag* 8.)  Me and Kyle made plans to leave and go eat, which we did...but, on the way back to Carly's...I was runnin' and I stepped on a stick...which went through my shoe and stabbed my foot.....man that hurt, but Tom got it out with a knife.... 9.)  We went and got DQ and went to my house and got all black clothes for CTF, and then went back...and no one was there, they were already playin' CTF in this big field with a bunch of trees by her house. 10.)  This is getting really long. XD 11.)  We *Kyle and I* headed toward the game and we heard voices, so we headed toward them, and I told Kyle to be as sneaky as possible...I was sneaky..sumone walked right past me and didn't even notice...and just as I was gettin' close to the group..I heard "Get Off My Property!"  Then these people with flashlights started comin' down this nearby hill...so everyone started runnin' towards me...and no one really saw....and eventually we all were runnin' back for Carly's. 12.)  We all met in a field closer to Carly's, and that's when I realized that Keli had shown up.  **In the interest of saving space for the nice people at Blogger.com, I will sum up the next two hours in three words** I....LOVE...Keli! She's just so KOOL, and AWESOME, and CUTE, and HOTT!!!  That is all. Peace Out!  Spense

      Sorry...Steve, Kyle, and Ervin are watchin' Old School..and I can hear it in the background..man that movie rox!  I'm tired, it's like almost 1 AM...and i realize, that since this last summer, I've been goin' to bed earlier and earlier at sleep-overs...it sux.  I just keep gettin' more and more tired.  I don't wanna work at McD's anymore...I'm thinkin' about skipping work tomorrow just so I can get fired, and then make up sum B.S. and be happy.  It takes up too much of my time, my Japanese grades have gone to shit, and my time with friends has gone straight DOWN the pooper....DAMN YOU CORPORATE AMERICA!!!!  Thursday was really awesome...I got to go and hang out with Keli at Glen Park for a long time...not long enough though.  I wish I could have stayed there with her longer...or maybe just had sum more alone time. XP  Man, that river smelled like shit, but it was fun.... We all went down to the river and hung out*hang out? hung out? I dunno* and we got to go in the water...and I was feeling particularly stupid, so I went into the river with all my clothes and stuff, including shoes and socks.  It was pretty kool...I have no klue why I did it....I think it was some kind of plea for attention or sumthin'. ONE thing I did notice though, I was willing to almost anything for Keli...I mean, generally speaking, I don't do anything unusual anymore, but, I walked through the river just to get closer to Keli, and I dislike getting wet*usually*  Then I went in the river possibly for sum kinda plea for attention or sumthin'...I dunno. Moral of the Story??  I really like Keli.  There was sumthin' else I was gonna say, but I forgot what it was...... hm.  XS, I hate it when this happens. Peace-Out!  Spense

      I am at Kyles now...and he's not here, he's dropping Ervin off at home.  His parents won't let him drive with more than one person in the car...stupid law-abiding parents.  I have absolutely nuthin' to do, so what do I do...I update my blog!!!  I would say sumthin' about how I've been on a soul-searching quest, or or give sum advice to people or sumthin'...but, I can't..I'm just not that deep I guess.   Hm..what's new.... I wish Keli was here or sumthin'...whenever Keli is around, I feel better.  I feel so full of life, and I just wanna get up and do sumthin'.  Unfortunately, there is about 5 miles of River Falls between us.....so, feelings of life are gone and motivation to get up and do anything has dropped to insanely low levels. besides play at Glen Park. I HAVE FOUND AN AWESOME HOBBY!! Playing on the toys at Glen Park. Seriously, it is SO much fun you can't even begin to imagine...maybe I'll get sum people together and do that tonight...I dunno.  It sounds kinda fun. I luv goin' to Glen Park, it rox...when I'm playin' on the toys, I can forget all my troubles, and can leave all that stuff behind.  It's just me, a toy, and a few of my best friends playin' a game intended for 4 year olds. I would gripe about other things...but, after reading Cobian's and Brendan's blogs, it makes me not want to say anything really..and people getting angry about things I say...not pointing an fingers or anything.*cough*Tina*cough*  j/k Tina, it's kool. That is the one thing I'm going to say....I have an F'ed up friendship with Tina....one day, we'll totally be pissed at eachother, the next day one of us will forgive the other one, and then life goes on.  Even though I'm still afraid of her, and I seemed to make her paranoid of all humanity....sorry. I dunno... YOU KNOW WHAT SONG ROX?!?!?!?!  BEHIND BLUE EYES by Limp Bizkit Yes I know they didn't do the song first, but they made it kool... I think I have to go now..finally sumthin' to do!!! w00t! P.S. Tontie and Grow ROXOR THE WORLD!!!!

      I can't think of a title for this blog entry...so, I stol Conrad's instead.  XP  I'm bored...seriously, you people should be online...I'm bored..  Hey!!  I know sumthing to say. Ok, I have a question for all you people...you know, people who read my blog. Have I honestly changed anyone's oppinion on Tina by saying things on here....because she seems to think that I am making people hate her and such, and it's gettin' uber irritating...  BUTTON MEN ROCK!!!  I wish I still played Button Men with Cobian in the Percussion room every morning...that was fun.  I asked Keli Out!!  I'm happy  I don't know what else to say......

      Well....after hearing a story from Cobian and having a long conversation with him.  I have decided that I am a very sad creature upon this Earth, sent here to torture humans.    I'm sorry guys.  Boy, I sure get depressed easily...  It was a long and touching story...but in the end, it didn't have a happy ending like in the movies.  It ended up with a sad squirrel.  More knowledgeable, but sad.  I don't want to be like that....and I don't want to make people sad anymore...  I'll get over it, I promise.  Spense

      That movie ruled.  Talk about a pick-me-up...in the wrong direction however.  Ya, so, at this moment, SpiderMan 2 is da koolest movie on da face of da EARF!!  Seriously...I give it two thumbs and four mechanical claws way WAY up. It made me sad though... His life reflects mine so well it is scary, ya know, besides the super hero part and stuff.    **SPOILER...kinda** At one point in the movie, Peter and his aunt are talking about this neighborhood kid who looked up to SpiderMan, but now that SpiderMan was gone, the kid was sad.  So his aunt says these great words, that I can't remember exactly, about how self-sacrificing people are the ones considered heros.  Heros always have to sacrifice themselves for the good of everyone else.  But, in the end, it pays off, because people would wait in line just to meet that person, would sit for hours on end just to say "Hey, I met them." **END SPOILER**  That made me feel better about myself.  Spenser, Hero for the day. XD  Then, about halfway through the movie, I lean over to Ervin and say, "Tell me this relationship between MJ and Peter isn't Tina and I." He got a realy serious look on his face and said, "I can't.  I honestly can't."  Which made me feel a little weird....but happy, but sad.  ALL MIXED UP INSIDE!!  Anyway, I'm now Peter...Peter Parker.  Hero for the day.  The self-sacrificing, everyday person. I forgot what else I was going to put on here.  Oh well. Peace Out!  Spense

      I can't believe that I would be so stupid....then again I can believe that.  Keli was totally right, and I didn't even listen to her.  Tina treats me like shit...she really does.  I didn't even really notice until today, well, I did notice.  I just pushed it aside.    I can't believe myself.  I have been willfully blinded.  GODDAMNIT!!! Then I learned about sum things that Kyle has been sayin' about me...once again, behind my back.  Tina has always wondered why I get angry at her.  WHY THE FUCK WOULDN'T I GET ANGRY!?!?!?!?  I mean, come on.  I have just been led around by her this whole time, I was just a puppet. You know what the real fuckin' icing on the cake is.... I will accept her back.  I know it.  I JUST know it.    Why do I continually torture myself.  I wish it was all over. I need a vacation bad....REAL bad. Peace Out!  Spense

      It didn't help like I thought it would.  I had a plan.  Tell the two people who I have feelings for, just how I feel for them.  Got through one conversation with no problems. Second conversation was a little harder.  I had to tell Tina that I still loved her*damnit* and that didn't go so smoothly.  First, I thought it might work, but then just like in Mean Girls, there was the word vomit.  The words just kepy coming out, until I was a huddled mass on the sidewalk crying my eyes out because I love her so much, but there's nothing I can do about it.  I'm just a messenger, my feelings don't matter.  As long as other people are happy, I shouldn't give a damn. THEN WHY DOES IT HURT SO MUCH!!!  Then our conversation was cut short because her ride had arrived.  She gave me a hug though, that was the warmest hug I've ever had...maybe because of my cold heart and soul...  Then I get home and have a WONDERFUL conversation with Tascha about the whole thing.  First she wondered why I was in such a bad mood.  Then asked me why I was so hooked on Tina.  Then accused my penis for it, which I don't believe is true.  Then I got angry....now I'm talking to Brittany about being "shattered" and I'm getting more pissed.  Man, nothing is goin' right...

      Isn't it great to know that your friends have talked about you behind your back???  Not even necessarily bad things....just, behind your back.    I've been trying this new thing called "being happy", because everyone has been telling me to "be happy".  It kinda failed fast.  Especially after being called "shattered".  I know that I have been changed.  IT has changed me.  Not just IT, many things after and before IT have changed me.  Whethere for the better or worse I can't say.  I see both sides of myself.  I see the two faces.  I see the lies and deceit.  I see the love and joy.  I see the murderous hate and jealousy.  I see the calm and collected.  I would like to say I know everything about myself...but I can't.  I just don't know myself anymore.  I know that almost every day for the last two summers I was hangin' out with Kyle and Ervin, and already this summer I've spent more days at home then both summers combined.  I can't help it.  I'm a slave of my emotions.  Anyone who knew me before and after all of this can easily tell that I'm a different person.  I can even tell.  Unfortunately I can't remember who I was...  I hurt people. I get hurt. I can't trust anyone fully. I can't trust myself fully. I try to help people with their problems, I take small steps. I try to help myself with my own problems, I can't even crawl. I cause more problems... I solve more problems... I TRY TO BE CLEVER IN MY BLOG BUT FAIL LIKE THE INSIGNIFICUNT CUNT-FUCK BASTARD I AM!!! I HATE MYSELF SO MUCH!! I LOVE OTHERS SO MUCH!! I HURT OTHERS TOO MUCH!! I HURT MYSELF TOO MUCH!!  I TYPE IN CAPS TOO MUCH!!  sorry, I was getting really depressing...so i decided to make myself laugh. That's the only way I seem to be able to help people.  By making them laugh.  I wish I was useful for more than that...like actually being a half decent person. As I speak, I'm having a conversation with sumone who everytime I see them around "other people" I want RIP MYSELF IN HALF!!! There is another person whom I have hurt badly, I really didn't want to, I really wish that the one time I had made a split-second decision, I hadn't.  Yet, I don't want it to start again...because I fear that I will hurt them more.  One second I can swear to myself that I will be the loving, caring person that sumone needs and deserves..but I can't do that.    Do you have the time  to listen to me wine about nothing and everything all at once? I am one of those mellow dramatic fools neurotic to the bone NO DOUBT ABOUT IT! Sometimes I give myself the creeps. Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me. It all keep adding up, I think I'm cracking up. Am I just paranoid, or am I just stoned?  good f***in' song.   If you're sumone I know and I've hurt you recently...I'm sorry.   I'm just not me anymore.  Spense

      K...don't ask about that title...I have no klue what that means.  Possibly, that from love we have to learn to grow or sumthing.  Must be happy. That's nice.  I have heard this so much lately...but it's just not in my system at the moment.  Sure, I can be momentarily happy, from getting a hug or sumthin', but I can't seem to find true happiness.  If anyone does, don't tell me, it'll make me depressed.   I like hugs, I want more hugs damnit! EGO MOMENT: My hair rulez!  Sorry, just had to get that off my chest.  I dyed my hair blonde for anyone who hasn't seen me, it RULEZ!!!  I would put a pic of it sumwhere...but I don't have one.  So much has happened since I last blogged.  Physically and emotionally.  brb...bathroom break. Ah...I feel better.  CARLY READS BATHROOM READER!!!  **more on this later**  Let's see...what has happened? tre had a pretty kick-ass LAN/Graduation party.  Except for the alocohol the first night, sex the second night, and Tyler.  I left the first night, but spent the night the second night.  "I must have been the only guy that wasn't LANing that didn't get any"*sarcasm**kind've* heh, that was great... Have you ever walked into a room and realized that everyone in it was talking about YOU just seconds before?  It's eery...  OK, not EVERYONE, but a few people.  It sucked none-the-less.  I went to the park by myself and then came back and was immediately told to leave, so I did, then preceded to be pissed. Did I over react?  probably. Did I take it the wrong way? apparently. Did I get what I wanted? yes. I was having fun until about 1 A.M. LOADS of fun in fact.  Mostly wrestling Carly for Jackies pillow, that was awesome. Then I went to the park..and that's where it went downhill....but oh well, it's in the past.  I fell asleep on one of tre's upstairs couches, on my spiked, blonde hair. I never knew that hair could hurt to sleep on.  IT CAN. Then what? I came back home and spent the night at my moms house with Steve..that was actually kinda boring...besides the part where we went and saw DODGEBALL, the greatest movie on the face of the planet.  Then I went to the orthodontist. I GET MY BRACES OFF IN THREE WEEKS!!!  KICK @$$!!!! sorry...then what? Went to the philosophy club meeting and got flicked off and threw duct tape at people and went to DQ and stuff...it was ok, rather pissing me offish...but ok none the less.  Went to Carly's afterward to play FFCC, created a new Yuke named Puck.  He's actually an OK character...better then my last Yuke...but not as awesome as my Clavat.  Which is sumwhere at tre's house.  I lost my memory cards at tre's house.  All 5 of them, it made me sadKICK ASS!!! I just found my memory cards while writing this very sentence....Ervin can vouche for me..I'm on the phone with him when all of this went down.  YAY!!  That just made my day. NOW I HAVE MY CLAVAT BACK!!!  Along with the rest of my info...but the Clavat matters the most.XP  GYEEHOO!!  That just made my day.  Where was I?*ponder*  I've been told to read the book THE NOTEBOOK by Tina.  I keep tellin' her I don't wanna though.  Love stories make me sad*yup, I'm sad right?*even in Around The World In Eighty Days.  Just watchin' the tiny love story in it made me want to kill sumthin'.  I know there is more I wanted toOOOHHHH!!  I was contemplating starting a real journal, but then I though about it..and it would be pointless*in my opinion*the only reason I would need it is to look back on a while from now and go, "WHAT THE FUCK WAS I THINKING?!?!?!"  So, I decided not to do that.  Now I think I'm done.  Gonna go bask in the warmth of my monitor's soft loving glow. PEACE  Spense  P.S. Is that how you spell bask?  I dunno

      WTF is wrong with me?!?!?  I just got back from seeing both showings of The Day After Tomorrow...and boy did it take my mind for a whirl!  If I were to die tomorrow, who would know that I love them?  Who haven't I told?  Who have I hurt?  What have I done that could put a blemish on my name for the rest of eternity?  Does it matter?  I was sittin' there....and I really wanted sumone to put my arm around...sumone...who's not there anymore*sigh*  (I miss you, I miss you) Hello there, the angel from my nightmare The shadow in the background of the morgue The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley We can live like Jack and Sally if we want  Where you can always find me We'll have Halloween on Christmas And in the night we'll wish this never ends We'll wish this never ends  (I miss you, I miss you) (I miss you, I miss you)  Where are you and I'm so sorry I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight I need somebody and always This sick strange darkness  Comes creeping on so haunting every time And as I stared I counted  Webs from all the spiders Catching things and eating their insides Like indecision to call you and hear your voice of treason Will you come home and stop this pain tonight Stop this pain tonight  Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you) Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)  Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you) Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)  Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you) Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)  Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you) Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)  (I miss you, I miss you)  (I miss you, I miss you) (I miss you, I miss you) (I miss you, I miss you)  *sigh* You know who you are...  FUCK!!! Shit-headed-duche-fucks...that's a good way to describe people like me.  Thank you.  anyway...back to the movie. It was a good movie...even though sum parts were unrealistic...oh well, and then to make things worse...it was love songs on the radio all the way home.  Ironic huh???  Life is out to get me... "Drowning in Life"...sounds like the name of a song. Gonna go to bed now...Sweet dreams everyone.  Forgot what I was gonna write about, besides all this. Peace!  Spense

      You ever been really hurt by sumone, but never really noticed until like a day later... ya, it sux.  I dunno know what to say right now....besides the fact that Brittany and Tascha are DA KOOLEST!!!  Steve was there too...I guess he's kinda kool....:- Sorry about bein' so antisocial at Brittany's.....but, I realized that I had been hurt really bad by sumone.....and didn't even notice because of my own stupidity.  So, I wasn't in the keenest mood to hang around sum people...and no, it was not because of who it usually is....which was a nice change.  I'm gonna go, before I make myself more depressed....'cause we can't go to the beach today...and I really wanted to.   I still want to hang out with people if sumone wanted to call me and be like "Hey, I'm bored.  Let's do SUMTHIN'!!!"  That'd be sweet...too bad it's not gonna happen... Peace!  Spense

      Three days in a row of blogging....I'm on a roll...I'll have to keep on goin'.  Today was full of happiness, until the end of it....that was sad..I have hurt sumone yet again, and boy do I feel like shit.  I had to wake up by 9:30 so that I could hang out with Brittany... I hung out with Brittany at her house... A bunch of us climbed around Glen Park for a while... That was UBER fun... Then we went to DQ... Where I got really quiet... Then we went and hung out at Tina's... We made arrangements to hang out at my house... A bunch of people came to my house... Tina and I spent a large ammount of time trying to kill each other with a frisbee/football... We played a kickass game of CTF*...         *CTF=Capture The Flag I ran from Tina in my woods and we both got scratched up pretty bad... I got a stick to the eye... We went to Kyle's... We played MORE CTF... I was the ride bitch... I got angry because people left and I wanted to talk to sumone... I caused sadness... I'm sitting here writing this...  Think that pretty much covers it...anything with a "..." after it means that sum other stuff happened in there, but I don't have all night! Today was fun....yet overall depressing...that sux. Everything has it's ups and downs...poo. Now I run off to Dream Land to pursue happiness... Nighty Night!  Spense

      wow...talk about depressing.  That post just made me want to shoot myself....I never knew I could BE that depressing.  Now I know why people don't like me :- Why does everyone hate everyone else so much anyway???  Seriously, it's not like anyone means it...we're gonna get over it in a day or two anyway, and we'll just look back sumday and laugh.  "Boy I sure was dumb for thinkin' blah blah blah."  The Drive-In was pretty fun. I spent almost all of Prisoner of Azkaban talking to Tina about Cobian.  That wasn't TOO bad.  She was hurting pretty bad, and I like to make people feel better, so, I did what I could, which probably wasn't enough...and I had seen the movie once before, and wasn't THAT impressed, everything after LOTR just hasn't been that great to me.....I gotta stop comparing things to eachother....otherwise I'll always be dissappointed most likely.  Watched Mean Girls, that was a great movie.....mmm....girls*drool*  Sat by myself for most of that wrapped in a blanket with my twizzlers.  After that was over it was about 2 A.M. and we were debating whether to leave or not...and we finalyl decided to after sum friends* of Meekers came over and started "partying."  *I know, I didn't know he had friends either!* Got home and went to sleep.  Spent most of today with no Gamecube or XBOX....just my PS2 and computer.  Then when I went to get it, Ervin wasn't home, so Steve and I went to the High School to get the keys from him...we barely got them without suffering pain of death.  Got BACK to Ervin's house and his mom was home now...so the keys were useless.  Got my stuff and then headed back to the High School.  Steve walked in during practice and lots of people yelled at him..it was funny.  Looked for Keli in the room, didn't see her.  Talked to Tina in the hall for a few seconds though.  Then went and returned FFCC to Blockbuster...late.*DAMN YOU ERVIN!!!!*  And ate at McDonalds...restaurant, not the people who host DDR parties. Got home and came to Steve's..and that's where i currently reside.  Just talked to Cobian about a dream he had that sounded pretty sweet.  I don't have dreams anymore.  I remember when I had lots of dreams.  Those are just shattered memories now...  Memories scare me...more than anything in this world or the next.  Memories will destroy me.  You just watch and see.

      So much hate...  but for what?  BECAUSE of what?  This crazy little thing called "love"?  BAH!  I think back to the older days...back when we were young.  Take a trip with me.  **FLASHBACK**  You just got to school, it's your first day.   You walk into class.  You're nervous because you don't know anyone. A few minutes pass and you walk farther into the room, clutching your mom or dads hand with all your might, after taking off your coat. All the other kids are laughing and playing, you're an outsider. Your parents send you off to play with the other kids while they talk to your teacher. You nervously aproach sum of the other kids, who are playing with a farm puzzle.*RUSTY!!!!* They ask if you want to play with them, you shyly nod your head. Everything's ok...  There's the killer.  Everything's ok.  Why can't everything just be ok???  **Lets fast-forward a little more**  It's your third grade. You have friends now, good friends.  Friends that you've promised to be frfiends forever with, even to college and past marriage. Marriage. Who would think of marriage?!?!?!  Girls have cooties and boys are stupid. You go outside for recess and laugh and play with your friends. After recess you come inside and have milk and cookies. You feel a little tired so you put your head down and you take a quick snooze. Life is good...  Doesn't that sound nice?  You're awoken by a slap to the face. You fell asleep in American Lit. again. The kid in front of you turns around and smacks you on the back and says "Good job, Dumbass." Life's a bitch now. Your girlfriend/boyfrfiend is cheating on you, you're failing your classes, and you just drooled all over your notes. dang...  **Flashback ends**  wasn't that fun???  Thought so...  I wish life was easier. Over and Out!  Spense

      SO...  Talk about revelations, I just got a major one from a quiz I took online from a link I got on Carly's blog... I'm a gutless bastard. Seriously, when was the last time that I ever had the guts to do ANYTHING...besides climb around on the top of Kyle's car while he's driving 50 down my road... I have absolutely NO backbone in my system.  _____ ( 0 0 )  |___|     |  =~|~=O         ~|~ {}   ~|~ {}   ~|~ []   ~|~ {}   ~|~ /|  ~|~    _____ ( 0 0 )  |___|      =   =O            {}       {}       []       {}       /| Well...that took a very long time to create...and now I have completely forgotten why I was depressed in the first place... Good Night and Sweet Dreams EVERYONE!!! "God bless us all, everyone."-Little Timmy*or whatever his name is*  Spense        P.S. Just posted this..and when I made it, the backbone lined up...so, you're gonna have to use your imagination...because it doesn't in my blog.  Stupid blog o' DOOM!  Spense(DUH!)

      This has pretty much been the theme of my life so far...  Why does she not like me? Why does SHE not like me? Why is he better then me? Why are they better then me? Why am I not happy? Why can't I just be content? Why do I worry so much? Why did I stay up all night before the last day of school? Why can't other people make up their minds? Why does he piss me off so much? Why does she piss me off so much? Why do THEY piss me off so much? Why am I not special?  I'm such a downer...I wish I was happy.  I wish everyone was happy, but for one person to be happy, sumone else must get hurt...at least that's how High School seems to work. High School is over for now however.  Ever wish you would never see sumone ever again???  And spend hours upon hours into the night just praying and hoping that everything will work out, and people can just be happy, and you could just move on with your life?  Trapped...that's my new theme....I'm trapped. I can't move forward without hurting and can't move backward without hurting, whether it is MY pain or sumone elses...there is always pain.  Why can't people just see it?!?!?!  I try to help one person...but just hurt myself.  I can't talk to this person about it...especially because it's summer now...but i couldn't during school either.  I'm shy too.    Tina was just about ready to cry at the lunch table...and I couldn't do anything to help, evn though I wanted to really badly.  People try to help me, but I can't do anything but cry.    If you were to spend any ammount of time around me, you would be able to tell what I'm thinking...Why can't people help me??  Why must I be so shy and conceded?    Anytime sumone tries to get in my shell, I push them away.  If sumone were to get inside my shell, I would be open and vulnerable, open to more pain...  Can't get hurt anymore...  The pain has to stop. The only way I know how to stop the pain is to cause more pain.  I would be philisophical about this, and say that this is all just a big test or sumthing and it will end eventually, and people will be happy.  That's NOT gonna happen anytime soon.

      3 long posts in one day?!?!?&nbsp; WHO KNEW?  There is one memory in my head.....just one that I cannot release.&nbsp; The rest seem to fade with time, flitter away into the darkness, like moths to the flame they swarmed, ready to die, ready to be eaten and spit out by the eternal hell that is forgotteness.  The first... I remember what I was wearing, I remember what she was wearing.&nbsp; I remember how cold it was outside the car.&nbsp; I remember almost every word that was said.&nbsp; I remember how special I felt, how warm she was.&nbsp; I remember the first contact.&nbsp; I remember the taste.&nbsp; I remember the smell.&nbsp; I remember my friends.&nbsp; I remember the problems.&nbsp; I remember a good friend. I don't want to anymore. I want it all to go away.&nbsp; It is the one string that is unable to break...it is what holds the quilt of my thoughts together.&nbsp; I must remove this one string.&nbsp; When it leaps from the flames, it brings an unstoppable army of memories, rampaging in my mind.&nbsp; They are uncontrollable.&nbsp; They sweep over my mind like an ocean of pain and misery, with every memory comes another blast of insignifigance.&nbsp; They make me feel dead, like I am unworthy of Human eyes.&nbsp; I curse my hands, eyes, and lips.&nbsp; I try to scar them, try to change who I am and what they are to me.&nbsp; Only reminders of a time not so long ago that will never be again. My life hasn't been the same since.&nbsp; It may never be the same.&nbsp; All I can do is try, and if my will is not great enough, then clearly the gods must want me to suffer through this inner turmoil, and I was not meant to forget for sum reason, sum....purpose that my weak mind cannot grasp.&nbsp; There are many things that my mind cannor grasp anymore.&nbsp; It is losing it's grip on reality.&nbsp; I slowly but surely sink lower and lower into insanity.&nbsp; Not the insanity that you read about, the insanity inside everyone of us.&nbsp; The longing for chaos, it swallows me now.&nbsp; It wants me to embrace it, I say no, it pulls harder.&nbsp; You MUST it screams at me, but i can't.&nbsp; I must hold onto the one last thing that keeps me alive, that keeps me going.&nbsp; Whenever I feel as if it no longer has it's grasp on me, it reminds me that it will ALWAYS have a tight grasp around my mind.

      Ya, that song roxorz hardcore!&nbsp; But, back to yesterday.&nbsp; When I went to bring Tina home to get her IPod we listened to Chimera on the way there.&nbsp; *never really liked that stuff* So I took it out and put in the first CD I could find in Brittany's car, which, Ironically, was entitled "Who do you  LOVE  to  HATE. "&nbsp; Isn't that funny?!?!&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; You bastards.  It's funny, people post in their blogs puts around topics and hint at things, and what does that accomplish?&nbsp; nothin' much.&nbsp; I get right to the topic, what does it accomplish?&nbsp; People hate me, but at least something gets done.  ************************  About 2 and 1/2 hours ago I got back from Brittany's house, I went there to eat Jell-O.&nbsp; If it weren't for the Jell-O, I honestly have no idea why I even got to Brittany' house.&nbsp; I normally woulda left after being dissed at Tina's house.&nbsp; I went down there and basically spent an hour and a half being ignored/dissed/pissed off.  It really is the little things that get to ya.  I'm such a hypocrite....I'm putsing around the topic.... LOOK! &nbsp;  Either way, it blew ass.  **EDIT**Then I took a nice long two hour shower/bath.&nbsp;&nbsp; Much needed mind you. ************************  I feel so damn lonely.&nbsp; All of my friends either have girlfriends or are seriously interested in sumone who likes them back, what do I have?&nbsp; My computer.&nbsp; Probably the only thing that brings me comfort nowadays.  "You try so hard to be someone, that you forget who you are."&nbsp; Those words were just sung in the music I'm listenin' to.&nbsp; **SPIDERMAN 2 Soundtrack.&nbsp; Thank you Kathleen**  I spend so much time with my computer, hiding all my feelings away killing things and such, that I think I've forgotten how to successfully interact with people.&nbsp; See...people have these things called "feelings."&nbsp; Computers don't.&nbsp; They don't have feelings, they don't make me feel lonely.&nbsp; I talk to my computer, and it takes the information and puts it on the screen in front of me, and I feel satisfied.  ************************  Less people seem to visit my blog day-by-day.&nbsp; It may just be the internet, but, even that gets me mildly depressed nowadays.&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy, I am a sad excuse for a life form.   "But I have a purpose"* she is the one* "and I have to fight this"* she is the one* "villian I can't knock down." *she is the one*  Man, I love this sountrack.  Either way, it's probably because of my retarded teen-angsty ways.&nbsp; "oh my god, the world hates me so much.&nbsp; My life is terrible.&nbsp; Why does everyone hate me?"&nbsp; heh...where have I heard THOSE words before??*cough* previous topic *cough*  I'm gonna go now...  I know that I forgot sumthing....oh well.&nbsp; Peace Out!   Spense

      I was gonna do that whole "Instructions:Write ten statements. Each intended for a different person.Never tell which one is to whom," thing, but, I got to the first one and and went: " OH CRAP! "&nbsp; I'm not very subtle, I would have  NO  idea whom to write about, and I would feel bad about it later. "It's in the past."&nbsp; This sentence is a 100% piece of  BULLSHIT . Just thought I'd say that. As long as I still have memories( damn them ) nothing will truly be "in the past," because it will still be fresh in my mind.&nbsp; So many things I have just tried to flick off and say "It's in the past,&nbsp; There's nothing I can do."&nbsp; Yes, it may be true, but, I will still regret it or think about it or any other emotion that comes with remembrence. "Just move on."&nbsp; That sentence is pretty crappy, too.  Dang, now I'm in a self-pitying/depressed mood. ************************************************************************** What did I do today? I woke up around noon.&nbsp; Got UBER-bored.&nbsp; Remembered that Brittany was goin' to Minneapolis at 2.&nbsp; Decided to call her and see if that was still happenin'.&nbsp; Her, Tina, an Kathleen were all at Perkins.&nbsp; So I decided to go over there, because they told me to.&nbsp;  I was playing with the lines, and they were laughing at me.&nbsp; Then Tina's mom came in, when Tina was supposed to be at her dad's....and I got the  LAST  laugh. Then Brittany drove me home to change outfits.&nbsp; I did. Then we all went over to Tina's dad's house and watched a really funny movie. Left there and went to ShopKo, where we hung out for like 1/2 an hour.&nbsp; All the girls bought sumthing, but Ervin and I didn't.&nbsp; We're cheap/poor.  :-D  Then we went to Tina's mom's house and dropped off Tina so she could go to Glen Park and take pictures with Rachel or sumthin'.&nbsp; We hung around outside her house for like 1/2 an hour, after she was already gone, eatin' J-e-l-l-o.&nbsp;  It's ALIVE!!!!  Then Brittany brought me home, and we pulled in right behind my dad, and I quick dashed inside and stated that I was home before he got home.&nbsp; Hung out and took a shower and ate sum dinner.&nbsp; Waited for Brittany to come pick me up, which never happened.&nbsp; We were waitin' for Kathleen to get home, so we could go to Minneapolis and get a new buddha for Brittany's car. Instead, I just ended up going bowling with Molly, Kathleen, and Ervin.&nbsp; Which was uber-fun.&nbsp; My second game was WAY better then my first game.&nbsp; I won the second one, but lost the first one.....uberly! Then afterwards we went to Applebees, where we sat and ate.&nbsp; It was nice.&nbsp; I felt*and still feel* uber guilty for making Kathleen and Molly pay though..... :-( *BAD SPENSER* Then we went back and sat outside Kathleens' house for like an hour or sumthin'.  I'm tired now...I think I will retire to my bedroom chamber.  Spense  &nbsp;

      I really needed to post sumthing new.  Ervin is blabbing to me about Magic: The Gathering as we speak.&nbsp; I'm not really paying attention.&nbsp; Oh well.  I wanna play FFCC more, but Kyle and Steve went back to Kyle's in the middle of the night.... bastards.   I really wish I had sumthin' to talk about, sumthin' interesting, so that people would comment.&nbsp; But I just can't.&nbsp; I have absolutely nuthin' on my mind......well, not really.&nbsp; Nothing really interesting that I care to talk about.&nbsp; I dunno.  The world is just so upside-down now.&nbsp; Everything that I thought was, isn't.&nbsp; This sounds like a type of thing for Rusty.&nbsp; Rusty has the amazing ability to adapt to anything, which is why he's so damn good at EVERYTHING!&nbsp; He can adapt to anything, I wish I had that ability.&nbsp;  No use getting worked up over it.&nbsp; My life is bareable.&nbsp; I think I'll deal with it.  shit.....I  totally  just had sumthin' to say....but it's gone now.

      So many people begin bein' sad just as soon as I start accepting life and bein' happy.&nbsp; That or maybe I just noticed it more now....oh well.&nbsp; I feel bad for you guyses, bein' sad and depressed sux a lot.&nbsp;  &nbsp; My dad bought me the Wicked Soundtrack...I've listened to it probably over 20 times so far.&nbsp; It just rocks so much. &nbsp; I like cookies.&nbsp; I like 'em a lot.&nbsp; I'm eatin' sum right now. &nbsp; Man, the last two days have just been full of ego boosters.&nbsp; First, after swimmin' at Kathleens with a bunch of people.&nbsp; When I got re-dressed, I put on my shirt not buttoned up, too much work, and everyone was complimentin' me and stuff....I felt special.&nbsp; They even took pictures! &nbsp; Then today I went and hung out with Kyle, Molly, Kathleen, and Ashley for a while, still wearin' the same clothes from yesterday because I spent the night at Ervin's.&nbsp; Stupid Ervin for pushing me up against the wall. >:-(&nbsp; I was a "hippy" today too, I didn't wanna put on any socks, so I didn't, then I kept my shirt unbuttoned most of the day, too damn lazy. Eventually we went back to Kathleen's after goin' to McD's to bug Ervin at work. XD&nbsp; Where we sat around for a long time outside, and Kyle said the best line ever: Me:Why the hell is so hot outside? Kyle:It might be because it's summer, but don't quote me on that. It was seriosuly great. We eventually went inside to the AC*\/\/007!* and then Zack and ashley left, after the saddest game of Cherades ever! Then we decided to watch A Knight's Tale, because neither Molly or I had seen it. Then after that was done, we went outside and played basketball for a really long time. &nbsp; Dang, all the cookies are gone now. X( &nbsp; This is so wierd.&nbsp; Ervin and I are single, Steve has a girlfriend, and Kyle is on a date as we speak.&nbsp; You would think Ervin and I would have girlfriends, Steve would be on a date*with eighty girls* and Kyle is single.&nbsp; The world has turned upside-down!&nbsp; OH NO!!!&nbsp; Hold on for dear life.*slip* SHIT! &nbsp; Alright, I'm just wierd now......Peace Out! &nbsp; Spense &nbsp; P.S. LESS THEN 12 HOURS UNTIL I GET MY BRACES OFF!!!!

      I got back from a church dance which totally sucked besides the last 1/2 hour. I was sitting there bein' all lonely like, when a group of girls starts walkin' towards me.&nbsp; Me, thinking they're just another group of girls headed for the door, try to not pay attention and possibly move out of the way. They weren't headed for the door. They stop and start talking to me.*what did I do to deserve this?&nbsp; It's not my Birthday.* So, this group of like 8 really cute girls are talkin' to me because I looked lonely*\/\/007!&nbsp; Loneliness prevails!* Then a slow dance comes and one asks me to dance.*MORE \/\/007!* We dance. Dance ends. I go to find my "evil friends".*don't ask* One of my previous friends, who's pretty hott herself, comes up and hugs me good-bye. Then the group of girls comes back and they call give me hugs good-bye. We're walking to the car, and the group of girls comes back.&nbsp; This time they ask for my phone number!&nbsp; I give it.&nbsp; I'm not an idiot! We go home. I'm here now, still dazed by my awesome luck. &nbsp; Now that I have said all the good stuff, here's come the unfortunate bad.... &nbsp; I'm so damn lonely.&nbsp; Sure, I have lots of friends, lots of really  AWESOME  friends.&nbsp; Yet, I always long for more companionship.&nbsp; I HAD companionship, but I kinda fucked that up with Keli.&nbsp; damn. &nbsp; Oh well, life will always go on.

       This whole message is written in webdings.  This whole message is written in webdings. &nbsp; That was  funny . &nbsp; So...last night(after beating FFCC) Rusty went to play practice, and I sat outside playing Golden Sun for two hours.&nbsp; It was supposed to be only one hour, but Rusty forgot to look at the second page of his schedule booky thing. &nbsp; It was fine by me, I got to play video games. XD &nbsp; Molly and Kathleen walked past and said Hi.&nbsp; They were on their way to the play just down the hall...area...thing.&nbsp; Then Rusty's practice got out just as the other play had it's intermission, so Molly and Kathleen talked to Rusty and I for a while. &nbsp; We were on our way back to Rusty's house when we saw Kyle and Tom niking to Ervin's(who was at work) but we forgot to tell them. :-S&nbsp; Then we got back to Rusty's houseand we played badmitton for a while, I, of course, won.&nbsp; Fore I am the  BADMITTON GOD.&nbsp; FOOLISH MORTAL! &nbsp; Then after that, we called Ervin to see if we could come over.....but he was at work. DOEY!&nbsp; So we decided to go for a swim instead.&nbsp; I got lots of water up my nose...that sucked. &nbsp; Then we went inside and updated our blogs about how  WE PWNED FFCC HARDCORE!!!!&nbsp;  While we were doin' that, Ervin got home from work, and we chatted up a storm with him.&nbsp; He was bored, we were bored, we wanted to hang out, he wanted to hang out.&nbsp; We decided to have Ervin spend the night, too! &nbsp; We preceded to go and pick him up, and on the way back, we really had an urge for Pizza.&nbsp; We stopped at Pizza Hut: CLOSED. &nbsp; So we got to Ervin's...where I had to knock on the door for like 10 minutes before he got there.&nbsp; Then we decided to stop at Dominos and get pizza there instead.&nbsp; After we had decided what to order, we just sat and waited for our pizzas for like 1/2 an hour, and every girl that walked past the window we commented on, we had a good laugh.&nbsp; Then the pizzas got done and we drove back to Rusty's to eat them.&nbsp; Here's a piece of diologue in the car: Ervin:This is kinda erotic, havin' the hott pizzas right on my crotch. Rusty:Mm, mm, apple f waitaminute.  Spense:hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.....hahahaha......ha.....WHOO! &nbsp; We got home and ate the pizzas, and then Ervin had never seen Something About&nbsp;Mary, so we had to watch that.&nbsp; With Rusty, Ervin, and I sayin' "damn." like every two seconds......mm, mm Cameron Diaz. &nbsp;  OH! &nbsp; I almost forgot to talk about how Rusty was practically falling asleep while eating the pizza, it was funny.&nbsp; Then during the movie I gave them the two last sodas....damn my big heart. &nbsp; During the movie, Rusty got hot or sumthin' and took off his shirt....so I decided it was shirtless'o'clock, and took off my shirt too, and told Ervin to follow suit.&nbsp; Then when the movie got over, we had a shirt takin' off contest *pleeze for the love of GOD don't ask*    &nbsp; Then I started thinkin' about our 7th grade play, Lagooned.&nbsp; Rusty said he had it on video, and I wanted to watch it.&nbsp; Rusty was tired, so we didn't get to watch it.&nbsp; We went upstairs, where Ervin and Rusty played Magic until around 4:30ish, and I looked at old yearbooks.&nbsp;  Why were so many people pudgy in Middle School?!?!&nbsp;  including myself .    &nbsp; We heard some people movin' around and stuff, and then a car drive off at like 50 MPH.&nbsp; First thought in all of our heads:&nbsp; Who would be driving that fast at 3 in the morning?&nbsp; Oh well. &nbsp;  OH!!! &nbsp; I almost forgot about pantsless'o'clock.&nbsp; Which is an actual time.&nbsp; It lasts from 4:04 till 5:04 A.M.&nbsp; Since we awake almost the whole time during that, we decided to celebrate it.&nbsp; I put my pants back on after like 15 minutes...so did Ervin.&nbsp; Rusty, however, didn't.&nbsp; That was kreepy.&nbsp;  &nbsp; When we were finally goin' to bed, Rusty was closing the blinds because the sun was coming up, and then he saw it.&nbsp; The toilet paper all over his small area of trees.&nbsp; The guard people had striked!&nbsp; We didn't pay attention to it really, and went to bed.&nbsp; 5 hours later at about 10:30, Rusty and I woke up.&nbsp; I immediately went outside to start cleaning up the toilet paper, which didn't take long, seeing as how the the guard did  THE SHITTIEST JOB OF TPING EVER!&nbsp;  It was seriosuly terrible, the best part of it was when I looked at the garage door and happened to see sumthing stuck to the door.&nbsp; I went to investigate...Spenser found a Maxipad glued to Rusty's garage door.&nbsp; I started laughing hysterically, and went inside to go get Rusty and show him.&nbsp; I thought it was hilarious.&nbsp; After cleaning everything up, Rusty and I went and beat FFCC for the SECOND time.&nbsp; That was fun, then he drove Ervin and me home.&nbsp; That leaves me here, typing this  UBER -long post.&nbsp; There was probably more in there sumwhere.&nbsp; I'm just too tired of typing to go into anymore detail.&nbsp; Alright, talk to you all later hopefully. &nbsp; Spense!

      So...as of 5ish...Rusty and I BEAT FFCC INTO THE GROUND!!!  It fells great.  I have never known Joy like this before!  Ya, so I;m pretty damn sad that beating a video game gives me the greatest joy in the world....so what?  kiss my ass!  GOD..that was such a FSKIN' great game!  Seriously, I've never played a better game in my life.  Also, for anyone that's ever played it...we rescued the princess, and the rumors are true.  I got a kool 100,000 gil for doin' so.  I will never have to ask for gil ever again!  NEVER!  Since both people who did so(Rusty and I) got 100 grand...he gave his to me!  So I actually have 200 grand.   I'll probably give it to Steve though...seeing as he's the only person on my memory card besides me...  Then I rode a camel....and saw a pony.  Ya...I'm so damn extatic(sp) right now....it rulez!  I'm gonna go waste energy....sumhow......:- Spense

      Times are good.    I just got back from my very first party where I haven't gotten pissed or horribly depressed.  Even though I feel really bad for crushing Tascha on the way home.  Sorry Tashca.  Whoever sees her next....tell her I'm sorry.:-S  Sum people just aren't nice.  Sum people are.  Sum people are, and get hurt because of it.  Sum people aren't and get everything they could ever ask for.  This is a dear life lesson.  Sum people just are ____*insert verb here*  It doesn't even have to stop there.  It can be Sum people just ____*insert insert anything you feel like really.*  I don't know what else to type really....I'm just really happy.  Sumthing I haven't been for a millenia it seems.  I don't know even if it's happiness, as much as content.  Nope, that can't be it.   I'm plenty happy...but I'm pretty discontent..and I don't know why.  I think I know why...obviously because I'm missing sumthing in my life..what it is I have a good idea.  But, I'm still not quite sure...the empty void could be filled with any number of things.  Including Tomato Paste.  Alrighty, time for this happy camper to check out! PEACE!  Spense

      SHOULD BE SHOT!!!  Seriously, they called 4 times this morning...BEFORE 1'o'clock....which meant that I was still asleep.  Stupid telemarketers.  Ya know what else pisses me off.  Sleep.  Who decided that suddenly my body would ahve a change and 10 hours of sleep wasn't gonna be enough for me?  I remember the good ol' days when I could EASILY get by on 7....damn childhood.  uh....don't really know what else to blog about, besides....  THAT DAMN PRINCESS!!(this one probably needs explaining) O.k. in the AWESOME game FFCC(Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles) there is a Princess who has gone missing, and it is an optional quest thing to go and find her.  The prize for finding her....100,000 gil.  Now that's a butt-load o' money.  I would like to have this money.  So, me being the greedy little guy that I am, go and try to find the Princess(with the help of an online strategy guide...well....actually...like 2 or 3 of 'em) AND NOTHING HAPPENED LIKE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO!  So I didn't find the Princess before I went to bed, AND I was angry.  I did get Excalibur though...THAT was a plus.  Didn't find the damn Princess though....stupid Princess.  Now that I have wasted an entire entry on being brumpy at things....on a lighter note: Life is good, I enjoy it now.  I don't understand why I just let things slide earlier then this.  I could have been this happy a long time ago....Yes, I'm actually happy.  I'm not just yankin' anyones chain.  BE HAPPY! XD  Spense

      I need a vacation bad.  Not just from this town, from people.  I took Steve's airsoft gun and was "shooting" people with it, even though I had no bullets or ammo, it was fun to just aim it at people and pull the trigger.  I took that as a bad sign...:-S  People I care for, people I have newly discovered I cared for, people I dislike, people I dislike a lot, it didn't matter.  I just pulled the trigger, and it felt good.  Then I went away from them all in the loft area, and no one was even looking for me or nuthin'.  They were talking about me quite a bit though....but not actually lookin' for me.  Which makes me feel as if...if I do go away on a vacation, no one would kare.  It wouldn't even affect people, most of you probably wouldn't even notice that I left, unless I had announced it.  Which also makes me think, that if I were to take a permanent vacation....no one would kare.  That's just depressin' right there.  All except for one of you.  Carly told me not to disappear forever...that was nice.  For once in the evening, I felt wanted....not even wanted, just....noticed.  Sumone noticed that I was alive.  heh...I had a funny thought earlier today when I had first arrived at Brittany's and there was still sum akward stuff goin' on.  I wanted to see what people would do if you got them drunk then gave them a gun.  Not everyone in the world, just people in our friend group.  Basically, I can break it down into two groups: those who would shoot themselves, and those who would shoot everyone around them.  I can think of people in both cases...  I'm gonna go now...before I get more messed up and more depressing/pissed and stuff.  Spense  P.S. Damn everyone who wouldn't give me a ride home.  Damn you, and you, and...OH...especially you.

      What the hell is wrong with people?!?!?!  No, I'm not discluding myself from this group.  I'm probably the main subject in it.  I have just realized that other people have sum of these "problems" like me.  We seem to...have, PROBLEMS, releasing our true feelings toward certain individuals...or...ALL individuals.  We, as Molly has pointed out in her blog, are EXTREMELY manipulative.  We say and do things just so that people will act certain ways or do certain things.  We talk behind peoples backs and say terrible things about them but then act friendly to their face.  I forgot where I was going with this...I'm felling very.....apathetic at the moment.

      Wow...that is sumthin' I never thought I would see.  Tina actually responded to my blog..which I must now talk to her about...if you aren't her...you can probably skip to... *SKIP* 1.)Look at the date on that blog entry, it was created before I had talked to you about that.  2.)I realize I'm not being fair...why does it matter?  I realize you're not to blame...I'm not retarded!  3.)I'm done with trying to keep others happy, it fuckin' sucks alright?  **EDIT**4.)I said that I was hapy to see you happy, WAS.  I also said that I have to get over you, thus eliminating feelings I had for you, or feelings involving you.  **EDIT**5.)I'm over it by now.  I admit, yes, I was pissed.  I honestly don't give a flying fuck now.  It's over.  You obviously don't understand the concept of, this is how I feel right now at this moment in time, not forever. (Not trying to diss)  Even though you seem to be farely good at it yourself.  Things are kool now.  *UN-SKIP* ...about here.  Now, where was I...  Just saw Spiderman 2 for the third time, and I must say, everytime I see that movie, it leaves a deeper impression on me.  This time I saw it with Rus....Carly and Rusty.  Ladies first. XD  Anyway, it's a good frickin' movie....and if you haven't seen it, you should.  **BATHROOM BREAK**  ah...I feel better.  While I was up there, I was reminded of a an old favorite CD of mine.  Pokemon 2.B.A Master, what a great CD.  So I grabbed it and plopped it into my Computer...and am now listening to it....that doesn't sound right.  oh well.  Hm...on with life.  Say you bump into sumone on accident, or accidently touch sumone.  What if they don't pull away?  Does that mean anything?  Had they noticed, and just hoped to keep that small bit of contact between the two of you for as long as you can?  Had they just not noticed it?  Do they even consider you to be important enough to notice you?  Are they here for sumone else?  What does it all mean?  "In my dream....I'm Spiderman, and I'm climbing these walls, but I keep slipping."  Ah, good stuff.  Man, if it's true that everyone is going through the same things that I am...well, not the SAME things...but similar troubles...BOY do I feel bad for you guys.  I forgot what I was talkin' about....I'll try to remember and update again. Peace!  Spense   **EDIT**  I'm happy for Keli.  She seemed to move past me pretty quickly.  That's good.  It's always kinda sad to see people not move on with their lives, not dwell in the past.  Not pathetic sad, but like....."sorrowful" sad.  Good Job Keli!  That is all.  Spense

      I honestly can't put my thoughts into words at the moment, besides for HOLY SHIT!  Honestly.....I  can't    speak.... Everything that I thought was true, everything that I just believed.....GONE OUT THE WINDOW!!! oh my god.  What the hell am I going to do?  Wow...talk about throwin' my mind for a loop.  I...never expected that. Next I'm going to find out that both of my recent girlfriends are druggies or sumthin'...OH MY GOD!!! I thought I was blind about the Tina thing....SHIT son.....I missed sumthin' even bigger..well, not more important....sumthin' probably even more obvious.  ...dang...  Alright, now that I have said that....but not even close to out of my system.  This must be what a mental breakdown feels like. Now...for most people...this probably wouldn't be such a big thing.  But I'm good little Mormon boy....I don't do anything wrong...well....ok, that's a lie.  But....SHIT!  just.....wow.  Just saw Spiderman 2 for the second time.  I really want to memorise that section of dialogue between Peter and his aunt.  That totally explaiins to everyone why on Earth I would ever hurt myself for others like I do.  **Namely Tina.**  I think I might have to talk to her again, this shit is too much to think through.    Damn...out.  Spense   FUCKIN' CHRIST!  This night just keeps gettin' better and better.  NOT! **Adult content in this blog entry...keep virgin ears away** translation:I'm gonna do a FUCK-load of swearing!  SHITFUCKASSFUCKSHITBITCHCUNTASSFUCKTARDSHITPENISCUNTRAGFUCKSHITHEAD! and that's only the beggining folks!  I just read Brittany's blog.  it said that Tina was "hyper happy" at the movie.  I asked her why.  She said that maybe Tina should tell me.  I convinced her to tell me anyway.  Cobian asked out Tina.  The NEXT FUCKIN' DAY AFTER I TELL TINA I HAVE TO MOVE ON, Cobian asks her out? Smell sumthin' fishy?!?!?! Cobian helped me come to that conclusion...after talking with him, I came to that conclusion. FUCKER!  It sure is fun bein' stabbed in the back.  I fuckin' help them anyway I can to try and get together.  I leave, the next FUCKIN' day, guess what happens? This is just too well timed to NOT be planned. FUCKYOUYOUASSFUCKINPIECEOFSHITEATINBUTTFUCKERCUNTRAGASSHOLE!  GODDAMNIT!  I've felt suicidal before...but this is the exact opposite.  I want to live on, but I want OTHERS to die....at my hands.  This is full-out homicidal.   Congratulations Cobian. fuck you.  Spense

      You people REALLY don't update enough....and that needs to change.  What else am I supposed to when I sit at home and I get bored?  Go outside? HA...I think NOT!  Day 1:good so far, only been awake for a little bit and haven't had any flashbacks...but rather good.  sorry...none of you really needed to see that.  So I don't really know why I put it there.....oh well.  Movin' on. Peace Out!  Spense

      \/\/007!  TODAY WAS TOTALLY THE BEST SHOPPING DAY OF MY LIFE!!!! Do I sound a little femmy?  maybe.  You would be too, if you just got a brand-spankin'-new  ZOOT SUIT !!! OH MY JEEBUS!  IT RULES!  I FEEL LIKE A BILLION BUCKS WHEN I PUT IT ON! minus bein' paper and green and havin' a bunch of dead presidents all over me. ew... and I got new kick-ass shoes, and a belt, and.....wow.  I sure do sound like a girl....shoot me.  Shoot me now. Then we went and ate at The Old Spaghetti Factory, which is an uber rock-awesome italian restaurant*DUH!* Then my Mom, Rick, and I went and saw The Village, which was a pretty good movie.  Kinda predictable though....and I don't think it has much re-view value, so...I'm gonna leave it at that. Then we came home and I'm sitting here watching Elimidate: Fabulous Over Fifty All I can say.......EW!  OH MY GOD I WANNA RIP MY EYES OUT!!!  D'ya know how wrong it is to see two fifty year olds doin' body shots?!?!?!  sick-o! hm......oh ya.  I've totally forgotten to talk about  THE DUNGEON .  It is the nickname for the room that I sleep in...in the basement of this house.  Plus, this house feels like a hobbit-hole, everything is like 4 feet tall.  I have to duck under almost every door, and a few ceilings. Everyone is havin' fun in RF...that's good.  Fun is good.  Tomorrow we're gonna go hikin' in the mountains and hang out with this really awesome missionary guy who returned from his mission: commonly referred to as RM's.  After seeing The RM...I'm not sure if I really look forward to that too much.(The RM is an LDS movie.)  Now that I'm watchin' The Drew Carey show, I totally forgot what I was gonna say....oh well.   Better for you guys anyway huh?  Peace! Spense

      I'm uh....not gonna let that ruin my day. I've been having a WONDERFUL day so far, sure I've only been awake for 1/2 an hour, but, gosh-darnit, I feel good. hm...it seems that this little incedent has affected WAY more people then it should've. If you are not directly involved, I wish for you to go to Brendan's blog and read his choice words of advice. I'm more pissed at myself now then any one else. I need breakfast.  Cinnamon Toast Crucnh sounds good.......Mmmmm*drool* oh ya, I leave for Utah in less than two days!  I don't wanna go, I'm gonna be really frickin' bored, meanwhile everyone's gonna be havin' fun back here in good ol' River Falls.  Dangit, I don't wanna go to Utah...I just wanna hang out with my friends. :-( Such is the price for being an ass hole.

      This is a post.  Not  ANY  post, it's a special post. If you have a guilty feeling in the bottom of your stomach, you will see, you will see terrible,  terrible  things written about you in this space:        I hope at least a  FEW  of you see sumthin' about you in there....because there are three  extra  special people that I hope see their names in there.  Have a nice name while I'm Utah.  Hope you have LOTS of fun hangin' out with each other while I'm not here.

      Why am I up this early?  Oh ya, stupid doctor's appointment.  I was dead asleep when my mom knocked loudly on the door this morning, and then I quickly got up and put on the first clothes I could find and sprinted out the door. *********************** I dislike being up this early, I really do.  'Cause now I have a very long time until people wake up, and then I become less bored.  I don't know how many people are goin' to be willing to hang out with me today however....after last night.  But, I'm not gonna get on that, because I'm just gonna forget about it.  oh..that's just great. nevermind.  I'm gonna go take a shower and mow the lawn now.  Good-Bye.

No one told us to stop.  Sumone could have. Sure, I felt  uber -bad about doing it at Ky's house in his living room.  Extreme happiness can do amazing things to reason.  All reason was gone.  What??  You people think I don't feel bad for Ky.  Sure I fuckin' do!  I know  exactly  what pain Ky is goin' through, but you people consider me heartless. I'm givin' a vote of confidence in the guy, it just happens to be in the cruedest way possible.  He can live through it, I know he can.  He's a big, strong guy, he can do this! fuck...I don't even know if it's worth it trying to stick up for myself and my reasoning.  You people don't give a damn anyway, you have pre-set opinions, and I'm not gonna change 'em.  Spense  P.S. Ky, if you ever read, this.  I'm sorry goddamnit!

      It's my dad's birthday today.  He turns 51, man that's old.  I bet you all really wanted to know that didn't you??  huh? huh?  >:-(  you jerks. I'm still pretty dazed after last night...I mean,  MAN  talk about a doozy.  I just "got done" mowing the lawn.  You're probably wondering why that's in quotations...but it is for a good reason.  Me being done mowing the lawn means, the lawmower that we're borrowing from Steve ran out of gas with a 1/4 of the lawn still long....:-S  ** EEP ** It took me a really long time to even get 3/4 of the lawn done, because I like cute little animals too much.  Everytime I saw a frog, I would stop the lawnmower and wait for it to move out of the way, not helping it move out of the way though....because that would make it weak and not be able to survive in the wilderness, and all his froggy friends would laugh at him because he was such a pussy.  Then he would grow up and have to go into froggy psychology!  That poor poor frog...  I think tonight I'm going to Harold and Kumar go to White Castle again...but I'm not sure, Jackie has to contact me and tell me if we still are or not.  Man, I sure do love Vindicated by Dashboard Confessional....you guys shoudl hear it if you haven't, and if you have, you should listen to it more...because without it, you are NOTHING!!!!  MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  I'm gonna go play sum DDR now....I love that game, I get such a rush from it.  I just go and play like 10 standards songs and 10 heavy songs...and by that time I'm all gross and sweaty, but....I feel better after doing it.  Then I go take a shower and read my  BATHROOM READER .  Oh ya, that whole goin' and playin' DDR thing....I should get on that. BREAKFAST?!?! BAH!  Who needs breakfast!  Spense

      So....I don't know what to feel at this very moment.  I just found out sum pretty interesting stuff....stuff that makes me both happy and depressed at the same time. the fact that sumone loves me, and I love them. But.....we can't have each other.  I had a pretty good day up until a certain point, where my dad got home. He basically called me a lazy bum and said that I haven't "done a damn thing all summer." Then he asked me when the next ACT dates were, and I said April....then he said that I had to register for college by November, and apparently, because I can't take them fast enough...I'm not goin' to college next year anymore. stupid dad. I can still go for one semester.  Now I'm just gettin' angry, because my friends are talkin' about me behind my back...not necessarily bad things, just things they think are true....but aren't.  ARG! indeed. I don't know what to do with my life. If you have an idea....you can either: 1.)tell me, but only if it is beneficial..or a good idea, or 2.)cram it up your ass. Who do you think you are trying to control me?!?!?!?  Spense   **Everything below this line was added 15 minutes later.**  I forgot to mention the Awesomest part of my day! When I came home from Steve's house this afternoon, I found that my beaver lawn ornament thingymajigger, was moved. It was sitting in front of my door with a large piece of paper firmly planted under it. I picked up the piece of paper and went inside and read it and looked at the beautiful pictures. XP It was of course, from Molly and Kathleen, it was their own way of saying, "we care for you Spenser, and you're a stud...who likes baggy pants! There are PLENTY of fish in the sea. :-D" Ya...so...that was awesome...then the worst part of my day just happened...even worse then my dad telling me that I'm worthless. I have hurt so many people lately. Unfotunately a few of them have been on my own accord, meanwhile a few of them haven't....and boy do I feel like shit.  I'm not gonna go into detail. I'm not sure the participents would be happy if I were to mention them.  Peace, Love, Valvoline!  Spense......again.  **everything below this line was added another 15 minutes later**  My life doesn't seem so bad anymore. Love really does make the world turn. Peace Out everyone, and sleep well tonight.  Spense

      Everyone is comin' home soon..and that's kool.  Except for one tiny little fact...  I LEAVE FOR UTAH NEXT MONDAY!  Good timing huh?  That's alright, all you returning people probably don't wanna hang out with me anyway...*pity moment*  Well...glad that's over.  hm..what to talk about?  THE PERFECT SCORE:  great, GREAT movie.  Possibly just as awesome as....  Harold and Kumar go to White Castle: Another really awesome movie, really frickin' funny...but have a few extra bucks on ya....'cause you're gonna wanna eat White Castle afterwards....let me tell you. It was awesome,  Steve, Kyle, and I went to that movie...then when it was done we all wanted White Castle REALLY REALLY BAD!  So we went outside, got in the car, and asked this group of people where the nearest White Castle was.  Then we went there and ate....and it was pretty good.  Dispite the fact that I  hate White Castle.   There was one thing that the Perfect Score had that Harold and Kumar didn't.   Scarlett Johansson:  the uberly hott gothic punk chick from the Perfect Score.  Oh my JEEBUS...I can't get over it......damn.  Hm....what else...........I dunno. The only reason I'm updating this is because I was threatened with Potatoing if I didn't....:-S  Otherwise I porbably woulda left that other post, just to see ho many posts I could get......n'stuff.  Thursday, at like 11...Tascha, Gloria, Ky, and I went swimming...it was kool.  It's really hard to swim with huge baggy pants on....so I ditched them at one point...then felt really uncomfortable...so I went and got them back.  I'm such a douche fuck.  It's ok....I still like me. hm....what else happened?  I dunno.. I hafta eat lunch and take a shower now though :-D  ugh ugh...Spenser stinky.  *belches*  This Caveman Minute has been brought to you by:  Our Family Mini Beef Ravioli in Tomato & Meat Sauce.  Our family, quality everything since 1904. :-D  *cheesy smile* Alright...I really do need to eat and shower though....Peace Out!  Spense  P.S. If anyone is doin' anythin' today or tonight...or anytime in the near future.  Call me..because I'm a sad little human guy who needs constant companionship to stop him from flippin' out and killin' people  urlLink  www.pwned.nl   style. K?
