      This week, I will mostly be researching: Mobile/wireless support costs (Computer Weekly) Federated identity management (Information Age) I am seeking both vendor spokespeople and case studies for these features. My thanks to Jackie D for her help in sorting out my time/date settings conundrum. Any foodies among you should definitely visit  urlLink Jackie's blog , but possibly not if already hungry!

      ... my date and time settings are all to cock. But I'll be jiggered if I can fix it. Bear with me (and let me know what I'm doing wrong if poss!)

      Aagghh! Addictive personality means that mindless blogging is now right up there with the rest of my less appealing traits: smoking, drinking too much, talking too loudly, persistent procrastination. Yesterday, I managed to demonstrate all of these, sometimes concurrently. And you can see the photographic evidence  urlLink here . I am the one in the turquoise scarf. Thanks to the guys at the  urlLink Big Blog Company  for making it all possible - and with so much good grace, too.

      ...everyone, yes I mean  everyone,  should read what are known between myself, the lovely Jo Faragher and the equally lovely Duncan Robertson as The Botswana Books. And this article from today's  Independent  does a cracking job of  urlLink telling you why .

      These are early blogging days for me, so be patient! I'll hopefully have this blog fully up and running early next week. Even so, I expect keeping it to be no more than a "part-time, voluntary, solipsistic activity", to quote recent University of Toronto research into blogging. Let's face it, I'm cynical on two fronts: a) Do I have the discipline to post regularly? b) Does it matter anyway? But I'm willing to give it a try... In the meantime, my search for interesting writing work continues... Sent pitch today for a story on Dubai Internet City to  The Guardian  and  The Telegraph .  urlLink Dubai Internet City  is a Middle East base for some of the world's largest and most influential high-tech companies, including Microsoft, Oracle, HP, IBM, Compaq, Dell, Siemens, Canon, Logica, Sony Ericcson and Cisco (to name just a few) and offers these companies "100% tax-free ownership and 100% repatriation of capital and profits with no currency restrictions". Most people, by contrast, only know about it as a holiday resort for footballer's wives. It is, of course, also home to the admirable Jacqui Pye (one of my personal favourites) and her partner Sean. I seek contacts for potential commissions, or, even better, commissions. Will let you know how I fare...
