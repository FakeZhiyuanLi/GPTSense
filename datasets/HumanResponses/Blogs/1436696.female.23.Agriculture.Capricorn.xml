      احمقانه است که من اینجا نشستم و میخوام بنویسم ولی تنها چیزی که تو ذهنم چرخ میخوره اینه که خسته ام و دیگر هیچ.... قاعدتا سال جدید باید پر از تغییر باشه ولی روزهای من همون طوریه که بود... خواب خواب و خواب.... همش همین و روزهایی که کش میان و تموم نمیشن یا اگه یه جور دیگه نگاشون کنی انقدر سریع رد میشن که وقت نمیکنم بفهمم یه روز جدید شروع شده.... راستی امروز چندمه؟ اول؛ دوم؛ بیستم؟ شایدم فروردین تموم شده باشه.... چه فرقی میکنه؟ امروزم یه روزه مثل روزهای دیگه و منم یه آدمم مثل آدمهای دیگه و هیچ وقت هیچ اتفاقی نمیوفته....  Well, nothing ever happens round here  خب دیگه اینم از این... راستی فعلا حس وحال نوشتن ندارم تا بعد! سال نیکی داشته باشین و قلبهاتون بهار باشه....

      بعضی روزها فقط میخوام که دستم رو بلند کنم و خورشید رو از کنار بکشم.... بعضی شبها دلم میگه که برم رو تراس و با قلموم روی تاریکی ستاره های نقره ای بکشم.... اما چیزی که مهمه اینه که وقتی کارم تموم میشه باید کسی رو پیدا کنم که باورم کنه. تازه آخرشم همیشه میبینم که آسمون همون طوری که بود خوشگل تره...

      بی مزه و لوس! ایتالیا که خوب بازی میکنه میبازه! اون وقت این آلمان با این وضعش... ای بابا! سوئد که وقت کرد باید فروشگاه شانس فروشی باز کنه..... بگذریم... حال شما؟  بنده کمی تا قسمتی در حال و هوای سردگمی به سر میبرم... اول بگم: کار یافتیدم! یعنی گمونم کار من رو یافتید... حالا چه فرقی میکنه! خلاصه که الان یه مدتیه دارم دوره TTC میگذرونم و اگه خدا بخواد از هفته دیگه teacher میشم! هه هه هه هه هه هه!!!! هنوز میدونم که آیا این حق رو دارم که به صرف دونستن چند کلوم انگلیسی لیاقت دارم به کسی درس بدم یا نه؟ شاه مردان علی یه جمله داره که... "هر کس کلامی به من آموخت مرا بنده خود ساخته" نمیدونم چرا این جمله اینقدر من رو میترسونه از مسؤلیتی که میخوام بعده بگیرم... اگه یه وقت یه جایی به کسی یه کلمه اشتباه یاد بدم چی؟ از طرف دیگه یه چند روزی دچار آهنگ When The Wrong One Loves You Right شدم از اآلبوم New Day که Celine Dion خوندتش...  Don't care, what they think  How they feel, or what they say  You're everything, I never knew  I always wanted, baby  I've been warned, so many times  They tell me I've ignored the signs  But nobody knows you like I do  The only one for me is you  I can't stop, can't fight, can't resist it  When the wrong one loves you right  (Oh-oh-oh-oh-yeah)  Can't run - can't hide - can't say no  When the wrong ones loves you right  (Oh-oh-oh oh)  When the wrong ones loves you right  Getting tired, of hearing that  You're dangerous, but they won't stop  Until I leave, they won't believe  That being with you won't break my heart  So worried 'bout, the road ahead  They can't see that, you're my best friend  They're never gonna take me away from you  There's nothing they can do  I can't stop, can't fight, can't resist it  When the wrong one loves you right  (Oh-oh-oh-oh-yeah)  Can't run - can't hide - can't say no  When the wrong ones loves you right  (Oh-oh-oh oh)  When the wrong ones loves you right  How can I walk away  When the feeling's so strong  I know you're where I belong  They say I let my heart  Make up my mind  That's why I'll never say goodbye  I can't stop, can't fight, can't resist it  When the wrong one loves you right  (Oh-oh-oh-oh-yeah)  Can't run - can't hide - can't say no  When the wrong ones loves you right  (Oh-oh-oh oh)  When the wrong ones loves you right  I can't stop, can't fight, can't resist it  When the wrong one loves you right  (Oh-oh-oh-oh-yeah)  Can't run - can't hide - can't say no  When the wrong ones loves you right  (Oh-oh-oh oh)  When the wrong ones loves you right واقعا ها... اگه یه کس آشتباه آدم رو درست دوست داسته باشه... نه میشه فرار کرد نه میشه جنگید نه میشه قایم شد نه میشه... فقط میشه تسلیم شد! اما یه چیز دیگه که فکرم رو مشغول کرده اینه که: What if the right one loves you wrong? What if you know the person is right & you are sure he loves you but there would be no way you tow get together? Or visa versa... he loves you & he is the mighty Mr. Right yet you don’t love him back? چه میدونم دیگه....

      ای بابا... بعد میگن چرا قلبت با باتری کار میکنه... ده خوب اگه به خودش بود سر مسابقه انگلیس-فرانسه و علی الخصوص تواین دو دقیقه آخر که واستاده بود که!  چی بگم آخه... این پنالتی رو خدا از رو زمین بر داره که من سکته نکنم... اول که این دیوید بکهام پنالتی رو خراب میکنه بعد زیدان صاف توپ رو میزنه تو چارچوب... از این لجم میگیره که فرانسه اصلا خوب بازی نکرده بود (هرچند که من طرفدارشم ولی خداییش بد بازی کرد دیگه) خلاصه که من حو صله موصله ندارم........ یا ایتالیا امشب درست بازی میکنه یا من خودم میکشمشون.... میدونین که ایتالیایی ها مثل ما نیستن که تیم ببازه برن استقبال و به به و چه چه راه بندازن؛ همچین "استقبالی" با گوجه و تخم مرغ گندیده و... میکنن از تیم که! دفعه پیش یادتونه تو جام جهانی؟ تیم یواشکی برگشت ایتالیا که ازش استقبال نکن! همینه که فوتبالشون پیش میره دیگه. *نکته: این متن رو قبل بازی ایتالیا-دانمارک مینویسم ها.* -----------------    بازی ایتالیا رو که بیخیال با این پاسکاری احمقانه شون! من نمیدونم این همه مهره... یکی یه گل نمیتونست بزنه؟ کریستسن ویری که خونش مباحه... هر چند ز حق نگذریم نستا مثل همیشه عالی بود! و بازی هم ای بدک نبود... اما... عجب بازی بود این بازی بلغار و سوئد! کیفولی شدم شدید. اولش فکر میکردم که شاید بلغار و سوئد مساوی کنند اما واقعا که سوئد غوغا کرد... بعد گل دوم که یه دفعه و ناگهانی سومین گل رو زدن دیگه روحیه بلغاریها بهم ریخت. دلم براشون سوخت... آخر حرکت تیمی بودن واقعا... من کلا از تیمهایی که خوب پاسکاری میکنن بیشتر از تیمهایی که خوب گل میزنن خوشم میاد و وقتی فوتبال نگاه میکنم به پاس صحیح بیشتر دقت میکنم. این بلغاریها انگار جای همدیگه رو توی زمین با سانت مشخص میکردن. بخصوص از پاسهای پشت پاشون خوشم اومد و یک-دو هاشون. حیف که گل نزدن.... ایتالیا بدبخته امسال... بس که گفتن قرعه خوبی اورده اینجوری شد ها!  حالا ببینیم امشب هلند با آلمان چه میکنه...!

      چند روزیه که داستان قدیمی رو بازسازی میکنم و کلی درگیر شخصیتهاش شدم. فقط بدیش اینه که شخصیتهام طبق معمول راه خودشون رو میرن و به حرف من گوش نمیکنن.... مثلا از یه شخصیت انتظار دارم که ننر و بیمزه باشه اما تنها کاری که نمیکنه ننر بازی در اوردن... لوس! بگذریم چقدر هوا گرم شده! من دارم اینجا میپزم.... هرچی لباس خنک داشتم گذاشتم دم دست و میپوشمشون اما افاقه نمیکنه که نمیکنه! ای بابا! جمعه میرم کرج... آقای پسر عمه عزیز آقای پدر گرامی برای تولد دخترشون همه رو دعوت کردن.... ای وای ولی باید این کوچولو رو میدیدن پاهاش از یه بند انگشت بیشتر نبود... وای اینقدر کوچولو بود که نگو.... تا حالا من از همه نوزادهای فامیل کوچولو موچولوتر بودم اما این دخترک از من موچوله تره! از یه چیزی که تو این ماجرا خوشم اومده هیجانزدگی پسرعمه ام هست... آخه همش دارن قند تو دلش آب میکنن... وقتی زنگ زده بود که دعوتمون کنه کلی سر به سر فابی گذاشت و آخرش بهش گفت من بابای "آرمید"م.... خوشتون اومد؟

       مسخره نیست که وقتی تصمیم گرفتم که دیگه ننویسم یک دفعه این همه موضوع برای نوشتن پیدا شده؟ ناهید که از جلوی خورشید میگذره و افسانه میگه تنها باریه که آناهیتا و میترا باهم متحد میشن.... و اینهمه dream که کم کم خودشون رو میرسونن روی موج و به من چشمک میزنن و .... با موج غیب میشن. و نمیدونم......... حالام که دچار بیماری Schizophrenic آلبوم جدید JC شدم! بخصوص این آهنگ lose myselfش که دیگه شاهکاره! و وای mercy رو هم دوست میدارم........ ولی کلا امروز روز خوبی بود...... میل سینا خیلی شارژم کرد.  Isn't it strange? How life can take you up right after you feel you are drowned & there is no savor out there?

      I really need to get this out of my head.... right now I hate everybody. I hate myself for getting into nasty fights when I know nobody’s listening to me. I hate my sister because all she is, is trouble. She already messed up my life too much to be ignored. She thinks she is old enough to meddle with my life. She absolutely thinks (for she is taller than me) she can rule my life. & she always ignores the fact that she is 6 for crying out loud 6 years younger tan me. & damn it’s all because of her stupid ego center head that I can not get connected from home! I’m mad at my mother who thinks that I need to keep my privileges from my sister so she won’t think they prefer me! & the funny point is that it’s she who always gets what she wants not me. I’m sick of being treated like I have the responsibility of other’s actions. I’m sick of my parents telling me when to go home & where to go. I’m fed up with the fact that my dad can not see that his behavior had made my sister so blunt.  I really don’t think that I can much more of it. I really need some air to breathe. I’m not 16 for God's sake. I don’t understand these stupid limits I’m living with.  I need a job & I need to get away from the whole family for a while or forever that doesn’t mater now to me. I never thought I would find myself here.... nothing seems right. Damn I had been drifting away from my family for the past 6 months I barely spoke to my father. Rarely listened to my mom & the funny point is they never asked what was wrong! They didn’t even seem to notice. Sometimes I wonder what will happen when I die one day not far from now. They will have a big funeral & my mm will cry a lot & my dad will look dull for a while both few months later they wont even remember my name. & my sister will have everything she wants....  I hate them! No I don’t! I really don’t have any feelings toward them & that’s worst than what it seems. I could care less if they feel alright or not. It doesn’t bother me what they think about anything anymore; they are most likely wrong anyhow. Why should I care?

      پنجشنبه توی یه جمعی بحث شرافت و انسان بودن در گرفت... من معتقدم که شرافت مثل زیبایی یک مفهوم آبستره است یعنی دارای مفهوم مطلقی نیست و ظروف مکانی و زمانی متفاوت بسته به فرهنگ و فرد تعریف متفاوتی داره.  بحثی که پیش اومد این بود که آیا این کلمات آبستره دارای ماهیت مطلق (absolute)  هستن و هر کس برداشت خاصی از این ماهیت مطلق داره {یعنی این مفاهیم ذاتی فطرت انسانی هستن با نمود های متفاوت} یا اینکه اصولا برای هر فرد بصورت شخصی (individual) تعریف میشوند؟  از طرف دیگه این مسئله که آیا شرافت آبستره هست یا نیست هم وجود داره... مفاهیم آبستره دامنه گسترده ای رو پوشش میدن. مثلا عشق یا خوشبختی... خوشبختی برای من میتونه یه عروسک پشت ویترین باشه و برای کس دیگه ای تأمین مالی همه انسانها... اما در عین حال میتونه یه خوشبختی نهایی definite وجود داشته باشه که همه اینها تصاویر (images) از اون باشن.  عشق و زیبایی هردو مفاهیم بسیار فردی هستن... شاید شخصیترین تعاریف رو داشته باشن... من ایمان دارم هیچکس مانند دیگری عشق نمیورزه و اگه کسی بگه که میفهمه چون عاشق بوده دروغ گفته! اما در عین حال این واقعیت هم هست که جایی در ناخودآگاه ما دوست داشتن زندگی میکنه و زیبایی با وجود اینهمه دیدگاه گوناگون باید در جایی به نهایت خودش برسه... یه سوأل دیگه اینه که آیا مفهومی اکثریت از یه کلمه آبستره برداشت میکنن درسته یا نه... یعنی آیا اساسا میشه شرافت رو با وجدان جمعی تعریف کرد و یا نمیشه؟ (که تازه همین وجدان جمعی؛ اخلاقیات؛ moral sense یا هرچی میخوایم اسمش رو بذاریم از جامعه ای به جامعه دیگه، از فرهنگی به فرهنگ دیگه و از یک دوره زمانی به دوره دیگه فرق میکنه) خب لطفا اگه میتونین با کلمات ساده جواب من رو بدین آخه فیلسوفم یه چند مدتیه که رفته مرخصی!!!!!!!!!

      The next one in the band is lollypop (23). He is well sort of a doormat or better to say naive, although he is sweet & well-shaped but you never think he is like others. Sometimes he surprises you by being so forthcoming, but usually he’s rather shy & blushes on when he talks to people (especially girls) he doesn’t know… I can’t see why others ignore him; he could turn into a very hearty boy if you give him the chance… besides he tries to be amiable & caring. The very excellent point in him is his politeness; he knows where the limits are….  The very next is Mooshi; she is a good looking, nice girl, only 5 days younger than me! She is mild-tempered & a fix member for going out & having fun. Being frank & keeping secrets are of her virtues. (Doesn’t it turn a bit literate?) Mooshi keeps her pains to herself & shares her joys….  Miss Petit (22) is Mooshi’s friend & of course ours. She is a fragile good looking pretty girl. You feel like she is so vulnerable that you have to protect her. However she is very strong, though a rather irritable & dismayed. My dearest Miss Petit is timid, humble & conscientious which I like most in her. There is something about her that makes everybody like her.   Mr. President is another guy in the band. He is younger than us but he always acts as he is years older, & wiser…. God knows he keeps a cool head in arguments & one may rely on him to be gentle & tactful. He is gallant & well-balanced I dare say & cares a lot about his look. (He knows what to wear & how to dress.) The matter is that he knows it all… so you name it he is rather bigheaded & he shows it…. Any way you feel like talking to him sometime about politics, literature & etc. ‘cos he is so knowledgeable. (Damn my pride we can’t sit on table without argument….) well, I forgot to tell you how moody he is, you never can predict what’s up with him….  There are others in the band, but I’ll tell you about them as I go on.

      I talked about the band before, & I guess it¡¦s time to introduce members of the band¡K The first for sure is Ava, a 23- year-old, handsome perfect girl. She is the soul of the band; I mean she is the heart & the brain. Others call us Ava's bunch of friends, that's what it is. Ava is rather a tall girl (not so tall!); she's got dark hair & dark brown eyes which sparkles when she talks¡K. & her voice is like velvet. You see how easy is falling for her! & that's not all! She's got the look & sure the brain, too. Her logical way of looking at the matter & her self-confidence makes her the first choice to turn to when there is something up. She knows how to act in every situation. Whatever comes by, she has the ability to deal with. These qualifications make her a trustworthy, beloved friend. If you need to talk to someone, well she is out there to help & cheer you up. She is a day-dreamer I can say (I daydream, too, so we go with each other). But sometimes it gets her in trouble as she processes happenings in her mind which often result in finding new things which may turn the situation upside down! (She is like that just when she is involved in; she seems to have a tendency to find terrible hints about herself.) But she is wise & great! The Poetess is the next! She is a beauty; she is rich, handsome, with grayish green eyes! you name it, she has it all! Besides she is a poetess! People tend to fall in love with her; one look & they're in forever! She is younger than us (22) & so we spoil her a bit. She is rather emotional, tender-hearted I dare say. She acts sentimentally & it gets you sometime but its ok! the poetess is lovely, loving & giving. (Doesn't it rhyme as her poems?) She sure is generous, well-read & dignified, although she can turn to a stubborn, touchy person when she is not in mood.  She is a helping hand when you need one & is willing to do anything for friendship. I wish she wasn't moody & that she wouldn't believe in everything easily. To tell ya the truth sometimes I feel like holding her & keeping her safe forever although she doesn't like it! Mat(23) is cute guy. He has handsome face, hazel brown eyes (with a shining laughter), & a very small nose which I adore. He is really reliable, protective, clever, & sincere. Tell you some secret? You may call him in the middle of the night for help & he¡¦d be right away! Even though he is an astute but he tend to ignore hints about himself. Mat is really firm-minded & there are times when goes on repeating the same thing without even caring for advices! He's got his own way of life. Being ambitious, he is focused & goal-oriented! God knows, how I envy him for that. Well, he could be somewhat gutsy, so don't play dare-devil with him!!! Another good point of being his friend is that he really cares about everything, like he has to take care of everyone of us! & something else if you want a job done without a word, he is a good choice! At last he has a clear mind & romance doesn't appeal to him very much. (Maybe I'm wrong!) Pat (23) is our dark guy. He's got beautiful gray eyes that change color with his suits & much prettier hands! Like he has them made by a stylish artist. He keeps a cool head about everything; he can tell you jokes that make you laugh your heart out without even a smile on his face. Nothing is expressed on his face like he wears a stone mask on. One can't guess what he thinks of! We sometimes wonder whether he likes us or what. We like him very much; he is a charmer & if you're down, he can make your day. Although he acts reserved sometimes, but he shows tenderness & gives protection whenever it is needed. He announced that he is prejudiced! & that we may not talk to guys from other fractions ;) (He is the coolest liar I've ever met.) Oh, I forgot! Pat & Mat are close friends! (Remember the cartoon?)  The last but not the least for today is Teddy. He is a bit overweight but you must see the face! God did a perfect job creating that. I really like his face rounded with everything as it should be. He is the richest in the group. He is easy-going & honest. When we met the first time, I feel I knew him from somewhere! He is a bit naughty & you feel he plays all the time; pulling everyone's leg. However when it comes to real matters, you can always turn to him for advice! And he is the oldest in the band, he turned 24 this May. Ok! Folks enough now. I introduced the main ones in the band others could wait for next time!

      Well Iâ€™ve told ya before! I am a 23-year-old girl from heart of Tehran. I study in food engineering major. (Guess what? I am more than enough plump!) Itâ€™s my last term in school & it means that I donâ€™t have enough time to have fun!!!! But I do find it interesting to write about our band! Something else, names are not real in this weblog due to privacy matters. However I try to jet down real things about life of tehranian kidsâ€¦ My family consists of one great mom, one cool dad & a lovely tall younger sisterâ€¦ I think we are happy as far as I can sayâ€¦ But the BAND! Well, we are letâ€™s say 3 to 6 girls (people come in & go out but there are 3 girls fixed.) & 2 to 6 boys (sorry pals, we take the lead here.) the band keeps company in school, picnics, cafes & etc. there is something that makes us different from other bands over hereâ€¦ we have some self limits, some rules that we obey. Itâ€™s not written or never mentioned but everybody go through itâ€¦ for example we avoid getting involved too much in each otherâ€™s private affairs; or no one takes boyfriend or girlfriend with them.( although we are cool about thatâ€¦) & anyone knows what offends others so behaves morally. None of us smokes & if any body does they donâ€™t show itâ€¦with the band you can always find help in the corner. They know how to cheer you up, how to make your day. & the band shares your pain & laughter. You find support, love & friendship; like weâ€™re a familyâ€¦ Ok! Enough now! Iâ€™ll go on laterâ€¦

        So what a girl does in Iran?  I think living in Tehran is like living in ant other countries. You can go out with your friends, watch movies in theaters, and hear music in concerts. One may think people don’t have enough freedom here in Tehran, but the point is we enjoy this much that we have. Although, wearing scarf is a bit hard for some ladies, at the same time it gives you the choice to make new fashion! It’s not that I’m totally satisfied with my life. There are limits to what I can do: when going out, we must take great care not to be caught by some police forces, or as a girl I can’t go traveling around the country alone (because police mat think I run away from home!) ; but living here is fun… I have good friends; boys & girls, we’re classmates in university. A lot of fun is waiting for us, going to mountain climbing, movies… & of course we study, not as hard as students in other countries but all of us are top students.

      Who am I? Well, I am a 23-year old girl, a food engineering student (to tell you the truth, I’m a senior), more than a bit plump & a casual girl like everybody else. I live in heart of Tehran with my parents & my sister. Is that enough?

      It’s what I was thinking about last few days. I was decided not to write about politics; though it’s every Iranian’s second job. There is saying that says if tow Iranian gets together, there would be a political party; the third one who comes along will form a fraction!   The point is true somehow: talking about politics is a hobby over here. I was wondering if freedom means what others mention. Others who moved out of Iran & just try to show deficiencies of the country but they really don’t have the cure as we say. What do they know about living here? …25 years ago people was sure what they didn’t want, not knowing what they do want. So when some one with charisma like AYATOLAH KHOMEINI came along, they vote for him & this is the result. Once again unfortunately we face the same thing people don’t want this régime. They want freedom (of what?) but I gathered they’re not thinking of what they want next! Communism, monarchism or what… I know there are others but who really will rule this country? To me freedom is not wearing what I want, it’s not dancing & sure it’s not f***ing around as some people say. Freedom means I can choose my way of living; think what I want to think & speak it out as anyone else does. Freedom to me is the right to select what I guess is right not what others do.   I’m concerned about what is going to happen here. We experienced a revolution & we’re still paying for it. My generation has been sacrificed even before we were borne & I don’t want my children (if I have one) to feel their life ruined. I don’t think Iran is ready to have another revolution! & you can call me coward for saying that but I’m afraid of the revolution, the bloodshed & I don’t like wars. I want to live peacefully the rest of my life. Is it so much to ask?  I promise it would be last time I would write about politics! It’s because of the demonstration thing that I jot down my thoughts.   Something else, I believe in freedom & democracy. & I believe some day we will have them but this day is yet to come till we all understand what we really yearn for not what others want us to desire!

      I'm turning 24! Can you believe it? I always consider myself as some 16 year old & now that I'm facing adulthood I can't say I really like it.  Tonight I'm going to dream of the way I want to be & tomorrow I will wake up to face my 23rd birthday & start the 24th year. & I'm trying to avoid any kind of parties. I want to spend tomorrow in complete peace.... Alright I can't quite avoid it! My aunt will drop by tomorrow & I will be out to have launch with Katrine. & there will be the cake & birthday traditionsâ€¦ except for the gifts which I don't like. What are birthday traditions?

      I'm fine & most of people over here in Tehran didn't feel even a shake but we are all shocked & things are a bit hectic here.  It was announced that 70% of the city had been destroyed & over 20000 lives are missing. The phone lines are disconnected & the electricity & water supplies are limited.  The rescue committee is biased in Kerman the nearest large city & 5 states around Bam & Jiroft are in stand-by state to help. Blood of all type, food and blankets are needed.  I've head that donations are enough to settle the victims for the night... I can't donate blood cos I got vaccinated in the past month & when I contact Red Cross, I've been told that volunteers' help in long distance is not needed right now cos it's impossible to send us over there & that we would be more trouble than help (not this much impolite of course!) the lady in charge was very nice though!   As you may heard the largest brick-building in the world, Arg-e-bam (castle of Bam) had been damaged completely! It has been one of the few sightseeing I never got the chance to visit. My family was planning to travel there in spring holidays; but I guess now we must plan on somewhere else.   Alright; I'll keep you informed if anything new happened but meanwhile I think I must thank Turkish government for they had been the first to offer their help.

      So what is all about? I mean, come on, why can't people wear what they want where they want? It's rather strange that in a country known for the freedom, Hejaab is forbidden! I thought freedom means the government doesn't interfere with people's private lives. & religion, in my humble opinion of course, is personal.  How do you behave if government forbid going to churches? Or announce that you shall not wear cross around your neck? Wearing veils are as simple as that. Although I, myself, don't wear them as Islam says, but still there are ladies who believe in that... & it's insulting to them  their belief is  [how may I put this]  not accepted . What's the difference between Taliban & French government anyway? Both of them oblige ladies to wear what (some of them) don't want to. How may a scarf offend anyone anyway? Wearing it or not, it's just the matter of belief & taste.  One friend told me  it's just the majority doesn't want women to wear Hejaab ! Well, maybe the majority wants them to wear it in Afghanistan so what was all the mess about women's right there? If we've got the right to wear anything we like then why scarf is banned? & if there are limits to it, whereas not to offend majority, so why it's only for so-called privileged developed countries?  It has been just my personal point of view... It doesn't mean I support Taliban or any other government (as Iran's) who force Hejaab. Obligation in any case is considered wicked in my opinion, whether it be wearing or not wearing what you want.

      Wow, it's yalda night at last! Tonight we're going through the tradition of passing the night... What is yalda night? Well, yalda is the longest winter night at 1st of Day, The longest night of year. Thee are some myths associated with this night but it's not my place to write about them... actually some of mythologists believe that Christmas is sort of derived  from yalda &  Mitra  (God of Mehr & sun) myths & celebration. I am trying to find some sources & put the link here so you may know more about it! Meanwhile I can tell you the story I was told about it & my family tradition.... When we were young we used to listen to the story of how light fights evil through this longest night & how she wins & by the end of the night she walks back to earth.... It's been said that by keeping fire alive & lighting our houses we help light to fight & then find her way back to us! The lights are not supposed to go out all through the night & if there is fire place the fire must burn all night long. & most people tend to stay up till very late & chat... I guess this night is eating-what-you-want-night! You know folks sit by the fire & while chatting, spend the night eating all kind of snacks! The first one to mention is Ajil-e-moshekgosha! This is kind of nuts which has some sweets along & it's very delicious! Folks eat them & think of their problems & they believe that the problem will be solved somehow.... It's a good thing to cheer up. I mean you think bitter but taste sweet & it reminds you that there is still sweetness & happiness around the corner. Watermelons & pomegranates are very popular for eating during this night! I don't know why we have this RED fruits but there should be some kind of red fruit on the table for this night. Frozen fruits like cherries & strawberries are also very appealing. How do I love this night, just sitting there, eating snacks & listening to stories! Enough from the eating part! Yalda is not all about eating! One of the main traditions of the night is reading Hafez!  Fal gerftan  as we call it. you light the candles & say a little prayer for Hafez soul & you ask him what would be your future & then open the book & read the first poem on the right side... You'll probably find it amazing that he actually hints about what you asked!  Yalda is what I call a family gathering. Most of the time folks gather in some older family member & stay there till 2-3 in the morning.... Somehow thanksgiving may be compared to yalda on this account. No one stays alone in this night.... This is a night to be thankful for loving & being loved.... Guess what? I have to go make some snacks ready for the night....  Enjoy your yalda  this is a  urlLink cool link  for knowing more about yalda.

      Wow; you can't imagine hoe happy Iranians are! It's like fairy tales when the evil die...  You know over the past 23 years, he has been one of the most hated men in my country. Most people tend to think of him as the cause of Iran- Iraq war; the imposed war that killed our nation's children & enforce economical crisis on our country. & there are people over here who curse him for being indecorous toward holy-places like Karbala & Najaf.   I don't know how I feel about him.... Well, for sure he had been a dictator & so many had been hurt during his time & he on top of all brought misery & heartache to my nation. Yet when I was watching him with his family & then the time he was arrested, I felt sorry for him. The man who is arrested, in my eyes, is not the vindictive cruel dictator; he was an old insulted man who had lost everything in the world: his power, his family & most of all his respect. When he was examined  like beasts , I thought that was the worst punishment for a ruler...& that's what he himself causes: heartache & pain! Let him taste what he baked! Death is better than disrespect! But who is to blame but himself? He made his bed & he must lie in it!  Most westerns don't understand the joy Iraq feels about this... I watched Bailer & Bush talked about the capture! what do they know about his brutality toward Iraqis? &  IN THE NAME OF GOD  why American military stays over here? Weapons had not been found yet & Saddam is captured... Now it's time to let Iraq decide for herself!  Another political post.... Oopss! I forgot this blog is about my own life not politics but you know what? Politic is every Iranian's second job!

      So at last winter is here! Officially winter starts on 22 December which is the first of Day (the first month of Persian winter), but today Tehran is white covered by snow….  Winters… the time to make stories, time to feel easygoing & time to be a fairy in real life! This is how I see winters, nice & slow like romance & wild & unpredictable like isolated islands at the same time. It’s got the wisdom of a mature aged leader & yet mischievous laughter of a 5-year-old. It’s young as snow & old as time. I always wonder how it could be so complicated & simple simultaneously….   Right now I’m sitting by the window, looking over the city I love so much.  A blanket of snow covers Tehran’s body. It covers viciousness & gloom & leaves the city pure & virgin.  It seems to cast away all differences… there is only one color White, silver, or what you may call it… nothing but spotless clarity.  Winters holds some kind of a feminine character if you know what I mean. In Persian myths, winter fairy in an old woman. But I love to consider the winter goddess as young beautiful fairy, dressed in white robe… with jasmines in her hair. She passes by & spreads silver flakes of snow… or simply she sits by fireplace narrating tales which never ends.   This season is sort of family season too. Over here in Iran we sit around the living room & safe in the security & warmth of houses we spent long winter nights together. Folks tend to spend more time at home & stay close to the one they love. It sounds winter bonds us all together….  Children love this season! Schools would be closed after heavy snows & kids just go out to play, make snowmen & enjoy their unexpected day off! As a kid I used to pray for heavy snow… not that I didn’t loved the school but the temptation of staying in my bed under comforter & watch snowflakes melt hitting my window was so strong; it would erase the school from my mind!   I must declare I’m still praying for snow…. & still I spend most part of the morning (if I would be free) in my bed, watching white flakes, sipping my cup of tea & daydreaming! Alright I guess I never stop the daydreaming part…. What else I do in winter? Hum? I play with snow…. I gathered winters bring the child inside of me back! Sometimes I just put on my warm overcoat & grab umbrella to go for a walk, the best thing you can do in heavy traffic. It’s amazing to watch people hurrying around, trying to get home as soon as possible.   Wow, enough for now! I will write about winter costumes in Iran next time… till then enjoy your winter….

      It rained non-stop last week & I absolutely loved it! Like winter is tiptoeing to the city…. Rain & snow & wow it got rather cold. But this week again it’s sunny & warm, almost 15`c. yet it wont stop me from writing about winter next time & SHAB-E-YALDA costumes!  Believe me I figured I’m falling in love with every single season in Tehran over & over again! Remind me to tell you about winter hang outs; ski; snow; & for sure late night winter stories…. Christmas? New Year? Maybe I find some friends who write about them over here….

      Guess I never talked about my CLC (Conversation Language course) English classes. Wow we had a really nice gang there & I was the youngest. (Alright there was just one person younger than me!) I loooooovvvvved being pampered by them! Joking! But really we understand each other & despite the age gap we got along very well. I used to nickname my friends… names like “p the pampering”; “B the beautiful” & even “A – anti-woman” or …. (I used to be   Philanthropic  !)  After 2 years, we still meet each other sometimes specially with one of my best friends P-the-pampering (great 32 year old guy, chemical engineer) & H-honey (26 year old sweet girl, environmental engineer). There’s this friend of ours M-money minded (31, chemical engineer; I owe my nickname to him!). Well he is really forgetful & must be reminded about gathering every once in an hour so he can show up! (Ah, did I forget to mention he is a flirt? Though once you get to know him it won’t bother you!) & he had not showed up for the last tow meetings…. Last night I was in math class when he called me out of the blue & left a message…. It was not clear & I just could recognize few words:  “hey… about tomorrow date… make it tonight… give me a call….”   What on earth was the reason he called? What date? Did I miss something? I just couldn’t help feeling tense; the thoughts were pondering on my head while I was calling him….  “Hello?”  He said surprised! “What’s up?” I asked frightened! He paused for a moment & then burst out to laugh… & between laughter he tried to explain what was wrong! “ You… another… tonight… sms …” was all I could get! At last he managed to breathe & told me”  goodness, I wanted to call someone else but I didn’t have the number so I decided to call-back on his sms & it seems I dialed your number instead!”  Can you just imagine me? I was flying off the handle but before I could shout anything, he said:  “have you ever been in love?”  & I was like huh? He said:  “well, you can tell how I feel right now!”   He is lucky I like him or else he had been dead by now!

      I really loved m-blog, though it had been rather simple & one couldnâ€™t change the layout & if you werenâ€™t a paying member you couldnâ€™t put links in your postsâ€¦. But still I made really great friends there & it gave me an opportunity to exchange ideas with wonderful people with different cultural background. I shared my fun, my fear, my emotions with themâ€¦. Iâ€™ve learned so much & itâ€™s amazing how my own view have changed toward the world. M-blog has this advantage that you can be notified of new posts by checking the main page. So it was easy to keep up with your friends. But I had this buzz for sometime that I should become a paying member to be able to update blog! & simply itâ€™s impossible to pay from Iran so you got it! I moved here!  But I really missed everyoneâ€¦. Itâ€™s like leaving home somehowâ€¦ you move away from those youâ€™re acquainted with & had to make new friends. Well, letâ€™s face blogspot!

      Well I have this very funny cousin who got married few years ago. We used to be really close & have kind of strong bond between us. He used to be like a big, protective, funny brother to me & as he himself refer to it; we used to have our moments! Though we grew apart for sometime but still we know we can rely on each other. (Good that his wife understands the relationship) Feeling dizzy could be a great gift; dismissing you from clean-up work after the party. So last weekend in my aunt’s house after supper all I have to do was to sit on the sofa & use my imagination…. Then he showed up & sat himself comfortably by my side & start joking about my dreams…. “So are we gonna elope to a cliff- cottage by Pacific Ocean & live happily ever after?” he joked. “Maybe we should take Mar too! Me & you & Mar (his wife)! Just think of the humid whether & you’ll forget your headache….” He suggested knowing how I hate humid whether! But the hint was enough I was immediately drifted to a reverie visualizing the cottage & envisioning the surrounding! He kept talking & pulled me in for a brotherly hug…. I didn’t even notice! Feeling much better I murmured “not a good idea! I may go there alone, live away & you can just pay visits every once in a while.” I could almost picture myself standing by a railing overlooking the ocean… the salty warm wind blowing & the silence…. “Wow,” he said “come back sis! We’re in Iran still!” He just ruined the dream! & even worse he joked about it all night & still every once in while he sends sms to remind me of MY LITTLE SCERET COTTAGE!

      Thursday, December 4, 2003 The subject is hanging around my mind for quite a while. As I sit here & try to define what my thoughts are, it’s dancing in my brain like a naughty child.  Where did it first come to me? I don’t know exactly…. I mean one day I wake up & it was there. But of course I put off thinking about it, just pushing it away so I can concentrate more on study.  Then this dizzy feeling started to creep in my head. & little by little I adapted myself with rescheduling my life, & changing my body clock so I would be asleep in the pick hour of dizziness. (I’m still in the process of recovering though).  What really bother me was the way my friends acted toward my personal problem… they just freaked out, scared & tried to help me by worrying about my health. Which I do appreciate but it gave me some sort of a feeling that my privacy is invaded…. So foolishly I got into a fight with them over nothing! & well, Ava suggested that I must reconsider myself, my behavior &…. Then it came to me once again & stronger… what am I doing? Not that I really don’t know, but it just doesn’t seem right anymore. This whole Masc. exam thing is just a cover to get me through another day. Actually I’m not even trying to study… & that’s very surprising! I used to dream myself being a professor teaching! & that means I have to work harder!  Yet it doesn’t seem right anymore! Yeah, if I’m to live for another 50 years, that would be what I should do. But if I die tonight, I would think that it was all waste of time! I do like Food Science & for sure I can handle factory or research jobs…. Still it wouldn’t satisfy me.  What I really want to do is wake up late, take my cup of tea & cookies to my bed & read the whole day (Like in summer vacations). & also I love to unleash my imagination, set it free & write down my dreams… or maybe get lost some where in dream-land & never face the reality of cold sabotaging life. Find it ironical?  So I’m still bewildered not knowing which way to go. Choose the decent life line & do as what I’m supposed to do, being the perfect first-borne, go find some cool job & rule everybody’s life till the time I find enough power to rule mine. Or fulfill my lazy dreams & take some time off & lower the chance of Admission in Masc. program?  The point is I’m doing the latter but it’s a burden on my conscience & I can’t enjoy it! What would you have done if you were in my shoes?

      Saturday, November 15 It’s kind of weird…. I’m sitting here in my room & though the weather is really nice, I don’t feel like going out! Tonight is a praying-night. We call it Ahya. It’s been said that the real meaning of Koran had fallen to Mohammad’s heart on a night like this. So people spend the whole night praying & ask God to forgive them. I find the religious gathering to pray rather boring. I feel I can’t pray when all these people are around me. They just cry & if you don’t they think you’re not praying! So I rather spend the Ahya nights on my own talking to God in my own language instead of repeating some incomprehensible verses. Well, maybe it’s not right but that’s how I feel toward praying. Wow! There’s this cool breeze blowing in the night but still we’ve got lots of sunshine. The weather is lovely like the spring time. It had not gone below 10 centigrade degree & you know with sun & … you just need nothing to feel happy. It seems the laughter is in the air, just breath & bliss fill you…. Wind just give me the feeling that nothing is eternal; so I seize the moments & enjoy myself. Why worry about the time which had not come? Each day is a gift; I may spend it in happiness or ruin it with anger! & you know what my choice is…. Let’s live!  Hey, Ava’s birthday is in tow weeks! She is somehow upset & doesn’t want the band to get together for her birthday. We could have planned really fine day but she is not in the mood for that. So I’m wondering if we could find a way to celebrate her birthday without hanging out & stuff. Though I find a cool new place to hang out I want to try right after Ramadan! (Guess what? I think this study agenda is never gonna be fulfilled!) You know gotta get back to study some Food Preservation & then some awful Canning Process….   Tuesday, November 11, 2003 1:48 AM hey I'll be back soon  I don't know why I can't post long entries here! but I'll be back soon!

      Saturday, November 1, 2003  The holy month has just started! This month is like a escape for me… there’s this divine feeling in the air! Like you can feel the God near you! Fasting in Islam is different from other religions; we don’t eat or drink anything from sun-raise to sun-set…. But this is only the superficial part of fasting. In more profound layers, when you look deep in the fact of fasting, you see that the whole body goes through it… one must not lie, backbite or swear for example. You go on practicing the real Islam in a month! Don’t break a heart! Give away gifts & pray! Maybe it’s kind of weird but while on fasting I feel God had taken me in his arms & he is taking care of everything I’m doing. He guides me to choose the right decision & it seems I don’t have to worry about anything…. When I pray he really listens & no matter what would be I’m asking he gives it to me.  Islam says wash & put your best dress on, wear your make-up & perfume then head to say prayers…. I love doing that in fasting month, just to drift away with angels…. Maybe some people out there don’t believe in God. But they would believe in some super-natural powers & this power is really working in Ramadan!  Anyway everything is just going great over here! We’ve had some rains & most days are windy… I love the weather! One day I will set off & I would go on & on till I find the end of the world, if the weather would be like this! Then I will build a hut there & live happily to the end of my days

      Friday, October 24, 2003 Well, I met this guy few days ago. He was a tall, well-built cute guy & I just couldn’t guess that he would know me somehow! I was just walking to school; the weather was so fine & I was just drifting in my dreams…. Suddenly someone called my name; better to say scream it! I turned around & found the guy looking at me. “Hey this is Abtin” he said. I still shocked asked him “what?” & he said “Abtin; the gym?” then I was able remember him…. He was my classmate in gym, couple of years younger than me. He & a friend of his, Ahmad, used to be partners in practice. I was so happy to see him again, though he was far changed… no wonder we hadn’t met for 12 years. He asked me if I could remember he & Ahmad was always fighting over being my partner. Of course I could, they were in total agreement with each other but when it came to choose partners for practice… it was like they can not act morally! They would cheat or simply pick fighting! I always thought it was because I had been the quickest girl in gym & also I was the leader player in practice…. He said “did you know we were in love with you?” it was unbelievable! How could 8-9 year-old boys fell in love with a 10-year? & what more they could still remember every little thing we had done…. I’m flattered right now! He said his girlfriend is one of our classmates & that she can remember how they used to act foolishly when I was around…. It’s a really good feeling to find out you had been someone’s sweetheart! He made my day….

      Tuesday, October 14, 2003 Well I guess you have heard of her enough for sure. But let me play my own part, telling you what I know of her… not much though! The first time I ever heard of her was in 1998… when tow of her clients stabbed & killed savagely in some sort of a series of political clean-up murders…. We knew about them & for sometime every body that was actively or even passively involve in political reformist party like nehzat azadi, has the fear of being murdered! She started to speak up for her late clients (Daruish & Parvaneh Foruhar). She is 56 right now. & she has been the first woman judge before revolution. But she lost the title after 1979 due to Shari law! So she began her career as a lecturer in university, at the same time she was a lawyer…. What she is more concerned about is children’s & women’s rights! Along with other lawyers she established an NGO the Centre for the Defense of Human Rights. & it’s been said she is going to donate the prize award to it! As far as I can remember she had spent some time in solitary confinement for she had been involved in putting a videotape in spotlight which contained statements of a spy in intelligence ministry I guess! She is banned from attending the court for 5 years…. But none of these actually stopped her. Over here in Iran the radio & the TV keep silence about the prize just mentioning it in cultural news. No wonder they are controlled by some hardliners! But everybody is talking about it…. I have always been very proud of being born as Iranian, yet now I feel sow I can be more confident in announcing my nationality! Some people stated that pope was more eligible for the prize. I see their point of view & I know he is a great man. Yet I don’t like to think of the selection as a humiliating act. I mean why it is looked like an Iranian Moslem woman has defeated pope? I hope he will understand what the prize means to a country like mine…. You can read the noble announcement in the address below: http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/video/39434000/rm/_39434586_nobel10_announcement_vi.ram

      Saturday, October 11 t was perfect! My favorite Iranian singer is Alireza Asar…. He has a very strong voice… & miss poetess had bought us the first row tickets! He was singing in front of me! Very great time I had there tonight. & yes Shirin Ebadi won the noble prize for peace! She is a lawyer & she had done so much for children welfare & manages some NGOs over here…. Tonight Asar had special thanks & well wishing for her…. Today seems very good day for me the news of the noble prize & listening to noble music is really charming! One of the songs played was “that’s not the shape of my heart” OSD of “specialist”… my friend briefly told me about the story… I can’t tell you how I felt … very much moved by that! Actually it’s always like that with me. I let the music to take control of me…. Sometimes I feel I had traveled in time & space when a melody is in the air. I know nothing of music. I don’t ply anything. Yet it doesn’t stop me from drowning in notes, floating with rhythms or breathing with the beats! Though melody & harmony are very important, I find lyrics (for the song only) as fundamental. Just some words & you feel your heart starts to race…. Tonight there was a song played about death… very moving. First I started to tremble but by the end of the track I was shivering holding my friends hands tightly… & my heart was beating like a bird….  Asar played some of his old compositions & there was one special song I really loved it goes like this: Who is totally mad? Who dies for your tune of laughter? Who, when you are thirsty  Explore all the clouds & dies but won’t let you in? It’s me! It’s me who sang your eyes poem There are tears in my eyes still, When I remember you! You still strode in my dreams In my dreams In loving nights I whisper to the lord above I wish she would be back! This music, this special song makes me wonder if any one can love me like this…. Except for my dad! (This is a song from a dad I guess) My, we met one of the best songwriters in the hall… Shahkar Bineshpajhoh… (His name means “well-done” in English)! Got to go to bed I cant lift my eyes… good night!

      Monday, September 29, 2003 It seems every one get a career to do & so there is no time to play! The strange thing I’ve never noticed is the nights! I mean it tend to be very quiet after 9 pm around my place…. Like everyone stays home!  The weather gets kind of cold & yesterday evening when I was walking home, I felt really chilled! Guess I picked up cold! I have sore throat & feel a little bit dizzy. So I’m taking pills & I slept all day long! You see can go studying this way & tomorrow I have my first session of classes! No more nagging! I hope I will get better in a day or tow. Right now I want to tell you about my study agenda. It’s nice to let others know what you’re doing! I’m so lazy; don’t study on my own so it’s really cool to have others asking about my progress ;).  I have to study at least 80 pages per day to be able to study all the books & notes in 3 months! The most important courses are food chemistry & food microbiology which I have to study each day & food technologies are going to be divided into 2 sets for every tow days. Then there are math & food engineering & sure English text comprehension!  My days will start at 7. I may go walking for half an hour depending on my mood or I would plainly lie in my bed day dreaming. Then I will have breakfast & at 8 I will start studying taking breaks every 45 minutes for a quarter an hour. 1-2 pm would be my launch time & again I will work till 5. (This part may change due to my classes every day). Then 7 or 8 I will have dinner & study till 11 or more. & I will have 2 days off in a week! IF I would ever hold to this agenda I will study more than 9 hours a day!  Believe me! I’ve never been such a hard working person! I used to take my time at leisure, having fun during my school time. So I gathered if I could stick on to the agenda for 50 working days during these 3 months, I will achieve my goals! I like complicated & flexible agendas. Using this method I have to set my daily plans myself & depending on my mood. But sometimes it become somewhat tricky; like when I’m unconsciously avoid studying the lessons I don’t like or the time when I spent too much time on little useless parts. You may notice that the breaks are too close together. Catgirl believes this way she can’t concentrate on her study. She says it takes her half an hour to focus on the subject & if she has to take a break in 45 minutes, well she will never get on with what she is reading!  I’m totally different. I can ponder easily for a short time; in other words my concentration works rather temporarily! & I get drifted easily… give 5 minutes to study something & ask me what it was about, I will explain everything you want; then give me an hour to study the same thing, I need to review the whole text in the last minute cos I already forgot where it had been started! (Sorry, it’s really hard to explain it…) my concentration is like lightening I may say quick, short but very powerful. So I use lots of breaks to avoid being distracted! Tricky, huh? Besides, I will go on a trip in 3 weeks! & then it will be our fasting month, RAMEZAN…. Who says I will hold on this agenda? ;)

      Tuesday, September 16 Yeah, fall is here at last! What a wonderful feeling it is to…. Officially autumn starts on September 23rd, yet you can feel it in the air. The cool breeze blows & days start to shorten. Autumns are truly beautiful here, full of colors! You may sit by the window & look at the city in the last crimson rays of sunshine or you may go walking under gold & brown trees, enjoying leaf-rain! Did you ever notice the music of leaves beneath your feet, singing: “nothing is eternal”?  Autumns are perfect time to fall in love… just wake up in an autumn day & you may fall in love with the breeze or pale morning sky, or you may fall for the rain, or simply it could be weather you’re in love with! & you can dream perfect dreams as long as you want and as far as your mind can fly. Keep floating in the air & nothing will be impossible for you…. Mehr, the first month of fall, is the beginning of school time! So to me it is a reminder of joy, anxiety, & sure friendship. People over here start rather routine life with the onset of autumn. Laziness & drowsiness 0f summer fade away as it start to get colder! One may notice some kind of movement in every creature… like every one tends to establish new projects! & before long you find yourself involving in one, not remembering when you had started it! Tehran is filled with joy these days… to welcome the beginning of the season! Kids go shopping & in a week or so you can hear their laughers & roars going to school & back! It seems everyone is hanging right now before a race to start. The only thing I don’t like in autumn is this racing mood! You suddenly find the world revolving faster & the heavy morning traffic… one never gets used to! Tehran can not handle transportation of more than a million students every morning! If you ever come here to try going anywhere by car at 8 am, you probably won’t get to the place before 10.

      Saturday, September 6 I was reading TIK’S blog. She is a great writer & I always enjoy her posts but the post about the final hour of being 34 was something else, wonderful!  It made think about what that really means… the passing of years! I mean as I look back I don’t think there are lots of changes in me since my 16-year-old life. & when ever I read TIK blog I feel she could be the same age as me. My birthday is December 31st. So I always had kind of feeling that the world steps into a new era with each birth day I have. Yet each year when I wake up to say good morning to January 1st, I look out the window & I see the same comforting, familiar view. The only thing that is really changed is my pine tree! When I was young I used to dream that I would get downstairs to the yard by the means that tree. (It was rather short then, just up to the 3rd floor; we live in fourth!) Then out of the blue it grew taller & about three or four years ago, I found out the tree is up to my bedroom window. Guess what? This year it has grown over the roof of the building!  & to tell you the truth, I feel that’s a small sing of me growing old…. My dreams grow old with me too; they change from now & then. & it seems that everything is growing with me in a way that makes me ignore my own ageing.  Yet the progress is so slow my brain doesn’t notice it… the point is the person I call me is changing for sure; but I hadn’t change ever since I can remember. Do you see what I mean? People don’t understand their own changes.  My very dear TIK, what is it like to be 35? You achieved so much & there is so much to gain yet! So I wish you a bright, hopeful year! May your dreams grow in this year & the sense of being wise & young at the same time lingers in your heart!

      Thursday, August 28 Different people surely have different tastes. So there is not a single rule for telling you where to go. Yet I may be able to show where we hang out as students! Fancy restaurants are the least expected place to hang out with friends. They are expensive & you can’t laugh loudly or do whatever you want to do there. I know some places where you can go as couple but not when you are with a bunch of wild free young boys & girls. Hotel lobbies are like that (though I, myself, have had some cool friend- gatherings in Sheraton).  I’ve tried JAM-E-JAM too. But to tell ya the truth, it was like you have to be the princess there. SORENTO is even worse! I know some etiquette rules yet practicing them don’t appeal to me!  On the other hand, old shabby GHAHVEKHOONE (cafés) are not what you may find desirable to go out to. They are located in older parts of Tehran & well I get the sense that the environment is kind of MANLY. A girl is not supposed to be seen there (I am an exception once again, being at least in one with my uncle). Another kind of these places is KALEPAZIS. They serve a special kind of food; kind of soup by lamb meat which is served mostly as an energetic breakfast. I don’t know is it because most girls don’t like the food or something else that I’ve never seen one inside one of these cafes.  So where do we hang out? There are lots of cafés around the town where they serve light meals & stuffs like coffee, tea, &…. & there are the fast foods. & some of SOFREKHANE HAYE SONTAI (traditional restaurants) is fine.  I’ve tried some cafes over here. Some are ok, some perfect & some are plain rubbish! Some the famous ones I don’t like. They are unfriendly & crowded like GHROOB, SADAF, TOOTFARANGI, ARIAN, &…. I used to hang out there but now…  DIDANIHA is my hang out right now. But it’s getting crowded & I’m looking for some other place. You know the have risen the price without reason. I used to say the price is reasonably high there but now it’s not fair! Yet I’ve got to declare that I had very good cappuccinos there that make me go back for more. Chicken Fingers are really delicious & other things are quite ok! I go there with 3 or 4 different bunch of friend so they really know me!  We used to hang out in SHEYTH it’s a very quite, rather small place. No one would drop by accidentally there so it used to be our secret hang out. We, the girls, would go there at 12 have the most delicious pizzas & fine coffees & talk for 3 or 4 ours about useless, small things. It had been very deserted I used to think why they don’t close it! My, I long for our private talks there. We used to read poems by HAFEZ (who is one of the best Iranian poets) & interpret the poems. We call this FAL GEREFTAN. Guess we shall go there again when Miss Poetess (who is away to seaside) get back!

      Monday, August 18 Well, my grandpa is writing about breads & foods. So I decide to write about some of the Iranian foods. But I won’t write about recipes cos I really don’t know anything about cooking. In my opinion cooking is an art one shall have the talent of. & I do believe that people shall not cook when they don’t want to. It makes the food taste awful! Mom used to say the mood is shown in the food & that’s really true.  Any way, Iranian foods are so different from western ones. It takes much more time to cook them & the smell is sharp. (You can smell a food Like Gormesabzi from a far distance.) They are really delicious but there are tricks to cook them correctly. & the same food may be cooked in different styles in different regions of my country.   My favorite one: of course Gormesabzi! It’s a kind of stew we eat with rice. The stew consists of herbs (including leek, French marigold & fenugreek) meat chops & kidney beans. It smells wonderful. If I had to choose just one kind of food Gormesabzi would be my choice. Tehranian Gormesabzi is green & the liquid part is somehow serrated one may say. The meat chops may contain bones too. But my dad likes the herbs to be fried until they turn blackish green & we use more beans. Our stew is more solid & meat chops doesn’t consist of bones. This is the only food we don’t cook in tehranian way. The next stew is Geymeh. It’s a light brown stew consisted of cotyledons, small meat chops, kind of lime & of course tomato extract. Cooking it is easier & when you want to serve a lot of people it’s a good choice. I’ve never met any one who didn’t like this stew. Well, I like it but it won’t be my first choice. Fesenjoon is the next stew. I don’t like it at all! It has nut, onion & meat balls. Though you may use meat, chicken or turkey chops instead. It’s a dark brown stew & in official ceremonies you find it as an important course. God knows I can’t eat it! So many people just love this food. You may like to have it sweetened with sugar or have it sour.   Rice is a main food here. But it is cooked in special ways, not like Indians or Far-easterners. We eat plain rice which may be called POLO or CHELO or KATE, depending on how you cook it.  There are some kind of mixed- rice. I mean they are POLOS mixed with other kind of herb, vegetables, and meats and….. BAGHALI POLO is one of them which is mixed with broad beans & served with meat chops or chicken. LOBIYA POLO is my favorite mixed food. It has string beans & small meat chops. AADAS POLO is another one I don’t like much. It has lentil; & is often served with a dressing made of small plums/raisins grinned meat & onion.  Still, there is a food I haven’t told you about! It’s KABAB! If you get in one of these Iranian restaurants you find too many kind of it! It’s, let’s say, our official food! You may call it barbeque. Yet it’s different from the ones you have over there. Try it once & you never forget the taste.  There are so many kinds of food I haven’t talked about. Like the soups, ASH, ABGOOSHT. You see, I can’t tell you all about it! But I promise if you ever wanted to come over here, I can show you how they taste!

      Wednesday 6th August Yesterday was spent riding, all day long riding. Yet I don’t feel tired at all! The road was so spectacular, I thought it would lead to heaven (which unfortunately doesn’t). We set off in the morning to KHALKHAL, where my young cousin was taken to hospital for food poisoning. In my opinion it could be E.COLI or Salmonella; he had eaten too much of the ASH-DOOGH (kind of Iranian soup) I guess. Any way, he feels much better right now. But the injection made him asleep & he missed the views! The road between KHLKHAL & ASTARA is a mountain-road surrounded by frost. & some gypsies are living there. Parts of the road are near the farms & since you’re looking at them from above, they look like hand-made quilts, different colors, and different shapes. The whole surrounding was like it had been sketched & painted by hands of a professional painter. I wish I could stay the rest of my day there just going up & down the road, appreciating the Divine beauty. & if it was ever possible to stop the time passing by, I would have cut those moments, make them eternal! We stopped in a misty hill to have something for lunch. One feels she can get lost in the forest & explore the mysteries forever. Enough! I wish I could post the film my cousin had taken from the road. Then you would understand what I’m talking about. As we were on the peak, my aunt said something that is carved in my memory: “up here I feel closer to God.” This is really true. Beholding the harmony that exists in the nature makes you believe in some kind of power in it; you may call it fate, Mother Nature or… but I like to call it God.  In the evening we left the misty forest & got to the seaside. It seems to me that no Divine feeling can stand the hot humidity of the Caspian seaside! You see, when you can not breathe, thinking gets impossible. & I can’t breathe in humid weather. So I really don’t like the bay. & I won’t go swimming like others. Actually we are at the seaside & I’m staying in shade & others have gone to the protected areas to swim…. & they will be back as brown as a berry. We’ll be home tonight; this is the only thing I can fix my mind on right now. How do I long to sleep in my bed, hugging my doll! My, I forgot, I’ve bought a light yellow dog-doll yesterday & I called it stupid! It looks rather bewildered & foolish! My sister had picked it for me…. That’s all!

      Monday 4th August Hadn’t been writing for 3 days! & the last 2 days was great! Some times people surprise you with their potential power to delight others…. Anyway, Saturday was bank holiday & we decided to go to BABAK’s Castle, a very beautiful hillside (is the word correct?), 200 km from Tabriz. My right leg was hurting so much (still I have trouble walking & I keep putting off my appointment with doctor!). I thought the pain would fade away as time goes by, but it didn’t. & by the time we got to the place, it was aching so much I couldn’t even walk! Guess I shouldn’t have run on the hills the previous day. I climbed down to the place others had settled themselves in, but it was rather cold & desolately I climbed back up to the car. Not long had passed when my Tabrizian friend (my cousin’s cousin, the same age as me) joined me in the car. I was totally depressed & you feel it from the previous post. & here he came to me, sitting there, we talked for hours…. Actually he made my day but I don’t think he himself had good time with me nagging. It had been a very cool talk. There was kind of misunderstanding in our relationship & we had drifted apart & the distance makes it rather hard to overcome. Sometimes you know something is wrong but you can’t stop it! He had changed & me too; so we surprised each other a lot.  In the evening, he suggested we would go up to castle by car. The castle is located on the peak of mount & you have to drive to a hotel up on the road & there are 1000-something steps waiting for you to get in to the castle. (Not a surprise how BABAK has been fighting in it for 10 years!) To tell ya the truth, I like the idea so much I ignored my hurting feet! However my friend’s brothers had gone up there by another car & had taken our car’s key with them! So the plan dumped :P. (we went up to hotel later with others.) it was 1o’clock when finally we got back home & we were to set off early in the morning to Astara; that meant we wouldn’t come back to Tabriz again! Guess what the next day nobody really wanted to hit the road. We had enjoyed ourselves so much; it didn’t seem fair to leave the FRIENDS in Tabriz! We spent the morning packing but in the afternoon Maragheh (a town 100 km south Tabriz) was where we ended up! Folks went shopping in bazaar. I had this feeling that our group was kind of freak there! The idea of us being aliens was a popular one there, I may say! We had dinner in the town & went back to Tabriz to spend our last night there. I don’t think anybody had slept last night. We were up till tow in the morning & I could hear whispers before I fell asleep at 5 am. Today at last we set off & left the friend behind. We’re staying the night in SA’REIN, a town with natural warm springs. I never really liked water (don’t be upset about me TIK). So the town is rather boring & I keep missing these friends of ours. Mom just called them & they were out to a party…. No more complaining; I’ll be home in 2 days & they will come to visit us in September.

      Friday 1st August We went to Marand a town in west side of Iran. Late last night we decide we would hire a bus to take us all there. So we had to wake up really early this morning to catch bus at 6:30; but we waited for some friends to join us till 8:30. Then we move out of town; the driver was an angry guy, I can tell you. He told us not play music instruments in the bus. But who cares! Some friends had brought SETAR (kind of string music instrument) & TONBAK (percussion). & they played some Turkish songs. It was perfect. We had brunch in a remote area. Going up on a hill by bus, we had a 10- minute walk to a small spring. The weather was so beautiful & everything was so calm. (I’m sure you would have loved the place grandpa!) We stayed for a while enjoying ourselves, listening to good music… at least we set off to Marand. There we had a minor problem with the bus, so we head back to Tabriz.  Sitting in the yard, I’m trying t tell ya how I feel. Still there is something wrong; I don’t know what it is. Anyway, I try to make myself at home. I’ve talked with Ava this very morning, yet I miss her. I miss Tehran & my bedroom. I have not been adapted. It seems I can communicate with even my close relatives. When I look back at the days I had been 16 & I was here in Tabriz; seems like ages had passed by without me noticing it. The whole town had changed & I have changed too. Guess I am homesick! ;) What I really long for is a company of some one who would understand my morals…. What bless is to have a friend to talk to & a home to return!

      Thursday 31st July Well, the journey wasn’t really supposed to be like that! We had headed straight to Tabriz! & lets-play-it-by-ear journeys are not my cup of tea! Any way we set off at 5:30 am. & there is these 3 days of bank holiday; so too many people had actually hit the road, mostly heading north to seaside. It was really strange to see the highway jammed with cars at that time of the morning! As we moved to the west, crowd disappeared.  I really didn’t feel ok about the journey, however, little by little, with the Westlife song “miss you nights” the sun started shining! I wish the road would never end! Tabriz … is a completely different city. Sometimes you feel you’ve walked in another country. People speak Turkish & I don’t even know a word! I feel rather like a stranger here, sort of overlooked. Speaking Persian is weird here & you are treated like a nice guest who would never be part of the society; if you know what I mean. Not all the people are like that; still the atmosphere seems rather unfriendly! But I dare say I like Tabriz more than Isfehan. (You may have heard about this town….) We are staying with some acquaintances over here. And this bunch of 20 humans will have fun together!

      Tuesday, July 22, 2003 I hate shopping! If you ever wanted to hurt me, make me do shopping. The only thing I like to buy is book. You know I rather die than to go shopping, talking to sell assistants, and asking about something &…. I always make a fool of myself doing them! Anyway, it’s an important part of living. I have no idea how on earth the shopping habits could be different from one society to another. & I consider it rather personal than social. (I have a totally different shopping habit than the rest of my family.) Buying clothes is the worst part of shopping. I hate trying on dresses in shops & it is impossible for me to find the right suit & sometimes it gets on my nerve when sellers try to advise me about some rubbish ones. I don’t care about my looks, thereby most of the time I’m wearing the same old cloths that I have; yet I really like colors to go with each other. My mother does the shopping for me all the time & I’m satisfied with it as long as it doesn’t mean I have to try them on! ………. When I go shopping, I rather know the exact brand, mark & etc. this way there would be less chaos & finding the right one is easier. My folks like to go window-shopping. I mean it’s a kind of hobby. You go window shopping & you have fun! So most of the time it’s considered a good refreshing act. Where to shop? It depends on how much you want to spend & what you want to buy! There are cool shop centers where you can discover so many beautiful things but the price is so high you rather watching than buying! The point is you can go to GOLESTAN shop center, just to have fun. (Although I found very nice things at very low price there! But that’s a secret how!) You can find almost everything there & if you feel like it, you can have something at on of the cafés there. Some folks date out there & the street “IRANZAMIN” is one of the most famous ones for joyriding. Another shop center is GHAEM! It’s not a bad one but I find it a rather boring place. It gives me an unfriendly feeling; yet if you’re looking for weird kind of things, tries it. I forget “SAFAVIEH”, though it’s smaller than the others, there you may find really cool stuff (especially “dating stuffs”) Well, there are some areas where you can go for shopping too, like MOHSENI square, VANAK square, VALIASR Avenue & bazaar for sure. The price is lower relatively. I like shopping in VANAk; maybe because I can get there in 10 minutes from home. But it also got an inviting environment. (Well, these days it becomes so crowded; & I don’t feel like going there anymore.) I used to go to a café there, but it was closed. On VALIASR you may find some cheap stuff & some rather expensive ones.  Bazaar is the main marketing place in Tehran. It’s been said that most of the purchases happen there. Yet it still has a rather traditional look! You may walk in one of these old dark chambers & find someone purchasing via internet! It is located in south part of Tehran on a large area. & the architecture plans are so complicated, you feel like you’re trapped in a maze. I’ve been there just 2 or 3 times, & I assure you I may have got lost if Katharine had been around! But there’s this “SHARAF O ESLAM” restaurant which is also called “ISLAMI”. (it got nothing to do with Islam, it’s the name of the owner.) I have had a very delicious CHELO KABAB there. What’s CHELO KABAB? Wait until I write about Iranian foods!

      Sunday, July 20 What’s that in your voice makes me turn to you? What’s that makes me hypnotized, not knowing what to do? Make me feel like holding you close, giving away everything to hear your laughter chimes around me. Tell me what fills the air when you’re near; how do you shake my heart caressing my hand. Don’t tell me anyone else could do it! I’m not buying that. Call out my name; the rhythm is saying so much. & don’t run; it’s here; it’s me!

      July 16 The last post was terrible. My daily life during last 2 weeks was very hectic. I thought “the exams are over” & so peace & comfort is here. Conversely there’s no rest for me…. I AM RESTLESS! I have been out almost everyday, & still I haven’t done what was planned. I have to go shopping (which I hate!), set an appointment with my physiotherapist (my leg still hurts & I can’t go jogging…), meet some of my high school friends (I miss them so), & plan for studying my M.S. exam……..  The point is I hadn’t done anything useful all this time. & my plans for Graduation Ceremony are totally changed due to the financial problem I mentioned before. More than 60 students were supposed to join up for the ceremony & there are only 48 names on registry list. Most of our friend took the ceremony for granted. They just throw ideas at us & then leave us helpless. What’s more they think it’s their right to go around saying we’re doing a mess, as though we’re not trying our best. But right now I’m feeling ok with anything that may come around, the comments really cheer me up & writing helps me to overcome every misfortune. Hey, my dad just brought me a mug of cold banana milkshake! Life is wonderful!

      Tuesday, July 15 Really what is it? I would never be able to tell you, ‘cos I’ve never been in love. & I don’t know anyone who really is capable of loving me….  I received this email about kids who define love & there are lots of nice words, still I can’t figure out what love is. Sometimes I can’t even tolerate my intimate ones, so how can I love some one I don’t know? It’s silly. I love human beings but that’s not “love” if you know what I mean. ….   The matter has always been sort of taboo for me, a border I never step out of. The more I think about it, the more I understand that love is something I can’t get near to. People tend to run away when they get to close to me, because they are hurt. Even my close friends can’t bear me for a long time. On the other hand, I myself can’t start a relation & if any one does that, he/she would be turned down! What’s more I tend to give more in beginning, and then I start demanding more & more. Most people cease their friendship there….  A friend once told me that it’s about me not giving others the chance to love me! How can I give anybody a chance when there is no demand for it? By the way, as I tell others about my bad temper; those who know me a little don’t believe it! Like I don’t know myself. However as I reveal the characteristics they’ve been told about, I’m accused of being deceitful….  Strange, yet true; I’m not capable of loving & being loved…

      Wednesday, July 9, 2003 Well, Mat is writing a Persian blog. I am dieing to know what he is writing about! Actually the blog idea was his. We were talking about it for some time. & now that we have more free time I push him to start bloging…. He is a good writer & I’m sure he can do it………  Blogs in Iran & in Persian are much different from these ones we have here. Most of bloggers are teenagers, so energetic & they write about almost anything… like their daily life, Politics, movies, even computer training, & ….  Persian is the 4th language blogs are written in. it’s amazing to read the blogs. Different tastes, different points of view but still they got something in common. They try to express themselves to prove they are alive, they exist. Over here in M-blog we have a rather closed group of readers; only those who write here check other blogs (or those who know about a special blog). It is cool somehow. & has some advantages like I’m sure some people will never find my blog! But tow main blog space providers in Persian (blogsky & persianblog) are often searched by non-bloggers or better to say blog readers….  Blogspot as a known blog provider is hosting lots of Persian blogs too. & recently persianlog is joining other providers…. Most of blogs have these links to other similar or non-similar blogs, so sometimes I start checking a blog & end up finding new blogs better than the first one. Unfortunately, most bloggers don’t update the blogs regularly which means you have to check in once in while. I myself check more than 30 blogs. Some are my M-blog friends; some are other English Iranian blogs & some Persian ones. Guess what? I think I’m addicted doing that!

      Saturday, July 5, I declare I am a bookworm. Any readable thing appeals to me. Sometimes I pick up a book & start reading it then when I put it down, I find out some hours had past & I don’t even notice it.   Right now I’m reading 3 books together & I think they will be finished by Saturday night. The first is “Catcher in the Rye” by Salinger. I have read it before by another translator. I quite liked it. The other one is “la palais des solitudes”. It’s been written by Soraya Esfandiyari Bakhtiyari, ex-queen of Iran. The book is written in French & I’m reading the translation. (Though it’s not a good one.) The book is an autobiography & some historical events misinterpreted but it sure worth reading. The last one is a book about Persian myths “Persian Mythology” by Hinnells. I love to know about my ancestors. It’s amazing reading about the myths…. I mean  almost everybody know about Roman or Greek myths but no one knows about ours. Even most Iranians don’t know anything about MEHR or EMSHASPANDAN or things like that. All they know is about SHAHNAME & the myths mentioned there….   Do you think I have “flight of idea”? It’s said that changing subjects is a symptom of the disease!   There is some point I don’t understand. People keep wondering how I can handle too many different subjects! & I keep wondering why they can’t. It’s really simple I have different interests so … the books are dissimilar.   Reading books is like a revere. I get lost in the books… finding myself as a character of them. I remember by the end of “Harry Potter & Goblet of Fire”, I closed the book & sit straight in my bed wondering why every thing is normal. You know it was 3 a.m. & silent was the only thing I could hear. Guess what? I sat there for half an hour trying to understand why there hasn’t been an earthquake or something. You see I expected everything to be upside down, since the dark lord had found his power back!   My favorite place for reading? Sure it’s my bed. I love to lie down on my bed & put one of those big cushions under my head & read the whole day. But I can almost read everywhere else. I used to take books to bath. (I’m not kidding!)

      Friday, July 4, 2003 At last summer holidays are here! Though I still don’t feel the summer….summer is a bit drowsy over here. The heat makes you feel sleepy in the afternoon & usually people prefer to stay home & enjoy air condition fans.   When I was younger summers was really HOLY days. You know right after my last exam, I would go to warehouse (in the basement of the building) & bring all my toys to the house. As a child I used to have a lot of toys so at school time in order to make room for my books & notes, the toys would be packed in warehouse. Only some of my favorites were kept…. It was wonderful to have them back; the whole next week would be spent cleaning, putting, and repairing the toys. The result was a complete change in my room’s look. This was the beginning of a 3-month holyday….  We used to wake up at 9, I’d rather stay in my bed for a while daydreaming then I would have something & most of the days I had these classes like English conversation classes, swimming, dancing &… so I would attend them. (It was really fun!) In the afternoon, nap was an obligation… although I never took a nap in the afternoons. I would wait till my granny (who took care of us as my mother was away on work) fell asleep; then I would start playing roles, dreaming. In these dreams I used to be an explorer finding new lands, a witch practicing magic, a rocket scientist, a shop keeper, a gypsy, a princess, and almost everything else…. In the evenings we used to play cards with my parents. Or we would simply go downstairs to parking & the yard to ride bikes, play hide & seek & etc.   The best part of the summer was the books. I carried them everywhere with me. It didn’t make a difference to me, I was reading books all the time…. Philosophy, novels, and scientific fictions &…. You know people here don’t read much I mean the kid just have these study books. Our culture is rather verbal, so people rather hearing thing than reading. I was a totally freak then, better to say a nerd! Books were the main reason I found Katherine….  Things have changed since I was a child. 10 years ago war was nearly over & everybody was trying to build a better life for their children. Now we are settled somehow & well, I have grown for sure. So the summers are too different… during university time I had summer classes; most of them were labs. & God knows they were demanding & kept me connected to school… summers didn’t mean summer like that. Summer jobs are not common in Iran. Just students with financial problems or those who have year-round jobs work. Folks don’t like their children to be working over here…. I myself love to have a summer job but one can’t find a proper, suitable job for summers. Well, I wish I could find a job in a book shop! Then I could read all the time & I could be lost in books forever.   Forget about it. Sun is shining & if you feel like a seaside it’s time to be packing! Ava’s back again…. She sure enjoys seaside… & I will meet her soon! Strange; I miss her like she hadn’t been around for a year but it’s just a week!

      Wednesday, July 2, 2003 So the exams are over. It means that I had my last B.Sc. exams…. Rather sad because I had very good time studying with my friends… also it means that I step in a new era of life. Strange; I don’t feel I have changed! & the only thing I’m thinking of is the long summer holiday & God knows I deserve it. Although I haven’t been studying much but this last semester seems longer than any other one…. My; the very last exam (Food Storage) was pushing on the edge. The professor is a really good one, but when it comes to grades, he seems rather tightfisted. ;) I had other courses with him & to tell you the truth I’ve never got good marks! This exam was completely different. (Maybe because I know the way his questions are.) It was a very cool, easy exam. Actually I wonder why I knew every question’s answer! So I hope I would get an A or at least B+.  The next project in my life is Graduation Ceremony which is going to be held at September 4th. Most of the band members will be graduated the same day & well, we are in charge of the ceremony. (Actually I’m not in charge; but Ava is & also Mat & Mr. President are too. I would only be a helping hand if they need one.) The point is we really don’t know how this ceremony should be held…. I mean we’re looking for others opinion. Any body out there has any idea? Will you let me know how your graduation day was? At least it will give us a rough scheme to start…. Tell ya a secret? I missed writing & I miss you all. :)

      Wednesday, July 2, 2003 Let’s start the story like this: Sunday afternoon we had Quran exam. I mean me, Mat & Pat. I had not seen mat for 2 weeks although we were talking on phone. (I have seen almost everybody else.)  & that would be the last time we would meet as students in school, so when I went in the school café I suddenly had this rush of emotion for him…. I could not believe I would be missing someone this much. He had this five o’clock shadow, & it really goes with him. As I was standing there; it came to me that whatever may be around the corner, I want to save the band’s friendship & unity. If I could, I would set the band like this forever not letting them to change. (Am I selfish?)  I know that we have changed, & the conditions have too. At the same time I’m sure of one thing; the friendship is forever. However, the guys will get married & maybe their wives would not like us to be around! Or visa versa. But certainly I will always consider Mat as a very nice, reliable brother. You know there are things one may only tell a brother like secrets; & there are times one need a good brotherly advice or a helping hand. I will turn to Mat for them. & sometimes there are things you hide from a brother but Mat has this advantage you can tell him what you want. Hey! Don’t you think I’m flattering him a bit? God knows, I miss Ava as well. Haven’t seen her since last Thursday, but it seems ages had passed. She is away on vacation right now. (Her last exam was on Thursday.) Isn’t it funny how I get used to people? Ava, Mat, The poetess and you.

      Thursday, June 19, 2003 I find this part of my dairy quite interesting & so I decide to share it with you. It is about 10th & 11th of June… We had been to a birthday party on the night of demonstration. (I mean we gathered in a restaurant to celebrate a friend, Sapphire, birthday.) Actually it was getting late when we get home & as soon as I walked in I heard my father’s radio (BBC), which was reporting the so called protest. I can tell you I was totally shocked because most of my friends had been to a concert (by Mr. President) in Tehran University & no one was saying anything on the party. I thought it must have been a minor demonstration. But then next morning every body was talking about it….             Wednesday was a very hectic day for me. I had class since 8 in the morning till 6 in the evening & meanwhile I had to go to stationeries to get my project typed. So, you see, I headed to school in the morning, attend one of my classes; then me & Ava take taxi to stationary to do the project thing. (I missed my next class due to that.) Then I had to get back to school on my own ‘cos Ava was going home. Back in school I was told that my “nut” professor had gone & I had to hand in my paper on Saturday which meant I could miss 2 points. Then I desperately went upstairs to his room just to leave a message, & to my surprise I found him there…. So I handed in the paper. Guess what it was 12 & I thought well, I would have time to have a sandwich; what a dream! I was reminded that there had been another class to attend. That means I missed lunch… at 1:30 I went through an oral exam & right after that I had another class; so when at last I got home I was to tiered to listen to radio or else…. All through the day I had been chatting about demonstrations & reasons behind it; I’ve argued with almost every body, then as I was lying there on my bed I understand that I was part of the demonstration without intending to. I spread the news & it came to me that I can’t run from it. So in the middle of the night I got up & turned on the radio…. You know what I heard some Iranians were chanting & somebody was saying we’re coming to Iran. Go on, protest! Today our country needs you. Move! … What would you think if you heard that? These people stay away & order us to sacrifice! That was the point.

      Thursday, June 19, 2003  It seems that I can’t study at all. I mean it’s getting harder to concentrate for me; although I used to do 3-4 jobs at the same time (like listening to music, reading, talking on phone, and counting &…. Now I can’t do that. Studying has been my favorite hobby for the past 16 years so I really can’t see why this thing is happening to me. Well, it’s not about grades I worry. (I’ve got A for my project!) It’s the mood.  Some university exams have been postponed till September due to the demonstrations but not ours. Most of the dormitories of Tehran’s universities are going to be evacuated in order to prevent more demonstrations for 18 TIR (9 July). I can’t see why some students try to put off the exams. ‘Cos this way controlling them becomes much easier & there would be no reason for demonstration at all. ….   Forget about it! I always go down when there are exams ahead. This morning Ava had told me that Teddy is not attending the demonstrations. It’s a very good news for me; he always been rather daring in this situations so I feared he might hurt himself. I have not heard about Mr. President since last Thursday, & I was wondering if he has been out to protest or not. If he was I would have known, so I hope he wasn’t. This tow is our most political friends.

      Tuesday, June 17, 2003  I guess it’s time to write about other realigns in Iran. Actually I was wondering what it is all about that people think we don’t have Jews over here? There is a point in Islam which says we must believe in all the other profits like Moses & Jesse, so practicing their realign is legal. We even have parliament members who have other realign. I, myself, had Jewish friends when I was in elementary school. & in application forms you have this option of announcing your realign & you can choose Jew, Christian, Zardoshti & other. Although I gathered that it’s different if someone is Buddhist; ‘cos Islam doesn’t agree with sculptures worship as Gods; so it would be rather hard to claim someone is Buddhist. Anyway one can practice it without claiming to. No one have the right to inquire after the way you living until you, yourself show it & interrupt others right … Christians have a special stadium here which Moslems can’t enter. & they attend their own churches & if they want they can attend their own schools. In our schools we have realign study & other realigns have their own classes & they have their own exams. We have these NAHAYEE high school exams, which are sort of countywide exams for special grades, and all of the students attend one school in one reign (although they study in different high schools) & I had to attend MARY MANOKIAN high school that belongs to Christians. These schools allow Moslems to enroll…. You see I tried to show what I already knew of the matter & I still search for more information. I called my Christian & Jewish friends to ask them to write something about their life but unfortunately its exam time & they well said they have to study. So as soon as any of them deliver it, I will put it here (without change).  My, I think I shall go back studying. Cross your fingers for me tomorrow I will defend my project & I just feel like an A- grade! ;)

      So I am back! But it’s exam time over here & I HAVE to study if I ever want to graduate this term…. Well, things are getting rather nasty over here. We had this demonstration thing before you may have heard of it, huh? They say people are dancing & saying things against the regime, well I know for sure that these things are true but I’m not sure that anybody got shot down although there are numbers of arresting so far …. Anyway governor tries to close universities for vacation before 9 July (which is the day we had another protest 4 years ago.) so students don’t really know what may come their way. Right now no one really knows what’s going on; I mean it’s just rumors about the whole thing; so I may let you know more if I find more accurate news! ;) Don’t worry if I won’t write in few next week… the exams are here, besides my project gets more demanding each day so I don’t have time even to turn on my computer, updating weblog! No way!:) Something else I may move to a new blog ‘cos I’m afraid I can’t pay m-blog. You see it’s not possible for me to find a way to send the money! Strange? It’s due to economic restrictions in my country. Enough now I’ve got to get back to work.:( Cross your fingers for me.

      Well, I can’t say it’s typical, but it’s what we actually do: my mom usually gets up at 5:30. She works as an accountant in a company out of Tehran so she has to wake up early… (I adore my mom; she is hardworking & she manage everything really coolly. However I used to nag at her for being married to her job! I. L.U. Mom!) She comes in my room to get dressed ’cos we share the closet & so every day I wake up to say goodbye to her. Then if my class wouldn’t be at 8, I will go back to sleep…. I love this part of my day! Sleeping is my favorite hobby. I usually get up at 8 (or 9 sometimes.) & I have breakfast alone… my dad takes my sister to school (he takes me too when I get class at 8…) & he comes back home, park the car & he walks 30 minutes to his office. He is financial Manager. I would do the house work if there would be no class & being left by myself I usually listen to music… Chris de Burgh, George Michael, Elton John, etc I also listen to BSB, Westlife & recently Eminem (I fell for 8 mile music, the movie was great!) me & my dearest sister frequently have lunch together. I wait till she comes home & we’ll have something… I don’t like to have lunch by myself so if no one’s around, there would be no lunch. Then we may watch TV & chat over the day till 5 when my parents show up. We have dinner around 7. It’s the most important meal in my family; we try not to miss it. It’s at dinner’s table where we talk, we decide the important things, and we share our day experience at the table. That’s perfect. Sitting there with my family I feel that I’m very blessed, very much loved. Just sitting there can heal every pain, can solve any problem, like there is magic…. It’s a miracle to have such family. I usually study after dinner or better to say I do the paper works & I occupy myself with the computer... till I got tired & go to bed…. If I would have classes at campus, well, the day is totally different… I will take taxi to Faculty (I told you that my leg is twisted.) being in time, is a good habit of mine. When you get to the class in time, you have time to chat with others & you’ll be informed of anything that happens… you may even find time to sit over an orange juice to discuss its ingredients! Attending the class could be very interesting if the Professor teaches nicely, but it could turn to a complete catastrophe sometimes…. I consider myself a good student; well I have been what you can call a Straight- A-student. That’s not all, the band do a lot of extracurricular activities. We have a gathering named food engineers 78. (We entered university in 1378 year HEJRI SHAMSI) & we’re planning the graduation ceremony right now…. (Isn’t it great to be graduated?) So we have a lot to do. There are always band members around when I go to school, although I don’t have any class with them; so I’m not alone. & that’s very cool! We are famous in school & almost everyone knows us. To tell you the truth I’ve heard a lot of gossip about the band… like it’s been said that the poetess & Mat are dating & so… We spend the time between classes in the school café. We sit there & plan our days. I can tell you what happens when tow of us take a sit there, others comes & join us & little by little the table would be surrounded by friends; God knows we tend to speak loudly so almost every one can hear us talking…. That makes us different from others; they tend to be secret & quite. As far as I can say none of us gives a penny to what others do & say…. We’ve got our own way & we’re following our dreams… so what’s the big deal. Right now that I was typing, suddenly it came to me that I will miss the united band we have when we graduate. I mean we will be seeing each other but it would be completely different. That’s very sad, you loose the friendship & intimacy; forget about it! I’m here to have good time! CARPE DIEM!

      I think there’s a tendency to the idea that Iranians are barber & that they are all terrorists! Or they are all so poor they can’t even feed their children! & I guess most people think time has stopped over here since 25 years ago (when the revolution happened); maybe time even moves back like we travel in time!  You know the image could be so misleading. But we are in a transition era, we’re moving to Modernism. I admit that there are some difficulties; as you say no pain no gain, we’re going at our own pace & pushing forward is no good at all. The image of Iranian all over the world is based on what media show… & some Iranian artists help the image! Namely, our modern movie makers just show poverty & pain like there’s no happiness here. I don’t want to overlook the value of artistic idea & impression in those films, but the fact remains that they ruin the image of my country. I wish you could see movies about our history or the real state of my country…. We have the oil, (though I wish we didn’t have it sometimes.) & so world needs us to feed the factories & to be running … but instead of treating us respectfully, we’re accused of being terrorist & it’s not just about the governor Iranians are treated like that too. Why? I mean if you ever come to Iran, to Persia, you see people are so welcoming. They’re warm & loving. I assure you we are civilized too. & we enjoy modern facilities. It’s common here to use cell phones & computers are becoming a must. The fact that economic prohibition (Americans or any business client shall not by any means deal with Iranians or they can not invest in Iran) keeps of from having so many things doesn’t mean we’re starving! I’m not saying that the economic situation is great, but I’m not saying that it is drowning either. Once I was told that Tehran’s water is the tastiest you can drink, I thought it was a joke but that’s very true… there is something in it you won’t forget. You’re laughing, huh? But I do believe in that! Maybe you think I’m prejudiced or that’s only my loyalty & devotion to my country, anyway I’m in it & I have the chance too look it inside out! I mostly try to show you what I am as a girl & as a student in Tehran. I don’t know what others do or what they may say… I know there are some of my country mates who don’t believe in this regime or else, & they have moved out of Iran. I do respect them but they are not a very reliable source to learn about us. (I don’t mean your very nice friend Thingsiknow.) They’re looking at the matter from outside & most of them tend to judge unfair. You might have been told that in Iran people could be arrested for no reason at all, but have you ever told that it’s safe to stay out till midnight? Have anyone ever told you that Tehran doesn’t sleep; that you may wake up in the middle of the night & hear the laughers & cheering of party gusts who just want to get back home? Life is like that! It’s like anywhere else. We have joy, we have pain, good days or bad ones & you can choose to keep the nice memories or visa versa. I try to enjoy my life & keep the fine ones….

      Well, when we settle down at last, it was time for lunch. We had chicken sliced for us, so the only thing to do was to barbecue them… (We call this food JOOJEHKABAB which means chicken barbecue in English.) The guys start cooking while the girls make other things ready.  Lollypop & Mr. President did most of the cooking & Teddy helped them too. It must have been very delicious, but to be honest I didn’t feel anything when I was eating! ‘Cos Teddy & Mr. President kept telling stories about dirty way of eating & they wanted to make me sick like that. (I’m the hygienist in the band!) These 2 guys are at odds with each other but when it comes to making fun of others, God, they make a united party….  Hadn’t I told you that Pat had music class that day? Well, he wanted to leave as soon as possible, I offered him to pay for the class if he would stay longer but he rejected it…. (However he could not manage to get to the class that day.) As the lunch was over, I guess the Poetess started AB BAZI. (It’s a kind of game; I didn’t know what you may call it in English, the rule is you have to soak others with water until they would be dripping….) I always hated this part of picnics, you know, being soaked is the last thing I want in my life! They didn’t pour water on me ‘cos I couldn’t escape! (One must not be drenched to claim she was the best.) Any way they went on playing, meanwhile Mr. President picked a bottle, filled it with dirty water, mud, drinks &… so no one had the chance to pour water on him! (He threatened us to pour the bottle on anyone who soaks him!) I gathered that Ava was the one who soaked the most & that’s because the Poetess betrayed her! She took Ava to waterfall to pour water on Teddy I guess, but then she & Pat started pushing her through water… I could hear her shouting: Help me! Help me Teddy! Then Teddy told her that he was going to help; he took her up & put her right through the water!!! She was dripping when she comes down. I wonder how come she didn’t catch cold! Although he missed the class, Pat heads home as soon as we gave the poetess her gifts. He didn’t even wait to have the cake! (That was really strange though.) Mr. President & Lollypop went away with him. As a matter of fact we didn’t feel like getting back so we sat ourselves down over tea & cake & we played cards till it was I think, 5:30… it was getting late so we packed up & drove back to town! Mat dropped Mooshi & the Southerner in one of the main squares of Tehran; & we went to a carwash. I think it was 8’oclock or so when at last I got home! The day was great, but left us so exhausted that when we were offered a trip to KASHAN (a city in the middle of Iran which is famous for it’s Rose Water) to watch GOLABGIRI (making of rose water, the roses are picked up & they’re be boiled to extract the essence), we refused!  well the picnic story is over so you see what we do to have fun!

      Tehran usually got dry weather! Most of the time the sun is shining & since April 21st, which falls on “Ordibehesht” in Persian calendar, the air is getting warm & in June it becomes sizzling! Well, for this year (our New Year starts at March 21) we had plenty of surprising rains… I mean I can’t remember that it would rain continually for more than 8 hours in May. The weather is really fine & you can go walking without being concerned about air pollution. I guess I would go out of town to enjoy nice weather. The only problem is I have my leg in plaster cast. My leg is twisted …& it had been in plaster for more than a month but its ok with me! I even went to picnic like this… Thingsiknow asked me what we’re doing here… so I will write about this very picnic I mentioned. By the way you know what days are weekends in Iran? Over here Thursdays & Fridays are weekends!  I have class on Saturdays, Sundays, Wednesdays & Thursdays. One Tuesday, which is in the middle of the week & so every body’s at work, we set off to a picnic outside of Tehran in AFJEH. It was about 8 when Mat picked me up at my door. (‘Cos my leg was like that he come up to our flat & took my packed things to his car.) He’s got a grayish black Pride (which is a car brand if you don’t know). We waited in front of the buildingfor a while for Mooshi to show up. & as she appeared we got in the car & went to pick another friend up (who I may call southerner.) we called Ava to remind her to buy soft drinks & drove to the place we was to meet others. Lollypop was next to join us. He didn’t take his car so he joined Pat when he arrived. (Pat’s car is a white Opel CORSA.) Mr. President was with him, too. I guess I forgot to tell you that it was the Poetess birthday gathering. She, Ava & the Poetesses’ sister were with Teddy. (He’s got a black Patrol.) They were late & their cell phones were unreachable! At last when they showed up, we got that the delay was due to soft drinks they were to buy… We started the trip at 9:30 I think. At first we wanted to go to ABNIK where there is a Plato & I could sit & get there easily, when we were passing the guard of town Pat waved them good bye & they thought we knew them somehow. I was very delighted, we were like a family going to picnics & every thing was so calm & we’ve had really good time. Mat drives very fast but he drove carefully (‘cos we were 3 girls in his car who may scream! Just kidding!) Pat is a careful driver, & he drives stylishly; though he was so slow that day. We pulled aside some time in order to buy stuff & it was about 10:30 or so when we got to ABNIK… God! The road was blocked by stones ‘cos of flood so we had to drive back & find another place… In the car, we mostly talked about Men & Women & traditional Iranian way of thinking like we were in a class.  Meanwhile we stopped some where to check if I could get there… it was rather steep so I thought we might find better place! So Teddy decided we could go to AFJEH were he knew some place there… the place was well, to be honest, rather difficult to climb! At first I get off the Pride & Ava drove me in Patrol a bit higher…, and then I had to get off again & climb myself. Did I ever tell ya how proud I am? I didn’t let anyone to help me so I climbed the first part without help then I had to cross a narrow pond of water where a short waterfall was falling & to make it perfect I should go down again to a flat area where we could sit. It was the hardest part; even if I hadn’t my leg in plaster, I couldn’t do it… so Mr. President went down first & Pat heads down with his face to me, in order to catch me if I fell… (Mr.Persident was taking care of him.) I don’t know how I got there at last but if I’d fallen, all three of us would get hurt… to be continued

      My, like it was not enough that I couldn't connect to internet, now I can not use the phone line at all.... 3 days with no phone... seems like hell. I mean what if I didn't have the cell phone?  It made me think that how life was without phones? Ever since I was born, my family had accessed to telephone & I gathered it had become a very important part of our lives. How can I chat with Ava if there would be no phone? She lives almost 45 minutes away from my house so it's kind of impossible to talk in person! The point is you're not supposed to have a one hour trip to chat for half an hour.... Beside some times it’s easier to say something on the line than to say it looking in the eyes (like goodbyes).  Well, enough of me nagging! Monday is Eid e Ghorban or Adha as you may know it. It’s like the biggest holiday in Islamic countries. There are some traditions that I won’t go through them now. & there is a myth about Abraham & Ishmael & the miracle that happened in such a day.... If you like to know more I will find some links to put here as soon as I got accessed to internet to search.  I was supposed to go on a short trip this weekend but unfortunately a far relative of mine passed out last Saturday & we had to attend the funeral &.... Last weekend I went on another short trip to Mashhad (a holy city in east part of Iran). The weather was rainy but the travel worth it. Right now dad is planning another trip to visit nearby city of Kashan to purchase some carpets for my aunt! I always thought Tabriz carpets are the most beautiful ones but my aunt thinks a silk Tabrizian carpet is way too expensive for bedrooms. What I don't really get is why they are going to buy the carpet in Kashan? It's not like we can't find Kashan carpet in Tehran! Yes and its Fajr ten-days... the national ceremony for the 79 revolution. I find it rather boring & a bit exaggerating. It IS full of propaganda.... To be honest I don't think I like monarchy; the fact that one person gain a JOB & leadership of SUBJECTS by birth is really ridiculous & what's more why people should supply someone's life because he is the King? So the revolution was somehow inevitable but back at 1979 folks knew what they didn't want but they didn't pay attention to what they wanted... & it led us here! Ok! No politics! My personal political views are kind of strange & this blog is not the place to discuss them. Life is easy & cheerful as always & let it be. Cheers for now.  Ps: I'll be back soooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnn!

      That's a long long story! Some time ago my internet access cut short because of some technical problem in the server.... Then I checked my blog & found out there has been no commenting system! Well, it seems that BlogSpeak is down & moved to some other sites so I have to register my comments again! Right after that my phone line wires got I-dont-know-what! This means I cannot connect to internet through my room's wires! & the idea of moving my pc to another room seems impossible (then how can I work till late in the night?).... So right now I'm using a public computer to access World Wide Web. But THE PHONE LINE WILL BE FIXED SOON or at least I hope so! There are a lot of new subjects about Tehran I just figured hat would be interesting. Just wait a little bit more & I'll write about them.... What are they? Hmmmm? The first is wedding customs: the Tehranian way of the custom is different with other part of the country. Joyriding will be another subject I may discuss. You see it's one of the so many ways young people have fun over here.  Changing the capital from Tehran to another city is what I must write about. Folks over here have different view about moving & all.... There are some things that I won't write about! The first one is "The sit-in of parliament by deputies"! & the next is election! Well, I'm not going to participate in this kind of unfair election & all he discussions wont change anything. The only cure for this wound is to change the overseer congress members in next election (If more legible candidates would BE able to participate!)  Enough for now. I'll be back soon....

      If there would something I can't do over here is finding my way in streets of Tehran! I know some parts of the city too well but as for other parts well I don't think without a map I can find my way home!!!! (Some time even maps can't help!) Now imagine me guiding by another naïve person over some UNKNOWN streets! Here goes the story: me & a friend (miss poetess if you remember) had to go to a funeral & her car was broke so we decided we would take my dad's instead! God know driving in Tehran is a difficult task, hectic traffic & all the rule breakings.... & just add the rain & you got a total mess! Anyway I picked her up & we started cruising... careful not to damage the car! An hour later the only place we couldn't locate was the place of funeral! Obviously we couldn't find it by our own so miss poetess called another friend to help.... The only thing he did was to confuse us even more! Guess what we crossed the same street 4 times before we could find a way out! At last we decided to go home leave the car & take taxi!  The taxi driver didn't know where the place was so again we were where we started… the place was no where to find! So I called another friend & guess what? The place name WAS WRONG! We had been looking for a masque that had been IN FORNT us all the time!

      Alright what birthdays are like in my country? Fun! This word describe every birthday all over the world. Yet there are different ways of celebrating the occasion.  Over here in Tehran we celebrate our birthdays in different ways.... First there are parties (which in fact is my least favorite one)! It could be some family parties or friends. & usually it's in the evening 5 to 11 or longer. It may last till 2-3 am. Cakes & candles & gifts are the essential part of them. When I was younger I used to have big bashes for my birthdays. The tradition is like this: the first step is sending invitation cards to your guest. Usually hey are handed manually & you will have words in order to know how many people are able to make it. Then you have to prepare the foods & snacks & you know all this decorations with color papers, balloons, the funny hats and all the usual birthday stuff. Cake is ordered to be ready for the night.  The evening of birthday party guest would show up around 7 to 9 & there would be dances & dare-devil or other kind of games then there would be inner (if you intend to have a diner party) & the last things are the tradition of blowing the candles & cutting the cake & unwrapping the presents. Most of parties will be over after that. But some others will linger and you may party al night long! This was almost the good part yet when I think of the mess which should be cleaned the day after.... just forget about it! I felt exhausted for a week!  The other way which I prefer is small family gathering. Tâ€™s cool when you got home & there is a small cake & flowers waiting for you. No dances which suits me fine & few beloved people who cherish you for you yourself not for the party you've thrown. Well, in my family there is a tradition of reading poems like hafiz.  Still there is some other ways like surprise parties which is not much different from the one I told ya. Another one is fiends hang out (that could be by plan or surprise). So far it had been the most preferred way among young people. You know throwing a party is kind of hard 'cos most of us live with our parents & arranging a plan without bothering them, is almost impossible. So we choose the easier way.... You choose a date & place & everybody will get over there. Someone will buy the cake & candles & you will have something in the cafÃ© &.... There are different ways of paying for the birthday gathering. Some people have the birthday guy to pay (instead of 5he gifts as they say!) some other would pay for the guy as a gift & shares the other bill. We have another way... we share no matter whose birthday it is & there would be gifts as well. Actually I don't like the idea of gifts! Last year I & Mooshi had one birthday party & this year I just dismissed the idea of me having a hang out so we wouldn't have to go out 4 times in a week! Although I had a very pleasant surprise birthday hang- out with my CLC class pals.  Guess itâ€™s enough for now. Tomorrow will be Mooshi's birthday & I don't want to look sleepy @ all!  Lets face the day with laughter....

      Gone! A wonderful day... three surprises & lots fun... are gone! But the memory remains! The love I've been given, the fact that Ava & Katrine remembered my birth hour & the truth that there are people out there to support me will keep me through another year.  Every year I feel wow this was the best birthday ever! & every year I find more excitement. Happy New Year! Happy birthday & welcome to a new year... there is a change! In a mater of a second I've grown into being 24! & it started great! This is strange... how people affect your life & how in a middle of a disaster you can find time for your own happiness. Am I to selfish 'cos I actually enjoyed my birthday while there are thousands dead, injured or lost in my country? This had happened although it was not completely earthquake-free, I managed to be happy. (Alright I had to explain to any one who called that the gathering is donating some money to earthquake victims & ask if they wanted to join in or not. But it was ok! No corps; no victims; NO TV) I know I promised to write about Tehranian birthdays more. But it's not a good time! Believe me I'm beat right now. I've been out 7h non stop & then I had some guests & its 2a.m. just wanted to say  happy New Year  & ask for your prayers for the souls of dead. May 2004 be the year of friendship & peace. & may we learn that love can heal every wound....

      When you live in Iran politic is part of your daily life. How can one avoid traffic or politics living in Tehran? Today (Monday February 23, 2004) Majlis or parliament had its first public session &   Mrs. Haghighatjoo MP   announced that the election had not been fair & the members had been elected by  order . She is the first Mp whose resignation was discussed and her words caused chaos and you know what happened.... surprisingly the TV showed it all!!!!!!! Somehow she is right. Ava told me in a mosque the preacher told people to vote for  Abadgaran  the right wing conservatives with hard-line Islamic point of views & they have won the election hands down. I didn't vote & I know some friends had voted because of the masc. exam and they had not written any names. It's been said that 28% of people in Tehran had been participating in election & the number for Poldokhtar (a city in west of Iran) is  101% !!!!!!!! You see.... Right now no one knows what is going to happen when the conservatives gain complete control over here. They already have the judgment system and they have won the parliament & basically it is predictable that they are going to win the next presidential election because the majority of people are who support reformists are disappointed due to   "law framework  " president Khatami insist on. One thing is for sure if conservatives try to restrict this already limited freedom we have, it will lead to a serious action. But what it would be? No body really thinks about that. Alright... let's hope bright future!

      My family always travel a lot more than what others do over here. While most of people I know had not seen more than 2 or 3 cities in Iran, I had the chance to visit at least tow-third of the country. Still there are so many places left that I want to visit.... Being a vast country, Iran got lots of sight-seeing; natural & historical. It's got amazingly diverse cultures & varied traditions.  Most of the time, we travel by our own car. It's more convenient & you got to see more sight-seeing. Usually we set a city as a base & then go around checking other nearby cities.... It's like we take short trips not long travels. & sometime we take the opportunity of a tow day holiday or just a weekend to visit a nearby city.  Like this weekend we set off to the north part of Iran to seaside. This is a four-hour trip from Tehran to Motel-Ghoo (a tourist-city by seaside) & folks often go there in summer & finding a good place to stay will be really hard. It will be packed with tourists.... But as in the winters, Motel-Ghoo is rather isolated & only local residents & few people who have mansions there could be seen around.  Although we had been warned that the weather might be gloomy & it may rain, the sun was shining for most part of the day & only it snowed on mountains.... So we had very nice (and cold of course) weather. And the sea was so beautiful & wavy; there was no chance of swimming however not even in the pool. Yet me & my cousin went for a walk along the beach & I took off my shoes & stood in the waves.... The only sound was the sound of waves crashing the shore & the only other creatures were a seabird hovering over the water & my cousin who had been on the phone whispering words to his ladylove. It was so peaceful & quite... it seemed nothing would be able to destroy the magnificence & magic of the moment. It is unbelievable how people ruin the beauty of places. In the summer time you just see crowded seashore & cars & there is no privacy at all... even in private beaches your privacy is invaded by the noise & ignorant people.  Great time still the joy of being back home is greater.... Take from me, Tehran is the most beautiful place I have ever been in my life.

      Well; we have this windy days that are some kind of strange for Tehran. I mean we are not used to strong winds which would blow everything & all. Tehran most of the time is caressed by gentle breezes like tender hands of a mother.... But lately it seems that the storm beats the city!  The other night the wind was so strong I thought my window would break into pieces; but I was too tired to get up & sleep somewhere else my bed is by the window!) & I figured if it actually breaks, I would stay in my bed till my dad comes & cleans the shattered glass... :D good it never broke! And today while I was walking down the street, the wind was leading me.... And as I got home the antenna on a neighbor roof broke & fell on a car! I had never seen something like that! Fortunately there was no one near the car or inside... but the front glass was shattered & the hood totally damaged!  All these happenings don't make me love wind less. Windy weather is like my moody character: unstable; changing; & unpredictable.... It could be strong enough to move you or it might be too delicate for you to even feel it. You may fly with the wind or you may run away from it.... it doesn't really matter; wind is moving you anyway.... & now I’m flying away with the wind.... Where to? I have no idea... when I got there I will let you know.

      Moharam is the first month of Hijri calendar. But unlike other new years, for Sheeiis it is the time of mourning.... Imam Hussein; third religious leader of Sheeii, had been killed in the 10th day of Moharam. So we have some kind of religious ritual during the first 10 days.  The saga of Imam Hussein & the way he & 72 of his loyal devotees had died on the battlefield on Ashoura (10th day of Moharam) is known to every 2 year old Iranian kid. Although it had been exaggerated over past 13 centuries it still holds part of the true story.  During this 10-day event the cities are far too changed from what they usually look like. There are so many places that give away food as vows (which we call Nazri) & some mourning carnivals will be going on.... The ritual had been derived from an ancient ritual of “revenge of Siyavoosh” in old pre-Islamic era.     Siyavoosh had been the handsome son of keykavoos the emperor of Iran. He had been beheaded by Afrasiab the king of Tooran (Rival country of Great Iran) who happened to be his father in law. & his son Keykhosro took his revenge by killing Afrasiab (myth of Siyavoosh; Shahnameh; Ferdowsi). He had been one of the most beloved mythic characters in Persian myths & the ritual of his revenge had been held widely before Islam. Then when Imam Hussein died, according to the fact that he himself as well as his father Imam Ali was widely appreciated, the ritual turned to some means of protest against the Arab Government ruling Iran at the time. (No offence to all those Arabs out there, but that's the truth historically & I personally don't have anything against them.)  In this event there is this play called Ta`zieh which narrate the saga of the battles on Ashoura & Tasoua (day 9th). It originally played by men & even the female role of Zeiynab (Imam Hussein's sister) or other ladies on the battlefield is played by men. But recently there are few plays which are played by women as well as men. Ta`zieh is played on the streets or in the mosques but there is no need to for any stages & sometime a whole street is the stage for the actors. They are not paid for the role they playing & most of the time there is no rehearsal for the play. They just learn the words through each year play. So this acting job is kind of art which must be learned since childhood. One grows from being a soldier to being Imam or Aboulfazl or Shemr.  Shemr is the wicked fighter who'd killed Imam... so playing his role is the most difficult one. I had been studying acting when I was teenager & I dare say this role is too complicated to be played by some newcomers... so the most experienced actor will play shemr. He is wicked, strong, and knowledgeable & at the same time he loves Imam & he knows what he is about to do... he even cries when he kills Imam.... I had seen some powerful overwhelming acts that made me forget all around me & feel that I'm looking really at the scene in Karballa - the battlefield.  The greatest play is the one for Ashoura's noon.... There would be all these tents & horses & it tells the story of Hussein being killed.... You won’t believe the atmosphere in this play. Every audience has his own role in this play. You may never notice but you yourself will be part of the play... you cry, you shout & chant... if you are interested in folklore, Moharam is the time to come over here.  The mourning carnivals would be chanting, singing battle songs, dancing grievous moves & there'd be all these flags & A`lams (the big metal or wooden big tree-shaped thing decorated with metal balls & cloths & feathers &... as means of signs)... it really look like old army troops setting out to fight! And at last at Ashoura sunset there would be the candle light mourning tradition where things are quiet... because the battle is over & the caravan of prisoners consisting of ladies & kids & sick Imam Sajad (the only man still alive though very sick) is moving to Shaam to meet Yazid the ruler. Unfortunately I'm not a good narrator & if you are not acquainted with the tradition this post will not help you at all! I will try to find some links on this part but for now why don't you take a look at  urlLink Borrowed Ideas; Persian Roots of Christian Traditions . You may find it amazing....

      Yes! It's valentine! Well, traditionally we don't have valentine day. But the tradition of valentine is growing really fast over here. I remember back at 5 years ago, guys would wonder when I would talk about valentine but now it seems every Tom, Dick and Harry know about it!  Well, I gathered its part of western culture that is spreading among my generation over here. I don't know if it's good or bad but it is what happening & we can't close the doors on other cultures. I only wish some day people around the world would celebrate MEHREGAN or YALDA or NOROOZ the way they celebrate valentine.  So what do folks do on valentine day here? Well, I really don't know! I mean I had never been on a valentine date before. Although when some old friends of mine had been in Iran they used to send me anonymous cards & stuff. & I used to do the same but as I said those days no one else knew about valentine! & to think about it we where only 14! Then 6 years ago they moved to France & we kind of lost contact. Still every birthday & valentine I got cards.  Yeah, folks... they tend to go on dates & you know if you want to make sure there is room for you in a specific place, then you have to book it in like 4 days time. & God knows that suddenly teddy prices sores up & flowers & candies become favorite part of shopping. Oh, yeah and the candle light dinner & all other things.... But as I said; it not my place to talk about it.  Any way happy valentine day.

      One of my best friends P the Pampering is flying away to Germany for a six-month training course.... He had been waiting for this for at least 6 months and we had been talking about it endlessly. But now that it's happening; well, I kind of feel overwhelmed & I can't help but to think that I'm loosing a supporter & I feel alone. All through the last 2 years we have gone through so much together. I understand that it's time to let go & that I have to stand alone & face my own battle (as he is fighting his own).  The hardest part is saying the words.... It makes it so final, so real. As far as you have not said GOODBYE, there is hope to have him for another day. So we both deliberately avoid this moment of uttering the word. But then there is no choice, is there? He will be gone & the friendship will be changed forever. Let’s encounter it.... we're off to experience our life & that's a good point. Maybe when he comes back we would find it worthwhile....  Alright! Goodbye & let's keep the memories good or bad, happy or sad. And may God help us in our way....

      New Year or Norooz is here at last. Norooz means new day in Persian & it’s the first day of Farvardin. & Farvardin is the first month of spring over here. So one expects it to be sunny & warm but this year instead it was snowy & white. We believe that whatever the mood is in the beginning of the year it will last all through the year…. So I guess we’ll have a nice cool year! I will write more on the subject of New Year customs & the fortnight of Norooz really soon. But right now you may go check the links below.  urlLink norooz  &  urlLink haftsin  good luck...

      Well Chaharshanbe-Soori means Wednesday party in Persian; but actually it is being held on last Tuesday-night of the year. This night, unlike Yalda, is not a family gathering... it’s more like an outdoor night with friends if you know what I mean.  Tonight is Chaharshanbe-Soori… & believe me it’s the coldest one I have seen over years. Actually the weather changes had been rather unexpected here. We had some really warm days & most people turned off the heat providers & put aside the winter clothes. Then suddenly it started to get cold again & the rain started on Saturday…. Well it was ok but Sunday it got colder & Monday morning I got up & the whole city was covered with snow! Hopefully it stopped snowing this very afternoon yet it is VERY cold outside for this time of the year (about -1`C; while the average for this time is around 12`C)  What we do on Chaharshanbe-Soori? Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you…. The festival begins almost after then sunset… teenagers & young boys & girls make large fires outdoors. We, as me & my sister along with our next-door pals, usually have small fire in the yard. Then everybody jumps over the fire & sings the Fire poem, wishing to for all the pain to burn with the fire & happiness warm us up like the fire. We usually perform dance moves while we are jumping…. It’s so much fun. Then we would have potatoes & sausages roast in the fire & all kind of snack foods….  This part is the main part of Chaharshanbe-Soori but over the years, another part had been developed that is not originally a custom of Chaharshanbe-Soori but it is so common that nowadays you can not avoid it. & that is the firework part as I may call it. There would be all kinds of firecrackers with loud sounds & also fireworks which are really beautiful. The sound of firecrackers however is not very pleasant yet most young people love to set them off! & if you are walking or riding in the street you must be prepared for some to set off right under your foot!  Chaharshanbe-Soori had been banded over the past 25 years & it is the first year that it is officially held by government. Still like pervious years the anti-riot police arrest some young men in the neighborhood…. I don’t know much but I guess this festival had become a mean to show our protest against limits & boundaries. You know we go hang out in the neighborhood with more freedom than usual & you can see people dancing by fires & the music blasting & all. Tehran turns to a club in this night. & that is not inside the frame we are supposed to live in. I like the feeling of freedom in the air… (Although you have to watch for this police forces); still there is so much fun just cruising around. You see we get out & everybody is into a party mood. It almost never happens that you play dare-devil or truth or dare in the street. & more you never find this kind of unity in folks. It doesn’t matter where you are from, what you are wearing or what you do for living, the only thing that matters is you & the fact that you want to enjoy the night.  Personally I am not much into the whole going-out part… because first of all I hate loud noises & second some dare-devil games really bother me, you know the way some pathetic guys try to draw attention by taking really stupid dares…. But I have no chance of staying home, having an out-going sister along with my twin cousins. However this time I managed to stay in the doorway while they were playing tow doors away. :D  There was this large fire on the corner of the street & almost everybody in the block was there. & there was tow imaginary rival groups fighting with firecrackers & all…. I had been too tired (from Khoonetekooni) to join in but then this old friend of mine came over & almost dragged me in the battle-field! I stayed a few minutes & as soon as he let go of me I went back home. Then the police forces rushed in & folks went to the yard of the building. Beside that everything went fine.  I wanted to show you how we really celebrate the end of the winter. Sure there are more customs for Chaharshanbe-Soori like Ghashogh-zani (in which somebody mostly kids hidden under chador knock on every door & ask for sweets & Ajil & wishes happiness & fortune for the folks in the house) & Falgoosh (which means eavesdropping to find hints about your future or hear you future partner’s name), although they are not really practiced these days. Last time I’d seen ghashogh-zani was over 15 years ago. & as for Falgoosh I myself did it once when I was 14! Me & my cousin stood in a dark corner of our street & my cousin’s boyfriends passed by & shout his own name for my cousin! He said Aatish (my cousin’s nickname) you are going to be my spouse one day! How embarrassed we both were. Alright! Gotta go catch some sleep now! It is like 3am over here!

      Tehran is a really noisy city. I mean it’s never quite even in the middle of the night you can still hear noises & it is much worst in the main streets…. Well, not that I don’t like it, I even find it appealing, but still there’s time that you need to go to a quite place…. I’m living up the main street of Tehran & my place is in the middle of tow highways & this very main street; so you say it, silence is a luxury to me. Tehran is hilly & most streets have slight slopes… & I happen to live up on a hill. (You know a friend of mine who lives in Netherlands always says you live on a high mountain! But well, to me it is only a little hill.)  I’m sure you are wondering what these tow subjects have to do with each other. Well, in just 5 minutes walk from my house, down the Doostan (friends) valley is an old small park, where the only thing you can hear is the birds singing & the wind blowing. It is not like you are just 10 minutes away from a highway at all. & you know the whole area had maintained the style & texture over the years; the large houses & the way you can walk down the street & kids riding bicycles & happy couples who shares a nice afternoon tea together…. I just love the way it is here! Most of the neighborhood had basically lived over here for the past 20 or more years, so most faces are familiar & you always get a friendly nod passing someone. It’s like a really small town in this specific area…. Living here all my life, I had never paid attention to these little facts & subsequently I’m not surprised when I occasionally bump into ladies who are standing out doors talking to each other without scarves or Hijab of any kind (for a short time of course). Although to some of my friends it seems rather strange when I do the same thing.  So whenever I want to have a little time to myself, I just put on my favorite walking shoes & go down to this park. & I look at all these beautiful houses & I start making stories about them. Some of them had been wiped out & new multi-story buildings are growing fast. Well, I am not too happy about that. New-comers can change the overall mood of the area, but changes are inevitable….  Ah; I just wanted to tell you about this very nice place & I guess I babbled on once again. & hey it’s new year in a week!

       I meant to ask you something & I want you to answer me honestly. Do you think I have changed *a lot* in the past few months? I mean do you think that you don’t know me at all? Do you feel like I have been replaced by someone else?  I know I am changing, growing up or whatever you may call it & I know it’s not for best…. What I’m saying is lately it seems that all I do is wrong & that I don’t have time for my friends. & as time passes by I feel that my morals are transforming into something nobody but myself understands. I’m afraid of growing up, if it means all this changes. & I am not ready for this… anything that it might be.

      We have this custom which we call khoonetekooni.... It means house shaking in word by word translation. But actually it is a tradition of cleaning the house completely before the New Year (Norooz) comes.  This is rather because we believe that you go through the year the way you started it.... it means if you have a clean house at the exact time of new year, you are supposed to have a clean one all through the year. Or you will be doing whatever you are doing at the moment of New Year. That's a generally accepted belief & who dares to say someone's belief is superstition?  Remind me to explain a bit more about Persian calendar.... It is really interesting & that’ll explain about the seasons & all! What does really khoonetekooni means? What we do for house cleaning? Basically you wash & clean everything in the house. It usually takes the whole Esfand (last month of the year) for us to do the cleaning. Because my parents are both working & well, my dad doesn't like us to have maids in the house. (He has some strange ideas about social ranking & ... he believes that while we are healthy enough to do the cleaning & renovations, there is no need to have someone does it.)  During this month the walls will be washed & if they would need painting, they will be painted. All the windows would be totally sparkling & spotless. The extra dishes –which are not probably used all year round- would be rinsed & re-located in their cupboards & cabinets. The cabinets, dressers & closets are all cleaned. Even the attic would be unsoiled & reorganized. The carpets are swabbed & they sometimes they would even be rinsed.  I dare say the worst part of house cleaning is washing the curtains! You know they must be washed, rinsed, hang down to dry & then ironed! After that it takes a whole day to hang them back on the place! Mom always says we live in glass house... the saloon alone has got five usual windows & 3 French windows & need 25m of cloth for one set of curtains... you see? To my relief, we have bought a new set of curtains that will be delivered in the last week of the year so we don't have to go through the usual curtain-washings!  Most of the time, the decoration of the house is changed by rearranging of the furniture. I, myself, change my room decorations every year by using new set of sheets & matching curtains. I also move my bed, desk & bookcase around the room. So my room-cleaning is usually the longest & most time-consuming of them all, if we dont count the kitchen. The easiest one is terrace, I guess. The only thing to be done is to swab & wash the floor & set the chairs around the table.  I love this season... the mood of cleaning & waiting for the New Year. It always makes you want to do something, to change & renew your surrounding. Katherine always says the air smells like khoonetekooni! I think she is right. A few days ago, I was walking down the street & I suddenly felt that I should dance instead of walking. It's the weather & the mood of New Year. I will right more about this mood. & yeah; there is the  urlLink Festival of Fire (Chahar-Shanbeh Soori)  in tow weeks.... Life is wonderful!

      Well, isn’t that strange I had not written anything in a month! I had been busy studying. There is going to be an exam in tow weeks & I really got down studying a little more.  Spring time is always busy for me. Over here in Iran, the New Year begins with spring & so the first month is totally hectic. You know we have this custom of visiting relatives during the first tow weeks (holidays) of the New Year & most people arrange to go on a vacation during this fortnight so this DID-VA-BAZDID (which means visiting relatives) always draws out through the first month of spring. Being blessed by having a large family (!) there are still some people I have to visit! Sometimes it turns to a torture when you are obliged to visit some far-relatives, but most of the time it’s fun. This spring the weather has been unusually unpredictable. It had been sunny one minute & then it would rain cats & dogs. You never know what to wear when you are going out. What’s more ridiculous is the fact that you may wear a sweatshirt & it would suit the weather when you head out but when you’re heading back you might find the sun burning up & ….  Still spring is the most probable time to go out & have a picnic. We tend to spend our weekends over the mountains at my aunts mansion & there is this little spring over there I usually hang around it. You know it is located between the rocks & there is a rock, with very flat surface which is called SHAHNESHIN (dais rock), almost hanging over the foundation of the spring & wow there is a tree with branches stretched out hovering on the rock… it is the perfect place to read books & dream dreams of fairies & elves.  However my favorite spot is located at the far end of the mansion. There is a large throne (ARIKEH) set in a Persian style under the cherry trees. You know the kind you may have seen in movies with a carpet & cushions all over it & there are 2 love seats placed on both sides. & the set is located on a higher level (kind of on a larger step…) so you can reach up & have a cherry if you want. & most of the time it is isolated due to the fact that it is far from the spring so if I would need solitude I will walk up there & I will lay down & relax. There I am Scheherazade the storyteller queen & I write poems & all. Well a good friend of mine always teases me about being romantic about this special place. It’s typical of him to tell everyone I will accept anybody’s proposal over there!  Those tow place are really cool to hang out during the day but when the night falls down I rather stay close to the main building so I’d go sit on this large swing overlooking the veranda where everybody else stays. It is really comforting to hear the music of them talking…. Now… I just wanted you to know how it is like for me to spend my weekends in Iran getting away from the city I love for a day. It is really soothing to escape the busy everyday life & take a short trip although the car drive takes nearly 3 hours yet it worth it.

      It was the first time in 15 years that I spent the whole 2-weeks holiday in Tehran… usually we travel around the country in Eid Norooz holiday but this time we decided to stay in town & my dad went to South with my aunts.  Tehran is seldom quiet & rarely got clean weather but you should have seen it during the past fortnight. It was amazingly fresh & calm like the way it should be… no traffic; no sound pollution. Heaven should be like Tehran in holidays! However the weather is somehow odd. It had been raining cats & dogs & it dropped to 0`C, then out of the blue the sun started shining & all. Well, we thought it had gone back to normal weather but it started to rain again! Don’t get me wrong I love rainy days yet weather changes are so fast, I can’t remember the last time it had been like this over here.  Alright must get back to study a bit. But I will write about 13-bedar soon.

      Oh my God! I just don’t know how I can explain what I feel now.... well, first of all,  we are all kicking & alive & over here in Tehran  there had not been a soul loss reported, although in some parts the electricity is cut off.  But it was a rather frightening experience; the earthquake was about 5.5 grades & it lasted for a good 2 minutes. Last great earthquake here was about 4 grades & it lasted only 30 seconds.... so I guess you can say that this time it seemed more intense.... It’s been told that a French source has announced a 6.2 degree for the earthquake. We don’t know yet if it is true or not.  We don’t know if there had been damages in other areas either, we know that only one person had passed away in GHAZVIN.  Why this earthquake was so frightening although the damage was not much? I guess the time of the occurrence was an important factor. For all other earthquakes, most people were asleep & didn’t feel anything. But for this one  (5:10 pm)  people got really frightened & they mostly ran out of their houses in the street. Another point in this matter is the fact that the Bam earthquake is still fresh in the memories of people. & the fact that earthquake has been one of the most frequent discussion topics, had its own effect. You see only few posts back, I wrote about earthquake training..... Well, I should get going. If anything new happens, you will be informed.  Ps: last news: 5 killed; 20 injured.

      This is kind of strange.... it had been a year I started bloging! Wow! Look how much I have changed over the past year! I definitely grew up (which is not a good thing) & I made fabulous friends (which is why I keep posting still).  Well, when I started to blog I never knew what I wanted to write about. Mostly I had this intention to change the image of Iranians in some few people who would check my blog. I don’t know how much this goal is accomplished. It is really important for me to know how others think about my country. & I always hated it when I saw the injustice media forcing on this image.  Do you know that when BBC world shows the weather forecasts, on the map, all the countries around Iran are mentioned, but there is nothing about Iran or Tehran? & I’m sure you know that the Persian Gulf is plainly called gulf... like it doesn’t have any names! Have you heard of the world’s largest lake? The Caspian Sea? Do you know that Iranian had been the first nation who ever sail through this lake & we call it KHAZAR...?  I am Iranian & I am proud of the history behind me. I just want to find my place in this new world & this blog was all about that... finding more, learning more.... I hope if someone, who may have once read my blog, met an Iranian somewhere... understand that s/he is a human being. & I’m looking toward the day when this terrorist image of Iranians fades away & instead the image of a welcoming friendly nation would replace this one. My second goal was to show you how we live in Tehran. Tehran... the city I love so much. I don’t even know why I love this city.... Most of the time it is crowded & polluted, yet the few nice days makes it the most beautiful place in the world for me. Right now I’m sitting by my window overlooking south & I can see the plain filled with buildings in front of me. You see, Tehran is surrounded by mountains from 3 sides.... The average height of my city is about 4000 m above the sea level & most of the streets have slight (or sometime sharp) slopes. There is no natural water source inside the city.... I mean, there is no huge river & of course no big lakes... only small springs there & then. So we have some vulnerable geographical position... we can easily be famished! & to make the situation worse there are more than 45 cracks in Tehran which makes it one the most expected area for earthquakes. (Tehran is located on the earthquake belt!)  But my city is so beautiful... not in artistic shape like other large cities or not in historical way like Isfehan or Shiraz; but in its own way. You know Tehran is like a person with casual but comfortable cloths. It spreads wherever it likes & the whole city has the mood of care-free-ness. You know she is always fashionably cheerful... like a kind lady. She is welcoming & forgiving. Anyone can find place to fit in her heart. It doesn’t mater for her who you are or where you are from, she can always take you in & give you what you want. Tehran is no goddess like Shiraz & she is not a b**** like some other cities. She is mother who takes care of you, the lover who nourish your emotions & for sure she is a playful friend. Then again Tehran is the boss behind her casualty, Iran’s life depend on her. It is ridiculous sometime... basically there is no oil in Tehran, no big industry, no mines, no water.... & still we get the best of everything! She is like the queen... she produce much but owns the best.  & yes! This the city I was born & lived in. This is the city I adore.... This city!  Tehran is an example of tolerance. You can find people of any reign in Iran here. They all live together with their different idea & customs under one territory: Tehran.  Alright... don’t you feel sick of me talking about Tehran? I got to go now! But I’ll be back with more on my hometown!  BTW how did you find the pictures?

      Today in Tehran young children who attend kindergartens had a earthquake exercise! There is a Traffic Park in Tehran were this had taken place.  TV showed small kids who were standing in a corner of a shaking box & they were trained to avoid high buildings & each had been given a small bag which could be worn around the neck in which they had their name & address & photos of their parents.  This is what I call improvement. I didn’t get the earthquake training until I was like 8 years old & even then I just had learned oral lessons. It was not until I start being trained for first aid as red-cross volunteer that I actually practiced the rules. You know we were trained in school about first aid & I was like 14! But nowadays 4-year-olds know everything about earthquake.  It is really important in a city like Tehran where there is a high chance for earthquake that kids learn how to deal with it, even if it would seem like a game to them. My 4 year old cousin once told me that if the earth shakes I must run to the corner & don’t try to get downstairs by elevators…. Well, most grown-ups don’t know how to act….

      Well I didn’t get through the Masc. exam…. My rank was 137 & only people who ranked below 133 could get through the first step. Then these people will choose the universities & at least 33 people would enroll in Masc. food engineering program.  Masc. exam is a competitive in which unfortunately our GAP & extracurricular activities are not considered. It is based on a four-choice test. The participants for food engineering were about 5000. So you see the chance of getting in is slim to none.  We have this opportunity to test ourselves in another non-governmental university (Azad). Actually I got my Bs in Research & science unit of this university & there is this chance for me to get through the masc. exam this time. Because I had been a straight a student & actually I got the fifth rank in our faculty so there would be some kind of facilities for me. Yet I really don’t know if I want to participate in it. It will cost a fortune! Alright… let’s forget about it. Tonight I, my sister & Katherine went out to meet some other bloggers. It is sort of strange to meet the real person behind the virtual logger. You know when you read a blog you have this clear image in your head about the writer… then you meet them & bomb! The image is gone forever! I would never go to this kind of gatherings again. Well, I basically knew everybody there but we could not find the right subject to talk. Yet I really liked some girls there & there is this one guy we have really close virtual friendship & he was sort of ok. Ok. Now I got to go & sleep…. Pray for me.  I need it. btw why I can not open lynne's blog?

      I'm dead tired! You would not believe me1 I have a class of 7-12 years-old boys & they are driving me crazy! I spare a lot of energy in their class that when I get home, the only think I can do is to collapse on bed & sleep!  Some of them are really quick & despite their age they learn really fast. However there are not so fast students in my class & when I'm working with them, the other party (the quick students) get bored & you know the rest.... I've a student who does gymnastic practice in my classroom!  I'm not sure what I have gotten myself into... it seems that I'm not a good a teacher. I mean I do fine with my quick students but with the rest... well, it's not easy to be tolerant when you try to teach them "hello! Hello! How are you? I'm fine, thank you & you..." & they don’t get it! My class-agenda was to complete the 'Greeting' & the concept of boy & girl & teacher & student & I should have told them the rules of the class... by the end of session tow, I still had to teach the teacher/student concept! So I decided to add the class time & ask weaker students to come to make-up class.  I hope this would work.  Well... I really had to go to bed now. Wish me luck.

      & no, it is nothing like being a lobbyist or hygiene supervisor in a food factory. Actually this job does not relate to my field of study at all.... I happened to be a teacher now!  Isn't it funny? I studied 4 years to become a food engineer; had been a straight-A student all my life, & now I'm here: teaching kids of 8-11 English! Not that I mind using my not-so-good knowledge of English, but what about all the years I studied?  Basically, over here finding a job related to your field of study is out of the question. Ok no it's not, but you must know someone & then they must introduce you &.... Well, that's the same old story. I had some job offers in food industry but most of them were located over far west borders of Iran & it was really hard for me to pack up & leave my hometown.... Some times I do think that what would have happened if I had accepted one of the offers? I would probably go crazy in a fortnight.   Anyway, I got a job now.... I wish I could teach adults. You know they are more willing to study & the job would not be so crucial. With the kids, one must be very careful. They are quick to learn anything so one mistake & you ruin their chance of learning the correct word forever.  I know this sounds very harsh, yet I had never been interested in children. Kids scare me with their unexpected behavior. However I really don’t see why kids like me. I mean I hardly do anything to attract them, maybe I would wave a hand or smile, but that's it. Yet the kids find it easy to communicate with me. They tend to come & sit by my side or ask me astonishing questions. I guess that's a good point anyhow. OMG, in the class I'm observing thee is this cute 9-years-old girl named ZAHRA; she is a sweetheart although I'm pretty sure she is a bit mischievous. Yesterday her teacher gave the class a 5 minute break & she wanted to go drink some water... in order to impress her teacher, she raised her hand & said "may I CHEATER". You must have seen my friend's face (her teacher) she was trying her best not to laugh. It was really funny! Alright, now I just wanted to announce my new job....  By the way I'm not in good mood! Italy just lost the soccer tournament & they were like my favorite team *Cry*. It is not fair! They played really good! *ooohhhhh*  I hope tonight Germany lose too! They had been playing really bad!  Now I shall get back by my TV set... the match is on!

      Don’t get me wrong; there is no match over here going on. I mean yeah, there is but not important ones.... But some where south Europe in the country of famous José Samarago, Portugal, an event is running by the name of Euro2004! What does it have to do with Iran? Easy; soccer (or the way we call it football) is the first & favorite sport in Iran... so you get it.... During the matches streets of Tehran is nearly empty. For crying out laud, I had not seen a single a car passing by for over an hour now! & everywhere you go there are talks about soccer teams & all. & Iranians being the interpreter & soccer professionals by birth (!) all have speculations; & well, if a coach wants his team to win, the only he's got to do is to take the first flight to Tehran & take taxi & hang around the town for a while & he'll learn more about his team than he could spending day & night with them!  I'm not joking the other day I was in a taxi & tow elderly men were having a conversion about Manchester Unt. & believe me even Sir Alex Ferguson (coach of Manchester Unt.) could not explain the reasons behind the team's relatively failure better! I am a real soccer fan myself. Well, know to think about it I really did not have much of a choice! In my family gatherings, there are always tow main subjects: Politics & Football; & having a mad-about-soccer cousin was not of any help. Despite the fact that my father is a "rational" soccer watcher, both me & my sister have been this hyper watcher as my dad put it.... when we are watching an important match, even an earthquake or volcano eruption would be ignored by us.  So what on earth am I doing writing this stuff while Greek is literally kicking Portugal's butt which happen to be one of my fav teams on this championship? (Sorry for the language, sometimes it's so hard not swear when you are this frenzied; just don’t mind this text!) Well, *rolling eyes* I gathered it is to unnerving for me to watch. I guess you all remember my little tiny sickness back in autumn.... I'm really getting all better you know. Yet my doctor thinks I must take great care & not to get stressed. "Any kind of tension could be lethal" he told me over the phone the other day, although in a joke. But he still asked me to do my best not to get "overjoyed" or "heated"! so as I was watching this match (that I expected Portugal to win hands down) & to my surprise, Greek had them all worked up... well! I decided to stop watching before I would have a nervous break-down in front of TV for all the good opportunities Portugal had missed! So you see, here I am sitting by my monitor... & I can hear the match! For the TV is a bit loud! & it sucks! I guess I get back & watch the rest of the match.... So bye for now! Ps: Portugal totally sucked! I'm so mad! Greek beat them 2-1 & their only goal was in spare time! *flying off the handle* for heavens sake, they're hosting the championship! I really don’t see why Louis Figue had to play this bad! (See this is what I'm talking about... we always get to discuss the details... *:D*) I hope the next match between Spain & Russia would be a good match....

      You wouldn’t believe me! Yesterday the temperature was about 87 f` (36 `c). my it's going to be a long hot summer....  The band is about to go on a picnic but I happen to be out of town this weekend so I can not accompany them. Well, that's not too bad if you ask me. I'm going to the mansion I told you before... so thee is no point in complaining.  A friend of mine is coming back to Iran. She's been oversees over the past decade so it is kind of strange for us to meet. You know last time we met each other we were 14 now I'm 24. I don’t know if we can maintain the friendship we had before or not. I'm really scared. But I'll manage that....  The ridicules point is that there is the new airport opening here & all foreign flights must land there.... yet the first flight which actually landed there had encountered some problems & so airport usage is indefinitely delayed! However my friend had been told that she is going to land in this new airport! Then she has too take taxi to another airport (Mehrabad airport) to take another flight to Shiraz to see her relatives. She will be back to spend a few days with me at the end of June.  I'm wondering how anyone shall manage to get to the other airport for taking another flight. It takes about 3 hours to travel between the tow! I mean the new airport is far off the east-south of Tehran & the Mehrabad airport is located in the west-south. So I hope the new airport would not be open when my friend arrives. At least it would save her much time & energy.

      For heaven's sake, they are still panicking over earthquake. Since the earthquake of North, there had been all these rumors saying that there will a drastic one in Tehran & the fact that venues is going to pass across the sun has something to do with that! Well, I know very little about astrology & much less about earthquakes but come on! If we think a bit rationally then there would be no need to panic! I mean yes, there is a great chance of an earthquake happening over here but the time is not predictable.  We should be prepared but not for a special amount of time! You would not believe me but actually some students spent some night out in the campus yard & refused to sleep in their dorms! Some of them had left the dorm & went back to their hometown! You see!  Ok. I had to do for now. But don’t you forget to check out the event of Venous cruising in front of sun on Tuesday. It wont happen in 120 years time!

       I'm still in a shock.... she died in a car accident with her husband. &amp; I think how fate can do this to the most perfect, in-love couple. How this could happen to people with so many dreams yet to be accomplished? I'll be alright in a while; my friends will be alright too. But their parents will never be the same again. I wish there could be something to be done. I wish this pain could subsided, that the wound of loss could be healed

      OOpps! I knew what SALOON mean in English! but I was too tired to notice my mistake. In French & also In Farsi Saloon is a big Hall where you can fit many people @ once & there are seats &.... what I meant by saloon was this kind of a room. a hall, or a waiting room, you know the kind that leads to a coridor & all other parts of the bulding... & thanks for correcting my mistake. It meant a lot to me.

      Well, I still have problem with my hyper student but the others are adapting themselves easily with my method. I used to review all the last sessions in the beginning of the class so my student would get into the mood for a new English lesson & then I would teach the new material & repeat it.  But now that I started teaching alphabet & letters, I changed my timing schedules. I teach the oral part (like the concept of family or colors or...) after a short review of the related subjects; then I would teach letters (which happens to be my students' favorite part). & at last I ask questions student by student & check their handwritings & we discuss their problems. This usually takes more time than expected so I take my student to saloon & as soon as they're done, they can go home. Most of my students prefer to stay in the saloon & do their home work while I'm asking questions.  A very huge obstacle in teaching English to youngsters is the fact that most of them are forced to come to the classroom. I mean they can't figure why they are learning a foreign language & our reasons (like oversee travels or computers) don’t satisfy them.  Oh yeah; I must tell you.... I guess I have to teach for the next couple of months! Let's see if I can get adapted or what!

      I really don’t know if the management should get involve in every _ I mean every!_ detail of every class or what?  For the past 2 weeks I had difficulties with one of my students... he is a bit hyper & I really can't control him. He is 7 years old & I thought he would do better in a lower level with less discipline in the classroom, since he is always standing in the middle of the class & he never pays attention to what I'm saying. So I had a talk with management & her mother was there to make a decision about him attending my class. & the result is he is staying. Well, I really don’t want to get into the details but my boss spend the whole time of last session in my class repeating the lesson for him! & well, unfortunately, she had never taught English & she kept meddling with teaching telling my students what to do. Then she told me that I was "say to much 'be quite' or 'why are you talking" in the classroom!  I really don’t like it when people who don’t have the actual knowledge tell me what to do. I asked to divide my class into tow classes so I could have more time with my students. It was rejected. So I asked them to find a sub teacher for the class.  I think I should have never tried for the teaching job! But anyway I learned something & that's the best of the experience; so there is nothing to regret. I never thought I would give up so easily. I used to fight for the things I would start. If I had any doubt, I would not start something but this once.... Well, I'm going to spend the rest of my days as a teacher with a new method. I hope it would work....  The only thing I wish is my students would remember me as a nice teacher. That's all for now. I have class tomorrow... pray for my nerve.

        Unlike other countries, going to a movie hall is not very popular between Iranians. Most people I know prefer to watch a DVD at home than to go to the movies. It's cheaper; & more comfortable. Still, this doesn’t mean that we don’t watch movies. A movie hall is a cool place to hang out for a while. Most young couples find movie halls a good place for spending some time together, holding hands &amp;.... but I must admit that I really don’t like to go to a movie hall with my gang; to be honest, we are so noisy & loud that we often get some hushes during the movie. Movie theaters over here are not very cozy &amp; facilitated. This could be a reason that folks don’t like to spend their time there. Most of the time, some thing is wrong or out of order. Another reason could be the fact that the price is a bit high. & of course folks choose to watch a movie at home when they can pay one-tenth of the price for a better movie.... Yet, when a good movie like MARMOOLAK (the lizard) is released, you must book your seats a weak ahead if you don’t want to miss it; alright at least if you want to watch it a good movie hall. Farhang is one of the best movie halls over here in Tehran. It had been renovated & refurnished. The movie hall is very friendly &amp; welcoming & another point that makes it popular is the fact that you can watch latest foreign (English &amp; non-English) movies in their original languages (Which is a very important factor for me when I choose a movie). Farhang is located on SHARIATI Street, north of Tehran. Another movie hall that I might choose is ESTEGHLAL, which is located in Vali-Asr Street. &amp; as I think about it more, ASR JADID in TALEGHANI Street is another movie hall I would recommend. Now, enough about movie halls remind me to write more on movies next time.

        In Farsi we don’t have vowels. We have some symbols to indicate the sound of them but it is not usually written in a text. & only first-graders use those symbols; so most of my students thought that using A, E or I is not necessary.... it took me some time to teach them to write the letters properly. Last time they had diction I reminded them to "use the vowels". The result was good except one of my students who wrote the Farsi symbols instead of the letters!

         I was teaching "can" & "can't" to my students the other day. &amp; there was a gorgeous 10-year old girl in the class; she looks like a model even now. Well, I asked her "can you walk?" & guess what she answered! "Yes, I cat walk." &amp; ever since then, every time I look at her I see her in a cat suit modeling!
