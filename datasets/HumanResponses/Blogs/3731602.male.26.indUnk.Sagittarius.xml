      So some things came up yesterday. Questionable things.  First, Lesbians. I had it described to me as well as witnessed it for myself, but lesbians are a lot different from bisexual chicks. A lot. But Im not really gonna get into that, I don't care to touch something that I can never be part of. Let me rephrase that, because I would love to touch what I can never be part of. I'm not going to try and explain what I think there differences are because I can never be either. But I do have one question: why can't they both decide to get along and get it on?   Anyway, is there a way to induce schizophrenia?    And now: House music.  Neat-o! Really, I have been getting pretty sick of it. But yesterday in Grant Park, with well over 100 people, I'm thinking around 300, house music took off. It was awesome to see that large of a crowd of diverse people dancing outside with the most beautiful skyline as a backdrop.  And none of that drug addled craziness you get at raves or the sweaty animalistic sex preying at clubs. Just sweet sweet grooves and a whole herd of people bouncing and throwing their hands up.  Beautiful!  Im not sure another form of music could produce such a vibe. Maybe Ska.

      As I step out in to the new frontier of this land so aptly named Blog, I wonder, what will I find? What is out here for me? And why the hell am I doing this? I really have nothing to say.  And yet, I feel it is for the same reason that some explorers (but not Vespucci, this fair land's namesake) set out on their quests. Merely for the sake of exploring new vistas and discovering new arenas.  Or, maybe I just need another way to waste time at work. Hopefully this can be my personal Chataqua, as whats-his-name mentioned in "Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," an unrestricted free-flowing of ideas, an uncharted mental journey. Maybe I'll go crazy at the end too.  Ok, this has all been a load of crap. But its fun, right?  I think I might just talk in the future about what I am doing and what I think about stuff. That's what these are for, right?  We shall see......

      What is it about Led Zeppelin that is so timeless, enjoyable, poignant, and dare-i-say, perfect? Honestly, the only band for which I will go out and search for a radio station that plays only the music of.  Which is a weird concept in itself. Searching for radio stations has taken over the thought process of deciding what CD to listen to.  Its different in some ways and the same in others.  For instance, I cant necessarily pick a specific band that i want to hear, but rather a genre or sometimes a mood. Very rarely can I request songs specifically either. This is also changing the way I listen to music.    In fact, constant access to the internet is changing my thought processes on many levels, and hence the very fabric of my self.  Constant imming has changed my communication patterns and speaking and conversation habits. I recognize myself now thinking in IM language and with IM timing sometimes in other forms of communication. I find myself needing to do something else while holding a conversation constantly. The internet is now my first and usually only destination when looking for information of any sort: addresses, directions, phone numbers, news, movie listings, concerts, DJs, what's going on this weekend. I have new forms of relationships as well: people i would never have kept in contact with i now have a completely internet related relationship with via email, blogs, IMs, messageboards, and friendster-like websites.    Its eery how one undefineable beast such as the internet can effect me on so many levels to the point of redefining ME.  But to resist this would be naive and archaic. Im constantly being changed by everything i allow my mind ot be absorbed by, and the internet is merely one of those forms. I think the most important thing is the awareness of this fact itself.   Regardless, I think I will stop now and listen to Stairway to Heaven.  Id hate to miss some of it due to the sound of me typing..........
