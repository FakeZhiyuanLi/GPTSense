       Saturdays ! Don’t you just love  Saturdays ? I love  Saturdays .  Saturdays  are fun. Today is no exception. Went out for a movie with my friends today even though I woke up this morning with an itchy throat and blocked nose. Went out to watch  SPIDERMAN ! Luckily Jeffri has a friend that’s working in the cinema or else we wouldn’t have gotten good seats. I mean…the highest row, and we got the tickets without queuing up like other people…mWAhAhahaAHa… Can’t help but laugh at those buggers queuing up. The best part is when they actually reached the counter and the tickets are all sold out! LoL…funny eh? I actually heard one woman saying, “Alamak, movie tu dah habis ticket lar”.  Anyway,  Spiderman  was sexay.  Dr. Octopus ? Even sexier! Spiderman was just waiting to have his groin crushed by him. Such sexy toy he has…4 metal indestructible tentacles waiting to smack the bejesus out of anyone that pisses him off. How sexy is that…those fuKking long tentacles can even stand a small supernova. If only I have that…then I’ll crush all my enemies with it… MwaHAhaha…I’ll even name myself…Dr. Chee Liang! Wait…that name is not cool enough. Think Chee Liang…think! Ah…I know, how about  Dr. Smasher ! Cool eh? No? Argh…nvm. Here’s how I’ll look.   urlLink    Dr. Smasher...  Oh…Jeffri was being such an asshole in the cinema. Lol…no offence Jeff, but you really were! He was like giving us lots of…erm, fugly “ thoughts ”. Dude…we’re in a cinema so behave man! Got to give him credit anyway cause he’s the one that got us the tickets!  THANKS  dude…you’re certified sexay! Well…gotta go eat dinner. Will blog again whenever I feel like it.

      I feel so tired…even coffee is not helping…might need another one later. I just finished fixing my templates. Took me quite awhile to figure out the links and stuffs. Anyway, the guys and I spent the whole afternoon watching people sing. Out of the 30-40 contestants there's only a few that can actually sing. I was trying so hard not to laugh…oh wait, not only me but others as well.   urlLink    Trying so hard not to laugh...  And did I mention how sucky the sound system was…? WTF…I mean even my headphone sounds better than that. It was pitiful watching the contestants singing the same tune all over again because of some fukKed up system.   urlLink    Even my headphone sound better...  My good friend, Roger was singing a  duet  with his  beloved Swee Ling  and boy was it fun. It was our plan in trying to get them closer together and as usual our plan failed. We were hoping that he will do something  special  like hold her hands and stuff but all he did was just stand there and sing monotonously. WTF man…where did all the courage go? Down the drain? You’ve just wasted a chance to “mengeratkan lagi your hubungan with her”. They were quite okay though…I mean their singing. However Roger needs more practicing cause he sounded more like talking instead of singing. Chong Wee and Elaine on the other hand was superb. They actually gave me goosebumps. Too bad they were joining this instead of Malaysian Idol… Anyway, time for some COFFEE!

      woHoo...! Oh..looky, I'm blogging! Everyone is blogging, I can't be left behind can I? I mean look at Roger…and Edwin…and of course Hyon-Xhi, they are all blogging. So FUK it…I'm gonna start blogging too. MwhaAhahaH…  There are a few things on my mind right now. One of them is how many more days it is before SPM arrives. I recently asked my friend from Kedah a few days ago and guess what, SPM is on the 6th of November…that is if she's giving me the right information. However, we can be sure that it'll either be end of October or early of November. FuK! That leaves us form 5s like…around 4 months to study…4 fukKing months to cover…hmm, lets see…say 10 subjects each with and average of at least 250 pages a subject…times that with 2 for form 4 and 5…that would be like 5000 pages… Now take 5000 pages and divide it by 120, it means that I would have to study at least 42 pages a day… You might be thinking hmm…42 pages a day is actually nothing much to brag about…it'll probably take like 2-3 hours to finish. It's so so not true…cause even if you do succeed in studying 42 pages a day…you might forget what you studied in like a week or so. Ain't life in Form 5 beautiful…? Damn, I'm beginning to regret spending too much time playing around. I should start studying now…but I can't seem to find the will to… I seriously need some biTch slapping to wake me up!!! Somebody…or just anybody…biTch slap me will you…bring back some sense into me… Oh wait, nvm…put that on hold, cause for now…caffeine will do! Caffeine…to me is actually one of the best things in life…! It actually helps me to study...for now. Screw you if you think otherwise…or better, BITE ME.

      It’s my favorite day of the week again… Woke up early today just to follow my dad out to eat bak-kut-the at Pandamaran. Went to school after that to watch the guys play some basketball. It was quite fun watching people getting kukufied… There was this team that that got kukufied so badly that they didn’t even managed to get a point in the first half. Shaun,  urlLink  Roger   and Wei Wei were like on fire! Especially Wei Wei…its like as though he bela the ball or something.  urlLink  Edwin Ng   on the other hand was not in his usual form.   He was so uptight during the game… Relax abit lar...why so nervous? Just play like normal lar. Where did your  “HIDDEN”  talent go? You flushed it down the toilet already isit? I came to watched you kukufy other people know! Not you being kukufied back!   urlLink    Spot the difference...  Did some  “Alam Sekitar work”  after that. Well, I didn’t really do anything…I was just following Soo Guan around. Followed  urlLink  Hyon-Xhi   back afterwards to see his “cute bitch”… DAMN, his puppy is fuKking cute. Argh…makes me feel like owning one already. So cute…that Soo Guan and I can’t stop playing with the puppy. She makes such cute expressions…  Soo Guan and me went shoe shopping after that at Jusco with  urlLink  Hyon-Xhi   and  urlLink  Xin Yi  . The first thing we did when we reached there was to take our lunch. Bought a Big Mac and we went to Starbucks to get some coffee and seats as there was no more seats at McD. Had my first taste of beef. I…Foo Chee Liang as of today, 10 July 2004, am no long a beef virgin. It kinda tasted like chicken…only that it’s sweeter. We did some stupid stuff at Starbucks… Taking pictures here and there.  urlLink  Xin Yi   even wrote a letter of erm…“appreciation”. We also had this idea of merging Starbucks and McD! Soo Guan suggested the name “Make”Bucks… Cool eh?   urlLink    10 years from now...  Had to go home early to follow my mom go do some grocery shopping at Carrefour. I feel so tired now…think I should go down and watch some tv.

      Party people…hey its Friday night!   Ah…Fridays! How time flies. Feels like Monday was just yesterday. It’s been awhile since I last blogged. 2 days already I think…since my last post…2 fuKking days. Do you have any idea how long is that? So…miss me? No? Hmm…nvm. Anyway, this week has been one of the busiest weeks I ever had. Been busy doing my bio and physic peka. FuK man…some of us have to redo our physic peka just because we miss out on our inference. What a waste of time…but for the sake of beautifying my SPM certificate…its worth it…I think!   I am beginning to brush my teeth 3 times a day now. The first one is in the morning before my breakfast; second one is after my dinner and the third one if before I go to bed. My teeth are getting fuglier day after day due to the amount of coffee I take. Must reduce coffee intake already…I don’t want my teeth to look brown and fugly!    urlLink    See the difference...?  I’ll need to go and scale my teeth soon. But I’m afraid of going to a dentist. Yea…you heard me, I’m afraid of going to a dentist! Is that such a big deal anyway? I mean…who isn’t afraid of going to a dentist. Just look at all those drills he has…now imagine if he/she is having PMS or something… Scary thoughts huh?   urlLink    Are you afraid now...?  Need to go finish off some stuff…so byE! If you're bored check  urlLink  this   out. Its super funny!

      I feel so sick right now. Woke up this morning with a blocked-nose. Oh wait...my nose is always blocked in the morning. Never mind that, anyway…after school, I went home took my lunch and fell asleep on the couch till 4.25. Woke up with a sore throat and rushed to Prasad after that. Prasad’s classes are so fuKking cold. I mean, imagine a classroom with 5 airconds and 3 fans all running at the same time. I was practically shivering during the last 30 minutes. Here’s how Prasad classes look like every time.    urlLink    Brr...shivers....  Oh...today my class had a “wonderful” English lesson with Puan Suraya today. She was asking Hyon-Xhi and me about erm…how should I put this… our “crush”! WTF man…I have no crushes and I don’t really believe in high school relationships anymore so ME having a crush is like saying sodium is more reactive than potassium. Whether or not if Hyon-Xhi has one…I don’t know. Lets just hope she doesn’t go around spreading gossips…loL or I’d be doomed!   I’m in a dilemma now. Should I go to the Nilai Campus thingy? If I go, I’ll miss Asiah… Ah…what the heck…I’ll just go along with them.

      Check, check, check, check…check, check, check it out…what, what, what, what, what…its all about… Sounds familiar? It’s from the BEASTIBOYS… Wicked song! Well from now on my site will no longer use  Hyon-Xhi’s copyrighted  stickmen anymore. From now on…my site will use…*drum rolls please… ORANG-ORANG!    urlLink    Evolution...  Stickmen will no longer populate my site… Now comes the day of ORANG-ORANG… May there be peace to all…    urlLink    What a joyous day for all...  Evolution usually takes millions of years to complete, however mine only takes an hour…so this means  I deserve a Nobel Prize Award  for my achievements in speeding up evolution. Screw you if you think otherwise. Anyway…today I shall bestow you people another picture. Accio picture…   urlLink    Mmm... Drools  Urm…that’s not me but my brother! LoL…just felt like sharing with you people this wonderful picture! He just shaved his head bald. I wonder how I’ll look if I do that. He looks  sexay  and  macho  right? So full of  manliness . Bet you people are drooling already… True or not? Haha…too bad he’s already taken. But fear not… for  I’m still available!  So leave me a message if you’re interested in me. loL...  P/s: My bro is gonna screw me up if he sees this…so do me a favor and keep this a secret. If you do, I’ll send you some sexy pictures of me… Do we have a deal?

      Hmm…it’s Friday…AGAIN. Time is moving so fast that yesterday seems like Monday to me. Started revising already… The thought of doing badly in  SPM  freaks me out.   Anyway,  BON ODORI  is here!!! Wee…it’s going to be FUN...FUN…FUN… The chics…food… aH…can’t wait for tomorrow. Heck, the place is so near to my place…I can just cycle there…unlike Soo Guan and the rest. Lol…I wonder if they know the way there. The roads in Shah Alam are pretty confusing. It’s all interconnected. They’ll fuKking get lost if they don’t know the way… There’s like 6-8 ways to go to Stadium Matsushita…maybe I should draw a map for them. Should I?   Yes? No?  We’ll decide about that later…  My day almost got ruined… Why? Because my cousin sis was screaming around when I was taking my evening nap. Annoying braT. She’s 12 years old and yet she’s still acting immaturely. Luckily it rained today. When out to play in the rain instead since I couldn’t get any sleep… Can’t really remember the last time since I last played in the rain. It’s been awhile…probably 3 years. Had so much fun walking under the rain. Everyone was looking at me as though like I’m some fuKtard… Stupid dicks with brain the size of a pea…wTF man…you people never walk under the rain before…?  My bro just broke up with his girlfriend. I wonder how is he? Hope he’s okay… Relationships…they don’t fuKking last in High school or in University do they? So what’s the point then in having them…? For the heck of it? ArgH…I don’t know…and I don’t wanna know either.  I’m quite free now…so I might as well draw a map for them… I’m such a  good friend .  FuK you  if you don’t think so.

      These past few days have been cruel to me. Been having headaches and stomachaches since Sunday. Argh…why? Why? I’m beginning to think that its probably bad karma. Maybe I’ve been annoying  urlLink  Edna   too much. She probably got fed up and secretly put a curse on me…  urlLink  Edna  …you  evil HOE . LoL…just kidding there…  I was watching this drama yesterday…and guess what…it fuKking enlightened me. There was this guy who was advising his daughter about not seeing things from only one point of view. Their words actually smack some sense into me. I’ve always been prejudice. Their words made me feel like some pathetic lowlife whose only existence is to fukKing judge people by just looking at them. I feel so low… All right then…from now on…I shall not judge people until I get to know them. I bet  urlLink  Hyon-Xhi   and  urlLink  Edna   is probably laughing their ass out while they are reading this. Never mind…for I shall prove it to them that I’m gonna stop being prejudice…    urlLink    Me...from today onwards...  Anyway…today’s Kimia lesson was seriously fun. I learned something new… I learned how to tie a girl’s hair. Guess who the guinea pig was…its non other than… urlLink  EDNA  !!! Thanks  urlLink  EDNA  …you really made my day! To repay your kindness…I shall annoy you again with the Queen’s song tomorrow… Cheers to that...yAY!!!  Have to sign off now… Need to revise…SPM is just months away!

      I got a fuKking migraine right now. Argh…and just 20 minutes ago I had a combo of both migraine and stomach ache. Did someone voodoo-ed me or something… I think I need to practice some Taichi.   urlLink    Me...practising Taichi...  Went over to my family’s  “Rumah Pusaka”  today for my 4th uncle’s retirement party. Lots of food was served and we had a great time mainly because…we hadn’t had any reunion since Cheng Ming. Ever since our grandmother pass away, we’ve had very little reunions. Damn…I miss my childhood days. Our family is now getting filled with the Xiang generation already. I’m the last of my generation incase you don’t know. I’m the last person in the Chee’s generation. In about 10 years time the first sons of the Xiang's generation is gonna be as old as me. I’ll probably be married by then… Nevertheless, it’s still a long way to go…

      School was fun today. Spend most of my time in the school dewan and computer lab rehearsing for the play. Damn…it was seriously fun. Wei Wei as usual was playing a fool making us laugh non-stop. Don’t really know how to describe Wei Wei’s acting to you people…all I can say is he can really make you laugh your asses out. Kean Leong…the tall guy was acting as the coconut tree…you should’ve seen him dance…fuKking hilarious.   Skip Prasad today. Why…? I was too lazy. Fell asleep till 5.30. Hmm…just a few weeks ago I was telling myself to stop playing a fool. Fuk…fUk…fuK…percubaan is just 2 weeks away. Must…study and stop…playing!!!   I just noticed that I get aggravated easily. Stuffs like not waking up early when I should be…not getting my coffee or tea in time and late for school seriously ticks me off. Why am I even telling you people this? Its not like you people care or anything…  True or not?

      Haven’t been blogging for a few days now…been busy. I have yet to complete my PJK and Moral folio. Argh…and to add to my frustration, my comp has been crashing at least 3 times a day. FukKing hell…just wait till I get the Win 98 cd from Ronnie…then I’ll fukKing format my comp.   Neway… I’m acting in a school play! Yay! Soo Guan…Roger…Wei Wei…Terry and Shaun are in it too! Mwahahaha… As usual…Roger spoilt the whole play! HAHAHAHAHA…loL…he keeps laughing on the stage. Stupid fella…Soo Guan also can tahan you cannot tahan isit… Better not laugh during the real play…or we’ll screw you up man!   Wanna know what I’m acting as…? I’m gonna act as  “THE”  TONGKAT ALI! MwahahahA…x100 (*the famous Austin Power laugh)  And guess what… ROGER’s gonna be the  “impotent”  guy that needs me. Weee……… I’m his saviour! I’ll make him go from 0.001 to……100000 *ehem* inches *ehem*   urlLink    Heh...heH...heh  P/s: I'm so so dead if Roger sees this...

      Feeling tired as usual. Went to school early in the morning to do lil’ bit of banner painting and watch people getting kukufied in basketball… Banner painting was quite “fun”…cause I got coaxed into spending Chia Yean McD. Basketball was even better…cause Roger’s team got fuKked in the finals by Bobby’s team! Yay…!   Went Shaun’s house after that. Had 2 “kuay peng” for lunch cause we figure out that the food at  Bon Odori  is gonna be fuKking expensive…and guess what…it really is. I mean, 4 bucks for just a bowl of ice with nothing but lemon syrup and condensed milk… FukKing rip offs…I can get 2 bowl of ice kacang for the same price! Nevertheless…we still had fun there. Dancing around shouting  “OI” …maN… Wouldn’t it be fun if our everyday life were like that?   There were lots of chicks there…which means… Chicks = Eyesore =  urlLink  Hyon-Xhi’s TERROR-MYCIN    Don’t know what to write anymore… I’m too tired to think. Think I’ll sign off now. Anyway before I sign off...   HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY  urlLink ROGER!   Hope you had a nice day...

      Haven’t been blogging much lately… Was busy finishing my moral folio. Finally finished it last Thursday. Didn’t really bother decorating the cover. And I have a feeling the teacher’s gonna cut my mark for “creativity”. FuK it…who the hell cares anyway. The only reason I finished it was because I didn’t wanna kukufy my own SPM certificate.  I’m officially sick again. Damn those fuKking viruses. This is the second time in this month I got flu. My nose is blocked…I can’t breathe properly…and the worse thing is, mucus keeps flowing out. Argh…I hate getting sick. Went to school yesterday with a depresso face and Edna thought I got dumped or something… loL.   Woke up today feeling  abit  better. Had a cup of tea…since tea is healthier than coffee. In case you don’t know…1 cup of green tea contains the same amount of caffeine as 1 cup of coffee. The only difference is that coffee contains substance that irritates your stomach. Speaking about coffee, I haven’t had one since Bon Odori.   Just spend 3 hours playing FreeCell. Think I’ll go play something else…maybe minesweeper…

      Ways to ANNOY people… ·	When someone is asking you a question…answer with the phrase… “Why must I tell you” ·	When people call you…tell them to SHUT UP ·	When people say Hi to you…return the Hi plus the word BITCH or GITCH behind…(*gitch=ghey-bitch) ·	When people are looking at you…show them your middle finger. ·	When your friends are talking about their crushes…degrade their crushes in front of them… ·	Sit at places with lots of passerby…then speak out loud the phrase… “Ei, lengjai/lenglui…” If they look at you…look back at them and say… “I calling you ar? Perasan…”  And there you have it…simple ways to annoy the hell out of people… Till then…

      Just cut my hair today. It looks pretty short now… Should I spike it up tomorrow…? If I do…I’m gonna get fuKked by the discipline teacher for sure cause we students are not allowed to use jell. WtF man… They practically tried to make us look like some fukTards! First they make sure our shirt doesn’t cover our belts…now they fuKking impose a ban on jell usage… So what are we supposed to use…? Cum? Like the movie “There’s Something About Mary”? Shsss…idiots…real idiots... I fukKing doubt their brain would be any bigger than a carbon-12 molecule.   I’m on the verge of finishing my PJK folio…! MwahHAHha… Now all that is left is my moral folio…! If all goes well…then my Moral folio should be done by Wednesday or Thursday. MwahahahHAa…I’m so hardworking…TEEHEE! Signing off now…need to practice my umbrella swinging techniques for the play tomorrow… Till then…go dig your nose…if you have nothing to do…

      Yay! I finally had my first coffee after 2 weeks. And guess what…I actually forgot how good it taste. Brings back fond old memories…oh wait…was there even any memories to begin with…? Hm…never mind. MmmMm…I can still remember how good the smell was…the aroma of coffee with caramel…aHh…god,  I JUST LOVE COFFEE.    I'm almost cured of my flu already…thanks to the godly wonders of a bowl of chicken porridge, which I ate yesterday.   Thank you chicken porridge…for curing me. I will never forget you…  I actually felt better after eating it. You might think that I'm bullshiting…but believe it or not…I did feel better…so PISS off! Wait…the word piss is just too polite…I need something more impolite…hmm…how bout, go  HISAP TELUR …? Better…? Yeah??? Okay…let's start back from the beginning…  *ehem* I did feel better…so go  HISAP TELUR!    Anyway…just finish watching some  "corny" serial dramas back to back. That's 10 episodes…in 7 hours! MuAhahhahwaahhaha…I'm so good at being a couch potato! Hmm…maybe I can rewatch them again later…  Signing off now…wanna go play some Minesweeper…   *HISAP TELUR  = suck egg or suck ball; the word HISAP TELUR is taken from the website  suckball.com . All credits goes to  THEM  for creating that word… NOT ME .
