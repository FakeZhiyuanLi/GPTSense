         William introduced me to the wonderful world of blogs, but first I have to say that I hate the word blog. Almost as much as I hate it when people pronunciate the words milk and pillow as melk and pellow. Or the words veggie and platter. Will and I got together for breakfast today at Country Boy on Manitou, and when we came back to my apartment here, he promptly locked his keys in his car. I've never seen anyone cry as much.  Then he proceeded to try to gain access from the back of the car, the trunk (I'll refrain from the obvious joke), which he was unsuccessful at. It was very tempting to lock Will in the trunk, but I thought I'd be nice. That's all for now.

       All For the Love We Want  It's shortly after 2 in the morning and I'm drinking a Diet Coke and listening to Beth Nielsen Chapman, an underappreciated songwriter from the States. The Christmas lights in my bedroom window are on as usual (don't worry, they're not the green and red ones, they're white lights). Pretty soon I'll go to bed, right after writing this most likely. I walked home from work tonight, around 11:30pm, and it was drizzling slightly. The sidewalks were quite slippery, and I'm surprised that I didn't fall down. I'm ready for spring. I like the snow, but we've had quite a bit this year and I'm just ready for it all to go away. I'm ready for warm sunny days. One of my best memories, actually more than one of my best memories, comes from the time I spent at Esgenoopititj First Nation, a Miqmaq native reserve in Burnt Church, New Brunswick. I traveled there along with around 12 others for a week and a half during 4 summers, the last being about 5 years ago I guess. I remember one night a few of us stayed up all night and then went outside to catch the sunrise along the bay. We sang and made shadows against the cliff. Ranking higher than that though are the memories of carrying little children on my back while walking around the reserve. One girl in particular, Shahila, stole my heart. I remember carrying her on my back and her giggling in my ear. She was probably 4 or 5 I guess.  Anyways, I don't know exactly what I want to write today, so bear with me. Stream of consciousness, isn't that what they call it?  Love. How much of it is about giving love to someone and being what they need, and how much is about needing to receive it from others. Of course I think it's both. People talk about how real love is selfless and is all about giving to someone else. And that's all well and good in theory and on paper, but I'll be the first to admit that when I love I need love in return. I think we have to be careful not to swing too far one way or the other. I think we need to learn to accept love without feeling strange or embarrassed or not worthy of it. Also, I think we need to strive to give love for the sole purpose of wanting to give a gift to another person/people. I think the real task is in learning to live in acceptance of yourself. So many people dislike, or hate themselves for one reason or another. And they have an awful time accepting love because of that. I certainly wouldn't say that I love myself, but I also don't think that it's prideful to strive for that very thing. I've known people who are very loving and giving to those around them, but you can tell that they have a very low opinion and acceptance level of themselves. I think that its when we're grounded in love and acceptance that we can be free to both give and receive love unabashedly. I pray I learn to do this. An author I've enjoyed reading in the past that talks about such things is the late Henri Nouwen. While he talks about learning to live grounded in God the Person, I think we're talking about virtually the same thing. Some of his writings are so personal and truthful that sometimes I'm quite uncomfortable reading them. But they are wonderful and I highly recommend him. Actually, a daily meditation from his writings can be found at  urlLink nouwen.net . I guess that's all for now. My Diet Coke is almost gone.

       Jesus and J-Lo   I think I'm going to hibernate until February 25th, which is next Wednesday I believe. Short hibernation, I know, but then at least I'll be spared all the endless talk of The Passion of the Christ. My goodness, every blog I stumble on has a big posting about it, and of course, now here I am writing about it. But I'm not going to start a discussion on whether it's anti-Semitic, or whether its right that churches are going to use it to recruit people, or whether Jim Caviezal looks like Steve Buschemi (okay, i don't know where that came from). All I'm going to do is go WATCH THE DARN THING! I don't think I've been sick of so much chatter and debate since JLo and Ben. Enough already! Calm down folks! Its The Last Temptation of Christ all over again, but reverse! Nothing like a movie to stir up the masses.

       Growing Older  The bed is turned up, I'm comfortable in my pajamas, and it's after 1 in the morning. Three good reasons to suggest that I'm ready to call it a night. And I am. In a couple minutes. I just came into my room from watching some documentary on TVO about a cancer ward at a hospital in Toronto. It was quite moving because of the reality of it all and the lack of being "jazzed up" in any way. No narration, just following patients around during their daily routine, listening in on their conversations and those of the nurses and doctors around them. The one patient was a woman who must have been late 80's at least. It was difficult to watch as she struggled to breathe and was so very very thin and frail. Even more difficult when they showed her dead a bit later on. I hate sickness. I've hated seeing family ill, even if it isn't as serious as cancer. I remember my dear grandmother Dorothy Elizabeth Alward, who has been gone from here over 10 years now. She had a wonderful heart, and was simple and humble, and we loved her for it. It wasn't anything fancy, but Grandma made the best roast beef and potatoes I've ever had. Grandma Alward became quite frail in her later life and she would fall and hurt herself. It was hard to take, especially since I was pretty young. It's still hard to think about. I wish we didn't have to go out like that. Due to sickness or being very old and not being able to take care of yourself. Of course not everyone goes out like that, some are very healthy until a "ripe old age" and just die. I hope that's the way with me, but moreso for those that are most precious to me, namely my parents. Watching that old, so very frail woman on TV tonight, I wondered, "What did she look like as a young lady? What made her laugh? And what is going through her mind as her body slowly gives up?" And as the picture turned to her dead body lying there in the hospital, I wondered "What is life all about?" Is that all there is? Of course there's much more to her life, and to everyone's life than what can be seen in a half hour on a television program, but the question still stays with me. One question. And a mind full of hopes that I'll accomplish something and wishes will come true.

       To Buy or to Rent  I've been in the habit of buying CD's quite regularly since I was 15 or so. That was when CD's were all around 24 or 25 dollars. Now that they're cheaper, sometimes I buy 2 at a time. I don't like how many CD's I buy sometimes. Same with DVD's. They're not exactly cheap, and what really is the point of buying them when you're only going to watch them once every half year if that. I could just as easily rent them when I want to see them and I'd save a lot of money.   And, cue the bell that says "It's Mark gets reflective time."   Why do we buy so much, why are malls so popular and busy? I think its because we have a thing with ownership. We think the more we own the more happy we'll be. There's something about a product being "mine" that makes me feel good. Of course, often there comes a time after buying a few CD's or whatever it may be, that in a moment of weakness we feel that none of the crap is fulfilling us or making us content with our life. But, we quickly fight that feeling off and go out and buy something else. I don't like that. I have quite a lot of respect for people who live fairly meagerly, or frugally. Frugally, I like that word. It brings memories of Fraggle Rock. Anyways, where was I. Ah yes, frugal people. It's not because they're cheap (well, it could be), but a lot of people abandon rampant commercialism and find peace in something much more worthwhile, such as volunteerism, or spirituality, or terrorism. Kidding, strike that one from the record.  Rich Mullins was one of those people I looked up to. A singer who died in a car wreck in 97, although he had quite a bit of money, he donated a lot of it and lived in people's attics or basements. He insisted that he only keep what the average working American made in a year and the rest he donated. There's a man who wasn't so very tied up in buying and buying and buying.   Moving on...I'm drinking milk. 1%. I made the dramatic switch from 2% a few months ago and now 2% just tastes gross to me. Speaking of gross, I fondly remember when I was in the banqueting department at the hotel and after a dinner one night I grabbed a small pitcher of coffee creamer that had been sitting on a table for probably 4 hours and chugged it, much to the disgust of a co-worker. Good stuff. Anyways, I suppose that's all for now.

       Inward, Outward  It's around 10 in the morning, listening to Lyle Lovett. If someone would have told me even 3 years ago that i'd be listening to Lyle Lovett quite regularly I would have laughed and grimaced. I've really got into the folk/country stuff in the last year and a half or so though. Just seems to have a real-life feel to it; some of it is just plain earthy, especially Lucinda Williams. I highly recommend her latest album World Without Tears; some excellent songwriting. Her voice takes some getting used to, but she makes some excellent music. Anyways, the reason for the title. I'm a person of extremes quite often. Sometimes I am very private and inward. For about 2 years prior to this past year I didn't really go out with people, or talk about much of importance. I do feel badly if I neglected certain friends and I don't attempt to make excuses for it. But I'm also learning to have grace towards myself, and I think there are times in life, even extended times like years, where you need to step back and deal with things or sort through things yourself. And to be around people, even those you are closest to, sometimes drives you crazy. I am however glad that that period of my life is over. Though I haven't bounced back the other way, that is to say I am not a social buttterfly and still don't go out all the time. I am still quite a private person, and you really have to pry to get things out of me. I like that about me. But I think everyone has to be careful not to live completely inward and not open up to some people around you. I don't want to be an open book to people. I'd rather have a couple close friends than 20 acquaintances. Perhaps all this is quite vague, but its just what i felt like writing.

       Grammy Awards, etc.  What a terrible awards show! I hadn't watched the Grammy's for 2 or 3 years, and if they were anything like last nights show, I didn't miss a whole lot. Terrible. First question is: What was with the 20 minutes tribute to funk? Much of the fashion prior to the tribute was terrible, but the funkmasters topped the cake. As far as performances go, Sarah McLachlan was perhaps the only classy performance. Her and Celine Dion actually. And how about all the to-do for the late Warren Zevon, and hardly a thing for the Man in Black? Though it was good to see both Johnny and June win awards.  As far as the upcoming Oscars are concerned, I think Charlize Theron has it in the bag for best actress, and perhaps Sean Penn for best actor. I'd be kind of surprised if Peter Jackson doesn't win best director, and if LOTR doesn't finally win best picture. Last Samurai should have been nominated though.

       Wretched world  It's not always a nice thing to wake up in the morning, turn on the computer and read the news. Particularly when the news is so terrible as it is this morning. They found that missing 11-yr old girl in Florida, dead. I guess after Elizabeth Smart was found alive I have higher hopes. But there was no happy ending this time. Makes me sick that people can do that to other human beings. Top that with the suicide bombing in Moscow today killing around 40 people. We hear stuff like this all the time. Israel, Afghanistan, Iraq. Can't believe how good we have it here in Canada.

       Live Like You'll Die Tomorrow  This was a lyric in one of Rich Mullins' songs. Rich was a Christian musician and exemplary human being who died in a car wreck in 97. He seemed to live by this saying. I've been thinking about this since watching The Blackwater Lightship, a new TV movie that premiered on CBS last night. Starring Angela Lansbury and others, it was about 3 generations of women in this family that were estranged and brought back together by their grandson/son/brother's illness. He was dying of AIDS. Movies like this make me think: "What would I want people to know and what would I want to say to certain people before I died?" An even bigger thought that comes to mind is "Why don't we live like we'll die tomorrow, everyday?" It seems to me that there would be a lot more vitality to life, and a lot more urgency if I lived this way. Tell the people I love that I love them. Don't put off my future dreams. Encourage people and tell them the things I really want to tell them. Life seems quite long when you're still in your 20's, but it won't always be that way. I can't always coast. One day I'll be 80, provided I live that long, and I don't want a tonne of regrets. Certainly there'll be some because none of us are perfect, far from it. But we can prevent many of them. It pisses me off how we go through life never, or seldomly (is that a word?) telling those around us, and often those who are closest to us, how we really feel about them. Instead we watch hockey games, make sarcastic remarks, and discuss what was on Letterman the night before. While I'm not suggesting everyone goes around spreading tidbits of truth to everyone they lay eyes one, I think there's more to life than this.

       Foolproof   Foolproof is a song written and performed by Ron Sexsmith, a highly talented and highly unappreciated Canadian artist. Most of his music is folkish, however this song is more of a jazz selection. He initially wrote it for Canadian jazz artist Diana Krall, but she hasn't recorded it. The lyrics are as follows:  Foolproof That’s what my heart’s become And I challenge anyone to break in I challenge anyone to make me open up the door Cos I’ve been fooled before And now I’m...  Foolproof Older and wiser now And I’m never gonna fall for that old, Never gonna fall for that old Fairy tale anymore Cos I’ve been schooled before  And cos I’m foolproof  And I dare  Anyone to try Not a care In the world have I  As long as I am foolproof  Oh no, they can’t fool me  Cos I’ve been around the block a few times Been around enough to know I’m Coming back for more Cos I believe that your heart is pure And cos I’m...  Foolproof That’s what my heart’s become  -------------  My friend Chris included a quote by Auerbach (who I admittedly don't know much about) in an e-mail the other day: "Music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life." I certainly agree. And there is a lot of dust in many of our lives. Disappointments, personal failures, sickness, etc. And it's awfully tempting to shut ourselves off to love and to our dreams. Perhaps I'm coming close to sounding "hokey" here, but oh well. Somehow we have to hold onto hope, not close ourselves off from others. I've written in a friend's blog that for me there is one big choice in life: to open ourselves to love and growth, or to close ourselves off from them. I hope I never do the latter. It's awfully tempting, and probably more so as you get older, but hopefully it never happens. You have to work at it too. Choosing to open up, choosing to chase your dreams, etc. Anyways, just a couple thoughts there.

      Last night I was tending bar as usual at the Holiday Inn, and in our ballroom we had a Muslim Youth of Kitchener Waterloo function going on. There were about 190 people attending. Myself and other staff members were making quite a few jokes about checking shoes, watching for padding, etc. It comes to mind that however humourous we intended our comments to be, they were still wrong. Humourous prejudice is still prejudice sometimes. Especially when it's a bunch of white people talking.  Now that I'm online I've taken the opportunity to do something that I at times find cool and other times stupid: ordering pizza online. It's a novelty, but it takes longer to order pizza online than it does to pick up the phone and do it. But the big pay off is that you get free garlic bread by ordering online.

       urlLink    Perhaps you've heard some of Ron Sexsmith's music. If you haven't I highly recommend you to check some of it out. This is his latest album, came out about a month ago. And I got it for $11.99 @ Best Buy, nice. Anyways, Ron Sexsmith is a Canadian artist who gets a lot of critical praise but not much airplay at all. Its unfortunate, because both his songwriting and musical style are excellent. He's sort of folk with a little bit of pop and rock sometimes. You can check out his latest video "Whatever It Takes" on his website, ronsexsmith.com. &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    I just got home from work at the hotel about half an hour ago, and now I'm here listening to Big River by Johnny Cash. I'm a huge Johnny Cash fan. My dad used to have a few of his records, and I liked him back then when I was a kid. Then I didn't really listen to him for years. About a year before he died I started listening to Cash a whole lot again. He really took a chance doing the material he did in his later life, such as covers of Soundgarden's "Rusty Cage", and Nine Inch Nails' "Hurt." I go in phases; for the last few months I've really been into his stuff from the late 50's/60's. Songs like "Hey Porter," "One Piece at a Time," "Ring of Fire," "Oh What a Dream." So why Peter Rabbit? Firstly, it's continuing on the old kids TV show kick that I'm on. This particular image of Peter was from "Fables of the Green Forest" that used to air on TVOntario. It was probably my favourite kids show, with Hammy Hamster following close by. Speaking of rabbits, tonight when I was walking home from work, listening to Alanis Morissette's latest album, I saw at least 3 rabbits, perhaps 4, jumping around the park down the street from my apartment building. It was cool. Sometimes I see one, but never 3 or 4. &nbsp; urlLink

      Well, it's almost a quarter to 3 in the morning on Saturday now, and I just got in about half an hour ago. I tended bar from 3 till 11:00 as usual on a Friday night, and then headed over to the establishment next to the hotel that I work at. A co-worker of mine, Amanda, worked her last shift yesterday and a few of us went over for a beverage or two, or two-and-a-half, as it was in my case. She wrote her e-mail address on a piece of the cigarette pack she was carrying, and it was DuMaurier something or other. This gets me thinking a little bit. Not only does smoking take years off a persons life, but they are also wasting valuable seconds of that life by having to say "DuMaurier Extra Light King Size" whenever they ask for smokes at the local convenience store. And it gets worse if they want a small pack. Anyways, enough about smoking. More about Hammy Hamster. I posted a pic of Hammy in my last entry, and since then was reassured at the hotel that other people indeed watched Hammy. And then we got talking about other classic shows that we used to watch such as Today's Special, The Friendly Giant, The Little Prince, and Polka Dot Door, back when the stuffed animals nor Polkaroo could talk. That's just wrong what they've done with that show. Anyways, fond memories all around.   Alcohol does strange things to people. Makes us say things we would like to say but don't have the guts to say otherwise. Makes us say things that we don't really like to say but we spill out anyways since we're so relaxed. Another thing that crossed my mind tonight, though, is the "cool" factor. For some dumb reason people think that it makes them cooler if they can unwind and drink. And wanting to be cool is a less vulnerable way of saying that you want to be loved and accepted. So that's what it all comes down to for me. We all want to be loved and accepted, and we want those things without having to put up some sort of false front or fake personality. We all need to hear that its okay to be ourselves. Not ourselves + the $100 pair of jeans. Not ourselves + the $50 haircut. Not ourselves + the witty jokes and the forced laughter. Just ourselves. To know we are loved and accepted, just as we are. I think that's what we need to know. I don't fully know it yet, do any of us...really?

       Thursday, May 27, 2004   Matilda  It's around quarter after 10pm now, and Lyle Lovett is playing through my speakers. John Sleeman's Honey Brown Lager is in my glass.   I volunteer at St. Mary's General Hospital on Thursdays, for a couple of hours in the afternoon. My job is, to put it simply, visit people. So I get a patient list and I go to rooms and chat it up with people. Most of these people are over 70, quite a few of them over 80 years old. I get to look all official, wearing a light blue jacket and a photo badge. A little girl once yelled "Hi, Doctor!" on the street when she saw me. I smiled. Anyways, I like visiting old people. I don't think there's anything worse than being in the hospital than being old and in the hospital. I mean, it's bearable I suppose if they have children or spouses that come in regularly to visit, but some of them don't have anyone, and if they do have someone they might not be able to come in often. Several weeks ago I was walking down the wing on the 5th or 6th floor of the hospital and I saw this old lady sitting in a wheelchair in the hallway. When she saw me she looked up with wide eyes, smiled, and reached out her hand. So I knelt beside her and held her hand (she had a good grip for a 70-80 year old woman). I don't think she ever said a word to me during the 20 minutes or so I spent with her. Now, this could be due to several reasons. Perhaps she didn't speak English (she had a foreign last name I think), or more likely she wasn't mentally what she used to be. But that's besides the point. I was so taken with this lady, named Matilda, as she just latched onto me and held my hand and wouldn't let go. I talked with her for awhile, about family, weather, you know, the usual. At one point as I was on one knee in front of her holding her hand I remarked "you know what this looks like, it looks like I'm proposing to you!" I think this lady wanted what just about all of us want. Some sort of companionship. It's just that she was at a place in her life where she didn't have the walls that most of us do, and instinctively, without delay, reached out her hand to someone. Although she didn't/couldn't talk, we had a wonderful time. Her eyes lit up as soon as she grabbed onto my hand. I was captivated by her. Do you know what I'm getting at here? Do I know what I'm getting at here? I hope so.   Have you ever seen A Beautiful Mind? I think that was the last time I cried, seeing that movie. I remember seeing it at Cineplex Odeon on Fairway, and going out behind the theatre after the show and bawling my eyes out. It felt good. I saw it three times in theatres, but have avoided it every since. It just affects me a lot, and sometimes I'm scared of that.   Anyways, I guess that's it for today. Except that I like running into people. I was chatting with a fellow volunteer in the hospital lobby today, and my old pastor Mike, who just moved into the city, came in and it was nice to see him. Then I went to Subway after my guitar lesson later on, and the woman next to me saw my Johnny Cash sticker on my guitar case and we had a good chat about Cash.

       Thursday, May 27, 2004   A Whole Lotto Shakin' Goin' On  I just won 10 bucks on Lotto 649, nice. Not a bad return on my 2 dollars. Now I can send the kids to college. Either that or pay off my own time in college.   It's around midnight, very early on Thursday morning technically. I just went out for a jog/walk. It's a very nice night out. About 10 degrees, clear skies, no muggers. Actually I feel quite safe in this neighbourhood of Kitchener. I'm just trying to get back what it feels like to jog regularly. Actually, that's a lie. I've never jogged regularly, though I have quite a few times. Now I have a jog-proof discman, so I have company. Anyways, enough about my Olympic training. My comment option doesn't seem to be working right now, so if anyone has any burning thoughts, feel free to e-mail me: markalward78@yahoo.ca  On to other matters...  I haven't seen any election signs yet, besides the ones at the NDP campaign office here in Kitchener. For any of you that are reading this outside of Canada, our prime minister called an election for June 28th. I love elections. I've always followed politics, got it from my Dad, who got it from his Dad. My party affiliation hasn't exactly been stable up to this point, as a few of my friends (yes, especially you Will) would attest to. I used to gravitate toward the old Progressive Conservative party, then I liked the Liberal party, and now I'm seriously considering voting NDP (New Democratic Party); they're the leftist party in Canadian politics. The odds of Jack Layton becoming Prime Minister this year are even less than the odds of there being NHL hockey next season, but I think they'll improve considerably on the last elections results.  Lyle Lovett has this album called I Love Everybody. It's quite good, but that's besides the point. I like the title, 'cause I can relate to it. Throughout the day I find myself falling for almost every pretty girl I see; at the coffeeshop, at the library, at the mall. And not the girls that have to wear tonnes and tonnes of makeup or wear very questionable clothing. You know, the pretty ones. I even contemplate striking up a conversation with them sometimes, though perhaps I would get hit in the head with a purse (that's more of an old woman thing though isn't it?) It's just that I've been single for over 3 years now, and I think, or at least like to think, that it's high time I fall in love with someone. This isn't a boo-hooing here, just what I'm thinking. I think I'm a nice guy, I think I have a lot to offer. I'm quite quiet and private sometimes, but I'm more of a one-on-one person who seems to only click with relatively few people, when it comes to personal matters that is. It would just be nice to be able to share things with someone. Anyways, enough about that.   Did I mention I won 10 bucks in the lottery tonight?

      Yes, I went to see Michael Moore's film today. This morning I wasn't sure if I should go see it or not, but after weighing the pros and Cannes, I decided to go to Silvercity and see it. It was a 4:20 show, and there was quite a good crowd on hand. It was pretty much what I expected. 2 hours of making fun of Bush and assailing his war on Iraq. And that's fine with me. I've never really liked Bush, and the facts presented in Fahrenheit about the Bush/Saudi relationship are quite startling. The grainy quality to the newsclips was fairly annoying, but I got used to it after the first 15 minutes or so. The girl beside me cried, and understandably so - there are a few quite disturbing moments in the documentary. And a few people applauded at the end. All in all, I'm glad I went to see it.

      I took the bus to Silvercity this evening to see Fahrenheit 9/11, and I thought I would be safe and get a ticket over an hour before it started, but alas it was sold out. I decided to go see The Terminal instead. I like Tom Hanks a lot, but had heard mixed reviews of this movie. I was skeptical going into it, but it was a very good movie. Keep in mind that I also liked Lost In Translation in retrospect. The Terminal is pretty drawn out at times, like Translation, but because I like Tom Hanks I didn't mind. Catherine Zeta-Jones-Douglas is also in this, and she's fine. Although there is a romantic element to the movie, its not the main theme, and that was a nice surprise. This is one I could see myself buying on DVD.

      I am quite pleased by the outcome of yesterday's election. I wasn't shocked that the Liberals won a minority, but I was surprised that it wasn't closer between them and the Conservatives. I didn't get too optimistic as the numbers from Atlantic Canada came in and the Liberals were doing quite well. A lot depended on Ontario here, and that's where the surprise came. While the Conservatives have picked up more seats, there was no major breakthrough. I am pleased that the NDP gained 6 seats over the last election in 2000, although I was hoping for at least 30 seats instead of the 19 they now hold. It was looking for quite awhile that they would hold the balance of power in parliament, but it didn't quite turn out that way. I am pleased that they will have a larger role in governing though. And having Ed Broadbent, their former leader, back as an MP will be great.   The end result is:  Liberal - 135    Conservative - 99    Bloc Quebecois - 54    NDP - 19 Independent (will probably rejoin the Conservative caucus) - 1   The disturbing trend of low voter turnouts continued last night. I was shocked late last night to hear that turnout was around 60.4%, the lowest since 1898 in Canada. WAKE UP PEOPLE!  In a lot of places I don't think that Canadians were voting for the Liberals, but they were voting against the Conservatives. I think Paul Martin's "don't trust Harper" messages in the last few days had an impact. But it wasn't all smoke and mirrors. I think people were rejecting Conservative hints of two-tier health care, and working closer with George Bush militarily, among other things. Also, undisciplined comments by Conservative candidates and MP's during the campaign had a large effect on the outcome. For example, the Conservative candidate in my riding, Frank Luellau, was quoted as saying that homosexuality is a disorder and people should receive counselling for it. Thomas Ichim, another local Conservative candidate, joked at an all-candidates meeting that the reason the NDP fielded more women candidates was because they had prettier women. Many Canadians are not comfortable at all with attitudes like that. I like to think Canada is more progressive than that.   So, all in all I am pleased. I wish the NDP held the balance of power, but at least they picked up a few seats.

       urlLink    It's here, election day in Canada. For those of you unfamiliar with Canadian politics, these are the party leaders (L-R): Prime Minister Paul Martin (Liberal Party), Stephen Harper (Conservative Party), Jack Layton (New Democratic Party), Gilles Duceppe (Bloc Quebecois), and Jim Harris (Green Party - the Greens have never held a seat in parliament, but I felt sorry for Jimbo so I included him here!) There are 308 seats up for grabs for the upcoming parliament. The Liberals have been in power for a decade now, without much competition due to a split right-wing vote. But due to the fact that the conservative vote is united - among other things such as the Liberal sponsorship program scandal - it will be much closer, the closest election in decades. My predictions are as follows: Liberals - 118, Conservatives - 109, NDP - 28, and Bloc - 53. Make sure to get out and have your say!

       urlLink    (L-R Me, Will Loewen of Menno Melange fame, and Ken Peters)  This is a classic picture I just found tonight in time to post for election day. This was taken at a Progressive Conservative Party rally in London, Ontario in 1997. I had to think hard if it was 93 or 97, because I have the memory of a junebug, but I'm almost definite it's from 97. Ken and I supported the PC party, while Will was a staunch Reform Party (another conservative party at the time) supporter. I love how Will covered up the PC logo on the jacket. We had went to see Jean Charest, then leader of the PC party, and ended up wearing these jackets and standing up on stage with him as he gave his speech. These were the good old days, lots of fun. However, Will got the last laugh as Reform won 60 seats, and the PC's 20.

       urlLink    Thought you might enjoy an old picture of Jack Layton today. It looks like he's starring in a 70's TV crime drama. Anyways...2 days until the election. More and more people I've been talking to lately are voting NDP, it's quite interesting. I don't have any illusions that they'll win, but I think they could have a very important role in the next parliament. Time will tell. Conservative MP's continue to run their mouths off; really guys, it's only 2 more days. KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Stephen Harper must be pretty pissed off with Luellau, Ichim, and now White. .... Moving on, thanks for all of the feedback to my last blog. In it I had related that I was at a sports bar that night that featured girls that dressed like sluts. At no time did I make the suggestions that all girls that dress sexy are sluts. I think there are lines that can be crossed though, and these particular waitresses looked pretty slutty. William, I agree with you. The whole "paying their way through college" thing seems like a bad excuse to me most of the time. Dave, some people would take what you're saying a step further (or several steps further) and suggest that strippers do what they do out of confidence in their sexuality, and that there's nothing wrong with that either. I don't mind tight clothing or some make-up, but again, there are lines to be crossed. Mike, you're right; we shouldn't judge people by what they look like. A girl may dress too provocatively, but she has a tonne of worth and isn't a terrible person. ....Moving on, again....I'm in a jazz phase again. I tend to go back and forth between folk/country and jazz, with a little bit of rock as well sometimes. Lately its been Sinatra, Diana Krall, Bing, Johnny Hartman, etc. And now it's bedtime. More later.

      It's Thursday, so I had the day off as usual. Went to volunteering at St. Mary's early in the afternoon. My job is to visit people, and I enjoy it for the most part. Most of the people I visit are in their 70's or 80's, so they can't exactly run away from me if I'm boring as hell. Cool. And if I can work my way into at least 2 or 3 wills before my tenure at the hospital is up, all the better.... KIDDING. Then I came home and practised for guitar lesson. Earlier in the day I was practising and cut my finger on a guitar string, which either means I have very fragile fingers or it's a badge of honour. The lesson early this evening went well. On my way back from my lesson, I walked downtown Kitchener here to catch a bus back home, and a bunch of cars went by honking their horns and waving flags. I had no idea what country the flags represented, but it turns out it was the Portuguese flag; they had beaten England earlier in the day in soccer. Tonight I went out for a couple drinks with some old college friends (Mike Washburn, my first college roommate and all around cool guy, Gwyn Horscroft, Dan and Faith Grace). Gwyn, Mike and I went to Front Row McInnis in Waterloo and the place was packed. I haven't frequented too many establishments that boast waitresses with tight shirts and shorts, and this was one of them. I just find it kind of odd that that's still accepted so widely in 2004. I mean, they can have girls dressed all sexy without kind of looking like sluts. Speaking of apparel, am I the only one that finds a girl wearing overalls really attractive? If I am, I'm comfortable with that, I just do.

       urlLink    Less than a week from the federal election here in Canada. Can you guess where my vote is going? For those of you not familiar with Canadian politics, there are 3 main parties in our system. The New Democratic Party is on the left, the governing Liberals are towards the center, and the Conservative Party is on the right. For the past couple weeks its been looking like the Conservatives were going to win a minority government, which may still very well happen. But there's hope. This comes from the front page of today's national newspaper The Globe and Mail: "The Ipsos-Reid poll, conducted for The Globe and Mail and CTV, finds that support for the Liberals has rebounded to 34 per cent of decided voters, while Stephen Harper's Conservatives have dropped to 28 per cent, a level of support similar to what they enjoyed at the start of the campaign." The NDP is holding steady at 16 per cent. Personally, I'm hoping for a Liberal minority. They've been in power for a decade now, but may lose it because of a scandal where they wasted millions of dollars to a bungled sponsorship program. This has left a lot of people angry, and I'm not happy about it either. However, I'd rather keep them in government than see a Stephen Harper-led country. I think George Bush would be pleased to see Harper elected. Personally, my vote will go to the left-wing NDP, led by Jack Layton. They're big into social issues, like homelessness, poverty, the environment. They don't have a hope of winning the election, but if the Liberals win a minority, they'd probably have to lean on the NDP in order to run the government. I like the NDP, they seem to be with the common people, giving a voice to those less fortunate. The important thing is that people get out and actually vote. I'm sick and tired of hearing people my age saying "I'm not going to vote because I'm not informed and I don't really care." To these people I say "You're lucky to live in a country where you have the right to vote. Why don't you take an hour and instead of downloading music or reading sports news on the web, go to the party websites, get informed, and VOTE." Only 25% of people 18 to 25 voted in the 2000 election. Pitiful...  &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    O thou feathered caretaker of my toddlerdom, who once did sit upon a perch inside my humble abode. My mere and my papa didst rescue you from a rugged establishment called "pet store" before I was in my mother's womb. Thou didst chirp when she pluggeth in her hair dryer and pointed it toward her head. Thou didst gracefully bend down and sip from thine water basin, slaking thine thirst. Thou didst live until thou werst approximately 17 or perhaps 18 earth years old. On that dark day we didst observe you swaying back and forth dizzingly on thine wooden thingamabob. Shortly thereafter we observed again as thou shaketh with convulsions on the bottom of thine dwelling place. And we didst mourn for thee as mine father buried thee in an old electric razor box in mine backyard. Oh, I remember thee. I remember thee. I remember thee.

      It's just after 2 in the morning now and the combination of the music on Folk Alley and the Steamwhistle Pilsener is coming together as sort of a lullaby, gently urging me to go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep little Marky. Ok, that's enough. Today was an eventful day. Among other things I went to my guitar lesson early this evening, and I think I faked my way through that ok. Then I went into work to host in the dining room/bar for 3 hours. Again, if they want to pay me 10 bucks and change to stand around and chat with my co-workers, they can go right ahead.   Last night I got together with an old friend from college, Gwyn. I lost a bet to Gwyn a year or more ago, and owed her dinner and a movie, so we went out last night (I would have went out with you anyways Gwyn!) It was her choice what movie we saw, so she picked The Terminal, Tom Hanks' new movie. Well, when we got to the theatre entrance with our popcorn, etc, two security guards with these wands were at the door. We thought it must be a movie gimmick (terminal, airport security, thus the guards), but then realized that they were checking for camcorders and the like. When we got through the doors (after I had to remove my steel prosthetic left nipple), the place was packed. We didn't want to sit way up front, so we decided to go see Gwyn's second choice.  You guessed it, The Stepford Wives. Now, I admittedly like so-called "chick flicks," (perhaps you've read previous posts containing glowing references to Julia Roberts), but I was quite skeptical about this one. The reviews have been pretty bad for it. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. Funny, funny movie. Also quite disturbing at some points. But overall, worth seeing.   On a completely different subject, something that really annoys me is when girls wear pants with words on their asses. You know the ones; they say stuff like "Princess" or "Foxy Lady" or "Hottie." This drives me nuts! Girls get all upset when they hear about a guy staring at their ass but then they invite it by wearing these pants. The phrases aren't even clever. Perhaps I'll get some paint and write something unique on the ass of my jeans like the entire Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms or the words to an Alanis song, or "CALL THIS NUMBER IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT MY WALKING."  Anyways, enough for now. Bedtime.

      So I'm thinking now about what labels do to people. For instance, if a person is identified as a cancer patient, perhaps people will start treating them differently at parties, when really all they want is to be treated normally. Or when someone is identified as the President of the United States, they are regarded as perhaps the most powerful person alive (insert Bush joke here). If an upstanding minister in a small community is caught with child porn on his computer, they are labeled sick and in need of help (and indeed they  are  in need of help). Labels are powerful things. And the question I have is this: How do we identify ourselves? What labels do we wear? You know those stickers that you wear when you go to conventions or meetings that say "Hello, my name is..." If you had to fill in the blank, what would you put? (Hopefully the first thing that would come to mind is your name, or else you might have serious problems). But what one word would you use if you had to sum up who you are to other people, and if you were completely honest? Unfortunately I think for many people, including an awful lot of religious people, this word would be "Sinner." Some of these people would quickly write "saved by grace" underneath or beside their name, while some couldn't write that because what they experience in this life could hardly be described as salvation. Whatever the case, the premise remains the same. According to fundamentalist Christian thought, every human being was labeled a sinner at the moment they popped out of their mother's womb. It's like one of the nurses in the delivery room was holding an ink pad and a stamp beside the bed, and applied the stamp to the baby's forehead as soon as they appeared. I think this has a profoundly disturbing effect on many many people. We are originally flawed, we are dirty, we are not up to par, we are bad. Sure, there might be a way to become better, or good, or to escape the eternal wrath of God, but that still leaves us with the original label, the original stamp of being Sinner. I honestly don't agree with this thinking (can you tell)? I do not believe in original sin in the way it is often taught in evangelical circles. We did not all become bad, dirty people as a result of Adam and Eve's actions in Eden. There is no need for a label. I'm not sure at this point if I believe we are all born good, or just that we are born and we make life what we make it. But I'm sure that we are not born Sinner. Years ago I used to sing in church; one song that I liked and sang was called "Goodbye To Me." Read the first and second verses and chorus:  Lord I want to be a servant of the King And I want my life to be inspired by all you bring But for this I must die And sometimes it's hard to understand the reasons why  Isn't there some way I can save a piece of me Isn't there some how you can take this cup from me Lord I hear you whispering that this is how it has to be But my God it's awfully hard to say goodbye to me  (Chorus) Hold me close as I say goodbye to me Let my heart know that you are all I need I'll stay right here on my knees  Until I have the strength to say goodbye to me 'cause I'm tired of living somewhere in between My love for you and my love for me So take whatever's left of me I sacrifice it Lord to Thee Goodbye to Me. (David Robertson)  My first thought as I read these words for the first time in years is that I want to go jump off a bridge, or a high-rise building. I am a wretch, I am so bad, God. I know I'm not worthy, but if you can make something out of this scum, please do it. I'm ready to say goodbye to me and somehow try to kill myself in my head and soul so that you can make some use of me.   Do you get this feeling? Maybe. Maybe not. In any case, I don't think this is reality whatsoever. Rather than trying to commit this sort of spiritual suicide or beating ourselves up daily over what awful people we are, what if we saw ourselves as Loved, or even as Good. Do we as human beings sin? Yes. Are we in need of some sort of divine presence in our lives? Yes, and many religions and movements help us to experience the divine instead of living a life sinning and being unwhole.  But I don't think that sin is something at our very core. A popular older song puts it this way: "I'm just an old chunk of coal, but I'm gonna be a diamond someday." Sorry, I don't buy it. What a radical difference it would make in our lives if we saw that we are not inherently bad or evil people, but rather people with no strikes against us. Maybe we'd learn to relax in the presence of God rather than trying to live a life of performing act upon act to be acceptable.   I don't know how I identify myself at this point in my life. But for this very moment it's: "Hello, my name is...Tired."   Goodnight.

      I ended up in front of the TV for longer than I wanted to be just now. But how could I resist Julia Roberts in Runaway Bride. You have to love TBS Superstation for replaying movies over and over and over again. Julia is absolutely gorgeous in that movie.  Anyways, we had a tornado warning here for awhile in the middle of the afternoon. I sometimes talk about how I would like to see a tornado, but I found myself kind of fearful today when I heard the warning. Oh well. We got a small rumbling of thunder and a few drops of rain and that's about it.  I am very skeptical these days when someone says "God told me to do this," or "God told me NOT to do that." For instance, "God told me to go to college instead of university" or God told me that I would not be harmed on my upcoming trip to Saudi Arabia." Did they receive a call on their cell phone? Did God send them a special little something in their in-box? (I realize this sounds like I'm mocking certain religious thought...I've had a fairly bad day; so keep that in mind, or just stop reading now).  I don't really doubt that there are people who are quite in tune with God and feel some sort of 'pull' one way or the other when they are wading through life and making decisions. But I wonder how many times 'God' is really themselves or some other factor in their life. For instance, perhaps God has nothing to do with the persons leaning towards college instead of university. Perhaps it is the persons unwillingness to bow to their parents preference for university. And perhaps it is not God telling the person that they will not be harmed when they go to Saudi Arabia. Maybe they're merely trying to convince themselves that they'll be alright after hearing awful stories on the news. I think people should be careful how they use the "God told me so" phrases. And for some reason a lot of us get stuck in the belief that God is some King above the sky ruling with an iron fist demanding our acts of obedience and our servanthood. Sometimes we look over our shoulder wondering if God would want us to this or that, and if we'll be 2nd-class people if we take this action as opposed to that action. I think in this regard we've got God all wrong. God is not some far-off being watching us "from a distance," but rather the Spirit which is in us and all around us, if only we'd pay attention and listen for it. I don't think God wants to be our Ruler so much as to be our friend. This authoritarian God has to go, at least it does for me. Some people think "well, if I do this God won't be happy with me," of "if I do that God won't bless me." Did you ever think that God wants you to be happy? Did you ever think that God never intended a relationship with him/her to look like a child's relationship with Santa Claus? "He sees you when you're sleeping, He knows when you're awake. He knows if you've been bad or good, so be good for goodness sake."  This is a shame. God is present everywhere, but he's not a judge. And we shouldn't worry that we are loving someone more than we love God. We miss the point when we say "I'll try to love you God, more than I love Jane, or my mother, or my son." I think we experience God more fully as we love those around us. They aren't separate to me. Again, God is present everywhere. God is present as the sun sets over the lake, God is present in a really good kiss (thank God that he is not restricted to being present in a good kiss or I wouldn't be experiencing God much these days!). God is present when the baby on the bus looks in your direction and smiles. For that matter, God is also present when the baby won't stop crying, or when you fail a really important test, etc etc etc. I think I've been rambling a lot in this blog, but this is a blog and not a term paper. To sum up:  1) God is not a Person in the Sky demanding our perfection 2) God probably couldn't care less if we dated Jane or Leanne 3) RELAX! YOU'RE NOT A BAD PERSON THAT NEEDS TO GROVEL! Realize that you're a wonderful creation and God is all around you. 4) Next time you kiss someone tell them they remind you of God - they'll be impressed.

      It's around 1 in the morning, and the rain is letting up now. I worked the usual 3 till 11 shift at the hotel, and we got a decent thunderstorm just as my shift was ending. I love thunderstorms, which is a real change from when I was a kid. I hated them when I was a kid, and we used to get some doozies (there's a strange word) down by the lake. Now I can't get enough of them. It was a slow night at work, so all there was to do was joke around with Fabio, my co-worker, and throw plastic lemons at other co-workers, namely Steve. We're spoiled at the hotel when it comes to food. My friend Nikki works as a cook in the kitchen, and makes good pasta, though tonight I asked for a chicken caesar salad. And then later on I had some very very good prime rib and chicken - leftovers from a function earlier in the evening. When I came home I watched a rebroadcast of Larry King's interview with Ronald Reagan back in 1990. I had to watch the whole hour - Reagan was such a nice man. And now before bed I thought I should add something to my blog, and I'm listening to some good music on  urlLink folkalley.com . If you like folk music, you should check it out. Have a good day everybody.

      Yesterday I was in Wal-Mart because I had to pick up a few items. These items were: soap, new Mach 3 blades for my razor, and shaving cream. For a few months now, I've been buying Barbasol shaving cream instead of Gillette, just for the reason that the can looks older-style, and I like that. It's also a bit cheaper. But the quality isn't as good as Gillette shaving cream, and the can of Barbasol I had was clogged or something, so it was looking like melted vanilla ice cream when it came out of the can. So back to Gillette I went. And then I realized. Gillette pretty much has the monopoly on men's shaving goods. I know there are other brands like Schick that have commercials on TV, but does anyone really buy Schick? I think most guys buy Gillette products. I have a Gillette Mach 3 razor, I have Gillette shaving cream, I even have Gillette after-shave (though I seldom use it). Gillette says it's "the best a man can get," and while I don't like their domination over the male portion of North American society, I have to admit that they have pretty good products. Sometimes you get what you pay for. Like soap. For awhile I was buying the generic brand that Wal-Mart pumps out, but its just not as good as Ivory. So back to Ivory for me. Anyways, that's about all for today.

       urlLink    I was sad today to hear of the death of Ronald Reagan. I was only 3 when he became President and 11 when he left office, but I always liked Reagan. He seemed like such a genuine man, and kind. He had a simplicity about him, but he was smart. Unlike the current U.S. President, who has a simplicity about him, but...(okay, this is about Reagan, so I'll be nice). I've felt bad the last few years when I've seen a special on TV about him, and he didn't even know Nancy anymore. 10 years dealing with Alzheimer's must have been devastating for her. I've often thought that must be a horrible disease to have, and for the family to cope with. Hopefully both of them can rest easier now.&nbsp; urlLink

      Last night I walked home from work at the hotel around 11 o'clock. It was an excellent night outside. Extremely foggy. Just like I like overcast days, I also enjoy the fog. Some people don't like it though; they say it creates a lot of mist opportunities...  Exciting news this morning as I perused CTV.ca. According to reports, Julia Roberts is pregnant with twins. Yes, I will proudly admit that I have seen and enjoyed Notting Hill, Runaway Bride, Erin Brockovich, etc. I guess every time she goes to the movie theatre now, she'll have to prepare for a twin billing...  I have the day off today, so it's lots of coffee and reading for me. Nice.

      It's now around 2:30 in the morning, and I'm all comfy. I'd be more comfy if it was a bitterly cold winter's night and I could be wearing my blue flannel pajamas, but just as it is I'm comfy. I have my chocolate raspberry vodka concoction with me again, and I'm listening to CBC Radio online. For my American friends, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is&nbsp;a government owned corporation here. TV, radio,  urlLink web . And during this time of the night, they tune into radio stations from around the world. I think&nbsp;I'm listening to some Czech radio station right now, but it's ending so we'll see what comes up next. I used to listen to CBC radio a lot when I was working midnights at a gas bar about 3 or 4 years ago. CBC, and also a program on another station called Lovers and other Strangers. Its &nbsp;got to be the sappiest radio program I've ever heard. This guy with an ultra-deep voice reads sappy poetry in between just-as-sappy songs by artists such as Rod Stewart and Backstreet Boys. Speaking of Rod Stewart, he did a cover of Sometimes When We Touch, and for some reason (SIDENOTE: Now I'm listening to "The Voice of Russia, fun times ahead!) I keep singing it while I'm at work. But I don't really know any of the lyrics past "the honesty's too much," so I just stop after that. I'm sure my co-workers are thankful for that. Not because I have a bad voice, just because the song is so sappy. I used to sing so much at the hotel , especially in the kitchen, that a couple people actually asked one of my friends that is a cook there, if I was gay. I found this interesting. Are they inferring that any male who sings is gay? Or any guy that sings at work? I'm not sure. I wasn't offended at all, but my friend could attest to the fact that I am straight since I dated one of her roommates.  &nbsp;  Anyways, where was I? I don't think I was anywhere, and that's okay. I hesitantly rented "Big Fish" the other night, after hearing mixed reviews. I am very glad that I went ahead and watched it. It's&nbsp; probably the best movie I've seen in a long time, and I wish I had went to see it in the theatre.  &nbsp;  There's some odd ducks that stay at the hotel sometimes. For instance, a month ago we had "The Puker." This man would come into the restaurant at 3 in the afternoon and order the soup of the day, &nbsp;a New York steak, and a dessert, and a carafe of coffee. He did this everyday for like 2 weeks, and one day he got out of his chair and proceeded to vomit (that's a gross word, but it's effective and kind of funky) all over the restaurant carpet. I also heard that he relieved himself on his bed. Strange.&nbsp; And now we have this lady&nbsp;staying with us&nbsp;that&nbsp;obviously has some problems and she sounds really dreamy whenever she calls down for room service. She orders the same thing every night. BBQ Ribs, potatoes, vegetables, bread, lots of Becel margarine because she's lactose intolerant, and 3 cans of gingerale. Last night she asked me if we had any desserts. Of course we do, so I proceeded to tell her what was available.&nbsp; Cheesecake, Baked Alaska, strawberry rhubarb pie, etc. And then I told her we had a Hot Fudge Browny.&nbsp; By the sound of her voice either she had never imagined she could ever receive desserts through room service, or she was having an experience of orgasmic proportions.&nbsp; In any case, I won't be sorry to see her go, though she does make my night interesting. Oh,  urlLink this  is where I work, eat your heart out. I'm sick of it.  &nbsp;  Perhaps I should get to bed. Those of you who are still reading this, I hope you have a great day!&nbsp;

       urlLink    The Seattle Mariners announced today that they have designated 1B John Olerud (left) and C Pat Borders for assignment. Seattle has 10 days to release, trade, or send them to the minors. Effectively Olerud's career with the Mariners is done. I'm not sure if Pat will go to the minors again or not, or if he'll finally retire. Fellow Blue Jay fans will remember watching these two during the glory years of 92-93, with John taking the batting title one year, and Pat winning the World Series MVP, chewing tobacco and all. John is 35 and wants to play somewhere this year; we'll see what Pat decides - he's 41.  All the best to two classy guys.

      This is one of those wonderful times when things come together for a "moment." It is shortly after 2 in the morning, and I'm listening to folk music on  urlLink folkalley.com , I'm drinking a concoction of Smirnoff Raspberry, dark creme de cacao and milk, the fan is blowing refreshing cool air on me, and absolute best of all, it's starting to thunder and lightning. I wish it was an hour earlier, since I have to get up and go out for breakfast with my friend Will. But oh well, I have the whole day off tomorrow, so I can have a nap.   I worked from 3 till shortly after midnight tonight, and had a good night. I usually don't bartend on weekdays, so it was kind of strange. But it was fun. It was the three amigos. Dragan the Serbian, Fabio the Italian, and me, the... the Canadian. Sometimes I am envious of friends that have a strong ethnic background. I've always just thought of myself as a Canadian, which I'm very proud of. But I should look farther back into my family history. I think Alward is an English surname, and my mother has Dutch roots way back.  Anyways, tonight I walked home from work around 12:30am or so, instead of taking a cab. I had my discman with me that I listened to on my way to work this afternoon, but after starting to unravel my earphones just outside the hotel, I decided to just walk home without music. Sometimes I think we shut out the world, shut out life by shoving earphones in our ears and turning up the volume. Do you think so too? I think that its important to listen to what our hearts and minds and God is telling us, and I for one seldom do this as of late. (OH SWEET, MY "MOMENT" JUST GOT BETTER - Emmylou Harris just came on the air!) OK, where was I? Don't get me wrong, I don't think our conscience, or what we hear from ourselves is necessarily the voice of God. A lot of people have thought they've heard "God" telling them to kill someone, or telling them they are terrible people, and so forth, and it certainly has not been the voice of God. But I think that we can sense God sometimes, and we can also listen to what our hearts are saying to ourselves. Maybe its "You need to change this about your life," or "You really need to read more," or, if we're lucky "You are loved, you are a good person." But I think it's important to listen to what is being said in the silence, if anything is to be said at the moment. Tonight I was distracted by a Sarah Harmer song in my head. And now, with fiddle music playing, a fan against me, and a couple drinks in me, I'm going to bed. Goodnight.

      On April 18, 2002, a group of Canadian soldiers serving in Afghanistan were performing a night-time live-fire military excercise near Kandahar. U.S. Air Force Major Harry Schmidt and Major William Umbach were flying over the area in an F-16, and thought they were viewing hostile fire from the ground, although all pilots had been told that the Canadians were holding military excercises in the area. They requested permission to fire at the target, were told by their commanders to hold fire while more information was obtained, then they proceeded to roll in "in self-defence," dropped down to 10, 000 feet and dropped a 250 kilogram laser-guided bomb, killing 4 Canadian soldiers and injuring 8 others. An American report on the incident made some key points, including that it was caused by "the failure of the two pilots to execute appropriate flight discipline which resulted in a violation of the rules of engagement and inappropriate use of lethal force." Justice has not been served. Neither pilot was court-martialled. Major Umbach received a reprimand and retired from the U.S. Air Force, and just a few days ago, Major Schmidt, the man who dropped the bomb, was found guilty of dereliction of duty, which adds up to a loss of just over $5,000 US, and he will be allowed to return to service in the Illinois Air National Guard, just not as a pilot. This is unbelievable and absolutely outrageous. 4 Canadians lose their lives because 2 pilots didn't listen to orders (and in an F-16 at their range they could have just left the area anyway), and they get off with reprimands. One is allowed to just retire, and the other loses a few thousand bucks and remains in service. This is bullshit. And, oh, I forgot to mention that Major Schmidt thinks the fine is too harsh and is appealing it. Although I'm angry that they got off so easy, I'm perhaps even more angry that no-one in the Canadian government is publicly standing up to this injustice. Paul Martin himself, or at the least Bill Graham the foreign affairs minister, should be front and center and mad as hell. When will our government get some balls?   Those who lost their lives:    Sgt. Marc Leger,  29, of Lancaster, Ontario  Cpl. Ainsworth Dyer,  24, of Montreal, Quebec  Pte. Richard Green,  21, of Mill Cove, Nova Scotia  Pte. Nathan Smith,  27, of Porter's Lake, Nova Scotia

      Ah yes; yet another useless press conference today by the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge, again warning the American people that Al-Qaeda is planning an attack. Here's an excerpt from it:    "We lack precise knowledge about time, place and method of attack," he said. "But along with the CIA, FBI and other agencies, we are actively working to gain that knowledge."    So, you have basically nothing new to tell the American people; you don't know when, where, or how they're planning on attacking. THEN WHY THE HELL ARE YOU HOLDING A NEWS CONFERENCE! Hmmm, you're not trying to keep the people in a state of fear, are you? You're not trying to deflect attention away from the opposing political party that just made the headlines by nominating a VP candidate, are you? No, couldn't be. Nuh-uh...  Kerrying on with politics, I think it would have been cool if McCain would have been JFK's running mate. The dream team. Oh well, I really like John Edwards, and I think its a good team. He comes from a poor family while Kerry was born into wealth. He has a tonne of charisma while Kerry can seem kind of boring to people sometimes. Personally I like both Kerry/Edwards and I think they'd make a hell of a Pres/VP team.  On to other things... I ordered pizza tonight, online again - which I still find really cool or really pathetic depending on my mood. After I had clicked on the toppings I wanted and sent the order, on the e-receipt I noticed that I would be receiving a "free side of coleslaw" with my pizza. Oh yay! Pizza AND coleslaw all in one night! Who the hell eats coleslaw with pizza? I mean, I can understand garlic bread or something (which I was supposed to receive free as well because I ordered online), but coleslaw??? Strange. Oh well, the delivery guy forgot to bring it anyways. Perhaps he had a secret coleslaw craving on the way to my apartment. I also don't like the word coleslaw.  I went to visit my brother and sister-in-law, Dave and Lauretta, at their place in Flesherton, Ontario on Wednesday along with my Dad. Had a great time. They took us around to several scenic places that had waterfalls. Then we had BBQ chicken, and maple ice cream, good stuff. We also went into Owen Sound and went to the mall there, which served as another opportunity to view one of my Dad's oddities. Don't get me wrong here. I love my Dad. We've had more than our share of ups and downs in my life, but we have a good relationship now and we had a good time the last couple days. But with the passing of time he's become, how do you put this...eccentric.  He's reached that age where he wears t-shirts with cats on them, along with cat buttons. He'll also slow down at a green light, and he sends letters to me with drawings of farm animals on the envelopes, among other things. Well, while we were in the mall yesterday and were in the bookstore, he wanted to show something to my brother, who was at the other end of the store at the time. Rather than walk over to him and get him to come look at the item (it was on a computer screen so he couldn't have just taken it over to show my brother), all of a sudden I hear "DAVE!...DAVE!" It was like we were on a spacious rural street rather than in a small, busy city bookstore. Embarrassed, I politely "shhh-ed" in Dad's direction. Politely though. Maybe I'll become eccentric when I'm older too, but I hope it doesn't happen till I'm around 80. My Dad is 56. The drive from my brother's place back to Kitchener here is about an hour and a half. At one point I put some Fred Eaglesmith, a Canadian bluegrass/folk artist, on the stereo, and I thought Dad would like it, but by the look on his face he was enjoying it about as much as a kidney stone...okay, that's a bit of an exageration...  My Dad did send me a great joke in one of his letters recently though:   A pair of jumper cables walks into a bar. The bartender says, "Ok, I'll serve you, just don't start anything."

       urlLink    I love stories like this. Police have confirmed that remains that  were found in the woods near Gully Lake in Nova Scotia on June 27 are those of Willard Kitchener MacDonald, 87 years of age. Willard lived in a small cabin in the woods for 50 years, and rarely ventured out  to town. The birth certificate found on him said he was born in Massachusetts in 1916. He jumped a troop train during the Second World War and settled in the woods, where he was known as the Hermit of Gully Lake. He lived there for 50 years. He sold animal pelts to support his simple lifestyle, and he played guitar, fiddled, and sang. He was last seen November 30th, and died from natural causes coupled with hypothermia. Although he didn't venture into town much, he had some friends, and was a friendly man. I just thought I'd write about him here.

      This is from  urlLink globeandmail.com :   "An Ontario couple have been sentenced to nine months in jail for keeping their two adopted sons chained in cages over a 13-year period when they were not in school.  The couple – the boys' 42-year-old biological aunt and her 52-year-old husband – pleaded guilty in January to two counts each of assault with a weapon, forcible confinement and failing to provide the necessities of life.  The horrors they endured at the couple's farmhouse in Blackstock, near Port Perry, were uncovered when three family members contacted the children's aid society. Police and child-welfare workers descended on the family home on June 4, 2001.  They found a 15-year-old boy curled up in a cage fashioned from a baby's crib. The cage was strapped to the wall and padlocked.  His brother, 14, walked out from a room that contained a second cage.  The boys, who were one and two years old when adopted, told a horrific story of being beaten, forced to sleep in the cages, often given only buttered bread for dinner, of eating their feces to avoid being punished for having an accident and of drinking their urine when deprived of water.  The boys did not learn until after they had been removed from the couple's custody that their biological mother died when they were toddlers and that the couple they considered their parents are their aunt and uncle."    These people got 9 MONTHS for keeping children locked up in a cage for years and beating them? Unbelievable. This has got to be one of the most ludicrous sentences I've ever heard of.

      Sometimes it's tempting to think that one size fits all when it comes to understanding or relating to the divine. Indeed I used to believe this. While I thought that people could experience God in various ways such as music or nature or different worship styles on Sunday mornings, it had to fall within the boundaries of Christianity and Christian doctrine. I don't believe this anymore (though I don't like to use "anymore" since my beliefs or ideas are still in a formative stage). I don't believe this at this point in my life, that's better. God is not a person that we have a photograph of and can look at and say "this is exactly what God is like." Therefore to say that one can regulate access to God by specific doctrines seems kind of foolish to me, to be honest. I'm not trying to offend here. It just seems to me like trying to nail jelly to the wall. There is much more to God than any human can ever imagine and anyone who says that they have him/her completely figured out is off-base. Maybe you agree, maybe not. I have a problem with the thought that God is only accesible through one religion, or one man, Jesus. I believe that there are millions of fervently God-seeking Muslims, Hindu's, Jews, etc. Are all these people blind and deceived? No. Many of these people experience God and relate to God. God does not belong to Christians. It's convenient to believe this though - heck, we live on a continent where Christianity in some form is the prevalent religion. The reason we are so rooted in Christian thought is because we grew up here, in Christian churches and Christian homes, and Christian youth groups, and sometimes in Christian class in school. It's very different in other areas of the world. The world outside of North America and Europe is not all in the dark. The people are not all deceived or less enlightened. There are wonderful and faithful people that adhere to other religions and doctrines. I am glad that I grew up in a home and church and youth group that encouraged me to seek God. But I realize now that the beliefs I grew up with are not the only true way to God.   Time for bed...

       urlLink    Had a great birthday yesterday, thanks for all the birthday wishes guys. I went to Victoria Park here in Kitchener with my Mom and Sharon and Ben (close friends - more like family). Then I had an absolutely wonderful time at Dwayne and Murray's house in Cambridge. Steak dinner, and lots of beverages. Then a few of us went out to Paddy Flaherty's in Waterloo. Michelle and Dwayne (at the front of the pic) are both co-workers and friends of mine, and Terry my roommate is the dude with the thumbs up. All in all a great day. Getting up this morning wasn't exactly fun, but I managed to do so, and had a good breakfast with my Dad. Anyways, naptime!

       urlLink    I'm 26 today, and I'll be seeing family this weekend; I'm glad for that. It's interesting how things change, and I'm grateful that they've changed for the better. My childhood wasn't exactly the happiest time for the most part, and there was a time about 3 years back when I didn't even speak to my Dad for months on end. Now we talk regularly and we'll be talking over bacon and eggs Saturday morning. I'll see Mom tomorrow morning, and its been awhile so that'll be really nice. My brother Dave and my sis-in-law Lauretta sent me a Johnny Cash/Willie Nelson CD, which I'm listening to now as I write, and I hope to see them before too long. I'll have to bus up to their town sometime... And I sort of wish I still had curly blonde hair.

      It's shortly after 3 in the morning and I'm heading to bed shortly. I just got in from having a couple drinks with some co-workers on a patio by the hotel. I didn't really feel like having beer at the start, so I thought I'd try Grand Marnier. Yuck. I promptly asked the waitress for some water so I could dilute it. Then I switched to Baileys. Then I switched to Sleeman Honey Brown, my beer of choice that's brewed about 15 or 20 minutes from Kitchener, in Guelph, Ontario. Sounds like I got hammered, but nah, only 3 shots, and 3 beers. Not much. Then my friend Amanda and I went across the street to the gas station so she could buy smokes, and I got one of those pre-packaged sandwiches that I've bought tens of times before. They're not bad, at least not the pizza subs.   Moving on...  Think of the best time of your life. The best experience you've ever had. What was it? I have two that immediately come to mind, one of which I will share. Years ago I used to travel with about 12 others or so to a native reserve in New Brunswick here in Canada. Esgenoopititj, or Burnt Church, is the community's name. It took 17 hours to drive there, that is if you didn't stop. We went there on Christian missionary trips, and while my views on missionary work have changed, I'm glad I went. I loved it. We used to hold kids clubs during the day, and little native kids would jump up on our backs and we'd carry them around the reserve. Again, I loved it. I had never considered myself really great with kids, but they didn't care. They just wanted attention and thought it was cool that we were there. My moment was courtesy of a little girl named Shahila (some native people have such beautiful names). She was probably around 5 at the time, and I just remember carrying her on my back on the reserve, and her laughing as I moved back and forth, pretending like I was going to drop her (of course I never would). The sound of a little girl named Shahila giggling in my ear is one of the experiences of my life I consider the most precious. She needed me to be there to pay attention to her, I needed to know I was needed. It all came together for a moment I won't ever forget.
