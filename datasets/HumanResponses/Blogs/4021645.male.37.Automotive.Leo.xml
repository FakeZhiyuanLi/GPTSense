      The next step in the “War on Terror” should be to restructure our foreign aid program, not to “buy” the friendship of the Muslim world, but to demonstrate to the jihadists just what life is like without free dollars.   There is a great yearning on the part of Muslim Supremacists to build their Caliphate without intrusion or involvement with the West and its hedonistic ways and influences. My contention is that we should let them have at it. In a few short years their children will be wondering why the 16th century seemed so appealing to their fathers while the rest of the world has moved on without them. Then there will be hell to pay. Not here… but there.   And Iran is what we need to watch and learn from, as the first few steps of backlash against the Islamic Supremacists are furtively being made.       Why, exactly, are we propping up a series of medieval dictatorships with billions of dollars of nanny-state welfare, spending for their protection with American lives and treasure, while they build Wahabian schools, vote against us in the United Nations, refuse to participate in dealing with terror cells, and foster repressive medias that teach hatred of America and promote death for the West?   The greatest foreign aid policy move we can make now is to let the markets determine the truth about these failed states and backwards regimes. We need to turn the restrictions on oil exploration and development in the western hemisphere off.   In the past, foreign aid has been given two justifications.   First, we are told, smaller nations in the backwaters of the world, need our help to feed their people, fight back disease, and develop their economies.  This would be a great reason if the truth only bore itself out in the long term results.  “Of the 77 countries with the most repressed economies in the world, 34 have been receiving U.S. foreign aid for periods ranging from 35 years to 52 years. Of these 34 countries, 13 are poorer today than they were in 1965 and 10 others are just as poor as they were three decades ago. If foreign assistance was an effective development tool, every one of the 34 countries should have shown some improvement.” The Heritage Foundation  Secondly in the Cold War we often floated the idea that if we put a foreign-aid ring around communism, the poverty and despair that fed the ranks of communism would be dealt with.  This would seem to be a good idea, but that’s not even a portion of what killed the Soviets. It wasn’t until renegades in the Warsaw Pact started to fold that the Soviet Union was shown to be a pathetic giant. It wasn’t until the fatal flaws of collectivism were allowed to take their natural course – without the peculiar vision of capitalist economies keeping it from collapse with infusions of aid (justified by the fear that communism in its death rattle would strike out at us) – that we started to watch that giant fold under the strain of its own dead weight.  Foreign aid, either as altruism or an effort at a strategic approach has never approached the value of free and open markets in determining the constitution of the neighborhood of nations.      Besides, at some point we must address the fact that “approximately 70 cents out of every foreign-aid dollar never makes it overseas: It funds the very bureaucracy so piously arguing for preserving foreign aid.” The Heritage Foundation  (the material quoted here is not “news” – the article used as a background here was written eight years ago)  Let them rise or fail on their own merits. The United States must stop being every other nation’s handy excuse for their shortcomings. With free American dollars, technical expertise, armed might, and access pulled out from under these regimes, we set the paradigm.   After the mission is accomplished in Iraq, this should be the next front we open.   urlLink (Reference)

      The father of the executed American telecommunications worker has now gone on record as saying that his son died “for the sins of George Bush and Donald Rumsfeld.”  One can understand the level of grief and anguish Berg’s family must be going through at the loss of their son, at the start of his life and obviously an interesting young man who had a bright future. And if anyone has a right to speak their mind on the public killing of someone it understandably should be the victim’s family – and certainly his father.  But here is where my compassion – which is in limited supply to begin with – ends.  Berg didn’t die for the sins of George Bush and Donald Rumsfeld like some modern Christ atoning for a larger evil. His death atoned for nothing in particular. It was just an act of brutality and vengeance, pure and simple.  With more and more of the story unfolding we find still more evidence of the misguided and flawed logic that is in the minds of Muslim Supremacists. Berg, if anything, was a friend to muslims. Schoolmates at the U. of Oklahoma. He held them in no particular disdain and harbored no prejudice against them. He seems to have been in Iraq to work or find work, but in any case to help with the rebuilding of the country. So the geniuses running the terror cells in Iraq more than likely murdered someone more inclined to be an ally.  But even more foolish, and more injudicious than the scattered logic of the murderers is the crippled reasoning of Berg’s own father, who put the killing of his son at the feet of the President and the Secretary of Defense.  Berg was in Iraq of his own volition. He had been told by authorities it was dangerous for an American to move about Iraq without due regard for the realities of the situation (as if anyone actually had to be told this. In fact, a person would have to be some special kind of stupid not to realize this).  But Mr Berg’s idea that American policy wielded the sword that killed his son, is tantamount to saying he is in tacit agreement with the his son’s murderer, which makes him in an odd way complicit with the act.  If the victim’s father is not just being led by grief – which we can allow for – then he is certainly a babbling idiot. Berg was his father’s son – as all men are their father’s sons – and in his upbringing there was obviously some lack in the lessons of discernment and judgment.  The killers were muslim terrorists. He died of their actions. They are responsible for killing Berg. Period.  But if an erroneous conclusion could place the blame for this murder at the feet of the President and the Secretary of Defense, then a stronger case – using the same twisted logic -  could be made to say that Berg died because of the malfunctioning of a father in not teaching his son the value of common sense.  So Berg died for the sins of his own father, who more obviously than the government, was a miserable failure where it counted most.

      Strategic non-intervention is a call-back to a traditional American stance long before we felt we should be the policemen of the world, but it is not oblivious to the concept of the protection of our interests and all the requirements of a mega power in a global economy.  When confronted with the appearance of chaos the best way to bring order is to grab hold of stable data. Meaning, what is it that is true here?  One thing that's true is there's a built-in defense in the minds of Islamic extremists --- death is actually a reward. The hypocrisy though is the same as a lot of religions; if death for a cause is such a great reward then why get mad when your pal gets killed in the name of that cause... shouldn't you be happy? Oh well... never mind. Sort of like Christians being sad someone is going to heaven I suppose... anyone first thing; death is not an impediment, and revenge is part and parcel of the culture.  Stands to reason, then, that just killing this that and the other harmful may end up being just a zero-sum game. Like those squirrel-heads that pop up in the arcade and you have to hammer them down.  You kill a guy whose brother swears revenge and you kill him and his son swears revenge and the only real way you win is genocide but then that's all to your karma debts... the universe smites you for that one.  In any case all that does is make you the pariah of the world. It sounds really fine to talk about arcing things and nuking this and that but in the end that's a lot of childish dribble and even the guys saying it know that to be so. No American President will do it (though that won't stop them from saying anyone who doesn't believe in that is the nutcase... go figure!)  Won’t work / won't be the answer. Engage in it - and even if you're in the right - all you've done is embroil yourself right in that age-old culture just like we've all said a million times we should never do. And so there you are... slugging away like a lunatic (just like them) back and forth and kill me/kill you ad infinitum.  Well, that wouldn't be too brilliant.  Might make you feel good but in the long run all it comes down to is a commitment to fighting and the spending of treasure for an unaccountable period of time... and guess what? At some point, unless you show a success, or you are seen as working too much at killing thugs overseas and not enough as your jobs go down the drain you end up like President Bush I, as in OUT OF OFFICE, writing memoirs.  What good can you do then? Not too much, kiddies.  (Don’t worry, you can always blame the democratic press and say you were just misunderstood).  What else is true?  The ME has the oil - well yes largely true. Anyway that oil is right there with all those Muslim gentlemen, isn't it? Well... yes and no... Oil is in other places too! - What do you know!  What’s also true is there are these guys out there who gain political capital in their own lands by seeming to tweak the giant's nose. Funny how that works... even if he is one of our best friends, Egypt's Mubarak's popularity shoots WAY up every time he criticizes US policy.   Anyway what else is true?  Well one thing that's true is that the official US position on Palestine is that the Palestinians should have their own state, and that that state should co-exist with Israel. That’s not appeasement; btw, that's OFFICIAL US POLICY.  Yes Arafat blew that for his own twisted reasons; yes Hamas and those thugs want Israel's destruction. Yes and yes and yes. All true.  Now all we have to do is make sense of the jumble.  1. We need an Israel with the gloves off. I don't know if we actually have that much influence in Tel Aviv, but if we've given them advice about taking it easy on their enemies - we should shut up and back off. Israel should have the right of a sovereign nation to do whatever it needs to do to protect it and look after its interests. Nuff said.  2. Resume the policy to establishing a Palestinian state on a dual path with Israeli independence of action. Be the guy beating the drum for it. Say it all the time. Explain that its time. Enough killing and all that. Let’s get back to the table. Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Morocco (America's allies in the "Arab" world), front and center. Don’t stop saying it. Pound at it. Doesn’t matter if it ever happens... just be on the side of it, and make sure the "Arab street" knows what the policy is.  3. It isn't democracy, its free markets that will win the hearts and minds. In Afghanistan and Iraq - a sound monetary policy and a rising standard of living will do more to achieve the goals we seek than imposing a semi-democratic system that resembles a propped-up puppet. Here are two articles from the Cato Institute that give some specifics  urlLink Best Way to Grow Future Democracies    urlLink  Monetary Options for Post-War Iraq    4. open up exploration and drilling for oil in other parts of the world - well hell, guys, if you're all for knocking a few Muslim gentlemen around, why can't it be the environmentalists, whose blockage of exploration expansion plays directly into the hands of al qaeda? Hmmm?  5. Demonstrate the end-of-cycle for bin laden, his corporals and the al qaeda organization. Well? I keep having people tell me we should go after every last terror group in the world - so if we can do it to them all, why can't we do this? Doesn’t matter if it amounts to anything at this point, it will be a BIG WIN. And then we can get down to finding the root cause of terror.  6. (The non-intervention part) the self-determination of nations is the business of those nations. If they turn into the Khmer Rouge... what happens is they learn that is not ok. They don't forget the lesson. They evolve. They move on, and they did it themselves. If it happens the hard way, why is that my problem? I’m looking out for the US, not some noble altruism.  7. You want us out? Ok. It isn't punitive to walk away from a country that doesn't want us there; the only one it hurts is the guy in charge there who walked us out the door. A few years down the road people are going to say to him... "Why am I still using 8-tracks, you goof!" screw this! Build a policy wherein we're counting on human nature. It was human nature, more than any real policies, that brought down the Soviet Union.   8. Let people be their own bodyguard. If it is face-losing to leave Saudi Arabia, it isn't if it is part of a general closing of bases in other parts of the world. Germany, Japan... what exactly are we protecting them from? Also, the US Army exists to protect America and its interests. It doesn't exist to enforce the will of the United Nations. We want personal responsibility here, don't we? Why do we feel welfare works overseas then? That's what our bases are across the globe... the strong arm of the International Nanny State.  9. Do what we do best - out-economic them. We never thought it would happen, but God-bless President Reagan. He was the original architect of the demise of the USSR because he out-economic'd them. And in the end, it just fell apart. That’s the mindset we need here.  "When we were doing nothing but existing & carrying on with trade in general in the world" - last happened in the 19th century. It is mimicking an ostrich to say that's what we've been doing the last 100 years.   We need to change from the Internationalism of Wilson, Truman and Eisenhower, and move to the "Strategic Non-Interventionism" of  urlLink Robert A. Taft.

      That a regime with the potential of danger the Ba'athist version of Iraq presented has been demolished is a certain positive.  When all is said and done "human rights" have spiked upward in both Afghanistan and Iraq thanks to the removal of repressive governments in both cases. The violence we see there is not a matter of human rights, it is the result of (I believe as President Bush says) "a power grab."   I think anyone who doesn't see the recent fighting in Iraq as a power grab is not facing the reality that Hussein's removal - even now - created a vacuum. Those who think it is epidemic or a sign of a huge conflagration are just being hysterical.  And nothing of what I’m about to say in the rest of this post is being said as a reason to detach ourselves RIGHT THIS SECOND. the fact that we have 130,000 of our best in Iraq means - to me - that regardless of one's political view their sacrifices must never be seen to have been made in vain, and they deserve nothing short than to realize the full success of their mission.  However, a few of things don't sit right, and have never sat right with me.  One of the justifications for action in Iraq was based on the non-compliance of Iraq with UN resolutions set up to cease and ban the proliferation and construction of wmd's. The UN itself, when it mattered, shrunk from the duty it imposed on itself in the language of its own resolutions, which the US and a coalition (not the US unilaterally) proceeded to enforce, regardless.  When you take a step back and look at this what happened, in effect, was that the US and its allies acted upon the language of the UN's resolutions.   But even if Iraq was in violation of the resolutions, does the United States military exist to enforce the edicts of the UN? In effect, that is what we did.  And since that's the case, how can we seriously remove ourselves from that body when at the same time we use its conclusions to help justify our actions?  Secondly, weapons of mass destruction at the levels we were initially told about have not completely materialized. Though there is scattered evidence of sporadic material and residue, it should be fairly clear that the administrations heightened pro-conflict concerns seem overstated. And in any case, until a "smoking gun" that would show Iraq feeding such weaponry to Al Qaeda can be found, even if they eventually are found to posses these things Iraq did not have the long-range military capability - itself - to strike the United States.  The attack on Afghanistan directly effected a regime openly harboring members of Al Qaeda. Training camps and command structures were destroyed. A safe haven was taken away from them. Their power was scattered, and the regime Al Qaeda propped up was toppled.  But what evidence - hard evidence - did we have before we went in that the attack on Iraq would have a direct effect on the ranks of Al Qaeda or its structure?

      As Hitler discovered seventy years ago, the best way to advance one's agenda in a mass market is to spout the big lie. In the case of the Middle East, a virtual sea of lies from every entity involved if there ever was one, the apologists for terror often use the biggest lie;  'This is all about oil'.  Take for example the highly partisan rhetoric that often characterizes the post-Gulf War sanctions on Iraq as "genocidal". That kind of comment is very dishonest.  The supposition that the sanctions imposed on Irag after the 1991 Gulf War were "genocidal" sets the United States as the death-mongering evil power that was somehow responsible for ethnic cleansing there. We need to remind the interested observer that   1. genocide in Iraq was largely spelled S-a-d-d-a-m for decades (though somehow, suddenly, this has become a secondary consideration), and  2. the sanctions imposed on Iraq required conditions be met by the Iraqi government for their lifting - considerations the Hussein regime speciously agreed to but never carried out.  That President Bush's WMD pretext for war is shakey is without question, but the veracity of the argument against US policy is on the same, equally shakey, footing. Saying "it was blood for oil", has been largely refuted by neutral observers long ago in that    1. Iraq's oil is and was always legally purchased in exchange for dollars that instead of being a benefit to the "socialist ideal" of Iraq went to build palaces and create largesse for a few people at the top.  2. Iraq is and was only the 9th largest vendor of oil to the USA, and if the argument of "blood for oil" was in any way true we would be attacking Saskatchewan at this moment. and 3. The bulk of Iraqi oil goes to nations that did not participate in the action to force regime change.  Whether or not the motives of the Bush White House are altruistic or self-centered seems to be largely in the eye of which shill is speaking. The truth usually lies somewhere in the middle. No one is all bad, and no one is all good. That is usually the best place to start one's analysis.   But in any case what happens is that the claim that it was "all about oil" then usually coincides with apologetics for terror. And it is this aspect that makes that lie the worse of two evils.  The motivation of suicide bombers is most certainly not jealousy, as many observers once believed. The plain fact is that the motivation of suicide bombers is to strike a blow against a real,  perceived enemy and thus ensure their dream of going to an eternal reward. The motivation is based on a matter of faith that there is a "Paradise". So, in effect, whenever an apologist for Muslim-based terrorism speaks, what he is also doing is validating an unprovable religious fantasy. He therefore has more in common with all religious fundamentalists - in all cultures - than he may be ready to actually admit.  When terror's apologists get to saying that Hiroshima proves America is the true terrorist of the world (and so forth) the stumbling block becomes the fact that "America" can actually be named, pinpointed, located and subsequently identified. This isn't always the case with true terror organizations. When terror organizations operate without perceived connection to any actual state or identifiable or definable (and thus communicable) body, there is no opportunity for anyone to address concern, petition for redress, or negotiate with. In other words claiming responsibility for an act of terror does not in any way actually afix responsibility for one's actions, as where do the targets of their terror go to plead their case? Did, for example, the victims of 9/11 have an opportunity to first recognize that they may be in some danger and did they then have the opportunity to either make their case or be allowed to form their view and express their opinion on the issue about to change their lives forever? No, they did not - simply because they had no notion that they were at war, as did the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  The plain fact remains that terrorism has no end game except mayhem. There is no one to negotiate with, no one to express your opinion to, and no resolution possible other than either capitulation (which sets up an unlivable world) or death.  And, indeed, if one says the acts of terrorists are justified, (as in: "it is the only way left to them to fight") then labeling the targets as terrorists themselves is not an argument; it also says that  their  terrorism was justifed as well - since terrorism is now elevated to a viable arm of statecraft. You can't have it both ways.   Nations have the right to proceed with the protection of their interests. If we say that one nation (in this case America) doesn't have the right to pursue what it perceives as its interests - but all others have the right - we set up a double-standard. "Everyone can pursue their national interests but America" is not a fair application.  In summary, the fundamental flaws of being an apologist for terrorism is that the apologist sets up an impossible argument that cannot be approached by reason. There is no room for negotiation. The answer is always draconian. The result is simply killing and counter-killing with no end in sight, no endgame in mind other than annihilation.  The activity should be recognized as the irresponsibility that it truly is by all reasonable, fair-minded individuals; individuals who may have - in their own life and minds - already concluded that there needs to be a fairer application toward the Arab World, but went to work in the WTC one day and were killed anyway.

      I'm sorry you guys didn't figure it out first, and I'm sorry you didn't develop the technology of firepower too. I'm sure you would have put it to good use if you had. But this is the last time - and the only way - I'm going to apologize for where I live and how I got here.  I'm not sorry somebody took your lands, and I'm not sorry the same folks took half of Mexico after the Spanish took that part over from you. Just because they married you they think they own the place, but you know how sons-in-law are.  While I'm at it, I'm not sorry for the Norman invasion of Britain, or the Huns, or the migrants who came into America over the land-bridge and moved whoever was in the balcony back then into the cheap seats. I wasn't with Shaka when the Zulus subjugated most of South Africa, I had nothing to do with the Russian expansion eastward over a thousand years of history, or the Cro-Magnons  urlLink red-lining  northern Europe on the Neanderthals, for that matter.  So I'm not going to apologize for my ancestors coming across the ocean and kicking you into the cheap seats. Not that I think you  belong  in the cheap seats - I don't. But I'm not going to beat myself up about it either. I'm quite sure that if somebody came along and displaced my folks now, you wouldn't squawk.  No, the fact of the matter is that there's hardly a continent on Earth you could look at that hasn't at one time or another been the scene of migration and displacement. It is a dance everyone's "folks" have participated in at some point in history - one way or another.  Being without technology or living off the land doesn't automatically bring wisdom and it doesn't automatically equate to nobility.  Wisdom is wisdom and nobility is nobility. You can't say it exists just because you killed an animal to make a shirt - PETA wouldn't like it anyhow.  So get over it already.

      Mary in the office was thinking out loud the other day (always a dangerous thing) wondering, “whatever happened to those naked people in the mud at Woodstock… and the kids that were born there… and did that guy who was selling the brown acid ever get busted?”  Now – for the terminally young out there – we’re talking about Woodstock ‘69 – not ‘99.  But therein lies the tale… the answer to the “what happened” question in a nutshell.  The Woodstock generation touted peace and love and alternative problem solving. They were determined not to fall for the same values as their parents, so the mind-numbing overuse of drugs passed quite nicely for serenity and wisdom, and the kids were raised in the scent of raspberry candles and were to be the Progeny of the Vanguard of a New Age.  Somewhere along the way, though, the young dudes who carried the news (in their genes, I suppose?) didn’t exactly turn into the peace-loving cherubs of Aquarius. The Progeny of the Vanguard turned out to be largely violent, coarse-mouthed thugs used to getting their own way, and anything they ever wanted, because the Vanguard felt that “no” was the equivalent of a permanent psychic wound. Hence Woodstock ’99?  Anyway I imagine the natural decrepitude of age dealt with the random nakedness and even more random sex. That’s probably the easy part of the answer. I mean, after a while, who wants to anyway?  And what happened to the peace? That's easy too... Reality happened, that's what.  No - more disturbing to me than all that is the fact that when I was running from the police in Grant Park during the ’68 Democratic Convention (a 15-yr old kid just happening to be there while looking for some dope), even though I was young I knew all about the ideas;  to be naked in the mud at Woodstock would mean you believed in free speech, felt non-intervention was the wisest of foriegn policies forever, and in having as little interference in your life from the government as possible.   Seems to me most in the Vanguard found it easier to move to  “correct” speech, a foreign policy of automatic self-mutilating appeasement as the guiding principle behind throwing money at every other country in sight, and having as much government in your life as could be shoveled at you.   Just look around... The Vanguard isn't in the mud anymore. They put away their trinkets and beads, raised a bunch of loudmouth little monsters and morphed into lawyers and lobbyists.     So to answer Mary’s question… "whatever happened to all those naked people in the mud…?" What?... I'm still here!    Somebody hand me my pants...

      My wife’s grandfather was a rarity in Utah, especially rural Utah.  He was a devout Democrat.  I often wondered about this because he was actually fairly conservative in his views.  It was only later in his life I finally found out the real reason.  He and I had been talking about the Great Depression and the incidents which led up to World War II.  While discussing those tough times he brought up the Bonus Army camps in Washington D.C. and stated that he never forgave Hoover for ordering Macarthur and the Army to break up the camp and drive the WWI veterans out of the city.  In his words, “I will never vote Republican as long as I live.”  As far as I know he was true to his word.  This story, in a nutshell, illustrates what I believe to be the biggest problems facing American politics today; misplaced allegiances and tribalism.  Usually at a fairly early age, people align themselves with the political party with which they feel comfortable.  There is some give and take, but soon many people change their stance on some issues in order to come into line with their party, rationalizing the switch by convincing themselves that those issues were really not that important after all.  Before they know it, party loyalty takes precedence over everything else.  Republicans who would normally scream bloody murder about the deficits we are dealing with today find themselves excusing them simply because it’s their own party in office.  Democrats who condemned Nixon for the lies he told excused the same behavior when it came from the Clinton White House.  Republicans who are normally honest people find themselves excusing the lies and deception coming from our government, even though it has resulted in death.  When confronted, each side reacts in an identical manner.  They don’t demand higher standards from their own party; rather they justify their own party's actions by finding similar faults in the opposition, convincing themselves that this somehow makes it right.   We find this same tribalistic behavior in our religious institutions.  Many who were raised in a certain religion grow up believing that their church is in possession of the truth.  Many others come to that belief later in life, finding a specific religion the same way they found their political party.  And soon everyone believes that they have “the truth”, usually with a capital T.  Joseph Campbell warns  “If you fix on yourself and your tradition, believing you alone have got “It,” you’ve removed yourself from the rest of mankind.”   I’m not sure if things have always been this way, I suspect they have.  And I suspect that I’m noticing it more today because I am somewhat on the outside looking in.  Regardless, I don’t think one can argue with the fact that this behavior is worse today and that our country is more polarized than it has been for a very long time.  The question is, how did it get this way?  How can honest sincere people get to the point where they are forsaking ethics for party and/or religious loyalty?  I’m wondering if this is a symptom of western society and the thought processes we have been taught from birth.  In the west (Christianity, Judaism, and Islam) we often miss the metaphors and symbols in religion.  It seems we have a tendency to concretize symbols, preferring that which can be seen and felt.  Eastern societies and religions not only appreciate symbolism and metaphor, but they are the core of many of their most important teachings.  Buddhism, for example, teaches “if you see the Buddha coming towards you, kill him.”  In other words, if that which you worship has become so concretized that you can see it, you are in error.   Because our minds work in this manner, it’s that much easier for us to forget exactly what we should be worshipping and honoring.  Is it the flag we worship, or the ideals the flag represents?  Is it the crucifix we worship, or is it the sacrifice and love that crucifix has come to symbolize?  Is it the party to which we hold allegiance, or is it the principles for which that party stands?  And when the party has forsaken those principles in order to obtain or retain power, do we hold our own party accountable or do we forsake the principles in order to maintain allegiance to a mere symbol?  Maintaining allegiance to a party which no longer represents our ideals is just as foolish as my wife’s grandfather holding the Republican Party responsible for an error committed in 1932.  Joseph Campbell again, referring to the three western religions:  “They don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and to human beings rather than just to their own community.  It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world.  These three mythologies are fighting it out.  They have disqualified themselves for the future.”   Cannot the same be said for our main political parties?  And aren’t those who continue to maintain party loyalty at all costs merely enablers for those in power and who have long ago sold out?  Colin Powell faced this choice at the beginning of the Iraq War.  Did he make the right choice in placing his allegiance to his President?  Or should his allegiances have been to the principles the Office of the President is supposed to represent?

      We can begin this with the fact that there are different expectations in the benefits of religion in the East and the West, more specifically the Islamic and Christian cultures.   To the Islamic point of view there is a prevailing feeling about “Church and State” that has a different basis than we have in the West. The idea that the words and teachings of God would be excluded from the larger political foundation for the sake of secular convenience is beyond the comprehension of most people in that milieu. To be a Muslim is to literally “submit” to the will of a higher authority. It would be an embarrassment for many to be seen to be distilling what the Koran tells them should be so. In Islam, if the course is plotted by the teachings, it is the opposition to the teachings that is the evil and not whether the course is difficult or unpopular that matters. There is no secular argument that can overcome the command of a God. To believe there may be is foolishness. This is the ethos and motivation of the Islamic understanding. The conflict between “moderate” and “radical” nations in the Muslim World is one of the degree of sensibility to this ethic, and the degree of application relative to the outside world that is the issue of contention. The “radical” is such because his worldview is severe, absolute and unbending. That severity is based on a kind of rationality that says; “On the one hand the will of God, on the other the will of man.” For him, there is not only no argument, the idea of an argument existing is sin itself.   In the West, most notably the western democracies, religion resides in more of an advisory ethic than an absolute obligation. Religion is largely personal, and though the greater establishment of law can be seen to be intertwined with religious precepts, it is not absolute. Secular concerns that are not addressed, or addressed without exactitude in the dogma, are left to the evolutionary process of lawmaking.  And therein lies the fundamental failure of understanding between the cultures; the role of religion in each civilization’s method and organization.   I remember a Muslim friend of mine once commenting about pornography in America - he wondered how our religion could allow pornography to exist. I remember telling him it didn’t, it just wasn’t against the law in some cases. The look on his face in response to my explanation was a combination of confusion and a certainty I had not understood his comment.   From where he sat if it was against the religion it couldn’t possibly exist as lawful in the secular world. From where I sat it may be against the religion but not against the law. One of us came from a society where one dominant faith had been fused to the role of governance, and one of us came from a society where the law was guarded from too much interference from any specific faith whatsoever.  When religious leaders in the West call for more religion in the actions and ordinances of their government and that government’s decisions, are they taking a step toward the notion that “if it is against the religion it should not exist as lawful in the secular world” – like their Muslim counterpart?   And, if they are, what (besides the obvious view of suicidal martyrdom) is it that differentiates the point of view between a Muslim “radical” and a Christian “moralist?”

      For a long time now I've been just another hapless denizen of many an internet discussion board.   My experiences on these things have allowed me to find in my fellow citizens out there everything from the legitimate to the totally bogus, from the wonderfully under-rated to the completely fabricated, and from the gentle to the downright spooky. Sometimes the usual dose of oddball pathologies can drown out the shining stars. And I have to remind myself sometimes "people don't act like this in public."  And most people I have "met" on these things have all said - at one time or another - "people don't act like this in public." And this is true, but mostly because being faceless covers up a lot of shortcomings.  One of the reasons we chose a medium like this blog is to try and minimize the garbage that often comes along with electronic free speech. If possible.  The policy here is a simple one;  when interet "discussions" just roll on forever, the conversation invariably starts to become more about the writer than than the issue.   I think this is an axiom.  So we limit the responses from team members and let the comments of the visitor stand as they are - pretty much. At any case the visitors will always have the last word should they want it.   I am reminded of a scene from "West Wing" in which the President's chief political officer discovers there is a discussion board based solely on him. Despite the warnings of his #2, he begins to engage it by making posts. He is then exposed to the wonderous psychosis that is an internet discussion board. To which his #2 says to his face, "Poor Josh... he doesn't realize half these people have missed their meds today."  I don't think I've ever heard a more magnificent observation in my entire life.

      No not another French-bash... the fact of the matter is (he whispered) I'm really a Francophile from way back. That means I've always had a special feeling for France. A positive one. I have always harbored an affection for the French and all their "stuff." The favor has never been returned... I have  never  in my entire life been treated anything but shabbily by the handful of French people I've known - I have no idea why.  And yet... Outside of the developing American red Zinfandel, no other red but a French one is good enough for me. I've harbored a secret passion for Sophie Marceau since  before  Braveheart. Hugo's Hunchback of Notre Dame. Napolean. Charlemagne. The idea of a Foreign Legion, and the way they carried it off. I'm a Champagne snob. Fernand Braudel. I can lose myself in the history of the French Revolution. And then there was Abel Gance! The Impressionists. The place where Romanesque took flight. The exotic, seductive language...  And there it is.... The Language.   That's what this is all about - this thing between the US and France. It isn't the French belief in a need for a "multipolar" world where a HyperPower isn't allowed to run roughshod over an unsuspecting world. That is something Chirac invented out of a particularly self-serving wholecloth altruism (It is a little bit about the fall of the French Empire, and the fact that it never really achieved the stunning self-actualization and wealth of the British Empire). But it isn't even the embarrassment of a dizzying array of military debacles from the Second World War through Indo-China and Algeria and so forth and so on.   Its the language itself.  Though the French language has been side-by-side with English in the colonization and awakening of the world from the era of exploration to the establishment of colonial vassals in far-flung places around the globe, the post-colonial world has been demonstrating that English... more particularly American English... is the lingua franca of choice. And it galls them (Ok - sorry for the back-to-back puns).   Look at the Academy - that venerable Institution for the protecting and purity of Francais. For years it has been expunging the brazen influence of English on the speech of the commoners. This particular xenophobia is exactly the problem with French, but the Academy is loath to recognize it.  English adapts. It includes. It co-opts. Negotiates. If it likes what it sees in another language, it appropriates. French builds walls. Rejects influences. Stays rigid. Does not adapt. And in the process of protecting its purity it has stifled the one thing that keeps languages alive; Linguistic evolution.  This is what the conflict is really about. That tied into the inferiority complex of its own self-image in comparison to the American-English sphere of influence.   In an effort to maintain those things that make them unique, France is committing a form of suicide that is poorly disguised to look like the providing of an alternative power-center to the greater world.  That is the reason for their obstructionism toward the English-speaking world on the international stage. Being self-conscious of the fact that they ended up in 2nd place to English.  It is hard for them to admit. But the thing of it is... (third pun) if you're not used to making that particular sound from early on, you'll never really get it right.

      It didn't take long to start hearing people call for celebrations over the death of President Reagan, did it?  Have I stepped into a vaccuum or something? Do I not exist in the country I was born in anymore? I hardly recognize it.  You know what - I shouldn't be surprised, but I'm going to act surprised. Surprised and cranked and pissed off about it too - because people  aren't  being ticked off about these reactions is another problem.  When did politics in America become a slightly tamer version of Middle East Bloodsport? Should we be careful we don't have people mocking the ceremony when Reagan lies in state now? People outside banging drums and cheering that somebody is dead?   Last night I heard an exchange between two people who almost came to blows because one guy said he was so happy Reagan had died and the other guy said something like 'not as happy as I'll be when Clinton dies' and there they were... two idiots staring each other down over the actual or eventual death of Presidents.  PRESIDENTS.  What the hell is the matter with you people? Doesn't the office itself mean anything to anybody anymore? Is there no such thing as a "loyal opposition?" Oh wait... what am I thinking? I have the answer... no. And no. But it isn't because the politicians have ruined this that and the other. They certainly didn't help... but  in a democracy the people get the leadership they deserve.  No - the office means nothing anymore because people take their country, their constitution and their liberty for granted. The same voice that can muster the partisan lunacy to say "Ronald Reagan was no better than Hitler" is the same guy who would gladly reduce your constitutional rights by slow erosion and call it "good for you" himself.  I'm becoming convinced the politicians haven't done anything quite as effective to bring about this ridiculous and callous disregard for the national life, or the agitated and shameful partisan intemperance as "we the people" have.   We're the real villians in the piece because we put everything into disproportionate categories that are relative to little and signify even less.  Not to mention the bulk of us don't have any class at all.

      The day I entered college in 1981 declaring myself a Computer Science major, just over 200 others at that university were doing the same. On graduation night six years later, I was one of only six Computer Science graduates. The future looked very bright. There were far more jobs in the computer related fields than there were candidates to fill them; and the barrier to entry into that field (a Computer Science degree) was sufficiently high that few who attempted to get in actually did. I thought I was looking at a long career highway paved with silver; good pay and plentiful jobs.   Well, that's how it went until the development of world wide high speed broadband (something I helped develop). Today the prospects require American high tech workers to make a choice; hold on and just hope your job isn't exported, go to work in an auto parts store, grocery store, car wash, etc..., retrain for something else, or move to India. The advent of the internet and the technology that enables high speed broadband (particularly fiber and satellite) is facilitating the export of not only my job (embedded software engineer), but my whole industry off shore.   In 1995, the technology infrastructure didn't exist that would allow a man to sit in a lab in Bopal, Mumbai or Calcutta and work on a computer in Dallas, San Jose or Minneapolis. By 1999, that infrastructure was largely in place - and American business wasted no time in putting it to use. By the end of 1999, a full 30% of Microsoft's software staff was in India. IBM, who three years prior had laid off 40,000 people in one day, began moving operations to India at a break-neck pace.   Today, if you call your utility, insurance company or bank about a problem or for a question, odds are that one in three of those calls will be fielded by someone in India. Nearly everyone in the upper castes of India's caste system can speak English. Those working in call centers are trained to speak with an American accent. So most of the time, we don't even know were talking to someone off shore. If your doctor prescribes an MRI, mylogram or X-Ray; the odds are that a doctor in India will be the one that interprets the image and writes the report that your doctor conveys to you. When the teller at the bank pulls up your statement in real time, odds are that the information was retrieved from a data center in India.   There is no end in sight to our exportation of jobs off shore. Between salary, taxes and benefits, it costs my employer 10 times more to employ me in the U.S. that it would to employ a man in India. Because technology has made this type of ultra-cheap labor possible, American business can reduce it's opex (operating expenses) by a far greater magnitude by exporting my job than they did by exporting manufacturing jobs back in the 70's. In the late 90's, the software engineering industry had an unemployment rate of 0%. Today it stands at 12%. Ironically, many Indians and Chinese high tech workers that were here on H1B visas, have gone back to their native countries because they can find work there and not here.   The export of high tech jobs is, I believe, just the beginning. We will see not only the electrical and software engineering industries exported in the fashion that manufacturing was 25 years ago, but we'll see other industries exported as well; banking, law, architecture, accounting, help desks, and the list goes on and on and on and on. Even the Republican party is exporting jobs!  urlLink Check out this link.     The key is to either put myself into a niche of my field that won't be exported (possibly defense) or to retrain for a field that can't be exported. As I know a number of experienced and competent engineers who have been unemployed for two and a half years, I've decided not to stay in this field and just "hope" for the best.   At 41, it feels very ... wierd sitting in a chemistry and/or biology class with a bunch of 18 and 20 year old kids at a local college. At this time in my life, I had figured on sending my oldest boy to college, not myself. If all goes according to plan, in two years of night classes I'll have completed all the Chemistry and Biology that are prerequisite to be accepted into one of the three local Physician's Assitants programs in the Dallas area. Assuming I am accepted into one of those programs (there's no guarantee - only 1 in 15 applicants are accepted), I'll have to quit my software engineering job (assuming I still have it) to spend the next three years in one of those full time programs.  Anyone out there in the same boat?

      This morning a customer drives in to pick up his millwork and while he's sitting in the office waiting to get loaded he begins - without prompting - to pontificate about the great chance the Democrats have of ousting President Bush because his lies have been exposed by the 9/11 Commission. "He's been saying Saddam was in on 9-11 and now we know it was a lie."  No worries. Business etiquette precludes me from upbraiding a paying customer for being a stiff, and I pick up the phone to drum up some more business while he drones on and on... but all the time I'm thinking  President Bush said last September Saddam had nothing to do with 9/11...   urlLink (reference)   I let it slide. He's an old guy... probably a lifelone democrat. No worries.  A little later in the day one of our own is sitting in the conference room thumbing through the newspaper and shaking his head. "I could never vote for a democrat, all they do is throw our money down a deep dark hole. Bush won't let them do that."  No worries. Business etiquette once again precludes me from saying anything... this time for purposes of the TEAM and the fact that politics is a bad thing to be talking about on staff.. especially with all the work we're buried with in this economic downturn. I've got enough to take care of so I just grab my 7-Up out of the refrigerator and head back out to the office and all the time I'm thinking  President Bush has out-popped LBJ's "Great Society" by leaps and bounds... we're building Republican sponsored bridges from island to island in Alaska to connect 68 people...   urlLink (reference)   I let it slide. He's a brand-new Republican and never heard of Robert Taft or Barry Goldwater. No worries.  Then the Mexican kid from shipping comes in to turn in the papers from all the trucks that have left and hears the news on the radio about the car bomb in Iraq, and immediately goes into his Che Gueverra / Sandanista routine about how the American army is "oh... yes... yes... they are only there to HELP... uh-huh... sure!" And then mumbles something about "Oil - first last and always" under his breath as he walks back out the door.  No worries. A pretty brassy act for somebody who is probably illegal and i'm fairly certain has three names... and I just shake my head and go back to the open order book and all the time I'm thinking  If we were taking over Iraq strictly on the basis of oil what the heck am I paying $2.00 a gallon for now that we control it all...? And if we really wanted to do that why the heck don't we invade Canada and Mexico who supply us with MOST of our crude?   urlLink (reference)   I let it slide. He's a ditzy kid... tells me he is against capitalism but works two jobs so he can buy a big house in Mexico and go back there stinking rich in a few years. Young people are supposed to be liberal shills. No worries.  I'm starting to notice I let a lot of things slide. I'm also starting to feel like someone who is trying to hold back a tidal wave with a bedsheet. It has been this way for quite some time.   Should I be worried....?

      Browsing the internet posting boards last weekend made me think about the respect, or lack thereof, we give our political opponents.  It didn’t take a google expert to find a number of posts where the writer expressed his glee at the death of President Regan.  I hope I never get to the point where I celebrate the death of a political opponent.  A mortal enemy is one thing, but rejoicing in the death of someone because I disagreed with their fiscal policy?  Nope.  This subject has already been discussed and I’m not going to tackle it again, but it made me think about exactly which people or offices demand and deserve our respect for no other reason other than that they simply exist.    To be honest, I can’t think of many.  Should we respect the office of the Presidency simply because of what it is, or does our respect need to be earned?  I just finished “Plan of Attack” by Bob Woodward.  Before I read this book I viewed President Bush as a manipulator.  I viewed him as a politician who would say whatever needed to be said in order to push through his agenda, and I viewed him as someone who purposely mislead the American people in order to win public support for the invasion of Iraq.  Reading the book changed my mind somewhat.  After reading the book I viewed President Bush as a politician who had surrounded himself by people who not only lied to the American people, but they lied to their President as well.  After reading the book I viewed President Bush as a man who meant well and truly believed he was doing the right thing.  In short, he is someone who did the wrong thing for the right reasons.  The more I think about this, the more I wonder.  Take the news from the last two days as an example.  Yesterday Vice-President Cheney gave a speech once again claiming that there were long-established ties between the Al Qaida and Iraq.  He offered no evidence other than his word.  Today the 9/11 Commission refuted those claims (not the first time, I might add) and stated that not only did no connections exist, but also that Iraq even rebuffed attempts from Bin Laden to establish ties.    Now here’s the big deal: not one word from President Bush.  He and V.P. Cheney have access to the same material from which the 9/11 commission reached this conclusion, yet they continue to make these claims or stand silently by while others make them.  These are the same claims used to enlist support from the well-meaning average citizen for the Iraq War, which has resulted in the deaths of over 10,000 people.  Over 10,000 deaths, and our President feels no reason to admit mistakes about weapons of mass destruction and links to Al Qaida.  Worse than that, he has even joked about not finding the weapons of mass destruction.  So I ask the question again, should we respect the office of the Presidency simply because of what it is?    I don’t think so.  In order for a person to have my respect, they better have a moral compass, and this President shows all the signs of having lost his.  A moral compass doesn’t prevent people from making bad decisions and doing the wrong thing for the right reasons.  However, it should prevent you from allowing the same lies to be told which got you lost in the first place, it should help you in correcting your actions when it has become obvious you were wrong, and it should prevent you from joking about topics such as weapons of mass destruction.  Again, searching for WMD’s and invading Iraq has cost over 10,000 lives.  Now, isn’t someone who would joke about a topic such as WMD’s the same type of person who would joke and rejoice at the death of an ex-President?

      No one in their right mind can deny the history of racism in America. If people think that there has been no discrimination, no lynchings, no Jim Crow, no real estate red-lining, they haven't been paying attention.   But why is it after 40+ years, millions of dollars in welfare and programs, and countless pieces of particular legislation later we are still no better off in our race relations than we were in 1964?  I mean... that is  true  isn't it? At least, when I read Derrick Z. Jackson that's the impression I get.   If these programs to institutionalize racial harmony have achieved nothing in all this time why do we keep doing them?  Case in point the latest screed from Mr Jackson of the Boston Globe  urlLink in reference to the death of Ronald Reagan.   There's nothing in this latest that we haven't heard before. Ronald Reagan was bad because he didn't support all the programs meant to assure racial harmony (that haven't worked).  Ronald Reagan was bad because he believed in states' rights (which would assure these programs that haven't worked would disappear). Ronald Reagan was bad because he believed in personal responsibility. Ronald Reagan was bad because John Wayne openly questioned the veracity of black leadership in America in a Playboy magazine once. And so on.   The fact of the matter, I think, is that Ronald Reagan was bad because what he really wanted was to get black Americans off the Democrat plantation. That's what really scares Mr Jackson. He'd hate to have to give up his chair to people like La Shawn Barber, Thomas Sowell, Condoleeza Rice, Geoffrey Moore, Walter Williiams, or a host of  urlLink other independent-minded black thinkers who don't need Mr Jackson's race-baiting mantra to actually form a thought.    I know I know... it isn't PC to be white and speak about black people. Not allowed. Automatically not qualified. I know all about it.  But I also know enough to know that there is nothing inherently inferior about black people. I know that they are as capable of wisdom and leadership as any white person who ever lived. I know that they are just as capable, just as human, just as able to do and build and write and think and be as any other human being. And that they are largely pinned by their "leadership" to a mindset that makes them a permanent underclass - not to feed whitey - but to feed a self-perpetuating black leadership that otherwise couldn't exist without them being stuck in their poverty and despair. Automatic ammunition for the class war that never seems to get better.  If the white man stops being the excuse, it isn't that black people would have to do something - they already work themselves dead to make it in the world - its their  leadership  that would actually have to make a legitimate contribution to society for a change, instead of going on with their usual race-baiting and cop-out-enabling shuck and jive like poor, impoverished, and oppressed Derrick Z Jackson.

      A great many articles are being put forward denying that Politically Correct speech is even a problem at this juncture. An old issue, they will tell you. Just doesn't happen any more, they will say.   I contend that it isn't that the issue is dead at all, but that we don't notice it any longer. Part of the culture now, it slinks in under the radar.  That agendas can be put forward by language, and what language is disallowed, should be obvious by now. Or is it obvious, really?  Here is a short list of words and images, according to Diane Ravitch, that editors and writers of school textbooks  are required  to avoid.  "snowman" -  BANNED  replaced by "snowperson." "senior citizen" -  BANNED  marginalizes older people. "jungle" -  BANNED  replaced with "rain forest." "blind leading the blind" -  BANNED  as "handicapism." "polo" -  BANNED  as elitist. "senile" -  BANNED  as demeaning. "Founding Fathers" -  BANNED  sexist. "fairy" -  BANNED  replaced with elf.  You can't depict men as "active problem solvers" or working with tools. You can't have a pioneer woman riding in a wagon if the man is walking, and don't put twinkles in older people's eyes.    But don't take my word for it... you could look it up...

      I have been suffering for about 12 years now with a rare, progressive disease. As far as anyone can tell NENLI is not hereditary. In fact there are varying ideas about its causes, but no one has ever put forward the definitive pathology.  It isn't debilitating so much as it is a nuisance, but over the years there is a discernible, gradual increase in the severity of the symptoms. Its final manifestations can lead to a complete disorientation, but - so far as is known - it is not directly fatal.  The most notable symptoms are sporadic but intense visual fixations (staring), and a transformation of sensory perception to such a degree that the sufferer becomes insensitive to normal stimuli such as pain, heat and (in the most severe cases) sometimes the body cannot recognize that it is hungry, for example.  To some degree every one of us has some aspect of the condition, and there is a wide variance of its effects, but in its most severe form it achieves the designation as being NENLI.  My case isn't as bad as some I've seen. I haven't become so disoriented that I have no contact with reality at all - like some I've seen. But I have to admit that more and more the condition is gaining in its centrality in my life. And there doesn't seem to be much I can do about it. Nor - sometimes - do I really want to.  After all, NENLI (also known as Nostalgia for an Era Never Lived In) has its positives too.  My particular case of NENLI is directly brought on by exposure to photography and film image. I have, for example, a book that contains (among other things) photographs of ballparks that no longer exist. Looking at images of Griffith Stadium in Washington DC, the Polo Grounds in New York, West Side Park (where Tinkers to Evers to Chance played for the Cubs before Wrigley Field ever existed) in Chicago, will jump-start the symptoms described above without fail. I will stare at the photos, not hear the radio any longer, and become oblivious to the passage of time.  The same effects can be obtained by watching silent films and, if the sufferer isn't careful, a person can - over time - be conversant with the details of an entire milieu that no longer exists: Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, Lillian Gish, and Lon Chaney.  What is most debilitating about this is that there are - as time progresses - fewer and fewer people to converse with about these things, until one finds himself in an ocean of blank expressions and non-responses when you try to explain your impressions of what you are seeing. There is not a lot of affinity granted to people who suffer from the disease from those who do not understand it.  Worse still are the catatonic moments that an incidental brush with a photograph can cause. The sufferer becomes transfixed with a scene from the street photographed in 1887. The clothes. The expressions. The wondering what the temperature was just at that moment. The voices.....  And, finally, the secret places one goes to fulfill the overwhelming craving for more of it.   Always more.  It will probably eventually require an intervention of some sort. But in the meantime I can claim that even my government is feeding this disease. Just a few minutes  urlLink here  would be enough to see what I mean.  My better sense tells me that life before 1920 wasn't close to the sense we have of a glorious and gilded age. Medical care was shoddy and undeveloped. Lynching was in its epidemic era. Child Labor formed a certainly legitimate complaint from the working people of the time. My common sense tells me this is so. But my disease often blocks out common sense.  Or didn't I explain that part.....

      The Chicago Tribune movie critic Michael Wilmington gave a 4-star rating to Fahrenheit 9/11 this morning.   Not having seen the movie this is a review of the review – such as it is. And by the review, because for some reason Wilmington actually praises both points for being used, I get the impression that the movie is generally yet another “have it both ways” attacks. You know the one I mean; Where one minute President Bush is a man of limited intelligence who is pushed around by events to such a degree he can’t manage a coherent thought let alone express one, and the next minute his family ties to oil and the Saudi royal family combined with shady manipulation of information make him the malevolent opportunist mastermind of the world.  One minute he’s an idiot. The next minute he’s an evil and brilliant hegemon.  If that’s the case the film puts forward – if I am reading Wilmington right – there isn’t much new around this event, then. The democrat partisans have been teasing the republican partisans with this double-edged (and plastic) sword since Florida. What’s the big deal?  No, the thing that bothered me most from the review was the depiction of the scene where Moore does his “gotcha” interview routine on some democratic Congressman who voted “for” the war. One wonders why he didn’t ambush Senator Kerry with the same question – but I digress.  The thought of Moore bounding out of the shrubbery is creepy enough, but the photograph provided shows this particular Congressman being just as portly as Moore, and so there they stand – navel to navel – as Moore askes him; since he voted for the war when is he sending his son to go fight…?  Well the Congressman’s deer-in-the-headlights expression notwithstanding, Moore’s leading question would have been more relevant and more associated with reality if we were under a national draft. But with a volunteer army – what’s the point of the question?  Are we supposed to assume the people who join the military are doing so under the impression that there may not come a time when they could be asked to actually go into combat? Is it possible Moore thinks this was never explained to any new recruits?  The “lower classes fighting your war” argument carried weight in Viet Nam… but that was because the kids of film-makers and such had college deferments and grew up to become sycophantic liberals while the kids who didn’t have that option went into the draft.  That was reality in the Viet Nam era – not Iraq. Moore’s question is a grand-standing trap. And it is also irrelevant.    And so what is the net effect of Fahrenheit 9/11? Seems easy to see. The democrats will cheer a rehash of the same old specious arguments they’ve had all along, and the republicans will dismiss it as more anti-American liberal twisting and propaganda. Which means nothing changes.  Meantime what the film is really about – money – will finally be flowing to Moore after a long and not-so-lucrative career till now. And the political discourse in this country will remain as bitter and peevish as it has always been.  So we’re right back where we started.

      A good argument can be made that Iraq was the wrong war. Another good argument can be made that in the long run this mess will be all for the better, being post-Saddam. If nothing else it has not had the same effect on the real enemy - al Qaeda - as the action in Afghanistan (with the world behind us) had. As in all cases like it this is now the season for the second-guessing and the third-quip. The dance of the revisionists from all sides of the issue has already begun, each worldview vying to place its interpretation into the winner's history book.  In the meantime we have well over 100,000 of our kids in harm's way and we are pouring more treasure and attention into the infrastructure of Iraq than we originally figured.  June 30 looms ahead of us. The transfer of power... such as it will be.   We've been down this road before. We tried it in Mexico, the Philippines, Haiti, The Dominican Republic, Viet Nam, Lebanon... and the heavies of the current Bush Administration themselves (pre-9/11) were on record as being opposed to "nation-building."  As the caption by a picture in this month's  urlLink Foreign Policy  article "Imperial Amnesia" by John Judis reads as American soldiers frisk hapless citizens in different centuries... "You have the right to remain liberated."  The fact of the matter remains that without a Monarch, consistent "nation-building" can't exist. We have the potential to change entire administrations every four years. We have a historically short attention span for that reason - and for other, more cultural ones. "Nation-building" requires a constant attention, whereby things are moved along in an understandable pattern over the long-haul.  The bugaboo is that what we never seem to learn is that liberators turn into occupiers at the first twinge of nationalism in the hearts of the occupied. We barely impinged democratic ideals in the above mentioned litany of nations we "built."   So short and sweet - We need 1. To quit sniping at one another about how we got ourselves into this.  2. Recognize the historical record of these kinds of efforts.  3. Understand our cultural and logistical limitations relative to  where  it is we have physically located ourselves. 4. Accept the fact that Iraq will eventually determine its own configuration at one time or another in the future no matter what. And 5.  The longer we stay the more whatever government gets put into place there will look like a puppet / and the more it looks like a puppet the less chance there is of its success.   One note rarely thought of; it is important that our kids serving in Iraq do not depart with the idea that this mission was a failure. So a 6th rule would be...  6. Make realistic expectations, meet them, and get out.  Even the National Review wrote of this last back in April in a piece titled  urlLink  An End to Illusion  / We should downplay expectations.   Our duty in the world is neither to be the enforcer of United Nations resolutions, or the builders of the Holy Kingdom on Earth.  That's what other folks are trying to do... and we all know what  they  look like to us...

        Yesterday our payment processor PayPal - after almost a year of doing business with  urlLink AMEA  - decided to close our account because we seem to be in violation of their  urlLink Mature Audiences Policy . Hopefully they will return our funds.   Since 1996 we have been working with US companies, so we are no longer amazed with their strategies. We have seen everything from mindless decisions to plain wire fraud. On one occasion we asked an employee of such a company why there was so much corruption in his firm.   The simple but astonishing reply was: "But we are the Empire!"   Well, living in "the old country" we have seen Empires come and go and it would be our advice to our friends abroad to stop making too many enemies outside their borders because that happens to be the common downfall of all Empires...  This is happening to adult companies all over the net, no matter where they are based.  PayPal and EBay are getting absolutely hypocritical and paranoid*, due to what, I'm not sure.  Could be just how their owners feel.  Could be they see Big Brother breathing down their necks due to the Patriot Act.  Heaven only knows.    * Savvy sellers on EBay all know there is a  urlLink Mature Audiences   section on the site where (nearly) anything goes.  However, quite often adult-oriented auctions go on in non-Adult categories, concluding - and slipping past the monitors - with no comment.

       The testosterone factor is a bit thick around here, so I'm changing the subject a wee bit, boys...  I became part of the  urlLink Century Project  recently.  Early one morning, I met photographer Frank Cordell and had the privilege of reviewing his entire portfolio for this, his "...life's work," as he calls it.  Amazing women looked back at me, each with amazing stories of survival, experience, pain, sorrow, and joy.  Real women with stories to tell, new women just starting their journey in life, old women about to pass on to the next.  I was referred to this project by a link brought to my attention.  I visited Frank's website, emailed him my compliments and volunteered to be a subject.  The next day, he called from California amazed at the serendipity of it all, explaining he was coming through  urlLink my town  on his way east to New Hampshire, having several appointments along the way east of here for photo shoots.  Could we get together and talk, and see what happens?  I said I'd love to.    So the morning we met, we mutually decided it would work for both of us, found an outdoor venue, and got to work.  The site was by the river, where there is a well-used path.  As we wrapped up the session, moments later a family walked by.  Close call...!

      In 1997, the Heartland Institute published a  urlLink broadside  in  Environmental News  that began to focus on the  political  as well as the scientific aspects of the discussions surrounding the theory of global warming that had been gaining ground in the national consciousness. In the article they interviewed some researchers whose models seemed to funk out from time to time...   "On the whole, climate modelers are a decidedly more modest lot than they were just a few years ago. Having seen their models' predictions of rising temperatures not confirmed by actual readings, they are beginning to appreciate how such variables as aerosols and cloud cover can bedevil the most sophisticated computers. Kerr spoke with one senior climate modeler who preferred his name not be used. Summarizing the doubts many climate modelers are beginning to voice, the humbled scientist said, "The more you learn, the more you understand that you don't understand very much"."    What we seem to have all forgotten is that in the 70's the same science was pointing to a new Ice Age, rather than a new Tropical Age. The  urlLink Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise  reminds us  "In fact, 30 years ago forecasts for global cooling represented the conventional wisdom. For example, a feature story in the April 28, 1975, edition of Newsweek described "ominous signs" that the climate had started "to change dramatically."    Well... what do you know, that isn't just an urban legend... here's an excerpt from the Newsweek issue from that date courtesy of the  urlLink University of Texas at Austin .   "The evidence in support of these predictions has now begun to accumulate so massively that meteorologists are hard-pressed to keep up with it. In England, farmers have seen their growing season decline by about two weeks since 1950, with a resultant overall loss in grain production estimated at up to 100,000 tons annually.... To scientists, these seemingly disparate incidents represent the advance signs of fundamental changes in the world's weather. Meteorologists... are almost unanimous in the view that the trend will reduce agricultural productivity for the rest of the century. If the climatic change is as profound as some of the pessimists fear, the resulting famines could be catastrophic. "A major climatic change would force economic and social adjustments on a worldwide scale," warns a recent report by the National Academy of Sciences... A survey completed last year by Dr. Murray Mitchell of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reveals  a drop of half a degree in average ground temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere between 1945 and 1968.  According to George Kukla of Columbia University, satellite photos indicated a sudden, large increase in Northern Hemisphere snow cover in the winter of 1971-72.  And a study released last month by two NOAA scientists notes that the amount of sunshine reaching the ground in the continental U.S. diminished by 1.3% between 1964 and 1972."   "Climatologists are pessimistic that political leaders will take any positive action to compensate for the climatic change, or even to allay its effects. They concede that some of the more spectacular solutions proposed, such as melting the Arctic ice cap by covering it with black soot or diverting arctic rivers, might create problems far greater than those they solve. But the scientists see few signs that government leaders anywhere are even prepared to take the simple measures of stockpiling food or of introducing the variables of climatic uncertainty into economic projections of future food supplies.  The longer the planners delay, the more difficult will they find it to cope with climatic change once the results become grim reality."    Good heavens! Are we dead yet?  In 2001 Dr. Patrick J. Michaels (author of  Satanic Gases: Clearing the Air About Global Warming ) penned an article for a publication called  urlLink Objective Science  that directly challenged the  science  used to come to the conclusions we were about to be turned into rye toast in which he questioned the models used from a scientists viewpoint...  "It's not that there weren't other computer models available. There are. There were nearly 20 different sophisticated, but still flawed, models tested in the IPCC's TAR called general circulation climate models (GCMs). If Watson were forthcoming, he would have pointed out that the average for those models was a rise of only about 3.8°F--or some 2.75 times less than the extreme value Watson and the Post trumpet."   An organization in Britain known as Numberwatch published its   urlLink Ten Facts About Global Warming   everyone should know. Its funny stuff... in a way.  This would be funnier if it wasn't so see-through. Global Warming indeed... if by GLOBAL one means  G rants  L eaving  O ur  B ig  A mbiguous  L ab!   In the winter it gets cold. In the summer it gets hot. Sometimes it rains. Sometimes its dry. If you stay out in the sun too long you may burn.   Oh yeah... and don't forget to eat plenty of complex carbohydrates.   Oh...   wait a minute... --------------------  Further Reading:  Global Warming and Other Eco Myths: How the Environmental Movement Uses False Science to Scare Us to Death

      I'm putting this up for the benefit of any who may be coming by over the next few days after getting an email invite from me to pay us a visit. I should note that rather than spamming a long list, I sought out individual people after looking at their work - or already knowing their work - and asked them to take a look.  Don't laugh... I even emailed Walter Cronkite. Swear to God.  My friends and I are looking to create a kind of safe-haven for ideas and counterpoint. I have been on many of these kinds of venues and watched them deteriorate into name-calling miasmas of nonsense, and quite frankly that's enough of that. Political discourse in this country has hit an all time low and it doesn't take too long to find Jerry Springer's influence in what was once the orderly art of debate.  I have sought out people who would bring in a WIDE range of outlooks and experiences and opinions. We will bring conservative and liberal thinkers in one place, state our cases, and move on. Ideas are not measured by a point system here. They stand on their own in the hopes the casual observer will find it can inform their opinion.  If there is such a thing as an across-the-spectrum think tank, this is it.  We want creative people. People who are not afraid to disagree, but can do so out of intelligence rather than ego. I have purposely tried to find people I already know I disagree with to join us.  If you can contribute as a passer-by, making the occaisional posting - we'd love that. If you want to originate articles (which remain your intellectual property) contact us.  There is validity in honestly-arrived-at opinions no matter to what scope they vary from one another.   Lets prove it.

      Without understanding the thinking of the Old Right, modern day Conservatives miss a vital part of the building blocks that construct the fundamental basics of conservative philosophy. In my view, to the degree we forget people like Robert A. Taft and the principles he espoused, is proportional to the degree America has started its way down the path to becoming a "One Party State."    These wider nuances of American conservatism deserve to be aired and reviewed by those people who now claim title to that ground in our political life today.   The events of 9/11 and the subsequent success in Afghanistan appear to have turned President Bush permanently away from what appeared to be a rebirth of Strategic Non-Interventionism hinted at in the begining of his administration. We now have a full-bore Internationalist in the White House similar to presidents of the Cold War at its apex.   But how many of us even remember when the Republican road contained an alternate route?   Here is a story from the Independent Institute on  urlLink  The Republican Road Not Taken , that we should remember and reflect on.  Excerpts:   "Republican congressional leader Robert A. Taft articulated a non-interventionist foreign-policy vision sharply at odds with the internationalism of Truman and Eisenhower. Although derided as ostrich-like, Taft was prescient on several points, such as the structural weakness of the United Nations and the propping up of repressive regimes that would result from U.S. interventionism." ....... "Although Taft voted for membership in the United Nations, he eventually came to believe that the United States should “develop our own military policy and our own policy of alliances, without substantial regard to the non-existent power of the United Nations to prevent aggression”   Taft himself:  "There are a good many Americans who talk about an American century in which America will dominate the world.... The trouble with those who advocate this policy is that they really do not confine themselves to moral leadership. They are inspired with the same kind of New Deal planned-control ideas abroad as recent Administrations have desired to enforce at home. In their hearts they want to force on these foreign peoples through the use of American money and even, perhaps, American arms the policies which moral leadership is able to advance only through the sound strength of its principles and the force of its persuasion."   A Republican against U.S. guns and money boring down influence into the darker regions of the world would seem to be completely foreign to any liberal critic in the ranks of the Democratic party these days, wouldn't it? Yet strains of this sentiment do exist in conservative circles - though muted by a wounded patriotism after 9/11.  His ideas were pretty much cast aside as "Isolationism," which was the pejorative term used by his opponents to neutralize his campaigns those times he sought the Republican nomination for President.   It was a mis-representation.  ----------------- Recommended reading:  The Papers of Robert A. Taft   Biography of Robert A. Taft

      One of the most absurd arguments one finds on any given discussion board is whether the press favors the left or the right.  Neither side will admit that it’s the stories which piss us off that we remember, so each side ends up pointing the finger at the press for favoring the opposition.  What a crock.  The bottom line is that the press favors neither.  They kiss the ass of whoever they have to in order to get the front row seat for the story.  It’s not the truth which matters, and rarely is it the importance of the story.    Reporters are first and foremost concerned that they don’t rock the boat and ask too many difficult questions of our politicians.  They know if they do, they may not be invited to the next press conference.  This practice has led to an unhealthy symbiotic relationship between our politicians and the press.  They lob softballs to President Bush and he’ll make sure to call on them again.  This makes them and their network look like they are on the leading edge, when in reality they are nothing more than doing their duty as a member of the old boys club.  The days of good investigative journalism are gone.  In fact, the more I think about it, the more I wonder if they ever existed.  Where was the press during the Tonkin Gulf resolution?  Where were they during the energy crisis in California?  Where were they when the Patriot Act was being rushed through congress?  Where were they when Tenet told Bush the case against Iraq and WMD’s was a slam dunk, yet offered no “slam dunk” evidence?  Sure they are talking about them now, but they have been the followers, not the leaders.  They followed the pack and rarely criticized this administration early on.  Most of the critical stories being brought to us today are done so in spite of the press, not because of them.      Say what you will about the press in Europe, but it seems to me that they understand that our politicians work for us and are to be held accountable for their actions.  The press in America treats the president and many politicians the same way the Queen is treated in England.  You will rarely see softballs being lobbed at Tony Blair.  And that is the way it should be.  Of course if it were up to me, I’d also give the Queen one that was high and inside.  Case in point, when President Bush was in Ireland recently he was interviewed by Carole Coleman.  It was obvious that Bush was caught completely off guard by her questioning, so much so that the White House lodged a formal complaint and cancelled an interview that the first lady had scheduled with the press at a later time.  Hey, who works for who here?  Since when should the American People think it’s okay for the White House to lodge a formal complaint because they don’t like the questions being asked?    urlLink Reference   I’ve mentioned this before in a different post here, but I think it stinks that we need to rely on the likes of Michael Moore to show us footage which has existed for years.  This man is not a journalist, he’s a filmmaker.  If some of his footage is so damning and controversial, why hadn’t the American Press showed us these clips long ago?  We need to find a way to enjoy the benefits of a free press but not have the job they do so thoroughly tied to the advertising dollar.  As long as the current relationship between the press, politicians, and business exists, the only role we can be guaranteed the press will play will be the one of an obedient lap dog.

      My Dad was in World War II.  He passed away in August 2001, and before and after, I pondered that defining time in his life.  I pondered it after 9/11, when people suddenly became super patriots, flags everywhere, spouting off about subjects they knew next to nothing about, emotions overtaking what sense they may or may not have had in the first place.  I read an  urlLink excerpt  from a book that sounds like it asks some good questions, and has some interesting things to say, called   urlLink Homeland  .  In it, it questions why people react the way they do to defining events.  I love and appreciate America, but I also feel many actions we do can and has been wrong.  We that live here should always question what's going on.  If that makes me a troublemaker, then so be it.  My Dad loved America too, laying his life on the line many times during WWII.  He came back quietly as most men did, no parades, no fanfare.  He didn't fly a flag either, but neither did he get angry over it.  He just went on with life.  But one thing he always taught me not by empty words but by his example, is that you do what you can, you work hard, and you DO ask questions.

      My son-in-law  urlLink Meran  is a  urlLink translator/interpreter  for the Titan Corporation, which is  urlLink under investigation * for various charges by our government, who contracted with them in the first place.  For me, it is fascinating on two levels.  First, my son-in-law, a decent, hard-working man, is getting caught up in a typical profiteering atmosphere common in war situations where rebuilding is going on.  He went to Iraq with idealist motivations that are undoubtedly still there in him, but my instincts are telling me it's gotten a bit muddled in the past year.  Second, as a federal employee myself who has seen and continues to see more and more private contracting out of former federal jobs, I'm seeing that the two main reasons put forth for private contractors - saving money, and better/faster production/results - is clearly not happening.  The same problems that the federal government heads had before is still here - no decent oversight, no true accountability.  Who watches the watchers?!  * Which just lost them a  urlLink lucrative buyout  with Lockheed...

      After making an initial investment to begin rebuilding a property destroyed by fire, a Belgian company was prohibited from creating jobs in a small rural Illinois town by a last-minute revision and passing of a bill the state legislature had originally rejected.  It is now illegal to slaughter horses for the purpose of producing horsemeat products currently in demand in Europe.   urlLink Reference   It has been illegal to sell horsemeat in Illinois to be consumed in Illinois.   But a lucrative market already exists overseas. This was to be the target audience for products produced at the Big Foot, IL (population 85) facility.

      Here is a list of issues you can find at the  urlLink Democrat website  which they put forth as their talking-points against the current administration.  I took a look at their issues and I come up with the same thing as always; does anybody really pay attention to the facts and the issues anymore? By this I include both majors, btw, but in this episode just the Dems.  This, I think, is the consequence of dumbing-down the issues for people. Why do we allow our politicians to make like we're extra-dumb every 4 years?   The democrat titles are bulleted. My replies follow.    •   The Bush 2005 Budget: A Deficit Disaster  The dems lead off with a home run. No question about it. This is the great stinking mess in the republican closet. But the argument they present here is strictly quotes from  urlLink Cato  and  urlLink The Heritage Foundation . As if the democrats can't come up with reasons against deficits on their own I suppose - they have to use conservative think tanks to make their argument? But hold on - this use will be important later. Of course it may be because they were just as surprised about the budget surpluses under President Clinton as anyone. I mean - are the democrats any better at fiscal conservatism than the current republican bunch? Ya think?   •   Bush Tax Cuts Help the Rich Get Richer  There's been ample data showing this to be a ridiculous claim based on the class war mentality of the democrats. An entire new tax bracket (10%) was created by the Bush administration, lowering 40,000,000 people out of the 15% tax bracket. The average family bringing in something like $40,000 a year before taxes is now keeping an extra $1000+.   Of course they miss the real problem - or don't have the wit to mention it because their policies over the last 40 years make them just as complicit - but the REAL concern about this is related to the above issue; read this from the  urlLink Brookings Institute ; "tax cuts are not simply a matter of returning unneeded or unused funds to taxpayers, but rather a choice to require other, future taxpayers to cover the long-term deficit, which the tax cut significantly exacerbates."  Meaning... when you build deficits and lower the revenue you are taking a gamble. It is a calculated gamble in that if the economy does start to fly higher because of it all the revenues increase you made it ok - but if it doesn't, you blew it. Theoretically you should make it - that's stricty supply side. But the deal is - you are shooting crap with it to some degree. It is a matter of timing.   Anyway point being the democrats missed the issue altogether to pander their usual whine.   •   The Bush Record on Manufacturing Jobs  This is a real funny one because they cite data collected by people who were shown to be insane or something by a review of their work in  urlLink this article .  An excerpt reads;  "Unfortunately, it looks as though indefensible assertions about the supposed long-term disappearance of U.S. manufacturing are going to become a familiar political complaint over the coming year (as well as a promising source of special interest campaign funds). This rerun of the old "downsizing" story will again bore us with many more efforts by bumbling business writers and their slumbering editors to trump up some sort of "public agitation." If the rhetoric gets too annoying, ask the authors for a few facts. They just hate that.   Indeed - what the democrats present here is just a complete bald faced lie. And one wonders how they can use the folks at Cato for part of their argument (on deficits) but forget this part.  Well... no... one doesn't really wonder...    •   The Bush Record on Labor  An extension of the above, this is basically a complaint about the diminishing role of trade unions and organized labor. Doesn't say anything about the union head's enforcing affinity on their rank and file for democrat contributions though.   I think the real record of abuse of "labor" comes from the left. They're the ones with a vested interest in their being a permanent working-class. How else do they maintain a voting base?   •   Health Care Costs Skyrocket Under Bush  What bothers me about this is its disingenuous. The real issue here is they are still sniping about the Clintons' health plan being scuttled a few years ago. But two thing I never hear mentioned is if healthcare costs went up without a tax-supported plan, what the hell difference would it have made if we pay more now or pay more first as the money was taken on the front end through taxes to support the plan? Hello??  Besides which, nobody has bothered to show how a policy from the White House DIRECTLY made health costs go up. This is like sour grapes or something.   •   Another Bush Ripoff: Health Savings Accounts  Democrats use a code language that encompasses Health Savings Accounts, Personal Social Security Accounts and School Vouchers. To them, the real thing that bothers them about privatizing certain aspects of the government is they'll have their bureaucrat cronies losing jobs to independent investment advisors - who are usually republicans.   Don't fool yourself - this is why they're opposed to these kinds of plans and for no other reason.   •   The Bush Record on Energy  This is one that rankles me. They block exploration in the western hemisphere and then moan about not enough self-reliance. They moan about an over-spent budget but they want to throw millions into research projects for wind turbine cars and such.   Don't even get me started...   •   The Hazards of Halliburton  This amounts to a poitical cheap shot. But to be honest, both web sites have their own little cheap shot sections, but what differentiates the democrats is they've elevated theirs to POLICY.    man... i gotta get a life...

       Those damn conservative neanderthals at  urlLink The New Republic      (excerpt: Now let's summarize Moore's "conclusion": that the Bush family was, by its close financial ties with the bin Laden family, passively complicit in 9/11; that the administration did too little to apprehend the perpetrators of that massacre; that it invaded Afghanistan primarily to get an oil pipeline built; that it shifted the nation's resources to Iraq solely in order to appease oil interests and to enrich its own members; and that it lied about all of this. If William Raspberry really believes all this, then he should tell us why and how. But if he doesn't, he should have the basic integrity to say that Moore's movie is not just "sly" but a fantastical piece of malevolent propaganda whose only connective thread is a pathological demonization of the President of the United States. Raspberry cannot have it both ways. And the fact that he tries to get away with it says a lot about how corrupted the left has become in our national discourse.    and  urlLink Newsweek  are at it again!   Why don't they go see the movie before they open their republican yaps!

      When I was a lad I learned my politics at the feet of Abbie Hoffman. I considered myself a radical. I wanted the government of LBJ brought down. Fast, hard, and final. We weren't the violent ones, but we didn't mind the ones that  were  violent all that much.  We used to rave against the government because it would prop up banana-republic dictators as allies during the Cold War.   Does the Left actually prefer banana-republic dictators these days? That would certainly be a change from back in my day.  The single largest criticism of American foreign policy during that era - we used to use - was that the only kind of friend America could muster were ones who eventually brutalized their own people.  So... what happened to you guys? What kind of moral compass is being used these days?  Civilians have died as a result of military action by the United States in Iraq that toppled Saddam Hussein. The action was aimed at military targets in an effort to destroy Iraqi defense forces used to defend the Hussein regime. Pinpoint weaponry was used in an effort to minimize civilain casualties.  Civilians also died as a result of a campaign generated by Saddam Hussein specifically to kill civilians who were opposed to his regime. People regardless of age, sex, or background were pinpointed for torture and execution in an effort to maximize the campaign's effect. At least one field of buried corpses has been unearthed.   urlLink This guy  has made his moral choice. Now the Left obviously  prefers  dictators - so long as they are anti-American.   Has the Left lost its mind?

      I lead such a sheltered life in here that I had to have another blogger point out to me that the definitive review of Fahrenheit 9/11 had been done a week and a half ago. I missed it altogether, I sighed.  It was written by Christopher Hitchens, and forms a pretty final judgement on his rotundity I'd say.   What makes it, in my mind anyway, the final word is the fact that it can be said that Hitchens - a left-wing commentator of long-standing reputation who spares no one their foible - would probably be viewed by most who know of him as being on the "same side" as people like Moore. Funny thing isn't it?  I would guess that a great many of the Left would rather we not see Hitchens' work on this subject. More's the pity. Well... obviously Hitchens saw the film, which is still a damn sight more than I can say about myself -  or the film's defenders .  Below this post -a few days back - I recorded some suspicions about the flick; two actually. One suspicion said that the over-fawning, glowing review I had read led me to believe that Moore's chief tactic was the old "have it both ways" syndrome because the reviewer actually thought this was a  good  thing (You know... President Bush is just so stupid and he's actually the evil genius of the world all at the same time). The other suspicion wondering aloud what relevence a question posed to pro-war congressman about whether or not they were letting their sons go to Iraq in the age of No Draft would have.  And it seems, by the look of things, my suspicions are confirmed. And then some!  I read Mr Hitchens review and thought of all the people who defended the film (who also hadn't seen it yet), and wondered how they would explain the intellectual dishonesty they had to engage in to make the defense.   I know how I deal with my intellectual dishonesty when I do it... I make believe it never happened. I wonder how that would be possible for them in this case...   urlLink Watch  this  drive...   Then I want an answer.

      After a while, at least in my addled mind, violence begins to seem humorous. There are a host of movies and books that were nothing but an endless menu of gratuitous and omnipresent action. Maybe it is a guy thing; the 3 Stooges  do  come to mind.  And it isn't that one becomes desensitized to it as much as it is the complete absurdity of violence begins to foster a kind of inate rejection - rejection which is demonstrated as laughter. It is just too much, after a while, to be anything but ridiculous.   I'm afraid this feeling has taken hold of me fairly often in the last few years whenever the subject turns to the middle east.  Certainly  NOT  polite to laugh. Surely insensitive, considering the level of mayhem, and the precious youth of many of the victims of the violence - one side or the other. But I can't help it.  Based on the premise that human beings will always try to change a condition they find intolerable - whether in the landscape of their mind or out in the realities of the world around them - it becomes clear that the history of the last 40-some-odd years (unless you want to go 3000 years further) would tend to demonstrate that the people who live in the middle east actually  like it this way.   I mean - as callous and even racial as that may sound - face it; people are mostly about solving their problems, but when they stew in them and they won't solve and they won't get handled and one step up equals three steps back and people get passive/aggressive and lie and hide and head right back out into the trenches and NOTHING ever changes year after year after decade after decade... after a while I think it may be reasonable to suggest that the people in the midst of it all actually  love this stuff.   It is a cycle of absurdity, really.   Killing, murder, suicide, hatred, tears, bloodfeud. Anguish and grief. Anger and loathing. Revenge and killing again. Guns. Bombs. Bodies desecrated and blown apart, blood all over the streets, heads chopped off, houses demolished, rockets firing from helicopters, checkpoints, guns again, death and dying. Secrets. Weapons hidden. Intentions hidden. Nothing surrendered. Nobody gives an inch. Just go and die and kill and maim and destroy and hurt and cry and scream and run for your life. People  want  to see children in tears, they  want  their enemy's parents to trust nothing and cower in their homes, they  want  to tally the losses,  want  to do the body count. A circus of grief and slaughter and screaming and hatred.  You know... Nation Building.  We've tried, everyone has tried, individuals sometimes step forward from among the participants  themselves  and try, to do something - ANYTHING. Serious negotiation. Threats from without. Bribery with grants. Negotiations and deals and sign-the-line, and shake the hands. Nothing works. It doesn't go away. We've all tried just about everything there is to try...  Except we haven't laughed at it yet. Point at it with one hand and put the other hand on our bellies and just laugh.   Laugh at it. Laugh so hard we cry. Give it the French-wave and walk away, chuckling.  Isn't that what you're  supposed  to do when something becomes absurd?

      I have held for some time (and have been called a  racist  for it) that the Democratic Party and the media's  accepted  "Black Leadership" absolutely requires a permanent underclass in order to exist.   And because of the tight control the Language Police have on the vernacular, it sometimes bothers people when I say that it is black Americans in the Democratic Party who are the ones "stuck on the plantation."   Though my point is really a rather unobnoxious one in comparison to the hateful hyperbole of people like Al Sharpton (whither Tawana?) and Louis Farrakhan (White People are from, like, beyond Jupiter even), it is simply unacceptable for a white guy to take issue with the construct of the liberal black paradigm in America. It isn't done. It isn't supposed to be done. It is considered intellectual death.  The problem is that white American conservatives have often done a sickeningly poor job of distancing and disassociating themselves from skinheads and white supremacists and such-like idiots at large in society. That's why it is often seen as a no-no.     Recently Bill Cosby stirred the pot just a wee bit with some biting points of order. Now - we'll know that PC is dead, and free speech is back in vogue, when a white man can say those things and not be dismissed out of hand. So long as the commentary is made in honesty and without hatred - that's the meaning of the amendment back in the saddle.  This is the long way around the barn of introducing true independent voices in this country who can't be bought, can't be fooled, and won't be stopped. It would be wrong to say this is a new thing - that's exactly the misconception that does nobody any good. These voices have always been there, but it was difficult to hear them in the past; when their own leadership (which, again, requires a permanent underclass in order to exist) and a smarmy establishment media conspired (de facto) to marginalize them.  Listen to  urlLink Cobb :  The Civil Rights Movement is over. It was, despite continuing rhetoric to the contrary, a complete success. All that is required from this point on is a modicum of vigilance. We should act as if it's done because it is done. Nobody is going to roll back the clock. Nobody is going to steal the money that Robert Johnson made from BET. Nobody is going to firebomb any churches, sic dogs or use firehoses on blacks who want to vote or otherwise use the American system. Nobody is going to keep blacks out of the stock market, public universities, hospitals, the officer's ranks of the armed services, government employment. A few isolated individual may try, but they cannot and will not succeed.    Pay attention when  urlLink DC Thornton  says:  I used to be a left-wing Democrat. Then came September 11, 2001 and its aftermath. Leftism reared its ugly head of hate and bigotry, which forced me to open my eyes. I no longer want any part of it. I also feel that the Democratic party is headed into irrelevance as its soul continues to be consumed by hatred and socialism. Some of my black peers have branded me as a “sellout” for not thinking the way self-appointed leaders want me to think and refusing to submit myself to separatist/collectivist thought. Those who don’t like my opinions can call the Law Offices of Tuff & Schitt. As far as I know, being black isn’t synonymous with being assimilated by the Borg Collective.    Connect the dots when  urlLink La Shawn Barber  tells you:  It's sad to see so many lives wasted by the liberal ideology of blame, grievances and victimhood.   And in case the passing reader is now ascending into that rarified (but expected) moral indignation so common when confronted with this kind of thing (you know... the very original  well of course this white guy loves his house n______. ), sit up and take note when  urlLink Crispus  (Shay Riley) minces no words when right is right and wrong is wrong no matter where it comes from:  Last week, Congress hailed the 40th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act. Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX), a libertarian Republican, was the only dissenter. Rep. Paul argues that the CRA didn't improve race relations or enhance individual freedom, but instead dictated "forced integration." This is where I part ways with most white libertarians. Reading this piece reminded me of comments by Michael Bowen, a black Republican, hoping that "black libertarians could neutralize some of [Libertarians'] post-modernist yuppie crap in the process." This is one of those times.   So don't get me wrong. This isn't a blog entry about "Independent Black Voices." I'm not talking about "Conservative Black People." Nothing like that at all.  I'm just informing you about some  urlLink Americans  I know is all..

      A few bloggers  urlLink react  to a so-called   urlLink speech  that no one can verify actually happened.  The transcript of this speech if flying at the speed of light around the Internet, appealing to those that like to spread fear and hate.    What's really sneaky about it is there are points here and there where your head my nod in agreement, but if you read it carefully, you'll see it's just the Red Scare all over again.  When are people going to realize that it's the same sh*t all over again? History is screaming at us but we're too deaf, dumb, or stubborn to hear let alone learn from it.   I don't like what I'm hearing and reading when countries, cultures, and religions are painted with wide brushes; it doesn't help anyone or anything.    Thankfully, many of us live very nice lives, but if we were in their shoes, what would WE do?  I'll tell you - the same damn thing.  It's called pain, anger, sadness, and desperation.    What do we do then?  We try to do the best we can, use our heads, and in the end (knock on wood), try and get ALL of us to get along.  Simplistic?  Yes.  But it's not optional.  We have to try because the alternative is unthinkable...*  * The devil is in the details

       Question :  Based on the second-hand smoke arguments,  urlLink a report  recently out from  our government concerning dogs and cats says studies prove that  second-hand   allergens can wreak havoc with people sensitive to them.  Doesn't current logic then lead us to extending “NO PETS ALLOWED” beyond residential buildings to whole areas of cities to prevent the suffering and health-related risks many suffer from said allergens?   While I fully appreciate carcinogenic health risks of smoking, some of the laws being enacted concerning smoking now make as much sense as Prohibition did.  It’s reactionary legal mumbo jumbo.

      I'm a very selfish bastard, but I'm usually the dummy who makes the first move. This is the story of my life.  It holds true with this blogging experience as well.   I don't watch the news, I don't watch any TV unless it is football season, and I have no idea who some of these bright young things are in the entertainment world. Never heard of them.  I do read a lot of blogs.  And from time to time if I am most impressed with a blog, I put it on our Blogroll, and I TELL the person I've done it.   What happens after that might be instructive.  I keep the link up no matter what happens if the blog is truly exceptional.  urlLink Matt Welch  and  urlLink the Flybottle  come to mind. These are just two of the best blogs I have ever seen and the ideas that are addressed by these guys feed me with each and every post they make. I admire them, and am trying desperately to match their standards.  There's another set of links of people I've gotten to know online through their blogs and we've exchanged links and we have a little mini-alliance going. These are the true friends. We may not agree on everything but there is a mutual respect going on. And that means a lot.  Then there's people I have put on the blogroll because I enjoyed their material and invited them to look in on us - who mysteriously don't return the link.  Unless their writing reaches an astonishing level, eventually these people get dumped.   There's no set period of time they have to pass through, "beyond one week and you're out," because they may be there on account of their writing.   But for those who look in and either are "too busy" or actually didn't like what they saw and didn't return the link... see ya. I'm not your "link-slave."   I'm a very selfish bastard.

      I still haven't seen  Fahrenheit 9/11 , but my fellow team member's review sounds informed and what I expected.    I have been a war blog reader of both sides - Coalition and Iraqi - mostly individual soldiers and civilians living the actual war experience, with some independent journalists thrown in, such as Chris Allbritton's  urlLink Back to Iraq .  I've also avidly followed  urlLink circus -performer-to-Iraqi-kids (and activist)  urlLink Jo Wilding , not to mention  urlLink my own son-in-law's experience  as a translator.    I have had a wide range of experiences reported by the individuals I read, but overall it paints a very negative picture. Yes, there were those exceptions like  urlLink Chief Wiggles .  He saw the good in the Iraqi people, and did what he could as an interrogator of high level prisoners to make bridges with the past into the future, but men like him in my search seemed few and far between.  I can only hope that seeds have been sown that we just don't know about, that will bear positive fruit in the years to come.  For now, however, there are many  urlLink innocent deaths  brought about by a combination of bad planning, inexperienced and frightened young soldiers, and cultural misunderstandings.*  Opportunists on both sides together with pain and sadness turned into anger and hatred will fuel further tumoil.  Is it hopeless?  The effort to make the world a better place for all is never hopeless, nor futile, in my opinion.  It's one of the most honorable of pursuits, one person and one action at a time...  * Many deaths are being reported by individuals that are not from one of those reasons, and are happening because for bad reasons, under circumstances that deserve  urlLink crimes of war  status...

      Going into Fahrenheit 9/11 I had the advantage of already reading some of the criticisms from some of the links provided on this board, so there’s no question I was prepared for some of the scenes which other movie-goers may have swallowed hook, line, and sinker.  I’m trying to be honest here, so I must admit that had I not read some of the reviews, I may have easily accepted the Bush ties to Carlyle and the pipeline across Afghanistan without looking any deeper.  It’s hard to stay on one’s toes at all times, and I hate to see someone with whom I agree with politically use the same tactics as Rush.  Left-wing dittoheads just don’t feel right to me.  So on the negative side it appears that Moore wasn’t totally honest with some of his points.  The claims about Bush letting the Saudis leave the country after 9/11 was just plain wrong.  Clarke made the decision and took full responsibility for it.  He made it appear as some of his claims were a slam-dunk when in fact some of them were circumstantial.  Does that mean he should have left them out of the movie?  Absolutely not.  But he should have been more honest in how they were presented.  What really pisses me off is that there was no reason to do that.  He had enough positive points and there was so much worthwhile about this movie that by doing so he opens the door of criticism.  Had he clearly stated what was circumstantial and what was not, it would have been just that much better.  On the positive side, there was much in this movie which needed to be shown and Moore did a very good job of presenting it.  In my opinion, everyone should see the scenes depicting the carnage and grief in Iraq.  Everyone should see the scenes of the soldiers mocking the Iraqi prisoners and their dead.  And everyone should see the mother from Flint who lost her son in the war.  Why?  Because there are so many Americans who have no connection to most of humanity and live comfortably with their “us against them” worldview.  We need to understand, as much as possible, the heartache that war causes. Maybe next time we won’t so easily agree with the call for war without demanding to see the “slam dunk proof” before we kill, not after.    We should also all think long and hard about the fact that of all the members in congress, only one has a son serving in the military.  Only one.  That doesn’t sound like the people representing us really know what it’s like to be us.  And it doesn’t sound like the people making the decision to go to war have as much at stake as the people for whom they are making the decision.  Something stinks here, and it doesn’t matter to me whether there is a draft or not.  If you don’t play the game, you don’t make the rules.  Shame on us for continuously electing politicians who have no clue what it’s like to have to tell your son that the best way for him to get a college education would be to join the military.   Everyone should also listen to the quotes from Cheney, Bush, and Rice before 9/11 when they gave their views on how Iraq was being confined and that it posed no imminent threat.  We should all be asking why their views changed so abruptly after 9/11 and the events which had nothing to do with Iraq.  Remember, this is the same claim made by Richard Clarke, the man who had enough integrity to take responsibility for letting Saudis fly out of the U.S.    My biggest complaints of the Bush administration have always been (1) weak effort at going after the Al Qaida in Afghanistan, and (2) using 9/11 as a justification for war in Iraq and misleading the American people about the WMD’s.  If that concerns you also, and you want to watch the cold hard facts without the emotion and without Moore’s spin, pop yourself a bag of popcorn and click  urlLink here .  Then go see Fahrenheit 9/11, but read the critics first.

      Down in the "Lies of Michael Moore" thread an intrepid reader revisits comments I made relative to the review of facts made in Christopher Hitchens' piece on the "film in question."   I would point out to the reader that we are under constraints here at the Yard - in that the originator of an article is allowed one response per comment and I have - thus - shot my wad... as it were. If I have not put my point to you well enough it is my own fault.  Our mission here is to rest on point/counterpoint and walk away. The theory is that after too much time a prodigious thread starts to become less about the issue and more about the egos involved. So I will have to let stand what I said last on the subject to dear Bobs and if I failed to make my point - I have no one to blame but myself.  Here at the Yard, our guests are guaranteed the Last Word.  ------------------------------------------  On another issue I am very upset about the inconsistent service blogger.com has established as a norm. There are times people can't click here, other times when comments don't appear for indecent stretches of time, and misfires on re-publishing and moving through links.  I'm not a patient person. If these problems continue we will up stakes and find another home. I wasn't happy with the templates in the first place but there we are.  I'll keep everyone posted.  -----------------------------------------=  And finally, a thank you to those of you who return again and again (per my site meter)... now TALK TO US!

      Ok – we did  urlLink the Democrat agenda  for the coming election a few days ago. Now here’s the other guys.  urlLink The GOP . I have to say I’m equally nonplussed.  Tell me something, when are you people who drink the Democrat & Republican koolaid going to stop futzing around like a bunch of robots and think for yourself? This “lesser of two evils” crap isn’t working… haven’t you noticed? A pox on both your houses…   President Bush's Plan to Grow the Economy and Create Jobs  I think Presidents get too much credit when the economy is good, and too much blame when it is bad. Market cycles happen regardless of Presidents. Most of the time when they do have an effect on these cycles it is a bad one – like Nixon’s wage and price freezes and other socialistic central-planning nonsense comes to mind.  The thing that gets me on this agenda is the line that says the plan is to “Promote investment by individuals and businesses that will lead to economic growth and job creation.” Part of doing this was supposedly accomplished by a reduction in taxation on dividends. That was a good move but only to a degree. Brokers have given long-standing advice that actually steered people away from stocks that pay dividends on the grounds that you should be investing in companies who put the money back into the business for growth, not in the pocket.   So what’s the plan? Right now in lieu of a national health care plan, American business is being forced to foot the bill for a share of insurance costs for their employees. For many companies this expense rises in two-digit percent territory annually.   To improve itself, a business has to reinvest its profits, grow itself, and stay positioned to compete by marshalling its resources. Nothing in the Republican “plan” addresses any specific handling of this or similar aspects. Cutting dividend taxation does not help small businesses grow, so the GOP presents the idea that “Every small business owner who purchases equipment to grow and expand will get assistance through an increase in the expensing limits from $25,000 to $75,000.”  Meaning if you buy equipment you get what amounts to a larger tax credit. That sounds good – but it makes my supply-side rankle. Why is there a limit at all when it comes to expanding one’s capacity?   Doesn't a business that is increasing its capacity, its production, and its contribution to the market thereby also increase the revenues it generates in taxes for the government?  So...?   Protecting the American People / A National Security Strategy that Meets the Challenges of Our Time  On this and for another I am combining two areas the GOP split on their website because there is no intrinsic difference in value between the two issues. Makes the agenda look larger though in their behalf.  Did someone say Homeland Security. Tell me – what part of “abrogation of our right to due process under the law” do you not understand?   The Patriot Act is reason enough to not vote Republican. We should only be thankful it wasn’t drawn up by democrats – as it would then probably be three times as infringing.   People give you the old wave when you tell them you have problems with the Patriot Act. "If you haven’t done anything wrong, you have nothing to worry about” is not a constitutional principle – it’s a rationalization. The constitution and the bill of rights did not get written based on the notion that “what’s good enough for the mafia is good enough for the terrorists.” The constitution and the Bill of Rights got written to protect the citizen with due process and judicial oversight –  urlLink two things assaulted in this act  – and not just of foreigners    The weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was an overstated threat, but for whatever other reasons we are there – we are there. We have to move from this point the best we can.   The longer we stay the harder it will be to leave. The Iraqi government must quickly be seen as independent of the US, and it must be clear they do not depend on the armed forces of the United States to keep them in office.   urlLink Iraq had ties to al Qaeda  - that were known as far back as 1999, if only relative to keeping out of each others' way – but that isn’t even the point any more. If we went into Iraq for the same reasons we went into Afghanistan (flush out sources of support, bases of operation, funding, and the potential for harmful material for use or aid in terrorism against the US) then the mission is over and accomplished pending a viable government in Baghdad – which can’t be viable so long as it is viewed as a puppet of the US.   It can't be simpler.Except that isn't how the Republican agenda expresses it. Why?   No Child Left Behind  President as Nanny. What happened to vouchers? The democratic mayor of Washington DC is instituting them and people LIKE them. Why is the President stuck in old-school thinking on this topic?   Keeping the Promise of Social Security / President Bush’s Agenda for Improving Health Care  We went into this a little on the democratic side and I stand by what I said about them. Their biggest reason for being opposed to these kinds of things has more to do with reducing the size of government and therefore the amount of government jobs in their gift than it has to do with anything else they may say.   But what I want to know is – the Congress is majority Republican and the President is a Republican too (if you notice), so why is this still just a “plan” and not a reality?  My impression here is this is merely rhetoric to energize the faithful – like “abortion” gets people on both sides moving.   Funny – isn’t it – that the last few times the GOP has had a majority in the congress and a President, we heard a lot about amendments to the constitution to outlaw flag burning, but their pet Right To Life project stuck in neutral. Still there.  Ah!  Hot-button issues we don’t want to actually ever go away so we can pound them every four years and energize our voting base.  You gotta love ‘em.    Improved Air Quality for All Americans  A chicken in every pot. A car in every garage.    President Calls on Congress to Act on Energy Plan  See the bit on “Promise of Social Security” above and apply here as well.  Except if we’re going to put millions of dollars into developing alternative sources of energy – what difference does it make if I vote Republican or not? Hell… everybody has this plan. I want somebody in the Oval Office willing to say – let the market determine what happens here. An oil price that isn’t artificially low (which is what we still have, close to $2 a gallon or not) will be a more efficient catalyst toward alternatives than any government-subsidized engine.

      Thanks to  urlLink Matt Welch,  the oft-employed observer at  urlLink Reason   (the best magazine on the planet - how can you not like a magazine that publishes articles like “Enemy Guidelines; Tips for distinguishing between terrorists and innocent bystanders")for revealing to us the location of one of the more outstanding websites I've seen in a long time.  I was so impressed I made a permanent link. To those who have never seen it - meet  urlLink Spinsanity , the mission of which is to be "countering rhetoric with reason."  On the first page you will see articles debunking wild, baseless claims from the left / alongside ads for their new publication titled "All the President's Spin" complete with a representation of the President with his fingers crossed behind his back.  From the look of things this may be just the source those of us who believe in nothing may have been looking for all this while.  Give it a go...

          "Sacred cows make the tastiest hamburger." -  Abbie Hoffman   In 1970 at the age of 17 I was hawking copies of a newspaper known as the  Chicago Seed . In it was the stuff you might expect for the era; Smash the State, End the War, Alternative Politics, Freedom.   I suppose I took all that a bit too seriously for my tender age, looking back. If you must know I was idealistic enough to believe in that, but practical enough to know that if I hung out in these circles the sex and drugs would follow. A dreamer I was - an idiot I was not.  I did that for a long time. I lived in the Chicago area during the infamous '68 convention and it had a marked effect on me even at 15. Yeah ok - it was a fad/thing but in time I went to school on it and involved myself as a grunt in the lines of the Counter-Culture well into the 70s.  You don't notice things happening on a day-to-day basis when you're involved in a thing like that. You aren't in on policy-making and you're more into the scene than the details. But I distinctly recall going door to door in a rich Chicago suburb (without a permit) with a partner after having been dispatched by a group known as  urlLink Citizens For a Better Environment  back in the early 70s to get donations for whatever they were about back then. And I remember one particular house we came to. The door was answered by this woman - probably in her early 30s at the time - who could have stepped out of the pages of Playboy. Well-dressed and all the equipment and a face and a voice and a perfume and when I got back on my feet I heard my partner give our little speech and she shook her head and started in on on us about how  "You're going to regret getting the government involved in every aspect of your life. In time you're not going to want the government to have that much say in your business or your economy. You have to let the market handle what is essentially a property rights issue."   No - seriously! That's exactly what she said. I remember it because that voluptuous voice was all I could imagine for the rest of the night.  "You're going to regret getting the government involved in every aspect of your life."   I don't know if it was the unexpected educated clarity that came out of that particular package or what it was... but I swear to you from that day on I began to look at things a bit differently.  I had been out there in the streets   - I thought - telling people to smash the state, and began to realize what I was ending up doing was  becoming  the state. And not the state we had - but a state that was, indeed, getting more and more involved in my life as each year passed.   The  urlLink Free Speech Movement  that was born in Berkeley in the early 60s had morphed into the Politically Correct Speech Movement. Alternative Politics became a permanent place at the table of the Democratic Party (which we had denounced because they got us escalated into Viet Nam big time) and the most ambitious among us began speaking of the benefits of the Two Party System.   It didn't dawn on most what was happening. We never noticed that while all that was morphing, Abbie Hoffman was living "underground" while being chased all over the country by the FBI for what amounted to a trumped-up cocaine charge. Think we would have noticed? Made the connection? Not really.  So by the end of the 70s, as the residue of the counter-culture became the mainstream, the battle was over. Most - in the estimation of a few of us - caved. They caved to power and they caved to practicality and they caved to the fact that there really was no basis for their personal belief system.   Some of us are just sticks-in-the-mud though - you know? Here it is 2004 and at the age of almost 51 I am hawking blogging on a thing known as the  internet . And in my stuff you might not read into what I'm saying, but its the usual stuff; Smash the State, End the War, Alternative Politics, Freedom.   The liberals do nothing for  liberty , and the government is everywhere. That wasn't what I was in the streets for 30+ years ago.   urlLink Related Post / Original Whine on the subject.

       I enjoy&nbsp; debate and dicussion; but&nbsp;I&nbsp;find polemics to be boring and destructive.&nbsp;When a commenter accuses me of being a "neo-Marxist",&nbsp;or "left-wing fascist",&nbsp;my interest in their&nbsp;argument&nbsp;quickly falls to&nbsp;zero.&nbsp;The commenter is a polemicist, he is not interested in truth.  &nbsp;  In constructive debate and dicussion,&nbsp;the audience&nbsp;and writer&nbsp; accept&nbsp;certain rights:  1. to remain unconvinced,  2.to perceive a contradiction  3.&nbsp;to require more information  4. to emphasize different ideas  5. to point out faulty logic  &nbsp;  The polemicist goes farther than taking away those rights. The polemicist will gladly enter an&nbsp;intellectual&nbsp;debate,but he will always have reached his conclusion before he hears the first argument.&nbsp;He will never agree to question whether&nbsp;his philosophy is ideal, legitimate, or even possible.&nbsp;If the polemicist identifies&nbsp;himself with Marxism, than he will respond to&nbsp;criticisms of&nbsp;his philosophy by&nbsp;accusing the critics of&nbsp;being part of&nbsp;the&nbsp;"petty bourgeoisies". Yet, he will never asses the merits or drawbacks of his view. The polemicist does not see those who&nbsp;challenge his assumptions&nbsp;as partners in the search of truth; he sees them as enemies, whose very existence&nbsp;constitutes a&nbsp;threat. The polemicist always relies on a legitimacy that his challengers are denied by definition.  &nbsp;  The polemicists is capable of the most flagrant dishonesty:&nbsp;once he makes up his mind, he will persuade himself that his opinion, by definition,&nbsp;is the most righteous and correct. In the case of Marxists and Fundamentalists,&nbsp;you will often find unshakable beliefs, even when the facts (and indeed, the majority of people) are overwhelmingly in opposition.&nbsp; The polemicists&nbsp;seems to be fully&nbsp;unaware of&nbsp;his own dishonesty.  &nbsp;  The polemicist loves to&nbsp;use&nbsp;vague&nbsp;or meaningless&nbsp;nomenclature to label&nbsp;his opponents. Rush Limbaugh has single handedly hijacked the word "liberal", which has dozens of meanings ranging from the capitalist of the 1830's, to the libertarian views of Thomas Jefferson, to porky-pig New Deal big government spenders. Yet, Rush, and most of his listeners, are content with the conclusion that Mr.X is "liberal" and therefore "bad". However this comes as no surprise, as George Orwell once remarked:      Political language -- and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists -- is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.      &nbsp; While our political language blurs our grasp on reality, it unquestionably benefits those who would want us to conform to their views.  &nbsp;  A great deal of polemicists would see&nbsp;grossly obvious facts, &nbsp;if&nbsp;it were&nbsp;not for the&nbsp;emotions that are involved. But the loyalty of a polemicist to their own reality makes&nbsp; the facts&nbsp;intolerable, thus he will construct false theories to aid in their denial. For example, Mussolini and Marx's "theories of history" boiled down to the future being already set in stone.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is a polemicist in some respects, and it takes a moral effort to overcome it. One can begin by recognizing&nbsp;that some causes are objectively better than others, regardless of the past means that have been used to advance them. One must reflect upon the source of their&nbsp;beliefs,&nbsp;and than make&nbsp;allowances for the inevitable bias. Once you recognize the existence of polemics, you can begin to overcome its power. As Clarence Darrow once remarked, "Chase after the truth like hell, even though you'll never catch it by the coat tails."

      Thanks to the  urlLink League of Women Voters / Democracy Net  project for gleaning this information from candidate & party web sites. These are the only issues I could find mutual responses to. Some issues have missing reports.     The "Opening Statement"   Kerry (D)  I'm running for President to make the country we love safer, stronger, and more secure. I'm asking every American to be a Citizen Soldier again committed to leaving no American behind.  Bush (R) Incumbent  There is still much work to be done in Washington.Strengthen health care. Pass  prescription drug coverage for seniors. Continue to expand economic opportunities. Committed to expanding the reach of freedom across the globe, for our own security and for the benefit of the world.  Badnarik (L)  We advocate strict non-interventionist policies abroad. We advocate scaling back the size of the federal government to those powers and authorities specifically specified by the Constitution of the United States.     Iraq  Kerry (D)  We may have differences about how we went into Iraq, but we do not have the choice just to pick up and leave--and leave behind a failed state and a new haven for terrorists.  Bush (R) Incumbent  Our agenda in Iraq is freedom, independence, security, and prosperity for the Iraqi people. Our coalition has clear goals: to stop terrorism wherever it exists and to see the Iraqi people in charge of Iraq for the first time in generations. America's task in Iraq is not only to defeat an enemy, but also to give strength to a friend. And the sooner this goal is achieved, the sooner our job will be done.  Badnarik (L)  Begin the orderly process of bringing our troops home as quickly as can safely be accomplished. Strict non-interventionist, a libertarian foreign policy is one of national defense, and not international offense. It would protect our country, not police the world.     Health Care Costs  Kerry (D)  There is no reason that young people in our great nation should lack quality health care coverage, yet young Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 are more likely to lack coverage than any other age group. My plan will tackle this challenge by bringing down skyrocketing health care costs, which make it difficult for millions of Americans - young and old - to afford quality, reliable coverage.  Bush (R) Incumbent  Health Savings Accounts, established by the Medicare Modernization Act combine a low-cost, high-deductible policy with tax-free contributions to the HSA by individuals and their employers. These accounts allow young people to save money tax-free to meet routine medical expenses and to cover future out-of-pocket costs. Association Health Plans (AHPs) to expand insurance coverage options for workers. AHPs would make it easier for small businesses to save on health care costs by negotiating together with other small businesses on behalf of their employees and their families. We would also help small businesses and employees obtain health insurance at an affordable price, much like larger employers.  Badnarik (L)  Health care and insurance costs will plummet if excess regulation is eliminated and malpractice awards are made only on the basis of strict liability. Lower costs, along with the savings from downsizing regulatory bureaucracy, will fund tax credits for those who establish Health Savings Accounts for themselves, their families, Medicare/Medicaid recipients, and the needy.     Jobs & The Economy  Kerry (D)  Use government contracts for U.S. workers. Stop giving government contracts to corporations breaking the rules. Consumers need a "Right to Know" on Call Center Workers. End every single tax credit that gives corporations breaks for moving jobs offshore.  Bush (R) Incumbent  Reduction in individual tax rates on dividends and Capital Gains. Increase incentives for small businesses to grow (Current tax laws permit small business owners to write off as expenses up to $25,000 worth of equipment purchases. The President's plan will increase that limit to $100,000 and index it to inflation).  Badnarik (L)  Excess regulation and government spending destroy jobs and increase unemployment. Establishment politicians think that larger, more elaborate government jobs programs are the solution to your problems. However, since these programs must be funded by taking money from the private sector, even more jobs are destroyed---more jobs than the government programs can ever create.     Education  Kerry (D)  Invest in our schools instead of giving tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. Proposing a new 'Education Trust Fund' that means fully funding education. Will support teachers, reduce class sizes, and rebuild crumbling schools.  Bush (R) Incumbent  No Child Left Behind targets resources for early childhood education so that all youngsters get the right start on reading and math. If a school continues to fail some children will be able to transfer to higher-performing local schools, receive free tutoring or attend after-school programs. Under President Bush's leadership federal funding for education has increased 59.8% from 2000 to 2003.  Badnarik (L)  Private institutions, which spend half of what public schools do, graduate a larger percentage of their students with higher levels of academic achievement. Instead of becoming locked into a pay system based on seniority, teachers could own and operate schools, networks, and Internet programs with no ceiling on earnings.  Put the education of our youth back into the hands of parents and teachers through deregulation.    I would have liked to include other candidates, but they weren't available at the site listed. We'll try to maintain this as we go along, if possible.

      Well, at least this one is funnier than most.... I am especially interested in Team Members' results here, though anyone is welcome to try.  Here's the link:  urlLink PERSONALITY TEST   And here's my results... for better or worse I suppose...   You are a WRDL--Wacky Rational Destructive Leader. This makes you an enemy of the state. You are charismatic and winning and a very dangerous enemy. You favor justice over compassion, and would almost rather see your opponent fail than you succeed.  You impact the lives of those around you more than any other personality. People remember your name and respect you. You are a tremendous amount of fun to be around and astonishing to watch. You are generally abstinent in your habits, and you like things tidy and ordered.  When picking teams, it is smartest for others to pick yours.

      You've no doubt seen the old list that has been well-worn around the net called "How To Be A Good Republican." It is an old broadside, and has now been updated to read thus...   How To Be A Good Republican  1. Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him and a bad guy when Bush needed a "we can't find Bin Laden" diversion. 2. Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is Communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony. 3. The United States should get out of the United Nations, and our highest national priority is enforcing U.N. resolutions against Iraq. 4. A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multi-national corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind without regulation. 5.Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals and Hillary Clinton. 6. The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay. 7. A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our long-time allies, then demand their cooperation and money. 8. Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy. Providing health care to all Americans is socialism. 9. HMOs and insurance companies have the best interests of the public at heart. 10. A president lying about an extramarital affair is an impeachable offense.  11. A president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy. 12. The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades, but George Bush's driving record is none of our business. 13. Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a conservative radio host. Then it's an illness and you need our prayers for your recovery. 14. You support states' rights, which means Attorney General John Ashcroft can tell states what local voter initiatives they have the right to adopt.  15. What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest, but what Bush did in the '80s is irrelevant.  Well... I'm no Republican so it isn't any skin off my nose, but you'd think somebody in the GOP would have figured out a counter, right?   Behhhh-Behhhhh!  Wrong.  So here's the counter, provided by a Libertarian. And let me tell you, you Reps should be ashamed of yourselves...   How To Be A Good Democrat  1. America was wrong to prop up second-rate dictators in an effort to fight communism, but its okay to claim second-rate dictators are heroes so long as they oppose the United States now. 2. Trade with China and Viet Nam is wrong because these nations were once enemies of America but trade with Cuba is good because it still is.  3. The United States should get more involved with the United Nations, and let it command Americans in the field. 4. A woman who is against abortion can’t be trusted and we need an all-encompassing government to tell her so. 5.Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of veterans returning from overseas. 6. The best way to improve military morale is to keep our soldiers in dangerous places and leave them poorly equipped in an effort to show how dumb the Republicans were 7. A good way to fight terrorism is to just do whatever they tell you to. 8. Providing health care to all Iraqis is nothing more than buying their affection, but providing health care to Americans isn’t a political catch phrase. 9. The omnipresent government has the best interests of the public at heart. 10. A president lying about an extramarital affair is a boy just being a boy BUT  11. A president trying to explain a war after which thousands will be saved is anti-feminist. 12. The public has a right to know about George Bush's driving record, but Hillary's cattle trades are none of our business. 13. Being a drug addict means you need our prayers for your recovery, unless you're a conservative radio host. Then it is a moral failing and a crime 14. You don’t support states rights, which means only democrats can tell states what to do.  15. What Bill Clinton did to let bin Laden walk in the 90’s is of little concern, but what Bush is doing to try and get him now is all about oil.  You may now resume your regularly scheduled program...

      A few months back I ran across the  ultimate discussion board argument.   After years of this kind of activity I have to admit I'd never seen it before and readily admit it trumps anything I've ever done or said. I wish I would have thought of it long ago. I would have saved myself a lot of wasted effort and headaches from squinting at these screens.  After I had made a lengthy (what else?) explanation of my point of view, all the while doing my best to make the reader feel like he wasn't being talked-down to or being treated like a child, I drew in a response that pretty much went along the lines of...    "you're wrong because I could die any minute."   Now... you must understand... this particular site is the kind of place where the discussion runs sort of like this...   Poster #1; liberals sure are jerks. Poster #2: buncha jerks. Poster #3: yep.   I tried to point out that while the gentleman's condition was sad, there were larger things at work here, and that he wasn't the entire center of the universe. I think telling him he wasn't the center of the universe was what did me in.  Apparently my mistake was in  not  thinking he was the center of the universe. Chuh! What wuz  I  thinkin'!  I recall another poster long ago who, when on the verge of death, lay the complete burden for his financial and familial woes at the doorstep of the Reagan White House and all %&$#*^&'ing Republicans. I recall that specifically. And this poster did, in fact, actually die at a later point. And now here I was again faced with  another  poster on death's door, except THIS one lay the complete burden for  his  financial and familial woes at the doorstep of Jimmy Carter et al...  I guess I never realized that people get sick and miserable because of the dominant politics of the day. Gad - I had always thought people get sick and miserable because people get sick and miserable. What  wuz  I thinkin'?  Now - I don't bring in the issue of my health problems as reasons for dismissing other points of view and I think doing that smacks of ego... as if one is, after all, the only center to the universe. But my irregular heartbeat scares the bejeezus out of nurses who've never seen me before, and there's the meds I am taking for related things to that, and the fact that the men in my family have never gone beyond 61 (ten years away from me), and the other med-mix I take for chronic headaches I have had since a child... none of that is reason to have or not have a political view. And it certainly isn't a reason for that to diminish someone else's point of view.  No?  Then again, on reflection, maybe I should have known what was about to happen - remember the quality of the discussions...   Poster #1: media sure is biased. Poster #2: media sucks. Poster #3" yup.   I may have the same views, but I think I'll hold out for a little more substance in future. It is actually one of the reasons I decided to build this blog and open it up to a team.   But take heed. Everyone should watch out - I have pocketed that ultimate argument and if the going ever gets tough - I'll threaten swooning or something. Anyhow someday I will get to use it too.  Then will you ever be sorry for having an opinion that doesn't agree with mine!

      How does anyone support Bush?  Heaven only knows.  To be honest, I am disillusioned and have a hard time getting excited about anyone.  I guess you could call me an active citizen with Libertarian leanings.  I'm 'Independent', going with who makes the most sense AND does more than talk, but gets things done.  I understand that isn't the way things 'get done', that voting down a party line gives strength in numbers, but the problem is, not everyone in a party is helping make things better.  There are problems in every party just like there are good people in every party.  I dunno.  I'm to the point where I wouldn't be surprised if some charismatic man or woman comes along and sweeps everyone off their feet, and before you know it, we realize it's, gulp, the 'antichrist', but by then, it's too late.  I know, I know, if you are not a believer, that is insane, but there is some truth to the gullibility that people have.  The Bible doesn't call people sheep for nothing...!    I remember my parents talking about FDR years later in negative terms.  Mostly it had to do with his wife.  Huh?!  Anyways, they thought he was giving away the country, and many thought and still do that our financial woes started with FDR and it's been downhill since.  Talk about simplistic.  In North Dakota here, they tend to like Democrats, but only for their Senators/Congressmen.  In Federal elections, they still tend to vote the Elephant.    Did you know that both Bush and Kerry are Skull & Bones (Harvard) Alumni?  I just read an article about them in VANITY FAIR that was to say the least, fascinating.  Talk about a handy organization to be a member of for getting 'connected'.  They were only 2 years apart.  Many are saying in reference to that, that you can put both of them in a hat, shake it, and pull one out, and no matter who you get, it wouldn't make much difference...who knows...

      Regardless of one's affinity to the political right or left, I doubt that any of us would deny that there exists an increasing militancy from the Left.  While dissent is unquestionably a rightful part of our American political heritage, the recent seething rage and dare I say it, apparent hate, from the left is, at least within my lifetime something new.  I recall watching the debates between Carter/Ford and Reagan/Mondale and seeing a (mostly) healthy discussion of the issues.  Certainly their "spin-doctors" were somewhat virulent, but that virulence was never ever main-stream; something that unfortunately has within the past decade become main-stream.  This post is my humble examination/speculation of the development of the militancy we are currently seeing from the Left.  During the mid-term election during President Clinton's first term, you undoubtedly recall the historic sweeping of the Democratic party from both houses of Congress.  That election is the point in time that I see to be the initiation of the Leftist militant rage.  The impeachment proceedings against President Clinton for abuse of power, lying under oath and witness tampering (you know, all those things he admitted to after leaving office), for reasons that are extraneous to this post, seemed to noticeably increase the level of rage from the Left.  While Leftist militant rage was already in place before the election of President Bush (W), the goings on in Florida understandably ruffled many Leftist feathers.  That event/process IMHO greatly elevated Leftist rage as did the recounts by The Miami Herald and USA Today affirming that President Bush did in-deed carry Florida.  Not once since Reconstruction has the party of the sitting president gained seats in the Senate and House in a mid-term election.  As we all know, this did occur during the '02 election; further enraging the Left; especially considering all the effort they expended in successfully regaining the majority in the Senate by coaxing Jim Jeffers to jump from the Republican party to an Independent just a scant couple of months earlier.  Whether my aforementioned observations are correct or not may be an issue for debate.  I hope we don't go there because I mention them only as a foundation for the issue that I really wanted to discuss; What is the reason for the militant rage currently being exhibited from the Left?  I have pondered this question for quite some time now and have some hypotheses.  The Democratic party of Jimmy Carter (whom I admire and respect greatly) would hide in shame at the antics of today's Democratic party.  While this may be oversimplistic, I do see at least three striking contrasts in the Democratic party of the 70's and that same party of today.  1. Today's Democratic party has embraced a number of 70's fringe groups whose main-stream members exhibited rage, hate and intolerance back in the 70's when the Democratic party did not exhibit those properties.  The groups that come to mind are the National Organization of Women, and a plethora of pro-choice, homosexual and atheist groups.  Back in the 70's, the rank and file of all of these groups exhibited the rage and hate that we see in main-stream Democratic leadership today.  My speculation is that after incorporating these groups, their attitudes have simply 'rubbed off' on the Democrats.  2. Since the 70's, the Democratic party has incorporated socialism into it's worldview.  While this may seem innocent enough on the surface, this necessitates the reconcilitation of something that is irreconcilable; the fact that socialism is diametrically opposed to the principles that the Founders fought for, that the Framers designed for and that has been embraced by this country for all of it's history.  Socialism is so irreconcilable to the beliefs of our Founding Fathers, that (to my knowledge), not one within the ranks of the Democratic leadership has attempted to spin a harmony between themselves and the principles held by the Founders.  (As a libertarian I do believe the Republicans are not far behind the Democrats in their opposition to the Founders.)  3. God.  Not Christianity, but God.  To deny the religious tradition of this country is to revise history.  The Supreme Court was so keenly aware of this fact that when they removed prayer from schools in the early 60's, they did not cite even one precedent (they're weren't any).  When that decision was handed down, Democrats were just as outraged as Republicans; but no more.  It took 25 years, but by the mid-80s the Democratic party had adopted into it's party platform opposition to any reference to God at any event or location that received public funding.  In the decade that followed, we have seen support by the Democratic party for groups that oppose religious activity in non-funded government settings; students reading the Bible silently while on the school bus or before class, school Bible clubs, prayer events in public parks, etc...  Since time the Democratic party is arguably becoming full fledged anti-God.  Consider the article by Robert Reich entitled, "Bush's God", in the June issue of The American Prospect.  You may recall that Reich was a member of President Clinton's cabnet and is commonly appealed to by Democrats as an expert on contemporary social issues.  I have transcribed the final paragraph of Reich's article below.  "The great conflict of the 21st century will not be between the West and terrorism. Terrorism is a tactic, not a belief. The true battle will be between modern civilization and anti-modernists; between those who believe in the primacy of the individual and those who believe that human beings owe their allegiance and identity to a higher authority; between those who give priority to life in this world and those who believe that human life is mere preparation for an existence beyond life; between those who believe in science, reason, and logic and those who believe that truth is revealed through Scripture and religious dogma. Terrorism will disrupt and destroy lives. But terrorism itself is not the greatest danger we face."  While in this article Reich makes some very good observations, in this paragraph he demonstrates that he has a very weak understanding of faith.  That aside, to Reich, the faith held by the Founders, Framers and overwhelming majority of Americans in the almost 230 years since the signing of the Declaration of Independence is a greater threat than militant Islamists like the ones that attacked on September 11, 2001.  While I seriously doubt that Reich's view on the subject are main-stream within the Democratic rank and file, it will be interesting to see if he is shouted down by any of the current Democratic leadership.  I fear that will not happen.  I think that this third plank I have listed is the biggest reason for the hatred we see from the Democratic leadership for President Bush.  It can't be said that Bush is hated for the Iraq war or anything that he has done while in office; for the simple reason that he was openly hated by the Left before he took office.  As one who will not be voting for President Bush in November, it has been a comical exercise to watch him implement liberal legislation time and time again while the Democrats vote against him (good for them) and continue to hate him while he is implementing what they've been wanting to implement all along.  Most notably, protectionism, dropping millions more poor from the tax roles, making it more difficult for the rich to file bankruptcy, implementing the largest entitlement program since the Great Society; and the list of liberal legislation that Bush has backed goes on and on and on and on and on etc...  (It has been just as comical to watch the Republicans support President Bush's liberal policies that they would have screamed bloody murder over had a Democratic president proposed them.)  Even though Bush has moved the Republican party to the left by leaps and bounds, he is still hated by the Left.  While every US president without exception has professed a belief in God, an and since the 20th century only a few have worn it on their sleeves; the only one in my lifetime being President Bush (W).  Will this alone ensure hatred of him by the Democratic leadership and liberal elite?

      What will the Bush Administration try to pull next?  According to  urlLink this  article, MSNBC sources claim that there might be an effort to 'delay' the federal elections this fall due to 'security' concerns.  This  cannot  be allowed to be seriously considered, let alone done.  We need to rise up now and ensure this doesn't happen.  Knowing the average person, however, they will continue muddling along, either ignorant of this possibility, or dismissing it out of hand.  Only a fool takes their liberty for granted.

This weekend the father's-day gift my daughters bought me finally arrived; my  urlLink Stauer reproduction 1922 watch.

What time is it?"  Smart-asses.  ------------------  Remember when cartoons were cartoons?  Pow Wow the Indian Boy? Clutch Cargo?  Crusader Rabbit? Clyde Crashcup? Roger Ramjet? Huckleberry Hound?

      &nbsp; Taxation, by definition, is the forcible expropriation of private property by government for the purpose of financing the activities of government.&nbsp; One of the key principles of the American founding, perhaps the key principle in fact, was the idea of private property rights. America’s strength is built upon its wealth and that wealth was generated not by government but by individuals pursuing their own economic self interest.&nbsp; Our government cannot in fact, create wealth.&nbsp; It can only consume it or redirect its use.   Now it’s undeniable that this forced expropriation of private property is necessary for the proper functioning of government.&nbsp; There exists no other way for government to generate the revenues required if it is to carry out it’s constitutionally and legislatively assigned duties.&nbsp; We must however attempt to balance government’s need for working capital against the needs of the private sector and the rights of individuals to be secure in their property.&nbsp; Take too much and economic growth is severely hampered, take too little and government is rendered ineffectual. So how do we find a reasonable balance between the two?   A good place to start would probably be by defining what exactly government should and shouldn’t be spending money on.&nbsp; In my view government has two legitimate arguments for spending.&nbsp; Government may spend on those things mandated by the Constitution obviously but there is also a not so obvious justification to be found in the idea of the political contract.&nbsp; The political contract can best be viewed as a mandate from the people for government action.&nbsp; Sometimes it’s short term, other times it is an enduring expectation. Franklyn Roosevelt’s New Deal was an example of extra-constitutional action by government being justified by the political contract. While it can be easily argued that F.D.R.s New Deal actually prolonged the Great Depression it’s also inarguable that it also alleviated to some extent the suffering of the American people while the economy recovered.&nbsp; It staved off famine and other negative effects associated with extreme economic depravation.&nbsp; If no action had been taken it is entirely likely that the American society and our form of government would have been disrupted or even collapsed.&nbsp; In that light, while unconstitutional, the New Deal was definitely justified by the political contract between government and the people.&nbsp; Realistically speaking though, the political contract only provides justification for government spending in the most extreme circumstances and that spending should not continue beyond the end of the circumstance that demanded it.  So we see that, except in times of extreme duress, our government must limit it’s spending to those things that are required of it constitutionally and legislatively.&nbsp; Even at that government spending has the potential to be enormous.&nbsp; Even mandated functions of government should have to face a cost benefit analysis.&nbsp; Government must maintain a military and police force to protect our nation and our citizens from violent outside influences but that does not give them carte blance for unlimited spending.&nbsp; This is true for all mandated government actions.&nbsp; We have to identify just exactly what level of action and thus spending that government should undertake in each of it’s required activities.&nbsp; For instance for generations the mandate for military preparedness has been considered adequately met as long as the US is capable of carrying on a war on two fronts.&nbsp; This same sort of goal setting must be applied to all of the mandated activities of government.  No matter what though, we must always keep in mind that government is not spending it’s own money.&nbsp; It’s taking it away from its rightful owners so as to fulfill its role in our society.&nbsp; While that’s an inevitable and necessary evil it’s still an evil by the standards we have chosen to live by.&nbsp; In that light governmental activity and the expropriations that it necessitates must be seriously considered before it occurs and re-evaluated often.&nbsp; It’s important to always remember that for government to take any action it must first forcibly seize the means of paying for it from it’s citizens.&nbsp; No one that believes in private property can be comfortable with that.

      As we wind up and get ready for the 2-2 pitch, just over 100 days from the election and the heart of the batting order coming up to the plate...    I thought this might be an appropriate time to set out to the Team and our visitors (and I would like to point out that we have had some visitors whose names everyone would know - but more about that some other time) what should be considered "The Ideal" in terms of our use of this forum.  The picture on the left there is of John Kenneth Galbraith, paragon of liberal economic theology and virtual godhead of an entire generation of the "Left." He is included here as someone with whom many people agree and many others disagree but who nonetheless is deserving of our collective respect for a good many reasons.  The same reasons we would - or should - have for this fellow on the right   by the name of William F. Buckley. Paragon of conservative theology and virtual godhead of an entire generation of the "Right."  I bring these two images to you all in the hopes that we can all emulate them as models in this setting.   There is hardly any reason to suspect these two could find all that much to agree about politically or economically or philosophically or maybe even about baseball. But what they hold in common is a kind regard for each other - oft stated publically - and the capability to engage in the kind of self-depricating humor that would difuse otherwise heated situations and even-out the temperature. In short, both of these men are giants who could keep everything else in proportion.  I charge the membership here to understand one thing; if these two men - being giants - could find enough humor in the human condition to hold their deeply-held personal beliefs in abeyance relative to demonstrating mutual respect to one another - little folk like us should be able to do the same.  All that said - I really miss Buckley's  Firing Line , because for all the high-falutin' heaviness and depth of import, I always enjoyed Buckley's jabs at George McGovern's loss of hair, and the following retorts regarding Buckley's hunger for pencil tips, and the fact that the laughter this created was genuine and shared by friends.  That's my ideal for the Yard.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four hundred and 87 years ago a simple monk by the name of  urlLink Martin Luther  became one of the most talked about individuals in all of Europe.&nbsp; He did this by challenging first the divine right of kings and then by challenging the very Church that created those kings.&nbsp; With the writing of  urlLink Secular Authority  Luther set in motion events that would forever change the world.&nbsp; He claimed, convincingly, that secular government has no right to dictate the beliefs of those it leads.&nbsp; Moreover, in his challenge to the Church he taught men that they could interpret God’s will for themselves, that no man, be he priest, king or pauper had the right or ability to command the beliefs of another.&nbsp; He set the wheels in motion.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three hundred and 44 years ago  urlLink Thomas Hobbes  wrote, “…life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish and short.”&nbsp; His point was that man needs society to survive with any modicum of dignity, comfort or safety.&nbsp; He believed fully that government was so important that the nature of that government did not matter.&nbsp; Be it democracy or tyranny, communist, capitalist or some bizarre meld of the two, it was better than living in constant fear for your life in the state of nature.&nbsp; He called the state of nature a state of war, in which each man had a perfect right to everything, but only if he could defend that right against others.&nbsp; There was no morality in the state of nature and that must have horrified Hobbes.&nbsp; After all, he lived in a time where God still walked the Earth, or so it seemed, but he kept the ball in motion.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirty years later  urlLink John Locke  made it clear that while he agreed with Hobbes that the state of nature was to be avoided that the nature of government was critical as well.&nbsp; After all, if it is important to gather together in society to avoid the ravages of our neighbors it does not good to do so under a government that will ravage us instead.&nbsp; Locke argued that the purpose of government was to enforce contracts and defend property rights while protecting its citizens from undo outside aggressions.&nbsp; He believed that government, to be legitimate, had to have limited power to act within the country while having an unlimited reach without.&nbsp; Some claim Locke and Hobbes were at odds, they were not.&nbsp; They were two faces of the same coin.&nbsp; Both extolled the merits of government and society, they differed only on the power that government should have over its subjects.&nbsp; Still and all, their dialog kept things moving along nicely.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One hundred and 16 years after Hobbes wrote his  urlLink Leviathan  and 86 years after Locke had responded with  urlLink The Second Treatise on Government  something almost magical happened.&nbsp; Luther, Hobbes and Locke were long dead, as were all those who came before them shaping and guiding their thinking on the role of man in society but their words, their philosophies lived on and rather suddenly caught fire.&nbsp;  urlLink Adam Smith  wrote of his “invisible hand” at this time.&nbsp; He said, and many believe to this day, that the market should be allowed to control the flow of most, if not all, goods and services within society. &nbsp;He taught that government intervention in the market was an unnatural influence that could only disrupt and weaken the relationship not only between buyer and seller but also between men.&nbsp; Once the power of government is brought to bear to give advantage to one side or the other within the contract commerce becomes impossible.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That very same year something amazing happened.&nbsp; Other words were penned that year, and those words shook the very foundations of the known world.&nbsp; You see  urlLink Thomas Jefferson  penned the  urlLink Declaration of Independence  that same year.&nbsp; His words challenged everything that the old world was based upon and declared that a new nation, in which government is not above the law, in which government served the people, was aborning.&nbsp; A new day was dawning and it brought political and personal freedom, something the common man had never seen before in any other place.&nbsp; From that seed grew a nation based upon an ideal of limited government and an empowered populace.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today we throw all of that away.&nbsp; In our ignorance of the past, of its legacy to us, we fail to recognize the import and value of our Constitution and our form of government.&nbsp; To this day it exists only here.&nbsp; No one else has the protections and freedoms we enjoy.&nbsp; No one else enjoys the opportunities or faces the challenges as freely as we do here. So why do we not care?&nbsp; Why do we fail to fulfill our duty to our ancestors, our progeny and ourselves?&nbsp; We no longer know the history, the philosophy and the suffering that made this nation, this one nation under God, not only possible but inevitable.&nbsp; In our ignorance and our pride we may well make it’s fall inevitable as well.&nbsp;

      The extent of our military might is so obvious a fact, that it need not be re-emphasized.&nbsp;America is often&nbsp;referred to us as "The American Empire" -a&nbsp;metaphor which deserves neither nationalistic embrace, nor rejection by denial. Rather, we are warranted to&nbsp;draw historical parallels&nbsp;with the fallen empires&nbsp;of past, and&nbsp;the Pax Americana of today.   America's&nbsp;current situation&nbsp;is&nbsp;most commonly&nbsp;paralleled to&nbsp;that of the&nbsp;Roman empire. However, the parallel is insufficient. The Roman empire was built by legions who slaughtered their way to world power. In the process, they suffered catastrophic defeats at the hands of the Gauls, Persians, Carthaginians, and numerous other Germanic tribes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The grand legions fell in clashes with rival dictators, and massive revolts the&nbsp;humiliated citizens of their occupations. The United States hasn't suffered comparable defeats since the Korean War.&nbsp;It also bears&nbsp;mentioning that the&nbsp;Legions owned their allegiance, not to Rome or the Emperor, but to their leaders and fellow troops. Thus, while Rome did dominate the world, it did so without the military superiority or discipline&nbsp;of the&nbsp;United States&nbsp;at present.   The other common parallel is that of the British Empire during the late 19th century. Unlike the Romans, the British&nbsp;had a&nbsp;relatively small army. Bismarck once joked that if the British&nbsp;army landed on the Baltic coast, he'd send the Berlin Police to arrest them. The British Empire was mostly sustained by their legendary navy. However,&nbsp;the huge mass of ships in the royal navy&nbsp;became increasingly&nbsp; obsolete. The Ironclad was introduced into the French Navy well before the British caught up. Even when the British introduced the revolutionary Dreadnought battleships, the superior industrial power of the Americans and Germans closed the&nbsp;gap&nbsp;of sea power within&nbsp;a blink of an eye.   Historically, the strength of the United States military is without parallel. Our military budget accounts for 50% of the overall international expenditures on defense.&nbsp;Within the annals of military history, the US is the only country to enjoy superiority in all spheres of warfare (land, sea, air, and space).&nbsp;No other country's military can compare to our technological sophistication. Not a single country can compete with the US's capability to&nbsp;move large forces&nbsp;within short periods of time to any part of the globe. In short, the legions of the United States have no match, and the gap between them and other militarize is only growing.   Perhaps the biggest military blunder in recent history was Vietnam. However, the damage of Vietnam is not comparable to that of Disraeli's regiments at Isandhlwana, or Augustus's legions in the Teutoburger Wald. In the end, its not the terminology of "Empire" that matters; rather its America's overwhelming military dominance. For now, no international coalition could be capable of blocking it, let alone willing to replace it. Our strength lies in our remarkably stable economy and political system, and our growing and extraordinarily productive workforce. The fact is that no president will call for a major reduction in defense spending in the next decade or deny that&nbsp;we must&nbsp;have the strongest military in&nbsp;the world, ready to exert its power&nbsp;at any point the world&nbsp;unilaterally.   The United States has much less choice in world affairs than the pacifists or foreign critics would like to believe. Despite the wishes of the French, no coalition is likely to form that will counter-weight US strength and restore a military balance similar to post-Napoleonic Europe.&nbsp;Contrary to the wishes of&nbsp;idealists, the UN&nbsp;has proven&nbsp;incapable of maintaining global order without the military, diplomatic,&nbsp;and financial support of the&nbsp;US.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, if the pacifists had their way, and we became isolationists with a mediocre military -the result would be International anarchy, rampant totalitarianism, and&nbsp;mass-bloodshed -all of which is too horrifying to contemplate.   In the end, our real choice is&nbsp;to exercise our power foolishly or prudently, safely or dangerously. In the case of Iraq, we excercised our power foolishly and dangerously.&nbsp;Our military is a&nbsp;mighty machine, but even now is showing signs of fatigue and ware. Had we not invaded Iraq, we would have ended a genocide in Sudan by now- which&nbsp;would have been an&nbsp;example of wise use of military force. However, we've over-stretched ourselves in Iraq and Afghanistan, and our European allies have shown complete denial and apathy towards the situation. If anything is clear regarding the future international order, its that Europe will continue to behave much as they did at the Munich Conference of 1938, and delude themselves into thinking that&nbsp;the temporary lack of war&nbsp;is peace. As for America, it rests in the hands of the people to elect a president who will continue to make the world safer. Judging from Bush's first term, he will not be that man.&nbsp;

      Way down on the lower right hand side of the right hand side bar (to the right), you will find a picture of my grand-daughter Emma, who will be 1 years old next month. She is half American and half Scot and I think that gives her dual citizenship or something but I don't care.  Her little icon is there to remind everyone to behave and mind your Ps and Qs.   I think we have put together quite an interesting group (where the hell did Cygnus go??), and I am told we will have more visits from jss when he takes a break from med school.  In the meantime I thought our regulars should know we have reached a point where we are getting 100 unique visits a day - and that's pretty astonishing for a blog Emma is 8 months older than.   Well done, everybody!

      Trish has (below) provided us with a link to the final "Report" of the 9/11 Commission and applies her own take on the findings.  Now that I have stopped laughing at her well-aimed sarcasm I think I have come to understand what the Commission wants to do. According to that CNN link, the three major actions will be...  1. Establish a Cabinet-level intelligence director. 2. Establish a single counterterrorism center. 3. Create a single, joint congressional committee to oversee homeland security.  So knowing government as we do, we can say that the plan, in other words, is;   1. Increase the size of government.  2. Make a new level of bureaucracy, 3. And make sure we give the Congress part of the all the new money this is going to cost.  Oh and as a BTW...  To add to this - we've seen the tapes today of some of the hijackers walking through the security system the day of the attacks on America.  That damn President Bush! Why didn't he stop them!

      Way back in the heady days of the mid-term elections of 1998, I made my first serious foray into the political world.&nbsp; I volunteered on the senate campaign of Bert Loftman, an Atlanta neurosurgeon, running on the Libertarian Ticket against incumbent Republican Paul Coverdale and Great American Cookie Company founder and Democratic candidate Michael Coles.  &nbsp;  I won't bore you with the details.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that a college student with too much time/energy on his hands for his own good (this was the only summer I didn't take classes) willing to volunteer on a lost-cause third-party campaign can quickly become a member of the "inner circle".&nbsp; Mainly because there was just one circle.&nbsp; I think my title ended up being "media coordinator" or something.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The election night gathering of the Georgia Libertarians was fun...the atmosphere was light, as no one actually expected to win.&nbsp; The pressure was off.&nbsp; We watched the returns; we cheered for 3%.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  But the eye-opening moment occurred when the divide between the "Atlanta" Libertarians and the "Georgia" Libertarians became painfully apparent.&nbsp; The candidate for some office...I think it was Attorney General...screened his TV spot.&nbsp; There he was, in his suit, tie, beard, and mullet, standing in front of a bookcase filled with law books, holding a rifle big enough to put down an elephant.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I don't remember what he  said , but that's not really the point.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Now, I don't want to get into the merits of the Second Amendment (of which I am a big fan, BTW), but one has to admit that the image the gentleman projected was probably not the best way to win over your typical swing voter.&nbsp; I'd only been a "media coordinator" for three months, and I could figure as much out.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Murmurs circulated around the room.&nbsp; Some thought the spot was fantastic.&nbsp; The rest of us were horrified.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I have since made it a point to identify myself as a "libertarian with a little 'l'"--which isn't to say I haven't supported Libertarian candidates, but I don't feel that the Party is where my energy is best directed.&nbsp; There are, of course,  urlLink other   urlLink examples  of folks who haven't exactly raised the credibility of the party that is already viewed my many (most?) voters as "fringe".&nbsp;  &nbsp;  And so we come to 2004.&nbsp; A year in which we have a presidential candidate who is clearly in favor of big government, orgiastic federal spending, massive entitlement programs,&nbsp;and nanny-state-ism of the most obnoxious kind.&nbsp; And then there's John Kerry, who has problems of his own.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  That, and we seem to be heading in an aggressive&nbsp;foreign policy direction that is perhaps the biggest departure from the founding principles of this nation since slavery was an acceptable practice.&nbsp; But let's not even get into that.&nbsp; (Really, let's not.)&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  My point is, if ever there was a time for the LP to present itself as the rational, viable alternative to the  status quo  of American politics, as the party of liberty, peace, and prosperity, as the party that&nbsp;thinks the greatest threat to American society is neither gay people getting married nor wealthy people actually keeping the money they earn,   this is it!    &nbsp;  So what does the LP do?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  They nominate a guy who  urlLink hasn't filed tax returns in a while (and is quite proud of it), doesn't have a driver's license (but reportedly drives), and has talked about blowing up the UN and confining prisoners to bed so that their muscles atrophy .  &nbsp;  Great.&nbsp; Job.&nbsp; Guys.&nbsp;   (cross-posted at  urlLink Uncle Brian's Rant )

      I know more than a few readers will wonder what  urlLink this  might be doing on this here, but if you read our  Who We Are / How It Works  on the sidebar to the right, you'll note that it includes "To let opposing views stand in counter-point, and then go on our merry way..."    To many, political or sexual satire is in poor taste, but both at the same time may be too much.  Be forewarned, take your heart medication before viewing...and then have a smile or two.

      Here's a lesson in how meaningless party labels are these days, and how if you think there is a vast sea of philosophical difference between Republicans and Democrats you may be fooling yourself.  When the primaries were over this spring  urlLink Jack Ryan  emerged as the Republican nominee for Senate, and then little by little his position eroded. First divorce records were released and then the specifics of his sexual predilections were open for all to see. Without going into the details, lets just say he was interested in having sex with his wife - but his wife didn't have a lot of affinity for the real estate involved. Location location location.  So out he goes.  It would make sense if the Republicans went down the list and went to the candidate that finished second in the primary, get behind him and get the campaign going. You would think that would make sense. Except they first entertained the notion of putting  urlLink Mike Ditka  up. This would have been fun for about a week, and then it would have stopped being fun. And then the Democrats would win the seat and the Republicans would have been entertaining but they wouldn't have to worry about an outsider taking hold of their party.  And that, you see, is what it is all about when all is said and done.   They haven't moved down to the second place finisher - and won't - because  urlLink Jim Oberweis  is simply not one of the insiders in the Illinois Republican party.  You will hear he frightened people with his anti-immigration talk and that he has no experience and so forth - but the real reason the party won't move him to the front is they don't need an outsider threatening their hold on the party reigns. Party ownership - not issues or a senate seat - is what this is about.  And holding those reigns in the State Treasurer - the highest elected Republican in the state, Judy Barr Topinka, who (like party bosses all over the country have done and will do from either side of the aisle as long as the two majors hold sway in this country)  would rather lose this election than raise an outsider up in the party ranks to threaten her own power.   Judy Barr Topinka - the head of the "conservative" Republican party that will lose Illinois for their President in no small way probably because of  urlLink stunts like this one.     How exactly does one reconcile that with the national party's stance? I don't know... maybe ask good buddies of the President like  urlLink Arlen Specter  how these things happen.  Or - for anyone in Illinois who needs further proof how conservative insurgents not of the rank and file or near the leadership decision-makers of the party will fare - ask if anybody remembers anti-abortion, anti-gun control, anti-tax, not-one-of-the-party-leaders, won-the-primary-grass-roots-style, got-abandoned-by-the-party-bosses candidate from the 90s by the name of  urlLink Al Salvi.   He could tell you what Illinois's "conservatives" are all about...

      Its Saturday night. This crew has spent the last few months hammering away at issues other blogs rarely get to. This is not, as you can see, one of those self-centered, mindless blogs that talk about hair cuts and the girl down the street and comparative beer (though we should do that one some time).  I don't know about other blogs and other teams -  urlLink but here's how we kick back.   Cheers!

      George Orwell once wrote that a political writer shouldn't use a metaphor, simile, or figure of speech, unless it has never been seen in print. Thus, I won't say Kerry "hit a home run" or "struck out". If I had to put Kerry's performance at the convention into the metaphor of baseball, I'd first of all say that Kerry was the pitcher. Indeed, his speech did close another inning without the Republicans being able to score a run. However, the Republicans have been hitting quite well this game and Kerry hasn't gotten a single strike out. So far, the Republican line-up has simply had an unlucky streak of hitting fly balls into the gloves the Democrat's outfielders.   It's only the bottom of the 5th inning and the score remains 0-0. To say the obvious, this game is far from over. I'd bet money that this game is going to go into extra innings. However, lets hope that there won't be too many extra innings, like there were in 2000.

      It never ceases to amaze me how people can be so quick to judge others, to make huge assumptions and leaps in logic, and even later after others bring to their attention some holes in their theories, continue to defend to the death their points of view... Annie Jacobsen, for those that don't know, is a woman who flew on a plane recently whose fellow passengers included some Arabic men that scared her by their behavior.  That's gross oversimplification, but that's how Annie herself might sum it up in a nutshell.  She claims ethnic/racial appearances had nothing to do with it.  Somehow, I highly doubt that.  But the point is, as the writer of  urlLink this  article explain so well, the result of her publicizing her perceptions of that flight, it has went towards heightening negative relations between peoples, and not helped at all in making anything better...the story is still awash with mystery, no government agency or spokesman clarifying the lose ends...it is a "...hailstorm of rumor and rampant speculation."

      Here's where we begin the campaign season in earnest.   I am going to re-start a series I used to do at another venue long ago with the sole purpose of publishing, side-by-side, items of interest that seek to expose the manipulation we are under from people with a vested interest in us not fully grasping the actualities.  The idea is to present one from column A and one from column B, sometimes related and sometimes not, but equal parts political dirty trick or character assassination or misrepresentations... you know... harmless little murders in the name of the public interest.  Tonite's first entry concerns two "agent provacateurs" acting in behalf of their "team", Michael Moore on the Left vs the Club For Growth on the Right.    urlLink Moore's mendacity confirmed    EXCERPT:  "In an article posted on his website on July 23, Michael Moore misconstrues the 9/11 Commission report, suggesting it supports two claims made in "Fahrenheit 9/11" when it actually sheds doubt on them."  ----  urlLink  Club for Growth PAC ad recycles misleading tax claims   EXCERPT:  "A Club for Growth PAC TV ad released July 26 accurately cites Kerry's changing positions over the years on welfare reform, the death penalty for terrorists, and gasoline taxes.   "But it also falsely implies that he's voted to raise taxes 350 times, a claim we've de-bunked before."   ----  This is merely the first of a series. You are welcomed to add your own here. Please post them in pairs.  I'm sure there's enough to go around... and you will find the exercise quite liberating!

      Galt recently wrote a rather convincing post which was in favor of deficit spending. He asserted:    Deficits don’t matter. That is a statement of rock solid, unchallengeable truth and I will endeavor to prove this over the course of this writing.    Galt supports that bold claim quite well. However, I think he was as wrong as our government's method of measuring deficits.   The typical criticism of deficit spending is as follows: Deficits let current generations off the hook for paying the bills. Thus, consumption rises while rate of savings and investment declines. This leads to there being less capital per worker, and therefore lower growth in productivity. Since capital&nbsp;is scarce, the rate of return rises, which leads to a rise in&nbsp;interest rates. These high interest rates attract foreign investors which, by definition, cause our trade deficit to widen.  However, there has been almost no correlation between&nbsp;the budget deficit and the interest rate, productivity growth rate, or the&nbsp;savings and investment rate. Some economists, such as Robert Barro of Harvard (and Galt) see this as absolute proof that deficits don't matter. To them, the&nbsp;typical criticism of deficits is nothing more than a scary story to tell in the dark.   If only it were just a "story". Like economists&nbsp;Robert Eisner and Michael Boskin (chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers under George H. W. Bush),&nbsp;I believe&nbsp;that&nbsp;correlation between the deficit and other economic variables is so low because the deficit has been defined incorrectly. The official debt is only a&nbsp;measure&nbsp;of our government's&nbsp;liabilities; it completely ignores our assets. In layman's terms, its akin to calling the owner of a $1 million property a debtor,&nbsp;by mere account of his&nbsp;large mortgage.   There are fierce arguments amongst academia and government officials on how to measure our debt. Those are beyond the scope of this post, but we can conclude:    The deficit is not a well-defined economic concept     &nbsp;  The real problems with deficit spending are not measured by our current&nbsp;federal deficit figure. Most notably, we should be worrying about transfers of wealth between generations (or maybe just me, since I'm 22 I have a self interest in not paying y'alls bills).&nbsp;This point is&nbsp;best illustrated in&nbsp; urlLink Franco Modigliani's life-cycle model,  which won him&nbsp;a Nobel prize in 1985.&nbsp;According to his model, a policy which&nbsp;redistributes wealth&nbsp;from young to the old&nbsp;will cause&nbsp;an increase in&nbsp;national consumption and a decline in national savings.&nbsp;This is because older people have larger propensities to consume than younger people. Since they are closer to the end of their lives,&nbsp;they have a tendency to spend their remaining resources&nbsp;more quickly. The bumper sticker in Florida which reads "I'm spending my kids inheritance" sums it up best.   In short, transferring wealth from younger to older generations causes a rise consumption, trade-deficits, and interest rates, while lowering savings&nbsp;and investments. In other words, everything bad that is associated with deficit spending. Our current measure of the deficit does not take generational transfers into account.   Neoclassical economics offers an alternative to our shaky deficit measure:  urlLink generational accounts . Generational accounts measure what a member of a generation will pay the government minus benefits from the government. The burden on future generations is measured using the "intertemporal budget constraint." The constraint states that government spending on cannot exceed the sum of three items:  1. The government's net wealth.  2. The present value of net payments to the government by current generations.  3. The present value of net payments by future generations.   An analysis of&nbsp;our current spending&nbsp;using generational models indicates that the U.S. economic policy is&nbsp;extremely out of balance. (y'all are going to love this) Its not difficult to find the perpetrators, they are the pay-as-you-go programs: Social Security, civil service, and military retirement programs. These programs are not measured by our deficit, because&nbsp;again they are&nbsp;"pay as you go".&nbsp;   Within the next few years, 77 million baby boomers are going to start collecting Social Security. By the year 2030, the United States will have doubled the number of elderly,&nbsp;but there will&nbsp;only&nbsp;be 18 percent more workers to pay for their benefits.&nbsp;Do the math. The budget shortfall amounts to roughly $45 trillion. That figure is twelve times larger than the official debt.    urlLink Will it be possible to pay for social security? &nbsp;If we started today, paying the bill would require one of four options from "the menu of pain":  1. A raise in income taxes (individual and corporate) by 69 percent.  2. A raise in payroll taxes by 95 percent.  3. We could cut Social Security and Medicare benefits by 56 percent.  4. We could cut federal discretionary spending by more than 100 percent.   The Bush Administration's approach to this impending disaster was what Bush Sr. called "voodoo economics". With an impending fiscal crisis on the horizon, they passed not one, but three tax cuts; if a boat is sinking, why not punch a bigger whole in it and get it over with? In the real world, taxes raise consumption, lower savings. etc. Some might argue that some of the cuts, like dividend taxes, will give people an incentive to save. However, in the real world economics, that's neither&nbsp;how people behave,&nbsp;nor are predicted to behave.&nbsp;One gets a clearer picture why Bush is often seen as fiscally insane.   Our government will be unable to pay entitlements without taxing my generation to death. At the same time,&nbsp; there will be powerful coalitions who wish to defend their entitlements. Simply pretending that this crisis will work itself out will not make it go away. The fact is that most people receiving social security checks during retirement are not exactly going to complain. Even y'all libertarians may disapprove of social security in principle, but I also know that you wouldn't mind the government giving you back your money. Unfortunately, it will be my money which the government gives you. And there is probably going to be a rather pronounced&nbsp;political war&nbsp;between generations in the coming years. So excuse me when I disagree about deficits not mattering. I'll be paying your entitlements.

       urlLink Why Socialist Don't Believe in Fun   (1943 *  )   By George Orwell   Utopias (incidentally the coined word Utopia doesn't mean 'a good place', it means merely a 'non-existent place') have been common in literature of the past three or four hundred years but the 'favourable' ones are invariably unappetising, and usually lacking in vitality as well...   By far the best known modern Utopias are those of H.G. Wells. Wells's vision of the future is almost fully expressed in two books written in the early Twenties, The Dream and Men Like Gods. Here you have a picture of the world as Wells would like to see it or thinks he would like to see it. It is a world whose keynotes are enlightened hedonism and scientific curiosity. All the evils and miseries we now suffer from have vanished. Ignorance, war, poverty, dirt, disease, frustration, hunger, fear, overwork, superstition all vanished. So expressed, it is impossible to deny that that is the kind of world we all hope for.   We all want to abolish the things Wells wants to abolish. But is there anyone who actually wants to live in a Wellsian Utopia? On the contrary, not to live in a world like that, not to wake up in a hygenic garden suburb infested by naked schoolmarms, has actually become a conscious political motive. A book like Brave New World is an expression of the actual fear that modern man feels of the rationalised hedonistic society which it is within his power to create. A Catholic writer said recently that Utopias are now technically feasible and that in consequence how to avoid Utopia had become a serious problem. We cannot write this off as merely a silly remark. For one of the sources of the Fascist movement is the desire to avoid a too -rational and too-comfortable world.   All 'favourable' Utopias seem to be alike in postulating perfection while being unable to suggest happiness. Attempts at describing a definitely other-worldly happiness have been no more successful. Heaven is as great a flop as Utopia though Hell occupies a respectable place in literature, and has often been described most minutely and convincingly.   It is a commonplace that the Christian Heaven, as usually portrayed, would attract nobody. Almost all Christian writers dealing with Heaven either say frankly that it is indescribable or conjure up a vague picture of gold, precious stones, and the endless singing of hymns. This has, it is true, inspired some of the best poems in the world: Thy walls are of chalcedony, Thy bulwarks diamonds square, Thy gates are of right orient pearl Exceeding rich and rare! But what it could not do was to describe a condition in which the ordinary human being actively wanted to be.   Many a revivalist minister, many a Jesuit priest (see, for instance, the terrific sermon in James Joyce's Portrait of the Artist) has frightened his congregation almost out of their skins with his word-pictures of Hell. But as soon as it comes to Heaven, there is a prompt falling-back on words like 'ecstasy' and 'bliss', with little attempt to say what they consist in. Perhaps the most vital bit of writing on this subject is the famous passage in which Tertullian explains that one of the chief joys of Heaven is watching the tortures of the damned.   As for the Muslim Paradise, with its 77 houris per man, all presumably clamouring for attention at the same moment, it is just a nightmare. Nor are the spiritualists, though constantly assuring us that 'all is bright and beautiful', able to describe any next-world activity which a thinking person would find endurable, let alone attractive.   It is the same with attempted descriptions of perfect happiness which are neither Utopian nor other-worldly, but merely sensual. They always give an impression of emptiness or vulgarity, or both. At the beginning of La Pucelle Voltaire describes the life of Charles IX with his mistress, Agnes Sorel. They were 'always happy', he says. And what did their happiness consist in? An endless round of feasting, drinking, hunting and love-making. Who would not sicken of such an existence after a few weeks?    It would seem that human beings are not able to describe, nor perhaps to imagine, happiness except in terms of contrast.  That is why the conception of Heaven or Utopia varies from age to age. In pre-industrial society Heaven was described as a place of endless rest, and as being paved with gold, because the experience of the average human being was overwork and poverty.    * The rest of the edited (short attention span) version&nbsp;can be&nbsp;found at   urlLink  Net Politik.    &nbsp;Or    urlLink Follow this link  if you want to read the original.

      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes the conventional wisdom is a lie.&nbsp; Not always, but often enough that it pays to challenge the conventional wisdom and instead look at the facts and draw our own conclusion.&nbsp; Tax deficits for example.&nbsp; Someone recently commented on the political hay that Democrats could make out of  urlLink Vice President Dick Cheney’s  alleged assertion that “deficits don’t matter.”&nbsp; Now it matters not a whit if Mr. Cheney actually made this statement or not for the purposes of this discussion.&nbsp; Personally I hope that he did because it would mean that he was asserting a bold truth in the face of a conventional wisdom that is clearly a lie.&nbsp; Deficits don’t matter.&nbsp; That is a statement of rock solid, unchallengeable truth and I will endeavor to prove this over the course of this writing.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A deficit is defined as  urlLink “the amount by which outlays exceed revenues in a given period, typically a fiscal year. A negative deficit is equivalent to a surplus.” &nbsp; It’s appears to be a fairly simple statement.&nbsp; If you spend more than you take in you have a deficit, right?&nbsp; Moreover, since deficit spending isn’t really possible the money to pay for these ‘overdrafts’ has to come from somewhere.&nbsp; If government doesn’t have the revenue stream or the savings to pay for it’s over spending it would seem reasonable then that it must borrow money to pay for it’s expected expenditures.&nbsp; If they have $100.00 in revenue but $150.00 in expenses they must borrow the difference causing the Federal Debt to increase.&nbsp; Or so the conventional wisdom goes.&nbsp; In reality the relationship simply doesn’t work that way, in fact the reverse is true. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Government borrows money continuously in the form of US Savings bonds and Treasury bills.&nbsp; Because these items can be purchased at will as investment items by private citizens Government has little control over debt generated in this manner.&nbsp; When the Stock Market is strong Bond sales tend to fall off and the debt falls.&nbsp; The relationship holds in reverse as well with Bond sales soaring when the Stock Market is weak or unstable causing debt to spiral.&nbsp; This means that government has a relatively constant flow of debt-laden currency coming into its coffers.&nbsp; This is the cold hard cash that allows the D.C. crowd to wallow in deficits year in and year out.&nbsp; It also allows them to deal with whatever emergency situations may come up.&nbsp; The first fallacy, that government borrows money to cover its shortfalls, is thusly laid to rest.&nbsp; The debt is not driven by the deficit; the deficit is driven by the debt.&nbsp; The reverse is truth; deficit spending is only possible because the debt already exists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, of course, is not the only source of Federal debt but it does make up the vast majority of the publicly held debt.&nbsp; The  urlLink Tennessee Valley Authority  and the  urlLink Postal Service  also generate some of the publicly held debt, but that amount is inconsequential in comparison to what is generated through the sale of savings bonds and treasury bills.&nbsp; Publicly held debt accounts for 58.12% of the  urlLink Federal debt  at the time of this writing.&nbsp; The balance of the debt is made up of what are known as  urlLink Intergovernmental Holdings .&nbsp; These are debts largely made up of debts between various Federal agencies and Departments.&nbsp; This debt structure is very similar to the idea of lending your spouse $10.00 and then declaring that your household has incurred a $10.00 debt.&nbsp; More accurately it’s like lending your spouse $10.00 and declaring that your household has incurred a $15.00 debt because of the interest you are charging him/her on the loan. This part of the debt truly is meaningless and is more a question of accounting and budgeting than any actual debt.&nbsp; It could be wiped out with an eraser at any time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now we know a dirty little secret, government incurs debt whether it needs cash or not.&nbsp; Not only that but they cannot choose the time of repayment except in very loose terms.&nbsp; They simply cannot repay publicly held debt until the holder of that debt demands payment.&nbsp; This means that government has a constant, largely uncontrolled influx of new debt-laden currency into its coffers.&nbsp; It cannot invest this money in any traditional sense or even just put it in the bank for a rainy day.&nbsp; The Federal Government is barred by law from doing that and with good reason, although we won’t go into that at this time.&nbsp; All of this adds up to a problem.&nbsp; This influx of money cannot be invested or saved in the traditional sense so it must either be spent or allowed to pile up in a huge, and I mean HUGE, vault somewhere.&nbsp; Stockpiling cash is not a good idea.&nbsp; It takes it out of circulation and effectively makes the total economy smaller.&nbsp; Spending it is the only acceptable method of disposing of this windfall because it’s the only way to get it back into public circulation.&nbsp; It can only help to drive the economy if it is dispersed back into the private sector through spending.&nbsp; No one that I know of will ever make the claim that Federal spending does not help drive economic growth.&nbsp; The Keynesian economic models favored by statists everywhere are based primarily upon that very idea.&nbsp; This of course brings us full circle.&nbsp; Deficits don’t matter.&nbsp; They don’t matter because the cash to pay for it has already been borrowed.&nbsp; We could, I suppose, go further and claim, if we were statists, that deficit spending is actually a net benefit and should be encouraged if we are going to continue down this path of uncontrolled borrowing.&nbsp; I’d love to see the Democrats try to make political hay of Cheney’s statement as well.&nbsp; He doesn’t seem the sort to let conventional wisdom stand in the way of truth.

      Those of us who live in Illinois just love it when we're in the news.  Tonite after the final piece on the NBC news show (one of those quickie interview/background bio things on Illinois State Senator Barack Obama), the camera went to Tom Brokaw.   With finger to his lips and eyes squinting as if a cobwebbed recess of his mind has been activated by a fresh possibility, the camera catches him staring at the monitor despite the fact the piece is over. And there he is, the Great Man, gazing at the impression Mr Obama leaves on the screen. He makes his half-smiling nod of approval to the image, changes his attention back to his willing viewers, and signs off for the night. A knowing smile. A friendly salutation. Fade. Oblivion. Run Promo.   Mr Brokaw does that sort of thing I suppose.   It is either  The Nod  or the  Incredulous Stare  at a story so outrageous and sad it is a no-brainer to disapprove of. But always - always - that darn camera catches him before he is ready for us to see him again, showing us those venerable and deep reactions to all sorts of things on the human scene.  That silent reaction he gives. Approval or befuddlement, right along with us (he supposes), perhaps even leading the issue. So momentous. So important. So insightful. So transparent.  An honest effort would be to make an editorial comment. Instead it is as if caught by the camera suddenly thinking for himself. We get a rare glimpse into the thought process of an Important Fellow. And - after all the discord and mayhem of the night - a tacit lesson on how to be and how to feel and what we should feel.   Makes a person think he is casually imagining he is manipulating somebody out there.   Oh well.   Anyway there was Brokaw - the final jewel in State Senator Obama's crown. This party-manufactured media-creation with the  urlLink questionable voting record , unknown before now even by the voters in his own state, who is being coronated by the sycophantic national media (which has a great story to tell and won't be caught dead questioning a young black politician too closely), who is being helped in no small way by the dubious and inept Republicans of the Land of Lincoln  (who don't even have a candidate running against him for US Senator in November)  is the next elected Senator. Ipso hipso blah de facto.  And no one in three counties in any direction from where I sit can exactly tell you what he ever did.  The rising star of the Democrats.   And what about the election in my state? The serious business of deciding who represents the people who have given their consent to be governed?   Put a fork in it - its done.

          Harvey Cox, the professor of divinity at Harvard University, wrote a fantastic essay called  urlLink The Market is God  Here is a teaser:     Expecting a terra incognita, I found myself instead in the land of deja vu. The lexicon of The Wall Street Journal and the business sections of Time and Newsweek turned out to bear a striking resemblance to Genesis, the Epistle to the Romans, and Saint Augustine's City of God. Behind descriptions of market reforms, monetary policy, and the convolutions of the Dow, I gradually made out the pieces of a grand narrative about the inner meaning of human history, why things had gone wrong, and how to put them right. Theologians call these myths of origin, legends of the fall, and doctrines of sin and redemption. But here they were again, and in only thin disguise: chronicles about the creation of wealth, the seductive temptations of statism, captivity to faceless economic cycles, and, ultimately, salvation through the advent of free markets, with a small dose of ascetic belt tightening along the way, especially for the East Asian economies.

      In my continuing effort to ignore the Democratic National Convention (and help you to do the same), I'll point you to this  urlLink excellent local paper write-up  on one of the participants in this year's  urlLink Badwater Ultramarathon .   The Badwater is a 135-mile running race, and is by invitation only. There is no cash prize to be had.   By the way, it starts in Death Valley. In July. And is basically uphill the whole way.   The author of the piece is my girlfriend's aunt,&nbsp;who served as the medical support for the runner she's writing about. Of particular interest is what happens to the human body under such extreme conditions:     To keep the runner as hydrated as possible in an attempt to prevent any heat related emergency, constant intake of fluid is required. A runner requires a minimum of 300 calories an hour to sustain this level of exertion, and a consistent replacement of electrolytes, critical to the runner's health. Martens consumed 41.75 litres of fluid (11 US gallons) and 19,000 calories during the race.    I think that in a time when many of us (myself very much included)&nbsp;tend to obsess over the political process, over cults of personality and the art of the possible, over the dangerous notion that the only way to make the world a better place is through social engineering, public policy, and ultimately--the threat of force; at a time when we pay far too much attention to nonexistent differences between  urlLink the puppet on the left and the puppet on the right , and wonder which one could make our lives better, I think that it does a world of good to contemplate what one individual human being can accomplish when they are sufficiently determined and committed.&nbsp;   (cross-posted at  urlLink Uncle Brian's Rant )

      To be fair, the problem of parents abdicating their responsibility for their kids transcends race and ethnicity, and even income level (I see a lot of gangsta-wannabees from out $300,000 houses with their droopy pants and all).  But  urlLink here's an article of interest  that proves a point I've been trying to make relative to African-Americans and what good Democrats have done them.   Spoken from a person I am growing more and more fond of as the days go by.  Platonically speaking, of course!

      Am I the only one who finds it passing strange that in this particular election season we will be subjected once more to the usual rant from the Left about the evils of wealth exactly at the moment they themselves put onto the stage the likes of  urlLink George Soros ,  urlLink Teresa Heinz Kerry , and - in fact - both ends of the  urlLink Democratic Ticket ?   Voltaire once said "It is difficult to free fools from the chains they revere," and this can be applied to us all at one time or another. Make no mistake about that.   If I were to list the dogmas I once fervently thought held the final truth for the world and mankind as we know it here on this website... I think the readership would be justified in walking away breathless. Or amused. Which ever came first.  Children have a talent for orgiastic spurts of rhetoric, but in my observation (having come out of the 60s) I knew that at the end of my "proprty is bullshit" speech  I was at least going to get laid, for cryn-out-loud!    Politics was different then... (Sigh)... With the sputterings and failures of socialist statism the world over, and the Free Love Movement now tottering towards a new meaning for the word   sixties   (ahem), screaming about fat cats really doesn't get you laid anymore.   Not only that, but while the vocal rank and file are out on the stump bemoaning the inequities of wealth in a society that still hasn't corrected the problems of this that and the other, because wealth is concentrated amongst a rarified few who can ignore so forth and so on... the funding for the airwaves for this rhetoric and the figureheads they put forward into public view are - themselves - some of the richest people American politics has ever seen.  And the funny thing about it is - they're not going to let you redistribute  their  wealth either.  Because even though they're in the same party; it  still  isn't yours.

      I've been sitting here reading your disertations of late and wanted to answer directly a few points of concern I've had with the vision of you proclaiming socialist virtues while you tell us you are not a socialist. Well... you can be a socialist here, as no one will think any the worse of you than they already do, I assure you! And I was just going to reply directly by comment beneath your missive but felt one broadside deserves another.  Rest assured - I happen to think your idea of "redistribution of wealth" is theft done with a halo of altruism. But I still think you're rather a nice fellow despite that breath-taking display of relative morality.   Simply put - there is no real justification for the redistribution of wealth without we must first posit that the people who have that wealth shouldn't have had it, or got it by foul means, or don't know the best ways to use it once they have it. Otherwise it is plainly theft, but with these cases we can at least make a relative justification for the theft.  Though you may be a beknighted genius and an enlightened one at that, and may be able to redistribute wealth fairly and create a wonderful over-funded paradise on Earth for all of God's children, some plain and simple facts escape you. I hate to pull the age argument, but I think - though you are certainly exceptionally intelligent and no one can gainsay that - you may need a bit more perspective before making a final pronouncement on this subject.  I started out in the early 50s in an ethnic Catholic urban neighborhood where English was a second language to the elders. They mucked out toilets and sold discarded fruit out of the backs of open-air carts and scrimped and saved and took the jobs the Anglos didn't want and whacked us over the head in private if we didn't speak English in public.   I didn't have a deferment to escape the draft for Viet Nam and was blessed and lucky to have a number so high there would have had to have been World War Three before they called me - because make no mistake about it, if my number came up I was going. I was born amongst the people that fight the wars for kids in Austin to play with half a million dollars worth of sound equipment.   And when I started working I punched a clock and begged for overtime. I always bought the car I could afford rather than the one I really wanted. Raised two kids and worked my ass off and now - at 50 - I have finally come to a place where I can see the rewards of 34 years of working for somebody else. It was my initiative, and my time away from home while my kids were growing up that got me where I am. And now I have a virtual baby-faced philosopher talking about how I don't pay enough in taxes or give enough to the poor or some such. It doesn't matter if I have been helping create  urlLink low-cost loans to inner-city businesses  along the way.   So Nick you will have to excuse me if I don't really care much whether or not you "remain unconvinced of the existence of this magical 'free market', which is alleged to reward people for hard work and perseverance." Maybe you haven't had to, I don't know. But I know one thing for certain;  You don't get to redistribute my wealth.   Because it isn't yours.

      Whenever&nbsp;politicians acknowledge economic inequity, they are either accused of "class warfare" or of&nbsp;being a "radical leftist" (whatever that means). Both Bush I in '88, and Bush II in 2000 accused their opponents of instigating class antagonism for political gains. Not surprisingly, both Gore and Dukakis responded by toning down the rhetoric.   In American politics , any talk of class inequities&nbsp;is considered rude and off-limits. I don't find this surprising, as our national history is one of division by class, race, and national origin.&nbsp;Our history is full of&nbsp;fierce domestic conflicts, and yes, dare I say it:&nbsp;they were class conflicts. But our popular conceptions of history push those conflicts into the margins. After all we are an "indivisible" nation. Better for Americans to mostly ignorant of the fact that the preamble of our constitution, "we the people", was written by wealthy slave-owners,&nbsp;in secret.    urlLink In Federalist Paper No. 10 , Madison wrote that the new constitution had to be ratified&nbsp;so that the&nbsp;government could control the masses from&nbsp;rebelling against&nbsp;"various and unequal distribution of property." Or as he&nbsp;called it more&nbsp;bluntly, "A rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal distribution of property, or for any other improper or wicked project." Without question, this rhetoric was related to&nbsp;a  urlLink Shays' rebellion ,&nbsp;which had just taken place in western Massachusetts.   I remain unconvinced&nbsp;of the existence of this magical&nbsp;"free market", which is alleged to&nbsp;reward people for hard work and perseverance. For all the teary-eyed rhetoric regarding free-market principles, I see quite a bit of hypocrisy. Our government is always willing to step-in when it is in favor of the rich. After congress passed the fugitive slave act,&nbsp;a slave who was a conservative rugged individualist might ask, "Why make the slave-owner dependent on the government?&nbsp;If he wants his&nbsp;slave back, he should do it himself."&nbsp;Wouldn't the&nbsp;"initiative" that the slave displayed by escaping show a great deal&nbsp;"self-reliance" and "pursuit of his best interest"?&nbsp;However, the government of the time would have&nbsp;answered was no- because it was a matter of property and money, not morality or basic respect for fellow man.   Our government&nbsp;is generally&nbsp;Laissez -fair when it comes to helping those&nbsp;who are sick, hungry, or homeless. This is undoubtedly related to the myth of&nbsp;"rugged Individualism." I recall historian Charles Beard, who wryly noted&nbsp;that industrial and financial leaders were not rugged enough to make their own way in the world.&nbsp;Indeed, its quite legitimate for big business to be subsidized,&nbsp;nursed, and protected&nbsp;by government intervention.&nbsp;Apparently thats a free market.&nbsp;   We&nbsp;have been quite liberal about&nbsp;using our military to intervene&nbsp;with the affairs of&nbsp;sovereign&nbsp;and democratic nations when&nbsp;they had threaten the well-being of our corporations.&nbsp;In 1954, the CIA&nbsp;master-minded the&nbsp;overthrow of the elected president of Guatemala, simply to insure the security of the United Fruit Company's property.&nbsp;In 1973 the U.S. government worked with the IT&T Corporation to overthrow the elected socialist leader of Chile, Salvador Allende. Indeed, Allende&nbsp;did give&nbsp;the&nbsp;foreign corporations, who had long&nbsp;exploited Chile's people and wealth,&nbsp;a tepid welcome.&nbsp;So we intervened. However, someone looses a job because of economic fluctuations, and they are told to be a "rugged invididualist".&nbsp;&nbsp;   Let me make one point clear: I'm not advocating socialism. I'm just pointing out hypocrisy. It strikes me (perhaps wrongly) as being pseudo-moral rhetoric&nbsp;which rationalizes&nbsp;injustice.&nbsp;I acknowledge&nbsp;that people are best motivated by their selfish interests. However, the right to have and&nbsp;display one's&nbsp;possessions is not born from&nbsp;a sense of morality.   The bottom 40 percent of households&nbsp;hold 1 percent of all the wealth in the nation; While the&nbsp;top 1 percent of all households have nearly 40 percent of all the wealth.&nbsp;Does that 1 percent deserve the opprotunities provided by&nbsp;that&nbsp;wealth as much as the bottom 40 percent doesn't?&nbsp;   I was lucky enough to&nbsp;go to a high school&nbsp;which&nbsp;served Austin's top 1%. When I was a 17 year-old pot head, I occasionally stage-managed a 1200 seat auditorium&nbsp;which had a&nbsp;$230,000 sound system,&nbsp;$80,000 of&nbsp;intelligent lights- a setup which&nbsp;was only rivaled by UT's Bass Concert Hall.&nbsp;Our football field had Astroturf, and a jumbotron.&nbsp;It was common gossip to hear that&nbsp;a fellow student&nbsp;had&nbsp;wrecked their&nbsp;Jaguar while they were drunk,&nbsp;3 days after their 16th birthday, so their parents bought them a Hummer (they gotta keep their druken princess safe).&nbsp;I am eternally&nbsp;grateful to&nbsp;my parents&nbsp;for raising me to see Westlake for what it was: a display of vanity.&nbsp;If there is anything I learned about wealth, its that&nbsp;it often becomes a vehical for vanity. Vanity is the great&nbsp;destroyer of our soul. Not surprisingly,&nbsp;our high school had one of the highest rates of drug-abuse in the nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Here is the point: I see no moral justification for why our football field had astro turf, when 20 miles away, schools&nbsp;were struggling to pay for text books.&nbsp;People don't endure the&nbsp;inner-city because they are lazy and immoral; rather,&nbsp;they are caught in a&nbsp;perpetual cycle of destruction. People are born into poverty and&nbsp;they go to impoverished schools which don't prepare them for college. The cycle goes round and round, while those who are protecting their interest tell them to show a bit of "rugged individualism".   Yes, I favor redistributing wealth through progressive taxations.&nbsp;Wealth is both the means to gain more wealth,&nbsp;and more importantly a&nbsp;token which allows people to survive.&nbsp;Its not a "token of worth"; if it was,&nbsp;it would mean that Darryl Strawberry was&nbsp;of more "worth" than Van Gogh, Mozart,&nbsp;Einstein, and&nbsp;Nelson Mandela combined.   I do not think that wealth should be redistributed because I'm selfish and want money that isn't mine. My reasons are parrall to what Einstein once explained:     "If one were to take that goal out of out of its religious form and look merely at its purely human side, one might state it perhaps thus: free and responsible development of the individual, so that he may place his powers freely and gladly in the service of all mankind.  I have never looked upon ease and happiness as ends in themselves - such an ethical basis I call more proper for a herd of swine. The ideals which have lighted me on my way and time after time given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been Truth, Goodness, and Beauty.     It is a lofty goal, but at least it strikes me as something worth striving for. That is why I'm a progressive: it might be idealistic, but at least its an attempt to attain something better than what we have now. My readers might judge me to be wrong, and I accept that I may very well be. My purpose in sharing these views was to put my beliefs out into the open, so that they may be inspected under bright lights. I respect those who have differing views, and I pledge to open my mind to them. In the end, I'd rather be wrong and set straight, than to delusionly hold onto false ideas.

       Adam L. Penenberg&nbsp;  urlLink  wrote a piece in Wired    where he&nbsp;asked a group of&nbsp;Internet "fashion police" to share their impressions of our politician's websites. I laughed so hard that I had to rip it for y'all.     urlLink The incumbent: President George W. Bush   Robinson: "Who is Bush's art director, Old Glory?"

Tuchman: "This website perfectly captures the candidate: uninspiring, monotonous, convoluted."  Eckstein: "Looks like it was thrown together faster than his decision to pick Edwards. It will probably change by next week -- the website and/or running mate."  Robinson: "This site navigates like a sinking ship. One page lists the link 'One Hundred Days to Change America.' How many days will it take to find this link from the homepage?"    urlLink Senate majority leader: Bill Frist (R-Tennessee)   Eckstein: "(This) website has the aesthetics of a phone bill. Good use of repeating dull photograph, though."  Robinson: "The graphics remind me of Fat Elvis: Tennessee icons meet pharmaceuticals."  Tuchman: "The top banner graphic showing a Tennessee Titan, mountain and guitar is more appealing than a logo consisting of a stack of assault rifles, an illegal abortion and oil-drilling rig."    urlLink Senate minority leader: Tom Daschle (D-South Dakota)   Tuchman: "Very informative. I learned he is still a senator. Note to webmaster: Change the typo at top where it says Democratic 'Leader.'"  Eckstein: "This website sums up why nobody cares about South Dakota."

Opprecht: "Don't they have the Internet in Vermont?"    urlLink Worst House website: Mac Collins (R-Georgia)   Tuchman: "Best viewed with Netscape Navigator v.2.0, and 9,600-bps modem."

      In our never-ending quest to cut through the rhetoric and spin we are all about to be subject to by the Demolicans and Repubcrats we have scoured the web to find independent agencies beholden to nobody who just publish them as they see them.  We keep permanent links of these guys in the right-hand sidebar and will do that 24/7, but I thought I would point out their location for those who don't look at blog sidebars.  You really should, you know. You actually can't live without what's over there. -----------------------   urlLink     Wherein we put back the words they took out of their opponent's actual quotes. -----------------------   urlLink     Wherein we flesh out the details that were omitted by one side or the other when talking about the other or one side. -----------------------   urlLink     Wherein you will find how much in donations Lindon LaRouche gets from the Post Office and the IRS. --------------------   I'll be more than happy to take a look at  your  suggestions for these kinds of agencies but be forewarned - there are plenty of them out there who are covers for the two majors.  If you bring any of those kind in here rest assured the rest of our Team will dump you in the whirlpool head first.  Take a look and repeat your visits often as they constantly update themselves.  Then get back here and ask me again why I react the way I do when one side or the other shows up here to spout the party line.

      Six months ago, I stumbled onto&nbsp; urlLink an article written by&nbsp;George Lakoff  + ,&nbsp;who is a&nbsp;professor of cognitive&nbsp;linguistics at UCLA. I'm almost entirely convinced that Lakoff found the key to the GOP's wild success during the last decade.     No matter what, don't think&nbsp;about pink elephants.     Without a doubt, you just thought about pink elephants. In order avoid thinking about pink elephants, you must first think about a pink elephants. Professor Lakoff uses&nbsp;that&nbsp;exercise to introduce his students to cognitive frames. Lakoff&nbsp;observed that&nbsp;Richard Nixon would never have infamously declared "I'm not a crook" had he taken cognitive linguistics.   Frames are mental structures which help us define relationships between words. For example, the word "pink elephant" is both a word and a frame.&nbsp;Any attempts to block the&nbsp;frame require you to&nbsp;activate the frame. For example, the reader might be unconsciously expecting me to reveal a pink elephant in the room&nbsp;that no one is talking about- that is the "pink elephant" frame at work.&nbsp;&nbsp;   The story of the GOPs success was&nbsp;their tailoring a unified message to the&nbsp;cognitive frame of conservatives. The failures of the Democratic party are strongly linked with their ignorance of framing. Lakoff's research&nbsp;found the political worldviews of progressives and conservatives could be understood as opposing models of an ideal family. Conservatives are understood through a strict father family model were as progressives are understood by the nurturing&nbsp;parent family model*. Embedded within these models are systems of morality&nbsp;which create powerful frames for every political issue.    The Strict Father&nbsp;Frame of the&nbsp;Conservatives: &nbsp;   In strict father family views the world as dangerous, unfriendly, and immoral. To the strict father, the survival of his children depends on them having discipline, a strong sense of morality, and a good work ethic. The strict father views himself as the supporter and protector of his family. His strong sense of moral authority creates a need for him to control the women in his family, especially in matters of sexuality and reproduction.   The strict father believes that the pursuit of self interest is a moral undertaking. If everybody pursued their own self-interest, the self-interest of all will be maximized. Thus, he views those who are unsuccessful as being undisciplined, and lazy. For him, it is better to allow them to suffer so that one day they might acquire the discipline required to succeed in the world.   If we translate this view into politics, the conservatives view the government as a strict father. The purpose of government is to support (maximize wealth) and protect (strong military and strict criminal law). To the strict father government, there are two types of citizens: Mature and&nbsp;disciplined citizens who should be left alone, and lazy and immoral citizens who should grow up.   Domestically, the strict father wishes to preserve and extend the power of his morality. This translates into opposition to social safety nets (I work hard so why should I support the lazy),&nbsp; opposition to reproductive rights (people should be held accountable for their promiscuity), and support of strict criminal laws (If the punishment is bad enough, worthwhile people will be compelled to not break the law). The strict father does not believe the wealthy should be taxed, as they have worked hard and deserve their full reward. Needless to say, the strict father supports&nbsp;the church's influence&nbsp;government,&nbsp;&nbsp;as he views religion as&nbsp;the ultimate&nbsp;protector of morality.   In foreign matters, the strict father sees the power of the United States as evidence of its moral superiority. He won't stand for weaker nations (which are presumably lazy and immoral) that&nbsp;attempt to interfere with our just and superior will.  --  Unlike the Democrats, the&nbsp;Republicans are experts in utilizing cognitive&nbsp;frames. The strict father model was likely the end result of the billions of dollars which flooded conservative think tanks after the Goldwater debacle. A comparison between GOP's agenda and behavior to Lakoff's strict father model reveals a neat little package.. The strict father provided the GOP with a cognitively-unified message;&nbsp;framing was the&nbsp;key to their success.    Toward a Unified Frame for Progress    The Democrat's ignorance of framing&nbsp;has led&nbsp;them to repeatedly shoot themselves in the foot. Lakoff gave a rather telling example; consider the below statement.     I'm against Bush's plan for tax relief   .   The word "relief" evokes a&nbsp;frame of heroic rescue. In this frame, a hero (Bush), relieves&nbsp;the victim (Americans), from an unendurable affliction (taxes). Thus, the above statement in blue is in fact saying, "Americans should continue to suffer their affliction." Yet, Democrats ignorance to framing has led to them constantly&nbsp;declaring opposition to the&nbsp;tax cuts by&nbsp;using&nbsp;Bush's frame of&nbsp;"tax relief". &nbsp;In a sense, by doing so they are providing the GOP a&nbsp;nearly priceless gift.   Kerry desperately&nbsp;needs to re-frame his agenda. His incessant barrage of equivocating remarks: "a stronger America", "a better future",&nbsp; all need to&nbsp;boxed away to&nbsp;gather dust in his rhetorical attic. The Democrats tiresome message tends to be issue by issue, and cut between various&nbsp;interest groups.&nbsp;They needs to show moral fervor in the way that Republicans do. &nbsp;   Lakoff attempted a rough draft of the progressive frame, but I found it to be uncompelling as a whole. Its greatest weakness, for lack of a better word, is its overwhelming femininity. It relies to heavily on words like "empathic" or "nurturing". A nascar dad would look upon it as a view for "dandy idealists".   However, he did provide us with a some good places to start. In regards to abortion, progressives should re-frame the debate away from a question of "balancing morality with woman's rights"&nbsp;and more toward a moral&nbsp;cause for protecting&nbsp;freedom. The state should not be involved in a womans pregnancy. We must preserve the freedom of women to choose when, if, and by whom they will have children.   In post-September 11th politics, progressives should re-frame the word "security". Security includes keeping our harbors, cities, and air ports safe. It also includes safe neighborhoods and schools (gun control). Security is having safe water, air and food (environmental reform). &nbsp;Safety implies being able to live healthily (help for uninsured, social security, etc.)   Perhaps the most powerful frame from progressives is "our children's future". It covers everything from deficit spending, to better education, to environmental reform, to the dismantling of nuclear arms.   However, progressives will need to work together to formulate this view. Lakoff gave&nbsp;us wise&nbsp;last words of advise:   Articulate your ideals, frame what you believe effectively, say what you believe and say it well, strongly and with moral fervor.  Re framing is telling the truth as we see it -- telling it forcefully, straightforwardly and articulately, with moral conviction and without hesitation. The language must fit the conceptual re-framing, a re-framing from the perspective of progressive values. It is not just a matter of words, though the right ones are needed to evoke progressive frames.   And stop saying "tax relief."

      George F. Will recently asserted that the electoral college, like the constitution, "was not devised by, and should not be revised by, simple-minded majoritarians." Indeed, the electoral college was a brilliant 18th century solution to clusters of 18th century problems.   There were three good reasons that the constitutional convention rejected the idea of direct elections for the presidency. First off, there was no method of communication that could sufficiently educate voters about presidential candidates. Secondly, our framers worried that the masses had neither the education, nor the refinement required to make prudent decisions. Thirdly, the implementation of national elections would have upset the balance of power among states. For example, direct presidential elections would cause the south to lose most of its political power. Under the electoral college, slaves couldn't vote, but could be still counted as 3/5 man when deciding the number of Representatives and electors for states.  Obviously, the 18th century argument no longer applies in our era of telecommunications and universal suffrage. The only other argument heard from the electoral-collegiophiles is essentially Burkean. So the argument goes, changing the rules for electing presidents would shift entire political "solar system" in ways hard to foresee. With candidates concentrating on votes instead of states, campaign strategies might change for the worse. Yet, these arguments boil down to expecting proponents of direct elections to see future events; it assumes that the old is better by the simple fact that its old. I for one don't wake up in cold sweats after nightmares in which the American public, not the electoral college, elected our president. So why abolish the electoral college? Here are three good reasons:   First off, the electoral college operates under a winner-take-all method: a state's majority, no matter how thin, gets all of the state's electors. This causes millions of votes to be effectively uncounted  Secondly, the electoral college discourages millions of Americans from voting. If a voter supports a red candidate in a blue state, they will probably not waste their time voting. Moreover, states have no incentive to increase voter turnout. A state's delegates cast the same number of electoral votes no matter how many people actually vote.  Finally, the electoral college favors voters from rural states over voters from populous states. Electoral votes are not allocated according to population. Below is the number of electoral votes given to every million people by state:   Wyoming:  13.4  electoral votes/million people North Dakota:  10.4  electoral votes/million people Michigan:  4.2  electoral votes/million people Illinois:  4.6  electoral votes/million people   Americans should ask themselves why a vote in Wyoming should count three times more than a vote in Michigan. Furthermore, it bears noting that no other democracy has a body that is similar to the electoral college. And just think: if we abolish the electoral college we will never hear about Ohio, swing voters, or blue and red states again. That alone would be worth the effort.

      net the problem is that you and I cut our teeth long ago on the History Channel religion board.

      There’s been a lot of talk this political season about “hate” for this that and the other. I Hate Bush, I hate Kerry, I hate the war, I hate liberals, I hate Republicans, I hate Chaney, I hate for food, I hate it when that happens… you know.  But I think we should really differentiate between actual, realtime hate and mere rhetorical hate. The problem is we are getting the two very distinct versions of hate mixed up to the point where it is hurting our abilities to communicate.  And I know that the common wisdom says we shouldn’t hate and that hate is bad but, really, we all go off and do it anyway so who are we are trying to fool? I hate that.   ·	You are the only one to see the object of your hatred slip in the parking lot and break their hip.   IF IT’S RHETORICAL HATE you laugh but call the ambulance. IF IT’S REAL HATE you make a trip to the bathroom and take your time and you really don’t care if that does something to your karma or not.   ·	In politics, you discover there is another version to the story the opposition tells about an incident in their past.  IF IT’S RHETORICAL HATE you use the other version to marginalize the opposition, and hope the revelation loses them votes so you can win the election. IF IT’S REAL HATE you use the other version to marginalize the opposition, hope the revelation loses them votes so you can win the election, continue to pound them for it in the media and on the net years after both of you are out of office, and sell books explaining the other side of the story on your web site. When their children get into politics you remind voters what a jerk their parent was, and then you try to find the dirt on them too.  So the point is we have to be able to differentiate the degree of hate we’re witnessing. I would recommend giving a pass to the rhetorical version.   But I really hate the other kind.

      Somewhere along the line liberal has become a four-letter word.  I believe it started with Rush, but the real blame lies with liberals themselves.  When political hacks such as Rush or O’Reilly point the finger and apply the liberal tag, liberals do their best to cloak themselves in a moderate, if not conservative robe.   It’s almost comical to watch our politicians distancing themselves from the left while providing justification after justification for any vote they made which might be interpreted as liberal.  Why is that exactly?   Liberal.  Last time I checked, a liberal politician is one who is progressive, open-minded, willing to change.  It is also associated with politicians who place more importance on social programs than on the military.  Taking this even further, it’s been a label put upon those who are willing to negotiate with adversaries and try peaceful means to solve problems instead of relying on force.  So, to Rush, O’Reilly, and others of their ilk, I ask “what’s your point?”  Since when have these characteristics become bad?  On the contrary, these are characteristics of which one should be proud.  They are traits attributed to those who have learned from the past and realized violence is used only as a last and extreme resort.  They are traits shared by those who place more value on humanity and peace than they do on monetary wealth and power.  They are traits of people who understand that we are not blessed with an even playing field and that many people can use a leg up.  And they are traits of people who have learned from life that compassion is more important than preservation of capital.  So instead of running from this label I say to everyone else, you’re damn right I’m a liberal, and why the hell aren’t you?   Boileryard and I go back a few years and he has had the unfortunate experience of hearing this rant of mine before.  Even though I personally am not a Christian, this nation prides itself on being founded on Christian principles.  Many make the argument that this nation is in fact a Christian nation and that’s what our founding fathers intended.  Regardless of my own personal religious affiliation (Buddhism) I throw my hat in with Christians in stating that the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew chapters 5 through 7) is probably one of the finest pieces of pure theological teachings we have today.   Here are some of the finer points.  Blessed are the meek.  Blessed are the peacemakers.  Agree with your adversary quickly.  Turn the other cheek.  Give to him who asks you and from him who wants to borrow from you do not turn away.  Love your enemies.  Judge not.  Now call me crazy, but those sound like liberal teachings to me.   Am I bringing religion into politics and breaking down the imaginary wall of separation?  Perhaps.  But I’m trying to do the opposite of what I see being done in this country today.  I’m basing my political beliefs on what I’ve learned to be morally correct principles instead of re-defining my religious beliefs to fit into my political box.  So that said, at long last here comes my point.  When you read this do you find yourself thinking that this sounds great but that these teachings are not very realistic in today’s political climate?  Do you believe that these teachings only work if everyone participates?  If so, you are not alone.  I’m suspicious myself.  So here are my questions: if being a liberal and following the teachings of Jesus and the Buddha are not doable and practical today, then why keep up the premise of being a Christian nation?  Are we not guilty of the same behavior of those who have hijacked the Muslim religion?  Why go to the bother of changing our religious teachings to fit our political beliefs when they so obviously contradict each other?  I know I run the risk of offending many, but after reading the teachings of the Buddha and reading the Sermon on the Mount, the only way I can justify supporting the Republican, Democrat, or Libertarian parties would be to judge these teachings as either impractical or secondary, and choose to follow political dogma instead.

      I hear people all the time saying President Bush should not be using his religious convictions to form his policies, and that he is at the beck and call of the "Religious Right."  But what I want to know is, if a person says we shouldn't be fighting because it is against a religious ethic...  what is the distinction being made here?  Should a President not use his religious convictions to make policy? Should a President make policy only based on a certain aspect of his religious convictions? Or does this particular President have the wrong religious convictions? And who gets to say that?  If you have been a critic of the President based on his bringing his religious convictions into the mix, are you saying that shouldn't be done at all or that he has the wrong convictions?  And if you would like to see a foreign policy based only on the helping aspects of your religion's altruistic principles - are those the right convictions or shouldn't  you  have them in the first place?   Further, are his critics saying  they  own the correct interpretation of what religious convictions a President should use, and he doesn't?  Is that what his critics are saying?   Is that what he may be saying?  Anybody out there???

        We are witnessing the ominous rise of the most powerful empire ever to exist. Judging from consistent media reports and opinion polls, the rest of the world seems to view it as a menacing rogue state that is arrogantly bullying other nations, east and west, north and south, into unqualified submission to its self-declared designs for world domination and incontestable economic supremacy.  Yes, the quote above is from  urlLink an outsider's point-of-view , but I must admit it has the uncomfortable ring of truth...  America, in it's many recent Administrative manifestations, has gotten too big for it's britches...and the world is coming to take it down a peg or two.  Sooner or later, it'll happen.  Some of us won't be surprised.

      I'm calling it nameless running around.  It beats "Tidbits" or "Bits and tids" or "fragments of thought" or "odds and ends" - which is what this is going to be. But "Nameless Running Around" is a term an old theatre director I had used to call stage movement that didn't have a purpose. When he didn't like what we were doing in a scene he'd unleash a tirade and say "you people aren't loud enough, you're looking at the audience, and you people upstage have got to stop all that nameless running around up there."  So here's today's edition...   I'm tired of hearing about First Ladies and potential First Ladies and I'm tired of hearing  from  them. Mrs Kerry is boorish and Mrs Bush is dull.  I'm not voting for their husbands but if I was it wouldn't be because of their wives. It would probably be in spite of their wives. And the same would hold true if we were talking about First Gentlemen - only I'd probably be a WHOLE lot harsher.   I don't really care what a First Lady does or what they did or what their pet project is. I know I get them as part of the package but nobody elects them to anything - and I resent (with a big  R ) the implication that they get to order stuff around. They aren't in the constitution and they are usually unpleasant to look at in any case and I think the media should shut it down on them already. Unless somebody marries Halle Barry and gets elected President I'm not interested - tell them to go away.  Another thing I'm sick of is Barack Obama. I live in Illinois and I don't like the idea of party bosses handpicking a pretty little fellow nobody outside Chicago ever heard of and the general media annointing him without so much as a by-your-leave. I think he is an invented bit of fluff.   I think it is a ridiculous thing to imagine that somebody like Alan Keyes isn't electable because he is a man of Principle, while the press already has Obama in the White House and nobody even knows what the hell he stands for!  And finally, I don't really care what candidate did drugs or did whatever you got when they were in college. I think there should be an election requirement that you  HAD  to have done something really really stupid and dangerous at least once in your life or you have no business being President.  At ease.

      Here's a not so funny funny story. I went to a couple forums to announce that our team blog is looking for one more member and then we will close the roster. A line-up of 9 is a complete batting order, you see.   I also felt that, because poor Trish is a bit surrounded by low voices we ought to see if we can get another female voice on board. And I put out a call for such.  I got a "scrubbed" email at the hotmail acount marked "Predators" - and promptly changed the "ads." I guess it could have been misconstrued.  That said, however...   We really are looking for a female voice to finish out the roster here. If you are reading us and feel you get the gist of what we're trying to accomplish here - and you can abide by the "guests get the last word" rule, please think about it.  And, looking at the lineup as it is, I think we could use a conservative to even things out.  Me being the moderate that I am... heh heh heh.  Use the email link in the right hand column to talk to us.   P.S. I am a happily married man. Ciao!

      Well I've been doing an informal search for a few days now. It started with just two entries of three little words each in Google. The first entry was I Hate Bush, and the next entry was I hate Kerry.  Sorry to report, but from this highly unscientific survey, the Left owns the spew... and hands down.   You have to discern who is spoofing who. Sometimes a spew was directed at the Republicans and then followed with a spew against the Democrats. Those kinds of things aren't added here. Equal opportunity spews are actually OK, and I almost linked a few - and still might.  No, I was looking for the  real spew .   Things that ranged from  urlLink Why We Hate Bush , and over to  urlLink Cats Hate Bush.   Where Republicans had "Blogs for Bush" - which we didn't include here because there was enough intellectual activity there to mask any spew that was in the club, Democrats had entire  urlLink WebRings  dedicated to hating Bush.   There were two anti-Kerry sites that we would include in the mix as being spew. Obviously  urlLink I Hate John Kerry  fit the bill, as well as  urlLink Crush Kerry .  But the sheer volumn - and volume - of the anti-Bush sites was overwhelming.  urlLink Bush and Cheney Suck , those  urlLink Evil GOP Bastards .    Bush is hated by what claims to be the  urlLink independent media in the USA  (both sides equally claim the "media" is a tool of their opponent, which is weird but not really unusual.) as well as  urlLink independent commentators from Europe .  Some are  urlLink really pretty funny , but others are just  urlLink bitter and cruel . Some are so  urlLink expected they're actually kind of boring , others become  urlLink unexpectedly mean-spirited .  Some  urlLink barely conceal their hatred , while others at least try to be  urlLink humorous about it .   When all is said and done, however, I have to say the Left contains the most active spew going.   But since this is a venue that (just to remind everybody) seriously doubts  everyone's  motives and intentions, I'd be more than happy to have you folks show me the spew from the other side I may have missed.

       "WASHINGTON - One of the greatest coups in Washington's nearly three-year war against al-Qaeda has suddenly turned sour with reports that the White House prematurely exposed the identity of a key source whose contacts and communication with the terrorist group's operational masterminds had yet to be fully exploited.  "And to compound the United States' embarrassment, Pakistan has angrily protested to Washington over a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) sting operation involving a fake plot to kill Pakistan's ambassador to the United Nations, describing it as "a bizarre mission".    Poor judgment from the White House seems to have fed the poor judgment of the New York Times.  If we were all any more stupid and selfish we'd be France... Read  urlLink From One Blunder To The Next  from Asia Times Online.  excerpts:  "By exposing the only deep mole we've ever had within al-Qaeda, it ruined the chance to capture dozens if not hundreds more," a former Justice Department prosecutor, John Loftus, told Fox News on Saturday."    "...Even staunchly loyal Republicans said the White House had made a serious mistake. "In this situation, in my view, they should have kept their mouth shut and just said, 'We have information, trust us'," said Virginia Senator George Allen..."   We can blame the New York Times for taking something said "on deep background" and making it public, thereby queering the dope. But "on deep background" is not "off the record." The phrase is used to keep hidden the identity of the person releasing the data, not to keep it out of print and furthermore everybody knows that.  Why a member of the administration even bothered to let it go to the NYT is another question altogether.  *Make a smiley with a crooked mouth here*

         Foundations    1. The principle purpose of the foreign policy of the United States should be to maintain the liberty of the American people.  2. War by its very nature tends to concentrate power in the hands of the central state, thus threatening the American ideals of limited government and the separation of powers.  3. In matters of foreign policy, the only thing that can destroy this country is the same thing that historically destroyed all the world's great powers: Over extension of its commitments and its resources.  4. History has shown that centralization of power to the executive, the threat to civil liberties at home, and the extension of commitments beyond any nation's capacity to meet them, are the three most dangerous and threatening conditions that can arise when a nation activates a highly interventionist foreign policy.  Therefore be it known that the Boileryard Doctrine shall consist of said Foundations, and that what follows here contains the whole of the line of reasoning...  America is an idea founded on the understandings that the social order is spontaneous rather than planned or directed, people should be free to pursue their own individual purposes as long as they do not interfere with the rights of others to do likewise, and ultimately we are a civil association operating under the rule of law.  Washington, Jefferson, and J.Q. Adams advanced the foreign policy premise that while we must accept the need to resort to warfare whenever the liberty and survival of the American people was directly threatened, war should never be undertaken to advance any other purpose.  To further inform this premise it should be stated that:  Liberty takes primacy over the access to raw materials, because raw materials can be lawfully obtained in the marketplace and liberty cannot.   It is not, therefore, our beholden duty to advance the notion that we have been given a divine mission to bring freedom to others. Nor are we ordained to embark upon a crusade to liberate them,  unless  those conditions we seek to change threaten American liberty directly. Then this should be the sole criterion which congress must use as a benchmark to judge whether or not we ever engage in war as a nation, in deliberation over the lawful request made by the executive.   The United States of America should maintain a "free hand" in pursuance of its foreign policy, and clearly define the concluding principles...   1. We must at all times insist upon the standing of our own sovereignty.  2. Binding commitments that create new, or expand existing, obligations to foreign entities should be opposed.  3. While it is proper to promote and encourage freedom around the world, we should not meanly justify a desire to impose our understandings of freedom upon others where the standards others live by do not hinder our liberty.  4. Our devotion to the ideal of liberty ought to extend to other nations' and other peoples' ownership of their own history and culture.   The question is; are we willing to forego de facto empire status as the world's hyper-power in order to implement the patient, incremental pursuit of a system in which equality under the law supecedes power as the basis of international relations?  This is the question that could well determine whether America proceeds from the century it owned into a future it holds / or if it shall merely reside in the history books of that future as yet another great state, that failed.  Direct Theft of key phrases for this article was done to  urlLink The Ashbrook Center , The  urlLink Independent Institute  and  urlLink Joseph R. Stromberg  - while all of us attempt to codify the foreign policy principles of  urlLink Robert A. Taft.

      Millions... (billions?) of dollars spent over the last 50 years have been wasted by the federal government spanning the administrations of both parties and involving their collusion to steal money from the American taxpayer.  From the threat of nuclear war to the high-tech development of suits for deep space travel, the US government has purposely misled the taxpaying public shamelessly and without cause.  Only recently has this greater truth been uncovered, but it has become obvious to the more careful observers that the technology that went into everything from fallout shelters to the skin of spacecraft could have been handled at a fraction of the cost...   Especially after witnessing the inability of microwaves to penetrate mashed potatos or lasagna.  The economic ramifications are staggering. I'm certain it has something to do with Roswell...

      As a conservative living in Illinois I suppose I should be happy to see Alan Keyes in the race for Senator.  As a libertarian I am non-plussed. So that's a wash.  But as a Christian, Mr Keyes' standing, in my eyes, has been somewhat diminished.  And unless I've missed the rationale, I can't see his decision to run as being anything but relative morality.    "I deeply resent the destruction of federalism represented by Hillary Clinton’s willingness go into a state she doesn't even live in and pretend to represent people there, so I certainly wouldn't imitate it."  Alan Keyes, 2000.  I have had Republican friends tell me things like "if they can do it, so can we," or even "it is being done for a higher purpose than what Hillary could muster."  Uh-huh.  Except what it comes down to is the liberal ideal that there really isn't a certain right or wrong, there are only gray areas. Well, there may be gray areas in some things, but if what another does is wrong you doing the same thing doesn't make it right.  I think we deserve an explanation, but I'm afraid it won't be consistent with Mr Keyes' religious convictions. "Fundamentalist" Christians are not in the business of relative morality since they hold that morality itself comes from God. So plain and simple - if it was immoral for Hillary to do this in New York it is equally so for Alan to do it in Illinois.  I know he will say things I agree with more than he will say things I disagree with.   But there is a principle involved here.  And once again - in all my arguing with the GOP decision-makers I have to repeat: "Republicans operate on politics. Conservatives operate on principles. Democrats operate on everybody."  This time, however, the joke is on the first part of the axiom. This and the spending spree is making a mockery of Republican claims to the mantel of "conservatism."  How can Mr Keyes now be a "moralist" when the definition of morality has become so fluid?

      And so yes here is yet another tedious definition of labels article that are so overdone these days. "This one however," he said "is important to you."  Every once in a while I find myself acting like  urlLink Nathan Bedford Forrest.  This usually happens when I have to set some poor liberal fellow straight on a few items, only to discover when I turn around I then have to do the same for someone calling themself a "conservative."  You remember Nathan... he's the guy who found himself surrounded and when they asked him what they should do he told his troops to "split in two and charge both ways."  I know it is only because I am a merciless pedant and curmudgeon-in-training (don't you have to at least be 60 first?), and I also know that I am running against the  modern  definitions of the L and C words. But I have to admit it is fun being a bit of a throwback... though some would contest that's what I am.  While most people view the differences between a conservative and a liberal as being the same difference between the past and the future, I (unfortunately for you, dear Yard-reader) view the differences between a conservative and a liberal as being the same difference between being and becoming...    You see, to my way of thinking, the conservative considers some things as certain truths; we are supposed to be considered equal under the law and that is sufficient -  while the liberal considers that any truth can be relative and while that is the goal there is no such thing right now as equality under the law.  Therefore the conservative's view is developed from the idea that equality already is, and the liberal's view is developed from the idea that equality ain't.  When a conservative stands against affirmative action it is because they have begun with the assumption that it undermines the whole idea of equality. When a liberal stands for affirmative action it is because they have begun with the assumption that there is no such thing as equality.  To the conservative we are already equal. To the liberal we are not. So the conservative is already doing what happens when equality exists, while the liberal is forever trying to get there.  Being and becoming.  None of this holds true, however, for the sociopaths that often hide under the garb of "legitimate" conservatism or "legitimate" liberalism. Here I am talking about the skinhead who attaches himself to conservatism. He isn't actually a conservative - he is actually an ethnic socialist just manipulating people with a faux-conservative mindset. And the "America Is Always Wrong And We Should Hate Ourselves Unendingly" hairbrain who attaches himself to liberalism is also not a true liberal in that liberty is the last thing he is after, and is also manipulating the discussion.  The true liberal honestly believes that it is government's duty to redress inherent problems by intervention. The true conservative honestly believes that there are certain and specific duties a government needs to address and then nothing further.  Any form of social engineering through government intervention is not conservatism. This is why the so-called 'religious right" is not in the true school of traditional conservatism.  I have written before that I believe there are many people who do not understand that conservatism is actually a more dynamic approach to the human condition than it is portrayed or often portrays itself as.   To me, it is the difference between being and becoming.  This, i feel, is also why it is so hard for some liberals to fathom blacks or latinos who are politically conservative.  Since they believe, without being conscious of it, that we are forever "becoming", there is an unspoken assumption that "they" can't possibly ever be there.  This is why people like  urlLink Walter Williams  have a right to observe "If there is one general characteristic of white liberals, it's their condescending and demeaning attitude toward blacks."    It is a matter of being and becoming.  (And yet another hat-tip to  urlLink La Shawn  for the lead to Williams' article. Wonder if she'll be a team member one day?)

      It is basically impossible for those of us born in the 1970's or later to fully grasp the magnitude of effect the Vietnam War has had on the American psyche. We grew up in its immediate aftermath, but were really too young to understand the significance of all the withdrawn fathers with drinking problems, of the homeless missing arms and legs, of the seemingly inexplicable hatred towards Asians and Jane Fonda.   One of my earliest truly clear memories is from when my family visited Washington, DC, when I was about 7, not long after the Vietnam Memorial opened. My father, who had served in the Air Force and had been stationed in Europe the whole time, walked along the endless monolith of names. He stopped suddenly, and I saw a look on his face I'd never seen before, and I'm not sure that I've seen since.  He was looking at his own name.  Obviously, not  his  name, but that of someone with the same name, who instead of living comfortably with his wife and two kids, was dead in a jungle on the other side of the world.  I always come back to that moment whenever the subject of one's service in Vietnam or avoidance thereof comes up. Needless to say, I've been  urlLink thinking about it a lot lately .  I've come to a place where I simply cannot judge what any indivdual did during that time in our history. Whether they volunteered and fought with honor, were drafted and faked injuries to come home, joined the National Guard or the military press to stay out of harm's way, extended their stay at Oxford, or permanently expatriated--I can't blame them. I cannot honestly say that confronted with the possibility of conscription, I wouldn't have booked it to Canada myself.  And unless they lived through that situation (and many did),   neither can anyone else .   Vietnam has been an issue in every presidential campaign in which there was a candidate young enough to have fought. It was an issue with Clinton, with Gore, with Bush II, and now with John Kerry. So I'm left to wonder whether the current focus on how Kerry and Bush spent that part of their lives is because as a nation, we simply cannot get past Vietnam, or because both sides are crassly pandering to this vulnerability.  Actually, that's not true. I don't really wonder at all.  (Cross-posted at  urlLink Uncle Brian's Rant )

      netpilot has requested, and an illustrious guest has indicated, that we need to bring into some focus the various points raised re: the relativity of the Sermon On The Mount and other Christian teachings to foreign affairs and such.  The structure of blogs isn't aslways friendly to long spans of verbiage like a discussion board, so I've made an effort to bring together the various comments that are germane to the issue.  For this we shall waive the rule of ONE RESPONSE allowed the ORIGINAL AUTHOR, because by now that line is totally blurred.  I do believe, in fairness, that I responded to all of net's points, but could be wrong. So here is the full monty (warning - LONG! This is not for the faint of heart, nor is it for the lower order of attention span! - insert smiley)...    netpilot:  Somewhere along the line liberal has become a four-letter word. I believe it started with Rush, but the real blame lies with liberals themselves. When political hacks such as Rush or O’Reilly point the finger and apply the liberal tag, liberals do their best to cloak themselves in a moderate, if not conservative robe. It’s almost comical to watch our politicians distancing themselves from the left while providing justification after justification for any vote they made which might be interpreted as liberal. Why is that exactly?  Liberal. Last time I checked, a liberal politician is one who is progressive, open-minded, willing to change. It is also associated with politicians who place more importance on social programs than on the military. Taking this even further, it’s been a label put upon those who are willing to negotiate with adversaries and try peaceful means to solve problems instead of relying on force.  So, to Rush, O’Reilly, and others of their ilk, I ask “what’s your point?” Since when have these characteristics become bad? On the contrary, these are characteristics of which one should be proud. They are traits attributed to those who have learned from the past and realized violence is used only as a last and extreme resort. They are traits shared by those who place more value on humanity and peace than they do on monetary wealth and power. They are traits of people who understand that we are not blessed with an even playing field and that many people can use a leg up. And they are traits of people who have learned from life that compassion is more important than preservation of capital. So instead of running from this label I say to everyone else, you’re damn right I’m a liberal, and why the hell aren’t you?   Boileryard and I go back a few years and he has had the unfortunate experience of hearing this rant of mine before. Even though I personally am not a Christian, this nation prides itself on being founded on Christian principles. Many make the argument that this nation is in fact a Christian nation and that’s what our founding fathers intended. Regardless of my own personal religious affiliation (Buddhism) I throw my hat in with Christians in stating that the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew chapters 5 through 7) is probably one of the finest pieces of pure theological teachings we have today.   Here are some of the finer points. Blessed are the meek. Blessed are the peacemakers. Agree with your adversary quickly. Turn the other cheek. Give to him who asks you and from him who wants to borrow from you do not turn away. Love your enemies. Judge not. Now call me crazy, but those sound like liberal teachings to me.   Am I bringing religion into politics and breaking down the imaginary wall of separation? Perhaps. But I’m trying to do the opposite of what I see being done in this country today. I’m basing my political beliefs on what I’ve learned to be morally correct principles instead of re-defining my religious beliefs to fit into my political box.  So that said, at long last here comes my point. When you read this do you find yourself thinking that this sounds great but that these teachings are not very realistic in today’s political climate? Do you believe that these teachings only work if everyone participates? If so, you are not alone. I’m suspicious myself. So here are my questions: if being a liberal and following the teachings of Jesus and the Buddha are not doable and practical today, then why keep up the premise of being a Christian nation? Are we not guilty of the same behavior of those who have hijacked the Muslim religion? Why go to the bother of changing our religious teachings to fit our political beliefs when they so obviously contradict each other?  I know I run the risk of offending many, but after reading the teachings of the Buddha and reading the Sermon on the Mount, the only way I can justify supporting the Republican, Democrat, or Libertarian parties would be to judge these teachings as either impractical or secondary, and choose to follow political dogma instead.   Boileryard Clarke:  You and I both come from a teacher who explained that religion is best understood in the realm of metaphor, and when we make it literal and solid we lose the poetry and thus the deeper meaning.  Christian, Jewish and Muslim "nations" have all lost the metaphor and the lesson - and we see the result.  But to your point - I guess I don't see the relation "liberal" has with your examples.  A political liberal also believes in reform, and that government can address the ills of society. Therefore they are inclined to make a program to coerce and enforce the principles you ask we apply. Forced cheek turning. Forced meekness. Forced love. And so on.  What exactly is "Christian" about forcing anything?   The essence of religion is that it comes from within. If we've learned anything we should know that the benefits come in the realm of personal revelation. By the same token the Bible never expresses that a Christian should be a doormat.  You - netpilot - have the living kind of religion. It has never been anything but admirable. On you it fits, and I happen to personally know that you have driven yourself to abide by what you believe. We should be thankful there are people like you who take the metaphor and the lesson seriously. You show a lot of people the way. But you may be a very dangerous man in government, when all is said and done.   Liberal politics from this framework can also be seen as being next to the installation of a theocracy. That's what Muslim Supremacists are trying to do. And should we instill Christian ideals as the so-called Religious Right sees them? God forbid (there, I said it).  When I stood against the government in the 60s I stood against statism and government telling people what they should do. Liberty and liberal seemed a whole lot closer then. But today's liberal isn't about liberty.  They aren't against statism.   They are the state.   And this, you see, is my problem. I feel I kept the faith, as it were, and remained a "true liberal," while what morphed out of my fellows is a Nanny just itching to do what is best for me. Read: Get into aspects of my life an outside entity has no business being in.  And I would be a hypocrite to change now, as I feel "the Left" (as it is now constituted) truly is. At least from that frame of reference.   Boileryard Clarke:  net the problem is that you and I cut our teeth long ago on the History Channel religion board. You KNOW that at least makes us partially idiots, but mostly it makes us incapable of forming a cogent thought relative to religion.  Well that goes for me anyhow...  But here's a post by someone who is slowly becoming a very good friend of mine (webwise of course) that I saw today...and I think it speaks to our discussion.  Why... it almost looks like she was spying on us don't it? Her name is La Shawn Barber and she's a class act all the way.  Here's the article titled Jesus Was a Liberal ....    urlLink La Shawn Barber   "Reverend" Jesse Jackson makes some ignorant and incorrect assertions in his latest column, but I want to focus on one: the crack about Jesus being a liberal.   I cringe not at the idea that my Lord and Savior is a Democrat; I cringe because Jackson, a professing Christian, deliberately panders to those with little or no understanding of who Jesus is and what the Bible reveals about him.  People unfamiliar with the Bible tend to select verses and principles out of context to support a particular position. But Scripture must be compared with Scripture and interpreted in light of the whole Bible. There is no excuse for a so-called reverend, particularly one who attended seminary (didn’t finish), to make such errors. For political gain, however, he seems willing to deceive the unsuspecting about the nature of God. Jackson writes:  Think about it: A conservative Christian is a contradiction in terms. Christ wasn’t a conservative. He fed the hungry simply because they were hungry. He didn’t require that they go to work first. He healed the sick, simply because they were sick. He didn’t push them into an insurance company, or let the drug companies gouge them on prices. Jesus was a liberal; Herod was the conservative.  Implicit is the common notion that conservatives don’t care about the poor. Liberals think they’ve cornered the market on compassion simply because they advocate bigger government programs to do the caring and feeding. To sum up the difference between liberal compassion and true compassion, I’ll borrow an old saying: “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.”  (If “Jesus was a liberal", as Jackson says, I wonder what he’d have to say about the other attributes of liberalism, such as sexual permissiveness, advocating homosexual “marriage", killing unborn babies or discriminating against people based on their race.)  While I believe non-political conservative values, such as promoting traditional families, self-restraint, self-reliance (physical, not spiritual), to name a few, are biblical attributes, I don’t dispute that some liberals mean well when they contend that feeding the hungry just because they’re hungry is what Jesus would do. It is true, but not the way they think.  As Jackson knows, liberal, conservative, libertarian, constitutionalist, etc., are labels we fallen humans came up with to describe our political ideology. Labels are just a quick way to describe where we are on an imaginary political line.   In that regard, I’ll dispense with political labels and use spiritual ones: believers, unbelievers, saved and unsaved. According to the Bible, which I believe is inerrant, infallible and God-breathed, we are dead in our sins. That is, we are incapable of recognizing the need for salvation. From the first disobedience in the Garden of Eden, every person born is a sinner. We are rebels through and through.  But a person is “saved” from God’s wrath once he’s acknowledged his sinful condition, confessed his sins, admitted his unworthiness and turns away from his sins. He’s asked God for mercy and forgiveness and acknowledged the need of a Savior: Christ crucified on the cross. In all of these things the repentent person has faith, and in his infinite mercy, God forgives. Read more here.  Jesus did many things in his 3-year ministry. With righteous indignation, he threw out traders and money-changers conducting business in God’s temple, fed the hungry and cared for and about the downtrodden. But that’s not all he did or ultimately why he came.   This is where the unbelieving miss a crucial point. Christ wasn’t a traveling doctor or soup kitchen volunteer walking about the countryside curing ailments and filling bellies with loaves of bread and fish. He was extending an offer to heal spiritual sickness and provide the bread of life — Himself — to satisfy spiritual hunger. The portrait of a “liberal” Jesus misses these points entirely.  Christ indeed fed the poor. The poor in spirit. Christ said, “I am the bread of life….Your forefathers ate the manna in the desert, yet they died. But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which a man may eat and not die. I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever.”   Some people don’t believe that Jesus was anything other than a man. They say Jesus was a good teacher, a wise philosopher and an all-around great guy but ignore the fact that this “good teacher” claimed to be the Son of God. He claimed authority to judge sin, not merely to point it out. Such authority is given to no mere man. In his boldness, Christ told the unbelieving Jews that if they indeed knew God, they’d also know him because he and God were one. He even claimed to be the “I AM” himself, the name of the God of the Old Testament. Jesus is also the Lamb slain to pay for the sins of those he came to save. He will return to deliver God’s wrath on an unrepentant world. Isn’t it interesting that people who claim Jesus was a liberal skip over this part?  I certainly didn’t expect Jesse Jackson to say all this in a 650-word column, but a little hint would have been nice.  To heal our spiritual sickness and hunger is why Christ came into the world, and I pray that Jesse Jackson knows it. If he really believes that the God of the Bible approves of deception and deliberate misapplication of Scripture, I truly feel sorry for him. A man who once believed abortion was murder has let his political ambition take precedence over truth.  This is compassion: I pray that God has mercy on him.   netpilot:  Again, here are the points from the Sermon on the Mount which I mentioned in my previous post.  "Blessed are the meek. Blessed are the peacemakers. Agree with your adversary quickly. Turn the other cheek. Give to him who asks you and from him who wants to borrow from you do not turn away. Love your enemies. Judge not."  Let's take this more toward the Iraqi conflict and foreign policy instead of soup kitchens. That was my intention anyhow.  But even then, there is nothing spiritual about 'Give to him who asks you and from him who wants to borrow from you do not turn away.' In this instance, the woman who wrote the article is guilty of the same mistake made by Jesse. She's picking and choosing the parts of his teachings that fit into her worldview.  But... the question I asked has not been addressed. Are these teachings still relevant and do they still apply to today's world? Are they still doable or are they naive?   Trish:  We must keep any particular faith/spiritual path/religion (fill in the blank here) from having overriding influence. To think those in government have no beliefs let alone that they have no influence is delusional at best. But there is a huge difference between practicing a personal faith through action and speech (as most are called to do within their particular path), and forcefeeding it to others through whatever means.   Boileryard Clarke:  I can't answer for La Shawn - and she wouldn't need that anyhow. Also the subject was well done and heavily attended at her blog, but I can give my take on an answer. Also I would prefer we stay to soup kitchens, but netpilot has taken it to the realm of foreign policy. So here we go.  It should be noted that La Shawn and I, while Christians, have our own interpretations of things. So I only answer net for myself when I say...  We're also to give to Ceasar what is his and to God what is His.  And whether or not we are talking about soup kitchens or foreign policy, Jesse's worldview or La Shawn's worldview, or for that matter netpilot's worldview, my contention is that the virtues expressed by Jesus in that sermon - and in His entire teachings - are the sources of inspiration and understandings directed toward the paradigms that order each individual's relation to all else.   But in that it may instruct policy MUST be another matter, for in a society that attempts to order and accomodate the various religions within the same borders as we do in America, we have to keep an eye out to the imposition of one set of teachings over another.   And in any case if we found the truest expression of the Buddha there would be no borders, no power centers, no armies, and no more Buddhists either.  But Islam's paradigm would swallow the sermon on the mount whole, as "fighting is proscribed for you" intones the notion that here we have a relgion and a version of God that admits to man's penchant for conflict. Islam attempts to temper that penchant by saying when a man cries for peace it is righteous to give peace, but if he fights - keep fighting him. Check your response here, my fellows - in my travels I studied the Qu-ran and was very close to conversion at one point. I'm not giving the standard American street-corner vitriol here.  There is no "turn the other cheek" to offense in Islam once the intent of your opponent is clearly seen as your ruin. There is only tempering response when the other guy cries "uncle." In Christianity it may seem that gracefulness comes at the point of being attacked, while in Islam it comes when your enemy asks for you to have it. This is a huge chasm. And it does not take into account - at any time - the idea that there could possibly be people who are using the knowledge that you won't defend yourself in order to take what you have and what you are - because they didn't buy the lessons and/or you forgot that it is a metaphor.  The point of my silly comparison is as an answer to your question of the teaching's relevence to today's world. Are they? Yes they are - but to the degree they contain (or appear to contain) the seeds of one's own eventual destruction, then you have to ask - was that the intent of the lesson?   netpilot:  Boileryard - I realize I'm running the risk of having this devolve into a theological discussion, but I would have to disagree with your reference to metaphor.   I see nothing metaphorical about what I referenced, pretty straight-forward stuff.  But I sure wish we could all go back to my original post and address the points I brought up there.    urlLink La Shawn Barber:    netpilot says: "She's picking and choosing the parts of his teachings that fit into her worldview."  I am "she", and I'm not sure what I'm picking and choosing, if you could be more explicit. I jumped in mid-discussion so I need to get caught up.  In the meantime, you mentioned the Sermon on the Mount. If you have the time, check out a post I wrote about the war from a biblical worldview,  urlLink "Onward, Christian Soldiers."  I look forward to the discussion. Have your Bibles handy!  ---------------------------  That's where we ended as of this writing. As I said - posting rules are waived.

      We are now to be inundated with the latest chapter of the "America Is An Evil Monster" saga, this time related to Sudan and the massive bloodletting and starvation being visited upon the Darfuris. The genocide practiced on the mostly Christian, black farmers of Sudan for a solid decade at the hands of a renegade Muslim government in Khartoum will now be exposed by the Left as America's fault - even if that Islamic regime has been on-and-off an avowed enemy of the US and tacit accomplice to al Qaida and such other Muslim Supremacists.    The first installmet comes from the Australian  urlLink Green Left Weekly , wherein we shall find that the problems these people are facing isn't because their government in Africa is making them a victim, but that "Western governments are allowing more than 2000 hungry and sick Darfuris to die every single day for want of urgently needed food, medicines and shelter."  If anyone need be reminded of the problems with Relative Morality, they should note that this kind of argument is what comes of it. The blame does not lie with the people inflicting the wound, it lies with those who aren't fixing it.   Oh but there is more... you can count on it...   The article in that august publication, which conveniently ties itself linkwise to varied socialist publications all claiming to be giving the unhindered truth to the public so poorly informed by the corporate mouthpieces of the US government like ABC, CBS, and CNN (insert rolling eyes here), goes on to upbraid America, President Bush, and anyone close by.  It states "Despite the huge numbers of aircraft and vehicles that the West can mobilise to wage deadly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, just a handful of Western aircraft have been made available for relief operations in Sudan."   If you were to make an argument that they may also be led to say - if we did divert tons of resources there - that we were only doing the humanitarian thing because of the oil, do you think you would have a point?  Well... you don't even really have to wait for that. The article expresses the fact that the money called for relief has not been forthcoming, the West’s lack of response, or more exactly it's "callous response to the humanitarian crisis in Darfur starkly illustrates that for Washington and the EU, Darfuris are mere pawns in the power play to get Western access to the oil profits flowing out of southern Sudan."  If anyone else senses the typical "let's have it both ways" argument so well-honed by the Left coming up here, speak now or forever hold your peace. Not that they'll take notice of the critique or anything...  But it gets better.  An online publication dedicated to the troubles in Sudan  urlLink located here  gives us information about those people in the world who have sent something very important to Sudan in the past few days: China. As in troops. Not to feed people.   But to protect China's oil interests in the southern part of the country... where there are a lot of Darfuris.  It says "The people of Darfur are being forgotten by US policy makers" - then tells us how "While Washington has begged the world -- and pressured the United Nations Security Council -- to send peacekeeping troops to Sudan to quell the sectarian fighting that has put a million refugees at risk, China has already deployed 4,000 troops to Sudan. But those troops are there only to protect China's investment in an oil pipeline. China is concerned that civil unrest could wreck the oil project. It has actually been hostile to U.S. pressure to impose economic sanctions on the Arab government in Khartoum, a key Chinese client, buyer of Chinese arms and partner in oil exploration."  China is doing this because "Just 10 years ago, China was self-sufficient in oil and actually exported small quantities to other Asian nations. Now, imports account for more than one- third of Chinese oil consumption. And rather than relying on foreign oil companies to supply it with oil, China wants its own oil firms to go directly overseas to secure supply sources it can exploit itself."   But it's the US who has forgotten the Darfuris. It's US policy that is hypocritical. It is US leadership, and the  WEST  that is using the horrors in Sudan to their advantage.  But we're still too much into our "bloody wars in Iraq and Afghanistan" to lend a hand.  The Left gives a pass to China's supreme self-serving and careless moving of 4000 actual, real-life, in-the-flesh troops to the region to protect their oil interests. But it is because the US is doing nothing or not enough that this is all about oil.  You know what I'd like to say right about here?  Well I won't - but I have another question...  urlLink Where are Africa's Leaders In This ?

      netpilot had to actually go do work for his job last week and so the time span that covered an area of discussion (plus the nature of blog pages) is making the subject more  quickly recede into web-history than we need it to right now. So I am reviving the topic here.  I posted a link to  urlLink La Shawn Barber's Corner  and an article on a subject that ties into comments net has made many times here and elsewhere as to the relativity of the meanings of the lessons of Christianity in today's world.   So I want to re-up the discussion for those who can't get enough of the religio-philo-socio-politico worldview thing.  Not that that kind of thing really matters - as it only defines every last one of us. But anyway... netpilot answered La Shawn's  urlLink "Jesus Was A Liberal"  article by saying...    "Again, here are the points from the Sermon on the Mount which I mentioned in my previous post.  " 'Blessed are the meek. Blessed are the peacemakers. Agree with your adversary quickly.

If LaShawn decided to answer we'd be honored, but there are also a good many looks at this topic in what is covered at her site.

      I've been following Christopher Allbritton's coverage of Iraq for over 2 years now. He was the first (to my knowledge) to allow readers to be so involved with journalism.  Those of us who caught him early on were offered the chance to sponsor him and in return be allowed first glimpses on his freelance stories before publication, and some stories that were exclusive to his  urlLink website .   Today's post is a prime example.  Currently in Iraq covering the war for TIME,  urlLink Chris offered a combination  of what he calls 'outtakes' of his interview with interim Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allwai, along with the official interview published in TIME (with TIME's permission).  Reading both makes fascinating reading...

          Christopher Preble, Director of Foreign Policy Studies at the  urlLink Cato Institute  spearheaded a task force of nine to present a concise work of 71 pages in typical Cato style. Clear. Crisp. To the point.  Not as strident as what one may find from the  urlLink Mises Institute  or  urlLink Lew Rockwell  to be sure, the critique of the action in Iraq from Cato nevertheless constitutes an address of the issue from the Right, rather than the usual partisan hacksterisms of the Left.   Basing the report on four conclusions drawn by the team, each conclusion is given a summary in semi-chapter form. The tenets of the piece can be summarized by saying that a long term occupation of Iraq is not in America's best interests nor is it anything but counter-productive in the War On Terror. It will cost a lot of money and democracy in the Middle East is a fantasy.  I found myself at odds with some of the presumptions. There is a small twist-up of whether or not the Administration actually connected Hussein with 9/11. Everything I've read has President Bush saying (more than once) there was never any evidence to connect Hussein with 9/11. The smoke about the issue comes from Wolfowitz and Cheney, who kept up the hint about it, but never made the direct statement (so far as I could find). Be that as it may - and at the risk of overdrawing this account - though there were no direct ties between Hussein and bin Laden, there was a tacit non-aggression agreement. Though the task force does not fall into the usual leftist mistake of saying the Bush White House involved itself in a "unilateral" action, it does seem to forget that there are 30 nations counted up as members of the coalition in one form or another. And that democracy can't work in the Middle East, more specifically in Iraq, is an opinion. It is an educated opinion, but it also smacks a wee bit of Western condescension.   That said it should be noted that other, more exacting, observations outweigh the smaller issues that can honestly be debated. There is, for example, no compelling  argument forthcoming from the administration as to why, exactly, a democratic Iraq would be a boon to the War on Terror. In point of fact the presence of foreign troops in Iraq is acting as an aid to the recruitment of future terrorists, drawing resources and talent away from the destruction of al Qaida and the longer we stay the deeper will be the conviction amongst the men in the streets of Islam that the government in place is a puppet and we really are there for the oil after all. In this case it wouldn't matter what the truth is, and people who blithely argue that the "hearts and minds" of these people is of no concern to us are forgetting that we need people to  buy in  to democracy or we're there for decades. And that would be disaster.  I am more uncomfortable with the notion the book puts on the table that "A Democratic Middle East Is A Chimera." An illusion it could be, a phantom it probably is - but all democracy is tenuous no matter where it is located. Democracy is fragile because it is easier not to think, simpler to just react, more direct and less messy to allow the Leadership Principle instead of suffrage make the call. And part of me recoils just a bit at the idea that suggests that some people may not be capable of running a democracy. My mistrust of the sentiment is modified by the fact that the book is addressing the issuance of "democracy at gunpoint" and exactly relates the correct assessment of ethnic and tribal and religious differences, but there is just the slightest hint of White Man's Burden in the background.   I won't spoil the ending. The final chapter "How We Get Out" addresses all the proper concerns. The risk of civil war. The ethnic divisions. Our expectations. The potential power void, and what may fill it. How to explain ourselves.  The gripping conclusion to a complex condition.   Probably ignored by those who could use it most - but a must-read for Yarders.   I recommend  Exiting Iraq
