      Wow.  Wow.  I have really burned the candle on both ends for this one.  Seriously - even more than that time in college I stayed up four consecutive days to finish three papers, then fell asleep during my midterm exam (in mid-sentence, no less).  Taking care of a new baby, working box at the MET, holding down my day job at the Pasadena Playhouse and directing this show have been like my own private Scott Farnsworth and his toady coming up behind me and pulling my arm back until I scream "uncle".  However, I am proud to report that the songs are done, the show is blocked, and I couldn't be happier with the progress we've made.  I warn everyone who plans to see this show: this cast is funny.  I've seen these scenes a hundred times already, and they still manage to crack me up every time.  We've had to work around another show using our rehearsal space, the director needing to work box, people's vacation schedules, blah blah blah... and with all that chaos, we're still going to deliver the best damned show this town has ever seen come the 9th.  God, I love the theater.  I also warn you: make reservations now.  We're already getting some reservations for opening night, and we're still two weeks out - normally at the MET we don't start seeing any reservations at all until the week of.  I've never seen us filled to the point that we had to turn people away, but it might happen this run.  Just don't let it happen to you.  Anyway, I'll try to be more regular with my blogs, and also try not to wig out on anyone this coming tech weekend.  Cya, Joe

      Read this week's edition of the LA Weekly.  Not only does it include a very nice review for the current MET Theatre production of "Patty Cake" directed by Flint Esquerra and starring our very own Laura Caputo (voted "MET Member you'd most like to see wearing nothing but a sheet"), but it also contained one of the most engaging articles I've read in a long time, Steven Leigh Morris's "...Or Not to Be."  Read it here:   http://www.laweekly.com/ink/04/31/features-morris.php  I've been interested in this story even before I first started seeing the ridiculous billboards on Sunset, since I frequent Birds and I see the front of the Tamarind quite a bit.  Like everyone else, I smelled a giant turd of a vanity project and I found myself rubbernecking every time I heard new developments... someone spending 35 grand for a single billboard, then getting 12 of them, then putting his face on the side of busses, giving himself a 2-page glossy spread in the program... it was truly heroic in its proportions.  Of course, the shame in all of this is that in this bustling, vibrant burg of theater we all live in, where there is more theater going on every week than New York City and London  combined , where thousands of nameless actors, designers, directors, writers and technicians toil in complete anonymity, where every week people you've never heard of deliver performances that blow away every Oscar winner of the past 15 years, the thing that everyone hears about is this jackass throwing some money around and dragging one of the cornerstones of English literature through the sewer.  Seriously - if our local papers devoted this much ink every week to some of the positive things going on in the theater scene, maybe we'd have an easier time letting people know what we're doing.    Of course, it's not all their fault... like I said, I watched the train wreck alongside everyone else, and I guess when you put up billboards proclaiming your coolness, you're pretty much putting a target on your back.  Take a moment to imagine this, though: what if there were that much money and enthusiasm behind a project that was actually worthwhile?  Can you imagine how nice it would be to see something you were proud of advertised on the front page of the LA Weekly?  Well, we're working on it.  I know I'm a bit biased, but I can honestly say that I've never worked on a show like this - we've got so many people who are so passionate about this show, and who also happen to  be great at what they do... and it's not just the normal stuff.  It's the web design, the marketing, the graphics.. I feel so proud of this show, and I hope our work on the stage will live up to everything that's been heralding us.  -Joe

      So, it's a dark day for LA sports - Shaquille O'Neal is all but officially on his way out of town, headed for Dallas.  It got me to thinking - what if the U. S. handled its changes of power like the NBA?  Imagine: we sit down with the current administration and have a closed-door meeting, then issue a press release afterwards that goes something like this -   "Four years ago, we took a gamble and drafted a mostly untested rookie out of Texas.  We decided to overlook some personal issues in his past because he answered some fundamental holes we needed to address if we were going to return to championship form (mostly, he didn't screw around on his wife).  He met with some success early, and got us through some tough times.  However, we've decided that our franchise and Mr. Bush will have to part ways following this season - we are sending him to Seattle for Ralph Nader, John McCain, and a Representative to be named later."  "Mostly, we need someone who can hit a free throw."  -Joe

      So, I've noticed a trend.  I've consistently gained weight doing shows.  It's an established fact:  Pirates of Penzance - 11 pounds.  A Midsummer Night's Dream - 8 pounds the first time, 12 pounds the second time.  The Question - 15 pounds.  It's becoming an epidemic, especially since the MET is within easy walking distance of Mickey D's, Burger King and The Bell.  add to this the surety of skipping meals during marathon days of build, rehearsal, and box, and I'm starting to resemble Michael Moore's good twin.    So, I've resolved that this time around will be the first time on record (and the first time since early high school) when I will have a net loss over a span of time.  No, it's not for the career - obviously, no one cares if you're a fatass when you're a director, or Mr. Moore would still be doing stop-motion Play-Doh cartoons and telling his mom he's going to move out any day now.  It's not for the chicks - Mrs. Beck is probably the coolest chick to ever walk the earth - not jealous, lets me watch sports, doesn't get jealous in the least - but even she would be hard-pressed to be cool with the newly-sveldte me suddenly cruising the Strip in a convertible with a few hoochie mamas hanging over the sides.  No, I'm doing this for the future, because I had a vision.  I'm in Ralph's.  I'm debating between Fruit Loops and Cocoa Puffs (both of which are on sale for $2.50 a box) and I see this dude wheeling around in a Rascal.  Not an old guy, not a guy who needed Larry H. Parker to get him 2.1 million... just a huge, fat guy.  I'm not talking fat like "man, you're porking out there" kind of fat - I'm talking crane-to-get-you-into-bed-entire-show-dedicated-to-you-guest-on-GERALDO fat. And it occurs to me, ten years ago this guy's probably buying his Cocoa Puffs, racing back home to catch the series premiere of The X-Files, and thinking how much it would rule if he got to scoot around in an electric wheelchair instead of having to schlep himself from place to place.  In a moment of clarity, I see Toucan Sam and The Cuckoo Guy for what they are - harbingers of death.  I stumble backwards and grab the nearest box that has something to do with oat bran.  So, there it is.  The gauntlet is thrown.  My goal is negative ten pounds by opening.  Wish me luck.  -Joe

      The quest: find actors for roles that don't exist.  Figure out who you need, who you don't need, what you need them for - all without a definite dramatis personae.  Cast a show that's not done yet.    That's what I was presented with when the writer and I woke up in puddles of our own drool after our celebratory "We're in PRIMETIME" binge of narcotics and prostitutes and realized that we were now less than five weeks away from opening and hadn't done any work on the show.  So, he started writing, and I put out the call.  We saw many - some we knew, some we didn't, most were awesome.  I know that directors tell you this all the time, but I sincerely wanted to work with everyone I saw.  If you're an actor, I highly recommend working on a project in a capacity which lets you sit in on some auditions.  The first time I auditioned people, it completely changed how I looked at the process when I auditioned for others.  It's true - everyone at the table is rooting for you - they're hoping that they will see you and not want to see anyone else because you completely blow their minds.    In the end, we ended up with a cast that I am so proud of, I can't put it into words without sounding like an R. Kelly song.    I'm now about to head into the thick of it with a talented but largely untested cast, working with a script no one has yet seen, framed for a crime they didn't commit.  If you're in trouble, if you need help, and if you can find them, maybe you should hire.... the EOA Team.  Late, Joe

      I was a pilgrim in an unholy land: a conservative in the entertainment industry.  I'd attend functions where my friends and colleagues would bitch about the NEA and gun control, and I'd simply nod blankly and hold my tongue like Oscar Schindler.  I'd walk into theaters and see the "Liberals Only" signs on the bathrooms, and the signs that said "Conservatives" pointing out back to the alleyway, and I wondered if I could feel any more marginalized.  Then I read a script.  It was funny.  It was interesting.  It was topical.  It poked fun at someone who I'd hoped would be defeated in the 1999 primary so I could feel good about voting for a Republican.  (Instead of a McCain/Bradley campaign in which both candidates could pronounce all the words in their speeches AND not put me to sleep with them, I was treated to Bush/Gore, which was like the Spurs/Nets NBA final last year - utterly unwatchable.  I mean honestly, if there hadn't been that whole hanging chad thing, that election would have gone down in history somewhere between the results from the fourth "Survivor" and the breakup of Deep Blue Something.)  So, I asked if I could direct it, figuring I could just give it my best shot and then move on.  But fate had a different idea.  It caught fire like Michael Jackson's bangs.  People came to see it at MIDNIGHT in December.  It was funny.  The cast and crew were amazing.  We made all kinds of green for the theater.  They wanted another installment.  So we did another one, and it was even bigger than the first - most likely because this one was at 11:30, making it that much easier for people to see.  This time we got critics to show up, and it was like watching the shots from the "We Are the World" video where the starving people are opening up sacks of wheat (ever wonder about that?  If I were starving and someone gave me a bunch of wheat, I'd be pissed off.  What, you couldn't give me PROCESSED food?  I only warrant RAW INGREDIENTS??  Thanks a LOT, Stevie Wonder.).  Best of all, we used people in new roles and found that we had an extremely talented and dedicated corp of actors.  We made more dough for the theater.  Then the batphone rang - they wanted another one, this time bigger than the first.  This time, we would be in PRIME TIME, and we needed to step up and deliver like never before.  After a grueling and extremely constuctive workshop process, here we are, auditioning for another piece of Los Angeles political satire heaven, on the verge of rehearsals and looking for new and exciting ways to get people in to see it.    Among them, this blog.  I will be checking in regularly, giving updates and commentary on events both in the show and around the world.  Hopefully it will be interesting enough to come back to the site, and maybe tell a few of your friends.  In any case, thanks for reading and I'll see you soon.  -Joe

      So, Lance Armstrong just won his sixth consecutive Tour de France.&nbsp; Personally, the athletic accomplishment is completely overshadowed by the fact that an American went to France, played their game, and beat them six straight - there hasn't been this righteous of a beatdown since Henry Gondorff beat Doyle Lonigan with those four Jacks.&nbsp; Pure joy.  So, we're contemplating EoA4, moving into the final week of production of EoA3, and, as usual, I'm waxing philosophical.&nbsp; I'm immensely proud of the work we've done, the response it's getting from audiences, the joy I see in the actor's faces on and off stage... it's made me realize something about Lance.&nbsp; I always wonder how he can ride 1,099,092 miles on his bike, then go home and start training for the next year's race right away without even a stop at Wattaburger.&nbsp; I think it's all about that final ride into Paris, when you know you've done the work, you're wearing the yellow jersey, and (non-French) people are throwing flowers in your path.&nbsp; That's where I am right now, and while the prospect of putting up another one of these before the election in November is daunting, the thought of people approaching me in the lobby and saying "this made me look at a lot of things I hadn't considered before," the thought of seeing Eric as Lincoln berating the audience, the thought of dressing up Chane't as Al Sharpton, the thought of Jesus acting as GW's lawyer at a Senate hearing... those are mighty happy thoughts.  Thanks for making this a fun ride, everyone.&nbsp; My ass is sore, but my heart is light. -Joe

      The title of this post, if you haven't yet seen the show, refers to Dick Cheney's final line.  The image I gave Barbara was that of Carrie's hand emerging from the grave at the end of the movie, that "just when you thought it was over" thing.... and that's exactly how I feel right now.  After steering this ship through tech week, which was akin to taking a schooner through the Straights of Magellan in November, the resulting opening night revelries and the calm of not having rehearsals and shows is more refreshing than any Sprite commercial could capture.    So, given that amount of intense crapshower and the shock of relaxation, you'd think I'd need a few months to recharge my batteries.  But no, we're already talking about EoA4 which would immediately preceed the election, which would mean we'd have to start rehearsals..... in about five minutes.  Following that, I'm directing The Merchant of Venice here at the MET.  Oh, and I attended a reading of a play I'm workshopping and directing sometime in the next year.  And people are approaching me to direct other things in the coming year.  More sailing, more schooners, more straights.  SHOTGUN!

      I hope everyone's Fourth was Glorious - Lord knows mine was, as we chilled out, did some laundry, got some random work done, and rolled over to a fabulous barbecue/pool party with our friends Jim and Cari.    Am I the only one who thinks twice about swimming in a pool after several random children have used it?  Does it gross anyone else out to think of paddling around in a bunch of kid pee?  'Cause you KNOW they do it - you can't ask them not to.  Might as well ask Anna Kournikova to win a tennis tournament, or ask Bill Clinton not to hit on trashy women.  I almost managed a full day of chill without getting a phone call about the show, but it was not to be.  That was all right, though, since I had to do some work on the show, anyway.  Besides, after this week my sole duty will be to sell tickets and tally sheets - all the hard work for me is done after Thursday evening.  There's something very very gratifying for me when I turn a show over to a stage manager - kind of like completing the circle.  I really don't understand directors who have to step in and give notes after every performance - for me, the joy is in seeing it take a life of its own.  Great, now I'm hearing Cat Stevens in my head - "Find a girl, settle down... if you want to, you can marry...".  Anyway, we're still plugging along, bringing the strands of this ridiculously complex show together - complex in a technical/theatrical way, not intellectually - and doing a damned good job at it, I might add.  Of course, Stanislavsky said "no matter how long you rehearse, you always need two more weeks," and he rehearsed for like two years with the Moscow Art Theatre before they performed.  Come this weekend, and you'll see.  Hope to see you there.  I'm planning on checking in all this week - so make your reservations now, so I can greet you with a confident smile next time.  Otherwise, I might have to pawn my wife's ancestral china.  I warned you.  -Joe
