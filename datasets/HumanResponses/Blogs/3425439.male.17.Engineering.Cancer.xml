      I don't get how even though I am happier than I have ever been, no one can be happy for me. No one seems to be capable of sympathy, no one seems to be capable of caring for someone else. There are only a few people that can truly be happy for someone just because they are happy. Last August I weighed 169lbs, and I was 5'5". Now I am 5'7" and I only weigh 145lbs. Yet, I still have people that call me fat and tell me I have man-titties. I really pisses me off for how insensitive some people can be, most actually. Anyway, I guess my basic purpose for this is that I am happy in my relationship and so is my partner, yet everyone I now gives me a hard time. If her and I can handle a difference of 1700 miles and still be happy, then why can't anyone be happy for us? Or even if they can't be happy, at least keep their opinions to themselves? It's horrible. Really.  Not a lot has happened really. Allie told me last night to go fuck some other girl If I want to. I can't believe she would even do that. And she didn't mean it as "break up with me and fuck her if you want to", she meant "stay with me, fuck her, and then come back to me". I love Allie so much, but that's one of her few flaws. She doesn't have enough respect for herself. She should respect herself. She is, by far, the best person I have ever met, and I am lucky to have her. She just doesn't see it that way. She shouldn't take people's shit. And I know I give her my fair share of it, but I am really trying my best not to hurt her. ::sighs::  On a lighter note, I am passing all of my classes. I passed my Final in Algebra with 100%. I bombed my English final, and I am going to ace my Spanish final Monday. Seems ass-backwards, doesn't it? Failing English and passing Spanish? I only have two days of school left, Monday and Tuesday. Monday I have two exams, then Tuesday is a bullshit day. It's basically to make sure that we are in school the appropriate amount of time. That's it really. I am debating whether or not I'm going Tuesday. If I can work, I won't go to school. But if I can't go to work, then I will go to school Tuesday. I need the money, so I hope I can work.  This entry is becoming tedious, I'll bore you all some more later. I love you all, most likely at least. It mostly depends on who you are. Bye

      Well, today was very uneventful. I sat at home, alone, Watching movies. And not just for a little while. I mean all day. I talked to Allie for maybe 10 minutes around 1:00 p.m. I chatted with people on the internet. More people gave me shit about my relationship. JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!!! Fuck faces! I wish people would stop riding my dick, i'm not that fucking great.   Anyway, I watched  The Client , a movie adapted from the John Grisham novel. It was really good. It's about a little boy (11 years old) who is the witness to a suicide. But not only was he a witness, the guy tried to kill the kid also. But first he told the kid a lot of things about the mob. So the mob is after him to keep him quiet, and the cops are after him to put the mob boss in jail.   Then I watched  Adaptation . That was very confusing, and freaky. Nicholas Cage played two brothers, both screen-writers, both living in the same apartment. It confused the living shit out of me. I am still not sure what it's about. It was really hard to follow, nicholas cage's characters both looked exactly the same except for clothes.  I am talking to Allie right now. She is having trouble breathing. I hope she's alright. ::ish worried::  bye everyone. I love you Allie.

      Well, nothing to update on. Just commenting on my own new template. I was bored. I uploaded one of my favorite songs on here. Added a "Daily perplexity question" section, and put a chatterbox on. I am going to change my header eventually, when I can figure out how. And then I am thinking about changing my background. But background changes are usually bad. It'll make my text harder to read. Anywho, more template editing later. Goodbye all!

      Well, yesterday was pretty simple. I don't really know how else to explain it. I had a really odd reaction to a not-so-common nightmare last night. It wasn't even really all that scary, but I lost two hours of sleep over it and woke up in a cold sweat. Allie was down here, and she wouldn't let me touch her, kiss her, hugg her, or even be near her. She would barely talk with me. I woke up in a cold sweat because of that dream, and didn't fall back asleep for two hours. Isn't that such a simple dream? Yet I lost sleep over it. I have never lost sleep over a dream before. Even that one time that Allie turned into a lobster-monster and dismembered me I fell right back asleep. Anywho, today was pretty confusing. I skipped every class I had today, yet I was at school the entire time. I went from room to room with friends, playing guitar, gamecube, and cards. Did absolutely nothing constructive. Out of 2,700 students, there was probably only 250 of us actually at school. Tomorrow is going to blow. I work form 7:00am until 3:30 pm. Then I go back to Work at 8:00pm and won't be home form work until 2:00am. It's cool though, that's $98,00 in my pocket.....err....the bank. Anyway, nothing much else to say. I'll update when I am not tired or when I actually have something of interest or importance to say. Bye everyone, love ya.

      Well, school Tuesday was bullshit. but I think I already said that. I worked in the ghetto yesterday doing fire damage cleanup. It wasn't too bad, except it was hot as fuck out. And my hands have chemical burns all over them. They're all shiny and getting ready to peel. I did the same thing today, at the same house. We finished. I also got a raise today. I am not making $8.00/hour. Two years and two dollars more an hour isn't bad. That's $320.00 a week before taxes. But I only get social security out. So, whatever. But it looks like my car will be on the road by the end of June at this rate, and I will also be able to paint it soon there-after. I have to scrub the floors at a condiminium tomorrow, but i'll be done there by noon. Tomorrow is an easy day so everyone has time to get where they are going for the holiday weekend. Allie is going to Dorney tomorrow. I hope she has a lot of fun. I'm trying to make plans with anybody so I don't sit here at home bored off my ass. I need to make some phone calls. Let's see......I don't think there is really anything else, other than today is Allie and mine's 4th lunaversary. And tomorrow is our 2nd lunaversary....sorta. Don't ask. I added two counters at the bottom of my page. Like them? Cya all later. Love you allie!! :)

      The day was pretty good. I went to my grandmother's in Homosassa Springs. I ended up brigning Gene with me. We rode mopeds, got yelled at by the scooter nazi because we were 30 mph over the speed limit ( and I don't think he liked us going off road because we are cooler than him), played video games, shot pool ( I want a pool table badly, but we have no room), ate hotdogs, and watched t.v..  I really wouldn't mind going back up there, but I have to bring Gene again. The drive up there wasn't bad. I drove, so I picked most of the music. ::waves hands around in the Wu-tang symbol:: Wu-tang clan aint nuttin' to fuck wit'! Heh heh. Immortal technique is now probably one of my favorite rappers. He's intelligent as all hell, raps quite well, and isn't afraid to expose the truth.  Politically controversial?.....very much so. http://www.ohhla.com/anonymous/immortal/ rev_vol2/cause_of.tch.txt  Made me fucking shiver at the end. http://www.ohhla.com/anonymous/immortal/ rev_vol2/younever.tch.txt  Then the night sucked, because I was really mad at Allie for some things. It seems that the more I show I care, the less she cares. plus she is really rude when it comes to Grace. I talked to her for ten minutes friday night, Grace calls. She puts me on hold for 20 minutes while she talked to Grace. I was getting fed up and wanted to just hang up, but I couldn't hang up on her. My phone started dieing. So, there it was. I left then. It hurts that she would just comepletely drop a call with me just because Grace called. and it hurts even more that she didn't have the courtesy to let me now it was going to be a 45 minute phone call. And she is really introverted. I didn't mean it as a threat, or as an ultimatum, or even to scare her. But I told her that I can't be in a relationhip were someone won't share how they feel, whether it be good or bad. Well, after I let everything out, I was really quiet for a while. But then we started talking, she told me how her day was, I told her how mine was. All the basic things. I started teasing her. It's 1:30. Next thing we know it is 3:30 and we have no clue where the time went. Well, we do. We just can't believe it lasted so long. Then 4 rolls around and next thing we know it is 4:45. After that, I made her go to bed. She had to be up at 9 for church. grrr. I hope she got enough sleep. She should take a nap later today anyway. I'm probably going to change the song on here to one of those two above. I think I am going to stop showing my feelings a little bit for Allie and see if she will realize what she is doing to me by acting like she doesn't love me anymore.  Anywho, by everyone. Love you all.

      Well, I havn't updated in a while. I guess not a whole lot has happened lately. I had Monday off (duh) and then I had Tuesday off. I had to work Wednesday for a little bit. Then Thursday I had off again. Firday I worked. When I got home, I called Allie. We talked for maybe two minytes and she had to leave for the dude ranch. She told me that she had fun, she only got back 45 minutes ago. The weekend was hell without her. I couldn't concentrate on  anything . I bought some new bag gloves and hand wraps on Friday. Then Gene spent the night Saturday, which I have to thank him for. He occupied my time. He couldn't get my mind off of Allie, but he tried which is the point. Allie is ignoring the hell out of me on AIM. Hope she isn't like this tonight. But whatever. I can't blame her for being tired. I think her AIM is acting up also. But yeah. Other than that, not much has happened. Nothing to really say anything about. I am going to start my training for Scuba Diving next Saturday. So, I will be a certified diver by the end of June. My birthday is getting closer. I will have enough money soon to get insurance, a paint job, and some parts for my car. I'm really all over the place tonight. I have no will left to organize my thoughts. Goodbye everyone, until next time. Love you all. If anyone actually  does  read this.
