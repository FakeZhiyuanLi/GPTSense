       urlLink     Can You Keep a Secret?   by Sophie Kinsella     Genre:  Chick Lit/Romantic Comedy   Rating (worst 1; best 5):  4   Review:   Sophie Kinsella has done it again.  The main character, Emma, leaves no reminiscences of Becky of the  Shopaholic  books.  Also told in the first person, this book is hilarious and kept me laughing through and through.  (The truth is, I picked up the book to read a little bit and never put it down.  By the time I finished, it was morning and I never even realized how late, or early rather, it was)  On its own, I really enjoyed the book, although slightly far fetched.  Emma has a pretty okay life.  She works as an advertising assistant, has a great, adoring boyfriend, and has a genius for a best friend.  However, she has a few secrets, like all of us do.  One of them happens to be a fear of flying.  Upon returning from a failed business meeting which might have given her the promotion she had been looking for, her flight hits some major turbulence and people are being bumped and scratched and thrown upward.  In a complete panic, Emma turns to the man next to her and blurts out every secret she could ever have.  She doesn't even finish by the time a flight attendant tells her they've landed.  Emma realizes a few things--she doesn't feel really loved by her parents, she's not in love with her boyfriend.  Emma tries to go on like the whole thing never happened, but then finds out that the man she told all her secrets to...well, he founded the company she works at and he's come to visit the company.  And to top it off, this man remembers each and every one of Emma's secrets.  Romance, hilarity, and drama ensues.  So much happens, that that small summary barely does the story justice.  The only thing I thought might have been missing was character development.  In Kinsella's  Shopaholic  books, you felt you knew each of the characters, but in  Secret , each character is a little less, how shall I say..."revealed" to the reader.  Nonetheless, I loved the book and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good laugh.

       urlLink     The Devil in the White City:  Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair that Changed America   by Erik Larson     Genre:  History   Rating (worst 1; best 5):  4   Review:   Now, don't let the History genre scare you away.  This book is very entertaining because of the way Erik Larson describes situations.  He embeds real citations within storytelling, but the storytelling is true.  When reading this, one must keep it mind that this is all truth, and no fiction.  The book tells the tale of how the 1893 Chicago World's Fair (Columbian Exposition) was built, focusing on its head architect Daniel Burnham.  The book also focuses on the nation's first serial killer, Dr. H. H. Holmes, who used the fair as a tool to lure victims to him.  Throughout the book, you learn a lot of trivia about America, its innovations, and its people.  It is very interesting, and Larson peaks your interest by building up "suspense" with description, making the reader guess as to what is being described.  Now that sounds confusing, but it actually makes sense.  For instance, the author constantly mentions a young engineer trying to come up with an invention of some sort to top Eiffel's Tower from Paris' Exposition.  Later you find that he wants to create a wheel ride until you find out that his name is Ferris and the author is describing the Ferris Wheel.    There is also a lot of, how can one put it, horror?  Like when you watch a horror movie, and you know it's going to bother you how sick the killer is.  It was like that.  What tops off how twisted America's first serial killer was, is that everything really happened and that it all happened right here in America.  It's one thing to hear in the news about a serial killer, it's another to get inside their mind and find out exactly what they've done.  These parts, I must say, are a little more enjoyable than the fair parts, only because it is new and interesting to find out about such a man, as Dr. H. H. Holmes, scary as he was.  The only downside to this book, in my opinion, is that sometimes the information about the fair can be a little boring.  I would much rather have heard about the people rather than what plants and flowers were to be planted at the fair.  These kinds of descriptions can last a few pages, but the rest of the book makes up for it, in my opinion.

       urlLink     Wuthering Heights   by Emily Bronte     Genre:  Classic, Tragedy   Rating (worst 1; best 5):  5   Review:   This is one of those bittersweet novels that you have to love even if it makes you cry.  The Bronte sisters are known for their tragic tales as well as their tragic lives, and this book is one of those sad stories.  I must set out a warning that the ending is of little comfort, at least for me.  Again, I must say that the older language is not an obstacle in reading this book.  For those of you who did not like  urlLink Charlotte Bronte's  Jane Eyre  , this is different in style and story.  One would call it Gothic because of its motifs of ghosts and other supernatural aspects, mystery, and spooky settings.  The story is about the characters Catherine, a beautiful rich young woman, and Heathcliff, a gypsy taken in by Catherine's father.  The two fall deeply in love, but Heathcliff's brutish behavior is an obstacle.  Heathcliff runs away, and in the meantime becomes, at least on the outside, a gentleman.  Catherine has married another man during this time so when Heathcliff returns, problems occur, as one would expect.  One finds him/herself pulling for Heathcliff because of the intensity of his love for Catherine.  Their perception of their love for each other left quite an impression on me.  Rather than the usual two becoming one idea, Bronte has her characters believe that they are the same person.  It is hard to describe, one would have to read the book to understand.  More tragedies pursue, and one feels the constant pain that Heathcliff feels.  Despite all of this, I think this is a wonderful book.  I would not recommend any movie versions since they do not capture what this book is really about, nor stick to the story.

       urlLink     Pride & Prejudice   by Jane Austen     Genre:  Classic, Romantic Comedy   Rating (worst 1; best 5):  5   Review:   I absolutely love this book.  The writing is full of wit and dry humor, chacteristic of Jane Austen's style.  The language is in the style of that age (late 1700s, early 1800s), of course, but it is not hard to read.  I say this because many are scared away by books that use an older style of language.    The story centers around our heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, and mainly around her interactions with her family and a man named Mr. Darcy.  The narrator tells the story from the views of Miss Bennet so the reader is as mistaken by first impressions as she is.  As one reads through the book, the reader comes to new revelations about Mr. Darcy's character, whether mistaken or true.  Full of charm, Austen also pokes fun at the different types of people of that era -- the proud, rich elite, the wreckless soldiers, the simple "country folk" -- but one finds them all both endearing and amusing, despite their flaws.    This was Jane Austen's first written book, although it was not published until the early 1800s.  I would say this is my favorite of her many (Sense & Sensibility, Emma, Persuasion, et al).  For those looking to get more of a feel of the story through a movie, I would recommend the  urlLink BBC/A&E version  because it seems to be the one that captures the spirit of the book best.  It also is, in my opinion, closest to the book.  It is, however, about 3-4 hours since it was first aired as a mini-series.
