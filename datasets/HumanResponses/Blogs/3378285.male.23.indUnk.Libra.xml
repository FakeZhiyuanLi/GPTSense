      hi jaan  these days you dont read mails very regularly ...also dont spend too much time reading them, but still i thought i should mail you. because this way i can speak everything at one go.  we have come a long way from the first innocent meeting to .... seriously if you ask me to change one or more things from that day that would make me happier today, i will not be able to change anything. It seems all perfect.   I might not be able to express this to you in person, but I feel really elated happy by simply beingin your company. Times when you say "hiiiii" on the phone, well it is true music. And when you end up shedding a few tears on me, I feel like taking you to a different world altogether. Well all this is not to impress you, it is just that i dont know when i would get this opportunity again. I also have this gut feeling that one day fate would give me an opportunity to prove my love to you ... it is just that I dont believe in going out to prove something ... but well I am sure I will get a chance.  Well after having said that let me come to my agenda.jaan you have given me tremendous sense of joy over the past few years. No one could have ever loved me as much as you did. I know you say I have not seen the real love, but well even this much is just too much for me.  I dont deserve too much, atleast not as much as i ask for. I might fight with you over this time and again, but I think it is natural to be selfish and i was being over ambitious. With my looks, my personality, my attitutde i probably didnt deserve to become your boyfriend. Add to it your busy life style and the huge physical distance separating us ... well it was never going to be an easy story.  I tried every trick in and outside the text book. Got possesive, became lenient. Interevened in your personal matters, stayed out of your life. Showed caring attitude, displayed "bindaas" attitude. Tried to become a friend, tried having fun remeniscing of my college days. But somehow i could not reach the position I dreamt of.   Now you need to sit and think. The holidays at home would offer great opportunity. I am certain of your close attachment to me. Your undying love as well. But do you still think i am your guy you want to spend your life with. Well you need to sit and think. Away from any influence, any. Because tomorrow you are going to suffer or enjoy the consequences yourself.  See, there is no gain without suffereings and hardships. We learnt it in school and it is really true, i can tell you from experience. even you should not try to take easy decisions which promise running away from crisis because tomorrow this problem is sure to blow out of proportion , beyond control or cure.  Remember i was more of your guide than a boyfriend. and this is an advise from that old chap, who did not claim to love you or desired for you. this is that lost soul who just felt nice knowing you, knowing you were doing well for yourself. i have been discovering myself all along and am quite shocked at times realizing i am not half as "good" as i thought. But this is my time to prove that i really selflessly love you.  So either you say "oh it was a mistake. we were so different, we could never go along well". and have the guts to tell me this calmly. i promise that i will not bother you again with "jaan, please come back". sure i would andar sey love you and continue to be friends, but i will never question your decision. to make things easier for you, i will ensure you dont get an oportunity to feel sorry for me.   BUT ... i know you will NOT do this. i have given you several opportunities. you have never gone away. even this mail you would say "oh ankit must have been pained over something, that is why he is mentally torturing me". well, surprise ...its different.  I WANT YOU TO STAY WITH ME. YOU ARE MY GIRL FRIEND. IT HURTS ME WHEN WE START DISCUSSING OTHER GUYS IN YOUR LIFE. I PRAY FOR THAT DAY WHEN YOU WOULD TELL ME YOU ARE READY TO LEAVE ANY GUY FOR ME.AM I LOUD AND CLEAR ?   This is the real me. He is possesive, just that he is smart not to be over possessive which would be the surest way to lose you. He is ready to fight any guy... immaterial if he gets bashed up in the end. Just that he also respects other's sentiments and knows the issue will be resolved peacefully, not afer some show of strength.   Now listen, WE NEED TO MAKE THIS RELATIONSHIP WORK. OK?? Repeat ... 5 times ....  WE need to make this relationship WORK.   Falling in love is easy, sustaining it requires effort. Now you need to put in the effort.You need to think what you could give to the relationship. I can promise you will get a thousand times more back from it.  As we have seen around us, very few people actually are able to take their love further in their lives. Most people accept defeat to "halaat". You have to choose whether you are ready to fight, or you want the easier way out.   We are going to face hurdles. you would have distractions, i will have (hopefully!!) some distractions myself. well ... after all the education and upbringing what could be a better test of character. There will be gaps, if not Blore Delhi gap, some other gap ... but if all the " i love you" s we have exchanged could not bridge that gap, then well bloody how pointless they were anyway.  Sometimes a late decision is in itself the wrong decision. And I am afraid you are doing just that. I am not asking you to stop talking / meeting anyone ... I know you wont. But atleast let me have the confidence that if I ever ask you to do so, you would willingly accept. I promise that the day i have the confidence I would never ask you to do anything like this.   We have shed enough tears wondering why arent things going good between us! Well I think WE need to do something. As they say, you take a step, I will walk a mile. If you think you have tried enough ( which I can tell you is wrong hehe) well then let me know ... i might have to call it quits but otherwise seriously there is no point we brood and lose good time.  Well for starters, I can try to make you smile atleast once each day. Yes ... SMILE ...as in proper feel happy waala smile. EACH DAY. Well ..and for starters you could promise to give me that opportunity each day. Just the opportunity ... ok ???  I understand you are very busy during normal college days. But think again, is finding ten minutes that difficult. Or you are avoiding talking to me? Avoiding embarrassing questions for which you would have to lie to me. "kiske saath hou?", "kahaan ghoom rahi hou raat ko?" See these questions are just fillers, it is the way you respond to them which makes it problematic for me who is sitting far far away. If you speak the truth confidently, yaar nidhi, believe me jitna bharosa mujhey tumpar hai utna apni harkaton par nahi ...seriously.  I know such a long mail must have killed any enthu you had, but i have more or less conveyed what i wanted to. Read the mail atkeast twice ... depending on your mood you would interpret it differently, and probably understand it better.  We can always part ways and tell people we meet that "it was not worth it !". But i would rather continue to find the real joy than to think of the wasted opportunity of what could have been !   bye. i love you.

      I am talking about bidding farewell. Just experienced that emotion today.Hate it. Now I have four more days and wonder if I will be able to control myself from making a complete fool of myself. Perhaps becoming a fool would be a lot better.  I had not planned it as the last day I would be meeting her. I wanted her to relax in my company, enjoy the simple moments of life with me, feel a little free from worries with me on her side. None of that happened. She regretted having called me, kept insisting we not meet after her next exam. I had completely failed in my efforts to be her true friend.  I dont doubt she loves me.But I am not being the "provider" for her emotional needs. It is next to impossible to fill in in this other guy's shoes. Is there anything I can do to make the relationship going again, or is it just a sinking ship ?  I have never ever tried so hard for achieving anyting. But in this case it is like no alternative way out. I hate it each time she goes, " Uff phir aa gaye". I sulk each time she says, " Arrey, kitni der rahoge yahaan". I wonder if any sensible man would advise me continue with this journey which seems to be heading nowhere.  But the one "i love you" does the trick. It is recharging, refreshing, rejuvenating to say the least. It inspires me to go on and not think about any humiliation, any disappointment, any loss. For one day, it would be this girl who will fill my life with joy. For that one day I have committed my entire adult life. For that day I would be willing to sacrifice the remainder of my life as well.  I thought so deep on this issue. Decided that i would not give her tears. Become a person whom she would long for, for the joy, the smile I would get her. I could only tweak my personality, not become someone else. My efforts for three months now look too meagre. This was possibly the last chance fate could offer me. Feels low too have gone wrong after so much of hard work- mental and physical.  It is time for me to analyze and reassess the situation. I shall not let my promises become mere words. I shall not let my dreams become hollow imagination. I shall follow the path of endless struggle to self destruction if it comes to that.

      My professor once remarked- one should learn to attach, and learn to detach. This would be real character in a man, and his attitude towards love.  At that time I had a simple philosophy - if you really love something, you would never think of letting it go. Well this had a fundamental misguiding assumption - the "thing" has no emotions.  I now have this big task ahead of me. Learning to value other people's emotions. Learning to decide what is good for others. Learning to become unselfish in love. It is going to be very difficult.  It appears impossible how i would be ever be able to walk upto the person I have always wanted and ask her to leave. Would I be able to convince her that she was made for someone else? Sounds sick, but guess life can be cruel at times.  I have not delivered to expectations. I have not provided her with the rock steady emotional support she yearns for. I have not been the macho hunk she is looking for. I have not been the nice funny guy next door- neither nice and funny, nor next door. And now i have saddened her by making her feel guilty for not loving me as much as she should, or rather could have.  But as I keep telling people. Analyzing problems is no good. "Think of solutions". I would have to come up with a plan. It is MY responsibility to make her love me. It is MY job to make her miss me. It is on ME to make her realize I love her more than anyone else.  Hope this blog serves its purpose. Of becoming a reminder each time I get off track, each time I hit a road block, each time I fall into a pit, each time I think this is the last time.

      So another experiment starts today. I shall actually go public with my thoughts, emotions, feelings ??? Cant imagine doing that ... I am just too smart to expose myself.  Shall hope to start some intellectual process with this blog stuff. Long time since I actually sat down and gave something serious a serious thought.  Right now I am interested in Communism, democracy ... blah blah. Hope to actually have an opinion on economics some day. Good thought for a day which might see Manmohan Singh become the Prime Minister.   And to those people who have wandered into my zone, would love to hear your stories of your first blog. Though i am afraid of making friends through blogs. The world is so small that there is good chance of ...
