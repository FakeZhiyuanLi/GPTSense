      Really quick update here,  Yesterday I didn't do much at all. Just basically talked to some friends about the usual stuff. Had a pretty good sleep last night. I managed to get at least eight hours I think, which is pretty good for me.  Today I went swimming in the neighbor's pool, so that was refreshing. Considering that it feels like it's about 32 Degrees out right now.  As for right at the moment, I'm kind of just relaxing in my room. I might decide to watch a movie. I'm not sure though, sounds a little boring.  I'm hoping to get back into Sports again.....correctiom...I NEED to get back into Sports again, 'cause I'm pretty out of shape at the moment, and I need to do something competitively, just for the thrill. I love it.  I'm done for now, nothing more to tell. I'll be back in a couple of days with another update.

      So I'm back for an update. This weekend was actually pretty good. Some company was over on Saturday, so I didn't just sit around mindlessly all day. I ate one of the biggest hamburgers I've ever seen in my entire life for dinner. This thing was massive, when it was sitting on the Barbecue I even asked if it was a Steak! I managed to almost eat the whole thing though, I was pretty hungry.  Today was ok as well I guess. I went out with my dad and sister. She and my dad insisted on seeing Spider-man, so we did. Then I bought a really cool Dream Theater album, it's one of their best, and it was only 10 bucks!  One last thing before I end this. I'm more than likely seeing Fear Factory on August 3rd! That's gonna be one hell of a sweet show! I'm looking forward to it too, because a friend of mine has already been to the Opera House and says that it has a great sound system. Nice!

      I've tried many blogging tools throughout my life, and I can never find one that I truly like. I like simpleness. I like things to be uncluttered, so I believe, just by only registering, that this is the right place for me.  In this blog I may ramble, I may argue, or I may not say anything at all. It depends on my mood at time of post. I will not disclose any extremely personal information on this site purely for safety/security reasons.  Now, onto the real reason why I'm here.  Today didn't start off well at all. My sister little friend decided to call the house at 8:30 this morning, while, in the process, waking me up. :( I need sleep! Of course, it didn't help at all that I was up untill around 4:30 last night. Anyways, the point is, I'm not in a particularly good mood at the moment. Hopefully I'll get better soon.  Anyways, there's not much more I can write about at the present time. So this concludes my first entry.  Later
