      Yup you bastards, I am a bandgeek...and proud of it! I play bass 5 in the percussion section of the Franklin County High School Rebel Pride Marching Band....and...no matter what movies say or what you might hear from other ppl...band camp...SUX...it's fucking hard and kinda boring, EXTREMELY irritating....and the sunburns....oh shit the sunburns...I already got the fucking sunburns and I was wearing my Thundercats wristband...so I have a white streak on my wrist lol. Well, my friend Jared (one of the best snare players and marchers I know) was PISSED @ his snare line. They blow monkey cock, but my bassline is totally kool, *thumbs up* they are a lil lazy and not very formal, but when it came time to deliver, they fuckin delivered. Hell yeah, I love my bassline lol. Well, Ashley's tounge thing was from the cat fish so she gets to use that tounge piercing....oooohhhhhh....vibrating bar bell *loses concentration*....*drools*....*stares*.........................................ANYWAYS, well I think that's it you fuckers, ttyl  Nick  P.S.- zero today, I'm too damn tired to jack off...or am I??!?!! lol adding one! =4

      Today was SOOO much better than the past week. I mowed the grass and went to the chiropractor...that was it...so...boring...but I DID have this fucked up dream. I was gettin pulled over by the police for ...something..I forgot...well, anyways, if I could win this game agains the cop, it would prove that I wasn't guilty. I hadta watch ghosts race in the air and pick the last one, some wierd-ass shit (yes, I'm fucked up in the head, I know this) then Ashley called me and told me that we couldn't be together anymore and I just lost it and broke down crying. Then i woke up. Wierd thing was that when I woke up, I was crying....FREAKYFREAKYFREAKYFREAKY! lol, neways I told Ash about it and she freaked cause she kinda had a similar dream a few days ago. Do you think something is telling us that we shouldn't be together?...WHO GIVES A FLYING FUCK! dreams are dreams and I love Ash and Ash loves me, FUCK dreams. Well that's it I think, oh yeah, some bitch almost killed me in her damn car. Pulled right fucking in front of me. I slammed on the breaks and beat that damn horn.&nbsp;Stupid bitch. Well, I'm out ppls.  P.S.-I'm gonna start a masturbation count so today was 3. CYA LATER! Nick

       What's up crazy motherfuckers, this is my first post, so it'll probably suck. Neways, today was ok. Better than last week..that was probably one of the worst weeks I've ever had. I just kept on steppin' into shitpile after shitpile after shitpile. So today, not a damn thing happened, so it was a good day. Ashley, my girlfriend, her tounge started swelling up and it wasn't good. We don't know if she was allergic to some food or if her tounge piercing is infected, but it's bad. I wish i could fucking do something, but she's out in California and I'm fucking stuck in Tennessee. We met when Sissy (Destiny, our really good friend) introduced us and we just fell in love. We are both horny as motherfuckers so we can't wait till she comes to visit out here...we're gonna fuck like rabbits...kinky rabbits...with handcuffs...and strawberries.... can't wait....*stares off*...*drools*...oh...sorry *wipes off drool* anyways, well I think that's it for now. tty fuckers later!
