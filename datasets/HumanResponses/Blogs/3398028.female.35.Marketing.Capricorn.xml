       urlLink    If I look miserable, It's because I am! No Kipper to wrap his big arms round my waist as I close my eyes throw my arms out and imagine I'm flying... * you spewing chunks yet? * lol  There are having a  'Pirate'  theme this weekend..I have NO idea why and if anyone does feel free to post your answers :P I just know there are lots of ships and anchors. This Ship was like a little house, there was an inside area with benches in and little rope ladders all climbable from one deck to another. I had to hover up to the *hmmm? Technical term  urlLink HIGH BIT!  lol. This is the only one I've seen so far. Not been in There much, Kippers having RL problems and  when he's kicked, I limp  S So I just didn't fancy hanging about not being able to share my virtual life with anyone but my ownsome. He'll be back shortly tho and I'll get some mug shots for ya all!

       urlLink    Found this huge tube on Fantasy Island, When you reach the end you free fall off the end of a cliff allowing you to do tricks all the way down. The ONLY thing that kinda spoils it is a sign the builder placed right at the exit which sorta knocks you sideways and there for doesnt allow you a full thrust exit. urlLink  Another Pic

       urlLink    Me in the Tyr Bone Yard. There recently released 250 houses in Tyr which doubles the games TOTAL number of houses. Owning a house in There is expensive and when I tell people who 'don't' play There that players are paying $200 REAL CASH to own a virtual house they then have to pay a further $10 - $17 a month for rental to There They are totally amazed. As am I to be honest.  There is a great game and highly addictive but on a recent survey I did on a 'choose 5 ' sign. The average player is paying $50 a MONTH to play There if you include the Tbux sales. That MUST make There 'THE' most expensive online game on the world...Correct me if I'm wrong?

       urlLink    Zeda n me shooting the breeze...shes always getting 'booted' and I end up talking to her ghost. Zeda came to There from TSO after I set her the 14 day trial link. We used to run 'simolean' making bots in TSO Shes currently designing for There and is doing mainly furniture..actualy that sofa and rug is some of her current designs. I admire her determination as I gave up on designing after we both got photoshop 7 I just thought ' nah!' tooo hard but she stuck at it and has made huge progress.  Just lil

       urlLink    lol THIS was a practical joke I played on  urlLink Kipper  whilst he was off line I sneaked into his account and treat his avie to a SPA treatment...hee hee added a few pounds and a nice sunbed tan...Looks like a FAT PINT OF GUINNESS rofl! I Yahoo IM'd him saying he 'had' to log into There NOW! I'd logged out of 'his' avie right in the middle of a busy SPA and waited for him to log in unaware...I watched as he looked around him and the first thing he said? " How did I get here? " ????? THEN... " OMFG I'm FAT! " * 2 mins later* " OMFG I'm BLACK & FAT!!...You Fucking sick bitch! " Laugh??? Well..I thought it was funny..I promptly joined him by adding 200 virtual pounds to my avie and we bounced about the beautiful people laughing all the way as Kipper past comment on how my avies ass was hanging down the back of my legs! ( Sorry no pics of me...My ego won't allow it)Oh Go on then  urlLink one   or  urlLink two  pics of me looking freaky!

       urlLink    Welcome to my There blog site. I've seen these nifty journal type sites and wanted one for a while but I found one freeeeee *laughs at all those fools paying Tbux for theirs* Over the next for days * ahem * weeks then ok?! I'll be adding loads of  urlLink There pics  and journals about the game and my adventures when in There. It's an awsome game and * is this sad?* It's totaly changed my life! I NEVER watch TV anymore...thats godda be good right? And I'm also involved with web designing,  urlLink photoshop designing  and write for an online newspaper called The Motu Eagle. Me and  urlLink Kipper  met in TSO 8 months ago. I was so bored there after 1 year and we came to There and never looked back. We have just opened an in world business called  There Pawn Brokers too...There provides so many different avenues to explore regards to software & internet hobbies...If it wasn't for finding There in March 2004 I wouldnt even know what a 'blog site' was.

       urlLink    So this is IanEsor a very good friend *ahem* of mine & Kippers....I KNOW you don't believe Kipper exists , that he's a figment of my sad & lonely imagination...BUT I swear I'll get a shot of us together YET! Anyway...Ian & Kipper were driving through the desert..Very open and deserted and drove into a crevice..The ground changed from sand to a dark brown and then a mist appeared and it grew darker the further they ventured into this narrowing trough. Eventual they drove upto the back of a clubhouse and other small hut like buildings were dotted about. Dead trees poked up from the ground and bright red molten lava flickered on the ground. The huts had skulls and  urlLink very gothical decor  No one else was there but there was a billboard with PrOngs advertisement asking for souls for 500T$ * eeeekkkkkk* Was an interesting place and one I had never seen or heard of before. They got back in the buggy and soon drove out into a brighter greener landscape again and with some relief I think. Thanks to  Cotton Candy  for providing the name to this place lol...as detailed in her comments..hee hee.. My only saving grace is my description must of been  good enough  that she knew where I was on about haahaa

       urlLink     Following recent personal events, I logged back into There today and arrived at the same place I left yesterday when i left swearing I'd never go back. My friend Kipper & I have sorted our differences out and after some miserable days, decided life whether it be real or virtual isn't  'as great'  as it is when we have each other. This time when I landed in the Ocean were the Ship was * as detailed below* I could look round with a smile on my face and set off with a determined sense of adventure. Next to the ship that I found yesterday was a  urlLink pyramid PAZ  and I climbed it and balanced on one foot smiling Inside...Was a 2 level  urlLink living quarter  No stairs from one level to the other' you just  some how  beamed up onto your choice of seating. It was a little out of place stuck in the middle of the ocean but it would look awesome in Egypt which as yet hasn't really been expanded. Its a shame PAZ's aren't more private as in, you can lock the door and have some decision in who you want walking in and who you don't Apparently There has released some 'porta homes' Half PAZ half houses and there is more power regards to privacy and your right to refuse unwanted visitors.  I decided to re open  urlLink There Pawn Brokers  and went to the busiest place in There to drop my urlLink  2 team score boards  and generate some business.  Whilst there joined a group of people chatting. One female avie kinda left me speechless with her constant demands for attention and her 'so obvious' tactics to get people to look at her profile & picture...By saying  "  I was accused of using a false picture  the  other day as he said I didn't look my age at all..which was flattering"   It Must of been a tactic that worked well cuz it had me looking too...And yes she was a lovely looking woman. But her written profile was all me me me me me, me modeling  and 'This is a group photo so I cut my head out of the rest'  *NUFF SAID*  and how she had tried to make her avie as real to herself as possible * her words*   round breasts, big cutes eyes, brown hair...but some how it didn't do her justice... * again HER WORDS * Some one asked me a question about Photoshop and she did an emote were by her avie looked at her watch in boredom as clearly she wasn't happy unless the conversation was about her and her looks It dawned on me no matter  HOW  beautiful a person was on the surface...The ugliness from within shone thru so VERY loud & clear in There and this girl placed far too much emphasis on her outward appearance in hope it would win her friends and attention...I suspect she was very lonely in real life.  I left the group but b4 I did I asked her " Have you ever heard of the Del a soul song 'Me, Myself & I?" and walked away....WOW she was like something you only read about in soap operas!!

       urlLink    Its a sad time for me & Kipper. We both found There together in March and met in TSO 8 months ago. We are no longer ' together' for reasons only me & he know about. I logged into There for a short while and was driving about in my UK buggy, the same one I bought Kipper and found this urlLink  PAZ ship  and took a look about it feeling very much alone. Inside was this room with lots of empty seats and and empty cage * Above* The owner has furnished it fantastically so I thought I'd include some pictures I took in this article. It had its own  urlLink bedroom  and even a  urlLink crapper  lol...I sat in there crying for a short while before I decided I didn't want to be alone in There anymore....Even when Kipper wasn't with me before he was with me in heart and I never felt alone knowing everything I found I could show him later..This was 'our' paradise...and now it just seems like one big empty vacuum and I miss him terribly......

       urlLink There Pawn Brokers | We pay Tbux To Players Every Day!  This is my In World business. As Tbux is a constant requirement in There and there appears to be a shortage..Seemed an obvious thing to do. Now & again a player will see something in auction they want NOW and don't have the Tbux OR the REAL CASH to buy Tbux at that particular time. And so There Pawn Brokers provide instant Tbux for unwanted items they may have in their 'My Things' folder Yeah...They could still sell their stuff in auction BUT  whether  they sell AND  how much they receive  are 2 very important factors to consider. TPB will give instant guaranteed Tbux in the same day!

       urlLink    This is The kinda passtime I & many other Therians enjoy. Buggy Racing. There are various types of tracks all  urlLink custom built  by players who host the events. I actualy came 3rd in this race * RARE EVENT* and was offered Tbux by SirTiger the event host for coming in 3rd. I kindly refused as now that here have canceled hosting 'credits' the winnings are coming out of the hosts pocket. he thanked me for refusing..If you host events in There its now an unspoken understanding how difficult it is to keep hosting great events like this and offering your OWN money as prizes. SirTiger is legendary in Buggy Hosting and the race I joined in above was a 5 lapped race..VERY long and normaly I get nudged and tipped over and come last on the shorter length races..but for some reason this longer styled race seemed to work in my favour! I was so proud lol as most of 'my' buggy driving is spent with my avies head in the ground and wheels spinning up in the air lol

      THE END OF THERE.......OR IS IT?  I was chatting to a friend in There on Sunday afternoon and he said something that at the time I sorta thought 'huh?' but didn't think much more about it...Something about  'was I staying until the doors were closed?'  I assumed he meant there was to be an early maintenance that day, Then Much further on in the convo I asked about his designs and THAT'S when the proverbial 'shit hit the fan' Chustlee went on to say There had announced they were closing in 90 days! We had major lag at the time and connection problems and I lost him  * looking back probably a strain on the servers as ALL the players logged in to try find out what was going on... Was it REALLY true..etc* And so offline I scanned the net for info and found various sources of statements including Theres official forum statement. It's all a bit confusing. 'There' have said they are NOT closing but following recent staff cutbacks they were no longer providing bug fixes or any more developments and were concentrating on their 'platform'   To this day I don't know what the 'platform' means. I have read less official statements saying to buy some There property now whilst players panic and in a month this 'blip' will all be forgotten.... Were the '90 days' comes in I have yet to determine  All of this has left me bewildered, angry and upset...Kipper paid for my annual account 3 months ago and I have invested a LOT of real money into the game as players are encouraged to do. And not being allowed to sell your account..Your investing direct into There Inc at the end of the day as you get no financial return on your investment and no opportunity to sell any of your virtual goods on for real cash...  So us players have ultimately been 'investing' in the game on average aprox $50 a month per player if you include the Tbux sales.   Now yes, this angers me but you what?  I don't CARE about the loss of money ...and I am a LOT better off than those recent newer players who have bought fun zones and houses. One recently selling for 3 million Tbux ( yes that's $15,000 REAL US DOLLARS!) I bet he or she is delighted at this news!  There 'is' a virtual paradise, everything is beautiful including yourself...Even the dogs don't poop. The scenery was amazing especially when in hover crafts the game engine for all vehicles was just about as good as you can get. I have NO faults with the game apart from the ugly  'I'm richer than you are' mentality  that its economical structure created.....Were the designers and the RL wealthy people sat on their virtual thrones looking puzzled when those mere mortals dared to complain about Theres.coms lack of Tbux earning opportunities.  It wasn't perfect..And for the kids who didn't have any money other than spending money..They DID have the 'know how' on how to hack into the system and so out of the desire to keep up with the beautiful people...defrauded and scammed within the game.   Yeah yeah...lol..THAT was the ONLY problem...it generated virtual material snobbery...And I strongly suspect many of the so called ' fat cats' with the fun zones and the house and the latest gear and vehicles were probably in REAL LIFE very ordinary people who didn't have 'much' of a happy life really..for why else invest that much time & RL money into a 'pretend' life unless their real life was pretty shitty?  Yes I know this will raise an eyebrow and I am by no means saying  urlLink I am the exception  to this theory ...I spend a lot of TIME in There due to health issues..I think ANYONE who spends more time  in virtual than actual  must be escaping something...And for this reason 'if' There is to close there are going to be a LOT of genuinely upset people.  we will 'all' have to start over as noobies again now in a new virtual world which I know NOW will not match upto Theres standards.

        urlLink    When Kippers not online and Im in There alone I rarely speak to strangers. * Mummy brought me up well* I am a loner by heart and this is my time to poke about peoples houses & PAZs exploring players tastes without boring Kipper to death. So I set off today on  urlLink my Bacio  Firstly I found a small porta home with pussy cats both inside &  urlLink out  As you know we bought a large porta home but it only allows 10 items to be dropped inside and I'm beginning to wish we had got the smaller ones that allow more furniture drops especially after finding this  urlLink small porta home  named StarScape Studio by the owner because he felt it was  urlLink furnished like a studio  He had left a stereo out with spacey type music on which created an ambiance. Further  urlLink  down the road  I decided to put on my hoverpack after seeing this  urlLink amazing PAZ  I'd seen it before and was glad Id found it again. This  urlLink beauty  takes up 5 Large Porta Zones JUST for the floating part which had separate rooms and  urlLink glass bottomed floors & corridor's  And to add to that the owner had added a  urlLink HUGE glass garage  I added it up and to keep all this lot out 24/7 ( yes I KNOW I drone on about the cost of keeping your PAZ out but really!) this player was paying aprox 8 x 6.5k a WEEK just to keep all this little lot out. So in REAL cash terms....hmmm?  (counts fingers & toes)  52,000 tbux a week.. 208k a month and in CASH aprox $100 JUST to display this baby  24/7 in world....And what a baby it was..Truly beautiful . It puts all those There  REAL Estate owners to shame. Now, whilst I was impressed with the flashiness of the last PAZ this next one REALLY had me hooked. It was  positioned JUST were the light turns to dark and the fog kicks in creating a  urlLink swamp like atmos  Again the owners had left a stereo  urlLink outside the property  this time with oriental type pan pipe music. But what REALLY drew me to this  urlLink TINY place  was how very private it was.  urlLink Dark & almost creepy  but I loved it! It had a  urlLink tiny kitchen  area at one side a  urlLink lounge in the middle  with transparent screens allowing you views into the jungle behind you. And finally a  urlLink bedroom  at the other side. I had acquired a 'tag along' who must of got bored & bewildered with me as he left me there *after his pathetic attempt of sitting in the bed and emoting 'sexy & wink'* and I was 'that' impressed I left a tiki scroll on the roof complimenting the owners taste and begging them to tell me were I could find one. I REALLY want a dark deserted and VERY difficult house to intrude, for me & Kipper to hide away from the rest of the virtual world. And this ' water bunlgalow ' type PAZ was as perfect as I have found. So much so, my 2 story porta home is up for sale now :P

        urlLink    This is a favorite pastime of me & kippers. urlLink Avie Football  Its a  urlLink harmless way  to take out a little tension from real life and the  urlLink views  can be great! I spent part of the day alone on Sunday looking for my purple heather hills and  urlLink YAY!  I found a place to drop the  urlLink porta house   Thing is, for every hour you leave your PAZ out ( place were you can drop all your items ) you pay tbux and if that's 24/7 thats 6.5k tbux a week OR 26k a month. In real money thats aprox £13 and when I played The Sims Online £13 is about what it cost you to play the WHOLE game per month...so call me a skin flint but I aint paying THAT just to play 'part of a game' So I took  urlLink one last look  about and packed it back up again.  I decided its been a while since I flashed the  urlLink Red White & Blue Bike  about and found a great  urlLink bike track  by Ponder but was too hard for me lol...i still can't get the revs right and my mouse is totaly unresponsive to the  urlLink tight bends  So I found a different place to wave the  urlLink UK flag  and Kipper met me and we raced each other ( I won AGAIN ) much to his frustration....  urlLink who loves ya baby!?

      Teacher  urlLink    SO Sunday morning me & Kipper settled into our new home and domestic bliss settled in with us. We sat reading  urlLink  newspapers in bed   Then pottered about me buying and fixing screens up against the 2 doors to stop intruders 'intruding' as Kipper got bored and let the dogs out...And through gritted teeth asked him " sweety? Please can you put the dogs away?" as they yapped about my feet and ran in and out of the screens I was loosing patience with. Once the DIY had been done we packed our porta home away and set off on the  urlLink  Bacio Bikes   again. And ended up at the Dune Buggy races. Me and Kipper ended up in an head to head race as I ranted about how I would NEVER race with him again convinced he purposely nudged me over leaving me 'tits up' and head in the sand as he skidded off leaving a trail of sand behind him.. He won one race...I won the last  * just * and then he announced  urlLink   'F1 Racing'    was on TV and he was tired... So it's official.... The  urlLink  Honeymoon period   is over.

       urlLink    So..its weekend and after release of the  urlLink  Bacio Bikes   There also released the Porta Homes.  *above* Me & kipper spent some quality time  urlLink  talking  and decided to venture off to find pastures green on our  urlLink  hoverboat  finaly landing in a location both green and with amazing   views   from the  urlLink   balcany   Porta Homes arent  'as good'  as the real Houses in There. you cant simply lock the door to do some of  urlLink  this in private   but you CAN maybe put a screen over the doors...or in our case..maybe hammer some planks of wood over the windows and doors to stop unwanted and usualy bored people walking in and talking about themselves over your coffee table for an hour! lol We have had many variations of PAZs from the floating decks in Tyr to SkyScrapers but the Porta Homes 'DO' almost look real infact where we positioned ours..to the untrained eye, we blended right in with the 'real' There houses...so much so when we logged in later, 2 other porta homes had become our neighbours.  I wonder what the $500 real estate owners of There houses feel about us  trailer park trash  landing our porta zones on their doorsteps... Kipper began to build a camp fire and stack a pile of burning tyres...whilst I browsed the auctions for pitbull terriers and an old Ford Cortina we could place on bricks and leave in the garden  More pics to follow of inside our new home.

        urlLink    Hi , I've got a few PAZs I want to share with you as it seems to be a fav pastime of mine. You know when you walk passed a RL house/window and you JUST can't help taking a peep inside? ( or is that just me? ) well...In There you can just walk into almost ANY virtual home and snoop about admiring or insulting the owners taste.  So I'm thinking of dedicating the whole site to just that.  'There Home's & Gardens' ..What do you think? Is it just 'MY' fetish or would you be interested too? Anyway..Cast your beady eyes on this little lot before you decide. The first home is another newly released porta home owned by   'djflip'   urlLink   The Outside was kinda normal    But  urlLink  inside   was impressive. Obviously MALE  urlLink   But I loved it !  Later on I found  urlLink   Mercedes    building her PAZ extention to her REAL There house. I snooped about inside and took shots. The great thing I liked about it was how add on PAZ build items can separate a house..Give it 2 levels or a backroom  urlLink   Image 1     urlLink   image 2    There is little difference to a medium porta home to a real There house apart from the privacy and the fact that when you enter the porta zone which the porta home is dropped in, you get a pop up welcoming you to a Large Porta Zone. ( too many  'porta'  words in that paragraph?) I saw some  TEST PORTA ZONES'  in There Central the other day. It advised they were semi private ( didn't say how so ) but that they hadn't been tested and could be buggy..The auction had reached 30k at that point and an ordinary Porta Zone sells for aprox 2k. I nearly bought one but I'll wait to hear the lowdown first...30K is a lot on an item that may well turn out to be crapola. I was invited to attend  Cotton_Candy's   urlLink   house warming event   CC OWNS a REAL HOUSE!!  urlLink   (posh)    she's a peach though and one of those people who just bring the best out in other's. The last PAZ I wanted to share with you is owned by  StormKitty  and she had great taste and a sense of humor based on her  urlLink   welcome scroll    The  urlLink   external building    was a revamp of the original skyscrapers and was made to look more like bamboo than steel. It Had the same  urlLink   drop options ins ide   and she had made it look really co-ordinated and beautiful.   urlLink   Outside     StormKitty  had added a  urlLink   TreeHouse    complete with an old dinosaur  urlLink   who I took a bit of a shine to

        urlLink    I was feeling kinda chatty and as I like the sound of my own voice who better to talk to that a couple of 'crash test dummies' I found these two looking about on the floor for their pants..seems they had been playing behind the back of the coliseum :) Well..It's been a while since I posted here and i have SHIT LOADS of pictures urlLink (mainly Bacio Bike shots)  which I'm SURE you must be sick to death of by now? Regardless... urlLink heres another  Id heard about the space station from other sites and players but was kinda urlLink disapointed  in all honesty..what?? Oh I know! Another Bacio pic :P hahaha It was OK but by the time Id found it Id already seen smaller versions of it in Tyr other players had built so it lost its novelty factor. So I kissed urlLink Kipper  Goodnight and called it a day. Since the release of the Bacio we have found so much more of There...will spend hours just driving about urlLink exploring  Were as before we only teleported to places & events. I will be adding a MUCH more detailed post soon including some new finds and our  Oro Lounge Break In  ( yes I KNOW we aren't the first LOL) But for now...Kipper is picking me up in RL to goto his new flat and sort his life out....tusk! Men! :)

        urlLink    Its been a very stressful time for Kipper and consequently me this last month. He's now a single man living a single life which isn't all that great to start with , but I think he will find he'll be a  urlLink   happy bunny    in time. Whilst he's been away from the Virtual, I've been spending a lot of time alone in There as you all know.  More recently in  urlLink    Tyr    I discovered a new  urlLink   tourist attraction    A  HUGE  tube which when you jumped inside it  urlLink    THIS HAPPENS    at the top. The still pictures don't  really  do it justice, but people were flying out the end at high speeds and landing with their heads up their asses! As I like poking about people's houses and PAZ's in  There  I found some  urlLink    beautiful Tyr houses    Most owners like to keep to the  urlLink   Tyr theme      urlLink   Some don't    And on that subject I'd like to draw you attention to the headliner photo. That was taken whilst me & kipper were touring Tyr together. We wandered into some houses and found  urlLink   THAT    lol (I hope she doesn't read her chat logs!) We also found this amazing Tyr house which so far  HAS  to be the nicest one I've seen. Unfortunately the owners were both AFK so we couldn't get to find out what  urlLink   THIS    was all about. Me & kipper cant afford a house in There. Kipper always was the one to look after me financially in-game and he has extra RL financial commitments now.  Anyway, I found a hidden place in There. Dropped 2 casual porta zones and 10 items, I've tried to get 2 screens against the only entrance. It wont stop  REALLY  persistent players getting in as they can see our name tags still and some of our chat bubbles. But its free and its ours and I bought myself a new outfit to greet him in as I showed him about for the first time :)  If only REAL LIFE was like this!  urlLink  Image one     urlLink  Image Two     urlLink  Image Three

        urlLink    And gave it to  urlLink   Kipper    It took me a  WHOLE  lodda mailing & pleading to house owner's who had been auctioning their houses & not getting the reserve price or worst still, no bids at all. I had a lot of angry players pissed at my suggestion & offer's in Tbux implying I was 'mad' And one   intellectual sort  wrote and quoted   'you can't get a tent house for that!..And no I'm NOT interested in your offer! '   Well, here's the   proof   that you 'can'  urlLink    And Its beautiful     It was in auction for 300K. No one had bid and the auction was about to end in 2 days. I contacted  Chiclet  the owner, and politely sympathised with her & other house owners who seemed to be loosing Tbux on house sales now compared to what they paid originally. And added, that If it  didn't  sell in auction I had 175K and would buy it off her.  She mailed me back! And as none of us was sure when the 18K rent was due and 175K was all I had, the sweety let me have it for 150K and ended the auction early.  So you see,  Mr  'You can't even buy a Tent House for THAT!! '  If you appeal to people's intellect and  common sense   they will agree with what most house owners are coming to terms with and that's, since the total amount of  There   Property is doubling (Tyr) the worth of ALL  There  houses has dropped and will continue to do so as more & more are released into auction by  There.   Anyway, I can't for the life of me remember the location but it has a  urlLink   Watch   Tower   right outside our front door and huge grey rocks and little permanent  There  huts & benches for players to sit and admire the views. Its located very high up on the hills and looks like a tiny  urlLink   tourist village     Kipper was over the moon and we dropped our....Pants...ahem..Sorry, I meant'  urlLink   Doggie's    sat down and felt like a young couple in their first new house discussing what type of furniture we needed...and who had to clean the dog crap up from the garden  We also had another person to tell they now had a  There  house.  Zeda , Zeda was a player we met in  The Sims Online  and we all lived together and ran Pizza Places and money making houses.  When me & Kipper left TSO I wrote to Zeda and much to my surprise she followed us. Like us she's done all the PAZ thing and porta home thing but was delighted to be finally room mates again like we used to be.  So Kipper left for the evening leaving me to have a  urlLink   nosy round the hood    and before I logged off for the evening...took a final look at the  urlLink   Sugar Coated sign    we had written to announce our claim to a piece of virtual  There  space!

        urlLink    OK.. I  KNOW  I over-do the ' urlLink    Pussy     jokes but I cant help myself!lol Me, Kipper & Zeda ( who is a friend from TSO ) have been looking at the  real estate  aucions and I've been bidding like crazy!.  I feel kinda hypocritical as upto now, I've always snubbed the ' REAL  estate ' owners in  There .. but it seems I'm JUST as influenced by virtual prestige and snobbery as the best of them. I godda say it's a whole new learning curve for me and I've met some  urlLink   REAL PRICKS    in my quest to find a virtual roof for the three of us. Some players actually believe not only should they get back the amount they paid for their  There  house  BUT  also the rent they paid too ???  HELLO??  Is it me, or do they have their heads stuck in the  urlLink   Wishing Gates?    Based on my research, the cheapest  There  house's are the Tyr cliff edge caves as they are tiny with no windows and certainly no room for more than a card table and a group seating set.And  rent is 25k a month so people (Inc me) think 25k is a lot to pay for a windowless tiny cave like dwelling. Anyway..The going rate for those is aprox 100K...and falling   After that, there's the  Tent Houses . Now I didn't realise there was so much difference in worth from one  There  house to another. But apparently a  Tent House  is not  'as'  desired as the rest due to it having no windows and being kinda small too inside. Although they ARE bigger than the above type property.  Anyway I bid on one in auction and after reaching the 'high bidder' status wrote to the owner offering them 100K if their reserve wasn't met in auction. To my delight I received a reply saying '  yes as they hadn't had any offers'   BUT THEN  I asked a beta player whether 100K was a good price and was told a  Tent House  wasn't worth 50k! So In my ignorance & stupidity I retracted my bids & wrote to say 'sorry' Only to then realise I had been misinformed and actualy 100K  was  a good price and so I bid again and wrote (feeling like a noob) They were happy to do the deal still, but as yet, me and the seller haven't been online at the same time despite my mails. I have a feeling they have changed their mind and are waiting to see what the auction brings as the last two attempts they tried to sell the Tent Houe..the bids reached 200K but not the reserve price. I Can't say I blame them.  I've also been offered a medium sized Tyr house for 175K but the LAG in that place is terrible with all the  urlLink   PAZ's    that players are dropping in Tyr these days.  PLUS that's all we have , 175K and I think once we own a house it will rarely be used and I will grow to resent paying rent every month.   There's a lot to be said for PAZ's you can drop them were ever you feel like it..Why be stuck in the same place all the time?   There's  real estate is kinda 'up in the air' at the moment..Owners are still reluctant to sell at the new lower prices that buyers are prepared to pay since the amount of real estate doubled following the release of Tyr houses.  Anyway at the end of a hard days bidding Kipper and I relieve the stress by playing  urlLink   Crash Test Dummy    Football. Or by  urlLink   shooting the shit out of each other    And he's such a romantic at heart...always knows what  urlLink   soft kind words    to whisper to calm my frazzled nerves.  So despite my best efforts and various tactics to find a house that doesn't cost more than my  REAL  rent costs...We're still homeless...And that's OK cuz from what I've seen of the current house owners..many are pissed at loosing money OR fed up with not being able to build or move about and  HAVE  to pay rent each month ... Its a little too much like RL to me..I don't need the commitment of  HAVING  to find tbux for the months rent or I may loose a lump of real cash I had invested into my  virtual house ??? Its madness if you think about it from a RL perspective!

        urlLink    Well, we moved in and decorated..Wow THATs a big job! Takes hours plugging thru all the hundreds of auction items and walls..Took me 1 hour JUST to find the right fire! Its been a while since we  urlLink  played cards   So decided to run our very first ' HOUSE ' event and make it a Card Game. Kipper had  Floyd  playing in the background and a guest who we'd never met b4 even gave me a little blue bird which perched on  urlLink   my card table    as a house warming gift.  The event went off great actually.. I got the nerves about ppl not turning up or staying but it was ok and Kipper took    back seat   letting me  urlLink   play hostess    Zeda decided to buy her own house...Well actually we had to kick her out after a knife fight me & her had. It all started when I noticed she was buying the same designer clothes as me and even the same hair styles & colors. At first I was flattered, but then one of my dogs when missing...Kipper found him dead apparently he'd fallen off the balcony surrounding our house. Then much to mine & Kippers horror he logged into the game and spent the night with me alone... urlLink   talking deep and personal stuff   and intimate talk about how he likes his  urlLink   organ played with   Stuff only me & he talked about.. He suspected something was wasn't right when  urlLink   THIS    happened as normally only I am able to stay awake after an hour of his company...We found out later Zeda had sneaked into my account and was passing herself off as ME..Not only wearing my clothes and make-up..Not content with rooting thru the dirty laundry basket for my underwear...but she wanted my MAN too!!  (not really...She is a designer and wanted to display her designs so bought her own house down at the cannery)

        urlLink    It's been VERY quiet in There of late, auctions have come to a standstill as there appears to be a lack of Tbux and maybe summer is making people wanna go out more..Either way its dull as dogshit right now. We were discussing how many 'AFK' events appear to be popping up now and how we both feared  There  would end up like The Sims Online were EVERYONE was AFK and no one ran events anymore..I fear this may happen as the hosting credits have stopped ( and there for me & kipper don't host) and yet  There  still charge us to hire a fun zone to run events. We BOTH agreed we would pay 100 Tbux to attend an event like a race or cards or a quest if they were reputable. I just wish we could get this out to the reputable hosters..I think this would solve a LOT of  There's  financial problems and also get good events running again. Anyway me & kipper was exploring the beautiful virtual land saying how sad it would be to let a game like this go to the dogs due to poor management. I said I hadn't seen  The Village  since it was opened and wanted to go see the  urlLink   new style houses again   . The 3 houses at  The Village  are all owned by one player, we suspect a  There  employee. Each one was very similar to the next apart from the clubhouse which had a miniature stage area allowing you to stand and entertain and all that normally comes from standing on a stage. I drooled at the new decor and real life fires and then we took a seat and had a  urlLink   staring competion   . I said I would EASY pay 500K for one of those houses..And we  urlLink   took a look outside   . It 'is' a beautiful place with  urlLink   winding rivers    with  urlLink   bridges   and trees and dirt tracks... I wanted to have a GOOD look about so tried to drop my Bacio..but there was no dropping allowed in the immediate area of the 'Three Housed Village' so we set off running  urlLink   and running some more  ...  urlLink   and further still    Soon it became a  urlLink   Game   ...and soon after that, it became a  urlLink   pain in the ass    We had run half way out into the ocean before we both decided it was all a bit pointless really. What 'is' the point in ? The Village  Apart from to look pretty and hold events in the 3 houses...Which most players prefer to hold events in their OWN house anyway..hence the deserted beautiful place...All a bit   look but don't touch'  So anyway, we played a game of ' lets go thru the pre selected There favorite places ' that you find added to your list of 'Favs' as you level up. I started first & summoned Kipper we ended up at  urlLink   Mystical Temple    seen it before but never mind...Then it was Kippers turn and he found  urlLink   Lost In Transit    a place with supposed crates and parcels that have fallen from Planes and some  urlLink   Windmills    I had a place 'Ariel View ' in my favorites..Basically it teleported you very high up over the Motu Islands and you  urlLink   freefall    for about 5 minutes till you hit the ground and bounce about unharmed. Kipper didn't seem to have this place on his list so I teleported him as soon as I started to fall...Then he saved it and he teleported me...meaning I was falling AFTER him the second time round. As I was looking down to spot Kipper below me..I noticed  urlLink   all his transport   coming up at me at high speed! I saw the two  urlLink   Austin Powers    buggies at first clash into each other, then the hover boards followed so I jumped on one and  urlLink   did board tricks    all the way down feeling very fucking clever when I landed still feet firmly on board :P We tried LOTS of times to get in a buggy as each of us threw and retrieved our buggies for the other falling above us..but none of us could manage to 'get in' any quick enough without a message appearing saying ' Object too far away' I'm thinking It may make good game/event...What do you think?

        urlLink    As I was waiting for Kipper in There recently, I decided to drop some of my There Pawn Broker signs in Tyr. Upon arrival in the once quiet & beautiful  'Dark Side Of The Moon'   I saw in the distance, fairy lights twinkling and made my way over to the  urlLink  'Neon Travelers Caravan Site'   that different players had built together. Each section had its own  urlLink   Caravan   and picnic table & bench. We decided to join a fellow neighbour at his table  urlLink   He didn't seem to mind !  Kipper was having major  LAG  problems in Tyr and recently, it's become an issue there...It used to be almost deserted but recently since the new  There  houses have been built..Its like  urlLink   PAZ CITY    So I ran about taking in the  urlLink   Weird & Wonderful   It looked like a car boot sale on LSD with all kinds of junk, some glowing some not..can's of beer and rubbish bins...half eaten burgers left on the picnic tables...As I walked up the lane of  Virtual Trailer Trash  I saw another neon sign  urlLink   BAR    Remembering it was 4th July and that in the USA this was  independence Day  I found  urlLink   THIS    Was a proper Bar complete with bartender and a hand full of people all using voice and chatting to each other  urlLink    under the moon & stars    ... I was that caught up in my casual 'eves dropping' I forgot all about Kipper and his LAG & connection problems and when I called over to him to meet me at the bar, I saw no name tag and no Kipper..So I wandered thru the  urlLink   amusing & Damb right UGLY stuff    and sat myself down outside another caravan  urlLink  Alone    Picking thru the remains of someones cold left over pizza & listening to the distant glasses tinkling and people talking & laughing celebrating the 4th July in the bar near by.  LAG in Tyr is a MAJOR gripe at the moment..it used to be beautiful and maybe its just me but I think ( with the exception to this featured article) all the ugly neon springs and space stations, and anything that 'glows in the dark' draws the eye from the real beauty of Tyr...Which was the Moon, Stars and the huge dinosaur bones left out as permanent Hover Board ramps...It seems to be a place for players with little style, class or building skills to just drop their crap in a bid to be the 'loudest' and for that we have to be constantly driving into a lot of it or rubber banding about..I'm just  VERY  thankful we didn't buy a There House in Tyr . We nearly did but for the same reasons I'm pointing out here..As soon as we stepped outside we were struck by LAG and faced with bright green columns and crap...Its like having the Clampits move in next door!

       urlLink    Well..What can I say? lol Kipper been using his bedican compass and we found almost untouched land with little  urlLink   Porta Home Villages    I love  urlLink  Cherry Blossom Trees    in RL so loved this little place. The new SPAZs ( Super PAZ ) are great for creating a small community of friends who can all share the PAZ time charge. There was a  urlLink   Night Club    porta home with  urlLink   dance cages mounted to walls    which I found irresistible.  I 'was' alone lol...I HATE those stupid dances always feel about 13 standing in a group pulling 'Fuck Faces' as you do the 'Twist' Anyway Kippers new( and VERY temporary) dial up was getting him down..He's been behaving oddly...Almost as tho he's blind  urlLink   This kinda thing    tends to happen when he's driving at the moment. Anyway as usual I dragged his bored ass around all the wonderful  urlLink   gardens    and he reminded me my 70's  urlLink   BUSH    was long overdue a trim :P We decided to sell our  urlLink   House    OR rather 'I' did. I am /was convinced house prices in  There  are going to continue to drop as more & more Tyr homes are released into auction. Some of he Tyr homes ( the small cave like ones) are selling in auction for 10 - 20K! PLUS as detailed above, the release of the SPAZs and porta homes means you can drop a 2 story house in a 200x200 PAZ and have loads of drops left over for a garden outside too!  I am always finding wonderful  urlLink   PAZ places    and players choices of location are very  urlLink   Unique    I am torn all the time from owning a real  There  house and paying a set amount in rent OR being creative and make my own style of Home which we can put away and drop any place we fancy... But in the end we sold the house to SiXeR and made a little profit too...altho not as much as HE intended to do...Kipper saw it in auction the next day for almost TWICE what he paid us for it...So then I felt I'd made a mistake and been a little hasty...Maybe players who think that once all the Tyr homes are released that the original  There  houses will climb back up in value. Plus Kipper was clearly upset I'd sold our home...He said he saw it as OURS and liked having our names on the sign..I felt crappy as I'd bought it him as a gift. So I found a clubhouse not far from were we lived, same rent but ( and correct me if I'm wrong) with a 'clubhouse' there's more flexibility for decor...IE: in the old house as it was in Kippers name I  had to set an event to be able to decorate of move furniture etc..So it never really felt like 'ours' more 'his' A clubhouse, all we have to do is create a group just with me & kipper as members and then either of us can decorate as & when without having to set up events. So anyway...I replaced out home. Its not 'as' nicely situated as the last one in my opinion altho SiXeR said the watch tower on our door step was a 'bad' feature...But me & kipper LOVED that about it..So I've bought the new house...Got a cheap ( shh!! Its a secret ) but Kipper...don't get too comfy sweety..you KNOW what I'm like!! I'm already seeing how much we can get for it lol finally, last night just after selling the house, I was doing a  There Pawn Brokers  trade and 'meant' to send 23,000 tbux to my customer. Wasn't till 15 minutes later I noticed my balance was 38k instead of 238K!..Yea you guessed it  DIZZY COW   me had added 1 zero too many... I swear the  urlLink   Turtles Head Was touching the cloth    I was writing in CAPS trying to explain to Kipper wot  I'd done....He's telling me to ask for it back...I said "  NO WAY is this guy gonna give me back 200K!"  But  D2junkie  was a man of supreme honor and did send it back instantly! I was in disbelief... I really was! I consider myself VERY lucky and he deserves a mention for being a decent bloke... He got a 7000 bonus for giving it me back :)
