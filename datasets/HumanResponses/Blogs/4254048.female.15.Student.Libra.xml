      Here's a translation of what happened with Shinhwa Shopping in japan (vid uploaded by the lovely BEE    urlLink THE VIDEO  credits: Bee   now here's the translation:  Shinhwa Shopping--- 4th Jib  Hyesung: They shouldn’t be in a bad mood, right? Eh, they don’t seem to recognize us? Odd, I dressed myself well for this too! It’s great here! Hello!! I am Shinhwa! Hmm, seems like no one knew us.  Narrator: They started singing, but people on the street still had no reaction. So they began playing with the Barbie. Hyesung was playing till the end, when all the members left, JunJin came back and wrapped his arm around the model.  JunJin: This is my girlfriend, say a greeting.  Minwoo: Hey! Hurry!!  Narrator: Japanese fans suddenly recognized them. Seeing the fans, JunJin and Minwoo began dancing.  Dongwan: I bought The Dog and LuckMan…lok, lok, lok. Inside is my heart for everyone. It’s for the people I love. (kiss from The Dog)  Hyesung: Let’s Go!  Narrator: What did you buy?  Hyesung: I bought 2 dolls… yes… dolls… for my girlfriend…I’m with Lee JiHoon…  Dongwan: What? What with JiHoon? What the heck?  Hyesung: You might not think that I am pitiful…but without a girlfriend… sigh… I’ll leave it for my future girlfriend…  Eric: I bought 2 cellphones  Hyesung: Tell us why you bought 2!  Eric: One for me, one for my girlfriend!  Hyesung: …bleh…  Minwoo bought hat, so did JunJin. Junjin is wearing the one he just bought and is using the camera to fix it. Junjin…the always energetic one.  JunJin: Japanese and Korean fans are similar but Jap fans are very mature, when they see us, they won’t scream or yell. They also dress differently.  Jin noticed something.  JunJin: the girl in front has cool hair.   -vifz

       Today there's Brazil vs. US in male volleyball. Anyone gonna watch ? I'm looking forward not o miss it, since my ever-so-smart mom scheduled a doctor appointment for me at 14:30, and the game begins at 15:30 (14:30 Aly and Beebz's time). Oh yes, and if you do watch, pay attention to Giba. That guy  was  cute, but for some odd reason he let his hair grow that much and did the same with his facial hair... So now I just have to keep my eyes on Dante and Ricardinho, specially the last one (it's written RICARDO on his shirt). Anyway... Who do you think is gonna win ?       P.S: I'm feeling really stupid posting for the 3rd time in a row here...
