      PRINCE is the name we gave for my Persian kitten. He is so adorable & smart.Each time whenever we are unseen in his view he will start to "meow2".My goodness it is so irritating but after awhile he will remain silent,maybe because he's tired:) He is 4 months old, creamy fury with black oval eyes.  It's all because of my hubby whom is a pet lover. He used to keep fishes.The 1st time i know him he got a white AROWANA. Unfortunately,one fine morning we discovered that AROWANA jumped off the tank. It was too late for us to save him as he was long time dead. Since then, he have no mood to keep a fish due to dead Arowana. But i managed to pull him thru by pursuin him to buy new fishes & he did. Later then, he started worrying abt our electrical bill coz he have two tank with both using the electrical oxygen. That's when he decided to keep a persian kitten.  Hey, sometimes i wonder why human seems to dislike kitten nor cat whereas its the cleanest pet of all. Mama asked us to throw the pet before she comes to singapore again.Its so damn frustrated.I know it's their house but that doesnt mean that we know hoe to take care of the pet rite? Just bcoz of the "NASI BASI" she saw,that doesnt mean that i cant handle house cleaning rite?  Well,we decided to keep PRINCE.whenever my parents in law come to spore, my hubby will bring him out to work or stay at sam's hse. This will make the tie we rope btwn parents & son's drift apart abit.I wonder if there's a better solution......

      hi.....what a boring moring thursday!!It is supposed to be a happy day for me,with me having not enuf rest!!Arghhhh,I have nt been studying for quite sm tyms,its killing me!!Let me tell you a story abt me yesterday!!WHat does razali wants from me?I mean i told him "ok, fine if you wana play soccer back its up to you, but what most important ting is dat call his parents first b4 goin for his soccer. I dont wish to be blamed if anything happen to him.Isnt that fair enuf?  Sometyms i shldnt even care abt his health.Look!!When he called his mum & asked permission regarding him playing soccer as a goalkeeper, mama disagree & kept saying that he shldnt go coz of his health & also coz he got a family.Isnt that rite?  Then,he shldnt acted the way he did you see.....I dont like it wen mama kept reminding him he said in a disliking tone,YAHHHH!!what the hack?? I dont like children being rude towards their parents. None of his family members encounter "LOOSING A MUM eternity". I do, i mean i did. Its so hard to accept it you noe!!The scars are still inside me. Now that he's sleeping & iam alone with whatever iam doin, writing diary. Haizzzz, pls laaaa i am really sad sey!!  If i noe he's goin to be like dis, i wont want to intrude his life. Let it be if he will be wheelchaired!! Who cares rite? WHat important is that i be the one working & he satyed at hm alone. Then he will feel what arwah my mum felt thru the entire tym she's wheelchaired!!Its not easy. Yesh!!I am being so negative abt his playing soccer back. Lyk i said, setiap manusia yg allah jadikan mempunyai 2 laluan hidup.If you choose to play football again den you will have to bear with the conscequences of the road allah gave you. If you choose otherwise then it will be the other way round. You get what i mean??!!  I tink iam enuf of writing, i hate the way tings happened!!Is he still blind Allah??Why does he still have to be sad even?Cant he separate his emotion abt football??Evntho its been years he played, tere must be a valid reason to why allah tarik nikmat kaki kiri dia!!  Lindungi lah dier sentiasa!!Only you know whatever he's been doing!!

        Dear Diary,     What a night i have.....Yest i was alone at hm, accompanied by my PRINCE. Well, i didnt sleep till this morning 0600hrs.Wow!!Must be wondering what the hell iam doin rite? I was so called studying till the sun  urlLink rise.@1st  my notes wen smooth till i realised that PRINCE was quiet all the while. I was astonished & search him here &amp; there. Gladly to know that he was alright, sleeping peacfully behind the cupboard. Since then, i woke him & he simply cant resist of nt disturbing a single sec. I managed to do 7 essays. 7 seems abit tho to me coz i started doin it after watching  CITY OF ANGEL.           Nothing much happened to me, as planned we went out to PASIR RIS to buy all the important things for prince. You know things like, DRY FOOD, games &amp; bathing accessories. Soon after we finished shopping we head back hm with smiling faces, thingking of all the things we have bought for prince. He must be pretty excited to get new toy.          without taking a min away, we left home to town. Yah rite, Razali wanted to buy a LEVI'S JEANS & i was so called dragged to buy one either which iam delighted coz i been waiting anxiously to get new pants. I have no idea to why we actually we went to FAR EAST instead of TAKASHIMAYA. So, we already crossed the line &amp; guess what? Razali with his itchy leg wanted to go to the previous shop which last time we went there to get  AIR RIFT   shoe.(sign sign, no size). Guess what, i think this is the   4th AIR RIFT   he bought.           Sometimes i wonder if i voice out something, it will happen in a way IAM BEING A NOISY WIFE.Did you geddit? I mean if i cant voice might as well i keep my mouth shut & say no word. I wonder why he became such a nuisane to me....I dont understand y he have to keep insisting that  "iam BISING"......  Argh.....freaking pathetic....      I think the best way it to remain silent &amp; not to say a word at all. Let thing s be this way. If i cant tolerate it i will keep writing here. Its the best way. I release my tension here. MORON.......WHATEVER@@@@@-----          My night has been ruined by this stupid phrase---i mean, look!!dont get me wrong.I am trying to help you, so that you wont go far from wat you're supposed to do. He already hurt my feelings in the train by saying my compre is SUCK......right!!!!But i remain silent.....I know iam nt as clever as him but still i got feeling &amp; i took it as tho its nothing....i took it as a joke......whatever!!!!     ------------------ WHAT A NIGHT------------------

        Dear Diary,          My day was ok,nothing much happened!went to pick my CUTE PRINCE from boarding pet & zoommmm back home. Well,i &amp; razali are supposed to go out, but judging by the tym we decided to chill at home since we are waiting for our NEW TV SET & razali is working nite shift. Why does he have to work nite shift??          Yesterday, was a miraculios day. Why i said so coz things wen the way i so called want it to be. First & formost, i &amp; razali had a crucial conversation with his parents regarding abt his  STUDY   &   COMMITMENT.           Everyone is concern abt his study. He is really a WITTY guy you noe. I mean he's brilliant, smart & HANDSOME...hahah. well, actually he's supposed to further his studies last yr. He got a plc in Aussie Uni-- QUEENSLAND UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY--i hav no idea to why he decided to get married instead but alhamdulillah now his dreams is coming true. He's taking his PT degree in AEROSPACE ENGINEERING &amp; his final yr he will hav to be a   FULL TIME STUDENT in UNIVERSITY TECHNOLOGY OF SYDNEY.  It's a state UNI. Looks like i will hav to remain intact here if i were to join NIE next yr.           Other than that, we discussed abt HOUSE.oh yah, iam quite sad to release  DUXTON HSE   but we already set our mind nt stayin here that long either. Once razali graduated frm sydney, he will try to get a job thru the attachment company & started working while i be in spore studying as well. Once he's stable he will pay for my BOND with MOE.           I think everything went on smooth,alhamdulillah. Abah will pay half of $4,000 for 2 semester & the remaining which are 2 sem will be fullied paid by us. Studying in Aussie, looks like mama &amp; abah will pay for razali. I will help him with any needs he seek for in sydney later on.          Thanks allah for making everything goes smooth &amp; normal. I hope we can go thru all the hurdles that u shall give us Amin.....
