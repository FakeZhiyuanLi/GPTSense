      What a farce... 9-1... Crap... Played in a street-soccer competition today, and gave a J2 team a good drubbing... I guess it must have hurt them bad... Ouch... What's the point in playing in such lop-sided victories... Takes the fun out of the game... What about their feelings?&nbsp;Gosh... I shudder at the&nbsp;mere thought...&nbsp;But then again I'll hate to lose... Oh well... Life is full of paradoxes... Next time I'll stick to the exercise wheel... A much simpler way to work out... &nbsp; Hmmm... Her birthday today... Wondering what to do... Probably just stuff her with the gift and walk off... I really worry that she'll want for us to be back together again... Don't want nobody to get hurt... I just can't handle it... Clinical tests have proven time and again rats can't multi-task... &nbsp; Speaking of things weighing on the mind, there's this&nbsp;damnable creation&nbsp;called project work... If there is a hell (I really ought to discuss my views someday), it must be located within the basement of MOE... I can just&nbsp; see it... Pointy eared devils with their pointy tails, snivelling in delight as they&nbsp;dig their pointy snouts staring into a mystical mirror reflecting rats scurrying about&nbsp;trying pathetically to escape&nbsp;the new booby trap they designed in the grand maze of education... The " 'independent thought detected' button"&nbsp;featured in&nbsp;an episode in the Simpsons must have been another one of their magnificent contraptions... Feel so stifled... &nbsp; Oh well... My senior class angel is emigrating soon... Somehow she got to squeeze through the cage and get free... Or maybe my eyes are failing me, but are those bars in the distant horizon? Perhaps she just got to run around more, in a larger cage... Wheels within wheels within wheels, and&nbsp;cages within cages within cages... There's always a bigger picture...

      Read somebody else's blog today... In a sense it really "woke up my idea"... Haha... Concentrating on logging what I've done, and actually missed out that this is actually a great avenue for "shooting" people... Cool! Haha... Sound utterly moronic... But yeah I should&nbsp;tweak the style a bit... Up the use of language, turn on the sarcasm, and burn baby burn... &nbsp; Speaking of changes, I guess I ought to drop the super in front of rat... It's not that I didn't realise that I suck, its just that I kept holding on to the hope that maybe one day I wouldn't... No longer... I shall face up to the reality of the world, and humbly admit that there's really nothing special about me... Ordinary's fine thank you very much... Leave the big things to the big un's... I am content to sneak around in the gutters... At least I'm at home... &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Everything just seems to get caught up together in one big traffic jam doesn't it? Haiz... Another wasted weekend, wasted by useless, stupid activities. First, collected my O-level cert (finally, after such a long time), and got hit by a deluge of memories, few of them to my liking. Worse still, I met the two girls I had crushes on back then. Very the awkward. Life always has such unhappy coincidences.  So,&nbsp;with a "sian ji bua" sensation,&nbsp;I went back to school for a meaningless friendly against Paya Lebar CSC (you can tell by the name). We won, with minimal fuss, so much so captain had to make us&nbsp;work out more. Didn't play too badly for a change though. After that, I finally got to pia LAN after a long hiatus. Hmmm... Somehow the feeling has changed. Quite sian after a while. Must be the trip down memory lane. The next day, had to visit my grandmother, with aunts, uncles and cousins of course. They seem very happy to pinch my face every damn week. Sat there and smiled. Should be numb by now. Oh well. When I finally got away, it was PW time again. More enjoyable this time. Went around parts of Jurong area taking pictures. Could have done the job myself. But support was always welcome; one looks like an extremely misguided tourist when he takes pictures of elevators and ramps. Later, when everyone else has gone, I was left alone at last. Scampered around JP to search for her birthday gift. Two voices constantly screamed at each other within me: "Come on, you're no longer with her, so why buy that expensive piece of $l-l!+?" and "Hey, you miser, you can do better than that!" Oh well... I guess I went for the middle ground in the end. No point starving myself (though I suspect I still will),&nbsp;but I couldn't possibly just give her anything. Wondered how some people can treat some other people so well. They must be mad. Or they just aren't rats. &nbsp;

       urlLink http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/think/story/0,4386,262031,00.html  &nbsp;  What the modern woman wants   THE old woman sat in the back seat of the magenta convertible as it careened down the highway, clutching tightly the plastic bag on her lap, afraid it might be kidnapped by the wind.   She was not used to such speed. With trembling hands she pulled the seat belt tighter but was careful not to touch the patent leather seats with her calloused fingers. Her daughter had warned her not to dirty it: 'Fingerprints show very clearly on white, Ma.'  Her daughter, Bee Choo, was driving and talking on her sleek silver mobile phone using big words the old woman could barely understand. 'Finance', 'liquidation', 'assets', 'investments'. Her voice was crisp and important and had an unfamiliar lilt to it. Her Bee Choo sounded like one of those foreign girls on television. She was speaking in an American accent. The old lady clucked her tongue in disapproval.  'I absolutely cannot have this. We have to sell!' Her daughter exclaimed agitatedly as she stepped on the accelerator; her perfectly manicured fingernails gripping onto the steering wheel in irritation.  'I can't DEAL with this anymore!' she yelled as she clicked the phone shut and hurled it angrily towards the back seat. The mobile phone hit the old woman on the forehead and nestled soundlessly into her lap. She calmly picked it up and handed it to her daughter.  'Sorry, Ma,' she said, losing the American pretense and switching to Mandarin. 'I have a big client in America. There have been a lot of problems.' The old lady nodded knowingly. Her daughter was big and important.  Bee Choo stared at her mother from the rear view mirror, wondering what she was thinking. Her mother's wrinkled countenance always carried the same cryptic look. The phone began to ring again, an artificially cheerful digital tune, which broke the awkward silence.  'Hello Beatrice! Yes, this is Elaine.'  Elaine. The old woman cringed. I didn't name her Elaine. She remembered her daughter telling her how an English name was very important for 'networking', Chinese ones being easily forgotten.  'Oh no, I can't see you for lunch today. I have to take the Ancient Relic to the temple for her weird daily prayer ritual.'  Ancient Relic. The old woman understood perfectly it was referring to her. Her daughter always assumed that her mother's silence meant she did not comprehend. 'Yes, I know! My car seats will be reeking of joss sticks!'  The old woman pursed her lips tightly, her hands gripping her plastic bag in defence. The car curved smoothly into the temple courtyard. It looked almost garish next to the dull sheen of the ageing temple's roof. The old woman got out of the back seat and made her unhurried way to the main hall. Her daughter stepped out of the car in her business suit and stilettos and reapplied her lipstick as she made her brisk way to her mother's side.  'Ma, I'll wait outside. I have an important phone call to make,' she said, not bothering to hide her disgust at the pungent fumes of incense.  The old lady hobbled into the temple hall and lit a joss stick. She knelt down solemnly and whispered her now-familiar daily prayer to the gods.  'Thank you, God of the Sky, you have given my daughter luck all these years. Everything I prayed for, you have given her. She has everything a young woman in this world could possibly want. She has a big house with a swimming pool, a maid to help her, as she is too clumsy to sew or cook. Her love life has been blessed; she is engaged to a rich and handsome angmoh (dialect for Caucasian man).  'Her company is now the top financial firm and even men listen to what she says. She lives the perfect life. You have given her everything except happiness.  'I ask that the gods be merciful to her even if she has lost her roots while reaping the harvest of success.  'What you see is not true, she is a filial daughter to me. She gives me a room in her big house and provides well for me. She is rude to me only because I affect her happiness. A young woman does not want to be hindered by her old mother. It is my fault.'  The old lady prayed so hard that tears welled up in her eyes.  Finally, with her head bowed in reverence, she planted the half-burnt joss stick into an urn of smouldering ashes. She bowed once more.  The old woman had been praying for her daughter for 32 years. When her abdomen was round like a melon, she came to the temple and prayed that it was a son.  Then the time was ripe and the baby slipped out of her womb, bawling and adorable with fat thighs and pink cheeks, but unmistakably a girl.  Her husband had kicked and punched her for producing a useless baby who could not work or carry the family name.  Still, the woman returned to the temple with her new-born girl tied to her waist in a sarong and prayed that her daughter would grow up and have everything she ever wanted. Her husband left her and she prayed that her daughter would never have to depend on a man.  She prayed every day that her daughter would be a great woman, the woman that she, meek and uneducated, could never become. A woman with nengkan; the ability to do anything she set her mind to. A woman who commanded respect in the hearts of men. When she opened her mouth to speak, precious pearls would fall out and men would listen.  She will not be like me, the woman prayed as she watched her daughter grow up and drift away from her, speaking a language she scarcely understood. She watched her daughter transform from a quiet girl, to one who openly defied her, calling her laotu (old-fashioned in Chinese). She wanted her mother to be 'modern', a word so new there was no Chinese word for it.  Now her daughter was too clever for her and the old woman wondered why she had prayed like that. The gods had been faithful to her persistent prayer, but the wealth and success that poured forth so richly had buried the girl's roots and now she stood, faceless, with no identity, bound to the soil of her ancestors by only a string of origami banknotes.  Her daughter had forgotten her mother's values. Her wants were so ephemeral; that of a modern woman. Power, wealth, access to the best fashion boutiques, and yet her daughter had not found true happiness.  The old woman knew that you could find happiness with much less. When her daughter leaves the earth, everything she has will count for nothing. People would look to her legacy and say that she was a great woman, but she would be forgotten once the wind blows over, like the ashes of burnt paper convertibles and mansions.  The old woman wished she could go back and erase all her big hopes and prayers for her daughter; now she had only one want: that her daughter be happy. She looked out of the temple gate. She saw her daughter speaking on the phone, her brow furrowed with anger and worry.  Being at the top is not good, the woman thought. There is only one way to go from there - down. The old woman carefully unfolded the plastic bag and spread out a packet of beehoon (rice vermicelli) in front of the altar.  Her daughter often mocked her for worshipping porcelain gods. How could she pray to them so faithfully and expect pieces of ceramic to fly to her aid? But her daughter had her own gods too - idols of wealth, success and power that she was enslaved to and worshipped every day of her life. Every day was a quest for the idols, and the idols she worshipped counted for nothing in eternity. All the wants her daughter had would slowly suck the life out of her, and leave her an empty soulless shell at the altar.  The old lady watched her joss stick. The dull heat had left a teetering grey stem that was on the danger of collapsing. Modern women nowadays, the old lady sighed in resignation, as she bowed to the east one final time to end her ritual. Modern women nowadays want so much that they lose their souls and wonder why they cannot find it.  Her joss stick disintegrated into a soft grey powder. She met her daughter outside the temple, the same look of worry and frustration was etched on her daughter's face. An empty expression, as if she was ploughing through the soil of her wants looking for the one thing that would sow the seeds of happiness.  They climbed into the convertible in silence and her daughter drove along the highway, this time not as fast as she had done before.  'Ma,' Bee Choo finally said. 'I don't know how to put this. Mark and I have been talking about it and we plan to move out of the big house. The property market is good now, and we managed to find a buyer willing to pay seven million for it. We decided we'd prefer a cosier penthouse apartment instead. We found a perfect one in Orchard Road. Once we move in to our apartment, we plan to get rid of the maid, so we can have more space to ourselves...'  The old woman nodded knowingly.  Bee Choo swallowed hard. 'We'd get someone to come in to do the housework and we can eat out - but once the maid is gone, there won't be anyone to look after you. You will be awfully lonely at home and besides that, the apartment is rather small. There won't be space. We thought about it for a long time, and we decided the best thing for you is if you moved to a home. There's one near Hougang, it's a Christian home, a very nice one.'  The old woman did not raise an eyebrow.  'I've been there, the matron is willing to take you in. It's beautiful with gardens and lots of old people to keep you company! I hardly have time for you, you'd be happier there. You'd be happier there, really.' Her daughter repeated as if to affirm herself.  This time, the old woman had no plastic bag of food offerings to cling tightly to; she bit her lip and fastened her seat belt, as if it would protect her from a daughter who did not want her anymore. She sunk deep into the leather seat, letting her shoulders sag, and her fingers traced the white seat.  'Ma?' her daughter asked, searching the rear view mirror for her mother. 'Is everything okay?'  What had to be done, had to be done. 'Yes,' she said firmly, louder than she intended. 'If it will make you happy,' she added more quietly.  'It's for you Ma! You'll be happier there. You can move there tomorrow. I already got the maid to pack your things,' Elaine said triumphantly, mentally ticking yet another item off her agenda.  'I knew everything would be fine.'  Elaine smiled widely; she felt liberated. Perhaps getting rid of her mother would make her happier. She had thought about it. It seemed the only hindrance in her pursuit of happiness. She was happy now.  She had everything a modern woman ever wanted: money, status, career, love, power and now, freedom, without her mother and her old-fashioned ways to weigh her down - yes, she was free.  Her phone buzzed urgently; she picked it up and read the message, still beaming from ear to ear. 'Stocks 10-per-cent increase!' Yes, things were definitely beginning to look up for her...  And while searching for the meaning of life in the luminance of her handphone screen, the old woman in the back seat became invisible, and she did not see the tears. &nbsp; Sia la...

      Hmmm... New to this blogging business... But figured perhaps it could help in my writing ability, so here I am... Perhaps stuff would get progressively better... Well... Another day in the life of a lab rat... I mean, we're like running around blindly, for some unseen purpose... Tried to twist some people to my cause, get them to do something crazy, but failed as usual... Can't blame them, nor myself... They (best-case senario) learn something during lessons, but I struggle to stay awake... Pointless point... Ah... But after school was measurably better...&nbsp;Though not by much...&nbsp;Played football, then basketball, worked up a sweat, but still got thrashed... Felt lousy, then filled with determination to do better next time... Hmmm... Reminds me of something... Argh... Can't remember... Don't want to either... It'll pass, like all things else... However, it got really sian afterwards... The whole Basketball gang, including J2 seniors went to Coro, hoping to catch some Tenderfresh, then the mandatory LAN session... But well, Auntie was closing liao, and the LAN shop was full... Spirits crushed in a spectacular double whammy... In the end a rather solitary ride home on the bus... Can't help feeling morose... I guess I'll stop here... Not sure what else to say... Except maybe that life really sucks... Doesn't it?

      To: Whoever was interested and peered in  Sorry, got caught up with digging a hole and trying to escape the cage... Okay, blatant lie... Hmmm... I think I was just existing... No thought, no movement, just lay down there, except for nutrition bit I guess I could qualify as a non-living thing... Oh well... The "big maze test" is coming up soon... Got to try out the puzzles the scientist kindly placed in the cage (or rather, shoved in my face), and get in shape... Or else... An eternity of being injected by chemicals? Rat stew? Invitation to a feline dinner party? (Speaking of which, they have Batman, Catwomen, Spiderman, but all we got is Pinky and the Brain... Damn...)  But at least there's company... My fellow cadre aren't too bad at all... Still, I guess I have to work on my social skills a bit... Kind of became rusty? Realised I don't know too many mice as I used to... A feeling of... Hmmm... Sadness? But I've never been the kind to reach out... Oh well... Whatever will be will be... (Yesh... I miss her... Sh-ucks... (Learnt the meaning of that today)) Guess the company's not enough... (Discounting our dear old "good buddies", who are recently given the free reign to walk about...)  I'll end with a promise... I'll try to update... However small and inefficient rat paws are handling the keyboard... Till then... Toodles...
