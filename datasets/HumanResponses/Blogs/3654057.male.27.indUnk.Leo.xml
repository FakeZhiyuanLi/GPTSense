      Taxes What else is my concern with this great nation of ours you ask?  Taxes and class warfare.  Taxes, my thought the income tax is horrible.  It is a rob from those who are productive to give to those who are not.  One word, enabling.  Two words, buying votes.  It is a numbers game.   A quick question for you for you to think about;  If you walked out of a bank after payday, and someone across the street walked up to you and punched you in the face and took $20.00 of every $100.00 you had, but then walked to a church and gave that money to them, is that right or wrong?  Well, what is the difference on payday?  The Government is punching you in the face to give the money to someone else they deem more in need of the money than you. I think it is fair to say the “less than wealthy” people in this country far out number the wealthy people.  A divide and conquer approach is taken.  How do you divide Americans? You create the “haves” and “have nots” and foster the mentality the “have nots” do not have because of the “haves.”  If the “haves” were not so greedy the “have nots” would enjoy a better life.  You create social injustices and put the blame on the “haves.”  You make Americans believe it is not the choices they have made, such as drugs, alcohol, or dropping out of school that has created the financial and social separations in life, you tell these “have nots” it is the “haves” fault you dropped out of school, have become a drug addict or an alcoholic, it is not your fault, it is the “haves” fault.  Once again we come back to taking responsibility for your life when it is easier to blame some one else for the poor choices you have made.    So if you can get those without to vote you in, on the basis you can take from those who have to give to those who have not, well then, you may have enough votes to move to D.C.  Also, we need to be careful when it comes to bills which create more “have nots.”  What do I mean?  Well, there have been several attempts to abolish income, property, and sales taxes for “certain people,” such as teachers and social workers.  This has mainly been in the California Area, but has made its way to D.C. on occasion.  Now this is fantastic if you are part of the chosen, but if you are not, you are now left with a bigger bill than before to pay.   So why select teachers and social workers?  Well, they do “good humane work” and do not receive high compensation, usually, and the teachers union is the largest voting union in the nation.  So you have created a “feel good campaign” on paper, and created a large voting base in reality.  Once you have all teachers and social workers voting in your favor, you move onto government employees perhaps, giving them the same deal.   This creates a bigger bill for the rest of us, and almost guarantees certain politicians never get voted out of office and certain political agendas get past regularly.  If you got 60% of the American Workforce in your back pocket, along with those who do not work to begin with, you will never again lose an election.  Forget fairness to all, in this case only numbers matter. Imagine when the county was 2 years old, someone approaching Thomas Jefferson, Samuel Adams, George Washington and say “Here is the deal, we are going to demand you give some of the wealth you earned today to us so we may give it to someone who is not working.”  I think you already know what the answer and the following threats may have been, which is the reason it most likely why it never happened.  So knowing this and looking at today, what I see is a complete 180.   At one point, society collects the bare minimum to survive with structure and law enforcement, to ensure against chaos.  Now we see a lets give away the house and create a new society.  A “what do wee need to collect from those who have to do so” mentality. Interestingly you hear politicians talking about tax cuts for “the middle class, the working class, those who need it..”  Sound familiar?  Re-read that statement and think about what you see wrong with that phrase.  Now hopefully you read it again and came to the same conclusion I have done.  If not, that is okay we will get to this statement, but lets move on. Here is what I see with that statement and all others like it.  Who are they talking about?  There is never a defined parameter.  No definition of the middle class.  What is the middle class?  $30,000 a year?  40? 50? 60? 100?  No one says it, because then they are held to a standard, a benchmark, accountability at a later date.  And we all know the last thing anyone wants is accountability.  We vote our accountability away. Those in D.C. try to pass their poor decisions onto the other political party, “it would have worked if ‘they” cooperated,” “ I never tried so hard in my life to get “this” to work, but “the other party” just did not want “it” to succeed.”   When you first read that statement from before about middle class tax cuts, you most likely thought you were included in “the middle class.”  You most likely assumed I was talking about you.  The tax cut sounds great, deserved, and will be welcomed.  But what if I said, tax cuts will only be given to those who earn, gross, less than $25,000 per year.  Now you can form an opinion about my plan.  And why is the middle class getting tax cuts?  Well, from the most recent figures I have seen, the upper class starts at $50,000 per year.   Yes, you read that right, our representatives in D.C. feel if you earn, gross, more than $50,000 a year, you are in the wealthy class.  So cutting taxes on the “middle class” really does not hurt the financial income of the government.  Cutting taxes from those who do not pay very much in the first place, means you do not loose much in the end. And most of you (but not everyone I know) would probably vote for the person pushing for the “middle class” tax cut, for no other reason than, you assume you are in the “middle class” and would benefit from the tax relief.   Not to dwell on this too much, but those flakes in Hollywood, those who tell us they are going to give back their “unnecessary” tax return in protest and encourage all of us to do the same.  Well, I never see or hear of any of them actually returning the money, do you?  And two, when you earn 100 million a year, I think you could afford to live off of 60 million.  Not that you should surrender that much of your earnings, but think about it, you could live comfortably.  But what if you earned 100 thousand, and had to afford to live on 60,000.  You could surely, but still at this level of income tax relief would be more noticeable than at 60,000,000.00.   So the question is not survival on the money, 60,000 a year is a nice net income, the question becomes should you have to?  Should you have to surrender 40% of your time to someone else?  There are 480 minutes in an 8 hour work day.  Now most of you work more than 8 hours I know, but lets just use this as our example.  Of 480 minutes per day and 28% tax rate, you are surrendering 135 minutes per day to someone else.  The first 135 minutes of your day, you are handing over your wage to someone else.   The question now moves from is this right, to when will it stop?  When will we say, as the working class, enough already!  ENOUGH!  No more, this is my time, and I have a right to the fruits of my labor, no one else.  40%? 50%? 60%?  When as voters, as laborers, is enough, and what is the appropriate amount of time surrendered to society?  Well I would say the appropriate amount is the amount in which you personally benefit.  You benefit from police, fire dept. EMS, courts, a military, and other societal structure.  Structure is the key here, systems in place to provide stability and structure protecting the everyday freedoms and liberties of individuals. My belief is in abolishing the income tax all together, it is wrong.  But if we as a culture, as a nation decide this is the best way for us to provide the structure, then I would say no more than 10% should be surrendered.  If the government cannot function and perform its’ duties with that amount of money, then they can change to make sure it gets done, or they can loose their job.   Why 10% well, if you consider the fact 50% of all the money collected through income tax at the government level is lost, yes that is right, lost.  Then right there says to me, the government is not only inefficient, but they are charging us double to get the job done.  With all the tax rebates and loop holes, and the fact 50% of what is actually collected is gone within a few months, then I say cut the air to the fire, remove the oxygen, cut the money collected, stolen, from us in half.  Shape up or ship out I say.   Think about this for a moment.  When you are looking at what you want to do in your life.  Consider these for instance a vacation, buying a car, going out to dinner for your anniversary, clothes, house hold items and all the other ins and outs you need to pay for during the year.  You need to consider these expenses and look at your income to decide what it is you are going to do and what you cannot do, or what you need to save for, what you will never be able to afford in the next few years.   Do you go to your boss and say, pay me double so I can do all the things I want to! Or do you realize you “only” have so much money and  you will need to figure out what you need to accomplish now and prioritize your expenses against your income.   Well the government should be no different.  We should say, as tax payers, this is it, this is all you get, make it work, and if you do a good job, maybe, maybe, just maybe in a decade we will consider giving you a raise. See, if it were up to me, I would abolish the income tax all together.  Gone.  Gone tomorrow, but, I would say sales tax on non-necessity items is raised by 10%. Now what do I mean by that?  Well if we eliminated of the income tax, most of us would have a 12% raise tomorrow.  Payroll taxes, or income tax is around 12%.  Items such as food, clothing and shelter would not be taxable items. I would say the first 200,000 of a home is not taxable and the first 25,000 of a car is not taxable.  After that you would pay sales tax and property tax on the remaining value. This means if you want a new car every 3 years, you will pay the increased sales tax, you want a new big screen plasma television for every room in your house, you will pay the increased sales tax.  This also means if your 1995 Honda is running okay, and your television from 1998 is okay with you, you have just received a 12% raise.  If you want to invest the money great, investing money helps the economy, in turn helping others.   I also feel the senior citizens in this country would greatly benefit from this system.  Currently, each year they must pay income tax, money earned from their investments, all along they are not truly “working,” as they are retired.  We see an increasing demand to care for the elderly, as they are seeing increases to their lives daily.  Well, the best way to do so is allow them to control their expenses.   As you know most seniors do not buy a new car every other year, they drive the same automobile for 10 years, they watch the same television for 10 years, they live in the same house for 30 years.  So, buy not spending their money on “luxury” items, they would be able to pay for their annual health care needs when not having to worry over paying income tax on money they earned years ago and paid taxes on then.   But once again a certain risk is taken into account here, what if a senior foolishly spends their money on, using a stereotype, bingo cards instead of prescription medications?  Well then that senior better hope his or her children will foot the bill, because due to his or her poor choice they will not get the money to do so from the rest of society. In essence, we would be taking care of people by affording them the means and opportunity to care for themselves.  If they are unable to make good choices and do this on their own, they are in trouble, and it is nobody’s fault other than their own.  Personal accountability. If you want to spend the money, great, you just got something for your money, a boat, or a vacation, fantastic, spending money helps the economy, buying boats and going on vacation helps keep people employed.  That guy who puts the leather on the boat seat or the gas clerk who you got fuel for your trip to Florida have a purpose and a job.  They then will have money to invest or spend as they see fit. If you decide to save the money, fantastic, when you are a bit older a need some health care, you will have money to pay for your services.   The point is, it is your money, your money to choose what you want to do with it.  Pay off a loan, pay for your continuing education, pay for your child to go to college, pay for a family vacation, give it to the red cross, give it to the salvation army, give it to the urban outdoorsman begging for change. You decide, not someone else.   But again, with this way of thinking, you alone will be held accountable for your decisions.  If you decide to gamble all your money away, you will not have any food to eat.  If you buy a car you cannot afford you may be evicted from your home.  With freedom comes personal responsibility.  And with freedom and responsibility comes the potential for success and the risk of failure.  Making good choices will be the difference between the two. Believe me when I say this, if capital hill had to rely on the economics of this country to collect its’ revenue, we would have nothing but positive economic policy.  There is a tie between politics and economics, Jude Waninski calls it “polyconomics,” as you truly can not separate politics and economics. 	With this in mine, if we moved our country towards a sales tax income for the public sector of business, everybody would benefit, not just those who need the government support.  Think for a moment, congress received all their income from the tax revenue of consumer spending.  Do you really think for a second congress would do anything to hinder spending?  No, not for a second.  In fact, you would see politicians campaigning under economic policies to increase spending to increase government revenues allowing more and more government funded programs.  This is the way the government should get its funding.   	If congress passed bills increasing taxes above certain acceptable levels by consumers on goods, spending would slow down, thus slowing down the income of the government and resulting in their social programs being cut.  But if they had good economic policy, spending would continue, resulting in jobs, resulting in those families spending, resulting in higher revenues to the government.   	Now as a consumer, you should not worry what the government does with their tax money.  You got the goods and services you desire, the government got the revenue they need.  If politicians campaign on certain platforms, then do not deliver they will most likely be removed from office at the next election.  So it is in their best interest to tie the two (politics and economics) together.   	Good economic policy helps the consumer who does not benefit from the social program, and good economic policy creates the necessary revenues to provide the funding for the social program.  Therefore those who utilize and need these programs will benefit from the good economic policies the consumer desires.  And consumers will feel good buying the goods and services knowing they are helping those in need, creating jobs for others, and enjoying their purchase, whatever it may be.

      this is a few thougths from what I'm doing right now...  ===  Politicians Politicians are not necessarily bad people from the start, years of tainted funds and shady agreements turn all of them to the dark side.  As Jerry Garcia once said “Just because you choose the lesser of two evils, it doesn’t necessarily make it a good choice.”  That’s our political system in a nut shell.  Once again, we, as voters, do have some responsibility.  We, as voters, buy into the fact, inherently perhaps, allowing other to make tough decisions for us is better than doing the decision making on our own.  I guess the fact when it goes baldly we can point the finger at someone else?  But remember when you point  a finger in someone else’s direction, you will have three pointing back at you.  Politicians sell us the thought they can make a positive difference, the can make a right out of a wrong, they should be given the power to ensure and assure our lives are fair and just.  We buy into this tale, send the best story teller to political office with the means to deliver a nightmare over and over again.  The alarm must go off soon, time for us to wake up.  Just like lawyers, politicians can not, do not, and will not solve problems.  They will contain and improve to a certain degree, only showing progress, never completion. In reality they cannot complete the tasks they have been elected to do. No problems means no platform for re-elections, which is most crucial to a politician, re-election.  The scare tactic is “if you remove me from my office, we will loose ground on all I have accomplished.  You surely do not want to risk all of this progress, do you?”   Could you imagine, for a second, if at your work you never solved issues after 10, 20, or even 30 years?  Would you still have a job?   I feel politicians in D.C. or at least in the house, should not be full time jobs.  Yes I said it, congress should be part time.  Why you ask?  Everyday they are in session they pass, enact, decline, overturn, or filibuster issues which restrict our individual freedoms. I do not believe 80% of this would happen if being a congressperson were a part time job, with term limits.  What do you think would happen if the people creating laws and regulations had to live in the community and make a living within these restrictions? Answer: They would only propose and pass bills which would ensure their stability and help them to thrive in their life.  I can not think anyone would pass a bill which would hinder their daily lives and ability to earn an honest living.   You see, right now, politicians do not care about you and your family.  They care about themselves, their family, and their re-elections.  But can you blame them?  No, I do not blame them. In our system, this is the only way they can thrive. But when politicians do not have to survive and thrive in the world they create, that is not fair to the individuals who are electing them.   Most people feel we live in a democracy.  This is a lie, we live in a representative republic.  It does not say “I pledge allegiance to the flag, of the united states of America, and to the democracy for which it stands…”  No, it says to the republic. And this gets back to my point.  These politicians are suppose to be representing us in D.C.  They are there to speak on our half.  This is the only way anything could get done with a country this size.   But when you have people representing special interest groups instead of people, you have to wonder why?  Well, in order to keep their job in congress, politicians must get funding to run ad campaigns either promoting what they have done, or bashing what the person they are trying to steal their job has done.   Either way, I have not mentioned the voter.  Why do we need these campaigns anyway?  If the person we are electing to represent us actually lived in the community which they were representing then shouldn’t we already know them?   What I see being created here is nothing short of a hierarchy.  We have said to ourselves, “Those who we elect are the elite, and they are better than us, so go to Rome and do us proud.”  What I do not understand is why?   Maybe it is because we elect them?  We assume they are better than us, they understand “things” we just could never grasp?  Once again, some of the blame is on our shoulders here.  We pay more attention to the pathetic lives of “celebrities” whom we over idolize than our politicians daily lives.  This should be the other way around.  Celebrities have no control over the laws which affect us, they have no control over the direction of our country.  They may think they do, and with the way we blindly follow them, perhaps via our allegiance they do, but not via our constitution.  We should demand a weekly update from our representatives, we should see how they are representing us constantly not just at campaign time.   Could you imagine at your place of work, whoever you supervise, you had no idea what they were doing?  You had no clue.  What do you think would happen?  How productive would those people be?  Would they be working for your best interest, or their own? I would be willing to bet the job would get done around evaluation (or election) time when you are paying a bit more attention.  The same thing happens in politics, nobody really knows what is going on, we do not demand to know.  Those are our employees, politicians work for us and everyday they are creating bills which restrict our daily lives.  Every day they are demanding more and more of our time to pay for programs which will keep them employed and like mindless sheep we go to get sheered. Forget who is dating who in Hollywood, who cares?  Who cares, why do you care? Stop caring!  Look at the other coast as your freedoms and liberties are being systematically destroyed with smiles, bumper sticker slogans, and false promises.  Politicians have been cutting away at the constitution for decades with one hand and spoon feeding us as we get fat and lazy with the other.   Soon, when we can no longer get up without their help, we will be cut off and held hostage, and when we turn to the constitution to defend us, we will realize the scary truth, it has been manipulated, cut and twisted into a document no longer protecting our freedoms, but protecting the livelihood of those on capital hill.  We are letting the greatest document of freedom in the history of this planted go unprotected every day we do not demand more accountability from our representatives.   The Constitution is supposed to be simple document.  A document laying the groundwork for those in Government by stating “This is all that you can do,” and protecting the citizens by saying “This is all that you can not do.”  The Constitution sets limits and parameters for the Government while giving much freedom and liberty to the citizens.  As citizens, we cannot have it both ways.  We must understand the Governments hands are supposed to be tied, and those on the hill are not to be providing and decision making in our daily lives.   Our Country was founded on hard work and self ownership of one’s skills producing a living.  In essence, you are responsible for yourself and your family, not your neighbor or neighborhood, unless you decide that is what you want to do.  What I see our Federal Government do everyday is a crime against the foundation of this country in my humble opinion. What else about politicians gets under my skin you ask?  Another issue is with spending at the federal level.  Spend, spend, spend, buy votes this seems to be the motto of every politician.  My issue is how inefficient our politicians are.  They have no accountability, no oversight, no one is auditing and reporting back to us, the tax payer who, what and where the money is going. Statistically the government is going to lose 50% of the money it collects from us.  50%.  50% of the money taken from you each two weeks will be lost.  Think about this.  That money was promised to someone, some group, some social program.  And more than likely you as the tax payer are okay with paying the tax knowing the money is going to good use.  Now we can debate if this is good use until the cows come home, so for the sake of this argument, lets assume you and I agree the money is suppose to be funding a program we feel is necessary. But half of the money never reaches the program?  Let’s look at it this way.  You are the parent and you feel bad for your neighbor, they have lost their job recently.  You decide to pay their phone bill, which is $40.00 per month.  It is your “pay the phone bill” program.  And you are willing and egger to fund this program.  So you give your child $40.00 each month and say, “son, please give this $40.00 to the smith’s next door. Tell them it is for their phone bill. Thank you, you are such a good child, caring and trustworthy.”  I added that last part for fun.   Then one day you run into the smith’s, let’s say at the store.  They wish to say, thank you for the $20.00 each month, it was truly appreciated and extremely helpful.   You then say, “20?  I sent 40 each month, did you not get 40 from me?”  The Smith’s say, “no, I got 20, and it was great, but I never got 40.”   You now feel the churning in the pit of your stomach.  That feeling is betrayal and dishonesty.  You know for a fact you gave 40 each month and the smith’s are claiming they received only 20.  Who does this leave?  Well you go to your son and say son, “I gave you 40 each month to give to the smith’s, but they are telling me you only gave them 20.  Is this so?”  Your son, who cannot lie, says “yes it is true.”  You rightfully ask, “where did the other money go?’  Your son says “I do not know, I lost it on the way.”   “You lost it?’ “Yes, I lost the money” “What do you mean you lost it?” ‘Well, I just do not know where it went, so you are going to have to give me 80 a month in order to pay for the $40.00 phone bill.” “Why do I need to give you $80 to pay for a $40 phone bill?’ “Because I will loose half of what you give to me, because I do not do a good job of keeping track of the money.  But we cannot let the smith’s go without a phone, so you need to just give me more money to make sure the smith’s keep their phone.” 	This is what we are dealing with as taxpayers, children who cannot keep track of their allowance.  Only the U.S. government looses billions a year, looses, not miss-spends, or expenses that just were not budgeted for.  We hear our representatives say, “We are not sure where the 300 million or (300,000,000.00) went.  Well you had better find out, and quickly, because you are not getting a penny more from me until you do so.   	How do you fix this?  Simple, the solution is to have a financial services department.  All the tax revenue collected by the IRS is audited by the department.  Any time a social program needs the money it has been promised the representative submits and invoice to be paid.  You then can keep track of what is coming in and going out, leading us to this check and balance system.  Quarterly the financial department will release financial statements, a balance sheet, statement of operations, etc. published in every major newspaper in the country as well as available online.  This means you, as tax payers, can access our government spending and see where the money is going.   	You can ensure the money you agreed to pay to a certain social program is getting there in its entirety.  What am I getting at here?  Accountability.  If a politician says they are going to give your tax money to a certain social program, you should be able to see how much went there, and when it was paid.  You should be able to see how much your representatives are receiving as a salary, how much their health insurance is costing you, what their raise in pay has been over the years.  Then once election time comes around, you will be able to decide if 1. this person did what they said they were going to, and 2. do you agree with what they are doing.  Accountability.  We need to demand this from our representatives, and not just take their word for it.  	Anything else you may be asking?  Well yes as a matter-of-fact.  Politicians as I’ve said really do not care about us. They only want our vote.  Now this is not entirely a bad thing.  You see if a politician only wants our vote, then they will be compelled to do what it takes to get our vote.  If we as voters allow politicians to get away with false promises, then the onus is on us.  However, if the politician truly accomplishes what they say they will, simply because they are after votes, that is not necessarily a bad thing.   The worst scenario is when a politician says they will work for us towards a certain goal, does not accomplish the goal, has no reason for not accomplishing the goal, and to top it off does not feel it to be necessary to inform the voters as to why.  With this, we have a problem.  I use politicians to get my voice heard and my agenda passed, they use me for a job.  It is a working relationship not based on trust, but on results, it is for the most part a business relationship.  The business in this case is human events.  What seriously annoys me, politicians who claim to be for minority rights.  I am the politician for Black rights, or Hispanic rights, or Eskimo rights, gay rights, or a combination of the above.  You see, what this person is trying is a divide and conquer.   They know how many votes it will take to gain political office.  Then assume getting votes in bulk, or groups, will be easier than getting them one by one.  Unfortunately today this is true, the MTV generation does not really care to pay attention to the political stage, unless underwear or inhaling and exhaling techniques are being discussed.  So the political strategy is to get votes in bulk, segregate the population into groups and campaign on behalf of those group rights.   We then find a mentality of association which has been instilled in us since we started school.  We, as voters, through decades of schooling, want to belong to groups.  Group mentality is the way to go, what is best for the group is what is important.  So if this person is going to make things better for Hispanics, and I am Hispanic, then I must vote for this person.  I have no clue what the person is going to do once in office, I just know he cares about Hispanics and that is me.   So the problem I see is, politicians do not care about minorities, they care about groups.  Politicians do not care about me as an individual, for I am only one vote, but if they can persuade me to join a group, preferably one they claim to be in favor of, then I am worth more than just one vote, I become “another” vote.  I am to associate with my group on the basis of my appearance or sexuality.   Why?  Because those traits are the most easily associated traits people tend to identify themselves with.  Do I look and/or act like everyone else.  If you have a black man in a room of black people, he will feel part of the group as he is no different than anyone else.  This country which was founded on the basis of a melting pot of cultures is now trying to separate the pot back into the ingredients.   We, as voters, are overlooking the big picture here.  You, an individual, are the ultimate minority.  There is no other you, you are a group of 1 in 6 billion.  You as a voter should not be concerned about the group politicians are trying to lump you into, you as a voter should be concerned about YOU!  You should demand policies which benefit YOU! Not some faceless group you had no choice in joining.  If you are black, Hispanic, Asian, male, female, you did not chose to be that, you are that person.  You should demand a better life, not for blacks, Hispanics, whites, males, females, Asians, or Eskimos, but demand a better life for YOU!  Find the politician who wants to promote individual freedom, individual rights, and you have just found the politician who is truly fighting for the ultimate minority, YOU.

      bonnaroo '04 wasn't too shabby thanks to a great set by the dead, mule and suprising me, dave and friends (thanks to trey and tim for that).  Although, last years was, in my opininon still better.    my case, last year (2003) we had neil young, ben harper, jack johnson, bela fleck and the flecktones, allman brothers, widespread panic, and james brown.  None of which were present during 2004.    We picked up Dave Matthews, Bob Dylan, and Govn't Mule.  All fantastic, but it's hard to carry that big of a tourch.  But the company was good, the eye candy a bit better this year (probably because of Dave, but I'm not going to complain).  The traffic was worse, due to 10,000 more people.  But you will find me there again, I'm the guy giving away music and tequila.  If you are the guy who lost his lunch on our tire, sorry about that, or if you are one of the two girls who took the huge shot of tequila at our camp site... you are a goddess...
