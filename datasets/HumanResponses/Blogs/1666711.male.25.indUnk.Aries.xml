       urlLink Firefox Help: Tips & Tricks  This advanced tip makes it possible to run Firefox from removable media, such as a USB memory stick. This will allow you to run Firefox with your personal settings from any computer, even those that don't have Firefox installed. It has only been tested on Windows XP/2000. The basic instructions are as follows:     1. Copy the Firefox application folder and your profile folder to the removable media. In this example we will use R:\Firefox for the application folder and R:\FFProfile as the profile folder, assuming the drive letter for the removable media is R:.    2. Create a simple batch file called R:\Firefox.bat with the following line:  start \Firefox\firefox.exe -profile \FFProfile     3. Optionally, disable the disk cache to reduce the amounts of file writes to the removable storage by entering about:config in the address field of Firefox and set browser.cache.disk.enable to false.  The reason why a batch file is needed instead of a simple shortcut is that a shortcut uses absolute paths, and since the actual drive letter for the removable media may change depending on which computer it is plugged into, the relative path used in the batch file is guaranteed to work anywhere.

       urlLink IceWM FAQ and Howto: Installation  3.3 How to make IceWM my default window manager?  In order to run IceWM, you must assure that the executable (called icewm) is in your path. You should then add IceWM to your X start-up script (which could be .xinitrc, .xsession or .Xclients).  Note: Supplying the full path to IceWM isn't sufficient - if IceWM isn't in your path, restarting it will fail (even if you don't do this by hand it is done automatically on changing the theme).  Which of the scripts mentioned above is the right one mainly depends on whether you manually start X (using startx) or have X running all the time.  First I explain what you need to do if you manually start X. Then I address the case "X is running all the time" (which means that you log in via xdm or something like that). Finally I describe what both cases have in common. Running IceWM at X startup  If you use startx to start up X then you run your window manager from the .xinitrc file. Running IceWM after graphical login  If your system has a graphical login (X is already running while you log in) you are using a display manager such as xdm, kdm or gdm. In this case .xinitrc has no effect (it is not read in by xdm). You must instead use a .xsession file.  Hint: It is absolutely no problem to have a .xsession and a .xinitrc file (which is especially useful for inhomogeneous networks).  Mandrake users repeatedly reported that their .xsession wasn't read and no applications started. To work around that in the kdm login interface choose Default and add IceWM as the last entry to your .xsession. Besides the differences  You might have noticed that - besides being used in different cases - .xsession and .xinitrc are essentially the same. On some systems they are in fact the very same file which is called .Xclients with .xinitrc and .xsession both being symbolic links to this file.  Irrespective which start script you use (.xsession, .xinitrc or .Xclients) it must be executable. This may be achieved by issuing the following command:      chmod u+x ~/.filename  A minimalist's start-up file consists of only the command to start the window manager (in our case icewm). Most geeky people add other stuff to the file to make it look more complicated and confuse beginners >;->  Though that may be the reason for some of us, the greater majority add commands to customize X and to start some programs on login (typical example: an xterm)  The following is a (reasonable) .xinitrc file used as an example by Marko:      #-----------------------------------------------------------     # .xinitrc     #-----------------------------------------------------------      # run profile to set $PATH and other env vars correctly     . $HOME/.bash_profile      # setup background     xsetroot -solid '#056'      # setup mouse acceleration     xset m 7 2      # run initial programs     xterm &      # start icewm, and run xterm if it crashes (just to be safe)     exec icewm || exec xterm -fg red      #-----------------------------------------------------------  Note: To run IceWM, the icewm command needs to be executed. This means that all programs that are run before starting icewm either have to terminate immediately or to run in background. Also, don't exec them because that terminates execution of .xinitrc.

       urlLink Notes in Gmail - orkut - communities - messages  I know you said you didn't want to email yourself, but here are some suggestions to make it much easier:  -Create a Contact with a Name of "Notes" and an Email Address of "username+Notes@gmail.com" -Create a new Label called "Notes" -Create a Filter to add the "Notes" Label any email addressed to "username+Notes@gmail.com". Also, check the "Skip the Inbox (Archive it)" checkbox.  The effect is this: -When you email yourself from ANOTHER account, the message will automatically be archived into your "Notes" Label view, bypassing the Inbox.  -When you want to email yourself from your Gmail account, click "Compose Email", and just type "Notes" in the "To" field and hit Enter. Because you used the name "Notes" as the Contact, it will fill in automatically eliminating the need to enter a long address. When you click send, it gets sent to yourself, and auto-archived in the Notes Label.  Hope this helps! Jim: http://www.orkut.com/Profile.aspx?uid=9721409955413745991

       urlLink [freshrpms.net] - Apt  APT (Advanced Package Tool) is a dependency tool, well known to Debian users since it is used by default with their dpkg packages. But apt has been ported to work with rpm packages too, by Conectiva, who has now used it for some time in their GNU/Linux distribution. The good news is that apt for rpm may be used with any other rpm-based distribution. All you need is the tool compiled for your version of rpm and at least a repository where rpm packages and their apt metadata can be downloaded from.

Decoding and encoding is done by loading modules that are responsible  for feeding transcode with raw video/audio streams (import modules)  and encoding the frames (export modules). It supports elementary video  and audio frame transformations, including de-interlacing or fast resizing of video frames and loading of external filters. A number of modules are included to enable import of DVDs on-the-fly,  MPEG elementary (ES) or program streams (VOB), MPEG video, Digital Video (DV),  YUV4MPEG streams, NuppelVideo file format and raw or compressed (pass-through) video frames  and export modules for writing DivX;-), OpenDivX, DivX 4.xx or  uncompressed AVI files with MPEG, AC3 (pass-through) or PCM audio. Additional export modules to write single frames (PPM) or YUV4MPEG streams are available, as well as an interface import module 	  to the  avifile  library. It's modular concept is intended to provide flexibility and easy user  extensibility to include other video/audio codecs or file types.  A set of tools is included to demux (  tcdemux  ), extract (  tcextract  ) and decode 	   (  tcdecode  ) the sources  into raw video/audio streams for import, probing (  tcprobe  ) and scanning (  tcscan  ) your sources and to enable post-processing  of AVI files, fixing AVI file header information (  avifix  ), merging multiple files (  avimerge  ) or splitting  large AVI files (  avisplit  ) to fit on a CD.

       urlLink Blogger Help  This is a trick that's particularly useful on blogs with very long posts. What happens is that a reader will only see the titles of your posts at first, so they can skim through and see what they want to read. Then, when they want to read a post, they can click a link to see the full text. The text can then be hidden again when they're done reading. This all happens on one page, so there is no extra navigating to or loading of other pages.
