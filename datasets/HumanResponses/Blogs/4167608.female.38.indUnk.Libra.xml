      Notes of our return trip.  (O is 15.5 months, K is 2 months and C is nearly 13)  Somewhere over Saskatchewan I began laughing hysterically.  It was also about that time that we put O's very LAST clean, dry outfit on her and I realized that somehow we were on the last size 3 diaper in our carry-ons.  While we were so unobtrusively jetting across the prairies, both our girls were busy pooping and peeing their way through every diaper and outfit I had packed.  But I jump ahead.  Let me start at the beginning of the day's journey.  The drive to Toronto was relatively quiet and uneventful, (once I stopped crying from the sad departure at L's) leading me to continued hope that we might make the return journey as comparatively easily as the flight over.  We made good time, got the van returned and all our stuff into the airport by the two o'clock mark we'd set.  After a quick bathroom break and diaper changes for the girls, we got in line to check in our bags only to discover that the flight was basically sold out and there weren't any seats available to be blocked off for us.  Frustration and apprehension began to set in.  I had blocked the possibility of 5 hours with babies on our laps out of my mind, praying that there would be a few seats and that we would be so pitiable that we'd get them.  OH WELL.  That's why the babies get on free, right?  Because it's so traumatic for the parents that the airlines don't charge for the little monsters.  We check our bags and began walking around, looking for a spot to have some lunch and kill some time.  K is sleeping happily, O is being charming and cooperative.  We all manage to eat (though predictably, K wakes up and fusses for the duration of the meal, falling fast asleep again as soon as my plate is cleared away).  O needed a change after lunch due to food and drink spilled, but she DID learn how to drink from a straw while we were there!!!   We'd eaten near the kids' play place with slides and climbing stuff, so C went off to the bookstore and we chased O around and had her going up and down the slides and steps to try to wear her out.  She was thoroughly enjoying herself.  She played hard for well over a half an hour.  K continued to sleep peacefully, but around this point Kevin and I began to wonder if this was really such a good thing.  O soaked a pair of her shorts and had to have another change, but I wasn't too worried.  I'd packed FIVE changes of clothes for her and three for K, plus at least about 15 diapers between them.  O was beginning to show signs of impending tiredness, a good thing (one would think) as we were only about 45 minutes away from departure time.  K had woken up and eaten, also a good thing since (in theory) she would be ready to go back to sleep by the time we got on the plane.  It was around then that I acknowledged  we were soon going to have to surrender not only the stroller but K's car seat as well when we boarded the plane.   As I watched O rubbing her eyes and clinging to my knees and K starting to squirm and fuss, a sense of dread began to creep over me.  Minutes away from pre-boarding (which we OVER qualify for!) an attendant came over to us and made sure our stroller and car seat were tagged and ready to go.  We asked if they had a plastic bag we could put one of the babies in to stow under the plane as well, of course we would poke holes in it for air!  Ha ha.  Lame attempt at humour, sadly I was thinking it might not be such a bad idea.  I think it was just after this that I noticed O's diaper seemed rather squishy (again) and K started power pooping.  Ok, I was Ok.  I can change a diaper in the blink of an eye now, with the diaperee sitting, standing or laying down.  Plus, I had Kevin to help.  K chose this particular moment to turn her head and spit up most of her last meal all over the front of my shirt and down into my pocket.  Good thing I packed a change of shirt for myself.  Too bad I thought I wouldn't need it and packed it at the very bottom of my carry on.  He took O, and I took K.  Only to discover that the washrooms by the boarding gates do not have change tables!!!  Imagine!  So there I was, changing a very poopy K on a stainless steel baggage checking counter in front of about 120 folks waiting to board a long flight (with us) to Vancouver.   (At this point I still cared about what people might be thinking.  Fortunately for her, K didn't.)  And this particular change involved an entire change of clothes too, poop was halfway up her back.  I tried not to get any in her hair as I took her dirty outfit off, at the same time I hear them calling for all passengers needing assistance to begin boarding.  Uh, I am thinking that is US.  WE need assistance, no doubt about it.  Help.  Somehow we find ourselves standing at the gate ready to board, babies in our arms since neither wants to be in the stroller anymore, and we are asked to produce ID for everyone (how could we be so stupid to forget we might need to be holding that TOO) so Kevin digs around for it and then we are down the ramp and collapsing the stroller and surrendering the carseat and C and I get shuttled onto the plane while Kevin is dealing with the stroller and O.   As he collapses the stroller, a cup of juice that was forgotten about collapsed along with it and sprayed stickiness all over the stroller and the floor...  The air conditioning is not on, the plane is HOT and Kevin is signalling madly for C to come help him, which is impossible since there are already 6 other people in the aisle after us and the aisles, as you know, are only big enough for 1/7th of a normal sized person.  O is upset that her juice is gone, as well as picking up on her daddy's increasing stress.  Oh well.  The fun begins.  Or maybe it'd already started.  I lost track of it with all the fun going on.  We all get seated, the crew gets the air conditioning working and we try to get settled in.  As it turns out, against all odds, there IS a seat left and because there are only four oxygen masks per section and we have two babies, the seat in our row doesn't get assigned to anyone and we have one spare seat!  They give us K's car seat back and I am flooded with gratitude and relief.  Maybe this will be ok after all.  C has been dying to get seated and read his new books and look at his new games and I'm hoping O will fall asleep quickly and that K won't have trouble with the ascent and her ears and maybe I'll get a chance to read a few pages of my new book which looks like it might be pretty interesting if I ever get the chance to open the cover!   No delays, we are off.  Wonders never cease.  I'm wishing for a bit more cool air, but overall we are ok.  We thought ahead and bought Subway subs to bring with us for dinner since they don't serve meals on the flight.  O is getting a bit fussy from all the excitement and everything and she's tired and the only thing that will keep her calm and quiet right now is something to drink so she's been sucking back the juice and milk and already needs a new diaper.  As soon as the seatbelt lights go off I'll change her...  Which brings us to somewhere over Saskatchewan.  O has had several diaper changes, the flight is only about half over and she still won't go to sleep.  She is SO tired but can't get comfortable on our laps and every so often she just screams (very loudly, very high pitched) from sheer exhaustion and frustration.  I decide to change her again before her nap (still hopefull that she'll actually fall asleep) so I take her to the phone booth sized bathroom to do that.  While she is standing on the change table I feel wetness splashing all over my feet and legs.  O is peeing, it is splashing on the change counter and running down all over the toilet and the floor.  Although we save a diaper this way, her outfit gets soaked because it's on the counter next to her.  I mentally note that we have only one more change of clothes for her.  Three hours to go.  I get back to the seat, K wakes up (fortunately she'd gone back to sleep shortly after take off) and poops.  Kevin goes to change her.  The people on the plane must be getting tired of us going up and down the aisle every 13.5 minutes.  Or else they find it entertaining to count the times we do.  Many sympathetic smiles, not too many glares or heavy sighs.  Kevin needs a new outfit for K.  I send C back with one, (what a good kid).  I just want to sit for a minute.  I feed K, (thank goodness I am nursing her and don't have to mess around with bottles and formula) burp her, get her back in her carseat.  She seems to be ready to go back to sleep.  O on the other hand, does NOT.  She shrieks.  She yells, she cries.  She flops around, in every position imaginable, trying to get comfortable.   It was around then that I looked around at the heads and faces around me and realized that I did not care, not even one WHIT, what  anyone  on that plane thought about us.  As I listened to K grunt and begin pooping again, I start to laugh.  Hysterically. Out loud.  And the pilot tells us we are passing over Saskatchewan...  Somehow, the rest of the flight passes.  O does, eventually, fall asleep in my arms (for about an hour) after singing the I Love You song 30 times in her ear as she shrieked and flopped her way into a somewhat comfortable (for HER) position.  My butt goes to sleep, my arm does too.  Kevin paced around the plane for about an hour with K after getting her diaper changed again until she fell back to sleep.  We got in to Vancouver with one diaper left for O and no changes of clothes.  We get our luggage and picked up our van.  We drive home.  Everyone was happy to be off the plane and going home.  Having never had the opportunity to eat our subs, we are nearly starving.  We will grab some quick take out when we get home.  The subs are squashed and not very appealing sounding now.  We wonder how the animals are doing, whether our good friend M had any troubles or not.  We pull up to the house, only to see M's car in the drive.  Kevin goes in ahead to say hi and see how things are going.  As I'm unloading babies and bags he comes back out to tell me that M is on the floor in our bedroom passed out.  He thinks we should call 911...   Turns out she had sun/heat stroke.  She is fine now, after a trip to the hospital in an ambulance and about a gallon of fluid pumped into her.   And so, we are home.  Everyone survived.  Barely.
