      Mood: Reflective Listening to: Craig Armstrong - This Love  Anyone who knows me well will know how much I like Nicki. Kelly asked me today if I'd asked her out yet. I told her no. She asked me why not? I ended up explaining it to Jacs. If I asked her out she would most likely say no, in which case everything would stay the way it is now, me having a thing for her, nd her not caring. But if she did say yes, wot then? I wouldn't know what to do - having never been in a real relationship before - and I would just be a bag of nerves. I know I wont make a good boyfriend, and thats why not. I'm much better at being peoples friends.

      Mood: a little nervouse Listening to: Led Zeppelin - Dazed and Confused  Wow, I get my results of my A-levels tomorrow, or today dependin how u look at it. On the other side of sleep at least. Little nervous becose I need to do well to get into uni but I know I won't have done as well as I need to. I'm just wondering how much I have to re-sit. I went to Newcastle yesterday and met up with my friend Jacs (AKA my magical fetch twin), I havnt seen her for a while so it was real good to see her again. Got myself a ticket to see The Rasmus (also asked Nicki, Jayne nd Danielle to come) but Jayne is on holiday so hasnt replied yet, Nicki is seein if she can get the money, Danielle is askin her folks, also Kelly was gonna go with Chris nd some other ppl but asked if she could come with me instead when she found out I was goin, cos I rule! lol. I hope Nicki nd Jayne come, its been a while since I've been out with them, also we could go to Trillians after the gig nd get pissed, which will be fun :).  Also yesterday when I got home there was an email waiting for me from Abi, she seems to be having a good time dispite the storms and the new site she is at has the internet so she can email me from there, which is good. I sent her on back askin how things are goin and tellin her how things are over here. Also asked if she has found loads of goodies for her 'Folder of Shadows' (kinda like a Book of Shadows sept its in a folder). Was raining a lot today, and we had thunder &amp; lighting too, then there was a power cut, right when I was watching The Simpsons.  I talked to Rachael today, havn't spoke to her for ages, it was nice to catch up with things. Also read my friend Toms blog and there was one line that cought my attention 'ah Avril, was there ever a girl as minging as you?' I must say, Tom has SHIT taste!! Did I mention he also called Nicki vile? I think he should change opticians.

      Mood: Content Listening to: Lisa Marie Presley  Only four weeks left of the holidays. I get the results of my exams on Thursday so I'm anxious to see how I did. My mates asked me if I wanted to go out that night but I can't becasue I have my jujitsu class. We're going to see a band soon tho. My folks went on holiday today so its just my sister and me at home for the week, she is always at work tho so I pretty much have the house to myself which is cool except it means I actually have to do some housework. I was trying to learn a new guitar lick today (Damn Yankees - Piledriver) but couldnt find the tabs anywhere, so that sucked. Think I will be goin to town on monday to look for new clothes, maybe get a few college supplies and a new guitar stap.

      Man I really hate summer, its far too hot, holidays are far too long, and I get far too bored. Havnt really done anything today, I watched Shawshank Redemption earlier, amazing film. I also finished writing a bit more of my story.  Oh and I finished my personal statment for university, I'm hoping to get into Lancaster and study geography, then after that I want a job in conservation, maybe move to Canada. The woman from archery phoned me today telling me when we start, 3rd September, so im looking foward to that. Also my cousins havings a christening for her baby on 3rd October, I cant go tho cos thats the day I go to see an Avril concert in Manchester, can't fucking wait for that!!! :)

       Its like 3:40am and I cant sleep, probly something to do with me getting up at half 3 this afternoon. But anyhoo I had nothing to do so I started this 'blog', lord knows if I will still be interested in it tomorra (which is infact today) but stay tuned to find out.    Im on holiday from college at the moment, 12 weeks off with nothing to do but write stuff on here. I was at my cousins today tho playin guitar, and then I was talkin to friends online (including Nicki who I happen to have a crush on, but shhh!). My friend Abi left for France about 3 weeks ago, nd I really miss her, shes really good to talk to (although the girl has bad taste in music, terrible really). Ooo she will probably be expecting me to have wrote more of my story and songs by the time she gets back. Shit. So yeh, I'm listenin to Avril at the moment 'find yourself cos I cant find you, be yourself, who are you?' jolly good song. Its sooo bloody hot today, I with it would rain... in my bedroom. Well, im gonna go find something to do, night people.        Ooo    look   at   the    pretty    colours
