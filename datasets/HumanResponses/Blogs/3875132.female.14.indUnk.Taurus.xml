      I now present to you, our next genius: Catherine J. DiNapoli. This genius, at the age of 4, dicovered the wonders of the Platapus. She found out that there was one living in her back yard. When she was 7, she aked her parents if she coulf have the wonderous creature for a pet. And indeed they said yes. By the time she was 11, she found another one, on the side of the road on their way home from a Platapus Demo. She then found a cage at the local pet store to keep them in. It lasted 34 years, when she moved in her LA apartment, they were still alive. And here she is today. I present to you, Catherine DiNapoli.

         When I was 10 years old, I was wrapped up in so many things at one time. We had moved twice in less then a year. I remember one time, my mom and I went to the zoo. And we went into the Ape house. I remember the Ape's name: from "The Jungle Book", King Loui. I just sat there watching him, till my eyes got really watery, I was looking like I was going to cry. Then I I followed him outside onto the ropes that they climb on. And then we had to go home.

          When I was 6, I was in love with my father. I would always walk down to the corner of Isabelle Lane, and my street, it was a cul-de-sac. And I would sit there with my blankey, and wait for my Dad to come home from work. And when I saw him in his car, my eyes would widen so wide they would look like they were going to pop. And he would always bring my brother and I candy home, every day. And he would bring my mom home something special. Like flowers, or a bottle of wine. And one day, he didn't come back.
