      On my way to the city yesterday I saw a really bad car accident. The kind that you aren't really sure that everyone will live through. There were like 3 or 4 ambulances and fire trucks and so on. I didn't look for details because I would have fainted and caused another one. Well this nasty accident reminds me of how good we really have it here. Sounds stupid but... In 1998 I was in Nigeria. It was still under military rule and just to drive a few miles down the freeway you were stopped, questioned, scared shitless, and extorted for as much as they could get from you easily. They all carried machine guns you know the "I will fucking kill you " kind. I never saw anything like it. OK OK to the point. I was traveling at night from a small town called Ile Ife to Lagos. There were 6 of us in an older Mercedes, so it was a full car. As we were going we hit some traffic on the freeway, it was dead stopped actually. I could see a fire on the other side of the freeway and heard people screaming. As we got closer to the fire I could see a minivan on its side engulfed in flames. The driver of the van was dead, on fire, his body still in the position on sitting even though it was laying on the ground. I was sick with panic and then it just got worse. People that were in the van that had escaped with their lives were walking along the side of the road crying bleeding, their clothes ripped off along with some of their skin. I started crying and begging my husband to let some of them into the car. Like I said it was full really full I was on his lap in the front seat. I said lets get out and let Daddy take them to the hospital.  This was also in the middle of nowhere. The sides of the freeway were virtually jungle and there was nothing within miles and miles. Like I said before its not the safest of countries to be in to begin with and not the best place for a  lone white woman to be standing in the middle of the night along the side of the dark spooky animal infested jungle. Still I wanted to get out. I wanted those people to have my seat. I couldn't convince anyone that my idea was even close to sane. Humph. For once my whiteness was an issue. I said "where in the fuck are the ambulances goddamnit!" Well my husband being from Nigeria as well as the driver, his uncle, they were not fazed as I guess they are accustomed to watching people die HOLY FUCK SHIT MOTHERFUCK. The passengers in the back seat were 2 of our friends from El Salvador and my father in law. I was LOOSING MY SHIT, while everyone else was mildly irritated. I said give them money at least and my husband said something along the lines of "If you give a monkey a diamond he has no use for it" his ass is notorious for having some dumb ass shit to say at the most inappropriate time.  We eventually passed the accident, we passed to injured crying,DYING people, and drove off towards the next stick up station that for the first time in weeks was way way too far from where I wished they were.  That was over 6 years ago and I still feel sick at the thought of it. There are many many things that I learned on that trip but this one really makes me appreciate something I probably took for granted everyday of my life before that trip. I mean we all kinda think we have it good here but you might not really "know" how good we really do have it.

      How is it that someone so adorably cute and wonderful can actually be the casing of what I can only equate to a tasmanian devil with a severe crack addiction? Well my daughter (2) has a runny nose and woke up last night at 1am and wanted to come into my room to sleep. I am slightly retarded and thought poor baby come sleep with mama. Well lets just say that after a full night of twisty turny kicking snorkles I managed to get at best 2 hours of sleep. Damn cute genes can trick me into anything. Humph.  OK I have to say it. I am a faithful watcher of the Sopranos, I have been since the first season. OMG is all I can say after Sunday's show and watching it again last night. I mean we all knew that it would eventually happen but damn, I mean really damn. I am fully comfortable with all the shit that is done on this show but I don't think they have ever done a show that the "victim" knew that they were on there way to well the end. It was just dirty and I never thought that Christopher would be so in on it. Wow. The power of a fictional whacking. I'm still bothered by it. I love this show.  Another kind of strange thought that has been going through my mind is a recent visit to my great Aunt in San Diego who just turned 94. I took my son (18) and left my daughter with her dad, and my mom also came along. Well lets just say that at 94 she is not exactly a full blown racist but she slips up and says some funky ass shit from time to time. I know that she tries to bring her remarks down when I am around because both of my children are bi-racial and I have, well lets just say I don't have the ability to not talk shit to anyone when they get all stupid and act like ignorant asshole racist fuckwads. She informed me that the little "colored" clown on her table was given to her by a neighbor. A not really "colored" neighbor but a mixed up one. She then went on to make the watermelon comments to which the younger members of the family never heard, as in black people love watermelon, and they (the younger kids)who by the way seem to think that they ARE black but are almost clear they are so white, went on to say that's not true they like 40's and rap music. I cant believe that I actually am related to such idiots.

      Well I have been missing for a few weeks now, but am now back in action. I took a little vacation to well the looney bin. I have suffered with major depression all my life and I finally decided to go an try some different medication. Well its GREAT its better than that even. Its called Lexapro and if you haven't had some get on some, well that's if you are depressed I guess. I mean I love it, I am so fucking happy I am singing happy songs. I feel like a superhero. I am seriously thinking of changing my name to LEXAPRO! I cant ever remember being so completely content. I have taken several things over the years but woo hoo this is it. For now anyway. So I am back, I will be back reading all my favorite blogs, and starting a cult to worship the "drug". Life is good.
