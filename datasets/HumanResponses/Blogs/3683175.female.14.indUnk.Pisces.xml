       Good morning..yeah right. Last night i didn't fall asleep until 8 am. And then i got up at 11 30. God, i'm soo tired. i want to sleep. well, as interesting as i'm sure that was for everyone to read, i'll move on. unfortunatly nothing important had happened in my patheticly boring life. this is just yet another journal to put even more of my usless thoughts in! how fun for you. i'm just wasting space on here aren't i? well that's fantastic...oops and i just realized tomorrow is father's day. i'd better get a gift. i'll stop before i start to ramble :-)  ali*
