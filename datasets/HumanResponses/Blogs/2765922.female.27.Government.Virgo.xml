      I'm sure it's of no real consequence that I have not blogged for a long time, but I thought I'd jot down some thoughts anyway...  I've been battling with my ISP to reinstate my broadband service - only took 168-hours, not the promised 48-hours; I'm now over my post-holiday blues (but itching to travel to even warmer climes knowing I don't have to work!); I'm on the third draft of my supporting statement for my university application(!) and running out of time; and I'm still without gas/hot water since my boiler was decommissioned - being old and leaking - and waiting for the landlord to sort it all out! I've been celebrating birthdays of various Summer babies (excluding my own); nursing a battered and bruised knee; doing some late spring cleaning and decluttering; and beavering away at work as usual...  Other than that, not much else is happening - riveting, eh?!

       And today's highlights: none, other than the stark reality of returning home to my broadband service suspended (still), and Jacques having had the rule of the manor, not cleaning up after himself! (I really should have trained my cat to use the toilet and open the door for himself every once in a while)... &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;   I awoke feeling a little down, knowing I had so enjoyed my mini-break, but would be catching a flight home in a matter of hours. I felt this sinking I-am-going-to-miss-my-brother feeling, his hospitality and that of his kind friends, the tummy-rub-loving, singing Max, the wonderful fresh air, travelling in style and luxury, and the variety of all-around fun... Believe me, I will be returning!     &nbsp;   With my calves feeling quite sore from yesterday's snow walk, I creaked my way to the bathroom to shower, get ready, and pack. We milled about the apartment, and then popped out to buy a couple bottles of my favourite wine - one being a gift for my beau. I bid my farewells. As my brother drove me to the airport I gazed at the scenery, taking mental snapshots.     &nbsp;   Going away even only very briefly has made me realise&nbsp;I either need to move country or need to make something better of my current abode... whilst also taking advantage of frequent weekend breaks to the Continent. I'll opt for the latter, being the more realistic option and being that I don't hate England - after all She&nbsp;has treasures all Her own.     &nbsp;   Here's to living life to the fullest possible!

      And today’s highlights: Max, the singing dog and Glacier 3000 Les Diablerets...   Morning   Windows flung open, fresh gentle breeze from the Lake, enough space in my room to dance around in, feeling alive... and excited about today’s plans to venture up high – well, for me the highest I have been on foot.  Max and my brother were in the next room over, so after showering and getting ready, we met up to head downstairs for breakfast. We were greeted with an sumptuous spread – I was even able to order Green Tea and Soya milk to pour over my cinnamon squares and strawberries. A hotel able to cater to my every whim goes down well in my books!  We had to check out, leave Montreux quickly, rush back home to change into warmer gear - all in order to get to the Glacier by lunchtime and get the most out of the day. On the ride back with Max in the back of Rangie, my brother struck up a tune for Max to sing, yes sing, along to. When he’s giving it his all he throws his head back full tilt and (surprisingly) melodiously howls along to the tune of the hour – an absolutely adorable sight.   Afternoon    urlLink Glacier 3000 ! A picture is worth a thousand words, so I’ll be posting some here very shortly... For now here are few words to inadequately describe the experience: breathtaking (literally and visually), exhilarating, expansive, unforgettable, extraordinary, the list goes on...  I imagined I would have trouble breathing at 3000m. At first, the thinner air did take a bit of getting used to, but after about 15-mins I felt fine – even to the point of being able to keep a good pace and jog about 400m  after  having beer, Tomme Fleurette and Meringue with Saanen Bretzel, redcurrants, blackcurrants, gooseberries and double whipped cream at this unsuspecting restaurant cabin at Quille du Diable (unofficially called the Tooth).  On the way back from the Tooth, we hailed a ride on a Ski-Doo – wahoo! Then we caught the chair lift to the main station to head back down on the cable car with some 20 Huskies that had been up there doing a hard day’s work. Adorable pictures to come...   Evening   Come evening and we were pooped, but I still felt quite alert. After a nippy nap, we set about preparing dinner of salmon steak in filo pastry accompanied by two traditional Jamaican dishes Rice & Peas and Ackee (sans salt fish). I met another two of my brother’s friends, one of whom stayed for dinner. It was a very relaxing evening, whiling away the time with good food, good wine, good cigars and good company...  Bonne nuit and Gutenacht.

       And today's highlight: Alphorns, Le Montreux Palace and the steam room (wish I had one for a bathroom back home)...     &nbsp;    Morning      &nbsp;   The day started&nbsp;laidback, with the fresh air carrying shafts of easy morning light through the slightly open window. I did not have any difficulty getting up, knowing I did not have to go to work or sweep up cat litter dispersed throughout my flat; don't get me wrong, I love Jacques, my tuxedo clad cat - missing him and my beau now as it happens as I sit in my hotel room overlooking Lake Geneva - tough going(!) -&nbsp;but more on that later...     &nbsp;   Qu'est-ce qui se passe? The sound of Alphorns&nbsp;was being carried across the town square and through the windows. Now that's what I call a wake-up call! This prompted a visit to the market to pick up some petit déjeuner, facial wash and moisturiser... I don't think I could have come at a better time - other than when I came last year - hiking&nbsp;from the Wispile to Gsteig&nbsp;via Krinnenpass&nbsp;and celebrating Swiss National Day on the Eggli (seems to be a curious custom to put an article in front of their mountain names!).     &nbsp;   Brunch consisted of OJ for my bro and AJ for me; two kinds of croissants, normal ones for him and wholewheat topped with poppy and sesame seeds for me; bacon for him, fried eggs for me; Rice Krispies for him, on this odd occasion Sugar Puffs for me with soya milk; and Linzertorte for both of us although we were too full by this point! Oh, and I savoured a cup of Dandelion Coffee - ahhhh,&nbsp;simple pleasures in a beautiful setting! Forget a cuppa of Tetley's! After clearing up,&nbsp;I lounged out on the balcony for a while reading the International&nbsp;Edition of The Guardian. (I have a little tradition of buying only the Saturday Guardian in the UK, so I thought I could not break that tradition even if it cost 7SF!)     &nbsp;    Afternoon      &nbsp;   A couple 'phone calls later and we negotiated our stay at  urlLink Le Montreux Palace &nbsp;- this would be better than having to drive back late. The plan was for my brother to meet up with his friends, having purchased&nbsp;tickets back in April&nbsp;to see Seal in concert. Drool... if only I'd made proper plans to visit this time (as if I did last time), I'd be seeing Seal too. I'll have to settle for Seal's fourth album. Thankfully Seal's act was part of  urlLink 38th Montreux Jazz Festival , so we expected there would be other activities besides.     &nbsp;   With Max (aka Sting Ray,&nbsp;Snow Dog or the D-O-G) in the back of Rangie, we drove to Montreux, checked in, were guided to our bedrooms on&nbsp;the 6th floor, soaked up the views over Lake Geneva, and shortly after a storm moved in. If you think the weather in England is unpredictable... then hire my brother the budding meteorologist to provide an up-to-the-minute forecast for the area! I made a quick, but expensive&nbsp;phone call to my beau to tell him he should get on the next flight... Didn't happen. I settled for his affable voice instead.     &nbsp;   A few minutes later my brother was cracking a bottle of Veuve Cliquot open. We whiled away the time sipping champagne, nibbling bar snacks (threshold being 4SF in this 5* hotel!), and watching as&nbsp;dots-for-people darted for available cover.        Evening      &nbsp;   Come evening, the rain had passed so we freshened up for dinner at Paradise - a good pre-concert eatery serving a great buffet selection of mainly Mediterranean food. After dinner bro and co. took Max for a walk while I returned to the hotel to sample the spa. Bliss! I'd forgotten how much I love steam rooms especially and vowed to myself to take a tour of the various spas, steam rooms, and authentic Turkish Baths in and around London. Not being able to see my  Ecologist  through the steam, I instead made a mental note to take better care of myself. I&nbsp;felt inspired&nbsp;to commit to improving my general health and wellbeing, to savour&nbsp;grand and small, perhaps even mundane, moments. You know&nbsp;like that feeling of recently&nbsp;dusted and vacuumed decks or&nbsp;a wardrobe brimming with freshly laundered clothes. Simple pleasures. Maybe&nbsp;this&nbsp;steam is clouding my thinking... or cleansing my thinking... Mmm...   &nbsp;   With Max in bed, we met up and ventured downstairs around 10:30pm.&nbsp;As we walked through the lobby outside, we spotted&nbsp;a two-tone&nbsp;Maybach being carefully positioned by the main entrance. We had discovered earlier that Seal was staying in the same hotel as us. We lingered in the lobby waiting with bated breath to see if Seal himself would emerge... Rien&nbsp;à faire! Feeling like groupies,&nbsp;we moved on after 10-mins to   Harry's New York Bar. About this classic jazz bar, it must be said for all the public esteem it's not particularly impressive.&nbsp;Rehashing  Killing Me Softly  just doesn't cut it!       As we walked out of the bar, there was a queue to get in - curious that! Crossing the road, we went our separate ways: my brother heading towards the arena for some Seal action, me towards the&nbsp;waterfront to stroll around the array of stalls.&nbsp;I did not stay long with the crowds since most of the stalls were&nbsp;serving food, and I was still feeling rather turgid from dinner earlier!&nbsp;I simply&nbsp;decided to return to my hotel room and unwind for the day with BBC World on in the background... Bonne nuit and Gutenacht.

       This trip was very much planned at the last minute, last week in fact, to visit my brother. So unplanned was this trip that my beau could not even get the time off to come with me. However, I do hope&nbsp;we'll return more often than&nbsp;we have done in the past year for long weekends and telecommuting perhaps!  &nbsp;   Morning   &nbsp;  I&nbsp;needed to wash and dry my hair to wear it straight&nbsp;over opting for the lazy, curly look, so struggled to get up around&nbsp;3am, allowing at least 90-mins to attend to my flowing locks; the things women do for themselves, for beauty!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Two hours later I'd finished, but had intended to leave home! Thankfully, I'd packed and laid out everything the night before. Got dressed quickly, shoved the rest of my things into my luggage, and bolted out the door for the airport. Only after leaving, standing on the train station platform, did the thought flash into my mind that I'd left my passport at home! Classic faux pas - which I'd never done before. As a raced home I called a nearby minicab company  &nbsp;  6:36am arrived at Gatwick Airport, rolled up to the check-in desk with plenty of time to spare. Boarded the Jet thinking we'd leave at the scheduled time, we did not taxi for the runway for another 55-mins; still the flight arrived only 15-mins late. Not bad. Having never flown the Jet, I was expecting a similar service to the likes of BA or Swissair. Not so - you get what you pay for.  &nbsp;  My brother was waiting for me looking good in pinstripe jacket and shirt with jeans. The drive from&nbsp;Geneva Airport to Gstaad in the Rangie took just over an hour, from highway to winding mountainous routes.  &nbsp;   Afternoon   &nbsp;  Reabsorbing the splendid views and ignoring the time, we finally got around to have lunch of mozzarella burgers and salad. Around 5pm I was flagging, so took at nap. Awoke a little disoriented, clambered into the shower and put the finishing touches on my hair for the evening out...  &nbsp;   Evening   &nbsp;  The next town away is Saanen, where the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen was performing Haydn and Gruber as part of the Menuhin Festival. Other than not understanding a word of Swiss German, I enjoyed the performance - with modern flavourings of a Goldfinger or Heat original score. It did not matter much that I could not understand the seemingly comedic verbal wanderings&nbsp;of the conductor, since music is a language that can be understood, and more importantly, appreciated by all.  &nbsp;  Post-concert we went to a typically Swiss and homey restaurant in Feutersoey called Cheeserii. I was treated to Raclette and what I consider to be the finest white wine I have tasted - Aigle les Murailles.   The restaurant owner/chef and his wife kindly stayed open late and joined us for a quick drink after dinner, speaking interchangably between German and English - a challenge to my ears and reiterating the promise to myself to relearn German and French, since I have forgotten most of what I learned in school! We were ushered out around midnight.     &nbsp;   I am looking forward to a good night's sleep with the clean air breezing in... Bonne nuit&nbsp;and Gutenacht.

      Gui-dance (or God, U and I - dance) is my vision to establish a dance for development company, offering dance services in personal development (or therapy) through dance, raising awareness of and addressing primarily human and social development issues (on a global scale), and developing the art of dance.  The focus of this blog is the journey there, and much more besides...  For me, dance is not simply a form of creative expression - it's also a form of meditating, of refuelling, of connecting with my inner source, Higher Power, God, with you, people who watch and interpret dance, of being guided by something or someone, ethereal - which is hard to describe in earthly terms, but cannot be dismissed.  In an  urlLink article  Lama Surya Das states: "We're all artists; we're all dancers; we're all creative spirits in life. Dancing with life is what it's all about. Thomas Merton said: 'God prays by dancing.' Let's join in..."

       ...you suffer from high blood pressure! Really! It is highly likely at many points during the film and upon further reflection as you walk out of the cinema, you will feel enraged, blood reaching boiling point. But really -  DO  see the film. You'll only wish you had the power to impeach the president yourself... Let's just hope American citizens going to see this film in droves also turn out to the polling stations in droves to rid themselves of their homeland terror!   Albeit this film is the opinion of one man, and little is said about UK's contribution and involvement in the "coalition of the willing", but this one man's view, and passion, is utterly compelling. The next-to-no mention of the UK and Blair is probably a good indication of what the Bush Administration and the American populus think of our contribution. I hasten to add, I'm not implying our contribution and sacrifice was/is not great, but this lack of coverage is rather telling of Bush's regard for us.   Now if you don't want any further hint of what to expect during the film, don't read on... But if you need convincing you can expect compelling evidence about:     how there's no connection between WMDs and Saddam Hussein (Er, but we already knew that!)   how the Saud and Bush households are cosy (too cosy) bedfellows    how the Saudis acquired a large stake in the American economy    how the Bin Laden family were protected but the American people were not    how the Patriot Act is an insult to civil liberties and the makings of a dictatorship    how there is an ever-increasing strangehold/monopoly by Microsoft and the other MNC are playing us all, gobbling up a piece of the Iraq pie and making money off the hundreds of lost lives    how the poorest people are getting the worst deal, in terms of choices - there is only one, to go into the Armed Forces - only to end up leaving behind grieve-striken families or wind up paralysed physically and/or emotionally (and truly to add insult to injury, having their benefits docked)    how the vast majority of wealthy, privileged senators are baffled as to why they should even consider sending their own children to assist in the war effort/occupation.     One of the most unfortunate aspects of any government, and particularly in this case, is that even when America has rid herself of Bush and I predict Kerry wins, he'll have to deal with the Bush legacy and his predecessors. (And be forced to spend a lot of his presidency cleaning up the messy play room left by Bush.)

      ...And if I ever look back on it I'll probably wish I'd never written it, or think whatever I wrote is silly.  This blog is pretty much going to be a simple running commentary of sites I've come across - good, bad and indifferent - along my surfing trails. Many of the sites will be a good reflection of what I'm up to in life, and the impact, if any, that site had on me.  So let's get started...  So far today, I've come across:  The Guardian's  urlLink step-by-step starter guide  to 'blogging  The  urlLink trailer to Fahrenheit 9/11  which I'm going to see at Bluewater today with my beau  Need some tips on recording a video message from beyond the grave? The Breakfast Show crew at Virgin Radio  urlLink show you how it's done !  Reminder to self: buy the latest album from  urlLink Black Eyed Peas  - so I can play  Where is the Love  until I can't stand it anymore  More to come later...

      Yes, I'm still harping on about the next Bond - after all the producers have a very important decision to make regarding the lifeblood of the franchise.  Of course without wishing to discrimate against anyone or any group, there are a few perhaps unwritten rules for being Ian Fleming's James Bond 007. To veer from this could destroy the franchise, but more so would no longer warrant being Ian Fleming's Bond as he intended.  Regardless of today's political correctness and equal opportunities, James Bond cannot be black, gay, blonde-haired, or a woman! Does he have to be a Brit and tall-dark-and-handsome? Preferably. Encore Pierce!  OK - moving on - so who does that leave us with? Quite a few contenders actually. The current favourite amongst the producers (despite my previous blog) is  urlLink Eric Bana . And how do I know? Obviously my trusted, secret source has great insight into such matters - stay tuned...

       With the news of Pierce Brosnan's retirement from the role of 007, I am as susceptible to all the speculation as any other Bondie regarding who will garner the honour of playing Ian Fleming's James Bond 007. Orlando Bloom? Hugh Grant? Clive Owen? Jude Law? Ewan McGregor? Ralph Fiennes? And others... Can any of these men truly win our hearts?      However, may be we're all looking in the wrong place. A trusted, secret source tells me that Geoffrey Moore (Roger Moore's son for the ill-acquainted) was in recent meetings with the Bond producers, Wilson and Broccoli. About what? Well, I'll leave that to your imagination and offer this...      "The name's Moore. Geoffrey Moore." Er, I mean "...Bond. James Bond."      Roll on speculation! And roll camera for the next Bond...
