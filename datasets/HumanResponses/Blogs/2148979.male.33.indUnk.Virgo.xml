       I had to admit to a couple of my friends this week that I am broke.  It must've been because I spent over $575 on shirts, pants, dress boots, and underwear...and that is just the stuff I remember putting on my plastic THIS month.  Ok, enough is enough.  Time to stop medicating my insecurities by spending so much.  *splashes water on face*  When I get home tonight I'm going to make full use of this Microsoft Money software package I received when I bought my computer.  It's no fun looking at a low balance in my bank account.  I justified it by telling myself, hey, at least it's better than having a low sperm count.  I really couldn't help myself this month.  Once I stepped into Chinook Centre all bets were off.  There is something about the environment of that shopping mall that screams "be one of us...be beautiful...have all of these beautiful women walking the halls for yourself...be the star."  I swear to God that the mall is alive.  The entrance that I use is beside a hair salon that is full of gorgeous and well-dressed women.  I think that's one of the places where the mall spawns these women from her womb to purposefully torment me.  It was pretty bad 2 weeks ago when I stepped through the glass doors of Mexx to be greeted by this wonderful creature wearing a slim-fitting black skirt and thigh-high CFM boots.  Her blue eyes fell upon me and she didn't flinch.  I could just feel that gaze slipping the credit card out of my wallet.  Oh yeah, she knew exactly what she was doing.  We both made our way to the (clothes rack) bar and had a look at what was on the menu.  She suggested things that were quite unpalatable to me, so I had to guide her to the right places and teach her what I liked.  We both courted each other retail-style, sliding the clothes seductively over the thin changeroom door back and forth, back and forth, gingerly cradling and fondling the garments while having her talk to me when I was in nothing but my briefs and socks.  3 shirts and 1 pair of pants later, my hair is a little messy and each of us is smoking the proverbial cigarette at the sales counter with her asking if it was good for me too.  And no, I didn't call her the next morning.

       Why haven’t I updated lately?  Each time I begin a project such as this blog, Ms. Fate steps in and says “oh since you’re busy doing a load of laundry, you wouldn’t mind doing these other 2 or 3 loads too, wouldn’t you?”  That is an analogy basically stating that everything comes crashing down on your head exactly at the moment when you want or need to start doing something for yourself.  It happens to me CONSTANTLY.  “Oh, so this happens to me just NOW and not some other time” is a phrase I hear coming out of my mouth a lot.  Blame work.  And blame my supervisor.  He’s ruining your entertainment!  October and snow always ALWAYS reminds me of Wagon Wheels.  (Wagon Wheel snacks, not the wagon wheels on a cart.)  How many of you remember Wagon Wheels?  For the benefit of those who don’t know, Wagon Wheels were individually packaged cookie-like snacks.  They were maybe about four inches in diameter and half an inch thick—a sweet white layered cake with jam, all coated with chocolate.  I don’t know if they still sell them or not, but I always am reminded of them at this time of the year.  Let me explain the association…  When I was six, my family was living in Vauxhall (bonus marks for you who know where Vauxhall is) and I can distinctly remember looking forward to my first Halloween like you wouldn’t believe.  Mom got each of us kids one of those cheap mask/smock costumes that you can get at any drug store, along with a massive plastic pumpkin pail to haul around my candy.  Well, when you’re six, everything is massive.  To me, my zebra costume and pumpkin pail were nothing less than silver and gold.   I think I was more excited about Halloween than I was about Christmas.  The fateful night came and I can remember how quickly and suddenly the snow and wind appeared in the darkness.  I remember looking outside the window to see the snow and wind whipping up the fallen leaves into frigid, slushy oatmeal, and the bare, skeletal trees swaying back and forth almost struggling to free themselves from the unkempt lawns and fields.  I can remember Mom bundling us up for Trick or Treating, and I can also remember my protests over having to wear a heavy winter coat over my crinkly black and white smock.  My sisters, mother and I barely finished Trick or Treating along our street, when a huge gust of wind came up from under me and swept my zebra mask soaring over my head, across a nearby field, and into the night sky.  I was mortified.  The world came crashing down on my head (when you’re a six-year-old boy with no confidence, the world comes crashing down on your head a lot) and I bolted back towards the house screaming bloody murder to an unknown assailant, tears streaming down my frost-bitten face.  When I got home, Grandpa was busy handing out candy to visitors, so when I approached the door I composed myself (I was also very self-conscious of my appearance), wiped the tears from my eyes and slumped into a chair at the kitchen table.  On the table was a large bowl of Wagon Wheels.  I wanted to drown my disappointment in sweets, and since I didn’t get the opportunity to fill up my pumpkin, I grabbed one of the white packages and slowly and carefully opened the plastic.  The sweet cake was remarkably comforting, so much so that I briefly forgot the mask incident.  When everyone else returned, I was surprised to see my younger sister come up to me with much concern on her face, and she eagerly split the share of her candy with me.  To this day, whenever a cold Halloween rolls around, memories of Wagon Wheels and comfort come to my mind.  Ok, maybe that wasn’t quite the entertaining story I originally intended, but now I have a craving for Wagon Wheels.  Anyone have cake with jam and chocolate?

       Today my boss sent me into the concrete jungle of downtown to collect information from the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board concerning one of our bigger oil and gas clients.  Normally I would have welcomed leaving my oh-so-dreary cubicle on a mission such as this, but considering I woke up at 7:30 this morning sleepy and dazed and had to be the office by 8:00, well let's just say I wasn't too excited about going anywhere just at the moment.  I am the type of person that needs to eassssse into the day, like you slowly easssssse into a nice hot bath.  I still can remember my thoughts as I was finally absorbing the idea of leaving the office, and formulating a plan: "Lessee, hmm, here's a couple of websites of parking companies showing where their lots are located, and in relation to where the EUB office is, which is approximately half a block away...which side of the street?  Ah, ok.  Now normally it takes me 23 minutes to get back to my downtown apartment from work, so that means if I take this route from the office to the EUB, I can add on approximately 12 minutes to find a parking spot, if indeed it is multilevel and need to drive up a couple of levels, and of course factoring in the time needed to walk back down to street level....unless there is an elevator available.  But hey, what if it is one of those slow elevators?  Add on an extra 2 minutes...."  Anyways, you get the idea.  Did I mention before I obsess about things?  Nevertheless, I eventually got anxious to leave.  Now if you have ever been around engineering firms, you know that women tend to be a rare sight.  If you've *worked* in an engineering firm, and are a single man with no girlfriend, you tend to get a little itchy spending 40 hours a week with nothing to talk to or look at.  When you are that deprived, you tend to be a little more sensitive to rare opportunities as they come your way.  So here was one of those opportunities for me to have an environment with more pleasant distractions where I could relax and get the chance to flirt.  After saying that, imagine if you will: looking up from a service counter and being thrown back (not in a good way) by someone you saw.  In my case, looking at a woman, in her mid to late thirties with big BIG frizzy long hair, too much makeup, overweight, wearing: a way-too-tight thigh high red stretch miniskirt showing off large salon-tanned tree trunks, bright pumps, and a white tailored shirt busting out of its seams.  Yikes.  Where's the exit again???  Looking back, I think I may have physically been jolted when I made eye contact with her, and I think the first word that came to mind was "urgh!"  I'm sure by the reaction I had, she wasn't too happy about that.  But when I listened to her talk, (very loudly and immodestly I may add) to her young coworker, I could tell she was the type of person to just shrug it off, immediately label me as a jerk, and move on with her life without even a second look.  But really, someone should go tell her and give her some helpful advice.  Ya think?

       Ok Claire, you won.  I'm publishing my writings.  All of you can blame my outspoken best friend for the torment I'm about to put you through!  Dating in Calgary.  Ah, what better time can be spent by a single, thirtysomething, stylish, Alberta-born Asian man reflecting on dating in Calgary, other than spending that time finding yet another recipe to subject to my ridiculously expensive Calphalon cookware.  Not much, let me tell you, other than (insert blatantly sexual reference here).  Yes, if you're wondering about that "stylish" comment, I'm an attention-seeker.  And I fully admit to that.  You will find that I will admit to *many* faults and shortcomings, but you should also realize that many Calgary men would never admit their faults.  Being at peace is more important to me than being right.  I'm quite strange.  Imperfect and strange.  Even tho I seek attention, I don't trust myself enough to open up.  I'm very guarded about what I say and do.  Dare I ever make a mstake, er, mistake!  I feel displaced.  Mainly because people don't take the extra time and effort to look good.  Fashion is a lost practice in Calgary.  (As is the practice of exploiting one's own snobbiness which I seem to occasionally indulge in.)  I feel I should be living in New York or Chicago or San Francisco or (brace yourself) Toronto instead, enjoying the nightlife and culture just a little more than the average single Calgarian seems to care for.  There's another part of me that seems just so...sensitive.  That's my friend's labelling for it, not mine.  I dwell on things.  Reflect and consider.  Take things in and let my emotions have their way with them.  Dare I say I obsess?  Perhaps that is why I started this blog.  Thanks to society, it's not a man's prerogitive to "share" his feelings.  So I need anonymous outlets like this or else I would explode.  Is that why I have a tendency to be so conflicted?  Perhaps.  Courage is something I've been lacking in my twenties.  The ability to approach a woman and feel at ease (and more importantly, make *her* feel at ease) is something I've only recently gained in the past few years.   What was the factor that changed my attitude?  I cannot say for certain.  Perhaps it was constanly talking to women to get feedback, or maybe the discovery of East Indian food.  Mmm, tandoori.  Enjoy my writings.  Take what you can out of them and run like the wind...

       The clock is ticking.  I have until December 20 to find a date for the company Christmas party.  When I was still working for my old company, trying to find a date for the company Christmas party was not such a big problem.  At the old company I used to work for there were a significant number of single people, and it was not unusual to see people go “stag” or listen to people say they were not pressured to find someone to go with.  The party would usually end up with us in a large group drinking heavily and dancing the night away without a care in the world.  However this is not the case at the new company.  Everyone and their dog is either married or living common-law or dating long term.  This company has a mindset of family/significant other that you can even see in the day-to-day activities around me.  Casual talk around the office usually consists of “my wife did this” and  “my husband did that” and “my girlfriend is always saying this.”  You get the point.  At last year’s Christmas party, I was the only one out of the 100+ people without a date.  THE ONLY ONE.  I stood out like a sore thumb.  As far as I can recall, that was one of the most uncomfortable feelings I have ever had in my adult life.  Needless to say, I didn’t stay long.  Immediately after having the dinner I snuck out like a wounded dog and crashed my old company’s party where I had an immensely better time and drowned my bad experience with several gin and tonics.  I’m not sure why, but people tend to focus on events that occur at office Christmas parties.   There is a younger guy in our office, Scott, who has been working here a year longer than I have.  His first Christmas party with the company was coming up, and at the time he was not seeing anyone and didn’t have any dating prospects.  He felt so pressured to bring someone that he ended up bringing one of his guy friends along.  No, they aren’t gay—this fellow was just a close friend.  But he sure got teased about it after the party.  Even to this day they still tease him about it.  Lucky for him that he has a thick skin.  If there was anyway a man could feel as pressured as a woman who is looking for a father before she runs out of eggs, this is probably the closest he could get.  My cubicle neighbour is in the exact same predicament as me and he is also exhibiting the early stages of anxiety that I am.  We joke occasionally over our cubicle wall whether we’ve found someone yet or not, but as of yet we have no prospects.  Perhaps I should plan to schedule in an “inconvenient cold” in the likely event that nothing will turn up.

       (*Note to readers* - Cloak and Dagger will now be updated at least once every week...let's say every Thursday.  Content will depend on occurring events, of course.)  The "jumping job culture" of this profession kind of has me puzzled.  I mean, I do realize and appreciate that the availability and viability of engineering jobs in Alberta is very sensitive to the oil and gas market, but what puzzles me is why the oil and gas industry is not more interested in growing and developing its consulting and vending resources.  The consulting engineering business in Calgary has grow substantially, probably due to the hack and slash of oil company resources more than a decade ago.  Those technical resources, once under the banner of successful oil companies, now found themselves in a position where they were required to offer their services on a contractual basis.  Loyal oil and gas engineers turned to contracting in order to continue their professions.  Unfortunately, they were no longer treated as valued employees and staff.  Being a young engineer in the fray of competition of that business, I soon learned that consulting engineering is often treated by oil and gas companies (as it appears to me) in a  "use and dispose" manner, much like a piece of tissue paper.    This kind of attitude causes these EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) firms to grow and shrink--and grow again--and shrink again...well, you get the idea.  As such, the employees of EPC firms may find themselves hopping from one company to the next in an effort to continue their engineering employment in a fluctuating job market.  In addition, due to the hiring company's lack of understanding of the business, it is typically the lowest bidder winning the contract rather than the firm with the best idea, best plan, or best contract staff.  The new company I am jumping to (on Feb.9) is in an upswing cycle at the moment.  Last year's 3rd and 4th quarter financial reports of this company state that they have a backlog of work, which is not unusual for medium-sized firms at the present time.  Engineering firms around the city, such as the one I'm joining, are scrambling to find seasoned engineers.  (Sidenote: the firm I am leaving is relatively busy, but it has misallocated its staffing resources due to poor business development and planning.  They were not interested in developing their resources such as in process or facilities engineering.  In my opinion, their business strategies need to be changed, and the senior and executive staff must work harder and be more innovative in order to get the business they spoke of targetting a year ago.  They are too complacent, and the staff hiring is experiencing much more nepotism and favouritism.  Don't get me wrong, there are good people, but the overall feel of the company is reflected in one employee's comments to me when I first started: "(This company) is a good place to retire.")  The oil and gas companies have shot themselves in the foot.  With a booming market, they now find themselves in a position of needing experienced consulting services.  What they didn't count on was that a big chunk of the workforce they laid off more than a decade ago (the workforce who today would be senior engineers) have left for greener pastures, either leaving the country for more stable and profitable work, or leaving the profession entirely to pursue a career where they would be treated more fairly.  As such, oil and gas consulting firms are loaded with younger, inexperienced engineers trying to cope with the busy schedules put on them by needy clients.  As a younger engineer I suppose I should see this as a good thing, but speaking as a professional trying to gain experience and knowledge (which is both a personal goal, as well as a requirement of our professional associations), I'm finding it painfully frustrating.  The senior engineers I have worked under are overworked and overloaded, and trying to get their mentoring and advice on a regular basis is almost impossible.  They don't have time to mentor, and they don't want to.  To complicate matters, consulting firms typically have meager budgets dedicated to continuing education, maybe in order to increase profit margins.  And of course like all companies in all industries, consulting firms are expected to do more with less resources.  Now as I join the ranks of intermediate engineers who are always looking for the angle, demanding high wages and company benefits, and always in search of companies that have enough work and treat us fairly, I reflect on my colleagues.  This is the prevalent attitude of intermediate and senior engineers.  Loyalty was not given to us, so we do not return loyalty.  Everyone is out for himself/herself.  And I find that very sad.

       It's funny how Erwin and I were just discussing last week about dating age.  Today I ran across a couple of articles on the Calgary Herald website concerning age-based attitudes of couplehood:    urlLink Love and marriage isn't for the faint of heart      urlLink Singles delaying marriage longer    (Due to canada.com's constant cleaning out of their website, these articles may not appear if you try to access them at a significantly later date than this blog entry...)  Does this mean twentysomethings have a bad attitude towards the institution of marriage?  Perhaps, perhaps not.  It's hard to say from these articles.  The general sense I got was that twentysomethings tend to avoid marriage out of fear: fear that marriages tend to end in bitter divorces, fear of losing one's independence and identity, fear of settling for someone who does not live up to his or her personal expectations.  Frankly that does not surprise me.  The media peppers the public with divorce stories and statistics.  At the same time, there is a growing tendency for young people to assume that they will have (or deserve) an equivalent or increased standard of living that their parents had when they were growing up, so they would tend to demand more personal dividends from a relationship.   In addition, today's North American culture has contributed to a short-sighted, disposable attitude amongst youth, so the patience, commitment and effort that is required in a serious relationship would be undermined.  Also, considering the much-published 50% divorce rate, it is reasonable to assume that twentysomethings probably have personal experience stemming from their own parents' divorce, or at least know of the fallout stemming from a divorce in their circle of family or friends.  One thing that confuses me though is: if statistics report that lowered marriage rates are being driven from more and more women becoming financially independent, then why does one of these local stories report of women who live with their families?  It doesn't specify.  Is this due to financial hardship (which would contradict the female financial independence statement) or is this due to other factors, like female social requirements and emotional support?  And in this story, what about the men still living with their parents; men, generally speaking, tend to have higher incomes and tend not to require the emotional/social infrastructure as much as women do.  So what is the twentysomething male motivation for still living with his parents?  Contrary to Westman's reports in the second article, I whole-heartedly believe young men and women *can* afford the toys without living at home if they are willing to put forth the effort into their personal finances and learn to deal with financial choices.  For me, this complicated the message of the article, and perhaps suggested another factor into young people staying at home--their parents allow it.  As such, parents allow their children to not have clear goals in relationships.  I can understand why the thirtysomething coffee shop owner is baffled by his twentysomething clientele.  With older people, it seems, there is a clear goal to reach in couplehood.  With twentysomethings there is no goal; rather, there is a personal indulgence and unwillingness to give and contribute to a sustained, committed relationship.  Perhaps I should take this into consideration when I want to take dating to the next, more serious, level with the woman I will meet in the future.  But should I really give up the twentysomething woman who is genuinely interested in me for a thirtysomething woman who wouldn't give me the time of day?  Couplehood is wayyyy too complicated!

       Ok, ok, I know the link didn't appear as an actual *link.*  My brain wasn't in HTML mode at the time.   urlLink Hella Trump!   Ahhh, ok that's better.  Forgot to add the text afterwards.  Hulk not smash!  So how was your weekend?  For me, I just spent the weekend full of reflection.   Claire was feeling blue, but I successfully cheered her up.  So much so that she invited me to her place to watch a   urlLink movie.   Claire didn't care too much for the flick, but I really liked it.  I always like to watch well-written quirky movies, and this was one of the quirkier ones.  I enjoyed almost all of it until I realized that Milla Jovovich's character eerily reminded me of my ex, Marni.  Especially when she was riding the heck out of the young, naive banker on the bed.  (me = young, naive humped victim)  On Sunday I went to Chapters to look for resources on buying a condo and general negotiating.  I avoided the customer dredge (eg. teens and baby carriages, or scarier yet--teens *with* baby carriages) that permeates Chinook Centre, and kept on driving down to the Chapters beside Schanks near Southport Road.  The cliente here tends to be: a) calmer and quieter, which keeps the atmosphere stable, and b) older, which means it's not full of annoying teenagers skipping class.  I've noticed that most people that go to that Chapters are around my age.  It's very pleasant to spend my Sunday afternoon wandering the wide aisles with my soy caramel macchiato.  (Speaking of books, one of my previous bosses wrote a  urlLink Canadian bestseller.   If you work on commission, this book is definitely for you.)  Sure the store is bigger, has more selection, feels uncrowded and calm, and truthfully, I've noticed that more attractive adult female customers wander this store than the Chinook Centre store!  I just have to be careful that they don't catch me reading material on abnormal psychology or S&M...  Just to give you your fill of links for today, here's something distracting that I ran across...   urlLink Wil Wheaton Dot Net   Wesley saves the universe, er, blog universe, again!

       Happy New Year!  Hey, here's a great resolution idea: get back to blogging!  So here I am again.  I hope your holiday was good.  For me, my holiday gave me the opportunity to relax and reflect on things I want to accomplish for this year, and being at my mom's place and rocking back and forth in that big brown reclining chair she has really helped shake the cobwebs from my head.  Here's my list:  1. Dating, duh, of course will be big on my agenda.  2. Try out a yoga class.  I've already signed up at a studio and my first class is tonight.  3. Buy a condo.  That will probably be late summer/early fall if things go right.  4. Travel.  I just realized I haven't been out of the country in over 3 years.  5. Play my guitars.  Too much dust has gathered on them.  Point #1 came into the spotlight just last night when I was on the phone with Epo.  He was telling me of his unsuccessful setup during the holidays.  While deep down inside I don't believe in setups (sorry Epo, I'm really not a matchmaker...you'll have to look elsewhere), I do believe it can be used as a tool to meet someone of the opposite sex.  The person setting you up can do a background check of the person in question, and if the other person likes what he/she hears, then away you go.  Like I said, it's a tool.  But it is only one of MANY tools you can use.  Ooo, I feel a good rant coming on....  Lately I've had people, including coworkers, ask me in one form or another on how I meet women.  Now I've been doing the singles thing quite actively in the last couple of years and have talked to MANY people about this, and the biggest mistake I see people make is that they get stuck using the same tool or tools over and over and over again without success.  Then they complain that it isn't working for them.  Well here's some advice--if it isn't working, DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT!!!  Think outside the box!  If you aren't attracting the ones you are interested in, then change yourself, your attitude and your strategy, or else if there isn't anyone you're interested in then change your environment and your activities.  USE DIFFERENT TOOLS.  This is such a challenge for people to do.  The first thing that comes out of the mouth of the person I suggest this to is: "But I don't like doing that" or "but how am I supposed to do that" or "but I don't know where to go" or "but there isn't anyone there I like" yadda yadda yadda.  To me, these are just excuses covering up the fear a person has of rejection.  The only thing more irritating than a "BUT" is running out of toilet paper after you've taken a big dump.  Get rid of the "but" and haul your BUTT instead!  Here is a list of ideas...  1. Get educated.  Join singles groups and talk to other singles about things they've done in the past or events they've attended.  Read local publications like Avenue magazine or Calgary magazine because I've seen several articles and advertisements on singles activities.  2. Get contacts.  If you're not venturing outside your protected group of friends and coworkers, you are less to meet any new prospects.  3. Get skills.  Date date date.  Then date some more.  Even if it's not someone you're really attracted to, go on a date.  Because the more you practise your conversational skills, the more you'll find out about the opposite sex and the more marketable you will be later down the road.  The more you date, the longer you'll keep these conversational skills.  And who knows, that person you thought you didn't like might turn out to be someone who will actually create sparks.  4. Get diversified.  Don't rely on just setups or just internet dating or just a single activity.  Try different things.  Go to different events.  Go to different places than you usually would.  5. Get friendly.  Talk.  Talk to people in the checkout counter at the grocery store.  Try going to a different grocery store now and again and talk to the people there.  Talk to the coffee server at Starbucks.  Talk to the person browsing the same section in Chapters as you are.  Talk to the people in your evening class or sports club.  And don't forget to smile!  (That smiling thing was Claire's advice she gave to me one day.)  You never know if the person might fancy you and invite you to his/her weekend party where you could meet even more people...  6. Get positive.  No one likes a negative ninny.  7. Get involved...in yourself.  When you do things for yourself, you feel better about yourself and won't worry so much about dating.  8. (This one is directed to Joe at work....)  Get off Brian's back, I ain't your pimp!  *Whew!*  Good rant.  Good thing I got that off my chest.  Now I can get back to work....  Have a chingy day!

       "For Best Driver on a Highway in a Zero-Visibility Snowstorm, the nominees are..."  While most of you were curled up under blankets on the sofa watching the Academy Awards on Sunday night, I was fighting for my life.  I left Canmore (from visiting my cousin and her family) to head back to Calgary at about 10pm, and no sooner than I drove 2km outside the city limits than *BOOM*, I hit a sudden and massive snowstorm that threatened to do something nasty to me while I was flying down the highway.  The roads turned from a comforting black to a thick rutty blanket of white, and the sheets of flakes kept me from seeing anything beyond 30 feet in front of me.  At times I was forced to slow down to about 50 km/hr and relied only on the small reflective posts along the side of the road to guide my way through the chaos.  *Thank God for divided highways!!!*  If the oncoming traffic had not been on a separate road, I'd probably be writing this journal entry from a hospital right now.  I joined the long lineup of vehicles that were also caught in the squall, and I didn't even have to look through their windows to know that each one of the drivers was wondering if they would make it back to town without getting into a serious accident or worse.  I didn't want to even think any further about that, so I turned up the stereo as loud as I could to drown out any negative thoughts.  I just wanted to get home in one piece.  I unconsciously gripped the steering wheel as hard as I could for about 45 minutes until we hit the tree line, and as suddenly as it came, the storm vanished and the roads and fields were bare.  The only evidence of the storm was on my heroic Neon, and I could see the chunks of crusty snow drop off the sides onto the incredibly welcome and bone dry asphalt.  I let out a triumphant cheer and clenched my very sore hand into a fist of victory which probably surprised the driver next to me, but I didn't care.  Never before was I so happy to see the wide band of Calgary city lights on the horizon.

       Phones...  I was a little hesitant to write about this until now since it is rather dark and kind of hits close to home, but I think many of us encounter these twists and turns in life and I can't help but mention it here....  Last week I got a call out of the blue from a former engineering classmate, "Mindy."  Mindy and I haven't spoken since we graduated university almost 7 years ago, but the upbeat personality and friendliness I heard on the phone was certainly not forgotten.  We briefly took time to catch up on each other's lives and reminisced about old classmates.  But she revealed to me that the topic of old classmates was the real reason she was calling me.  She was trying to reach other members of our graduating class to relay news.  Two of our classmates had hooked up and gotten married after graduation.  We never became friends, but I knew that they were a great couple--both were shy, unassuming and soft-spoken, and each carried around a quiet intelligence that you could see in their eyes.  They looked great together...they were one of those couples that made you think that a higher power actually designed them to live the rest of their lives together.  I didn't know them well, but I knew enough to see they belonged together.  Mindy revealed to me that on the previous weekend, they were travelling on an icy stretch of highway from Bonnyville to Edmonton.  There had been a freak snowstorm and the road was treacherous.  So treacherous in fact that they lost control of their vehicle and had a horrific accident.  The wife lost her life, and the husband at the time was in serious condition at an Edmonton hospital.  Why do bad things happen to good people?  This is one question that life does not have an answer for.

       What are you currently watching on the tele?  Here's a list of shows that I seem to be watching on a regular basis:  Survivor All Stars The Apprentice Dr. Phil (of course) M*A*S*H reruns Coronation Street (I obviously get bored on Sunday mornings) Occasional WWE: Raw or Smackdown Occasional American Idol  On TLC:  What Not to Wear ( urlLink Stacy London  may be a prudish drama queen, but she fascinates me...!) Junkyard Mega Wars Date Patrol  On Life Network:  Matchmaker Bar Life  On Space Channel:  Star Trek original series Star Trek: TNG Robot Wars Electric Playground The occasional sci fi movie The occasional WB Channel movie that I missed in theatres years ago  Any cooking shows on The Food Network, including Emeril.  Any news that does not cover American or Canadian politics (if I can help it).  Bits and pieces of Spike TV such as Most Extreme Elimination Challenge, or Sports Illustrated 40th Anniversary Swimsuit show--yummy.  Mind you, other than The Apprentice and Survivor, I only watch a few of these each week when I am not in the gym or running around doing errands, or making a fool of myself trying to get a girl's attention.

       Clothes Shopping is my Drug of Choice  Ah spring, time for a young man's thoughts to turn to--throwing out those ill-fitting, worn out shirts and pants!  Arriving home one Friday evening, I was in a particularily dreary mood after spending an extra hour in the office and realized that I needed to catch up on even drearier household chores.  One load of laundry later and I found myself peering into my closet contemplating on how dark, and I mean dark, the colours of my shirts were.  Totally unacceptable for spring!  I wanted to make this year's clothing transition much more smoothly than previous years, so I did a little bit of research.  After a brief Internet seach, I discovered that websites  urlLink like this one  can be amazingly helpful for ideas.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Harry Rosen or Henry Singer by any stretch of the imagination, but thanks to heavy doses of  urlLink TLC's show What Not to Wear , I had a bit of a brain fart and realized that perhaps I should be a little more conscious of what is appropriate to wear.  I decided to do something about it, so I killed the Saturday afternoon by making trips to Chinook Centre, TD Square and Banker's Hall to see what could be done to remedy my haute couture (or lack thereof) predicament.  From the inital scans of store layouts, it appeared that the common themes were pastel tops, solids and light patterns, layering, and light-coloured neutral pants in beige, tan, or grey.  About $400 later, the closet is looking much better.  Ok ok, I know that What Not to Wear is hosted by a drama queen and a no-way-you-can-miss-it gay man.  But I bit the bullet, looked beyond their rhetoric, and found out what the show is really about: realizing what is appropriate according to the occasion, taking some pride in yourself, and demonstrating a little more confidence and self-respect in front of others.  So there.  *thpppt*  Next week will be shoe rescue week and going on a quest for a blue blazer.  My black boots are toast, but perhaps that will be for the best as they are too hot for spring/summer anyways.  I should rather be considering  urlLink these  for the office or any hot dates that may come my way.  Ok, maybe the hot dates aren't so plentiful right now, but at least I'll look good trying to get one.

       While I was getting lunch in the kitchen just now, the general manager told me that there is a good possibility that this company may pick up and move downtown.  He said we may know as early as April.  Hrmph!  Hopefully those talks won't be delayed.  Such a decision will definitely affect where I purchase my new home this year!!

       Last Night's Dream  It was the middle of the day in the spring or summer and I was walking downtown trying to get home, but everywhere I turned there was some sort of road construction or building construction or building demolition.  Very noisy and dangerous-looking, and I think chunks of building kept falling around me.  It was a Sunday so there was no traffic to deal with.  I remember talking to myself and saying all of this construction would cause headaches for commuters on Monday.  I had to walk an extra 4 or so blocks to get around everything.  I wasn't too happy about that.  I managed to get around all of the construction and demolition, but soon I found myself inside one of the office buildings, in a conference room or ballroom, a few floors up looking at the street below.  Some sort of parade was going on and I saw all of these neat and shiny vintage cars in bright colours lined up on the street.  Each one had a platform deployed on the passenger side, holding what looked to be a kayak.  "For sport-minded enthusiasts," I remembered saying to myself.  At the time I was enthused about the idea.  I turned to walk away from the window, and as I was passing the crowd I was surprised to see Christopher Walken standing behind me.  He was dressed like he was in the Fatboy Slim - Weapon of Choice music video, and had a similar expression of disinterest like he did at the beginning of the video.  He didn't notice me, but as I walked right past him, I looked at him from behind and saw that he was wearing a silver ear stud, high up on his left ear.  Then the dream ended.

       Job goes WHEEE, date goes SPLAT  3 days into the new job at the new engineering office and things are looking up.  Ran into a handful of people I used to work with at one of my old jobs (that's 2 jobs back, if you're keeping track), so it was refreshing to see some familiar faces.  They put me in an office on the 7th floor that faces north, and since I'm 50-some blocks from the downtown core you can see the downtown skyline very clearly.  Looks like a postcard.  Unfortunately the previous tenant was an absolute slob so I had to put quite a bit of effort into cleaning the desk, tables and bookshelf....and I think I picked up some bent paper clips, used staples and petrified M&Ms scattered on the floor.   The cleaning staff conveniently ignored my note of concerns I left for them, so I had no choice but to take matters into my own hands.  So much for an office welcome.  Welcome shmelcome, just clean up my friggin' office, thank you very much!  After rearranging the (heavy and archaic) furniture to my liking and wiping off the dried up splashed coffee (I think it was coffee) and numerous old scuff marks off of the walls, I unloaded my library and collapsed behind my desk, relishing the P4 1.8GHz/256MB RAM desktop they assigned to me.  Full high-speed Internet service that runs as smooth as a baby's bottom.  They didn't cheap out like my old company did (Win NT 4.0 with administration and website lockouts on an old Celeron machine shoved into a cubicle....bleah) thankfully.  Now if smoothing out the dating barriers was as easy as smoothing out a workplace envirnoment, then I wouldn't be pulling out my hair as much.  D. told me that her phone wasn't working or might have been off the hook when I called her place on Saturday afternoon.  So is that why the voicemail kept kicking in over the 3 times (over the hour and a half) I tried calling???  As Epo would say: Frig.  As you can imagine, all sorts of disasterous hypothetical situations were creeping into my head.  In the evening she did return my messages and sounded a little upset about the situation, and was apprehensive because she thought I might be angry with her.  Of course I had to say it was ok (even though it wasn't--I was pretending not to be upset) as I attempted to reassure her.  I successfully hid my disappointment, and we talked for an hour.  Tried calling her last night, but she did not answer.  She lives with her mother, yet her mother didn't answer either.  Or else they both were home, and D. saw my name on call display and told her mother not to answer it.  Oh don't sit there and tell me that wouldn't happen!  Women are infamous for doing such things to men.  I'm not ruling out the possibility that I'm a schmuck in her eyes, but neither am I ruling out that she just possibly, REMOTELY, may have some sliver of attraction to me.  Why must I always go through these exams before being able to relax and really be myself??  I see women with bad hair and cheap clothes walking past my door, so I guess that's the sign I should get back to work....

       Bah, 3 days left working here, I guess I can afford to slack off a bit and do some more blogging...  Do you ever have personalized rules that you live by?  I'm not talking about stuff like "Thou shall not steal," or any other cliched, overworked phrases, but rather rules that apply only to you?  One of my own rules that I learned from Dad was:  "What I don't have, I create."  My father was a very resourceful and innovative man.  He was very hands-on and learned by doing.  Dad was very tenacious and tackled household problems head-on with no doubts or hesitation.  If he didn't know how to do something (like repairing the lawn mower or a minor car problem), he would roll up his sleeves and start poking and prodding to see how things worked.  If there were supplies he required, he would immediately make a trip to Canadian Tire or Wal-Mart to see what was available and create a supply of resources.  If there was a tool or structure he needed but wasn't readily available, he would look around the house and make something that would help with his task.  This was a trait I really admired in him, and I tried to adapt his philosophy.  Over the past couple of months it seems like I have forgotten that rule.  In this case, my dating life has gone partially down the toilet because I have not created what I needed for a successful date.  Looking back, I can remember that the most successful dates I have ever had were ones where I planned and created an atmosphere of spirit, fun, happiness and success.  I can recall that the most successful dates I have had were ones where I left my doubts and hesitation at home and jumped in with both feet.  I tried to create a positive attitude and have an open mind and not be self-conscious or be overly critical of my date or myself.  Luckily I had a flash of insight last night, and I snapped out of the slump and phoned up a girl whom I was mildly interested in, but with which I have been having doubts about.  I decided that if I was to stay in the game, all (reasonable) doubts would have to be set aside because sitting home doing chores and watching uninteresting TV shows all weekend is not acceptable to me.  Making that choice did wonders for the outcome--the positivity came out, there was no hesitation nor awkward silences in my conversation, and as such I now have a date on Saturday afternoon!  I will have to make sure this rule stays on the list from now on.

       This was a great story I wrote to my sister.  I had to reprint it here:   As some of you know, over the past couple of months I've been having lots of problems with the young, insensitive twentysomething neighbours downstairs, a guy and his girlfriend.  They play their music really loud, turn up the TV very loud, and even talk very loud (especially the girlfriend) and like to party and have their friends visit way past midnight on weekdays.  Both myself and the building manager have spoken to them on separate occasions to no avail, and I've even purposefully beaten on my floor/their ceiling *extremely loudly* to get the message across.  One night when they were blaring the stereo, I decided I needed to calm down and so took a hot bath with the door closed to at least muffle the din and chill out.  As I was lying there, I thought "this is it, I'm totally done, I can't take this anymore."  As I was lying there in the tub, I started talking to Dad (who passed away last summer) about my problem.  Then I asked Dad if he could do something because I couldn't think of anything else.  2 days later, they moved out!  Why, I don't know for sure.  I suspect it was either that the building manager also got fed up, or they couldn't pay their rent cheque (which, after talking with the building manager, is a surprisingly common thing) but I am convinced Dad had something to do with it.  Thanks Dad!

       Here's something I needed to work on at the office today:  "Calculate the circulation rate of 98.7 wt% lean TEG needed to dry 1,000,000 std m3/d of natural gas at 7.0 MPa and 40C in a six tray absorber (1.5 theoretical trays) to achieve an exit gas water content of 117 kg per 1,000,000 std m3.  The inlet water content is 1100 kg per 1,000,000 std m3 of saturated gas."  Ummmm....  I think I just wet my pants.

       Spring Has Sprung, the Grass is Riz--I Wonder Where My Mojo Is...  You would think that the recent spring weather would bring around thoughts of rolling around in the hay with a cute blond.  But the exact opposite has happened.  I've put women on the backburner and have made the decision to stop dating.  The last couple of misunderstandings I had with women totally infuriated me.  They made me feel like I was a doormat.  The familiarity of resentment has come back to haunt me after a long hiatus.  This resentment had been building over the past year, and the recent incident was the last straw, so I made a choice not to put myself in a position where I would be vulnerable and prone to be taken for granted again.  I guess when you honestly make the attempt to show someone that you care and are interested, to show that you are willing to put yourself out there, to give your time to invest, to get into the game with eyes and heart wide open with a willing spirit and positive attitude, it's just not enough.  You're not good enough unless you fit the specific image they have in their minds, and even when you make the effort to change yourself to fit the image, this is still not good enough to be considered as a possibility or even a viable and worthy alternative.  If I were to continue down the dating road, the meager choices that seem to be offered to me are: 1) to swallow my pride and go back into a relationship where my life and beliefs are yet again to be made insignificant and worthless, 2) to continue to fool myself into thinking that my spirited attempts to catch the attention of a woman of quality will result in something other than the constant rejection I have been receiving, or 3) to not be in a relationship at all.  So I choose to save myself by making the third choice.  This is actually a weight off my shoulders.  I have other things I need to be focusing on at the moment, such as reinvesting in my creativity, establishing family connections, buying a home and nailing down my finances.  I don't need to be thinking about women, which really is an effort that wastes my time, my money, and erodes my spirit and ego; honestly, there really is nothing I get in return in the long run other than a smaller bank account and hurt feelings.  Time to buckle down and focus on things that make a real difference in my life.

       All That You Can't Leave Behind  Last night I had the opportunity to attend a buyout party for a couple of ex-coworkers.  The turnout was very large and consisted of people still working for the company as well as people who had moved on to different employers.  Some had jumped to the company that I am currently working for, some had jumped to 2 different competitors, and the rest remained to tough it out with the same company.  The camraderie was very evident and everyone had a great time.  Everyone that showed up was a familiar and welcome face, and I experienced a feeling of missing out on a good group of people.  This is the 2nd time this week (along with several other times this year) I have felt like I have missed something good after having set it aside, leaving it or ignoring it.  The 1st time was when I started unintentionally browsing around snowboards, and wondering why I haven't hit the hills this season.  I haven't taken any interest at all this year.  I've been telling myself over and over that my broken binding was keeping me from going.  (Weak excuse!)  But looking at those snowboards and hearing my friends talking about making trips to the mountains helped sparked the interest that I thought had died in me, so yesterday I took advantage of the season-end equipment sales and finally got a new set of bindings.  And today I actually am excited about the thought of zipping down the slopes again.  I guess I'm writing this because I rarely ever notice myself saying "I miss this" or "I miss that."  But I'm noticing it now.  So what's the reason for telling myself this?  Maybe I'm a little dissatisfied with my life at the moment.  There doesn't seem to be anything that excites me right now.  Even despite the new job I started a month ago.  I recently found myself asking for anything, even a little bit of drama, to happen around me.  My younger sister told me that this is a "blah" time that everyone experiences during the year because everyone is so fed up with winter.  I don't know if that's true for me.  I just seem a lot more concerned that usual.  I've been pretty good at keeping tight-lipped to avoid my usual negative banter so as to save my friends and family from the deluge of bad vibes, but right now I'm feeling more stagnant than ever.  I experience this downer every year, but never have I experienced missing out on things from the past.  I just had a thought.  Maybe it's because I noticed that my Dad's birthday is coming up on the 26th of this month and he isn't here to celebrate it.  Actually the more I think about this, the more I'm realizing that this is probably the reason.  Maybe I'm getting the itch to capture old positive feelings about things because of my Dad's death.  It would probably be a good idea to stew about this for a while and think more about how my Dad's death has affected me.

       A Short Letter to Ross  Dear Ross,  I missed saying goodbye to you.  I'm sorry about that.  This sounds like a lame excuse but they didn't tell me that you had left because of a miscommunication, but I'm angry only at myself for that.  Well, to be honest, I've got several negative feelings directed at myself for other things too.  I'm disappointed in myself that I didn't keep in contact with you over the last couple of years.  I'm disappointed in myself that you and I didn't get a chance to go skiing or take a few swings at the driving range.  I'm upset that I didn't take the time to get to know you more behind the scenes, so to speak.  I mean, you told me a little bit about your wife and just highlights of your family trips to B.C. and of course the crazy things that went on back at the office.  But I remember the talks we had while we were working on our projects and then I realize that you and I knew already that the office was falling apart, heh!  It feels weird to be pushing forward with my life when I am thinking that you are gone, and also thinking about how you had to stop and deal with illness in your life.  They say bad things happen to good people, and I really question why that is, especially since I just had bad news about my former classmates.  But as you said to me, sometimes you just have to stop and re-evaluate the things that are really important in life and deal with stuff one thing at a time.  Then life becomes a little more clear.  I have to be content with the idea that you are in a better place now, although I can't help but feel that your time was cut way too short.  I'm not going to get upset right now--I know you like to keep things controlled and private, but I think you have to give me and the others in your life the opportunity to reflect on the impact that you had on this world and the lives you have touched.  I'm sure we'll be crossing paths again in the future.  After all, the EPC biz is a small world, right? ;-)  God speed, Brian

       The First Steps  I am getting pumped.  The mortgage pre-approval is now in my hands (whoaaa money!) and the search for a new townhouse condo has gone into full swing.  I had a lunch meeting with my real estate agent on Monday to see if he would be a good fit with my detail-oriented personality, and he passed with flying colours.  It is very rare to find a buying agent who actually specializes in condos since most agents are driven by the higher dollar figure detached housing market, but I lucked out and found Gerald.  Gerald is the president of a local condo association, member of the Canadian Condo Institute, and has written many articles on condo purchasing for Calgary Real Estate News and the Calgary Herald.  Try finding this kind of reputable resume detail on your everyday run-of-the-mill real estate agent--not likely!  As you can see, I do my homework.  I put together lists for him to take home of: things I need, things I don't really need but would be nice, things I definitely DON'T want, and a list of areas in Calgary that looked good.  Gerald looked surprised then appeared pleased when I gave him a copy of this info.  Perhaps it's because he's used to dealing with people who aren't so organized!  We have scheduled a west-side trip on Sunday afternoon to see half a dozen or so townhouses.

       God, please forgive me for what I am about to do...  For some time now the neighbours upstairs have caused me much stress.  Their constant noise has really affected me.  I've got anxiety that I deal with each day and I worry so much about the next day's noise that I don't feel like I'm getting a full night's sleep.  I complained a lot about them to my friends.  I have also contributed to the complaints of other tenants about this couple that the building manager has heard, and the frequency of complaints reached such a point that on Tuesday they were given their eviction notice.  Despite my concerns, I really don't think this is the right course of action.  I never wanted them to be evicted, I just wanted some quiet!  Why didn't he get all of us together to talk about the problems BEFORE doing such a thing?  I think the building manager is making a mistake by trying to evict them right now.  They have until June 30 to move out.  The couple has decided to fight the manager and take this to court.  I've been asked by my building manager to write a letter explaining the details of my problem.  I am very hesitant to do such a thing because this specific and carefully worded letter could possibly put the nails in the coffin for the couple.  The letter reads...  "The intention of this letter is to outline the noise concerns that I have in regards the couple (XX and XY) living above me in Suite 11.  The specific things I have encountered since they moved in are:  1. Consistent and very audible arguing and use of profanity between themselves  2. Disruptive and uncomfortably loud creaking emanating from their living room couch resulting from their frequent sexual encounters  3. Loud pounding on my ceiling resulting from:  a) walking inconsiderately across their floor  b) occasional jumping and occasional chasing of each other  4. Consistent disregard for the levels of sound on their TV and stereo  Individually the sounds do not last long.  However the sounds do occur consecutively and as such the accumulation of these incidents makes it upsetting and stressful to live in my apartment, particularly the pounding.  It should be noted:  I had approached XX one time a couple of weeks ago to explain specifically how disruptive and upsetting the loud ceiling pounding was to me.  After this talk, on the evening of Thursday, June 3, XX came to my apartment to apologize for the loud pounding, and I appreciated this gesture very much.  XX also explained that her family was going to be visiting her that same evening to watch Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Playoffs on television.  XX said that her family, especially her brother, would be rather excited about the game and warned me that I would be experiencing noise on that particular evening.  As I felt she was being sincere, I accepted her apology and accepted the fact that it would be noisy that specific evening and told her to go and enjoy the game.  At this time I also explained to her that we all needed to be considerate of each other and all needed to respect the noise “rule.”  Also it should be noted that the level of sound from their TV and stereo (Item 4 above) has recently and noticeably gone down and such is no longer disruptive to me.  However, the accumulation of noise is still at an uncomfortable level for me personally and has made me decide to start looking for a new home at this time.  I do intend on purchasing a townhouse so the process may take one or two months to fully complete.  Once I secure these details, I will give you another notice thirty days prior to the date of my intentional move.  Let me make it clear that I do not harbour any malice or anger towards the couple, nor do I believe that either of them do this intentionally to spite me, but I do believe that this decision would satisfy my need for a quiet and comfortable place to live.  It is obvious that their normal day-to-day activities at home are incompatible with my particular noise tolerance.  Perhaps it would be best if you found another tenant with a higher tolerance.  If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know."  Hmm.

       'Successful Relationship': an Oxymoron?  I'm puzzled.  No, I mean absolutely baffled.  The things about relationships I've been hearing about in the last few months make absolutely no sense to me when I compare them to what I believe constitutes a relationship.  The neighbours that live above me regularily use profanity when talking to each other.  The young unmarried couple are borderline abusive to each other by saying things such as, "...you're an asshole--you make me feel like s***..." or "...don't f***ing get mad at me..." and so forth and so on.  Their language shows that they have absolutely no respect for each other.  I know of a married couple struggling through the first few years of their marriage, and it has already degenerated to a point where the husband took his frustrations out on his wife by changing the locks to keep her out of the house.  And don't get me started on the over-fifty-percent divorce rate in North America.  Marriage viewed in such a way makes it appear like a gamble, and in this case 1-in-2 odds are not very favourable.  There's way too much to lose in such a risky game.  So based on this track record, one of the questions that I would like to ask: if there is so much to lose, why even consider a committed relationship?  If people go into a relationship with a list of rigid, unyielding expectations, or worse yet enter it with absolutely no consideration of compatibility, value comparison, respect, self-respect, self analysis, honesty both to others and to self, good judgement, realism, confidence and humility, then wouldn't you figure out that the relationship stands a much less chance of succeeding?  The only answers I can come up with (based on my own talent for running relationships into the ditch occasionally) are things like self-indulgence, impatience, lack of self-confidence, neediness, and unresolved personal issues.  Can you imagine a world where young people take the time and effort to FIRST build their own character, FIRST explore their individual goals and dreams, FIRST resolve personal issues, FIRST challenge themselves and their own thoughts and beliefs, and FIRST realize that in order to be in a relationship that one should be whole, established (mentally, emotionally, physically, financially, etc.) and have definitive life direction BEFORE making a commitment that would have a huge impact on their life, their partner's life, and the lives of those around them?  Perhaps we have given ourselves too much permission to make such a big decision.  I know I have.

       Reflect and Assess, Serve Ice Cold with a Twist  In my opinion, one of the most interesting things to do is read what you have written a year ago.  I wrote this "autopsy assessment" about a first date I had in February of last year.  I had met this girl at a social event for Single Volunteers of Calgary and liked her enough to ask her out for coffee.  She seemed harmless, but my overly analytical nature got the better of me and I wrote what appears to me now as a very unemotional scientific report of someone who appeared to be absolutely incompatible with me.  Even though the assessment helped me make a very clear and straight-forward decision to never see the girl again, I'm amazed at how cold I can be:  Quotes by My Date  "My boyfriend (of 5 years) was two inches shorter than me...one day I looked down at him and thought, 'what am I doing with such a short man?'"  "I have no desire to have children..at all."  "I am busy every single day this week."  "I don't believe that a person should be 'complete and whole' in order to be in a relationship."  "I don't want to be an environmental engineer because I do not like the work environment.  I have no idea what I am going to do now."  *****  Strike 1: did not attempt to contact me until over a week since asking for her email address.  Failed to inform me until the moment of contact that she doesn't have a computer and only checks her email very occasionally at the library.  Strike 2: dressed sloppily at our first date--hiking boots, old shirt, jeans...she didn't look concerned about creating a good first impression.  Perhaps that is her personal style, but it is not mine.  Strike 3: drives an old-model truck.  Suggests that she has a small-town personality and habits.  I do not have this mentality.  Strike 4: does not have a current life direction...no career, no school, no plans.  Even having a plan would be sufficient to ease my concern about her, and she didn't even have that.  Strike 5: personal values are too different from mine--her choice evening of fun is going to the bar to see the strippers, she never wants to have children, she doesn't believe people should be comfortable with themselves and be managing their own life successfully before getting into relationships.  Strike 6: she gave a reason which was a contribution to her last  relationship failing--her discomfort with shorter men.  I am shorter than she is, so she must be uncomfortable with me as well.  Results of date autopsy: not a good match, decidedly bad move to have a relationship.

       Dousing the Flames  I cannot even BEGIN to tell you how disappointed I am in the Calgary Flames.  I don't remember the last time I was actually angry with a hockey team, but to see such a strong team appear to just "give up" in the first part of the game made my blood boil.  The Flames looked like they were sleeping in the 1st and 2nd periods.  They played Game 7 pitifully up until the last 10 minutes of the 3rd period in which, only then, did they decided to wake up and get things rolling.  Their belated effort was too little, too late, and Tampa Bay ended up winning the Stanley Cup 2-1.  Tampa deserved to win that particular game, but really Calgary deserved to win the series.  Choke.  Made an attempt to at least make healthier lunches for myself.  Today's lunch consisted of roast turkey on 60% wheat with cucumbers, cheddar and a smidge of mayo, along with carrot sticks, apple and a Five Alive on the side.  I'm getting ready to make a plunge into a higher-end gym and even look into getting a personal trainer for a couple of months to get me back into the swing of things.  I've been out of cardio kickboxing since February and my strength and conditioning could use a boost in those areas.  But there's still the matter of getting new athletic shoes.  Oh how I need to win a small lottery jackpot right about now!

       I swear to God, I will keep blogging even if I get fired from my job.  (Heh, I don't have any work at the moment so there's little chance of that happening, at least today!)  I'm tired, but it's a good kind of tired.  I'm not sure if it was from the rainstorm last night or the game on Saturday night.  Game 6 between the Flames and the Lightning certainly contributed to the exhausting weekend.  Kudos to Erwin for hosting yet another great BBQ party, and this time with a widescreen projector for us hockey fans!  (I wonder if he would consider having the occasional DVD movie night.)  The weather held out that night, but Sunday night was a different story.  It POURED rain most of the night.  It was the same kind of rainstorm that you see out in Seattle or Vancouver--nonstop and heavy.  We really needed it, but it made for a damp morning today.  I made the mistake of trying to cool off my car on Saturday night by LEAVING THE WINDOWS OPEN and forgetting to close them the next day.  I felt really stupid this morning.  The inside is still kind of wet...I had to leave the windows open again here at work to try to avoid any mold from growing.  Right at the moment, it looks very grey outside and I hope it doesn't rain again today.  Last night I had a bit of a fit.  Loneliness creeped up from behind and caught me offguard.  Yet again, I found myself thinking of Olivia, a (then) 39-year-old woman I met on Lavalife last year and went out with on one single date; for some silly reason I was considering making the attempt to hook up with her again.  I shook my head and fought off this desperation by saying a little prayer and having a small talk with God.  At least the prayer helped me to fall asleep and keep the troubled thoughts temporarily muffled.  I really have troubles expressing myself.  I think the years of learning from Dad how to keep emotions bottled up has really rubbed off onto me.  And when they finally do surface, those around me aren't sure how to take it.  I try to express myself in a healthy positive way, but sometimes it doesn't work.  Sometimes Claire takes it as a personal jab or criticism, and it really isn't...I just need someone to listen to my gripes and she doesn't like it when I, or anyone for that matter, dumps on her.  My guy friends seem very disconnected with this sort of thing so I don't even try with them.  Only very rarely does my mother try to listen, but most times she automatically tries to tell me what I am doing wrong, and of course all I wanted was for her to listen, not for her to try to "fix me."  Massie is great to talk to about this sort of thing, but she lives in Edmonton and is a busy girl so is hardly ever available.  I'm still on non-speaking terms with Karen so to go to her is out of the question.  So who is left that is available and is patient enough to listen?  1) Ariel, my pen pal in Alabama, and 2) my friend Jamie who is VERY compassionate and patient.  My troubling thoughts over the past 3 months are starting to take their toll.  I have quit the gym out of frustration and my eating habits have taken a dive.  As such it looks like I've gained around 10 pounds.  I don't know for sure, but I can see it around my waist.  The stress from my noisy and immature neighbours upstairs is also adding to my health problems.  However I'm being affected by fear of moving to yet another place where I will yet again be subjected to uncooperative and disruptive neighbours.  (I left my previous place because of unsafe conditions, and made a bad choice to move here.)  I am planning to buy a new home, but thinking about the consequences of buying a place with bad neighbours has absolutely frozen my plans and keeps me from moving forward.  I am suffering much more than I let on to my friends or family.  And there's not really anyone I can talk to about this.  I can't trust anyone but myself.  I have no choice but to rely on myself to get me out of this....again.

       Welcome to the new Blogspot format!  I guess Google's purchase of Blogspot inspired the staff to upgrade and upbeat the site format.  They now offer a whole new set of blogging templates, so I took the opportunity to try a new one.  It looks better than the old one, but still not quite right.  I'll keep this template until I can find a better one on the Web.  Funny how I've totally lost the urge to write.  I honestly feel like nothing's worth mentioning at the moment, other than I've not started the home-buying process.  I intend to change that starting next week....

       I'm not going to be writing too much about my own personal problems anymore...there's just too much for me to handle at the present time.&nbsp; Dumping on all of my friends and family just isn't the answer.  Last night and this morning I was in the process of making an offer on a townhouse&nbsp;in the north part of Calgary when the fear, anxiety&nbsp;and negative gut feelings totally overwhelmed me to the point of physical illness.&nbsp; I have wayyy too much trepidation of putting myself under financial stress and moving away from my best friend.&nbsp; A few hours ago I talked out my feelings with Claire, who was supportive and kind.&nbsp; I decided to phone my realtor and withdraw my offer.&nbsp; I felt bad for both the sellers and the realtor, but I do think that this is the best decision, rather than taking a gamble and thinking I can handle the responsibilities.&nbsp; I need time to really REALLY figure out if I am ready to give up the downtown lifestyle and financial freedom I currently have.  I felt torn between taking advantage of "lower" housing prices and low interest rates, as well as trying to financially keep up with Erwin who is already a townhouse owner, keep up with the expectations of my mother, and keep up with the pressure of moving to the next stages of my life before I was financially and emotionally ready.  I feel a little better now that the pressure is off, but now I feel incredibly lost.&nbsp; I have tricked myself for so long into thinking this was the right thing to do, that I don't know what to think anymore.  I have also felt pressure&nbsp;at work to perform, and felt pressure to find a girlfriend/potential wife.&nbsp; I'm so disgusted at what's going on in all aspects of my life compared to where my friends and coworkers are: they are already home-owners, getting into serious relationships, getting engaged or having babies.&nbsp; When I look at myself and compare, everything is one big disappointment.&nbsp; I feel so worthless right now.&nbsp; My life has been delayed because I couldn't figure out who I was and what I really wanted during my twenties, and now in my thirties I find myself lagging in the race.  I will be going down to Lethbridge with my sister during the long weekend--perhaps this fence-painting job we need to do for Mom will help me relax and sort things out.

       How am I feeling tonight you ask? Pretty damn unappreciated if you must know!   I just got off the phone with my mother and basically yelled at her and chewed her head off for criticizing me and telling me what to do in looking for a new home. She denied everything she said, as is the usual. She doesn't have the ability inside her to say she's sorry about anything she's said or done. She can't use words of encouragement and support...that's way beyond her capability. She always has to be right.   You know, I really don't understand that the people in my life (with the exception of Claire) either a) treat me like I'm 12 years old--they don't trust my judgement or course of actions and feel the need to push me around and offer nothing but constant criticism or unwelcome advice when I don't ask for it and don't care to ask what I want or need, or b) use me as some sort of crutch or punching bag and basically use me as a tool to satisfy something they need, like I'm their dad or something. I'm not your dad!   That makes me so fucking mad. I am still angry as spit at Des because she decided not to care about my feelings and decided it was ok for her to vent at me about the problems with her father. Christ almighty, at least she has the opportunity in the future to try to work things out with her father. I don't get to have that luxury because my dad DIED LAST YEAR...at least you still HAVE a dad!!   Let me make it perfectly clear about my current situation: I just finished working a 60-hour work week, both evenings and weekends, spent time on house-hunting, and on top of that I'm still dealing with the childish neighbours upstairs who make my apartment an unpleasant environment to come home to.   I've had no sleep, I've now caught a cold because of the constant stress, and I certainly don't need to deal with all of you who don't care enough about me to ask a simple question like "do you want to talk about your problems" or "let's go for a coffee and chat and I'll listen to you" or "don't worry about it Brian, I've got it" or one of the most important questions I want to hear from others: "Brian, I value your judgement, what do you think?"   In the past couple of years, I've learned that the only way to make myself heard is to be arrogant and pushy. Otherwise everyone else's priorities will ALWAYS overshadow and suffocate mine. I have to protect myself, because I'm the only one who's got my own back. Again you've proven that I can trust only one person to say the above things to me, and that's me.   Thanks for being so sensitive. Thanks for nothing.
