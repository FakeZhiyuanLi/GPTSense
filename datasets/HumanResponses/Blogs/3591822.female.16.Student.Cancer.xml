      LiveJournal is being stupid. TIME FOR SOME BLOGGY HAPPY FUN TIMES OH BOY!!!  TODAY I....did nothing much.   ok interupting broadcast. I'm listening to Gary Beals on the radio.LOLOLOLOL it's actually an ok song. ~~Summer days are made for people in love, summer nights are made for lovers!~~ *dances*   erm...that never happened. Look away.  SO today I hung out at home and was bored. I joined Habbo Hotel. http://habbo.ca  fucking join you fucking fucks. Sam's all addicted to it. I'm still a little intimidated though. I can feel an e-obsession coming on...OH NO SWIM AWAY, SWIM AWAY! I've also been more active on E-SPIN THE BOTTLE http://www.e-spinthebottle.com/ I met 2 guys by sending them notes. They're cool but I don't talk to them much. The only person to send me a note so far was a girl so I think I better edit my profile...it's swinging a little too far to the lesbian side of things. I went on a BOOK ADVENTURE! It was not as awesome as it appeared before I left though. First I found 24 Woozles book cards, that's 10 dollars off a book. They went back to 1997. Fucking rock on. I found a $20 bill and lot's of change and my Library card. OFF I WAS ON MY ADVENTURE. BUT while walking downtown I got weird looks from people and I started to feel sad. At Woozles I bought "Princess in pink" 5th book of the Princess Diaries series. I didn't go to the library in the end, and I also didn't go to Subway like I had planned. I did go to the Big G, but Fred wasn't there ;_; Then while walking up my street I saw Jordan and I think he said Hi *confused face* but I wasn't really paying attention so now I'LL ALWAYS WONDER. geez. Ok then some stuff happened and cue the evening it's dark out and I was lying on my deck on a beach towel and couch pillows reading my book. What a load of crap. The series went so far down hill I think I'll vomit. So far I've read 20 pages (it's hard to read fast when the book sucks) and it was all Mia whining that her boyfriend hasn't asked her to Prom. SO GIRLY AND GROSS AND EEWWWWWW. Fuck you Meg Cabot for abusing the knowledge that people will buy whatever crap you stuff into this series. The 3rd book should have finished it, but nooooo, you had to keep milking this money cow. Now there's a second movie. IT'S NOT EVEN THE SAME STORY. Everyone's only going to see it for Julie Andrews actually singing a song. BUT BUT BUT YOU HAD TO RUIN THAT BY HAVE RAVEN SING WITH HER. Fuck. You really are a retard. I am so angry. >:(    That prom stuff set off another rant. I don't have a boyfriend, and I never did have one since I was 12 so maybe I just don't know how things work. But it seems to me if you're going out with someone it should be a given that you go to dances together. You shouldnt have to be shy and whatever anymore. You know they like you back, they are your BOYFRIEND for crying outloud. What the hell am I missing here? This must be why no one likes me, I'm not a freakin idiot...geez.  I'm still really angry for not really good reasons.  oh how I love my bloggy :)  OH OH you see how it says "look away" up there? well I just read that and remembered where I got it. OH MY GOD i love those beer commercials!!  ~often I've dreamed of standing at a lake of beer...but not like this, never like this  ~*sings*I'VE GOT A DATE ON SATURDAY ~What do you get when you cross a beer drinker with a hand talker? ^__^   I dunno...   A spilly talker >:( Dumping the pride of nova scotia (and so on) yay beer commercials yay. I must be the only person ever to love those. I don't even drink beer.  On the subject of commercials, I freakin love the White Point commercials. You know? "Rush hour, at white point" and they show something not rushed at all. I only love the Sand Piper one. All the little birdies go running from the water and ITS SO ADORABLE! deedlydee deedlydee deedlydee (this is birdies running noise) GO BIRDIES GO!!  wow I can just go on and on and on can't I?  It's really fun for me. I dont know why. Well readers who dont exsist, I hope you liked it!

      I forgot about my blog!! aww, poor blog :(  THERE ARE 7 MINUTES AND 4 DAYS UNTIL I'M 16!!! w00t!  At dinner today Stephane was like "why are you excited? you're only turning 15." and I'm like "good job, way to know how old your sister is. Way to imply I'll graduate at the age of 16."   We're going to get our HORRIBLE computer fixed soon! Mom was trying to add up how much it would be. We need to fix the sound, get a new printer and get a new moniter (just for it to function, not for it to be good) If it's worth it we may just get a whole new everything!! Woah I just remembered we have a scanner. I don't think it's EVER worked :S We should get a new scanner too. And a webcam. *sigh* excuse me for dreaming.  3 minutes 4 days.  Me and Samia suck so much. Today all we did was bug boys, watch Barney and play Wheel of Fortune on N64. You see, I hooked up all the exciting (aka old) electronics in my room. I now have a TV that my parents bought in Germany in the 80's, an almost-as-old-as-that VCR, a SNES and a N64. We have a really odd selection of games for those that my bro's friend gave to us. It includes wheel of fortune, double copies of at least 3 games, lots of wrestling games and a game shark.   Back to me and Sam, while watching Barney we were singing along and making fun of the small children. THEN we noticed one of the samll children DID NOT HAVE A RIGHT HAND. You couldnt tell cuz she was always holding it in her left hand. BUT THEN she hugged Barney and it just wasn't there and we were like EEK.   please excuse me I have to go watch the super fun elections. GO BLOC QUEBECOIS GO!! (lol no, never)  LESS THAN 4 DAYS
