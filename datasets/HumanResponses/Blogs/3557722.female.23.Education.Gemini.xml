      sooo....Democratic National Convention tonight.  Let's get this party started!  Took my first spinning class today; it kicked my butt.    Well, I don't have much else to say.  I'm reading Simon Winchester's book  The Professor and the Madman .  Started it months ago, and loved it, but I guess I became distracted.  Now now I'm going to finish it.   In fact, I'm forcing myself to finish it before I start another Edith Wharton book, or any other book for that matter.  That's my plan.  Now I'm rambling.  Bye!

      Today on netscape.com:     The Dictionary Gets Sexed Up!  Ooh la la! The English language officially has a new word: va-va-voom. The venerable Oxford English Dictionary knows how to keep up with the times. Va-va-voom is "the quality of being exciting, vigorous, or sexually attractive," according to the compilers of the 11th edition of the Oxford Concise English Dictionary.

      I can't watch the news.  It's too emotional, especially today with the 9/11 report.  Since we're close to New York City, DC, and the Western Pennsylvania field where the plane went down, stations around here are showing reactions of victims' families to the 9/11 Commission.  One station just aired the brother of the pilot in the PA plane, who happens to live in Lancaster.  Just too incredibly sad...

      I just weeded-- real weeding-- for the first time.  Growing up in suburbia with parents who aren't into flower beds, I guess the opportunity never arose.  I now live in an apartment complex, but outside my door, underneath my front window, I have a little strip of dirt.    The girl who lived here before me had planted annuals, so when I moved in last August I enjoyed those flowers until they turned into earth.  Ice and frost came with winter, and my strip kept itself free from any choking weeds or life at all; in Spring I was surprised by the daffodills that bloomed on their own, but who were soon mangled in a wind storm.  But since then it's just been me and my strip, and the weeds.  Every few days I would pull a few, which kept the strip looking decent, but during my recent hiatus at my parents' house, the wild green took over.  I half thought about pulling them all out yesterday, when I returned to the apartment, but quickly dismissed that idea.  Then today, just now, I went on a walk and something inside of me snapped.  Maybe it was peering at everybody else's dirt strips-- theirs decked out with flowers of all varieties which I couldn't name-- that forced my decision.   I looked at my strip and decided it was time.  I patiently weeded.  Every so often I peered up at two young Mormons, donned in dress shirts and ties, trying to talk to a neighbor who was playing catch with his son.  I've seen them over there before.   The weeding was hard work, but I had the strip looking maintained in only a half hour or so.  As I attempted to pick the muck out from underneath my fingernails, I said a prayer for the two dressed-up guys and another for my neighbors down the street, and vowed to buy mums this fall and display them outside in  some  way.

      I wish they had coffee delivery, like they have pizza delivery.  I mean... coffee is so what I want right now, but I haven't the motivation or the resources (left my coffee maker at my parents' house; I do, however, have the espresso maker...) to even think about making my own. And actually leaving the apartment-- that's out of the question.  Instead I'm sitting here eating the "100 Calorie Pack Chips Ahoy!"-- the latest diet snack food.  They're surprisingly good, except they have that nasty partially hydrogenated soybean oil crap in it.  In case you were wondering, yes the ingredients actually read "Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil Crap."  Between these "Chips Ahoys!" and my "Parkay Butter Spray" I will probably have a clogged heart or something in 5 years.  Oh well :p.

      So I'm considering today my first  real  day of summer for a number of reasons, none of which I will explain (though feel free to click  urlLink here      for further insights into this phenomenon).  Finally with a moment to sit and think, I'm wondering how I should handle this time of my own.   This has been my day so far:    8:00-10:00 am:  car inspection.  I fear and dread having to take my car to get worked on.  Too many men in those places... makes me self-conscious.  I must get my car inspected more than once a year.  It feels like I'm always going to do that.  Buried myself in  Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim  by David Sedaris and drank Burger King coffee while I waited (patiently, I might add) for my car.      10:10-10:30 am: hairdresser.  I had them "fix" my haircut from last week, to which I never got accustomed.  But it looks much better now-- cuter and actually remniscient of that famous ice skater in the 70s who popularized the 'ol bob haircut, only trendier.  Aaanyway.....  10:40-11:40: grocery shopping, that dreaded chore.  At least now I have PICKLES!    11:59-present (12:51): lunch, phone call, poking around with my blogs  Like I earlier stated, I'm pondering what I really should do with this time.  I have a few goals:  1.  read a lot 2.  read  The Moon is Down  to get ready to teach it come fall. 3.  Plan some units for school 4.  clean closet at parents' house 5.  clean closet at apartment  At least #2,3,4,5 I plan on putting off a little while longer, which leaves me with 1, and while that's perfectly fine with me, I feel rather monastic just sitting here  reading day after day and not, you know, getting out at all.  Oh yeah, my other goal (#6) is to lose 6 pounds.  But that's not a really significant goal.  Well, I'll figure things out.  What will most likely happen is I'll end up reading and drinkig coffee and lounging around until mid-August, at which time I will rush around cleaning closets and reading Steinbeck and getting things ready for school and then before I know it life will be back to normal.  This is a nice situation in which to be, I must admit.  Three cheers for summer, I love it.  I think this post lost its point... did I ever have a point?

      That is, "The big-antelered deer was a dandy" in Boontling.  I've spent much of the day with my articles about this vocabulary (It's not a language or a dialact because it lacks its own grammar and phonology).  Boontling is actually more of a jargon or lingo that was spoken by about 500 people living in the Anderson Valley of California from 1880-1920.  As I've pointed out in my paper, there are many different theories as to how this invented language originated.    Some people think it all started when a group of women wanted to gossip about another (pregnant & unwed) woman with whom they were working.  Another theory suggests that it was made up by a group of young men while shearing sheep and playing in the local baseball league.  Many other theories float around, too.  Whichever one is true, however, what's cool about this is that most people agree the words in this vocabulary were created to keep outsiders from understanding what they were saying.  Every little kid's dream, huh?  As time passed, they simply kept coining new words until there were literally thousands of words in use by the residents.    The language finally died off in the 1920s for several reasons: telephones and automobiles increased contact of the natives with the outside world, local industries brought in hundreds of laborers who mocked how the natives spoke.  Today, reliable sources say there's a handful of speakers left, but the younger generations don't seem to be keen on keeping it alive.    Here are some cool Boontling words I've learned:     Apple-head - Girl friend   Briney - Ocean   Bucky - A nickel   Cock a Fister - To fight   Deek - To look or see   Frattey - Wine  Gorm - Food, or to eat  Greymatter - The brain; To think.  Harp - To speak, esp. to speak Boontling.  Shoveltooth - a doctor, an M.D. String - to kill, maim, or beat thoroughly Zeese - coffee  If this interests you at all, there are many enjoyable webpages dedicated to Boontling; just do a Google search.

      Since  urlLink bibliotaph  is devoted to my "life with books," I thought I'd carry on with the rest of life on another blog. Bibliotaph is still my baby, but it is here where I will post absolutely anything I darn well feel like posting.  Woohoo how liberating.    To get the ball rolling, here is the Simon and Garfunkel song which sparked the URL for this site.  These are wonderful lyrics.    "Hazy Shade of Winter"  Time, Time, Time, see what's become of me While I looked around for my possibilities.  I was so hard to please. Look around, Leaves are brown, And the sky is a hazy shade of winter.  Hear the Salvation Army band. Down by the riverside's Bound to be a better ride Than what you've got planned.  Carry your cup in your hand. And look around. Leaves are brown. And the sky is a hazy shade of winter.  Hang on to your hopes, my friend. That's an easy thing to say, But if your hopes should pass away Simply pretend that you can build them again. Look around, The grass is high, The fields are ripe, It's the springtime of my life.  Seasons change with the scenery; Weaving time in a tapestry. Won't you stop and remember me At any convenient time? Funny how my memory skips Looking over manuscripts Of unpublished rhyme.  Drinking my vodka and lime, I look around, Leaves are brown, And the sky is a hazy shade of winter.

      My project for today is to read Steinbeck's  The Moon is Down  (not the play; the novel.)  I hope I can finish it by tonight... it looks like a quickie-- only 100 pages.  I actually would like to teach it this school year to those oh-so-excited about literature and life 15 year olds. ;)  I'm getting borderline obsessive about finishing my self-imposed "book list" by the end of summer, I think.  But it's a good thing.  I've been totally enjoying myself through it all, and have learned a lot about literature and about myself, actually.  I'm sure when the summer's over and the books have been read I'll blog about it.  For sure.    So I woke up really late this morning and watched the tail end of  The Cosby Show 's finale episode.  WOW I just love that show.  And that finale makes me cry every time.    And speaking of sleeping really late, this summer I've re-learned the art of sleeping all morning.  I'm trying not to feel guilty about that.   "Roll out the lazy hazy crazy days of summer Those days of soda and pretzels and beer..."

       "A panda walks into a cafe.  He orders a sandwich, eats it, then draws a gun and fires two shots in the air.       'Why?' asks the confused waiter, as the panda makes towards  the exit.  The panda produces a badly punctuated wildlife manual and tosses it over his shoulder.       'I'm a panda,' he says, at the door.  'Look it up.'      The waiter turns to the relevant entry and, sure enough, finds     an explanation.     'Panda .  Large black-and-white bear-like mammal,     native to China.  Eats, shoots and leaves.'"   Oh the joys of punctuation jokes!  I've spent the last two days with  many similar joys, while reading this and other punctuation puns in  Lynne Truss's (now I'm nervous that apostrophe is misplaced, what  with writing about a punctuation book and all...) "Runaway #1 British Bestseller,"  Eats(,) Shoots & Leaves .    From the depths of my English language-loving soul, I recommend this  book to you and the ones you love.  In it, Truss leads the reader through  the pains and joys of living with what she terms her "seventh sense," or her habit of spotting punctuation errors practically everywhere.  She  clarifies:          "While we look in horror at a badly punctuated sign, the        world carries on around us, blind to our plight.  We are        like the little boy in  The Sixth Sense  who can        see dead people, except that we can see dead punctuation.         Whisper it in petrified little-boy tones: dead punctuation        is invisible to everyone else-- yet we see it all the time.         No one understands us seventh-sense people.  They regard us        as freaks...It's tough being a stickler for punctuation        these days.  One almost dare not get up in the mornings."    Do you have this seventh sense?  Are you a stickler?   If this  passage resonates with you, if it speaks to you as no one before  has of the misused (or omitted) forms of punctuation so rampant  in our world, you really ought to read this one.    As an avid semicolon fan, I particularly enjoyed the chapter  entitled "Airs and Graces," in which Truss explains a brief history of the underrated semicolon, the controversy surrounding the semicolon, as well as the usage of it.  Comprehensive, I tell you.   What more can I ask for on my summer vacation?     Well, time to go run up hills and study features of American dialects.         urlLink      You can also see this cover and read more about my initial  experience with this book on a previous post, entitled "Oops, I  Did it Again."

        I had the story, bit by bit, from various people, and, as  generally happens in such cases, each time it was a different story. If you know Starkfield, Massachusetts, you know the post office.  If you know the post office you must have seen Ethan Frome drive up to it, drop the reins on his hollow-backed bay and drag himself across  the brick pavement to the white colonnade: and you must have asked  who he was.   Enticing, isn't it?  Those are the first few sentences of Edith  Wharton's simple, beautiful  Ethan Frome .  Set in nineteenth century rural New England, Wharton writes of the  taciturn  Ethan Frome , whose undying love for his wife's cousin leads to his destruction.  In her terse yet evocative prose, Wharton weaves this tale of a man smothered by unfulfilling marriage  and society's strigent bounds.    I read this book in one fell swoop, and I recommend reading it  quickly.  Doing so helped me   feel  Wharton's intensity  all the more.  I love this book!   urlLink     Wharton, Edith.   Ethan Frome .  Signet.  New York: 2000.    (That's just this particular edition's info; this novel was originally  published in 1911.)

      Lauren Winner is a kindred spirit, I've decided.   Girl Meets God  and    Mudhouse Sabbath  are both honest, reflective, and  beautifully written.  Now  here  is touching memoir.    urlLink      In her first book ( Girl Meets God ), Ms. Winner traces her conversions to Orthodox Judaism, and then finally to Christianity.  She focuses on  both the beautiful and heart-breaking aspects of the conversion  experience while allowing the reader a glimpse into her relationships,  experiences, and traditions that shape her new spiritual life.  Great read!   urlLink     In  Mudhouse Sabbath -- a sort of companion to  Girl Meets God - Winner concludes that even though she's now a practicing Episcopal, her  beloved Judaism will always shape how she practices religion.  She writes  of the value in eleven different Jewish religious traditions such as  candle-lighting, mourning, and food, and explains how her old rituals  (which she at first relinquished upon conversion) only enhance her life  now as a Christian.  I relate to this book, as Winner's deeply rooted  traditional religion remind me of my Orthodox Christian upbringing.   This is a wonderful book.

       urlLink     Dyer, Geoff.    Yoga for People Who Can't Be Bothered to Do It .  Random House. New York: 2003.  In   Yoga for People Who Can't Be Bothered to Do It ,  40-something Geoff Dyer explains how his world travels have helped  him--sometimes gracefully, sometimes not-so-gracefully-- grow up.   Through his loosely connected sketches of travel destinations,  girlfriends, and drug-addict acquaintances, he traces his steps from young-adulthood into adulthood.  But the one question is: Do we  really care?   My   answer is no.  With intriguing memoir,  the author lures us in, he makes us care.  Geoff Dyer does not.  While mildly amusing in the beginning, his drugs and his flings and even his  feelings get old-- because of the fundamental problem with this book-- he doesn't connect with his readers.  He doesn't make us care about him  or his life.  Now don't get me wrong, this book is not  terrible .   But it's not fabulous either.  It's  okay .  I confess, I was attracted to Geoff Dyer's book mostly because of the title, and the light green cover, and the fact that it's categorized under Travel/ Memoir.  And while it did have its comical and interesting  parts, don't bother.  With all the amazing literature out there, don't  waste time with this one.

      Someone recently reminded me of how much I love the writing of Flannery O'Connor.  She's one of these authors that keep popping up in my life.  Before my beau and I were "official," we bonded (or flirted?) by reading her short stories out loud.  There were also those times where some friends and me would read a story by passing the book around a table and each taking a turn to read. :) And who can forget that blessed day as an undergrad, on the first day of American Writers II class.  Each person picked an American author's name from a hat, and would then prepare a presentation on that author.  Lo & behold, I "randomly" chose Flannery (I put "randomly" in quotes because instead of thinking that it was a totally random thing, I think it was more like divine intervention!).  And now, I just remembered her again.    Flannery O'Connor is great summertime reading, and great anytime reading.  I'm particularly fond of her book entitled Mystery and Manners, as well as the short stories called "A Good Man is Hard to Find" and "Everything That Rises Must Converge."    This author constructs pitiful, grotesque, and absorbing characters reflective of her Southern roots, but relative to anyone who's, well, a human being living in our chaotic, blessed world.     urlLink    Flannery O'Connor

       urlLink      I am nearly finished reading  Harry Potter and the Chamber of  Secrets .  The  Harry Potter  books make me want to be a  child, so I can experience them with the anticipation and excitement  of someone younger.    Do I read with child-like anticipation? I hope so, and sometimes I feel like I do, but reading like kids often read-- fully absorbed, "this book is my whole entire world" reading-- I miss that.    J.K. Rowling entices readers of many ages.  She draws people in.  That's why both old and young and many people in between feel like they are part of the action-- studying spells at Hogwarts, playing Quidditch  with Harry, and scheming with Hermoine.    While I am not growing up with Harry Potter, the books give me a nostalgic "I'm going to stay in bed all morning and read till mom  tells me to get up" feeling.  It's delightful.     urlLink      Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets   (British edition)

      Well, I'm here plugging away at my  Dialects in American English  course work, hopefully understanding the concepts.  Today's class was interesting-- information intensive, though not exhausting.  But  yesterday-- now there was a class.  The two hours sped by; I was  focused and enthralled.    And I'm  compelled  to blog here about a special something  that enthralled me.  Call me uninformed, but never before did I  realize that the dialect of English The Bard himself spoke was actually closer in pronunciation to our American modern-day English (forgive me for making such a broad generalization) than to modern- day British English (yes, another generalization).  It's all because British English has actually evolved much more than our American  English has (this is a.k.a. Colonial Lag).  Fascinating stuff, huh?    Shakespeare people everywhere, do you know what this means?  Imagine Kenneth Branaugh's productions, sans the British accent.  Imagine a RSC (Royal Shakespeare Company) production where the actors speak American.  Friends, that's probably-- dare I say it-- closer to how Shakespeare and his players spoke.  Shakespeare might've sounded  more like we Americans sound.    It's a wild, nearly frightening notion!  What I've been thinking  about, though, is that modern British English is surely what  Shakespeare would speak if he were alive today.  Even though he  never spoke it, I'm sure his British actors speaking different English than he spoke wouldn't phase him; the man embodied  avant-garde .  He'd want the speech of the times, not some archaic lect.          Linguists, forgive my rudimentary understanding and explanation.  This explanation is as far as  my  understanding reaches,  which isn't far, as I'm only three days into my class. =)

      I didn't know this afternoon during a recent Barnes & Noble run that I would get the biggest hankering to read one of the books I cherished as an adolescent.  I was standing there in the music section, of all sections, and suddenly felt the urge to re-read Judy Blume's   Just as Long as We're Together  .    I have a long history with that book. I might have been 13 when I went to visit my dear friend Leah in Cleveland.  Leah happened to cherish that book.  It was yellow paperback, with yellow border around a picture of three girls together in a bedroom that had a canope bed (if I remember it correctly).  I remember reading it at her house, and us talking about it, and the two of us reading it together.  We loved it; we practically worshipped it.    I borrowed   Just as Long as We're Together   from Leah, and returned it to her the following summer when we reunited.  For its year with me, the book stayed in a special place-- next to my bed in a drawer of my nightstand.   Now, ten years later (could ten years have passed?) I'm harboring deep urges to read it, and have no other desire but to curl up on the couch and read as many chapters as possible before falling asleep...  By the way, I also bought a New Yorker (the June 14 & 24); a few things in there look interesting.      urlLink    the new cover: sweet, but now how I remember it.

      Peter and I took two New York City virgins to the city yesterday: Marcos (a Brazilian staying with Peter's family for a year) and Josh (14 year-old brother of Peter; claims he "doesn't go anywhere.")  We had a grand time.  Saw Ellis Island, Ground Zero, and some of the city from Port Authority Bus Terminal to lower Manhattan on our bus down to the ferry.  Because we were thinking and talking of ferries, Edna St. Vincent Millay's poem " urlLink Recuerdo " that reads,"We were very tired, and we were very merry--/ We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry--/ And you ate an apple, and I ate a pear/ From a dozen of each we had bought somewhere/ And the sky went wan, and the wind came cold;/ And the sun rose dripping, a bucketful of gold" was stuck in my head! But that's only the second stanza.   Another poet running through the mind yesterday is none other than THE NYC poet, Frank O'Hara.  Every time I walk in midtown Manhattan, I invariably think of him walking fast(usually solo) on his lunch break from work at the   urlLink MoMA , watching the people, thinking about art, and life, and who he was meeting for dinner.  I was thinking about " urlLink Song " in particular, probably because I obsessively wash my hands in the city.  No, I don't refuse to breathe though. ha ha.    How funny-- I sat down to write this post, feeling guilty that I wasn't intending to write on anything literary (this is, after all, a blog dedicated to "a life with books,") but I manage to squeeze out at least a little about poetry.  And I swear, this is no lie.  I really was thinking about Frank O'Hara, and Millay's "Recuerdo" poem.  And now I'm wondering-- does this all sound terribly presumptious?  Or does it simply capture the essence of bibliotaph, a life with hiding away words and ideas in one's heart?     Oh yes, and I DID get to go to Coliseum Books, my favorite independent bookstore, for 10 minutes!     urlLink    Coliseum Books

      The phenomenon on which I'm about to write revealed itself to me as I sought a name for my blog.  While I intensely entered potential blog names that had to do with books, I fast realized that so many of them were taken.  "Fine," I thought to myself, "That's totally fine.  Other people can have blogs about books, too."    Hmph.  If I only knew then what I know now.  I soon took a gander at these blogs with book names, only to discover that they are all pitiful failures.  See for yourself:  www.book.blogspot.com www.bookish.blogspot.com www.bookgirl.blogspot.com www.bookman.blogspost.com www.booklover.blogspot.com www.booklovers.blogspot.com www.read.blogspot.com www.literature.blogspot.com www.bibliophile.blogspot.com   What's the story here folks?  Why the book-blog neglect?  (or folk, since I think maybe--if I'm lucky-- one person actually reads this.  But then again, "folk" can be considered plural too, huh?).  Should I cry?  Should I bite my pencil?  Should I slowly shake my head in disgust?  Perhaps I'll go read Harry Potter.

      Books I'm reading now:  Rowling,  J.K. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.      (Okay, I know I'm the last person in the world to read this one...) The goal is        to finish before grad classes start on June 14. :)  Truss, Lynne.   Eats Shoots and Leaves.         Plan to read this one sporadically in between everything else; it's hilarious.        Discussed it in a previous post.  Dreiser, Theodore.   Sister Carrie.         Ahhh, Dreiser... So far so good.    Vonnegut, Kurt.   Slaughterhouse-Five.         Entertaining.  Solid literature.

      ...and succumbed to the English teacher urge to purchase yet another punctuation book.  Here's the scenario:  Went to Wal-Mart with mother and dad; we split up and I announced I was "going to look at books."  So there, amongst  Atkins for Life  and Hillary Clinton's  Living History  and Oprah's new book club choice (which is Tolstoy's  Anna Karenina , by the way... I wonder how many housewives will actually finish that one) sat this  Eats Shoots and Leaves ; memories of hearing the author-- Lynne Truss-- interviewed on NPR not too long ago flooded back to me.  All at once I seized the book and tried to resist the temptation to spend money.  Here's a small taste of my first battle, to which I promptly lost:  (I know this must be violating copyright laws... sshhh)        "Either this will ring bells for you, or it won't.  A printed banner has appeared on the coucourse of a petrol station near to where I live.  'Come inside," it says, "for CD's, VIDEO's, DVD's, and BOOK'S.'  If this satanic sprinkling of redundant apostrophes causes no little gasp of horror or quickening of the pulse, you should probably put down this book at once."   Do you understand the predicament?  Aside from genuinely being interested in the subject, the book itself practically commanded me not to put it back on the shelf and think "maybe some other day."  I kept reading, and was hooked.  Now it will happily sit betwixt  The Elements of Style  and  Woe is I  and all of those other fabulous books about writing and language and of course, style.  I will comment more on the actual book, of course, once I've actually read it.  Aren't you excited?   urlLink

      I think the only book I can remember "hiding" was   Forever   by Judy Blume.  As an avid Judy Blume fan in my pre-teenage years, I devoured every book she wrote.    Now, if you know about   Forever  , you know that it might not be THE book for an impressionable 12 year old (but on the other hand, if it's not for an impressionable 12 year old, then for whom, exactly, is it?), but alas, I read it secretly-- before bed, first thing in the morning, hiding out in my room-- and excitedly indulged my curiosity concerning Katherine and Michael's teenage sex life.    I didn't read secretly because my parents censored my books (they were laissez faire concerning such matters), but because the solitary prospect of either of my parents picking it up and skimming its pages was enough to seriously consider burying   Forever   in the back yard.   Thus, while    Forever   spent many hours under my mattress, it's actually the only book I can recall ever physically hiding. These days, it's more my style to both show off  books-- you know,  by displaying them throughout the apartment, by attempting to use them as centerpieces of my interior decorating-- and, as a friend once told me, to hide away books in my heart.  A few years ago I dug out my Judy Blume books from storage in an attempt to collect my teenage literature and add it to my bookshelves.  Interestinly,   Forever   never re-surfaced.  While it's most likely still in the attic, sometimes I like to daydream that its under the mattress of some sweet inquisitive 7th grader.

      This is one of my favorite passages from  Slaughterhouse-Five , Kurt Vonnegut's famous anti-war book:   "Later on, as a middle-aged optometrist, he would weep quietly and privately sometimes, but never make loud  boohooing  noises.   Which is why the epigraph of this book is the quatrain from the famous Christmas carol.  Billy cried very little, though he often saw things worth cryring about, and in  that  respect, at least, he resembled the Christ of the carol:  The cattle are lowing, The Baby awakes. But the little Lord Jesus No crying he makes. "   As an English teacher, I suppose I  should  love Vonnegut's book.  I finished it last night with a sigh of relief, though.  It's not that I didn't like it, per se; I just didn't connect with it very well.  I do, however, regard it highly.  It's wild, funny at times, and incredibly sad.  One of the endorsements on the back cover of my paperback explains Vonnegut's novel this way:    "Splendid art...a funny book at which you are not permitted to laugh, a sad book without tears." -Wilfred Sheed,  Life    Since reading that quote, and then the book, I think Wilfred Sheed hit it right on the money.  Although it's not a book I'll hold near and dear, it's emotional, interesting, intelligent.

      I stayed up till 2 AM last night finishing this one.  I think this was the first "history" I've ever read outside of reading for school-- I'm a novel junkie-- but it was no issue for me; this peculiar little account reads like a novel.  Winchester tells the story of a professor (the primary editor of the  Oxford English Dictionary , James Murray), and of a madman (Dr. William Minor, an instutionalized schizophrenic [but originallly placed in Broadmoor for murder, not necessarily illness],  who voluntarily procured thousands of the famous quotations found in the  OED  while living in his two book-lined asylum cells.)  Meticulous by day and "mad" by night, it's fascinating for me to consider whether or not Minor's schizophrenia might've enabled him to contribute so widely to the dictionary.  Mainly, however, this book is about how these two exraordinarily different men's lives intertwine to create one  Oxford English Dictionary .  Their story is remarkable.    Here are two excellent links:   urlLink NPR Interview with Winchester   urlLink Official Simon Winchester page  This specific page to which I'm linking deals with  Madman .

      There's a  urlLink  website   where you can read Edith Wharton's  Summer , but it's not for the faint of heart.  I just finished the book 10 minutes ago, and I'm still recovering.  In this tragic yet honest novel, Edith Wharton once again examines a woman's role in society.  In the case of Wharton's naive yet perceptive protagonist, Charity Royall, it's society's ideologies that keep her-- physically and emotionally-- from her deepest desires.  The second of Wharton's books set in New England,  Summer  traces the passionate love affair of Charity and Lucius Harney, two people who in the end, acquiesce to their environments and circumstances-- though neither of them victimized.  In fact, Susan Minot's writes in her introduction to the novel,  Wharton's heroines are not hapless victims, however; they understand their helplessness.  Charity Royall 'was bland and insensible to many things and dimly knew it, but to all that was light and air, perfume and colour, every drop in her responded.'  It is this heightened sensibility that animates Wharton's characters-- they are  aware .  While their awareness may deepen their tragedy, it also allows them to retain their dignity-- though sometimes at the cost of their lives.  I could've easily bawled my eyes out, for sure, but I was in such suspence that there was no time for tears.  During the latter half of the novel, especially, Wharton drives the plot toward its resolution with an Ethan Frome-like intensity.     Summer  is powerful!  Has anyone else read it?  I need to discuss this with someone.

       	 		 		 I refer to  Vogue  as my guilty pleasure, but I don't really know why.  I guess the notion of reading a fashion magazine while I have stacks of books waiting for me in my bedroom just... makes me feel the slightest bit guilty.  Yes,  Vogue  is girlish and trendy, but it's a pretty smart magazine, in all actuality.   Sophisticated.  Classy.  Adult.      As to writing about it here at Bibliotaph, my rationale is that while Vogue is not a book, it  is  quality reading material.  That said...  Since the August issue arrived in the mail yesterday, I've been glued to it... it's fabulous!  While focusing on what beauty means at different ages, the August issue includes interviews with people like the Presley women, the Bush daughters, Stella McCartney, Andre Agassi & Steffi Graf.  It also includes articles on topics ranging from the world's most interesting ice cream to how three women handle widowhood.  Just... really good stuff!  And people think  Vogue's  just about Paris runways... tsk tsk.  Anyway, I'm enjoying myself.    By the way, a post to come soon on Edith Wharton's  Summer .

       	 		 		 A friend recently told me he picked up a David Sedaris book, read some, but found his writing pretentious.  Even though this friend knows good writing and is quite a writer himself, I have to disagree.    Minutes ago, I finished  Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim , and found the author's essays choc-full of skillfull, hilarious prose.  Sedaris's writing of his life, childhood, and a motley crew of a family engrossed me, and I found myself thoroughly entertained.  I would describe Sedaris as not pretentious, but insightful.  And a fab writer.     urlLink Go here  for a quality D.S. interview with Terry Gross.   		 				 			     			 				 			 urlLink

      I like this blog's template, I really do.  In fact, I've always been a fan of polka dots.  One of my favorite features is the fun polka dots that appear before each title.  (Incidentally, those little dots only show up by using the "strong" command in the title field.  Let's consider that our little secret.)  My question is, are the polka dots in the background a bit much?  Are they tacky?  Over-the-top?  They were so fun, at first, but I'm left to wonder if they fit the mood of this blog.  Do they enhance the bibliotaph experience, or do they leave you feeling as if your screen has a rare skin disease (sorry, that was my pathetic attempt at some humor...)?  The dots are a little...hyper.  Personally, I think I'm growing tired of them, but like I mentioned before, I love the little dots before each entry, and I love those three big dots at the top of this blog.  Furthermore, I've sought out alternate templates, and nothing really suits my fancy.  So... any suggestions?  Keep the dots or not?   Changing the subject:  It's been a sort of hobby lately to surf on over to npr.org and do a search for interesting people, and then listen to old interviews, commentaries, and the like with those people.  I just found some clips of Lauren Winner reading excerpts from her book, and she sounds nothing like I had expected.  In my brain, I heard her voice as whimsical and girlish, but instead she sounds sophisticated and serious (I'm sure, however, she must possess all four of those traits).  Not that this is bad.  I'd like to be sophisticated and serious.  It's just that this voice differs from the voice I heard in my brain while reading her books.  It throws me off kilter a bit, but I will survive.

I found it for sale at the book table during Peter's church's coffee hour, of all places, read the back cover, and before I knew what I was doing, found myself forking over the dinero for this one.    While it's a quick read,  84, Charing Cross Road  chronicles the 20-year friendship between the New Yorkian, British-book-loving Helen Hanff, and Frank Doel, a used-book dealer in London.    Though separated for the duration of their correspondence, they share a love for beautiful books, as Ms. Hanff continually requests rarities from Doel, who (usually!) manages to fulfill both her written and non-written requests.     84, Charing Cross Road --Simply charming!

       	 	 I can almost smell the aroma of glory.  Tonight is my last night of studying.  Tomorrow I will wake up bright and early, drive to school, and take my final exam.  I will also hand in my paper, abstract, return a library book, and attempt to sell back my textbook.  Aahhh... now summer can  really  begin.  And I will have 6 weeks (I think), 6 blessed weeks to read anything I want. Woohoo!  So while the blog's been relatively quiet as of late, good things are in store, most assuredly. Just have to make it through a little more sociolinguistics, and then the actual test.  Cross your fingers for me. 		 		 		 			 urlLink

       	 		 		 POETRY by Pablo Neruda And it was at that age...Poetry arrived in search of me. I don't know, I don't know where it came from, from winter or a river. I don't know how or when, no, they were not voices, they were not words, nor silence, but from a street I was summoned, from the branches of night, abruptly from the others, among violent fires or returning alone, there I was without a face and it touched me.  I did not know what to say, my mouth had no way with names my eyes were blind, and something started in my soul, fever or forgotten wings, and I made my own way, deciphering that fire and I wrote the first faint line, faint, without substance, pure nonsense, pure wisdom of someone who knows nothing, and suddenly I saw the heavens unfastened and open, planets, palpitating planations, shadow perforated, riddled with arrows, fire and flowers, the winding night, the universe.  And I, infinitesmal being, drunk with the great starry void, likeness, image of mystery, I felt myself a pure part of the abyss, I wheeled with the stars, my heart broke free on the open sky. 		 		 		 			 urlLink

       urlLink     Kephart, Beth.  Seeing Past Z .  New York: W.W. Norton, 2004.  Eek!  A week since my last post!  Anyway, this book is great if you fit into any of these categories:  -you're a parent -you like books -you like children -you like reading books to children -you like to imagine -you wish you imagined more -you're a teacher  Kephart discusses so many things in this book; most of the topics center around her son, Jeremy, who by the end of the book turns 14.  At first this worried me; I thought I would have to sit through 240 pages of this mother simply going ga-ga over her kid (that's normal).  After only a chapter, however, I realized that this book was about more than just her son.   Seeing Past Z  is about nurturing the imagination.  It's about what happens when parents don't force their kids to take 10 years of piano lessons or join every sport imaginable, and instead allow them time to stay home and dream and play and create (as I believe little kids do naturally.)  It's about steeping kids in literature, and doing whatever it takes to get them reading and writing.  She only uses her son to illustrate how and why she believes so strongly in imagining.  Kephart also writes about some surprising moments she shares with a reading and writing workshop she leads in the summers for Jeremy and his friends.  What's also exciting about this book is there's an appendix (but that's not all).  In the appendix one finds suggestions on starting your own reading/ writing workshop with kids of various ages.  Very cool.  I loved this book.  I believe in this book.  I deem it Highly Important.  As an English teacher, as a lover of imagining, as a future parent-- this book has been thought-provoking and delightful.  As Anne Shirely once said in  Anne of Green Gables,  "Isn't it splendid to think of all the things there are to find out about? It just makes me feel glad to be alive--it's such an interesting world. It wouldn't be half so interesting if we know all about everything, would it? There'd be no scope for imagination then, would there?"

      Lately, as per the  Dialects in American English  class I'm taking,  I've sought out alternate study areas besides the obvious library and my  own home.  So what do I do?  Hop the first bus to either Borders or  Barnes & Noble.  See, in college I fantasized about studying in some hip  coffee shop or bookstore; but alas, my school is far away from most  things trendy and suburban.   But now as a some-time grad student, I get  to do this.  The experience is not quite as fabulous as it was in my  reveries (what ever is?), but studying in a public place can be very  interesting.  There's something about memorizing the International  Phonetic Alphabet amongst all the books, lattes, and readers makes me  feel like I'm part of something grand, like I'm really  getting something .      I think that's how corporate bookstores like Borders and Barnes & Noble truly want us to feel.  Boy, they've got a good thing going, and they know  it (this concept is addressed in the lovely film  You've Got Mail ,  by the way).  Don't get me wrong, nothing delights me more than seeing all those books in one place, but I can't help but wonder if the CEO of Borders really loves books.  Well, I guess  now  he does, huh?  And furthermore, is that tickly romanticized feeling really worth the near  $20 I've probably spent on tall decaf coffees in the past 3 weeks between  the two stores?  Despite my musings, I've determind that it most likely is.   Barnes & Noble must really love a gal like me.

       A Midsummer Night's Dream  was so fun!  While there are, of course, classic Shakespeare things one could discuss here (like the play within a play, appearance vs. reality, gender roles, etc.), I'd prefer at the moment to list some of my favorite lines, for your reading pleasure.  Enjoy.  :)  "And yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company together nowadays." -Bottom  "Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful." -Titania  (this comes at a hilarious moment)  "When his love he doth espy, Let her shine as gloriously As the Venus of the sky." -Oberon  "Get you gone, you dwarf, You minimus of hindering knotgrass made, You bead, you acorn!" -Lysander  "And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye, Steal me awhile from mine own company." -Helena  "These things seem small and undistinguishable, Like far-off mountains turned into clouds." -Demetrius  "The lunatic, the lover, and the poet are of imagination all compact." -Theseus  "And as imaginatiton bodies forth The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name."  -Theseus  "A good moral, my lord: it is not enough to speak, but to speak true." -Lysander  "If we shadows have offended, Think but this, and all is mended-- That you have but slumbered here While these visions did appear."  -Puck  That'll do for now.  This was truly a beautiful play.

       	 		 		 This is a book I read not for how it was written but for what it said. Forgiveness is the theme.  Scandal is the subject.    The son of Jim and Tammy Faye, the celebrity teleevangelists turned outcasts, Jay Bakker watched his dad thrive at the top and sink to the depths.  In  Son of a Preacher Man , Jay explains how he navigated addiction, denial, loneliness, and humiliation to find freedom in forgiveness.    Weaving his (not surprisingly) anti-religion breed of Christianity throughout his memoir, Jay explains how both his and his parents' mistakes shaped him and led him towards a personal faith.    This is really an excellent book to read.  Again, no literary genius here-- nor does Bakker proclaim to be.  I believe he writes from the heart, sharing his story  while subtly encouraging others to love and forgive.
