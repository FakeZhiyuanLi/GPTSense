        Dear Kyle,                 If you do Infact have a heart, and I hope you do, Please remember to say bye when you sign offline.  I've come to the conclusion, that I just might hate you. Sam, she's a whore, Please don't tell me of the many enconters you've had with her anymore, it make my brain cringe. Things are already confusing in my life, please don't add to the 'suckyness' of it all, Just be here for me.                I really do miss you, contrary to popular belief ((even to me)), and I really do wish that you missed me. I'm not a bad person. Why all of a sudden do I not exsist.                                                Thank you for being my past,                                                         Jamie     That is what a letter would look like, If I had the gut to write one.  Ergh, I am depressed far to much to keep on worrying about him. And also, we are/were friends, There really wasn't a 'relationship' there, for that long anyways. But although just a friendship, a very touching, emotional, and trusting friendship. I have secrets about my entire exsistance that only this 'boy' knows, How can I let go to that? I really need help sorting this out...  I'll write later.

    Kelly, My buddy, My friend, May have to move to Kentucky. Although we haven't been friends for very long, I still love her and am grateful that she's with me.          She Lives with her grandparents and they have been fighting, and the thing is, If they do infact get a divorce, She will have to move to Kentucky. There are the possibilitys that she can live with her mom, or if worst comes to worst, and I hope they don't, She may come live with me ((depending on how open my parents are to that subject, but she's a friend in trouble, and I'm suspecting if they were needed, that they would come in handy)). And if infact that did happen, and I doubt it, She would be open to a whole new world of problems. I really care about Kelly, and know that this really hard on her, So Please, Please, Please, Pray for her, and that things work out alright.

   So, Again, I have been lost in my own thoughts, and here's what I've come up with.        At school ((which is about to start VERY soon)) Everything is just one big soap opera, An unentertaining soap opera at that. And since all summer, I've been somewhat isolated from the series, And Haven't been having withdrawls, I don't want to be in the next season.  So, I've come to the conclusion, To hang back, Learn, Socialize with those who I already know, and Make no attempt to be noticed. And If this doesn't work... well... Then I guess you can consider me an actress, But I don't plan on that.         I have become quite content with my newfound happyness.  It's Great to feel... Great, and quite a posotive change at that.  Jacob, Well, What is there to say. He's not like everyone else, He's Nice, He's cute, He's big enough to defend me, small enough to cuddle ;), What more could a girl ask for? I've got it made.          Well... That's all for now, Next stop, Sleep! yay!

     Yes, I did it, I went camping 4 times this summer ((YAY)).      I went on a camping trip with Chelsea. Well, I don't really consider it camping since there were toliets and a camper, but hey, what can you do? I went Canoeing Yesterday from 1 O'clock to about 4 or 5 o'clock, It was tiering, but fun! Although, I did find out that I, Jamie, Am a very, very, VERY bad canoer ((or however the crap you spell it)) But had fun sucking.     I haven't talked to Jacob for... 3 days. He's supposed to be calling me soon. I Miss him a whole bunch :(. But Man, It's great having a boyfriend... Ya'll should try it.         Well, I'm sleepy and waiting for a phone call, I'll post something more longer next time ((don't make fun of my sentances;) )) Cya'll.

Since I had one of those normal days today, the kind where you just sit there and stare at the computer screen like it's going to do a trick, so I don't have much to write about. I asked Kelly "what should I write about, I'm stoopid and can't think!"  "Your friends, and how wonderful they are ;) "    As Corney as this sounds, I actually think I will, just to introduce ya'll to them.    Kaylee: We've been friends for 4 years. She's the girl that gets ALL the guys, and as you might guess, yes, her chesticals ((boobies)) are bigger than my head ;). Well, that, and she's nice, and purty, and outgoing. She knows Everything about me, and we've fought very few times in the last... Forever. Her mother however, is a prude. She hates me, and I can say the same as my feelings for her, she's thinks I'm some kind of whore ((how offending, eh?)) When I always thought I was a good kid compared to all those other hoebags. ;) Any ways, Kaylee's great, you get the picture.    Kelly: Kelly is... Well, Kelly is alot of things. heh. She's extreamly open, and not shy about herself at all ((well, i'm sure she is a little, but she doesn't appear to be to me)). We havent been friends for very long, two years or so maybe, but that's okay. We've NEVER fought that I can remember, because she normally takes my side ((but as we all know, I'm right all the time anyways ;) )). She really Likes the guys too, and from what I've noticed, the guys like her back. She's real into church, and that's awesome, because now I have a trustworthy referance. And we always have something to talk about. She's really supportive whenever I'm feeling... depressed, and that's alot of the time. So Kelly, I love you... ((hugs)) lol.    Kelsey: Kelsey and I have been friends for about, two years or so ((same as kelly)). She's definitely the HYPER one out of all of us. She's a rebal, and a christian. She has her bumpy times though, but it's always good when she's her hyper outgoing self. She's normally really sympathetic to my problems, and lot's of other people's too. Kelsey has more friends than anyone I've ever known. I can't even get along with a small group of people, let alone the whole 7th and 8th grade. But She's nice, and nice is good. ((moving on...;) ))    Chelsea: Chelsea and I have been friends for, guess? Two years or so, the same as Kelly and Kelsey. She will have fun no matter where she is, be it alone, or with a group of people. She laughs at everything, funny or not, and she's very care free. She, like Kelsey, Has WAY more friends than me, she's definitely a 'People person'. But, I love her anyways.    Jacob: I've Known Jacob since I was... In kindergarden. ((But obviously I know him a little more now ;) )) He's great! He's more of the guy that you couldn't picture in a relationship, and infact, I still can't But apparently it's possible. He seems kind of tough and stuff, and he is I guess, but it doesn't seem that way when your with him 'one on one'. Anyways, I love him, he's great ;) .    Kyle: I know, I know, ya'll might not think the highest of Kyle after my last post, but really he is a great guy. I've Known Kyle for about a year and a half. Kyle Lives in michigan, I live in Ohio... that kinda sucks. But, I Love Kyle like he was my brother ((infact, I have a brother named Kyle, really)) and he knows compleatly EVERYTHING there is to know about me, more than the people I know in person. He's really funny, and Definitely outgoing. He's not like anyone I know, Inside, and appearance wise. I love him, we're just not as close anymore ((as you may have noticed)) but I still love him.    Jami: Yes, I know, He has my name, but how cool is that? I haven't known him that long, But what I do know of him, I like. He's a big geak ;) and That's awesome, he's REALLY into RPG's and stuff, infact, I met him in an RPG chat room. He's really sweet, and a big flirt ((and I know he's reading this right now and blushing)) and he helps me out whenever I'm having problems.     Rachel: Heh, Rachel is my bodygaurd woman ;) but really, she is. I've known Rachel awhile, but never really talked to her or got along with her until this past school year. She's very awesome, her and Kelsey are best friends, or it appears that way. There's not much I can say about her though... she's just.... Rachel, and a very awesome Rachel at that, lol.     That's all I got for ya'll. Like I said, I don't have many friends, I'm not a people person ;). I guess this might come inhandy incase I mention someones name, now you have a little backround check on each of them. Well, cya for now.

A few minutes ago a friend on mine, Jami, asked me "Who where all those poems about? Jacob?"  
I answerd "No, Most of them are about Kyle actually"  
He said " Wow, I wish someone cared about me that much, but hey, what can you do?"  
This Here Kicks my brain clock into super gear and I begin to think: Kyle really doesn't give a shit about me, does he? ((brain answers)) Apparently not, If he did, or does, he doesnt show it very well or at all, in this case. Well brain, you're right, he must not. I wonder if him haveing a girlfriend, and a Job has anything to do with this? Infact when school starts, we'll probobly only talk once a year, instead of once or twice a month. ((Kyle if you read this, i'm sorry, ish)) How can a text based person cause me this much pain and hurt? For all I know, he's a 40 year old perver stalking me. Well, I highly doubt those possibilities, being that I've talked to his girlfriend, but you get my point ((hopefully)).   
So, Jami, I wish someone cared for me that much too... alot.  
More later.. i'm out.

 I'll Know 6.17.04 
  
 When I went to sleep last night, 
 I thought about you, 
 When I woke up this morning, 
 I thought about you, 
 Right now, 
 I'm thinking about you. 
  
  
 When I went to sleep last night, 
 I relized you love her, 
 When I woke up this morning, 
 I missed you, 
 Right now, 
 I wonder if your leaving me? 
  
  
 When I go to sleep tonight, 
 I'll know, 
 That you already have... 
  
  
  
 .................. I can wait forever................. 6.12.2004 
  
  
 I can wait forever to hear your voice, 
 I can wait to touch your face, 
 I can wait for you to love me, 
 I can wait to feel your grace, 
 I can't wait for your attention, 
 I can't wait for your words, 
 We promised eachother we'd always be here, 
 But you've gone without a word, 
 I never saw what you saw in her, 
 I never thought she could take you away, 
 I never thought you'd ever leave, 
 And now what am I to do? 
 I've needed you here through everything, 
 and all I need still is you, 
 And I can't wait forever. 
  
  
 ................I owe......... date unknown 
  
  
 They push me down, 
 You pull me up, 
 So much I feel I owe to you, 
 It's not your job to mend my wounds, 
 But you never seemed to mind, 
 You make me feel wanted, 
 What if we never met? 
 Would everything still be the same? 
  
  
  
 ...............Times............ Date Unknown 
  
  
 The Times change so fast,  
 but here I stay stuck in the past, 
 Trying to pull forward but I've falled so far, 
 There's no where to turn but back, 
 To turn around and face the truth of what evil things have taken my body, 
 Made me who I am now, 
 scared, 
 lonely, 
 and cold. 
  
  
 .........Toll......... 4.30.04 
  
  
 Clense me of the lies, 
 Clense me of the hate, 
 Clense me of this anger, 
 Clense me of this fate, 
 Take away the attitude, 
 Take away the fear, 
 as far as I'm concerned, 
 I shouldn't have to be here. 
 I want to get away , 
 The thought of you ruins me more each day, 
 You scarred my heart, 
 Tattered my soal, 
 Now it's time to pay the Toll.... 
  
  
 .............Abolish me.......... 6.28.04 
  
  
 My mentallity is gone, 
 My spirit free, 
 I've done the unthinkable, 
 I've pulled off the trick, 
 I never thought I would, 
 Never thought I could, 
 I betrayed you, 
 Please hate me, 
 Please hurt me, 
 Please abolish me, 
 Please destroy me, 
 Please tell me you can't forgive me, 
 I don't deserve your compassion, 
 I don't deserve your Love, 
 I don't deserve Justice, 
 And I don't want it, 
 I've done the crime, 
 Don't give me pitty... 


.......Love me......... Date Unknown


I love you,
I miss you,
I want you,
I'm scared of departure,
Afraid of lost fate,
I don't want to mess this up,
But fear it's much to late,
Take me back into your arms,
Back into your life,
Love me now and forever,
Never Leave my side,
Keep your heart with me,
and Love me,
Miss me,
Want me.



Okay... That's all folks, I'm Sure you've enjoyed laughing at my crappy attempt to poetry, but hey, what can you do? ((and if all those words end up without spaces inbetween what i meant to put spaces inbetween, i'm sorry, my computer is gay and keeps messing it up :o )) well there ya are... please comment!

                      And Why again do I allow my dog to sleep with me?      He Snores    He hogs the sheets    He's almost as big as me    He wakes up at 6 o'clock in the morning wanting me to put him outside... when that takes a whole 5 minutes out of my sleep time.    If I don't let him out ((and I normally don't)) He chews up my things...    He burps    He farts...                                 Now for the reasons I let him sleep with me...     He makes me feel safe.                   Don't we think the Bad out weighs the good on this one?¿ I thought so. ((Yawns)) Well good morning anyways ;)

       Hmmm....  
            I'm very amused by this whole Blog thing... being that this is what... my fifth post in one day. I mean the thought that people are going to be able to possibly understand me, being that they will know my thoughts... It's a pretty cool, and somewhat scary feeling, but I guess I obviously like it. I'm Still in the process of figuring out all the stuff that I can put on here.. ((and my bright mind isn't helping me out very well, cause i'm confused as crap!)). Well, I think I'm going to get to figuring out this stuff... ya'll will definitely be hearing from me ;) cya'll

       ............ Kyle, My best friend in the whole world. Kyle who I love, Kyle who I care about, Kyle who I miss. Recently We haven't been talking as much... and it sucks, bad. I love Kyle, and before me and Jacob... I wanted to be with Kyle ((infact I still do, But obviously not as strongly)). But Kyle has a girlfriend now, and I hate her... Her name is Sam. ((short for 'Same' like Same as all those other stupid hoes :) )) He apparently Loves her... or something like that... or so he tells me CONSTANTLY!! Ergh...  
  
 ........... Or so I've said, He's been slowely leaving me... and I miss him, and I still Need him, and now I'm sad ;( . Dont worry you'll here more about this later.. For sure.

       Wow, I could get used to this whole blog thing. Anyways. 
         ((Jacob if you end up reading this, i'm embarassed 'blushes')) I, Jamie, actually have a steady boyfriend, and I like it very much so.   It's weird that I can spend this much time with one person, and not be bored of them, or tierd of doing the same thing over and over again. But then again, this is where trust issues come into play. Being that I've been lied to more than my share by guys, it's hard to be comfortable 'feeling' like this and being in a relationship that's lasted this long. ((5-6 months WOW))   Infact, I'm confused to the point of a headache what I should make of this... I enjoy him, and being around him, alot, and that scares me... cause I don't want to get to attatched and then end up alone, again. But I also don't want to let go of a good thing.  So Yesterday during a conversation with a stranger , ;) , I somewhat figured out my game plan... 
   
 He says: So, How's life treating you? 
 I say: Awesome, for now. And that's a change, and I'm loving it, YAY. 
 He says: What's so wonderful? 
 I say: A boy... But I know I'm going to end up getting my heart broken anyways, so I can't get TOO attatched. 
 He says: Well then, if you know that, then why do you even get with him? 
 I say: Because, It's going good for the time being, It makes me happy, It makes him happy, Happy is good no matter how long it's going to last. And happy is definitely a change for me. 
 He says:Yeah good point. Happy is good. Considering that it's unusual. 
  
         I thought that summed it up pretty good... and it makes alot of sense too... so all is good in Jamieland. And I love it...

Well I guess ya'll should know a little bit about me so... here you go.
