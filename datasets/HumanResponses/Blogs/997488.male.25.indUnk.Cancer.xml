      baltimore is rainy today, but not too cold. the leaves have all turned red, so it's really beautiful, especially on my street. i love rain. if i took a photograph of my street right now, it'd be almost like a postcard, with old colorful houses, cobblestone road, shiny drenched ground, and red and yellow leaves everywhere. and no one would probably guess it's baltimore (except for the rowhouses, which would be a dead giveaway), the crime/homocide/drug/poverty capital of america. it's like paul simon's kodachrome song, "makes you think all the world's a sunny day." poor balto; it can actually be quite lovely. amazing what we've done to this city, and much of the world. mankind's impact on the earth and itself boggles the mind. we've just finished the week-long human behavior course. one of the lectures was on drug abuse and addiction, in which we had to read an excerpt from "the corner," a rather famous piece about drug in baltimore. after that lecture i went home and watched traffic (courtesy of jon lee...still). it absolutely appalls me the magnitude of the drug problem and the depth to which it is injuring and murdering our people and society. yet isn't it all done to us by ourselves? from the movie, which was heralded as a not-so-unrealistic portrait, it paints an overwhelming picture of the drug problem in america. it was almost disheartening and discouraging. but there're lots that can and needs to be done. check this out: www.drugfreeamerica.com  on a lighter note, here're some great new from the world of formula one racing. jaguar team has secured two new drivers, although the rationale for bumping eddie irvine off the team is bizzare, borderlining stupid. (hopefully there are some good reasons behind it, 'cuz irvine has done respectably well for jaguar.) the r4 (next year's car) will be unveiled on january 13, 2003. best of luck to one of my favorite team. and jordan is jumping on the ford wagon, becoming another ford cosworth-powered team. yeah! i've always liked the jordan team. and team arrows will be amongst the entry next year, as it has been taken over the a german company. it's a bit of a disappointment, though, 'cuz i thought it was going to be taken over by the americans, reportedly dan gurney. arrows has always had real nice-looking cars. as for cart, it's quite a pity that so many famous teams ditched it for irl next year. in my opinion, cart is much more exciting than irl, what with its international stint, road and street courses, and big-time players that occassionaly jump over to formula and become stars. seems to me irl is somewhat of a nascar with open-wheeled racing machines; oval tracks are just not that exciting.

      wow, haven't written for a while. but since no one is reading anyway, what does it matter??? i wonder if sung reads me stuff. sung, if you're reading this, you get a prize from me.  anyway, 3 more weeks until winter break; i can't wait. last night went to an NU alum meeting in DC. i guess i'm gonna be interviewing high school kids applying to NU, how exciting! DC is so nice, such a cool town. i love it. the drive there was kinda scary, though, no light or nothing on balto-wash pkwy. no billboards, either, which i guess was the point. i wish baltimore is as nice and cool as DC.  everyday i want a mazda RX-8 more and more! but i want to keep connie, too. if i win the lottery, i would save 35 grand of that and buy an RX-8 in the summer. i want either a yellow or blue one, 6-speed manual, loaded, and then i'll paint the wheels flat black, lower it, put in HID lights, and turbocharge it. i've rekindled my love for japanese cars...  took an exam yesterday; molecular and cell crap. i hate exams, they just come and go and make me feel violated and insulted. now i'm waiting for the clock to strike 3 to meet w/ someone to work on my clinical conference stuff. i'm so bored; i definitely need more things and people going on in my life. i miss ken my old roommate and that old antique apartment in evanston. that was so much fun. i miss evanston a great deal, though i heard it's getting snowy and cold there, much worse than here. i really miss evanston a lot, the water, the stores, the eats, the beach (even though they're fake), the yacht club and all. i don't think i really want to go back there and live, though. i miss my time there, but it wouldn't be the same if i went back there and lived and worked there now; it'd be like going back to an empty house that you grew up in. think i'll visit chicago in spring break...  i want an RX-8...

      went to a comedy club a couple nights ago in hollywood. it was 4 hours long! it was pretty funny, but for the most part it was quite vulgar and crude, definitely rated r. except for a few of them, it wasn't really that classy, which is kinda sad.

      i didn't do ANY studying today...yet. this morning i woke up from a glorious night of sleep, not really remembering what i did last night... i vaguely remember now. i drew a very nice picture of a 1987 iroc-z, listened to music, listened to the really strange radio show on 98 rock (it was sausage night), read this and that books (leisurely books, leisure rules!), and somehow ended up in my bed and fell asleep. now i remember, i left the radio on and sometime during the night i shut it down. at 928 i woke up to the sound of splashy rain and a semi-dark sky, just the way i like it. good thing the temperature wasn't that high, otherwise the glaciers on the street would'ved led to a flood. it was a beautiful day; i love rainy days. my room was a mess, but i didn't mind. in fact, i liked it; i liked it kinda messy. when things are messy (as opposed to everything at right angles to each other), there is a cozier and lively sense of being and of life. my car is more comfortable when there's my stuff over the seats and the floor. my room feels more real and lovely when there's stuff lying around on the floor and over the desks. anyway, back to my morning. i proceeded to make things messier by digging through my closet and under my bed in search of my ethernet cables, after not finding them in my computer box in the basement. i proceeded to make things very messy. i proceeded to make things very very messy. imagine you had a tub full of lego pieces (i used to) and you toppled over that tub so all the pieces are ALL over your floor (i used to do that, too). it's amazing how much stuff (or junk) we accumulate. i still have a bunch of clothes here that i will probably never wear, though not as much as i have at home. i have this office deopt box full of research papers that i've accumulated over the past 3 years, probably about a third i've read and the rest i never will. i've miscellaneous papers, notes, under my bed, that i can't really throw away but i don't really need. and then there's the instruction manuals for my calculators, mcat books, maps, those AAA travel guides, boxes for my nokia, boxes of kleenex that fit into connie's center counsole, and the long slender box for my bedframe. and then there's more junk. i'm worred about what to do with some of this stuff now. geez. anyway, after demolishing my room, i went downstairs to accuse my roommate for stealing my ethernet cable, only to find out i was wrong. i came back up and further made a war ground of my flat. and then i left the house into the rain to get my ethernet cables so i can get on the internet (yes i finally wised up). there was MAD rain in balto today. haven's seen rain like this in months. it was glorious. i love driving in the rain, too. i drove to wal mart and sam's club, and neither had longe enough cables. i was half grumbling and half glad, 'cuz now i had an excuse to get out of the city. so i hopped onto the balto-washington parkway, which was pretty flooded with water and fun. it was really coming down then, and it was really fun driving through it. at the end, i spent 50 frigging dollars on these stupid network cables. they probably cost the company 50 cents to make. too bad the rain let down; it stopped in the afternoon. it melted a lot of snow outside. there's no longer enough snow to crush down the roof over me as to twist my door frame (i knew 'cuz my door didn't close properly for the past few days). i don't know why i like rain so much. i guess when it's raining, there's more going on. there's infinite drops of rain traveling from the sky down, hitting the ground, making a nice smell and nice noises, washing everything, and making people either smile (me) or curse (you). it's something to stimulates reactions and creates a mess, in good ways (or in bad ways if you don't like rain). i guess it's kinda like a messy room. or it may just be 'cuz we don't get much rain in soCal

      chef dave continues to experiment with the dangeroulsy unknown. tonight i tried to make this white cheese sauce for my penne pasta. i put tunafish, milk, margarine, and spicy monterey jack cheese in the frying pan, and the result looked kinda scary. imagine cereal but instead of raisin bran it's canned tuna and cheese. immediately a voice on my shoulder said to me "cornstarch will save this!" so i borrowed some cornstarch from one of my roommates. and the result looked kinda scary. imagine grits but instead of the white whatever it was tunafish with peppered cheese. immediately a voice on my shoulder became silent. but it turned out better, much better, and now i'm eating it.

      wednesday i went skiing for the first time, up at ski liberty in pennsylvania, w/ mark and his friend. it was SO much fun! i only skied down the bunny hills, 'cuz duh i can't ski. the first run down was pretty miserable. mark helped me down, although i fell so many times quite miserably, i felt pretty stupid. and this dumb kid laughed at me, too. i should've screamed his ass out or something...kids can be such asses. but after that first embarassing run it became much easier. it helped that there was a lot of snow and it was all really soft to fall on. it really was a lot of fun, i can't believe i've never gone skiing until now. it's not like i skied well, but i think i learned the bare basics pretty fast... it really wasn't that hard. like most other things, you have to approach it as if you already kinda knew how to do it, kinda like faking it with confidence. i need to go again real soon...

      i realized that i daydream a lot. it's fun. i was REALLY upset today that i had to come to school... today during the first lecture on neurotrophism, i got lost about half way and started daydreaming about my future car list, and wrote it down on my notebook, along with an IROC-Z logo. here it is: 1. 1987 chevy camaro IROC-Z, 5.7l, 5-speed, t-top, yellow 2. 1989 chevy corvette z51, 6-speed, competition yellow, black interior 3. 1993 mazda rx-7 r1, competition yellow 4. 1994 nissan 300zx twin turbo, 2 seater, t-top, yellow half of them are chevys, yeah. chevy used to make such cool cars. chevy thunder was the heartbeat of yesterday's america... nowadays they make mostly sad and boring cars  and then during the second lecture on neurocytology ii, i daydreamed about the dvds that i want to buy. here they are: 1. breakfast club 2. ferris bueller's day off 3. better off dead 4. goonies 5. back to the future 6. speed zone

      so all these memories prompted me to think back further. last thursday i got bored and sick of my boring life, so i went to blockbuster's and rented terminator 2, a very exciting movie. (after watching it my life was still pretty not exciting) that was a 90s movie. i rarely watch 90s movies nowadays, 'cuz they're not old enough yet to be classics; in a few years. it reminds me of the time when i was growing up and all that. terminator 2 was such a cool movie. i don't know how they're going to top a shape-shifting terminator in the new one. oh ok i get it, with a woman terminator. ... it was a very nostalgic movie, really. it was all what the 90s looked like, the music, the way movies looked and felt, the streets of california, the cars, the way people looked, and all that. makes me so nostalgic, both of the time and home. i think i'm more of a 90's child than 80's child (and definitely a californian trapped on the east coast), and now i miss the 80s and 90s a lot. here i list some of the very coolest things that went on when i was growing up then: 1. atari and nintendo, sega genesis, later on, super nintendo! 2. nissan 300zx, toyota mr2, camaro iroc-z, firebird, c4 corvette, honda crx, prelude, and BA's van 3. ghostbusters, batman, ninja turtles, gi joe, and mask 4. arnold schwartzneggar, total recall, terminator, twins, kindergarten cop 5. honey i shrunk the kids, back to the future, goonies! 6. michael jackson (!), mc hammer, prince, van halen 7. the a-team, knight rider, macgyver, alf, magnum pi 8. america's funniest home videos, cosby show, who's the boss, wonder years, growing pains (this goes on and on) 9. sleep over with my cousins 10. renting friday the 13th movies, watching w/ my cousins, our eyes half-closed through most it 11. domino's pizza, because it's what ninja turtles ate 12. lego (this is before they put all to funny faces on lego figures) 13. sesame street 14. movies with john candy and eugene levy (favorite: speed zone) 15. the simpsons, wings, home improvement, saved by the bell, unsolved mysteries 16. reebok pump 17. microwave oven, the magic food box! 18. crystal pepsi (right now!) ...  wow this list goes on and on. there sure are a lot to be missed, but now lost forever... like those old lego catalogs, atari games, my old pump shoes, bottles of crystal pepsi, and time spend playing with my cousins and friends. (incidentally i still have my original nintendo, the realy boxy one, stashed way in my garage somewhere) one thing i can salvage: cars. hmm... i'm gonna start buying up them used sports cars from then that were real cool and real expensive, now they're cheap.   being grown up isn't half as much fun as growing up

      geez, suddenly i feel so old. peach just got engaged, and someone else i knew already got married. and then i think about it, i'm 23 years old! what makes it weird is that i still feel like how i felt many many years ago. 16 feels like just then, but it's like 7 years ago?! how weird. 7 years ago, i was in high school back home in california. my neighborhood had peacocks prancing all over the streets, like that? our house had a big heavy wooden gate next to the garage which leads to where the garbage cans were along with other assorted junks and a tool shed. i used to be scared of getting locked in the tool shed 'cuz it's hot and had spiders in it. in front of the garage is a very steep driveway, 'cuz our house sat a bit higher from the street on the hugo reid side. it was a corner house. the other side actually sat lower. the neighborhood was hilly. when i was 16 i took my driving lesson. my instructor was this hispanic dude named art pena who showed up in a crappy corolla with two sets of pedals. "there's another guy at your high school living around here taking my lesson, name's buckmaster," art pena said. "buckmaster? what a stupid name," i said. it was a pretty funny name. at my 3rd and last lesson he pointed to a woman when we drove down colorado bulevard and said she was a prostitute. as i slowed down and pulled over (as instructed by art pena), he suddenly told me to keep driving and not stop. "it's an undercover cop," art said. "oh yeah? how'd you know?" i asked. "'cuz i've got cops in the family." hmm, right. when i was 16 and a half i brave-heartedly made an appointment at the pasadena dmv on rosemead blvd for a road test. twice the stupid dmv testers failed me, but i nailed them down on my 3rd and last attempt and got my driver's license. my only regrets are that i acted too nicely to those dmv bureaucrat narcs and i gave a dumb smile when i took my picture. that picture haunts me for many years. that was the year 1995. or was it 96?

      today after church everyone went to have lunch at a 4th year emily's house nearby. she made us vegetarian chili; it was so good. i think i'll look up some chili recipes. we stayed there for a while and chatted until around 3. it was really fun. mike, mo, eric, janelle, and darling were there. emily's roommate was in peace corps in mangolia, and she told us some stuff about it. peace corps sounds really cool, and i'm kinda interested. afterwards darling and i went to the goodwill store and i bought a $20 tv. i looked on the back, and it said it was manufactured october 1983. sweet. it had really good reception on fox when it was in the store, and that's the most important thing, 'cuz fox has all the best shows. but when i brought it home up to my penthouse on the 3rd floor, it didn't get as good a reception on fox =( but i guess at least it has the sound, and that's half of it. i also got goya mexican rice and 2 boxes of corn bread mix (25 cents a box!). i miss LA so much...

      hmph...  i couldn't think of anything to write. blogs are stupid.  so i'll describe my dream house. my dream house is actually not a house, but more of a loft/garage. it'd be kinda like a small office/warehouse building in a nice industrial park kind of town, like parts of irvine. it'd be about 1.5 stories tall, with the square footage of a medium-sized house. there'd be, of course, a decent sized parking area and grass around the house, 'cuz it'd originally be an office buidling. the inside would be real phat. i'd take out all the walls save all the weight bearing structures, and convert the inside into a giant garage/showroom/workshop space. it'd have to be big enough for cars to drive around in. there'd be a reeling garage door at the side not facing the street. i'd install a basic lift, a nice tool bench at one end of the house, and all the stuff for a basic garage so i can work on my car inside. at the other end would be the living area. the kitchen, dining room, living room, a small library/den/lounge, and all that are all exposed and opened up to the rest of the house/garage. there'd be a loft for my bedroom, probably over the living area instead of the cars, with a cool staircase up it. there'd be a few skylights, too. basically, take your typical lab-like track race shop, blow it up to the size of a house, add all the stuff one needs to live in, and there it is. i figure a set up like this wouldn't cost more than a regular house. it'd just be highly unusual. it'd be really avant garde, too. one day...  and here's the list dream garage cars: -rx-8 (fe17) -85-92 camaro (especially iroc-z) -fd3s rx-7 -90-94 300zx tt (z32) -84-89 corvette coupe (c4) -93-02 camaro (96 on, ss) -94-95 mr2 turbo -82-89 firebird trans am -57 nomad -63-67 corvette sting ray (c2) -corvette zr1 (c4) -a real souped up atenza -03 svt cobra convertible -69-70 shelby gt500 -2nd gen crx -3rd and 4th gen prelude -gmc typhoon -series I jag e-type -saleen s351 speedster -series II elise -nsx -r34 skyline gt-r v-spec II -fiero -f355 gts -65 malibu ss z16 (rare!) -64-69 gto -k5 blazer/original gmc jimmy -jeep wagoneer -03 mustang gt convertible  geez, that's a long list. but it's only a dream list. and most of it would be used cars, some of them very used. that's what my place will be for. one day...

      here's a history of arcadia, ca, my hometown  Arcadia - Yesterday and Today by Christine Van Maanen, City Clerk of Arcadia, 1956 - 1988.   The City of Arcadia spreads over the land that was once part of an enormous land grant given to the San Gabriel Mission in 1771 by the King of Spain. Spanish rule gave way to Mexican rule in 1822, after the Republic of Mexico declared its independence from Spain. Much of the vast acreage belonging to the Mission became public land of the Mexican Republic. In 1829, Hugo Reid, a Scot who became a Mexican citizen, petitioned for the Rancho Santa Anita, a tract of over 13,000 acres extending north from San Gabriel to the Sierra Madre mountain range. In 1845 he was granted full title from the last Mexican governor, Pio Pico. As a result of the Mexican War and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, California was transferred to the United States.  In the next thirty years the Rancho Santa Anita changed ownership five times, until finally, in 1875, Elias J. "Lucky" Baldwin, rich from his goldmine investments, purchased approximately 8,000 acres for $200,000. The passenger rate war between the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific Railroads brought hordes of land-seekers. Baldwin had no trouble disposing of some of his vast holdings, keeping for himself the homestead and ranch, the land west of Santa Anita Avenue. Lucky Baldwin helped plan Santa Anita Tract which was to become Arcadia.  Because the Baldwin ranch and business for pleasure-seeking visitors were its only industries, Arcadia did not hold its election for incorporation until 1903. Baldwin was elected its firs Mayor, and the first Board of Trustees meeting was held in the famed Oakwood Hotel on August 17, 1903. In order to acquire some quick money for the City treasury, one of the first ordinances of the many adopted called for $40.00 liquor license tax to be exacted from the numerous saloons. The much-needed establishment of law and order was furthered by a marshal, deputies, a City Court, and a jail.  In 1904 the opening of the original Santa Anita Race Track - site of the present Arcadia County Park - was the fulfillment of one of Baldwin's dreams. That year Arcadia's first grammar school was built at First Avenue and California Street. With a reform city government holding sway, the character of the town changed. A fire department was established, and streets were lighted, graded, and oiled. The steady increase in population from 1910 to 1920 demanded new and expanding city services such as water, postal service, and street paving.  The World War I era saw the original Santa Anita Race Track become Ross Field, site of an Army balloon school. John H. Hoeppel, who served in the U.S. Army at the school and later became the Congressman from the area, was instrumental in having this Army land transferred to Los Angeles County in 1933. His original plan was to have the land developed as a municipal park. He was unable to interest the City at that time so he approached the County wit the idea and was able to help convince General Douglas MacArthur, then Army Chief of Staff, to approve the transfer of 183 acres of the Ross Field Balloon School to the County without cost for the development of the park.  The 1920's witnessed a period of rapid development as large tracts became home sites with popular acre-sized lots. At that time Arcadia was known as a chicken-raising community. Business failures and unemployment were signs of the times as Arcadia experienced the depression of the 1930's. A period of political turmoil and demand for economy in municipal affairs ensued. Despite these conditions, in 1934 the present Santa Anita Race Track, located on approximately 400 acres of the original ranch, was opened to the public. During World War II it was used as a Japanese Assembly Center and later was converted into an Army Ordinance Center.  It is also interesting to note that during Lucky Baldwin's time the race track area was used for Baldwin's winery.  Dedication of the Arcadia County Park in 1937 culminated years of hard work by the County of Los Angeles and the WPA (Works Progress Administration) in converting Ross Field into a recreation facility. Completion of the swimming pool, tennis courts, golf course, bowling greens, picnic tables, and other facilities in subsequent years affords Arcadians and others a center for leisure. Continuing efforts to supply recreation areas and open spaces throughout Arcadia have led to the development of Wilderness Park, housing the John Panatier Nature Center at the mountainous northern section of the city, and several "mini" parks closer in.  The largest Arcadia subdivision transaction in history occurred in 1936 when approximately 1,300 acres of the remaining Baldwin Ranch were sold by its heirs to Rancho Santa Anita, Inc., represented by Harry Chandler, publisher of the Los Angeles Times newspaper. During the following years this land was developed into several residential districts by various builders.  The Los Angeles State and County Arboretum was established in 1947 when eleven acres of Rancho Santa Anita, including the historic home site and buildings, were purchased for $320,000 by the State of California and Los Angeles County. Operated by the California Arboretum Foundation, it serves as a horticultural and botanical center which is open to the public. Classes in horticulture and botanical center which is open to the public. Classes in horticulture and botany are held for children and adults. Historical landmarks, including the Victorian Queen Anne cottage, built in 1879, furnished with antiques from the late 1800's, the stable, rose garden, and the adobe cabin of Hugo Reid (Arcadia's first settler) have been restored. In 1970 the old brick Santa Anita Depot was carefully removed from its Colorado Boulevard trackside location, and to assure its preservation, restored at the southern portion of the Arboretum grounds. Many motion pictures, including TARZAN, JUNGLE JI8M, DANIEL BOONE, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, ROAD TO SINGAPORE, LASSIE, and many others, as well as numerous TV segments, were filmed in part in that location, utilizing the jungle-type background and spring-fed lake. Segments of the LOVE BOAT series were also filmed here.  The mushrooming growth of the Los Angeles area during the postwar period did not bypass Arcadia, some thirteen miles east-northeast of the city of Los Angeles. The population in 1904 was 360, and the total assessed valuation of taxable Arcadia property in 1904- 1905 was $360,405. The population in 1980 was 46,850, and the assessed valuation for 1970-1980 was $295,225,250. Although Arcadia has grown rapidly in population, it is primarily a residential city with a large percentage of its citizens employed outside the corporate limits. A number of small businesses are located in shopping areas scattered throughout the city. Because of the limited area zoned for light industry, there are no sizeable industrial plants. An industrial area in the southeast corner of the city continues to develop with the encouragement of city officials. Formation of the Community Redevelopment Agency in December of 1968 has exerted significant influence on the orderly expansion and improvement of the city. In 1972 voters approved the Fashion Park shopping complex proposed by the Santa Anita Race Track, to be built on seventy acres of its Huntington Drive property. Santa Anita Fashion Park, containing some 144 stores in 1974, established Arcadia as a regional shopping center. In 1984 a new hotel, the Granada Royale, now the Embassy Suites, at the northeast corner of Second Avenue and Huntington Drive, was completed. A new medical office building is on Race Track property wit an enclosed pedestrian bridge over Huntington Drive to the Methodist Hospital. We also have a new Red Cross building located on the Methodist Hospital grounds. Currently under construction is the Arcadia Gateway Centre located on the south side of Huntington Drive between Second and Fifth Avenues. This is a retail complex - including several fine restaurants. There is also under construction a new office building on the northwest corner of First Avenue and Huntington Drive. Huntington Drive is ever changing.  So - This is how we grew.

      last night i decided to rent a video. warehouse doesn't have 99-cent rentals anymore, that's really annoying. i didn't really know what i wanted to see, so i lingered at the video store for a while. it came down to master and commander, akira, starsky and hutch, or the last emperor. i really wanted to get more than one, but i got only the last emperor. i had seen it w/ my parents when it first came out. i was like eight at the time, and i remember watching the first scene and waking up when the movie's over. anyhoo, the dvd is three and a half hours long! but it really was very good. it's incredible. i hope it's pretty accurate, i think it is. chinese history is so fascinating, and so sad. the story was really intriguing, but it was soooo sad. but now i want to go to china that much more. i'm really into my roots thing now. pu yi, that's the last emperor's name, actually wrote an autobiography. i want to read that. and his tutor, this scottish guy, also wrote a book about it, and i want to read that, too. the movie is filled with so many poignant moments, one of them is the depiction of china after pu yi was released from the communist prison, when he went out and saw the people and all that. people were so poor, and there was this parade that was just ridiculous. communism really screwed over the chinese people. it's so sad. anyway, i watched the whole thing last night and didn't doze off this time. this is something that i wouldn't've been able to appreciate when i was younger

      watched the bourne supremacy yesterday at pacific hasting's 60-foot screen. i was at the library for a while, just couldn't study, was in a real real bad mood, and felt like crap, so decided to go and escape myself. half way into the movie i felt sick to my stomach. it was like someone hand-held the camera thruout the whole movie, it was ridiculous. i once mounted a camcorder to my r/c truck and produced the same nauseating effect. when i came out, i felt like i could throw up

      i've come back to blogs  fire truck. my life sucks at this moment. ever wish you were somebody else? i don't think i wish that. i just wish people in my life now were better people, and good people in my life then whom i loved had never left. life can be such a bitch. when you're dealt a rotten card and it's not a game, words cannot describe how much that sucks. harmony is a wonderful thing that i always took for granted, though come to think of it, there hasn't really been too much harmony in my life since mom died. now i feel even worse, 'cuz i know there are countless people out there who have it worse than me. more than ever, i wish my life was a movie...'cuz then something ridiculous can happen but more than likely there'll be some kind of decent happy ending. i'm experiencing a mid-20's crisis right now. somebody rescue me
