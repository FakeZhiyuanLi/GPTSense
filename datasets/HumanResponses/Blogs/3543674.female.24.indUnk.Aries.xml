      It has officially happened...I am old.  I'm not sure when it happened, or how, but it did.  I am referring to the fact that I played two games of softball last night and now I am so sore I can barely type this.  That might be a slight exaggeration, but I am sore nonetheless.  It's not like I even played a real strenuous game, but I guess I still used some muscles that weren't used to being used.  It was fun though.  I have always loved playing sports of any kind so it was nice to get to go play.    Not much else is happening around here.  We went shopping this weekend for more clothes for Braxton.  We got him some cute little outfits so he should be set for the rest of the summer until it starts turning cool.  We had a real nice time shopping.  My mom kept Braxton so Mike and I just took our time and went in any store we wanted to and went to a Mexican restaurant for dinner.  It was a really nice time.    Guess that's all for now, later.

      Today was Mike's first Father's Day.  I hope he enjoyed it.  Braxton and I tried to make it a special day for him.  We got him a Phillies jersey for his present and a special card from Braxton and one from me.  I took of a picture of them both sleeping this morning in the bed together.  It was so cute.  Braxton loves sleeping in our bed because we have a fan in the room.  The fan is magical in his eyes, because it makes him go to sleep usually fairly quickly.  They looked adorable lying side by side, with Braxton's arms up over his head (his favorite sleep position).    I can't really say enough about how wonderful of a father Mike is to Braxton.  There's nothing he won't do for him.  He is totally in love with Braxton and in awe of everything he does.  He is also a very affectionate and loving father, which I love.  Nothing is sweeter than seeing a man kiss and love on a baby.  And when it's your baby and your husband, it's even sweeter.  Braxton and I are extremely lucky to have such a wonderful father and husband.  Happy Father's Day!

      I think I have finally recovered with my bout with the flu/allergy problem.  About this time last night, I didn't think I was going to make it.  I went to the doctor yesterday and he said my throat was red, had some sort of sinus infection and allergy problems.  He gave me two prescriptions.  Amazing what a difference those antibiotics make.  I still didn't sleep very well, but I sleep better than I had the nights before, so that was an improvement.    Mike was so wonderful to me while I was sick.  He stayed home from work to take care of Braxton and do everything for me.  He is a great caregiver, much better than I am.  He is just so patient and loving when I am sick. I think Braxton was glad he was home too.  He just smiled and laughed at Mike all day.  Mike can get him to laugh much better than I can.  He can do the silliest things and Braxton just laughs and laughs at him.  Braxton has the absolute cutest laugh I have ever heard.  You can't hear his laugh and not break out in a smile yourself.  He is so incredibly wonderful.     That's all for now...later sweet tater. I

      Today is Mike and I's 2nd anniversary.  In some ways it seems like we've been married a lot longer than that, but in other ways it seems like only yesterday.  Our wedding weekend was such a wonderful time with both of our families together.  It was one of the best weekends of my life.    On a lower note, I've been sick for the last two days.  Not really sure what the problem is, but I seem to have a combination of flu/cold.  I can't sleep at night, then I'm exhausted all day.  Oh well, what can you do?  My mom came and got Braxton for a few hours yesterday to give me a little resting time, but all I did was sit and wonder if he was doing ok.  I must have called my mom about 10 times in that short amount of time.  Pathetic, I know.  That's about all for tonight...later.

      It's only 8:47 p.m. and I'm already contemplating going to bed...how sad is that.  I feel like today has been a really long and hectic day, although we really haven't done much.  We went shopping for clothes for Braxton.   His clothes he has now fit him, but are getting more snug every day.  He's such a big boy.  Although, it doesn't take much of an excuse for me to go shopping for him though, I absolutely love buying him new clothes.  He just looks so darn cute in everything.    Today is my sister and brother-in-law's 5th wedding anniversary.  Seems like they have been married much longer than that.  I can't hardly imagine a time when Jeremy wasn't in our family.   But then again sometimes it seems like my sister is still 16 years old and I'm 13.  That was a long time ago.  I'm beginning to really understand what people have always meant by the fact that time flies.  Sometimes I think I can't wait for Braxton to get bigger so he can do this and that, but then I get sad thinking about how much he has already changed in three months and how fast he is growing up.  I am trying to cherish every moment with him and not wish this time away.    Well, I've made it to 8:52 p.m...time for bed.

      Braxton and I were on our own last night as Mike was out of town overnight for business.  I take for granted how much Mike helps me with Braxton at night and so when I'm by myself, everything is so hard to do.  It's the little things that are hard to do, like take the dog outside.  If I leave Braxton in the house while I take Chloe out, he cries the whole time, but it's hard to get the leash on while I am holding him.  Anyways, it's just kinda hard to do while I'm here alone.    I decided to let Braxton sleep in the bed with me all night.  He usually sleeps in the bed with us for a few hours in the mornings, but never the whole night.  I know people say it's a bad habit to get into, but I love him being in the bed with me.  I love being able to look at him during the night and know he is ok.  The only bad part is he is a squirmer.  He squirms all over that bed and somehow kept ending up with his feet in my back kicking away.  That's alright though, I still loved it.  That's all for now...think I'll hit the sack early tonight.

      Last night Braxton went to his first wedding.  The wedding started at 6:00 p.m.  We got there at around 5:15 to make sure we had a seat.  It was a struggle to keep him content but he did really good until about the time Brooke and Scotty started exchanging their vows.  Then he had had enough. Out come one of his girly screams. But he really didn't do so bad considering how long we had been there, but he still had to leave the ceremony nonetheless.    It was so great getting to see some of my friends I haven't seen in a while and letting them see Braxton.  I am so proud of him and love taking advantage of every opportunity to show him off.  He looked adorable in his carpenter jeans, polo shirt and shoes.  He was such a little stud.    Mike has spent so much time redesigning the site, it really looks great.  I just love it.    That's all for now....later sweet tater.

      Braxton had a physical therapy evaluation yesterday.&nbsp; He has trouble holding his head up when he is flat on his stomach so his doctor suggested we get an evaluation just to check to make sure he is developing on track.&nbsp;&nbsp; The evaluation went well, the physical therapist thought he might be a little behind on holding his head up when flat on his stomach, but he was well ahead on other areas.&nbsp; So she said at the most, a physical therapist would come once a week for a month to just check and see how he was doing.&nbsp; The physical therapist went on and on about how cute Braxton was and how he was definitely going to break a lot of hearts one day.&nbsp; I have heard that from many people.&nbsp; I'm not looking forward those days.&nbsp;   Not much else has been happening.&nbsp; Pretty uneventful week so far.&nbsp; I did buy my first Christmas present this week, so I'm off to a good start.&nbsp; Braxton gets his second round of immunization tomorrow, which I dread.&nbsp; I make Mike go with me and he stays in the room with Braxton while he gets the shots.&nbsp; I take the easy way out and wait in the waiting area for it to be done.&nbsp; I can't stand to see Braxton in pain.&nbsp; Although I know that the shots don't hurt for very long, I just figure that staying in the room can be one of Mike's jobs.&nbsp;   About time to start the routine of getting Braxton and myself ready for work....later.

      Another weekend is almost over, seems like they are over so quickly.&nbsp; I wonder who ever thought up the idea of working 5 days and only being off 2 days?&nbsp; 4 days of working to 3 being off would be a much more favorable ratio in my opinion.&nbsp; But then again so would 0 days of working to 7 days being.&nbsp; Guess I don't have a real good business mind though.&nbsp;   Yesterday I went down to play with Connor outside in his little blow up pool.&nbsp; He's at such a fun age to play with.&nbsp; He's very easily entertained and is so happy to have you do anything with him.&nbsp; I was going to put Braxton in the water, but he was much more content sitting in the air conditioned house watching a video.&nbsp; He is so spoiled to the air conditioner (even worse than I am).&nbsp; It's&nbsp; kinda weird to play with Connor and know that in no time at all, Braxton will be that big and I'll be doing the same things with him.&nbsp;   Guess we'll go to church this morning.&nbsp; Braxton usually makes it about 5 minutes into the sermon and then he starts screaming so Mike has to take him out.&nbsp; But we keep taking him because we want him to grow up going to church.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not too bad though, because our church has television monitors out in the lobby, so Mike can sit out there with Braxton and still hear what the preaching is saying.&nbsp;   Time to go wake up the lazy&nbsp;boys around here.&nbsp; Later.

      Not too much has been happening this week, which is not a bad thing at all.&nbsp; Sometimes I like weeks like this where we don't have anything we have to do.&nbsp; I did play softball again Tuesday night.&nbsp; Mike and Braxton came.&nbsp; I take every opportunity I can to show Braxton off to people.&nbsp; He is just so adorable!&nbsp; My mom, Jess, Jeremy, Connor and Carson came too.&nbsp; Connor had been wanting to see his "Ta Ta" play ball.&nbsp; He was amazed that I could hit the ball.&nbsp; He told me today he wants to go back and watch me play again next week.&nbsp; He's&nbsp;such a cutie.&nbsp;   It is so hot here that it makes going anywhere miserable.&nbsp; Today is was 96 degrees.&nbsp; I had to go run some errands this afternoon and each time we had to get in the car, Braxton would scream and cry because it is so hot in the car.&nbsp; And because his carseat is rear facing, it takes even longer for him to be able to feel any coolness at all.&nbsp; It breaks my heart to hear him crying so hard and there is nothing I can do to make him feel better.&nbsp;   We don't have any big plans for the weekend, probably just chill out around the house and try to stay cool.&nbsp; When it's this hot, I don't care anything about going to too many places.&nbsp; The heat makes me grouchy.&nbsp; Mike would probably say a lot of things make me grouchy, but he exaggerates.&nbsp;   Until next time....later.

      Today is Connor's 3rd birthday.&nbsp; I can't believe how fast he is growing up.&nbsp; Seems like only yesterday I was in the delivery room when he was born.&nbsp; He is such a precious little boy.&nbsp; From the time he was born, I have always loved him and treated him like he was my own.&nbsp; I think I will always have a very special bond with him.&nbsp; He calls me his "Ta Ta" and I absolutely love it.&nbsp; I look at him and know that it will literally be no time at all that Braxton is going to be that age.&nbsp; I really look forward to when Braxton is walking and talking, but then again I don't want him to grow up any faster than he already is.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Connor's birthday party was at Chuck E. Cheese's.&nbsp; The only way to describe it was wild.&nbsp; He had a great time though and got every Spiderman toy that I think has ever been made.&nbsp; He is a huge Spiderman fan.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a little overwhelmed though by all the presents and all the people that were there.&nbsp; Whoever came up with the concept of Chuck E. Cheese's is a very rich person.&nbsp; That place was full the entire time we were there.&nbsp; In fact, every time we have been there, it's been full.&nbsp; It's a cool place for kids though, they have a blast there.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  All for now....Happy Birthday Connor!!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I must be a glutton for punishment.  I played softball again last night and now I feel like I can barely move.  Pitiful, I know.  It's a good kind of sore though, the kind that makes you feel kinda good because you know you were at least doing some kind of physical activity.  We tied the first game and won the second game.  Getting a tie is really crappy because it's basically saying you played the game for no reason, but they have to go along with the time limit rules, so what can you do?  Braxton began reaching for things yesterday.  Not a huge milestone, but I'm pretty excited about it.  He is one of the happiest babies I have ever seen.  He just sits in his bouncer and smiles, laughs and "talks" all the time.  He has got the absolute most precious smile I have ever seen.  His whole face lights up when he smiles.  And when he smiles, I have to smile because he's so darn cute.  I am so lucky to have him.    I've now got to get up the energy to get out this chair and do something else...probably go to the couch.  Pretty bad when walking to the couch is hard work.  Later.

      I just love 3 day weekends.  They are one of the most wonderful things in the world.  This has been a really relaxing weekend, although we have done a lot of running around.  We went to 4th of July celebrations, a family reunion and shopped a little.  Braxton was not too impressed with the whole 4th of July holiday.  We took  him to a street fair type of thing Saturday downtown and he slept through it all.  We went to see fireworks that night and he acted like he nothing was going on.  Then last night we went to Jess's to see some more fireworks and one firework squealed real loud and it made him cry, so all in all, I don't think 4th of July ranks as one of his favorite holidays.    Braxton was 4 months old on Saturday.  It's amazing in some ways to think he's only 4 months old because I can't imagine a time when he was not here with us.  It's like sometimes I think back and wonder what did Mike and I do before we had him.  He's such a happy little boy.  He constantly smiles and laughs, which absolutely melts my heart every time.  It doesn't matter how many times he does it, when he looks at me and smiles, the most overwhelming feeling of happiness sweeps over me.    We introduced Braxton to solid foods for the first time this weekend.  We gave him sweet potatoes.  He wasn't really fond of them.  But it was so funny.  I put some in his mouth and he just let them sit on his tongue.  He looked so cute that I started laughing and then he started laughing back at me, while sweet potatoes are dripping off his tongue.  We tried prunes yesterday and they went a little smoother.  We'll just have to keep trying new kinds and get him used to them.  So much to do today, but I think right now I'll go get back in the bed with Mike and Braxton, everything else can wait.

      Mike and I had a really good night last night. We went out with some friends of ours and had a real nice time. One of the girls we went out with is a friend of mine from high school. She is such a sweet girl and one of those people that you just can't help having a good time with. She makes me laugh so much. We always hate Thursday nights because it is such a bad TV night, so getting a chance to go out and do something else was a welcome opportunity.  The weather has turned so beautiful this week. It's really cool and doesn't feel like August at all. I am going to help my mom paint her living room this weekend. She has finally decided after all these years to get rid of her 1970's style wood paneling and jump into the new era and paint the walls. It's so funny because she has been so adamant on having this paneling in her house for a long time, then a couple of years ago she started watching those home makeover shows like Trading Spaces and now she wants to try redecorating her house. She's already done her kitchen and bedroom, so the living room is the last step. It will look really nice when we get it done.  Connor started "school" this week. It's not really school, it's just daycare at the school, but we still call it school. He doesn't actually start pre-school until August 30. I can't believe he is old enough to go to school. He's growing up so fast. He is such a big talker now and loves talking on the phone. We talk on the phone every day and he tells me how school was that day. He called me yesterday morning just to tell me he was taking hot dogs in his Spiderman lunchbox to school. How cute is that. Carson started going to a babysitter this week because Jess had to go back to work. He seems to be doing fine with it. The babysitter said he was a perfect angel the first day he went, so that is good news.  Braxton has been doing this fake cough all week. I'm not sure what the deal is with it, but it's really kinda cute. I'm not sure if he's wanting attention (which as you know, he gets very little of) or if something really is tickling his throat. It probably has something to do with the change in weather here.  Time to get Braxton and myself ready for work. Later.

      It's only 9:10 p.m. and I feel like it should be way past midnight.  I am so tired and have absolutely no reason to feel that way.  Mike and I had a good day today.  We let my Mom watch Braxton for a while and we went to the movies.  We saw "The Village."  We enjoyed it, although it wasn't what I was expecting.  When the movie started, they a small audio problem, which they fixed within about 5 minutes.  But they gave us free passes to use the next time we come to the movies, so it worked out well.   I considered that really going above and beyond to please yours customers.  We were happy with it.   I took Braxton tonight over to the Fancy Farm Picnic.  It's the world's largest one day picnic.  Big whooptie doo.  I haven't been in a few years and now I remember why.  There are so many people and most of them stupid acting teenagers.  I dread the day Braxton grows up to be an annoying teenage boy that gets on people's nerves.   The picnic is a really big deal around here.  People actually travel from a long ways away just to go to it.  My uncle used to live in Chicago and would drive down every year for it.  I don't think it's worth driving 10 minutes for.   I did see a few old friends of mine, so I guess that was worth the hassle of the annoying teenagers.   We rented some movies to watch this weekend, but I don't think I can make it through one.  The bed is calling my name pretty loud.  Until later...

      Braxton is 5 months old today.  I can't believe that.  Boy, has my life changed in these 5 months.  Actually over the last year, there has been so many changes.  Mike and I were talking tonight at dinner, how this time last year, I couldn't eat anything that didn't make me sick.  It's amazing to think back at what we were feeling this time last year.  We couldn't believe that we were actually going to have a baby and yet so nervous about everything that came along with having a child.  Needless to say, it has been the absolute most wonderful thing that has ever happened to me.    We are so lucky.  Braxton is so incredible, it's hard to put into words just exactly how much I love that little boy.   I look at him and see little things that remind me of myself and others that remind me of Mike, it's like he is such a good mixture of the both of us.  Although all of his bad traits, such as temper and lack of patience, Mike wants to attribute to me.   He may be right though, who knows?  Last night, I played 3 softball games in a row.  We had to win all three to win the tournament, we lost the last game by two runs.  We played for 4 straight hours.  Needless to say, by the end of the night, I was dead tired and sore.  I couldn't even sleep very well because I was so sore.  Mike said I groaned everytime I moved last night.  That's pretty sad, I'm 24 and already falling apart.   Got to do a few things around the house.  Until later....
