      Hey kids! This is great. I love that we can just let everyone know what is going on. CORINA, if you haven't bought the tickets yet, I need one more. Just give me your account # and I will put it in there. (if you don't want to post it here, just send it to my email address)  urlLink tls0710@hotmail.com . I guess me and Gray (and probably Erin) will stay at your house if its ok, and if it gets too crowded, just let me know and we will think of something else. It was great seeing you the other day, even just for a while. I bet you are glad you left before the hurricane, because it was pretty boring. I mean we drank and stuff, but nothing too exciting. Glad to hear your parents came up to see you Besty. I bet Ginny will have a crazy good time and have lots of stories for her little friends at home. Stacey just came back from NY and she went on the Sex and the City tour, Carrie's apartment, random bars, and some of the places the girls always ate. She said it was fabulous, I was wondering if you have gone.  Tanya I never see you, and now I know where you are all the time. Kyle's right?? I have even been around the Alpha Phi house some since Cotty moved in the other day to be house mom. Rush is full on crazy right now, and I actually volunteered to help them with it. After I told them that, the bad news came:  Cheryl Elmstrom is the alumni in charge of Rush. WHOHOO I will be around her a lot the next month (GAG!) Oh well I will get through it. No Angelica, so that will help. And I heard Anna will be there too so we will survive! Anyways talk to you girls later!!!

      Ok so here is the latest on the ECU vs. State tickets.... I tried when I was in Greenville the get tickets, but the ticket office was closed both times that I went there....Leave it to ECU to slack on regular business hours. So I am going to call and place the order for tickets. Have no fear because i called today and there are still plenty of tickets available. As for all of you who have payed thanks for being prompt. But there are still a number who have not given me any money. Email me and I will send you my account information, and you can deposit the money into my account.  my email: crice urlLink @5rices.org   THanks! Corina  PS Tanya and Betsy good to hear from both of you. Betsy I hope I get to see you over homecoming, but right now I am torn between going for homecoming or going for reggae....what does a girl do??

      Corina this is great, just as Besty said.  I am not good at keeping in touch with people as some of you know, but hopefully I will since you have started this great lil site.  Betsy I am so glad you are still loving NYC, tell Biz I said hello.  By the way for those who didn't know, I got a job working at good ole' Ryans Steakhouse where I am waitressing.  It's not the best, but at least I am bringing in some kind of cash flow.  The bad thing is, I never have time to do anything becuase I am too afraid to ask off.  More news, I am going out with someone. How crazy is that?  He also lives two houses down from Becky's old house so needless to say I just cannot stay away from 4th street.  Anyways, I too cannot make it to Wilmington this weekend but I hope everyone who can has a blast.  Oh by the way Corina I knew you were coming into to town yesterday but I didn't know you would be leaving so soon(I left yesterday to come home to get a root-canal so I am not in G-ville), But please e-mail me or let me know  how to get the money to you for the game.  I know this is a lil long but I feel like I have so much to say.  I hope everyone is doing well, I'm pretty sure you are or else I would have heard something from Crazy B.  Oh well tell everyone I said hello and I guess this is bye for now.  ~Tonya

      What agreat idea, Corina!!!! You are such a genious! Now it can be like we're all hanging out together all the time. I really miss hearing about what everyone's doing on a daily basis, so I am fully expecting some insight from you guys. My news: sadly I can't come to the beach, or the football game. However I might be able to meet up with you guys in Charlotte after the game for some much needed rowdiness. My fam is in town this weekend, and it is a riot. They've never been to the city b4 and are amazed by everything. My mom has been going on and on about the ginko trees- shes strange i know.  Biz and I are taking Ginny out tonight to some of our fave bars, including my fave Saketini place. For any of you who have never had a sake-tini, you need to indulge. Check yous latas!

      Hey everyone, I am going to be in Greenville next week, and will be getting tickets for anyone who wants them provided they deposit money into my account prior to Wednesday of next week. It is 45 dollars, and this will assure that we all get to sit together.  Also I know a lot of people are planning on getting hotels, but me and Stephanie have a big place, and plenty of room. So if you can't afford a hotel stay with us. I am looking into a 15 passenger van for the game to get there and back, but email me if you want my account number to deposit the money!
