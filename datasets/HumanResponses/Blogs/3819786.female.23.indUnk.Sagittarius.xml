      With or without you.. It has given me goose bumps time and again.. every single time i've heard it. Yes.. of course it's the age old song by U2. Sometimes I wonder what is it about Irish men!  There's passion, sadness, love, rejection, acceptance, submission, longing, ego, pain .. and tears.. all rolled into one piece. I don't think its possible for a woman, a woman in love, to not think of her man in it. If she doesn't, all I can say is, I hope their love doesn't ever reach the stag where it becomes too much of a survival instinct. Ironic.. it doesn't even contain that word once.. of course its not required..or may be it cant be required..  I was told by a close friend once that this song happens to be the most popular song among men after a separation. I don't know why or how. I am not a man. May be I wouldn't have been able to comprehend if even if I were. But I do believe that at one plane, these two species are all the same. They need something that they can't do without but still hate to ask for.  I don't know what de Bono was think while writing this piece but a song.. an idea is how its looked upon by the perceiver. For me.. whatever it evoked .. intense will remain an understatement for it.

      White paper extracts Network Evolution towards IP Multimedia Subsystem  January 5, 2004 Type: White Paper The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) offers operators the opportunity to build an open IP based service infrastructure that will enable an easy deployment of new rich multimedia communication services mixing telecom and data services.  CDMA Code Division/Spread Spectrum: CDMA for Consumer Electronics  Published: July 20, 2001 Type: White Paper Code Division Spread Spectrum is one form of CDMA communication technique optimized for the cost conscious, high volume and short cycle consumer electronics market.   Code Division Spread Spectrum Techniques for 900MHz, 2.4GHz Wireless Telephone and PABX Applications  Published: July 20, 2001 Type: White Paper A new spread spectrum technique for consumer cordless telephones and PABX is described in this paper. UTC Time and Frequency Dissemination via the IS-95 CDMA Mobile Telecommunications Infrastructure  Published: June 11, 2001 Type: White Paper An exciting new way of obtaining precision, UTC traceable time and frequency has come of age.   Wireless Cummincations Systems Content Control for Wireless Data: An Opportunity to Drive New Revenue & Deliver More Value to Customers  Published: April 1, 2004 Type: White Paper In this paper, we'll discuss what Content Control is, some of the content opportunities that exist for Service Providers, and how Content Control is accomplished.    Attacking the TCO of Wireless Communications  Published: March 1, 2003 Type: White Paper In this white paper, you'll learn more about this simple approach for dramatically reducing the total cost of ownership (TCO) of wireless communications in the enterprise.  Creating the Networked Home  Published: August 3, 2001 Type: White Paper The networked home is fast becoming a reality, enabling consumers to link the growing number of electronic devices in the home to the outside world via a high bandwidth data pipe.   Technical Issues Involved in Implementing Next-Generation Networks The migration of wireless/mobile networks from 2G to 2.5G and 3G presents a myriad of challenges, particularly when the new technologies require additional base stations. From a network infrastructure perspective, the migration from cdmaOne to cdma2000 1xEV offers the most cost-effective methodology for implementing 3G; and the migration from TDMA to GSM/GPRS and, ultimately, to W-CDMA is the most complex of the currently proposed migration paths. However, the benefits of cdmaOne are diluted by the fact that its penetration rate is less than 20% of the global wireless market. Exhibit 1 shows that the global capital expenditure for base station infrastructure is expected to range between $72 billion and $77 billion over the next four years, with GSM and GPRS capturing the lion's share. Furthermore, the base station capital expenditure for W-CDMA is expected to increase over the coming years as wireless operators implement 3G networks.

      My hands are literally full right now, with one grabbing my visa to the US of A and the other, my resignation letter. I am happy and sad.. and confused. But all this with a relieved smile on my face.  I remember that day well enough..there i was working in the cubicle of mine, writing a shell script and hoping i would meet the deadline that evening. Now that surely didn't mean we dont go by the rules of the unofficial guide book of our office to be happy.. one such law demanded i sign in yahoo mail for the n'th time in that hour. Oh Bingo! mail from one of the universities i had applied to for my MS program. Now i dont exactly remember what i did after i saw the magical words.."congratulations". Did i scream..or hugged my surprised colleague.. or the most likely.. just fainted! After my initial moment of glory came the devastating hard fact that the particular expensive school in question did not believe in offering scholarships to graduate students..sheesh.. what a baised attitude towards international students..I sure deserve better..so there i go back to my routine waiting for more such congratulatory mails..  Thankfully i didnt exactly grow old waiting.. when Drexel the saviour came to my rescue.. that too in the form of a home delivered letter. And this time not just one sheet but two.. sure enough.. they were giving a scholarship! Now thats when you feel you are offered what you're worth..or is it a make-believe.. Anyways, after all the good and the bad news..Drexel seemed like the only viable option.  My boss at work had got suspicious since she had never seen me smilling my 'know-it-all' smile in front of her. My leave card had started growing longer in length and visa process almost at its completion. Eventually I start realizing that I might not be where I am right now.  A new place, new people, new friends, new weather, another student life.. almost like a sequel to the one i live now. I suppose i am ready for it. The age old smile all intact but just tainted with a lil apprehension.

      Happy Birthday America!   The above words make one see the star spangled banners with all its glory and its eventful history. People who get titillated with research and technology, people keeping the world's economic figures on their finger tips, people in social circles where being called highly traveled need to be a mere understatement, or even normal people who don't need any categorization, from all over the world, can, as they say, love it or hate it but cannot ignore the usa.  Since time immemorial, this place has been remembered as a land of opportunities. It's a place where ones thoughts are believed to have the right to have free rein and their pen, a free flow. The 'work hard, play hard' attitude has lured many youngsters to persue their dreams in this country. Not to say they were wrong, since one can write pages on the many success stories within these immigrants. But how long and how many, only time can tell. There is an old latin proverb, 'A man is not where he lives but where he loves'. Simply put, if you are happy by the end of the day, it really doesn't matter where you live. Your patriotism remaining intact, one realizes that what you are doing is a simple animals instinct to be happy.  But doesn't every coin have another side to it. Whether you pick up a newspaper, magazine or an article from the net, you can't escape some of the scary and scared faces of this same country. It might be the arrogance of their political biggies, their inhumanely treated prisoners or even their emotionally wounded victims of 9/11. All these leaves lots of questions in mind unanswered. Why an Abu Ghraib story, why so many immigrants  under threat, why are airports closed at a slight alarm. What's turning this free spirited country into a coward?  I am an average indian girl believing that there are more good than bad to every thing including this country and am just one among the many people who will set foot in this new shore this year. I am leaving behind a lot of things .. a well settled comfortable job..my parents.. a city i have grown up in..a bunch of small but very close friends and probably ..the man i might have married someday. Let us wish that on this 228th birthday of America, me and many like me are proud of our decision someday.
