      I made a Dr. Appointment for me on the 31st @ 130 to check a spot on my hand.   I pray it is nothing!!!   Its kinda scary,  Ken says he thinks it cancerous.  BUT ya know..i have learned one thing in life...I will always be ok... so I say its not going to be anything..(positive thinking) ...but I hope they take it off..cause i hate the way it looks.  :-)    Just dyed my hair again..I love it this time... Cant wait for hair to grow longer........   I want some excerise equipment... wanna keep my self in shape. GEE  this is all about me...  I dont normally do that....   But now that I am on that subject...i have been pondering lately.... I listen to the people here at work talk.... men as well as women... and everything they say is "ME ME ME"  and when I ask well what does your wife think or what about your husband...i get this look like I am nuts... one person even responded....  who cares..what he thinks... Maybe it is just me...but I always try to think about what the other person wants/needs/or how they feel.   am I wrong for thinking this??  I think not!  but maybe so.... like I said...just pondering............

I know one day he is going to make it big.  I am so proud of him.  He came home yesterday and was telling us that a company that didnt even return a call on his resume, he will be teaching their whole IT security department... :-)  can you see my proudness showing through???????????  I keep telling him he is so smart.  One day he will realize it.  He is even going to have to go to California for SANS training.   My heart just swells for him.  Our kids are doing wonderful.  Kimberly broke my heart. She brought a test to me and Ken and she said.  I know I am not doing well....I need some help.  My heart broke into a million peice.  Bless kens heart.  He is going to get her to read to him every night.  Have I said how lucky I am lately?????????  I am extremely lucky.  Thought lately I feel as if he is so distant from me.  I dont want that to happen.  I truely love him.  I feel that I never knew what love was til now. I hope I dont screw it up...  well gotta go.

      Here I am sitting here wanting to be held But no one is here I am alone again Tears streaming down my face I am so mad or maybe its that I am so hurt I was told something today that I knew deep down but I guess I didnt want to hear it But none the less it had to be said I am a female  wanting to work in a mans world  Doing what I want to do the most I was 16 when I realized what I wanted to do with my life and now look at me...what do  I do I talk to users I dont do any of the things I wanted I have got to get back on track You know what I am going to do  I am going to show all who doubt me what I can really do I will show you  One and all I will show the ex who told me I would be nothing in life I will show the employeer who says a female will never get anywhere in this field I will show the employeer want to be that I am not just a salesman,  I am an engineer and I will show anyone else who doubts me I will show my husband that he has someone to be proud of  I will not ride on his wings to get my glory but I will stand alone do it my self with out help  and in the end  Stand up with sholders back in a proud stance and say see....I knew I could do it. You all should of been proud of me and not mocked me. and stand next to my husband the one I love and adore,  and tell him thank you for standing beside me and making me realize what I didnt want to see and pray that he will be proud of me as well.

      Sometimes I think I love way too much...does that make sense???  I love Ken so much and I am afraid to show him how much..I guess I am afraid that I will get hurt.  We are looking into getting him a new vehicle.  I was wanting one myself.  But I have changed my mind.  I dont really care what people think ya know.  Screw them is my attitude.  If you dont like my mercedes....then stick it up your rear.   I really want to loose weight but I find it impossible not to eat at least something.  So I am going to try to eat a little at lunch time...and then that be my last meal.  I think I can do that.  I want to stay sexy for my baby....  See how my mind goes...I keep thinking and thinking....I want to clear my head.......well gotta go..am going to go help my mother n law move.

      well...I have a day of thinking.....the kids thrilled me (well 2 of them) by asking me to ask their dad to let them live with me.  I dont know why I am like them, I am scared to death of them, see their is one thing I know about him.,...it is that he usually gets what he wants..and I am so afraid that he will do something to make me loose the kids forever...and that is what my kimberly is scared of Work..i got to thinking about that today too....I had to sign something stating that I agree that they charge me 10 dollars in taxes every month..ya know its not the 10 dollars...but its the fact that they say I have to carry the cell phone...and that I have to be on call, and that I have to work that SAT....or answer the call at 2 am...then they are going to charge me for that ummmm luxery..then say you cant use the phone for personal use??  i have never used if for personal use and never will..but GEEEEEEEE I wasnt going to use this for bitching...but both have made me so upset that my teeth hurt from gritting....and I dont want to bother my ken about it....   well such is life.....I am just glad that I have my family...ken and all   4 kids..... i love them with all my heart......

      LOVE>.....................I feel so loved!!!  I love it when I feel this way.    I have really been down on me lately...but tonight I have had a chance to rest and think.....  Yes ,... I have gained some weight... I can get it off ...... I know I can....  and you know what else ................... I can run a network too ... I will be given a chance... and I will prove it to everyone.  I also...will prove to TERRY SR>  that I am not scared of his ass no more and I will get  my kids.  and Ken and I will have a wonderful family with our 4 kids.  I even understand why he doesnt want a 5th.  I am not upset with that any more either.  I Love my Ken with all my heart.  I will always want one of his children.  BUT... I know 5 is alot.   I will always love ken.  We always tease around about how much we love each other.  But let me tell you, the way he makes love to me, the way he makes me feel, no matter what I look like whether its a day that I feel like crap or a day I feel sexier than ever..he always tells me I am beautiful.  I know GOD meant for me to meet him.. and to love him... he knew exactly what each of us needed. .... BABY if you read this....I LOVE YOU

      I feel like shit again!!  I totally hate the job I am at.   I know  more that most of the people on the level above me.  Today one of the Engineers made a comment to the people at the bank we are working on that I am level one.Making me feel about an inch high.  I could of cried.   I really feel lately that I am not wanted...not needed...and stupid.  Cause if I was smart. People would want to hire me. I feel totally worthless when it comes to my carreer.  And why in the hell am I so scared of standing up to the kids real father????  I guess I know what he is capable of...and that really scares the hell out of me.  He could convince a nun that she had sinned...ya know what I mean???  He is good....so I dont know how to handle him.  Thank god Ken and all 4 kids love me....  I am not bitching...I am just getting things off my mind so I dont dwell on it.

      Oh my God!!!!!  Kimberly about Ripped my heart out.....not her fault....but Whenshe comes to me crying like she did or afraid to talk.....I break down... I cant stand it.   She wants to live with me so bad.  She says her daddy threw away her diary because she wrote in it that she wants to live with me.  He threw away both of her diaries...What kind of a dad would do that??  I know...a dad that never wanted you in the first place... He is such a sorry dad.....  now look at me... i have 3 children by a man who never wanted them....and I will never have children by a man who wanted  the child he had...(his ex will never know how lucky she was).   Why cant all dads want the children they create??  But its fine with me he doesnt want them..but he uses them as pawns to hurt me....GOSHHH  WHAT AN ASS I was married tooo...

      Today...I was all happy....well there are some things in my life that I am not happy about...but I didnt know I was living a lie.  Today..someone who knows about me...and I dont know.. sent me a message that my husband wasnt happy with me.  Says that I do not make him happy in bed.  (that cut me like a knife..says he is bored with me already).  Told me that he is not happy with the way I keep our home.  I have to admit on this one..I am not happy with that either.  I have been talking to a Dr. explaining to him that I seem to not be able to get anything finished.  He took some blood work, but asked me about the things I have been worried about (I had a huge list) and he said his wife got like that.. we are still waiting on the test results, but he told me to take a breather and relax and stop worrying.(did I say with relaxation and some understanding his wife is better)  Well I am about in tears again and I hate when I do that at work.  See here is where the lie is... I thought my husband was happy with me. So I went along all happily thinking some of my life may suck but I have this husband I thought he understood that its not that I dont care... I care alot... I hate the way  things are kept.  Now what do I do?  Here I am saving up for things to make his office look great.  I have not been eating lunch so I could save money to do this...Now dont I feel stupid.  Cause this person even told me he was upset cause I never finished his office...but I was just waiting on getting pics of the kids and from our wedding and wanting to order the posters and things....Why cant I do anything correct...why cant I make anyone happy??

      OHHHHHHHHHHHH  AGONY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I swear I am having the LONGEST and WORST period every.  I feel like I am in constant PAIN!!!!  My darling husband is so sweet,  besides being so patient with me, he has been holding me so tight, and even laying his leg across my stomach to put pressure on it to keep the pain from being so bad!!!!!   I know I have the sweetest husband alive!!  I do love him so much.     I have to put in an insert concerning my DR appointment.,  I can tell the meds he put me on are working,  I am trying to hard to catch up on the house and things so I can finally be caught up and continue to keep a clean home.  But we have been through alot lately, and my poor baby keeps getting sick and my sweet hubby even broke his leg....GOODNESS!!  I feel so bad for them.  The older kids have been ok.  Kimberly was put on some meds for ADD but I do not like that at all.  Austin has been acting up, but he is still so sweet.   He wants to live with me so bad just like his sister.  Terry jr, well he really tries hard to be good, but sometimes he has to let go.   I think its the BIG brother syndrome.  I am so happy I have 4 wonderful children.

      I feel like shit.  We had friends coming over and I got up after a rough night of not sleeping and worring, and cleaned the house and wanted to make everthing look perfect for our friends and my husband.  I had a whole 2 hours of sleep.  Well they got here, and now look at me...I am at home again.  Everytime we get a chance to go out I get stuck at home. Last time I could not go because we have no sitter.  The time before that we did actually leave the house, His Aunt started acting up,we went home.  She went back out, he went to his friends house and guess what I stayed home and cleaned.  This time noone wanted to wait for the sitter.  You have no idea how I felt when I was told that I have to stay here. Sometimes I feel like such an outsider.

      I am so frustrated!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I want to clean my nasty ass house but I cant seem to find the time to do it right or I start but can never finish it.  By the time I leave work it is 600-630 and I dont get home til about 630-700.  Then I cook dinner and feed everyone (I usually eat standing up so I can get done faster) then I  make sure homework is done ,bath children,. Pickup the Kitchen  notice I did say pick up and not clean. by the time  i get a chance to go to the bathroom its 11 o'clock at night.  Then I think....  I can clean now...then I am too tired to do it .  My job is so mentally exhausting that It is hard to function when I get home.     I will clean my house,  I do not want to live in a pig stye.  I am so tired of it.  But, when I do get it clean I dare anyone to leave a mess.  I will go OFF>  I know I will.   I think my family is staying sick cause I cant get our house clean.   I want a HEALTHY AND HAPPY family.

      oh hum... Yesterday was a bad day for my Ken. I wanted to hold him all night long and make hard passionate love to him.  Sad thing is...I didnt feel like he wanted me.  this has really made me upset.  He laid next to me and masterbated....I normally do not care.  But this nite...I really wanted him.  I get up early so I laid down knowing he needed to have some unwind time.  Then he didnt really go to sleep until it was time for me to get up.  I am not really taking this personally..But it does hurt my feelings...I want my hubby to lay next to me and hold me all night.  Guess I am selfish for that.  But I dont like this feeling that he does not want me.  It really makes me feel awful.  I have been feeling bad since gaining some weight. (but I am working on that)....But I know he still loves me...I just want him to desire me.

      UUGGHHH......What a day...Why cant people leave MY family alone. I am talking about my family as in my husband, terry, kimberly Ausitn and Brian.  It started this morning.  Mawmaw called to see how Mymommie was doing.,...and how was her heart.  I told her that I think she is doing ok that I havent heard from her.  She started talking about what happen the other night and How she was told it was Mine and Misty's fault for taking the kids over there.  Well I told her it was my fault I am the one who asked Dad to watch the kids.  I am the one who was suppose to bring them over. If I knew what was going on then I would have not let my 4 children go.  I told her that I did not know what to say when the boys asked my what a Whore was.  She asked how Ken was...I told her that after the argument that him and mom had I was very worried about the both of them.  WEll the next thing I know I am getting another phone call from MOM......asking what did I tell MawMaw...well come to find out that mom told mawmaw she didnt cuss in front of the children and I let the cat out of the bag when I mentioned what the children heard...I didnt mean too...then she said why did you tell her what went on at my house..I didnt I just said they had an arguement.  Well Mom told me that she was going to tell Ken what a lousy DAD he is and that I am the one raising Brian.  That is not true.  Ken does alot with all of the kids and she has no right to say anything like that about my husband.  Well when I said yes he does do things with them she named off stuff a mom would normally do anyways....uugghh...THEN in the car Mawmaw called....She said she just got off the phone with mymommie and they had it out cause mawmaw told mymommie that she must not really love ken and brian and us because she is dragging us in it and hurting Ken in the process.  She then said that she told mymommie that if she is not careful about what she says around Brian then all that we have fought for will be gone.  That Stacey will find a way to take Brian away.  Then she said mom told her that if she called the HRS right now..that they would take all 4 kids away.  (this is not true.  i have been working real hard on getting caught up on all of this.) But me and my big mouth repeated what Mawmaw had said.  And Kimberly heard it.  The first thing Kimberly did when she got in the house was start throwing up.  It made her so upset. I asked her what was wrong and she asked me who would call the HRS  and make them take them away from me and Daddy (that is what our daughter calls ken).  I told her not to worry about it cause it would not happen...But I hated to see her have that reaction. I do love my family and I love mom and Dad...but why ...I dont understand any of this.  I am not going to question it I am not going to mention it to Ken....cause I dont want him any sicker than he is...but it does seem that I may have to start posting here alot to keep me sane.  I dont want to go off on anybody messing with my family.  But I will.  NOONE is going to seperate us 6.  THIS IS MY FAMILY and I will fight anyone who wants to tear us apart.

      MY HUSBAND...... I love my husband with all my heart.  I hope he really does know much Love him.  I am so mad at his mother right now that it isnt funny.  She knows that he is a depressive person and that we have been struggling..not personally but with finances....and what does she do?? She drags him in the middle of her and his dad.  I love my mother n law very much....but I hate to see my Husband treated that way. I was so worried about him last night.  I was afraid he was pushed tooo far last night.  He doesnt realize how much I worry about that and it does make me angry when I see someone who knows about him ... to push him that far....  I am also upset that she talked in front of the kids the way she did.  Brian and Austin told me that she yelled at them to be quiet when they tried to talk to her when they were at their Dadaddies. And they both asked my what a WHORE was.  Because she kept saying that in front of the them that their Dadaddy had his whore in her house.  I wish the kids would of never went over there.  I pray to god that Brian doesn't go to his mothers house and say what he heard.  We have fought so hard for him that I pray nothing ever happens to turn the judges decision around.  I know she is hurting and I do understand.  But I pray for now on that Ken and the Kids do not get stuck in the middle.  I never knew I was capable of loving someone as much as I love him. They also say that you cant love a child that is not yours as much as you do your own...that is  a LIE.....I love Bri - Bri just like if I was the one who had him.  Well I guess I should stop writing,,,but my mind is so full....and I am so scared and worried about my husband right now. I have been praying ever night that God takes special care of him to help him through all of this.

      Lately I have felt as if Ken doesnt find me attractive anymore.  I have been trying to diet. But now...I am going to do more than that...I am going to Diet.  I cant figure out what else may be wrong.  I want my husband to want me.  In the last month he has stayed up more than laying down with me.  I know his back is hurt and I know I was on my period.  But I truely feel as if he isnt interested in me.  Damn it my heart hurts.  But I will do what ever I can to make him want me again.

      I am so PISSED off that it isnt funny.  I dont think I have been this mad in a long time.  I should of known when I woke up in such a wonderful mood.  Did 2 loads of laundry a dishewasher full of dishes got my son up and cooked for him and my husband, I felt great!!!!    The day at work was a Monday but I could handle it.  Then my private line rings.  Its Amy.   Asking me if ken was going to go to work today!   I said yes he is going to try hard to get there.  She said Well I need to know now not later.  I called Ken to make sure he was feeling kinda ok.  He was in pain and took some meds he was going to wait for the meds to set in before going to work.  WELL I called that bitch back to let her know then she started in on me, she said that she needed to know now and that she couldnt wait til later to find out if she needed to find someone to teach this class.    She said the classroom needed to be set up and I asked if she was sure.  One of the classes the students do it.   She started in on me....WELL rick said....blah blah blah....YOU KNOW WHAT....I dont give a FUCK what RICK says.   He needs to keep his ass out of that OFFICE . I am so tired of people like that BITCH and like the COKE snorting geek to walk all over ken.  And now look...I am so pissed off I cant enjoy my family tonight.   Why cant everyone leave my family alone?????   Ya know....Ken is doing what he loves but he cant enjoy it.  I realized a while back that I wanted to work for a company and do some networking while teaching the others the enjoyment Networking can be, like Ken did me.  And because someone ran their mouth and lied saying that he took took my MCSE tests that I didnt get the job that Justin had promised.  DAMN IT...... and now I am stuck in this stupiud ass position talking to users who cant even remember to take a floppy out of the drive. Or loose their shit cause  you tell them not to stoere stuff on the hard drive and then their computer crasses, or the user who fucking cant even find the start button.  NO WAIT the best one yet.  The vice president of the bank who blames you for him typing in the generic password wrong , when all it is , is the name of the company and he says its your fault he cant spell it write.  UUGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH   if I find out who told him that Ken took my MCSE after I studied hard and sent my kids to my moms for a month so I could do nothing but study, and .....I will kill that mother fucker.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I have only had a few dreams in my life and being an Engineer was one of them,  I have a couple of more some will come true some wont.........but damn it.   someones lie is  going to keep me from doing my dream.  I just knew if I got in with a small company then a larger company would notice me.  Or we could of made that company big.  Oh well....aint nothin I can do about it now,...what is said is said.....what is done is done.......But I warn ya now.....I will slap the cunt if she talks to me again in that tone of voice.  This is a warning and a promise.  It is not a threat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

      I never talk about sex / love making between my husband and my self.   But, last night I cried when he was making love to me.  Not because it was rough, not because he hurt me.  But because, I have never felt such love and tenderness in all my life.   It was the most amazing time I have ever had.   He made love to every inch of my body. The feeling of his hands running gently across me as he made me shut my eyes and not open them as he caressed me not knowing where he would touch next.  His sweet, tender Kisses.  The  words that he was saying to me.  Hearing the love in his voice when he  told me he loved me over and over again. We of course had made love a lot, had sex a lot, fucked a lot.  but last night was just amazing. The true  feeling of love.     This was truely one of the best nights of making love that we have ever had.  The other one I would put above this and I cried that night too, was the night we made love that it was so wonderful that he set the date for the wedding.  I never knew I could love someone like this and to be honest, sometimes its scary.  I want to protect my heart.  But I know deep down I dont need to protect it from him.  One of these days I will let me guard 100% down and he will realize that I love him as much as I say I do.  I thank God every morning and every night that he gave me such a wonderful family.  He gave me kimberly and austin and terry..knowing I would gather strength, and wisdom and give my love to and grow with.  He gave me Brian and ken to also share my love with, I have so much to give all of them. I think he gave me Brian to grow with as well, and to love with a special love. But Ken, I think he gave me him for a special reason.  God knew that I had love to give, but he also knew that I needed love and I did not know (dont) how to accept it.  I think he put us 2 together, because he knew we both needed true love and he knew Ken would teach me, not only to accept love but to teach me how to be love and how to give love to a man.  I know this sounds sappy.  But I really KNOW not think...that Ken is my  soul mate.

      I have learned. I am not a good person.  I went out last night, with the intent to get my nipples peirced.  I had to wait on the guy so Misty said lets go have a drink.  I didnt think my husband would mind.  I thought it would relax me. We got the drink and then went and got the percing.  WEll husband did mind. I screwed up my marriage and I am not sure if I can fix it.  My heart hurts, my neck hurts, my throat hurts. My nipples hurt.  I was told last night I was a bitch ,.  Well I guess I am....I was told I was like Stacey. That hurt me more than anything.  I try to make sure he has everything he needs and some of what he wants.  I didnt realize I was such a bad person, but I do know now.  I was told I was having an affair.  He said with my ex husband.  That is the grossest thing that I have ever heard.  If that man ever touched me again I would cut off his dick..cut off his hand and place the dick in it.  I was the scaredest I have ever been last night, why? becuase I let a drink come between my husband and me.  It didnt scare me that I was held down.  hurt like hell, not breathing is scary but I must of deserved it.  Just like I told Misty, he wouldnt hurt me without a reason cause he loves me.    I will never go to a family function again.  Cause all knows.   I wont tell them I made him so mad that he held me down by the throat, that is embarrassing,(I didnt mean for that to happen) I wish the bruises on my neck were not there, and the scratches on my face cause I dont want anyone to know.  His mom must of told maw-maw,  cause now she is calling.  I guess everyone thinks I am Stacey now.  Is there need to stay in this family? Yes there is, because I love him.  But I will NEVER go to family functions again. cause NOW I know that I will be treated as Stacey and I am no stacey.  I gucked up one night.  I have to go get my house in order.  I wont have time ever again to sit down and type. So I say GOODBYE to everyone.

      I dont know what to think about me any more.  I use to think I was a good wife and a good mother.  But I must not be.  The other day,  I made Ken a dinner that really sucked.  I was trying to make a great dinner and it turned out to be the worst ever.  Then he told me how I should keep our house clean but I dont.  It is my responsiblity, but I cant seem to get it done.  I have been trying hard to play catch up.  Tonight I am staying up to finish the laundry. But today out of no where.  My mother n law came over, returned her computer?!  (still not sure why) and then told me that she would be coming over to help me clean house and iron everyweek,  That really made me feel inadequate.  Plus the oldest 3 really acted up today.  But I truely think that is because they had to go home to their dads and did not want to. But it made Ken feel like they were picking on Brian.  So see...I am not a good wife, and not a good mother.  Cause if I was either,  none of this would of happened.  It seems the harder I try, the worse I get.  DAMN IT!!  I really hate me.

      I have so many thoughts running through my head.  I asked Ken to take me for a drive last night.  But the kids were all up late.  I wanted to talk to him.  But last night again, he got up set with me and didnt come to bed until morning.  He accused me of not wanting to blow him any more.  That is so far from the truth. He doesnt know that in our fight the other night a tooth got broke.  IT HURTS...and that in the inside of my mouth I had a HUGE swollen layer on the inside of my lip with a cut on it.  It hurt to eat more less blow.  But I didnt want to tell him cause I did not want to hurt him,  But come to find out.  It hurt him cause I didnt blow him.  I do love him with all my heart and I didnt know if it would hurt him if he knew I really got hurt the other night.  One more bruise left and It will all be over with.  THANK GOD!!   I love my husband with all my heart and I will never do anything like that again.

      I am so pissed at my ex -  He made me live through HELL when I was pregnant knowing he did not want the babies he created.  But, then he gets his Girlfriend pregnant and he is thrilled.  And to beat all..he is going through the clothes I saved that my kids had when they were little, and is going to let his new baby wear then.. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.....  You know what I dont understand why do guys want babies by other people and not by me?  I wish Ken was the dad of my children he is a wonderful father.  I love to watch him with Brian, and with the older kids!    He plays with them, loves on them, scolds them.  He is so perfect!   I found the most perfect man.

      My darling Husband did it.  He got the job.  He went to sign the papers today.  and then we had lunch.   It is so wonderful to see him as happy as he has been the last two weeks.  I keep telling him I have all the confidence in the world in him.  He doesnt realize sometimes just how smart he is.  Its just not smart.,  Its the Knowledge that he has and his ability to actually put it to use.  I think that is one of the things that attracts me to him too...I love a smart man.    Ok now on a uggh note.....I dont know why I am so afraid to show him how much I love him. I tried last week, but it was at the wrong time, and was accused of just loving on him cause he got that job.  Which isnt the truth...but did want to show him how proud I was/am of him.    Another note:  I am so glad that our baby Brian is back home.  Last week, we all 5 missed him so much....but this week I am having real problems missing the oldest 3.  I dont know when the last time it has hurt this much not to have them with me.  I am so lonely for them.   I am also having some serious problems with sleep...I cant seem to do it.  I am tired.  but cant seem to sleep...What is up with that??  My medicine for calming my nerves is missing as well.  Thats a whole other story....

      Why does not anyone ever listen to me?  I have tried to explain to everyone how it makes me feel and they seem to not care at all.  I dont mind help I really do not, but... I can iron.  I dont mind helping me match since I cant see some colors....But it makes me feel so Inadequate when someone has to come into my house and do something I should be doing.  I have tried to be nice about it... and I did not mean to get ill, I could not help it,  I just wanted to cry.  It makes me feel that I am not doing what I am suppose to be doing and that I am a failure.   I have said this...over and over again...but yet noone cares.  It makes me think also that they do not like the job that I do when I do iron (which is every day but weekends) .   AND.....I NEVER!!  let the kids leave without combing their hair and brushing their teeth!   What it looks like when they come home from school I cant help.   Well I am done steaming....Its not really steaming its just that my feelings are really hurt.  I mean hurt bad.

      Yesterday,  Everything was going as normal.   MyMommie picked up Brian from school.  I met them at the gas station.   Brian asked if he could go in with me when I was going in there to pay.  He kept holding myhand and saying...I love you mommy. I love you mommy.  Of course I was telling him I love him too.   Well when they left he kept calling me, just to say I love you and to chat.  I finally asked him what is wrong because Brian does not really like to stay on the phone and talk.  He told me he did not want to go at all today.  He says that alot...but today...I know he is serious.  After I talked to Him he talked to his Daddy.   After talking to his daddy, Stacey called and demanded to have Brain for 30 days.   That is not how it works.  It is not what is in his divorce papers.   After both of them cussed at Ken we called our attorney.  He in turn called them and let them know that we will be filing for a clarification of terms, and that they could keep my baby for a week.  But we must get him back.  will finish later.   6/6/03 Well it sounds as if we wont get our baby through the summer except for weekends.  UUGGHH....I will miss him sooo much.....  I want all 4 of my kids around all the time.    I really hate that his mom wants him to be around the abuse that goes on in that house.   I know we are basing it on what a 5 year old says...but I know he would not make up what he has said.

      ok.....Why won't it go away??  I don't understand.    The more I fight the feeling the more it comes.  I swore I would never write on this again.  but I since I am pretty much sure noone ever reads this.....But......I truely crave to have his baby.  I want a part of him to grow inside me. to nuture.  and to know that when the baby is born that the baby will have a dad who loves her/him intensly.  And have grandparents around too.   I know he does not want a child (which I do but dont understand) I try real hard to cover my feelings about this..but sometimes it makes me ill.  (which I dont understand at all either)  I do not know how to explain this but love....I love him so much...I want something of his...something we can share...something that we can both love and grow with.  also,  noone could ever take this child away from us.     OK...I am about to cry again...but I had to write this out ...so I can STOP thinking about it.You know, when someone asks you....what do you reallly want????????  all I can think of is to have my Kens baby.............................I pray that I can stop this feeling....its hurts my heart so.... to know I cant give him and he does not want...the one thing that I want to give him.........Please lord take this feeling away..........

      I feel so sick to my stomach.  Its a little of combonation of cramps....and a ucky feeling.  This weekend  We went to see my parents.  Ken and I got into an arguement on the way down there.  I didnt realize how unhappy I made him.  He gave me an ultimatum. I have to get the house clean in 2 days or he leaves me.  I am worried til I am so sick.  I hated leaving my mom.   I had to make my kids (well atleast 2 of them) go with their dad cause they did not want to. And now I am so worried that I am loosing him.  He has been asking me what is wrong.  I dont want him to know I am worriing.  I actually feel like I am going to throw up.  I hate feeling ill.  But I do not want to go through life with out him.  The sad thing is ....  I truely understand why he would leave me and I dont blame him an inch.  I wish I could be a better wife.  I am going to pray all night that GOD makes me a better wife and mother.  I feel so lonely tonight.  I want to be held.  I am no where near having the house clean.  but If I dont lay down I will get sick.   I just wish I could sleep some.  I do love him so.

      my heart hurts. My baby is wants to leave me.  How did it come to that?  It is all my fault.  I dont like feeling this way.  I want to show him that I love him.  But at the same time.  I am scared to show him cause it will hurt me even more when he leaves.  This is tearing me up.  I really do not think that he knows how much my love is for him.

      I dont understand why, when I think things are starting to look up and going to start being great, that it seems as if  I am wrong.  I dont know why he is so distant from me these last 2 days.  I have tried to show him I love him.  I have wanted to make love to him badly. (Unfortunately he is sleeping durning alot of those times).  I just want to go in wake him up and devour him.  He thinks I do not want him.  I do not know what to do. I do not want to loose my husband, I truelly love him.  I have to figure out a way that he knows all the time that I love him.  Next weekend is our annivserary.  They say the first year is the hardest.  I sure the hell hope so.

      This last week has been amazing.  Its like my ken and I have re-discoered our selves together.  It is so wonderful!!  Its amazing to me how I could love someone and feel as loved as I do right now.  He is the most awesomest (is that a word) person that I know.  He always ask me why I love him,  that is the hardest answer to give.. its not one thing in general...its a lot of littlle and not so little reasons why.  But I have to say its his intelligence that attracts me the most.  He has got to be the geekiest ;-)  smartest man I know....makes me wet just thinking about him.  Well He is at work today and I am going to go get the baby from grandmas.   We had the last 2 nights to ourselves..(you would think I would be drained ;-)   , but I just want to start all over again, making love to him).  We use to stay in bed ALL day long never getting out. but I had to go to work ;-(       Well...I just feel like my heart is going to explode with all of this feeling.    I just had to share it .  LOVE IS GRAND!!!!!!!!!!   Oh....and for those who love movies...we went out last night to the movies and seen Bad Boys 2.   IT is the most funniest movie  I had watched in a LONG time!!  <333 to everyone!!

      My life has been a living HELL lately.  My husband wants to leave me.  I think he has met someone on line who is making him feel special.  He is a wonderful person and I can see how that can be.  But I am his wife and I realized I have not been showing him the special attention that I use to. I am going to start back.  I want and need my husband back.

Well that is how I feel.  I try not to cry..I hate crying at work..but the tears just flow....DAMNIT!!  I just keep thinking...I am loosing 2  very important people in my life.  I dont know what to do to get him back.  I am just going to keep trying.  He says he loves me... he has never lied to me .. but right now..I just dont feel loved.    My heart is truely aching...I mean it really hurts... its not just a phrase.

      Well... Our anniversary is come and gone.  He got me this really cute tiger that we had to stuff, and name and it got a birth certificate.  I named her Kylie Ann Swain.     It is my most prize possion that I own.  Not even my computers are worth more to  me than that. I love this present more than anything else in the world that I have been given.  It may sound stupid.  But it even has a wish inside.  I wished a 2 part wish.  It may sound childess  but I pray my wish comes true.     I still think he wants to leave me.  I have come to the decision that I wont stop him.  I will just pray that he will come back to me.  I want to just devour him and show him how much I love him.  Why do I hold back.  I think I have been holding back all along.  DAMNIT...I love him.

      He doesnt realize I know...but Thursday, we were making love and his phone rang.  He hopped out of bed. Ran down stairs.  Came back up a little later.  He told me it was Richard.  But I am not that Niave.    His heart was beating like a little boy who just got caught doing something wrong.   I asked him, but he said it was Richard.   He normally doesnt leave the room when he is on the phone.   Then we went down stairs to wait for his parents to show. I grabbed his phone cause mine was dead and we were radioing them on it.  I opened it up to radio them and he had deleted all of the phone numbers.  Why would he do that if it was Richard.  It had to be her?  My heart hurts so much.  I do not know what to do.  I know what she wrote in LiveJournal is about him..again I am not Niave.  And it says she could fuck him right through the phone and that she is in love with him, and they talk on the telephone.  I wonder if he loves her.  My heart feels like it is tearing apart everyday.  I try to act as if nothing is wrong.  But....I try to show him how much I love him, so he wont forget.  Its like I am waiting for him to come to me and tell me that he is leaving.  When we make love, I know I am not that good cause I am worrying..will this be my last time?  I want to treasure it.  I know I mess up.  I started crying the other day when we were making love. He asked me why?  I told him it was because I love it.  and that is the truth, but its was really because I love him so much and am scared if loosing him!   He is all I ever wanted and needed in a man a love and a friend.  What do I do????????????

      This had been a HELL weekend.   I have never seen my husband like he was on Friday night.  Scary.  But I do love him.  I just thank god it is all over and I am doing what ever I can do not to make him upset with me.  I have been working real hard trying to really clean my house and then everyone is going to think I am the momma from hell when I dont let them mess it up,  I was up til 2:00 this morning.  Working on the house.  I am tired but its worth it as long as he likes it!   I am like 85% done with the laundry.  The downstairs is cleaned and I need to get the upstairs done next.     I have to say....I was hurting so bad the other night but did not want to make him feel bad so I told him my head hurt.  but My back was killing me.  I could hardly sleep for a couple of days and my throat ...ohhh my god how it hurt.  I did try giving him a Bj but it hurt so bad.  I know he wanted to make love to me the other night and I REALLY wanted to make love to him.  But I was hurting so bad.  The pain has finally went away.    Last night ....  I needed and wanted to make love to him so bad.  That is actually the main reason I was staying up. I wanted to show him how much I do love him.   He called at 2:00 saying he was going to eat with Daniel so I went to bed.  He came home and laid down..but did not want to make love to me.  It hurts so bad.  I wish he knew the reason is that I was hurting..but at the same time I do not want him to feel bad about it.  I just dont want him mad at me.  I love him so much. and NEED To show him.

      Today Mawmaw called.  Phyliss had told her about what the teacher had told to Ken and I about Brian.  Not playing and being upset about the camera his granmother bought him.  Phyliss and Big Rickey came up the week before and had taken Brian with them to mawmaws.  They came back with a camera and a toy.  The kids   (especially Austin) felt bad.  He said he never gets anything.  He asked mymommie if she got it for Brian and she looked at me and said no she would never do that to her Grandkids.    Well today, I asked MawMaw not to say what she said about the camera being to have proof Uncle Gary is bad.  I told her what the teacher said. But MawMaw got upset with me.  She said that she never bought Brian a camera.  I apologized to her.  But now I feel bad.  Oh well............

      Its not been the best birthday week, but I got use to my birthday not being special due to my dad never being there and my ex always seemed to forget.  But they choose that, this time it isnt chosen.  It just happen to be that noone is here. But Brian and I had fun.  We even made cupcakes.  He is so sweet.  We snuzzled night before last, but now that I cant get my tv to turn on he wont snuzzle,  its pretty bad when the tv wins out over mommy  HA.     With my husband being gone, its hard to believe how much I love and miss him.  Its not that I did not know that I love him, but him being gone just makes me realize how much.  I never want to be without him.  I am doing as he made me promise and am not sleeping on the couch, but I take everyone of his pillows and surround me, they smell so much like him.  Damn I love that man so much.

      Today we were at NaNas house, they were all talking babies.  I  had to leave.  Its hard to sit there and listen about how all their babies were born.  Its not that I do not want to talk about how mine was born but I dont because I hate the thought of mentioning the kids dad at their house. For one I think its disrepectful, for two, I just dont want to talk about it if their dad is concerned.  I just wish , I could have attributed to this family in that way.  No one understands that I when I had the kids the only people I had here was Terry and his mother.  In other words I had a man who did not want the babies to be born and his mother who agreed with him.  She never liked children and did not want her son to have any.   I listen to them on how they all had husbands who wanted babies and I hear how the family was there for them, I love listening to the stories.  I started to tell a couple of mine, and I know they love my kids, but its just different.  You know I thought I was jealous when it came this.  But I am not, I am just sad.  I do wish I could of had that.  I still ask though, how come no one wants me to have their baby?  What is wrong with me?

      I am so much in love, my heart aches does that make sense? Will I ever get over the worry that he will find someone else?  This is my biggest fear ever.           this

      Sometimes I think I post here when I have noone to talk to, this is a safe haven for me cause no one reads it either.  I feel my husband must think I am gross or something,  over the last few weeks, he has started leaving the house at night, like he did when he had found someone else.  If he does not leave then he stays up and not in bed with me. I know he works strange hours and is not tired when I am,  but he normally loves sex,  he doesnt even seem interested in that.  Twice this week he has not come to bed or made love to me, and when he has lately he has turned the lights out and tv off, i guess so he doesnt have to look at me.  Damn it, I feel as if my husband doesnt want me or doesnt like what I look like.  I am trying real hard to loose weight and have started excersing all the time.  I pray that he notices the difference when it starts to show,  I miss him deeply.  I am so depressed and my self esteem is so low....I just want to please my husband

      My heart is aching right now for my youngest son.  He went to his mothers this weekend.  He had been learning to really like the new guy she was with, Roger.  But now,  Roger is out of the picture and a guy named Bryon is in the picture.  He has got to be confused cause I know I am.   I know the only reason why he goes to see his mom is because she had him a little brother.    I  have always wanted a baby by Ken, one of his, to show him how much I love him.  My heart really hurts at times when I think that I wont ever have a baby by the man that I love so much.  But now, its going to hurt worse, because I am not going to give the kids (Biran,Kimberly and austin wants me to have a baby) what they want.    Thats ok, life goes on and so does my love, but I just need to find another reason for our children to want to stay.  One day they will realize how much Dad (Ken) and I love them.

      I am so depressed today.  Its the day our oldest 3 go to their dads house...and I have not actually laid down with my husabnd in 2 days.  I just want him to hold me. Its my time of the month, which probably does not help with the mood swing.  But I just want to feel loved right now.

      Today we were having fun.  It was a bad day since our airconditioning unit went bad.  But we were still having a good time.  I was wrestling with Ken and everything.  That was fun.  It has been a long time since we did that. But this time he really hurt me.  He slammed me down so hard that when he hit the back of my head I had an instant headache.  I tried to blow it off but it really hurts.    Today he hurt my feelings when he said I was not a real engineer.  I know I am not.  I have not had a chance to put my stuff to work but that really hurt my feelings.  Made me feel like Iwasnt worth shit.  Which is the way I feel at times.   oh well.. Iknow he was just teasing.

      I feel like crying. We are in the same room together not 2 words are spoken but he is smiling and grinning ear to ear IMing her.  If I say something I am jealous.  I am not jealous.  I just want some time to talk and laugh and play like we use to.  Get our connection back instead of giving MY click to someone else.    I AM PISSED and my HEART hurts.

      I get accused of being jealous.  I am not Jealous.  But it really irks me that my husband tells me he cant feel our click anymore, but instead of spending time with me trying to get it back he talks to women on line.  Maybe I am wrong, but if you are trying to click with someone else. You wont get the other click back and I will be damed if we do not get ours back.  He is worth too much to me to let some horny bitch take him even if its just mentally.  He is mine and I love him and I wont let anybody mess with it. But neither should he.

      Now he wants to leave me because I stood behind him on getting onto Brian.  I can never figure anything out. Was I suppose to be sympathic to Brian or Ken??? I just give up.  I hurt, my heart hurts my eyes hurt. I am tired.    I am tired just plain tired.

      Driving my son to see his real mom yesterday, brian looks at me and says "I just want to see Jarrett".  I said "Yeah, baby I know you miss your brother."  Then out of the blue he looks at me and said, "I wish you would have me a baby sister, mom said that her tubes are tied but that she can untie them."  But he went on to say that he wished his dad and I would give him a little sister of his own, one he could hold and rock.  That was so sweet.  I did not answer him, cause I want to give Ken a baby so much that I cant stand it and I didnt want to tell him Daddy does not want any more, so I just kept my mouth quiet and smiled at him and told him how sweet he is.

      I am cramping and ILL and haven't felt loved all week.  uugghh      I hate that I get bitchy when I do not make love, but to be honest I feel like he is making excuses not to make love to me and it hurts deep.  Maybe its just that its that time of the month and I am over reacting, but I have always said, that if he ever quits touching me or making love to me, then something is wrong...Something must be wrong

      This is the week.  This is the week that I get the kids.  I can only think positive thoughts.  I must get them, I know we do not have a cruel god, and that he will allow me to have my children of whom I love so much.  This week has not started out great, Ken and I have money problems, but it is something with alot of work we can over come. Notice I did not say Ken and I were having problems, just that we are having money problems.  We both want the best for our kids and us so we will get over this. I am not sure 100% how, but we will.  Its great to feel as much love for Ken as I do, I just wish I could really show him how much.  I do not understand my feeling of scaredness that I have when it comes to showing him that.  ON the way home frm taking Brian to witch, I had a lot of time to think,  I want nothing more and nothing less than to be with Ken and the four kids.  I know life is never going to be a piece of cake, but noone ever said that it would.  I wanted to call him up and tell him what I was thinking and how that I was feeling, It had such a hold on me,  I cried and cried, not really from sadness, but just because I love that man so much, I want to show him in everything that I do and say, and I am not good at that,  I really want to grow old with him (ok if you ask him, I am already old).  I never really thought about that with butt head.  But I think about that alot about Ken, I really want to grow old with him.   I came home for lunch today, not really planning on anything but seeing my hubby before he goes to work.We ended up making love, and I ended up crying.  I am truely scared that I am going to fuck up one of the best things that has ever happened in my life. I have one more dream of which I will not mention, but if this dream ever comes true, then I can tell you , that I know I will feel whole!  People say love is grand, but knowing you are loved is totally AWESOME.

      Today I lost a son. My heart hurts so bad that it isnt funny. I cant seem to do anything but cry. The worse part of it all is, that everyone seems to be ok with it. My little one doesnt want to call me mom any more. I cant tell you how that feels, I cant explain to you how crushed my heart feels. I truley feel alone.  There was always a time that when I felt like nobody loves me, BriKellen seemed to always know and show me how much he loves me. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up, the night mare never ends.   I want a baby so bad, one to have that is mine, that her dad wouldnt say bad things about me and I could be the mom and love the baby and play with the baby like I had wanted to do with the others,  Life just sucks.

      This week has been very lonely.  I dont get to see my precious hubby in the morning due to my work schedule and he is not waking up til its time for him to go to work. I try to lay down with him but I dont want to wake him up.  I am kinda getting sexually frustrated right now as well and that does not help.  I cant seem to satisfy myself and need him.    I have started my excercise and I hope to start setting up a routine. I am trying very hard to set up a routine for me so I can be more organized. You cant tell it yet but it is working.   I have a goal to loose 3-5 lbs a week and when I get down a little smaller than the size that I want I will start beefing up my excersise so I can tone up very well.  I am extremely excited about becoming fit.  Today after excercising I felt very energetic and felt so good.  I only had 4 hours sleep but still am not tired.  I love this feeling.    I cant wait to lay next to my husband while he rests and feel his arms around me, his head resting next to mine where I can feel his breath upon me. Feel his naked body against mine so cool, so soft, his legs wrapped around mine. holding me tight. Holding me, keeping me safe, loving me while he sleeps. I love this man so much.    One day he will realize that I love him way more than he realizes. Way more than he ever thought I would!

      Love!  Have you ever wondered what LOVE felt like?&nbsp; I&nbsp; know now. Its the tingling in your toes, its the sparkle in your eyes. Its the feel of your mans touch, its the warmth you feel from his breath as you sleep snuzzled up.&nbsp; Its the look in his eyes (you know the look I am talking about) its the sound of his laugh,&nbsp; and the way he makes you laugh.&nbsp; Its the drumming of his heart that you can hear through his chest. Its the way my baby makes me feel.  One day, he will realize what he means to me. The times that I tell him I love him more than life, is true, he will see that one day.   Baby I love you!&nbsp; This has been the loneliest week of my life, but thats not a bad thing, I just miss you when our hours clash like they did this week and it makes me even realize, how much and how deep my love goes for you.  I am truely yours ....heart...mind and soul!

      Thinking   Have you ever tried to stop?&nbsp; It seems like lately my mind is going 100 miles an hour. Not sure how to stop it.&nbsp;   I think its because I have worked so much this week that I havent had time to think about anything else, so when I get a chance to think, it all comes to me in a fast paste.&nbsp; Almost like I talk. (ok as fast as I talk)   One thing I have been thinking about is how come I work so hard for a company that does not give a shit. And the ones who dont work so hard is the ones they give all the special projects to that can allow them to move on to different areas.&nbsp;   uggh.... make it stop.   Another thing is....and another and another and another..... thats how my thoughts come to me.  back to back to back.   No wonder why my husband hates when I get to be a flibberty gibbet cause I never shut up, and what I have to say isnt really important its just my thoughts.&nbsp;He is wonderful and he tries to listen but &nbsp;I try not to talk though its hard but I have been doing a great job at it.&nbsp; But now it just rumbles in my head.&nbsp; I think I will start a new blog, one just to write down everything I want to say that no one will care about, and just get them out of my head.&nbsp; See I am rambling again.

      Teenage Punishment list - Updating daily (ha)   Cause:&nbsp; &nbsp;Tell parents you are going out to dinner (or what ever) and dont call til hours later - (even though curfew is at midnight but we are under the assumption that you will be home after dinner)  Punishment:&nbsp; Take away old curfew and put a new one in place - Be home by 630 on Weekdays and 830 on weekends. Until you can show us responsibility.&nbsp; (Will update later exactly what constitutes responsibility - when we figure it out)   &nbsp;

      Tongiht  Tonight Terry jr asked if he could go out to dinner with his girlfriend.&nbsp; That was at 5:00&nbsp; @ 1030 I finally hear from&nbsp; him.&nbsp; I told him it would have been common curtosy to call me and I would of told him it was ok to stay at her house late it is summer break.&nbsp; But I cant let this go unpunihsed. Yes he has a midnight curfew, but it was my understanding that he was just going out to dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ken said the punishment is having to be home by 630 during the week and 830 on week ends.&nbsp; That is fine with me.&nbsp; But I am going to make a list.&nbsp; The one thing that I hated when I was growing up is that mom and dad never did the same punishment for everyone.&nbsp; Maybe it sounds stupid, but I dont care. I always felt like I had the hardest punishment and when i asked my mom she said it was because she expected more out of me than she did them. Well thats not a good reason so I begin tonight.&nbsp; He is a 14 year old and I&nbsp; am having to learn.&nbsp; But If I keep track then I will know what to do and my job as a mother/parent may become easier with time. (doubt it though).
