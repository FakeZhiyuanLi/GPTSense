      You are a million miles away from me, Just like the distant stars above... Wish you were here and let me listen to your voice, And drive away the silence with your love...  Is it really you that I see, Or it's just a picture in my clinche? I called you a thousand times and received no replies, Tried to believe you are on the other line...  Regardless of what you do, Or where you may be found, I believe you are always beside me... Through the lush forests and meadows, Where elves and fairies dwell, I believe I will find you there...  In my deareast memories, I see you reach out to me, With your silver wings spread out with life,  Is it just my fantasy, Beyond time and reality, That will soon to be forgotten?  Regardless, I know We'll meet one day, When I go to the heavens above someday, And we'l make our dreams come through, Till I get over to you...

      Dear diary, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yesterday, after the chem remedial, I went to macdonalds to eat breakfast with peiling and qing kai. After halfway eating the harsh brown, it suddenly flew out of my hands and landed on the floor... sigh... my harsh brown!! sigh............. oh no... den peiling told me that i was only acting to be sad of the harshbrown... she was right actually... i was running away, i guess... i did not wanna think about anything else...  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; den i got up the bus to go home and found i had no fare left... den i checked my coins and still, no coins... i remembered that my friend once told me to pretend when you had no money on the bus. so iwent to the back discreetly and stood there silently until&nbsp;i got down at my stop... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at home, i thought about what peiling told me, i was running away.... but from what? Den i thought deeply about it. I was running&nbsp;from that&nbsp;e guy...&nbsp;she was so right... i do not wanna think about anything else anymore... i just wanna get through jc and get on with life. i&nbsp;oso going to a friend's birthday liao today... hahaxx...&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xueling

      Dear diary,  I am so happy to see Benedict and Pei Ling together again! I was so depressed when they were having the 'cold wars' between each other. When Benedict pretended that he did not see Pei Ling, I thought he was joking, but it was true... That time, I could see that Pei Ling was very sad... I felt sad for her too... The day before the oral, she was having a fever, I think partly because of everything she had faced... Everything was so bad for her that time... But now I am really glad that everything is over now!!   Xueling
