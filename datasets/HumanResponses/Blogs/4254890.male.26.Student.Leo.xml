      My favorite living artist, Austrian watercolorist  urlLink Bernhard Vogel , has made another  urlLink gallery  of his watercolors available online. Here's a taste:

      From  urlLink The Economist  (sub. req.), on why  urlLink Obama  will win:  The Keyes candidacy also smacks of tokenism. The candidate routinely denounces affirmative action as a form of racial discrimination. But what other than racial discrimination can explain the Illinois Republican Party's decision to shortlist two blacks for the Illinois slot — and eventually to choose Mr Keyes? He brings no powerful backers or deep pockets, and was thrashed in his two runs for the Senate in Maryland. And while you're at it: why yes, Chicago  is  "America's best run city".

      The FT has a fine  urlLink article  explaining the connection.  They also offered a positive  urlLink review  (sub. req.) of Michael Walzer's latest book,  urlLink Arguing About War .  Walzer is co-editor of  urlLink Dissent  and author of  urlLink Just and Unjust Wars .  The struggle against terrorism and the advent of humanitarian intervention make Walzer an increasingly valuable source of insight into the just conduct of these actions.  In addition, all should read his  urlLink "Can There Be A Decent Left?" , critiquing of the reactions of the political left following the September 11 attacks; his " urlLink The Four Wars of Israel / Palestine " is also worthwhile.

      It isn't a secret that there currently doesn't exist a good general halachic guidebook in english, suitable for beginners in halachic jewish observance, converts, and those simple lacking the language skills to access sources in hebrew. "Good" here means clearly written, straightforwardly presented/structured, level-headed, fairly lenient, and offering enough background to the halachot so that they can be understood as part of a meaningful system, but without excess hashkafic commentary.  The current options all miss on more than one of these requirements, stranding many without a good reference source from which to learn and get answers to questions as they come up.  Leaving these individuals to seek guidance from the available english language sources and their peers opens them to the influence of those who would make observance more difficult than it already is for someone starting out (or, speaking for myself, someone who's been at it for a few years now).  What to do?  Well, thinking back to my time at Hamivtar, I recall our Rosh Kollel Rav Reich praising Rav Chaim David HaLevi's קש''ע מקור חיים ( Kitzur Shulchan Aruch Makor Chaim ) for having many of these qualities. See  urlLink here  for a bio.  While I'm not intimately familiar with מקור חיים myself, by all accounts it appears to be the only suitable book that might serve as the source for a translation into english.  Translating מקור חיים would be a huge job, but it occurred to me it might be made doable through the use of a  urlLink wiki .  Using a wiki would allow anyone to contribute to a public, web-based translation.  Potentially, people or groups could make the project part of their regular learning, moving the translation along quite quickly.  Currently I'm just mulling over the idea of this project, and I'm looking for input on how it might be accomplished.  Obviously, the first thing to sort out is the copyright status of מקור חיים. If anyone knows anything about Israeli copyright law (or knows someone who knows) or knows someone in Israel who might be able to look into it, that would be a huge help in getting a translation project off the ground (or finding out if it's even possible).  Rav HaLevi died not that long ago, so it is possible that מקור חיים entered the public domain then or the copyright may have been extended.  Even if it remains under copyright, we might be able to secure permission as an open access, not for profit profit project.  Beyond that, I foresee the need to put together an editorial board to oversee the project, establish translation guidelines, and monitor/edit submissions.  Of course, somewhere must be found to host the wiki, and someone to act as admin for it.  Thoughts?

      Presently I'm trying to complete two papers left over from last fall semester before this fall semester starts: one on F.P. Ramsey and the Frege-Geach problem, and one on the compatibility of minimalism about truth, minimalism about truth aptitude, and expressivism in ethics.  The former has blown up on me once (last winter) and had a near meltdown recently.  The latter is a big job and, given that I'm making progress at a crawl, I doubt I'll be meeting my goal to finish it before September.  The problem is, as always, that having already had my bright idea, I am quite content with myself at that:  I  don't feel any great need to write it up.  (When the bright idea turns out to be not so bright after all, as in the Ramsey paper of last winter, I go from unmotivated to disillusioned.)  This grad school thing isn't going to work very well if I don't get beyond that.  Philosophy aside, big changes are afoot for my apartment: current flatmate, Mark, is soon off to do a Ph.D. in computer science at Penn; new flatmate, Mike, is coming to NYC to make a rabbi of himself at YCT.  We're still looking for a third to share the big room with Mike and lower my share of the monthly rent.  I think we have a promising prospect and should know for certain by the end of the week.  In any case, I intend the place to remain  all poshed out  whoever moves in.  Beyond all that, coming back to New York only to be cooped up in my apartment trying to do work after spending a month in Chicago with sun and lake views (thanks to Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and my mom) has induced serious bicycle cravings.  Please may my dad's old apartment get sold soon so I'll have the money for it... and an iBook.  I'm convinced they'd make for a healthier, happier, and more productive me.  If the iPod could do it, why can't they?
