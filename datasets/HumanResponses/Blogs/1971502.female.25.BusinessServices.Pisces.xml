      Time to get your crayons and your pencils!  Pictures of me! (Because everyone wants to look at me, right?)  I have a Yahoo Phot album that I update from time to time.  Just check out my member pofile. (nikknap)  urlLink http://us.f1.yahoofs.com/users/88c1de83/bc/Yahoo!+Photo+Album/e4ff.jpg?pftZcZABvzCE5Ruo   I've been obsessing over my weight again.  I really want to lose 15 more pounds.  Anyone with a good, healthy idea on how to do this is encouraged to fill me in.  I'm determined to exercise and get myself into swimming suit condition.  It's been so friggin long since I felt comfortable in a suit.  Part of the problem is the general flabby, mark-upped condition of my skin after giving birth to all those babies   and  getting so fat after I had Ayden.  I'm starting my first day at the Super 8.  Woo-Hoo.  I'm also meeting someone tonight who may work out to be a roommate.  Here goes!  Oh, and another poem for Trast  Untitled  Opinion ate ed- ible pears  because he didn't want to eat  dead animals and he thought dead barley had feelings, too.   (Line breaks provided by me.  I have no idea what he's talking about, here.  We had a discussion on opinions and opinionated people.  He brought up vegatarians.  I told him about vegans.  This was the result.)

      Post away, lads and lassies.  The lovely Sarah has joined (see below) and I am looking forward to hearing her thoughts.  She always has great movies and books to talk about.  She also thinks she's cynical, but has enough love in her to make the world she encompasses a bit better.    As for Mr. MacDougall, he'll probably never post because he doesn't love me enough to care.  Waaa.  Sob.  Boo-friggin'-Hoo.

      Hey, how's it goin'?  I have not heard from you for some time and was plesantly surprised to see that you are going to be blogging again.  I miss you and I have a few new movies and a book to recommend.  Movies:  "Gia" ( I think I already told you this one)  starring Angelina Jolie as real life super model from the early 80's.  She is beautiful and so sexy in this role.  The movie gripped me and was the start of a new obsession that I have with Gia.  "Party Monster" This one stars Macauley Culkin and Seth Green as NYC club kids.  It is based on the real life of super club kid Michael Ailing.  I love the story of his life, the stars are not actors that I like too much, but they did an ok job. I think that Michael Ailing will be another new obsession for me.   "Caturing the Friedmanns" This is a documentary about a family whose life was ripped apart by a child pornography scandal in 1988.  It was during the "boom" of child porn when police would arrest almost anyone without a shred of proof.  Were they guilty?  You decide, I have my doubts.  Fucked up family, yes, but guilty of all charges?  You be the judge.  The most interesting thing is that this movie started out as a documentary on NYC "career clowns", yes, people who actually make a living as clowns.  It turns out that the oldest Friedmann boy is a party clown, and during interviews for the clown documentary, his family history came out, and thus, the clown flick was scrapped and "Capturing the Friedmanns" was born.  "Heavenly Creatures" starring Kate Winslet.  I know, the chick from Titanic, it was enough to almost maker me not watch.  I wanted to see this b/c it was one of Peter Jackson's (of LOTR fame) first movies.  It is the true story of two New Zealand schoolgirls and the lengths that they will go to in order to be together.  Very disturbing.  Christopher saw the opening scenes, fell asleep and awoke for the ending scenes.  He was wondering what the hell I was watching.  After you see this, and take note of the first and last scenes, you will see  why he was a little confused.  I believe that it is pretty apparent that I have been on a true story kick recently. One last movie that was great is  "Rabbit-proof fence" about the fence that goes from one end of Austrailia to the other. This is the story of some incredible youngsters and what they endured just to be home.  If you see this on DVD, be sure to watch the making of.  It is just as good as the movie. The great book is "The joy of funerals" by Alix Strauss. It is short stories that seperate at first, but then woven together with the last story.  All the stories have elements of death and are so beautifully written you will want for more. One piece of good news here, my friends, Jody and Kevin, just found out that the book they co-wrote about a couple coping with breast cancer is being published.  Amazon picked it up and first edition will be in early May, 3,000 copies!  Yea for them!  :) I love you and miss you Nikol, hope you see the movies and read the book!

      How the hell do I explain to these children why the following is funny?;  Knock Knock Who's there? Cantalope Cantalope who? Cantalope, I'm already married.  I wasted a good 45 minutes trying to enlighten them on the subject of knock knock jokes.  It resulted in;  Knock Knock Who's there? Ayden Ayden who? Ayden CANTALOPE!  I remember when I tried to talk to Trast on the subject of "Why did the chicken cross the road?" and all other jokes along the same vein.  His response? Trast: Why did the chicken cross the road?  Because it wanted to die. Me: Why would it want to die? Trast: Why would it be by the road? Me: A chicken sure would have to be sad to want to die. Trast:  It's a chicken, mom.  Can I have a popsickle?

      I really want to open my own cafe.  It'll have ambiance, great food, fantastic coffee and tea and art art art!  The problem is I'm flat broke.  But why let that stop me?  I suggest that all sorts of rich people invest.  I've been thinking a lot about Milwaukee's upcoming mayoral election.  Why do I care?  It isn't as if I live there.  Kwabana, Muhib, Tiffani and DJ Vale have a way of reaching people, though.  They're all about Marvin Pratt.  I'd have to say that I agree with them there.  (Sorry, Dave)  Barret seems a bit too focused on building business in an area that already has an established business district.  I see this as doing nothing at all for the more depressed areas of the city.  When people think Milwaukee they usually picture a small, "nice" area and then a larger, industrial, hide your wallet and lock your car doors when you drive through area.  I think Pratt is more focused on changing that conception by bettering those neighborhoods.  I'm sure he has enough sense to see that one way to do that is to establish more jobs in those areas.  After all, he's the one that helped Mecca become what it is.   Trast's poem for the day:  Butt Towels  I like to poo Don't you? Never argue with the data your butt sends Never argue with your butt don't pretend that you do not have to go poop and make sure that the bathroom is  ready for you because it sucks when all the butt towels are gone.

      Okay, so my last blog was pretty spotty when it came to regular posts on my part.  It was crazy that people really read the last one.  It only encouraged me.  But, hey, I have things to say.  So, what is up in this 25 year old woman's life?  I live alone.  Yuck I think I found a job. The divorce in in progress. My kids are cute and cool. I am reading "Franny and Zooey" which was lent to me by David Jackson. I have an attractive, funny, intelligent, geeky poet boy.  He's cool.  He has a site that everyone should check out, especially if they need to hire a top notch programmer and pay him tons of money so he can get a new car. www.alanmacdougall.com I have great friends who will be montioned all over this blog.  Now, I'll do my little happy daily entry.

      I deserve a raise.  Last night at work we had a false fire alarm.  Munish had never dealt with that before and he had no idea how to get it turned off.  Not only was it loud and panic inducing for the "guests", but there was an inspector there giving the place a rating.  I also have never dealt with farm alarms, but I used my quick wit to asses the situation and made the horrible noise end!  Hooray!  I'm learning a bit about marketing.  I will make this job worth my time!

      In other, relevant news, I have another theory about the goings on of this wiley world we live in.  If any of you have been abreast of current events, you'll have seen and heard countless news stories about the movie "Passion of the Christ".  I'm not talking urban legend tripe.  I mean, actual news items in regards to the actions of people after seeing this flick.  There seem to be two schools of drastic response.  This is not saying that all people who have seen the movie have had these responses.  (I dunno, I haven't met or spoken with a single person who has seen it.  I don't want to go to it alone, or I'd give my first hand account.)  The first reaction seems to be one of anger.  Fights have broken out over this movie, and I'm not talking little fights.  I'm talking knife, gun, baseball bat and scissor involving fights.  The people involved in these fights are not just trailer dwelling, on Cops 5 times last week for domestic violence, always getting into trouble sort of people.  So, what gives?  What is making these people think it would be a good idea to shove scissors through hands?  The second reaction is one of repentance.  These are the people who robbed banks and committed murders that see this movie and turn themselves in.  You'd think it would be good enough to just ask the Lord for forgiveness and hope for your spot at Heaven's all you can eat buffet.  Nope, these cats are going straight to the police.  They're going to do time over something they already got away with.  I have to wonder about the stuff that doesn't make the news.  Dolores sees the movie and confesses to Jim that she's the one who ate his chicken sandwich from the employee fridge 2 years ago.  It could be happening, people.  "So, Nikol," you ask me, (you know you want to ask me), "what do you think is up with this movie?"  I'm glad you asked.  If you didn't, you should've, you lousy, no-goodkin.  I'm sad to have ever called you a friend! Get out of my blog! BWaaaaaaaargh!  Theory One (The Box Office Buy-out)  Mel Gibson has tons of money. (No, that isn't the theory, you dink.)  He could easily use his resources to buy these news stories.  Let me stress here that this is     not  about  URBAN LEGENDS  or their creation.  All you have to do in that case is start a rumor that you're sure others will pass on.  In most cases, these legends all get debunked rather quickly.  What I'm talking about is producing the news.  Perhaps I bought into "Wag the Dog" a bit too much, but this is different and even more possible than producing a war.  So, I'm thinking Mel's people (mind if I call him Mel?) have been using the news as their greatest form of advertisement.  Theory Two (Armageddon Here, I'll have a Large Popcorn, Extra Butter)  Perhaps these things are really happening!  If they are, we need to truly examine why this piece of gory entertainment is having this effect on people.  We all knew that it was going to be a movie about Jesus getting flogged and tortured.  We all knew that there was about to be some string of theological debate.  We all knew that some kook was going to say this it is our social responsibility to ban/watch this movie.  It would be a shame to turn a blind eye to this reaction as if we saw it coming.  So God and Satan are duking it out right now (and me without pay-per-view) by testing the strength of their followers.  Those on Beelzebub's team are moved to stabbing.  Those working for Yawe are confessing.  Or is it the other way around?  Who am I to say?  If you take a look around at the other thing that are going on right now, you'll see what I mean.  Janet Jackson was bleeped for saying "Jesus!" on David Letterman.  Everywhere you go you are bombarded by Christian Leaflets about the movie.  There was a little basket of them at a Subway last night that even invited me to go to a four part lecture series at a church discussing this movie.    A woman just began a trial for killing two of her children and seriously injuring a third because God asked her to.  This deserves it's own paragraph because taken alone, it's just another of those "religious crack pot" stories.  I find it interesting because she woke her kids one by one in the middle of the night and took them out to the yard.  She asked them each in turn to lay their heads on a large rock while she stood over them with a big, heavy stone in her hands and bashed their skulls in.  These were not babies.  (The baby is the only one who survived)  These children were 6 and 8 years old.  They knew mum was going to kill them.  They had to know.  They let her!  And I think the worst part is (Yeah, worse in my mind) the opening statement of her lawyer.  It was something to the effects of, "Should this woman listen to what she thinks to be right, or should she turn her back on God?"  Those are just examples of the craziness that is happening all over the world.  I could list for hours.  I think you'd prefer I didn't.  What's you opinion?  Oh, and just to be clear with everyone... I'm mostly joking.  You know, creative writing.

      At first I thought Nader was looking rather rough.  I saw him on the television box at work.  I only got a small glimpse, though.  Munish was trying to show me what channel HBO was in case people called the front desk to ask.  I saw this man UP CLOSE not even 4 years ago.  Ayden, Mitch, Trast and I went to a Nader rally.  I made a sign with Nader's head on a Kermit the Frog body that said, "It's so easy being green".  Personally, I voted for Harry Brown, but I wanted to hear Michael Moore and Nader speak.  Nader looked like your average older man.  He's kind of ugly, but physically he seemed to be holding his own.  I'd go so far as to say he looked good.  If any of you have seen recent footage or pictures of Nader, you'll know that dude is looking haggard and only vaguely like himself.  It's terrible.  His entire face is gaunt, but sagging!  His nose looks like it's about to drop right off of his face.    The first (and obvious) thought I had was that perhaps aliens sucked the life out of him and are using his body.  The second is that the GOP got to him first.  They killed and zombified him and are using him to do their bidding.  Hey, it could be the Democrats.  What do we   really  know about Kerry?  Could he have evil powers?  Is Nader going to burst into the song, "I've Got No Strings" at his next appearance?  Then it dawned on me!  Perhaps the  real  Nader is bound and gagged somewhere, maybe dead, maybe only barely hanging on to his life.  Perhaps some darker enemy is masquerading as Nader.  Look at the photos, I beg you!  Could this man be Sadaam?  You have to admit, there is some resemblance.  I am gathering evidence!  Check back here regularly.  I'll send a sign to all of those with me once I am ready to confront this poor look a like.  If I disappear suddenly, you all know that I was right!

      Below is an articel that was written about a presentation that the Wasteland Poets did at  Catholic High School in Wheaton, IL.  I'm a bit resentful at the mention of myslef as a "former beauty queen".  Why do people drag this shit out to focus on?  But I had a good laugh at the stuff I was quoted as saying.      Poetic license   Wasteland Poets provide St. Francis with new understanding of genre   By Tim Waldorf staff writer    Wasteland poet Dale Ritterbusch, a creative writing and literature professor at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, stood in an auditorium half-filled with hand-selected St. Francis High School students March 9, and he encouraged them to sing with him as he recited "Great Green Gobs of Greasy Grimy Gopher Guts" during a portion of the school's Poetry Jam '04.   Ritterbusch said he had tried this once while giving a poetry presentation to his daughter's elementary school class, but his daughter's teacher disapproved.   "What she was suggesting, really, was that there was a proper language and subject manner for poetry," Ritterbusch told the students, "and greasy, grimy gopher guts was not it."   Obviously, Ritterbusch disagreed, and he didn't hesitate to tell the group why. He said so many people are tied to "this conservative understanding of what poetry should be." Changing that understanding was the goal of the Wasteland Poets — a group of accomplished Wisconsin poets featuring Ritterbusch, "gypsy wanderer" Liz Hammond, "gutsy single mom" Anjie Greene-Martin, and "former beauty queen" turned artist Nikol Knapmiller.   "Poetry at every level is not taught quite as well as it should be," Ritterbusch said. "And, by they way, those traditional (poetry) anthologies are boring at the college level, too."   Many are filled with perfectly fine poetry, he said, but poetry that doesn't deserve the kind of exaltation that it receives anymore. The language used and the subjects addressed just don't impact readers these days, he said.   "Poetry is supposed to have some impact on the reader, and if it doesn't do that, it really isn't poetry," he said.   "It better evoke some kind of response from your readers other than putting them to sleep," he later added.   The group recited some of its work as examples, and then provided the students with writing challenges as they broke into small groups to compose a poem or two of their open before an open mike segment.   Earlier in the jam, so many students read poems they had written about how some didn't really know them. Knapmiller challenged the students to flip that around, explore themselves, and write about what people do know about them.   Greene-Martin asked students about a person in their life in a poem starting with the phrase "I remember," and Hammond encourage students to write an eavesdropping poem — one in which the first line was an overheard comment. Ritterbusch requested that they simply write about the most recent argument they had with their parents — a popular theme among the poets.   "It seems like every poet up here has an angry mom poem," Knapmiller said. "You don't have to be mad at your mom to be a poet. It just helps."   James Wall, a creative writing professor at St. Francis, organized the jam — an invitation-only event in which he selected upperclassmen from his courses. English teachers also recommended freshmen and sophomores they thought could gain from the experience. More than 100 took part in the event.   "And they're not all A students, either," he said. "I was looking for students with a creative spark. Students who could gain from the experience."   While poetry is always studied in school, poetry writing, he said, is sometimes put on the back shelf in favor of more traditional college preparatory practices — like the famed five-paragraph essay. But the five-paragraph essay doesn't nurture creativity quite like poetry does, he said.   "And the idea of creativity is just so darned important," Wall said.   While his students' efforts primarily focus on such themes as the high school social scene and the pleasures of growing up in suburbia, Wall said they will grow into better poets if they persevere.   "They have to live," he said. "They have to go out and get lives."   For now, though, Wall is working with them to create an anthology for the school. Set for distribution in April, the anthology will include 60 poems and one short story, and it will be titled "The Righters."   "Because they create stuff that makes society right," Wall said.

      No more weight dropping for now.  Until I can get a healthier, more accurate image of my size I will conentrate (not obsess) on getting in good physical shape.  This may mean that I will have to eat more calories per day.  Good thing I love avacados.  Those babies pack a whompin' 360 calories per fruit.  I started at the Super 8 and it's okay.  I have a habit of focusing on any place a work to try and make it the best damn place to work ever.  I've laready let Munish in on a few decorating ideas that I have.  Next I'm going to work on making the Continental Breakfast a bit better.  I met Sourabh.  I suppose he  may  still be roommate potential.  We had a good time until things got a little haywire, but we talked it through.  The problems I can see arising are  a.) I need time to myself.  He doesn't seem to want to accept that.  (He stayed the night and was there well into the next afternoon.)  I tried to get my alone time in there and he wouldn't leave me alone.  We talked and talked and talked and talked until my jaw hurt from all the talking.  I've determined that small talk is good at times.  I don't mind having deep conversations with people, but I'd like to limit their duration and instill a policy of "No Existentialism Before Breakfast".  b.) He likes me.  I mean he    likes me .  If I passed him the 2nd grade note, he'd circle YES three times and highlight it.  It's good to like your roommate.  It isn't good to want a relationship from them.  That only leads to trouble.    So, there it is.  G'day all.

      The first day of pain is here.  I don't know how to cope with this.  I can't go ten minutes without blubbering wildly.  I'll spare you all the details and just say that I have no fucking clue how to make this work out, nor do I own the oomph it takes to do it.  For the moment I am feeling fatalistic and morbidly depressed.  If I have any friends out there who aren't sick of my bullshit melodrama, now would be a great time to step into the light.  I'm grasping here, folks.  Life is not good.    I really wish someone were around to take care of me.  I need to be taken care of right now.  If I weren't such a lousy person, perhaps I'd have a plethera of options in that field.  I did this shit to myself.    The world is not going to become a better place.  I'm so deep in the darkness that I was listening to "My Immortal" and staged in my head as a song sung to myself.   Fuck fuck fuck.  I am one stressed out lady. S. O. S.

      My kids are hilarious.  Here's a mental image that I'm hoping will make you all smile:  We put in the Chicago soundtrack and jumped around the living room singing and dancing.  Ayden played Billy pretty well as he sang, "All I Care About is Love".  Trast and I had a go about who got to play Roxi.  I finally gave in and let him, but on the condition that I got to play Velma and Momma.  It was fun.  They got a real rise out of me singing, "There's a lotta favors I'm prepared to do.  You do one for momma, she'll do one for you." Then Trast dug out the blonde wig for his rendition of "Funny Honey".  All three of us danced wildly to "Both Reached for The Gun."  I'm so glad I spawned such hammy boys.

       urlLink Wow, I wish I were fun   Seriously, though, I think I'm okay today.  Well, Pratt didn't win.  Too bad, really.  History could've been made.  Milwaukee does need to pump up it's interracial image.  If all of those people who were unsure would've looked past any of the dirt Barret's people dug up, things may have ended differently.  There's dirt to be had on anyone.  'Cept Jeebus.  I'm not expressing any hate for Barret, though.  He'll do more of the same old for Milwaukee, I'm sure.  He also has a decent stache.  I'm still gathering photos of Ralph.  Please send any odd news articles my way!  Look expressly for articles in which Ralph says things such as, "I am just a shell" or any of the following words/phrases: aliens ovipositor no more recycling destroy the earth vote Republican my skin is slipping off  Yipee!  I just got a lot of CD's in the mail.  "Chicago" soundtrack Ella Fitzgerald "The Ballads Adam Ant "Wonderful" DJ RAP "Learning Curve" Sonic Youth "A Thousand Leaves" Marcy Playground Simpsons "The Yellow Album" Blues Explosion "Mo' Width" LARD "Pure Chewing Satisfaction" Primus "Frizzle Fry" The Reverend Horton Heat "It's Martini Time" Mr Bungle "California" Mike Patton "Adult Themes for Voice" Oingo Boingo "Boingo Alive" Pixies "Come on Pilgrim"  Tons of listening enjoyment!  Yay!

      If anyone can tell me how they manage to do it, I'd be ever so grateful.  (and fat)  It just isn't right for cookies to be that soft and tastey.  Speaking of tasty, the Korean food was delicious.  On the menu almost everything climed to have been cooked in a tasty sauce.  I chuckled over that until I put in in my mouth.  I'm so glad to have a boy like Alan.  You know, for tons of reasons.  In this case I mean because he can take the same delight in really good food.  I've still been dreaming of bunnies.  Evil bunnies suck.  Last night I had a brown rabbit cross my path.  Then the thing just sat and stared at me.  It wanted to come after me like my ankle was made of carrots.  I'm sure of it.  Twitchy beast.

      She took a tiny nap, woke up feeling much better, and we went to a Korean restaurant. They had some really good kimchee made from radishes, spinach, sprouts, and potatoes as well as the traditional cabbage; and the proprietress showed us how to eat our moderately-exotic food. (The bul-go-ki is Atkins-friendly by default: you wrap the meat in lettuce, dab on some soy paste, and chow down.)  Too bad about the poetry, though.

      At least this isn't that post where I'm all chipper.  I have to admit that if I wanted to restore my faith in poetry, Thai Joe's was not the place to do it.  God, it drove me mad to the point that on the ride home I ripped a stack of my poems in half.  I don't regret it.  I'm very sad today.  I guess I am feeling kind of alone.  Very sleepy, too.  Matter of fact, I do believe I'll take a tiny nap before going home.  Loving people is not all it's made out to be.  And in the words of Amy Rae,  "Learn to pretend there's more than love that matters."

      I had yet another interview today with HQ Global.  They sure do love interviewing me.    I am not going to say a word of regret about the last post.  I still feel all of that.  The positive thing is that I do not always feel like dung.  Most of the time I am quite happy with the world because I have family and friends that understand me.  When they don't understand me, they love me anyway.

          There was an infestation of college aged lacrosse players at the Super 8 last night.  Scary.  BOYS!  I am proud of myself for resisting flirt temptation.  (Okay, I did flirt a little, but I didn't take up any invites.)  Not that Alan would have cared.  I hate that.  Why can't I have one of those uber jealous boys who punches holes in the wall and casts glowering looks at any man who comes near me?  Yeah.  That'd be zesty.  Really, it would just make me feel like less of a bitch for all of my jealousy.    I have another interview tomorrow.  I'm so very tired of interviews.  I want to just go in there and say, "Listen, I'm going to be the best damn thing that's going to happen to your company.  You won't know that until you hire me, though.  That's all I have to say.  Call me or don't call me.  Whatever you do, don't send me a form letter.  It wastes paper."  And what is with people who don't leave messages?  What the hell is the point of having voice mail if people aren't going to use it?  Instead I get random numbers on my caller i.d. and no idea why they are calling.  Pisses me right off, it does.  I think I'm going to give up on my writing for good.  I was reading some of my poems and realized how self-indulgent poetry is.  I HATE POETRY.  You heard me.  I abhor it.  I no longer want to stand in front of a group of people who are pretending to listen.  I no longer want to sit and force myself to smile and clap when I hear something that I know is crap.  True, the good stuff gets me excited.  I love it when a person finds a way to say something in a fresh, new way.  I'm just weary of the fucking flora and fauna bullshit.   Wow.  I'm just going to go to my room and not come out until I have something nice to say.

      6 am has a smell to it that I don't want to memorize.  If it is a smell you are waking up to, I suppose it's pleasant.  It does not welcome sleep, however.  This is going to take some adjusting to.

      I had a really good time last night.  The reading was amazing.  I still prefer an atmosphere like Rising Tides where it feels a bit more intimate.  Lyrical Sanctuary had rows of chairs lined up and lots of lighting on the mic area.  That always makes me feel shaky.  I had to read off of a piece of paper that I had ripped in two.  I threw a bit of a tantrum last week and ripped a huge stack of poetry up.  Yes, I'm melodramatic.  Thalia is really cool.  She's tall and pretty and talented and intelligent,  She sang a little bit of a song she wrote.  It gave me chills.  She's damn good.

      This is a post just for you, Steve.  You're creeping me out with your cute little antics.  I hate the word "stalker", but man!  You better take a good look at your behavior and get a fucking grip!  Maybe you need a support group.  I hate to be a bitch, but when I'm good at something, I stick with it.  So, here goes...  STOP looking at my on-line profile which gave you the link to this very blog.   STOP looking at this blog. STOP looking at me in on-line personal ads. STOP reading Alan's log. STOP referring to Alan at all. STOP wishing harm upon me or anyone I'm close to. STOP looking my name up in various on-line search engines that give you personal information about me. STOP sending me pathetic, "I love you" instant messages.  I long ago removed you from my buddy list.  Take my lead. STOP acting like I murdered your puppy because I don't want your creepy hands on me. STOP STOP STOP  Don't make me hate you, okay?  Until recently I just felt kind of bad for you.  While we worked together I couldn't stand it.  Each shift with you was about as bearable as Barney singing friendly songs to me as I'm getting a root canal.  So I quit, Steve.  I quit so I'd never have to look at your pathetic face again.  I quit so I didn't have to deal with your anger.  I quit so I didn't have to feel your hands reaching towards me to caress me innocently when I was having a bad day.  I quit so I'd never have to be cornered in the cooler by you again.  I'd sure appreciate it if you'd drop your stricken, "Poor boy in love with an evil woman" act and never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever think of me or contact me again.  Crystal clear, buddy?  Good.   Now, do you see that little X up in the right hand corner, or are the tears clouding your wittle eyes too much?  All you need to do now is click on that and I promise you, everything will be just fine.  I'd hug you, but--- nah.  I wouldn't hug you at all. See, I'm damn good at being a bitch.

      I don't know why I called you guys stinky chickens.  I just did.  Forgive me.  I was just thinking about "Franny and Zooey".  I don't know why I had never read it before.  I really enjoyed Salinger's other stuff.  Well, I've read it now and I am not disappointed in the least.  I've been so depressed, you know.  So I start reading this book and in true Salinger style it features a character having a bit of a nervous breakdown.  At the point of discovering this I'm thinking that I maybe should stay away from this book for a bit.  You know, in the same way I decided to step away from the Plath.  Still, I was up.  It was late.  I needed to read something and my copy of "Feminism and Philosophy" wasn't quite cutting it.  I'm glad I finished it.  It would make a lovely one act play and it ends optimistically.  Sort of.  I mean, it gives you a reason to do things.  Granted, the reason is "...for the Fat Lady" and Zooey enlightens us that the Fat Lady is everyone.  It had an impact.  Read it, if you haven't.  Though I'm sure I'm one of the only people in the world with half a brain and two working eyes who hasn't.   So, the night progressed with more puking.  Plenty of that!  Trast continued to be a jerk about it.  Ayden just wanted some love, but Trast kept saying, "Stay away!  You'll puke on me."  He even refused to give Ayden a drink of his water because Ayden might puke in it.  Grrr.  So I got puked on instead.  I don't know that I'm a very intelligent woman at times.  You know, when my reaction to my kid puking in the hallway is to hold out my hands to catch it.  Or how about when I know that when he says, "Mom!  My belly hurts!  Please hold me." it means that as soon as I pick him up I'm going to have a stinky mess of my hands.  (Literally)

      Wow.  I managed almost six years of never gettting vomitted on by my children.  In an effort to make up for lost time, Ayden decided it was a good idea to coat me in a lovely pea-green color this afternoon.  I thought it was odd when he just decided to lay down on the couch and sleep, but he's been goign through a growth spurt.  Then he woke up and said, "I'm too tired to walk to the bathroom."  Five minutes later he started sobbing and said, "I'm laying down, but my belly still hurts!"  I had no sooner put him on my lap and given his back a tiny pat when the gush of terrible warm green was running all over me, Ayden and the couch.  Trast was no help as he held his dainty freckled nose and told Ayden to knock it off.  Hey, I'm so glad my kiddos are getting a public   urlLink education

      Hola.    So, I have a "date" (sorta) with a lovely person on Wednesday night.  I'm taking her to a poetry reading.  Chicks dig that sort of thing.  At least they better.  I've already told Alan not to cock block.  She's absolutely beautiful and her name is Thalia, but she goes by Thals.  She's not looking for a serious relationship (Thank GOD!) which leaves me optimistic.    Super 8 stuff is going well.  I start the marketing bit tomorrow.

      I want to go.  He says "stay". This is an excerpt from an e-mail he sent me once.  I said in an e-mail that I hoped he was enjoying the movie he was at...  >The more I talk to you, the more special you become. You're a G-class star, soft and yellow, in a solar system where your children rest in that sweet spot, only a few million miles wide, in which life can thrive. If I'm lucky, I'm a comet, sweeping through once to shake off a tail of burning hydrogen ice and leave meteor sparkles in your corona; then it's off into the interstellar void for another fifty years. How can good acting and amazing special effects  compete for my adoration? > >But the orcish war elephants were pretty badass.  He's also a spelling and grammar nazi.

      When I put my time into something, I would like to make sure it lasts.  Pardon me for putting that in here.  Now urlLink laugh   Take a job, for instance.   If you go into it with the idea that you're only going to do it for a short time, you're more likely to muddle your way through.  It's easy to enjoy it while you have it because you know it'll be over soon.  It'll be a new experience.  No worries invloved. If you go into it thinking you'll be there for a longer time you're more likely to ensure you love it by expending lots of energy making it your own.  You worry about the things that go wrong, yet take great delight in the things that go well.  You find ways to get through the rough spots because it's worth it to you.  As for myself, I've lived a lot for my 25 years.  I can't say I'm especially wise.  In a lot of ways I'm just a kid.  But I have transcended the time when I can just live for the happiness of the moment with the idea that when things get unpleasant in any situation, it'll just be time to move on.  I'm looking for less hit points.  I'm looking for less experience points.  The only points I wish to increase right now are skill points.  However, I know that without the first two I mentioned, my skill points will stay the same.  I'm no longer afraid that I'm going to be alone forever.  Oddly enough, I now know that with all the people out there in the world, I'm bound to find a person who values me on a similar level that I value them.  As far as I'm concerned, I know someone who likes me a hell of a lot.  I feel the same.  We just need to iron out some of the wrinkles in our theories on life and love so that they can peacefully co-exist.   BUT  I also don't want to dump time into anything that just ends one day because it isn't good 90% of the time.  I'm more willing to go with the 70% mark.  I know enough about friendship and realtionships to see the reality in that.

      In King of Fighters '95, when your super meter is maxed, you get a variety of benefits; among them is the ability to "guard-cancel." It's easy to do: you take a hit, block it, and during your block-stun you simply execute the move. Instead of sitting through the rest of the block-stun, you instantly retaliate for a guaranteed hit.  This concept shortly began to appear in other games (and for all I know, KOF95 wasn't the first). In Street Fighter Alpha, you could "Alpha Counter," which guard-canceled into a knockdown. In King of Fighters 96 and on, you could guard-cancel into rolls or heavy attacks. SFA aside, the guard-cancel remains largely the province of the SNK side of the fence&#8212;I could name a few non-SNK games that have it, but when you think of guard-cancels, you think King of Fighters.  If you're a middle-aged-school gamer (somewhere between Street Fighter Championship and Tekken II), you remember "Combo Breakers" from Killer Instinct. These, like most things about KI, were practically an unintentional parody of much better games: imagine suffering through a combo and thinking "make it stop! Dear God, make the pain end!" Well, Combo Breakers let you do that. Strictly for scrubs, you say? True; but then, KI's combos were strictly for scrubs in the first place.  Of course, the definition of the term "scrub" varies from skillset to skillset. Super hardcore SF3 fans will call you a scrub if you so much as jump, or fail to parry every hit of a shinkuu hadouken. Me, I call you a scrub if you mash more than you tap, and leave it at that. Nikol is a good poet, and she's cute. Note to Cyclops players: I include Mega Optic Blast in my anti-mashing stricture. Have you  really  seen it add more than a few pixels of damage? Is the lack of cool really worth it?

      I forgot to mention that Trast turned six on Saturday.  Life's been a whirlwind.  I am riding a constant up and down over here.  It's like my body is staging a revolution against me.

      Here's where I divulge some shit.  It's a nice day and my insides are feeling a little bit better, so I can handle this...  There is a reason I have to make dire situations funny.  There is a reason i like the most fucked up, depressing movies I can find.  There is a reason I enjoy listening to songs that make me cry.  All of this shit makes me urlLink happier  for some reason.  So, i've got these people thinking I'm morbid or pessemistic.  I was just told a minute ago that I hate everything.  That isn't true at all.  I'm an optimist and I love a lot of things.  I love a lot of people, too.    Now, don't get me wrong.  I'm about to say a thing or two that may seem trite.  I have no disillusions about how fucking annoying my moodiness can be, nor do I claim to be the most together person in the world.  I know I do and say things that are hard for my friends to deal with.  I obsess over my body.  I do things that aren't very good for me.  I have a tendency to be self-destructive at times and the rest of the time I have no regard for my safety.  I seem to seek out things and situations that could be harmful, or I at least don't avoid them.  I leave my curling iron on all the time even though it's a fire hazard, for example.  I say I smoke in hopes of dying from cancer at an early age.  It can be frustrating.  But, c'mon!  Cut me some slack.  I'm more together than I have a right to be.  I've pulled myself out of more messes than can be counted.  I have a reserve of strength for the times when I need it.  I was once told that I'm not strong enough all of the time.  Well, babies, that's shit.  I am super strong when I need to be and it saps me the rest of the time.  I think I'm well entitled to the moments when I have little break downs and can't get out of bed.  I need to let it out sometimes.  The fact that I'm not stark raving mad and locked away has to be enough at times.    I'm not about to go over every rotten thing that happened to me because there has been too much.  I know, I know.  I should just be happy that I have my health and there are plenty of people who are worse off than i am.  I've been hearing that plenty since I was a mere 5 years old.  I'm sick of hearing it.  I want a little allownace to say that I've seen more shit in my life than most people ever will.  It's hard for me to say it, but it is the truth.  So the next time I get weepy and sad for seemingly no reason, keep in mind that I may be strong, but I still have a lot to deal with.

      He was activated.  That means putting a plan together, then waiting to see if it happens.    Rising Tides was utterly fantastic last night!  It started out pretty small, but even with just a few of us we made some noise.  The poets were on, Joanne only did one song (phew), some new poets were there and the feature was Adaugo.  She is so amazing.  When Thals and I saw her at Lyrical Sanctuary I made it a point to introduce her.  I forgot that she said she'd be featuring at Rising Tides.  She did an awesome set, as usual.  After her set the energy was even higher than before.  A bunch of people showed up and blessed the mic.  Kwabana, Asterisk, Life and Pyramid did their thing.  Then Alan got up there and invoked something amazing.  He started singing just a silly little blues song.  It was funny.  But we kept it up.  One after one, people were getting up there and singing/speaking the blues.  Adaugo sang Billie Holiday style until she ran out of words.  Then she said she had the "been drinking vodka blues".  It all ended with Joshua the Scribe (what a great guy) getting up there to sing the "Happies" because he was just so damn happy he couldn't sing the blues.  I looked around and I saw that everyone in the room was feeling it, too.  We were one happy group.  Afterward everyone mingled and talked and hugged.  I don't mind when those people hug me.  I usually hate hugs.  They seem impersonal and pointless.  I think I'm going soft in my old age.

      The phone rings.  It's Sergeant Chance from Alpha Company 2-128 Inf asking for Mitch.  Second call today.  He asks me if he can call Mitch at work.  Sure thing.   Again  Mitch is asked to volunteer to be activated with a sister batallion.  Again, Mitch says no deal.  Then the Sarge asks an odd question.  "Will you agree to be involuntarily mobilized for activation?" "Uh, no." yadayadayada "Any questions?" "Yes, sir.  What is the difference between volunteering and agreeing to be invoultarily activated?" "We've been asking ourselves the same question all day."   Hoo-AH   Gotta love the army.

      Hola, I'm posting this because Nikol made me.  She scared the shit out of me.  Her voice deepened and...um...um...that's all I could tell had happened 'cause we were on the phone, but I'm sure that alot more happened.... I don't think I've ever been more frightened of something so small since a swarm of daddy long legs attacked me while I was camping at Bong.  I'm over that though.  *twitch twitch*  I have good news for someone...anyone:  I have a 3-5 page paper due on the fight techniques (comparing and contrasting) of 2 or more films or plays of my choice.  You guys can feel free to submit examples (riiight...examples) of what my paper should include and how it should be formatted.  I think it would be best if you included everything except your name.  Well, that's all.  Have a good night!!

      Work work work!  I am too delicate for such tripe.  The status?  Subway is pretty cool.  I work with decent people.  They are fun and nice, but they also work really hard.  It seems that most of the employees there are good at their jobs and focus on work while there.  They joke around and have a good time, but they know how to do that as they work.  That means no one person is running around trying to do everything and getting pissed about it.  Also, I am not encountering any problems with being hired as a manager.  Everyone is happy with what they do there, so any questions I have get answered without eye rolling.  Oh, and they like me and tell me what a good job I am doing.  Nera, the owner, inserts things like, "I am so very glad you are here.  Now I know I don't have to worry about my store while I am not here."  Her husband also likes me and says he wants to make me feel happy there because I am a smart girl and hard worker.  As for Sub-Par 8, I need to insert an EEEEEEEK!  Holy shit.  I am getting a bit frustrated there.  I am constantly being given contradictory orders from the same damn people.  "Do all the laundry, no matter what."  Next day, "You did the last load as only half.  That will ruin the inside of the washing machine.  If there is half a load left, leave it there."  Next day I get there and get a note telling me to make sure I wash the cleaning rags.  Uh oh.  I see that there is only half a load of rags.  What to do?  Well, I'll just have to put half cleaning rags and half towels in to make a full load.  Next day, "You cannot wash rags with towels."  "But, there was only half a load of rags."  "You can do a half a load of rags.  It's okay."  Hmmmmm  Furthermore, I am not so happy about their business practices.  I don't think I can post here about  exactly  what I mean on that level.  I can relate a few stories.    One is that on Saturday night a couple came in for their room.  The computer had the charge of $89.00 listed.  I wrote it on their folio slip.  Then they pulled out a piece of paper where the price given to them on the Super 8 web site listed the room as $79.00.  I changed the price for them.  When I got into work on Sunday Munish was pissed.  I explained what happened.  He said, "All the area hotels were full on Saturday.  They couldn't have left.  You should have kept the ten dollars on there."  Grr.  That isn't right.  But then he tried to justify.  "You see, Nikol, for 6 months of the year we have almost no money at all coming in.  In the spring we start to get business again.  We need to make this business pay for all year long."  Okay.  Fine.  I will keep this in mind.    The phone rings.  It is a woman who wants to block 10 rooms for four nights in July.  One of those nights is pretty full, but I spend a good half an hour working magic and blocking those rooms for her.  I let her know she'll have to cancel a month in advance if she chooses not to stay with us.  I give her no quoted price because she doesn't ask for one.  I'm feeling pretty good about the lump of money I am making for my employer and this woman is happy.  She says she needs more rooms, so please call if anything else opens up.  More money!!!!  Munish returns from dinner with his family.  I tell him about the booking.  He is happy.  Then he looks at the woman's name.  A few minutes later he calls up to the desk and says, "You need to call this woman back and tell her we are full at that time."  Whaaaah?  "Those people stay here every year and they always want their senior discount."  Hmm.  So?  "We do not want them to stay here.  You need to call them now."  So I offer the solution that I call her back and tell her that the rooms are a solid $74.00 a night for all 10 rooms, all 4 nights of their stay due to the high traffic of that time period.  Not an option.  I had to call her back and cancel her reservations.  Maybe I shouldn't care, but for someone who is so concerned about retaining business and giving his Super 8 a new image, that's just shitty.  As for life beyond work...  The roommate search is still on.  I'm meeting a potential on May 7th.  It's another guy.  Guys are the only ones who respond to my stinkin on-line ad.  I'm not going to get my hopes up anymore.  He may just turn out to be another lonely creep who wants to touch my goodies. I have a reading coming up with the Wasteland Poets on May 1st in Waukesha.  It may be one of our most well attended, based on all the e-mails I've been getting from people I don't even remember.  They come across the site somehow and e-mail me.  Nifty, huh?  The poet Ramon (this 80 year old who recently responded to Alan by writing his own "rap") fell off a ladder and broke his hip.  That sucks because he and his wife lend an air to the readings that makes everyone feel good.  I'm looking forward to seeing Anjie and Dale.  I don't think Liz is going to be there.  I am working so much that I don't have much of a personal life right now.  Alan is doing temp work at Western States, so he can't come visit me.  Thalia is working through the next 10 days.  She may be able to get to the reading, though.  I hope she can.  I need to point out right here how exceptionally cool she is.  Not only is she beautiful, but she's incredibly funny, open and honest.  Sarah and I need to get together  soon .  She sent me an invite to her Stampin' Out party, but I am working that night.    On a final note, I saw someone today that I hadn't seen in a few years.  Chief Nubauer of the Palmyra PD.  I have detested that bastard for some time.  It was strange, though.  He's lost a good chunk of weight.  For some reason, seeing him so much thinner (the guy was a barge) made me feel like being nice to him.  I wonder what that was about.  I even told him that he looks great.  I doubt I'd say the same if he were taking me in again!  Okay, I think that's it.  I know, it was a lot to read.  I bet you skimmed.  Skimmer.

      I keep giving this guy a hard time.  Why is that?  I honestly think I'm going to catch him doing something wrong, or worse that I'm not going to catch him and one day he's just going to say, "Here's the woman I'm going to marry.  You and I can still do it, though."  I think it's time I am through with all that shit.  If he wanted another girl to keep, he'd just get rid of me.  And why would he want one?  I'm a good girl to have.  Yeah, we're going to be fine.

      Ayden Story __________ When presented with questions intended to calm him down before bed, the three year old gets awfully Zen.  So, Ayden, what is the sound of one hand clapping?  Ayden picks up your hand so that it is alone in a clapping postion.  Then he claps his own hands over yours.  That is it.  That is the sound of one hand clapping.  Is this the silliness of a child?  He didn't laugh about it.  It was his serious answer to a serious question.  People need eachother and can accomplish seemingly impossible feats by working together.  Now clean the puke off of your chin.  I promise that I'll never be this sappy again.

      I recently sent out an e-mail to a bunch of people telling them about my new job and asking in jest for creative ways to quit my other jobs.  I'm sorry to report that my friends are obviously a bunch of dullards with exception of a slim few.  I got countless advice to just give the standard notice and be truthful about my reason for leaving.  Yeah, thanks.  I think you folks misunderstood the assignment.  I know how to professionals quit and that's how I did it.  I just wanted funny ideas on how to quit.  Two funny suggestions were made and I will here note them as well as their sources.  Pale is a very good friend of mine and has been since 1997.  We both lived in Carbondale at the time and he hosted an open mic that was a huge part of my college life.  He now lives in Chicago and is very happily shacked up with Eric, who he calls his "Splenda Daddy".  He works at a pet store and isn't totally thrilled about it.  He said that I should set up a meeting with my boss in said boss's office.  I should take a laxative about half an hour before the meeting, then march into the office, place the following week's schedule on the desk, climb up there and take a big shit on the schedule.  Thanks, Pale!  You're really good at this sort of thing.  I alerted the pet store to avoid any meetings you call with them.  John is someone who I will be meeting up with soon as a potential roomy.  It seems promising thus far as he understands that the room is for rent, not me.  We're e-mailing back and forth in order to get to know one another.  His suggestion was that I tell Super 8 and Subway that I need to quit in order to continue my work of making an ass impression on my couch.  So, there they are.  To the rest of you, tsk tsk!  You claim to be such a creative bunch!  Any other ideas are welcome, either by e-mail or directly posting here.

       1. It is important that a man helps you around the house and has a job.      2. It is important that a man makes you laugh.     3. It is important to find a man you can count on and doesn't lie to you.      4. It is important that a man loves you and spoils you.      5. It is important that these four men don't know each other.       I found that cute.  It's usually not my brand of humor, but eh.

      I'm reading this great book and wanted to share a bit I found lovely.   "See, that's what I just told you a minute ago, Zayde.  You don't need no big reasons to love a woman.  The size of the love has nothing to do with the size of the reason.  Sometimes one word she says is enough.  Sometimes only the line of the hip, like a poppy stem.  And sometimes it's the way her lips look when she says "seven" or "thirteen".  Once I even said to her, 'Judith, how much is three and four?' just to see the seven on her mouth.  And sometimes, listen Zayde, sometimes jut the eyebrows of a woman can grab a man for a whole life."

It does make me wonder about some things.  If I post right here that Trast is my son and that Trast is a cutey, will these things show up?  I also had an idea.  It occured to me that people regularly google their names.  What if I post a list of names in the log of people I have been trying to reconnect with?  Will they google their names and see this site.  I think over the next few weeks I'll try it.  Like....  Amanda Graham Leila Hagshenas John Neely Neil Arsenty

      He leaves June 15 and will be gone for about two years.  For now, this poem is my only response.  Yes, I know the sappy factor of the final line.   Doves  There are things that the body doesn’t know The eyes don’t see  And even the hand frying his eggs Gently prodding the yolks Cannot predict  Like the dove, who never assumed to Be a representative of peace And fights to the death over her nest Never knowing of the hurricane That in a week’s time will prove her fight ineffective  I fought that battle More viciously than any dove  And for two long years  My young flew without me For two long years I pecked at the system I pruned my damaged feathers I brought mud and twigs to my marriage  I dug my tiny talons in- Twisted the world around And from the cage  Of the county jail I sang so loud and resilient That I brought my nest back together  But there are things that the body doesn’t know The eyes don’t see And even the hands pouring his coffee Scribbling their lunch money checks Could not predict  The hurricane rumbled out of my pores With the rain came the removal of the wedding ring With the winds came the battle of custody With the hail came visitation schedules And finally the lighting called him to war Threatening to burn down the tree  Home to the already fraying nest  There are things that the body doesn’t want to know The eyes won’t look to see And even the hands that help to pack his things Will not predict But for his safety The heart can hope.

      Scottish Fest was enjoyable.  Alan did fine.  The kids were okay after...  We got there and realized that the admission prices were fairly high which made buying extras for the boys impossible.  Ayden seemed okay with this, but Trast got especially whiny and mean.  Alan took Ayden somewhere and I sat Trast down to explain to him that I could not afford to get the sword that he so wanted.  The result was heart break and tears which did not cease.  I held him for a few minutes while he sobbed, but he didn't stop.  I began to look for Alan and Ayden, but didn't see them.  I had no clear idea how much area the festival encompassed and I still had seen no sign of John, so I stood there getting angry and wanting to cry along with Trast.  Finally I saw John making his way towards us.  A few minutes later Alan and Ayden showed up.  Ayden was upset because Alan accidentally pushed him off of the swings.  So Ayden was running, I was running after him, Trast was running after me and everyone else looked on.  Once I got them to stand still John and his friends were nowhere to be seen.  I was just to the point of disbelieving that I had to pay admission for hell when John, Ned, and Ryan reappeared with swords AND helmets.  Ned is a nice guy, indeed, and my hero for the day.  On the way home the boys and I had a lengthy discussion about step parents.  They had many questions.  I answered as best I could.  Then Trast came up with a list of men I could marry in order for him to have multiple fathers.  Yikes to that.  Now I need to get Ayden out of the tub and help Trast get through this level of Super Mario Brothers.

      Roomy John, the kids, Alan and I are going to Scottish Fest tomorrow.  Sounds like fun, even though I'm of Irish descent.  I would feel more traitorish if it were British Fest.  Then on Sunday, Alan the kids and I are going to Zion.  The boy needs to do his laundry and I figured we'd take them fishing or hiking and have a cute little picnic.  That's a ton of time with Alan and the kids.  It makes me a wee bit nervous that he and Trast are going to butt heads the whole time and I'll have to ref.  I think I ought to have more faith in Alan, though.  He is an adult.   urlLink Cheese is funny.   After all of that excitement I also have a lot to do in the process of moving the kiddos in.  Trast is done with school because he's getting bullied in nasty ways and there is only a week left.  I just figured he could use that week to spend with Mitch.  It does make it a wee bit tougher to move all of their belonging in with them uderfoot.  Let's see is I come out of this next week with Sanity intact.

Any help moving them in next week is appreciated.       I have a roommate.  It was the last fellow I spoke to you all of.  His name is John and he's pretty great.  That is working out well.  Work     Looking again, filing complaints for HQ  Love    Still in it.  I am most content in this area of my life.  It feels really amazing to have this.  Writing    I am doing a feature on June 14th.  Any questions on location and such, get ahold of me.  I should also be doing a Mecca homegrown feature in July, but I am waiting to hear back from Dashia.  I'll have to make it out to Mecca some night soon.  I'm sure there is more, but this will have to do for now.

      Nikol, Is everything ok?  It has been a while since your last post, and you have me worried...  I hope that however you made them pay didn't land you in jail!  Keep me posted on everything and I think it's high time that you took a night and/or weekend off and came up here to see us. My busy life is starting to wind down, school year is over in 10 days, so that is the end to PTA, Girl Scouts and my class, now the busyness will be much more fun!   BTW, Jody's book is now available on BN.com and amazon.com.  The title again is "During" and the authors are Jody Glynn Patrick and Kevin Patrick.  I highly recommend it!  :)

      I have so much to think about right now that it makes me want to scream.  Boys rule my life.  My boys are moving in and I am trying to help them deal with Mitch's upcoming departure as well as establish a new, healthy routine for all of us.  The sad part is that right now sleep is in short supply.  Boys rule my life.  Alan doesn't know if he can handle being a "defacto" father.  Really, any adult would be in the position of being another adult around if they chose to be my friend.  In his case, he is the boyfriend.  He isn't ready for that kind of responsibility.  But he still loves me and wants to try.  I love him so much that it is stifling.  I just have my own concerns for myself and family.  I want someone that will stick around, fo' sho.  Boys rule my life.  Ned turned out to be a very cool man, indeed.  I like him.  I enjoy spending time with him.  I think he feels the same.  However, I'm sooooo hung up on ^^^^ the other boy that my head is full of rocks.  None of my friends are being especially helpful.  They hear me rant and they say, "You should do A."  Then I rant some more and they say, "You should do B."  Then they see the tight spot.  Boys rule my life.  Ugh.  But I do love them, anyway.

      I have to admit I have been a bit depressed.  Not as bad as  urlLink this  guy.  So, I've been spending time with Ned.  We inventoried a shit load of computer parts, then he bought me three adorable new bras from Victoria's Secret because my boobies have gotten smaller as well as my chest width.  I was using safety pins to hold my other bras on.  Then we went out for a very awesome sushi dinner.  It was a perfect evening.  I even got to laugh.  I needed that.  Now I am preparing to go to Andrea's reception.  I hate wedding receptions, but I love Andrea.  Wanna see duality of the world in action?     urlLink forward   then    urlLink back again   Oh, and to Sarah, I know.  You were right.  I mean it.  He was not ready for all of me.  I should have listened to you, but I am a stubborn butt head.  I appreciate that you can tell me what you think.  Right now I am just trying to distance myself from the pain of being  dumped  by that man/boy.  I have to hate him right now or it'll hurt for longer than it needs to.

      I'm sorry, I must say that I read Alan's poem and I thought it was complete crap. I have many more thoughts on it, some of which I already posted, then thought better of and took off, but I will keep the negative to myself.  I will just say one more thing on it, it had the look and feel of a poem written by a whiny high-school girl.  There, that was about the nicest that I could say. Nikol, hang in there, I may be a ways away, and we may not get to see each other due to shitty vehicles, but you are always in my thoughts.

      Alan posted this poem about me on his log.    I love her, and I knew I would from the moment I met her And now that we’re done I want her to know that I’ll never forget her And I know that though I look high and low there’s nobody better She wanted to be together and I wish that I could let her But sometimes life is painful, too hard to trust And sometimes the rains cause two hearts to rust If I’m too damn scared to say ‘forever or bust’ I need her to know for sure that it was never just lust I love the way she laughs, I hate the way she cries I love her pink hair, I love her purple eyes The falafel she fries when she cooks for me Or when she stomps her foot and throws the book at me Saying “Look at me! Take everything I’ve got to give!” But taking that means a life I’m not ready to live I can’t be a father to her beautiful kids And I can’t drive an hour to the place she lives I told her: “Stay,” now I’m the one to go Because the man I am is the only me I know If I stayed, I’d be playing her like G.I. Joe Without enough heart to pay the debts I owe I love her, and I want to keep her safe forever And I’m not the man for that, so it’s now and never I could move the earth with a big enough lever And a place to stand; but what’s after ever? Just more after; I bring tears and laughter And assassin love that lurks in the rafters To strike when you thought you were done with me Take three from four and make you one with me And you’re the one left—not free to run with me The best I can say is have fun with me Drink rum with me, make bad puns with me Soak up the sun with me, come undone with me Get those clothes off, I’m gonna make you come with me I’ll never forget when you’ve done for me. You cried all day, we had a perfect night; We swept up the place and turned out the light; My last view of you was a beautiful sight; And it hurts, it does, but I know it was right.  I want you to know Because it’s so damn hard… I want you to know Because it could not last… I want you to know Before it fades away… I want you to know We’ll always have  this love     I really liked it, even though it basically says I am not good enough to keep him around even when things are rough.  So I guess I should post a poem about him on here.  Let me think.  Hmmmmmm....  Roses are red Violets are blue You suck, coward.  All in good fun, people.  Just remember, hell hath no fury...

      So, Ned helps me out a ton by driving me back to Whitewater on Tuesday since I didn't feel so great.  Then, yesterday the plan was that the kids and I would ride back with him and get my car from Milwaukee.  We got there just before real rush hour and decided to wait it out a bit at Ned's place.  At 6 we got out to my car and said our goodbyes.  Then I realized that I had no friggin keys.  I left them in Whitewater.  GRRRRR.  Luckily, John was willing do drive all the way there to bring my keys to me.

      I had my feature and it went so well!  I was a wreck all day leading up to it, but once I got on stage things went smoothly.  My comfort level on that stage was amazing.  The crowd listened and reacted well.  John even showed up.  Pyramid introduced me, which was so cool.  I love his poetry and it was such an honor that he was there.  Afterwards I got messed up and made an ass of myself.  No fun.

      Alas, the man I loved solidly for six months is no longer my boyfriend.  That situation was somethng awful to behold.  I nearly lost my mind in the break up process.    "So what happens now?     (Another suitcase in another hall) What happens now?      (Take your picture off another wall) Where am I going to?      (You'll get by.  You always have before.) Where am I going to?       (Don't ask anymore.)"  Tonight I am featured at a place called Linnemans.  I am a bit frightened that nobody will be there and I will have no energy.  I want the show to be good.  Right now I am so absolutely nervous that I can't sit still.    Wish me luck.

      From: Shelly <> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I think something strange is going down,  heading down this street   I've waked too long, so far  I've always been the type  who tries to play it safe,  safe under the blankets   of a borrowed bed   that I've found far too lonly  without this girl.  And i want her.  Even with the pair of kids,   and the pair of jacks  she keeps around in her pocket.   I want her.  Even with these sixty miles   and those minuites on my phone I just can't say  stay with me some night,   I'll make you mine.  I'll unpack   that suitcase she's been dragging around  and make her mine.  And underneath the prison term,   and the pinned togeather bra,  the divorce,   the breakup,  and the baggage  there's still this girl   and i want her.  they can't stop me  from wanting to run my fingers   through her chopped off hair  hear her laughter, or her tears  and miss her in this dark  I've got it bad.

      Dead Like Me.  It's for rent at a video store near you.  It's only a buck at Hollywood Video so if you're skeptical go there.  It's a great show.  There were only two seasons and the pilot so it may be cancelled by now.  I dunno.   The 2nd season of the show starts in July.  It was disc 1-3 apparently.  So I just can't read.

      Hidey ho Nikol, I only have a brief amount of time, I am already late for work.  :(  This weekend, believe it or not, is Ashley's piano recital.  The last time I saw you was at her last recital.  Maybe it is meant to be that you come up to visit on Saturday?  Could be... Other than that, I don't think there is anything going on.   Off to work I go, I sure hope we have an unscheduled wine tasting today...

Thalia, I posted to your blog.  Sarah, you rock.  What are you up to next weekend?  I don't think anyone else reads this.

I was pretty upset.  I didn't get back to sleep until around 8'45.  Now its like 5 til 1 and I've been awake for all of ten minutes.  I would have called you now, but I have to wash my body and go pay bills before work.  How unsexy am I?  wash my body.  Calling tonight.  Just to warn ya.

Look around you, look up here Take time to make time, make time to be there Look around, be a part Feel for the winter, but don't have a cold heart  And I love you best You're not like the rest You're there when I need you You're there when I need I'm gonna need you  A long time ago I had a lady to love She made me think of things I never thought of Now she's gone and I'm on my own A love song has come into my mind A love song, it was there all the time  So lady, let me take a look at you now You're there on the dance floor, making me want you somehow Oh lady, I think it's only fair I should say to you Don't be thinkin' that I don't want you, 'cause maybe I do  Look around, come to me I have no answers, but know where I wanna be I look around, play a part I was born in the winter and cooled by a warm heart  And I love you best You're not like the rest You're there when I need you You're there when I need I'm gonna need you  So lady, let me take a look at you now You're there on the dance floor, making me want you somehow Oh lady, I think it's only fair I should say to you Don't be thinkin' that I don't want you, 'cause maybe I do Don't be thinkin' that I don't want you, lady I do

      So I thought it would be cool to create a live journal.  Cool in a nerdy sort of way.  Okay, not cool.  But it is what I wanted to do, dammit.  Unfortunately, I blow!  I cannot for the life of me (no pun intended) figure out how to post images on the damn thing, even though Alan once went to great lengths to describe the process to me.  Ugh.  TECH SUPPPPOOOORT!  Anyway, I will post the link to it as soon as I figure out how the fucker works.

      As I am typing this my fingers are dyed blue.  I was tye-dying (I know,tres' fromage) t-shirts for the boys.     Trast learned to ride his bike last night.  It was amazing.  The training wheels fell off after he attempted a very large hill jump, so he pretty much had to learn to ride his bike, what with  not  riding his bike at all in no way an option he could handle.  He did an absolutely amazing job.  I mean it.  That kid only needed the "this is how you start" and "this is how you stop".  He is riding his bike so well that it makes me drop my jaw.   He even decided that he would master the hills behind our building.  I was not so keen on this idea.  Riding around sidewalks is one thing.  Riding down grassy, bumpy hills is just crazy hard.  He saw me get nervous, too.  He then showed me "Level One".  It was a lower spot on the hill.  He did it.  Then he went to "Level Two".  Let me just point out that it is so friggin cute that he gave the different hill areas level assessments.  He did just fine on level two.  Ayden suggested that he go to Level 9.  Trast pointed out that we didn't have a teleport from level 2 to 9.  Made sense.  Level 3 made me nervous.  Way bumpy and filled with obstacles on the way down.  I told him that he should stop at level 3 for the day, even if he made it down safely.  Up he went and we watched him make it down the hill, take a spin around the yard and come back.  Ayden was so in awe of him that he bowed over and over to him.  Trast's response on it was, "I can't believe I did that.  Wow, level 3 was super hard!"    He kept riding, but he stayed away from any of the higher levels because I told him to stay on 3 until he mastered it.  He even came up with a hand signal to show me he is okay if he falls off.  True, it is just the peace sign, but it is chuckle funny that he came up with that idea.   Okay, one more little thing he said to me that I just have to write down before I forget it.     T- Can I please have some milk because I worked so hard on riding my bike?  M- Would you rather have water?    T- No, I'd rather have milk.  M- Are you sure?  Water is better for you, especially when you are working hard.  T- No.  I want milk.  (matter of  factly)  I am not going to get crabby or grumpy, and I am not going to argue about it.  M- You aren't, huh?  T- No.  But I would 'preciate it if you gave me milk, please.  M- (raising eyebrows) Ohhhh.  I see.  I'll get that for you right now.      Trast is so cool.  They both are.  When they are listening and settled enough to talk to me I am in love with those millions of little thoughts shaping inside their somewhat large heads.  In ten years they will be teenagers and I have no doubt that we will still be having great conversations.  They stimulate my mind and force me to think about things in so many new ways.  I like to imagine the strength of their future opinions.  Mommyville isn't so hard tonight.

      Yeee-Haw.  I survived the tedious move from my old place to Mitch's old place.  Ned and John (Johnny, Peanut, John Burger-Ham, Uncle) did most of the carrying and Andrea came to help me clean.  Now it's just a matter of getting this place in order.  Mitch left it in bad shape and there was an earwig problem, but I am on my way to a cozy home.    I am really digging Ned.  The weekend was rough and silly argument filled.  I think that was good, though.  At least we now know how we are at our worst.  But we made it through the nasty phase.  We had a great morning.  Now he has to go back to Milwaukee.  Booo.  Hiss.    Sarah, I am sorry I didn't make it to Ashley's recital.  Michelle, call me.  Thalia, how was Red Lobster?  Alan, (do you even read this?) I still have that key for you as well as the book thingie for the car.  Does anyone else read this at all?  Let me know at nikol@wastelandpoets.com and I will send you a blogger invite.

      Ok, same day, different time.  What a day it has been!  I took Ashley and two of my girl scouts out to the big castle park and sat for an hour and a half. I got to read my book (Mary called Magdalene - great book by the way) it was a great crisp autumn day.  We also ran errands and had lunch with the hubby at work. Checked out the renovated Lakeview library branch and picked up the last of our pottery pieces from the community center.  Then, I was trying to take some pictures of the girls, and the $400 camera broke!  I am so frustrated with it.  Good thing we bought the extra warranty!  Now we are home and relaxing for a time before we head out to try and get the camera replaced. *sigh*  I am looking forward to being home after that for the remainder of the evening.  I can't believe that Halloween is tomorrow already. We are going to be hanging out with the new neighboors and playing at the parks. Ashley and the girls should enjoy it. I will probably end the day with a pounding headache, but that's typical of a day off surrounded by screaming girls.  Ashley got detention last week for the first time, and lost 20 points. She was misbehaving on the fieldtrip to Cherokee Marsh. I am so disappointed in her. She is such a good kid, she knows better than that. I really thought that she was stronger than that, strong enough to not follow the crowd, to stand up for what is right. I know she's only 7, but still....I took away her tv, radio and computer privledges for 4 days, and she has to write a formal apology letter to the teacher, principal and the Naturalist who was leading the field trip. I thought that it was a just punishment. This is her first real "occurence" at school, and I want to make an impression on her and let her know from the start that this will not be tolerated.  Then I was chatting with a friend, and she thought I was being too harsh.  I mean really, how can it be to harsh to formally apologize to someone that you have disrespected?  And honestly, it's good for her to lose the electronics, she has been reading and writing and playing piano more. That just irked me. I feel like I am really doing the best that I can, I hate being judged. Offering advise is one thing, but judging is another. I hope that I don't judge others like that. I will have to be more careful of that from now on.  But maybe that is why it happened, so that I could look into myself and fix a problem. I know that I am .quick to judge, and judge harshly. I honestly don't think that I let those judgements out, except to Christopher, but even then, it's still not a healthy thing to do. Ashley and I broke the new house rule. We splurged at the store today. We got a VHS copy of "The Nightmare Before Christmas" I hope Christopher doesn't get too upset. This not spending money thing is going to be really hard for me, I'll have to try though.

      Well, here we go. I am going to try this thing. See if it will be therapeutic.  There are always so many things going on in my mind that just don't make sense and writing on paper just takes too long. I will probably not keep up on it anyways, but it is worth a try. So I have the next four days off. I will be busy with Halloween events an have to go to Milwaukee on Sunday to visit Stephanie and baby. By the time these 4 days are done, I will be missing the peace and quiet of work.  But then Christopher will be gone. Gone to Wausau for work. Its so hard to sleep with out him. It will be a total of ten days that we are alone. That is scary. I am so dependant, actually, I guess we are co-dependant. He doesn't function well without me either. I still can't figure out if that is a good thing or a bad thing. Well, I've had 10 minutes of quiet, but now it's time to start the day. Ashley is calling.

      Well, it's been a while. I have been busy doing "stuff".  I have actually decided to satrt working out again. I went to the Princeton club today and it felt great!  I have set up to go with Laura to areobics next week.  I have never thought of myself as an aerobics gal, but if I'm there with someone I know, it might be okay.  It seems a little wierd, Laura is a bit older than I am, and her daughters babysit for Ashley, but really, almost all my friends are that age. I guess it just feels different with her because her girls are so much older.  Who knows?  I also organized an outing for the troop to go to the club and meet with a personal trainer and tour the facility. I think that it will be fun.  Our collection for the family that lost their home in the fire is going well. I am so proud of those girls, they are all such good kids, even the new ones that I was worried about are doing a great job. I went out with Mary last weekend, I am afraid that it will be the last time that I see her ever.  We said that we would try to hook up at least one more time, but I think that with the holidays coming, it will be hard. Christopher was with us, and we ran into Franki!  Nikol and I met him the last time that we went out with Mary and we had such a great time making fun of him and calling him "Nick".  This time was just as good.  note to self, never get Franki talking about real estate. I got an e-mail from Angela on Monday. I have not heard from her in forever. She is really nice, I feel bad that we didn't "click" after the first couple of days.  I think that the whole thing, the whole summer and into fall, was a great time of growth for me. I have learned so much and met some great people. I am sure that I have made the right choices, I would have regretted not taking action, but I've also learned that some things are better when left as a fantasy. sigh I do miss Nikol, I have not been able to catch her at all lately. I did get an e-mail reply, but I can never find her on line. I wonder if it has to do with her switching her ID.  I'll have to e-mail again soon. Christopher is bugging me about this blog thing. He wants to read it. I guess he can, It's not a big deal, nothing is secret. I would just hate to have that in the back of my mind all the time, like I'm writing for an audience. I know it's just my husband, but still. Maybe somethings should still be private. He wouldn't want me to read his journals. I know, because I tried that a few years ago! So we saw the third installment of the Matrix. I loved it!  I can not say enough positive things about it!  I think that it was as good as the original, but in its own ways. It can't really be measured against the original, but as a closing of the story, it was everything that I had hoped for. Class is going well, however, there were some disturbing passages. Lots about enochs and even some about being eaten by dogs!  Just a lot of death and above all else, alot of contradiction.  I feel like I was just finding a faith (very ignorant of me) and now that I am really studying it, I am very much questioning what I thought that I had come to believe.  I find it interesting, but I have a really hard time being a real believer. I honestly think of the Bible as a collection of stories. Some of them are great; timeless stories of betrayal, love and human nature.  There are some wonderful lessons learned, and alot of those lessons carry over into today, but honestly, I find most of it just arbitrary and completely unrealistic.  I believe in the behaviors that are characteristicaly Christian, but I don't know what else at this point. Sometimes I feel like a hypocrit, and feel guilt for having been confirmed and becoming a member without having a real knowledge of the faith. It's a constant struggle. Add that to the Non-Christian faith that I was brought up in, and there is just a mess of stuff going on in my little head.  I could go on about this religious topic all day, but I won't. Joe Schmo is on and my new book is calling my name.  Is that sacreligous, to leave a bible monolouge to watch trashy reality TV and read a book about the post-apocolyptic world?

      wow, it's been over a month since I posted here...So much has happened. I don't even know where to begin. Well, we had a huge scare about my dad. He was admitted to St. Mary's infectious disese unit for a rare but serious infection of the vertebrae. They compared it to meningitis, only more rare and more serious.  So mom calls me in tears to tell me this and to say that they need to get him up to the hospital asap, but it is dark and rainy and they don't know if they can find the hospital. I tell them to just come here and I will take them. Christopher is in night class, so there is no way in hell he can get a sub to come home for Ashley, and there is no way I am going to take her to the hospital with us. I send her over to one of the neighboors that we don't know too terribly well, but well enough to know that she is safe. We get to the hosital and they are expecting us and rush us into the infectious disese unit and page several specialists to come and poke needles into dad. They took so much blood it was a miracle that he was even coherent!  Robbie came down from Green Bay, which is a whole other story, I haven't spoken to him in three years, I now I remember why....anyways, so Dad is in the hospital and the nurses have not been briefed as to what is going on, they were just told that his condition was serious. Meanwhile, we are freaking out, not knowing what is going on, but knowing that it is not good. Long, painful, teary story short, he does not have this terrible disease afterall. Some Bozo at the Fort hospital mis read the MRI and caused this whole thing.  We were all so relieved, but also a little upset that our family was put through so much worry for what turned out to be nothing at all. Well, not technically nothing, we still don't believe the nit-wit Doctors diagnosis of osteo arthritis, if it was arthritis, and nothing more, why the hell would his legs be numb?!?!?  Anyways, we are all good now, but it was a hard few days. I actually had to cancel my last date with Mary because of this whole thing. That bummed me out, we were going to try to hang out one last time before she takes off to jet-set around the globe. Good Luck Mary!  We will miss you! So, my brother...what can I say except that he is the type of person that I would like to think doesn't really exsist. But he does, and there are many more like him.  He brought dad the book "Treason" by Ann Coulter to read while he was in the hospital. Now, if I (or any rational human being) were to read this, it would be amusing because of how ignorant and blind this woman is , but for my brother, this is like his bible.  Although if he knew I was using bible and him in the same sentance, he would frak out about how there is no God, not just no Christian God, but no higher power of any kind what so ever. So, we argued about everything. We went to McDonalds and got $6 worth of food, he proceeded to pay with a $100 bill. When I said that they may not take such a large denomination, he went off about how they HAVE to, any moron can read the words legal tender on the bill and realize that they can't refuse it. He actually got so mad while telling me this that his freaky little head turned red.  When he was bragging about how rich he is now (no doubt rubbing it in b/c I was talking to mom about how poor we are) he proudly stated that he loves being the boss and that now matter what the fucking law says, he will never hire a minority. He talked about his loaded 9mm that he keeps in the house and about how much he hates the principal at the kids school, for no other reason than "she is a fucking dyke"  nice, I know...he again said that Ashley is a brat. and when we were watching the news about the college student who is missing, he said that her parents should face reality and quit looking, the girl is obviously dead.  I can't believe how cold he is. And he is a parent, you would think that he would have some compassion.  He is so pro war that it is crazy, he thinks that Bush is the best president ever and that Arnold Schwarteneger is a great governor b/c of his repeal of the immigrant drivers liscense law thath Davis had passed. I also found out that he hits his wife (at least he didn't proudly proclaim this fact, I found out from my mom, who just doesn't know what to do about it) I can not believ that I am related to a stupid person like this. I got home that night and watched "Bowling for Columbine" twice in a row and debated sending to him, but he would probably just talk about how much he likes Charlton Heston and have a shitty comeback to all of the questions that are asked during the film. That is a great film by the way, if you haven't seen it, you must. It has made me much more aware of the fear in our society and how absolutley everything revolves around that fear. The worst part is that I can see some of those fears in myself.... Anyways, we got our place decorated for Christmas finally and I have all the gifts purchased and wrapped and got all of the Christmas cards made and sent. That is such a relief. Janet and I were working on a 50 year time line to put up in the school and that took so much time, but we finished that this month and that is such a load off!  and I am so happy that there is only 6 months left of PTA and Girl scouts before the summer break!  very happy that next year for PTA I will just be a pta mom, not an actual board member. Then I will be free to concentrate on Girl Scouts and Sunday School, and also on myself, I feel so lost sometimes. I am not looking forward to disciple ending in 5 months, I am loving that class and am learning so much and making so graet fiends, I already can't wait for disciple II!  Oh, also in the last month, I have started selling Avon, I know, I know, Sarah, and avon lady?!?! It just doesn't seem to go together, but I am really enjoying it, I like getting the discounts and seeing the specials, it is also a great excuse to keep in touch with my friends a little more, I can call to talk about an avon special, and the talk will turn to other things and it is just so nice.  I still have not really talked to Nikol, that really sucks, I just don't know whats going on there... Oh, I also have been playing match maker, I set up Mike (a single brownie dad) with Melissa, a girl from work, they have not actually met yet, but have talked on the phone for hours on end and really like each other so far. I am so proud of myself! Tomorrow at church, we are greeting at the early service, they are the advent family for the later service and Ashley is in the Christmas program at the late service. So we will be there from like 8 in the moring until just after noon! I wish we wouldn't have signed up to do anything at the early service.  oh, I am also going to be teaching a class!  I am going to be a "religious leader" for 7 little girls, I will be guiding them and teaching them and at the end of our time, they will be presented with their religious awards. Again , that just doen't seem like Sarah, but I think it will be fun.  Which brings me to another thing. I have been struggling for so long about who I really am. I know what I do and some things that I like and dislike, but I don't feel like I know who I am. Like, I don't ahve a style of dress, I don't really have anything that I always do, wear or say or even a way that I act on any regular basis. christopher says that this is what makes me "me", but I want to have a thing....I want to have a style of dress that defines me, not preppy sweaters one day, workout pants the next and hot topic clothes on yet another day. I am a PTA and Church board member who has a nose ring and a some "questionable" bumper stickers, It just seems like no two parts of me really fit together.  Myabe i have an identity disorder, yeahy, thats got to be it. I should go, I am reading a good book and i want to get a few more chapters in before I fall asleep.

      I'm here. Not too much to say though. we are going away for the weekend.  It will be the first time we have missed Rhythm  and booms since I have lived in Madison.  I just have to keep telling myself it will be okay. We will still have fun in a secluded little cabin in the woods.  Ashley is home and she had a grand time at camp.  She had a new sitter today and was even in a car with her and at the pool.  I am really starting to let her do more.  It is scary, but I think it will be okay.

      I have only a short amount of time.  I am getting ready to take Ashley to camp.  This is her third year going to sleep away camp, so it should be easy.  It is only three days, so it should be really easy.  But it still is not.  She is so full of excitement and energy, I don;t know how we will survive the hour and a half car ride up there! So, I am taking a new medicine.  Just what I wanted to avoid, but that is all the Psychiatrist would do for now.  She wants to have me start seeing a therapist, but said that drugs are the best way to start.  I go to the therapist in two weeks.  I hate  to admit is, but by the 2nd day, I felt a difference.  I feel calmer, not drugged, but just calmer.  I hate being this way, but maybe I'll just have to get used to it. We got a new computer.  An iMac.  I have no idea how to run an iMac.  We bought it off a friend for $70.  Christopher wanted a computer for his office/laundry room, and his only requirement was that it had a word processor.  I don't think he likes it, but hopefully he will get used to it.   My Stampin' Up party was fun, it had big sales.  Three people agreed to book shows off of this one and I got two people who have actually decided to sign on as demonstrators and one of those peoples friends is signing on as well!  It makes me wish I had signed on right away as a demonstrator, by now, I would have a downline!  I have decided against it though.  I have just started to put a bit of an effort into the Avon, and that is going well. I don;t want to start taking on more than I can handle - again! Ashley did well at the recital, she made two little mistakes, but she kept on playing.  She played first and we just left right after she played, she had a birthday party to go to and I really wanted her to be able to do both things.  That's all for now.  I think that maybe I should try to do shorter posts more often, rather than such long posts.  But I guess for me, it really is more like journaling than putting out anything of substance for anyone to read. So it doesn't really matter. Off to camp.

      i got lost in the woods yesterday and ended up on a 4 mile hike.  It was actually kind of exciting. I found a new beach and boat launch on the trek, so I guess it is worth it. we got an I-Mac from a friend, should be getting it by the end of the week. I told her, " I will gladly pay you Friday for a computer today" in a sing song voice, but I think that she must have never watched popeye.  the wimpy hamburger reference went right over her head.  Good news!  We got an X-box!  Yeah!  I think I may have already posted that though.  but it is good news so it is okay to say again.  There, hows that for a fucking happy entry?  Here is a  urlLink book  that must be read.

      I hate everything. That has become my daily (sometimes more than daily) saying.  Tonight, Ashley called me from my parents in tears b/c of the severe weather.  This from a kid who normally is outside watching the storms and asking science questions throughout.  I should be able to count on my parents to have her in bed at a reasonable hour, keep her from worrying about the storm rather than starting and then feeding that worry, and to feed her real meals.  Instead, she was still up at 10:30, even though she has tennis here in Madison at 9am tomorrow and a full day planned beyond that.  She is hysterical about the storm, and when I calm her and promise it will be okay, she calls back to inform me that I could not possibly make a promise when it comes to the weather and why did I lie to her.  Nice, huh?  She has been in Whitewater for 5 meals this week, and three of them were fast food, the other two (breakfast) were sugary donuts.  My niece is as bad as my brother.  We were in the truck and this 8 yr old is making comments about the "fat" people who are outside walking.  Anything she doesn't understand is stupid and she is just plain mean.  How can I feel such animosity towards a kid?  I know that it is not her fault, but the fault of the parents, but still. Ashley is so tired of it too.  And I am tired of explaining to her why some people think it is okay to act in such hurtful ways to others.  I have the Psych appointment tomorrow and am scared.  I feel like such a failure and I do not want to humiliate myself, which is what I tend to do a lot.  I hate everything about my life at this point.  Well that's not fair to say, I love Christopher and Ashley, but I hate the relationship ruts that we are all in.  I just want to be happy.  How does it come so naturally to some people? my cousin Lori has HIV and hepatitis C.  She is also in prison on drug charges again.  I am not close to her at all, she is one of the oldest in the family, and I am one of the youngest, but still, it is very bothersome to me.  I did have another stapmin' up party and it was nice.  I feel blessed to have friends who will take time out of their nights to come to my little crafty nights.  Although, the one girls who I invite for Christopher's sake is really very negative.  She has come to two parties and so far has made criticisms to Christopher about both parties.  Maybe she thinks that she is being helpful, but she's not. In fact, it makes me dislike her.  She is still young, and maybe has yet to learn that sometimes you have to keep your negative shit to yourself. Hell, we all forget that sometimes, but I have thought both of those parties were successes, until I got her feedback.  And I think the worst part is that she would never tell me, but she tells Christopher and prefaces it with , "Don't tell Sarah I said this but..."  That is the most annoying of all.  I know that Christopher is trying to be helpful when he passes this along to me, and I am honestly glad that he does, I don't want him to keep silly little things from me or feel like he cannot talk to me, but it is still annoying.  She complained about the wine temperature for Christs' sake!  I wanted to scream, "you are getting free wine, either drink it and like it or shut the fuck up!"  anyways, enough bitching for the night.  I have had a bad night and I needed to vent.  That's all this fucking page is, a big fucking  bitch fest.  That's okay, better out here than stuck inside.  Maybe I will be drugged again soon and then I can be falsely happy and oblivious to the world around me again.  That's what Doctors do for you, isn't it? On a happy note, Christopher's little sister is the quote of the day at seventeen.com today.  Her quote is this: "Love is something you find and can never lose, just misplace." --Hilary, 14, Amboy, MN     isn't that sweet?  Poor, misguided youth...

      Here is a rundown of my week. Partially so I can vent about the busyness and partially just to keep it straight.  Yesterday, Father's Day, slept in, went downtown to eat bagels and went to the Union to hang out in the sun.  Came home, mom and dad picked up Ashley to stay the night at their place with Hannah, my niece. Went out to the store and bought an X-Box, spent $300 which we did not have.  Check will bounce.  Why so I do these things?!?!?!?  Today, woke up, went to work late, then worked all day and wentto Edgerton to meet my dad to pick up Ashley.  Cleaned house in preparation for tomorrow's party. Tomorrow, Ashley has tennis and then we will have to scrape together a little bit of dough to get some snacks to have for the Stampin'Up party.  I am expecting about 11 people, but am pretty sure that the two Milwaukee gals won't show.  Also think that Dana will skip on me since I skipped her party on Saturday.  Toni will probably stay late and I will not get to bed until after mid-night again.  Ashley will go back to Whitewater with mom and dada and Hannah since my Wednesday babysitter is in Florida.  I work all day Wednesday.  Wednesday night, freedom!  Christopher and i home alone!  Yeah!  Thursday, mom and dada and Hannah are up again, this time to take Ashley to tennis for me while I am at the dreaded psych. appt with christopher.  After that, off to the zoo with Toni, the tripkets and Mitchell, Ashley, mom, dad and Hannah.  Then mom and dad can go home for a long time.  I've had enough this week!  Friday, Christopher is home with Ashley, I work all day.  He is supposed to clean the garage.  we will see.  Saturday, Ashley's recital and then Sunday, NOTHING!!!!!  i can't wait for Sunday! I have more cleaning to do, but I guess it can wait until tomorrow.  I know that the party gals will not be looking at the cleanliness of things, but I guess I feel self consious about it because our place is so old and worn out anyways, and everyone else owns their own homes, so I feel like a little person.  I shouldn't, I know.  These people are my friends, and they do not make me feel that way. I do it to myself.  I need to stop hating myself. So, the whole spacecraft thing is so cool!  I am very impressed.  I am reading the  urlLink best book !  It is Finnish, I have never read a finnish book before.  I love it.  Very enchanting and gripping.  I did just read Joyce Carol Oates' newest one called,  urlLink Rape: A love story .  It was so raw.  That woman does not write fluff.  Thats why I love her books, but this one touched a little too close.  Even so, I highly recommend it.   Off I go to play the D&D X-box game.  later.

I know that I have been a crappy friend.  I am sorry.  You are in my thoughts and I want you to know that you (and the boys) are always welcome to come here for a break from the world.  I am always here if you need to talk.

      Men suck.  They really really do.  Yes, even the husband I usually rave about sucks.  I get frustrated and sometimes I just need a little extra love and attention.  Sometimes, damn it, I even need to raise my voice.  Is that so fucking terrible?  I get upset and I need to cry, I need to swear, I need to scream and throw things.  I have a lot inside.  At times, I just can't keep it in for another moment.  I (almost) always keep it together in front of Ashley.  I am a pleasant, laid back person at work.  I am a responsible church member, Sunday school teacher, Girl Scout leader, and school volunteer.  I smile a lot and I am always so nice to the people around me.  When I get home, the place where I am comfortable enough to not put on a show, I would like to be able to get it out and start fresh.  I learned today, that when you are married to Christopher Urban, that is a fucking unforgivable crime. I warned him that I was crabby, and that I had a crappy day, I even told him a bit about the crappy day.  I vented, and I admit, I took it out on him a little.  I even apologized for that.  But then he started to ignore me and talk to me in this shitty condescending voice that he does so well.  I can't even go into everything that was said, I don't want to relive it.  I will just say that it was way to similar to the fights that were a fixture in my first marriage.  Right down to the grabbing me so hard that it hurts and will probably bruise.  Not that I didn't deserve it, and it's not like he hit me or anything, but damn it, no body should touch me when I am that worked up!  Except in the first marriage, at least there was yelling back.  That is so much easier to deal with than his cold, harsh words.  He takes the things that he knows I am sensitive about and tells me that my worst fears are true.  I am a bad wife, I don't take care of Ashley, Our house is a dump, etc... Since I have been off of my meds, I have been trying very hard to work through some things that have been hidden for a long time. I have told him things that I have never told anyone, I have said things to him that I have never before spoken aloud, and I have trusted him with my soul, my tattered and broken soul.  What I have gotten in return for that is pity (the last thing I want) and criticism for crying too much.  This is all coming from a man who had a great family and a great childhood and hardly ever made a mistake or did anything wrong.  He did make mistakes after he was older and out of the house, but even then, he has always had someone to turn to, someone who would love him through it all.  I should have known he would never understand me.  He still doesn't know half of what bothers me on a daily basis, he doesn't know half of what goes through my head, the memories, the regrets.  I thought that I had someone who would love me and support me through everything.  Until recently, I honestly never ever even thought that I could talk about a lot of my past, It assn;t even a conscious decision, it was just like I all of a sudden started talking to him bout things, and it felt so freeing.  Now I see that my initial fears were dead on, no one will ever really know me, and know what goes on in my head and still love me.  What a fool I was to think that I was going to be free of the demons and happy.   At this point, it was left with the acknowledgement that just wanting something to work out is not enough, and trying to make it work is not really enough either. the jerk couldn't even wait another week and a half until I can get on a new medicine, at least then, I would have been able to cope with an argument. I am such a whiner.  I hate whiners.  I hate fucking cry-babies too.

      Rasputan was the man.  I am glad you had a good day.  I wouldn't feel so bad about the debacle with Ashley the other day.  Parents are human beings that get used a lot.  After a point you start to question why you ever even take care of them.

      today was the Memorial Unions 75th Anniversary bash. We hung out down there for about 7 hours.  Ashley and I went on a free Wisconsin Ducks ride and CHristopher got to stend the hour and a half that we were in line sitting in the shade reading.  It was worth it though, Ashley really enjoyed the ride.  It's not often that you get to see the "Ducks" in Madison.  I took some great pictures from the water too.  I finally got all 20 games picked out for VBS next week, but now I have to pair them up (two a day) in a way that makes sense and will flow.  I am already tired of VBS and it hasn't even started for the year yet! It will be fun, and at least I have 4 nights that I do not have to cook supper, thats a bonus.  Just now, as I am typing this, I realized that I do not need 20 games after all, but 16.  oh well, at least I can have back ups in case one of the others doesn't work well.  I had a good day mentally at least.  I got a little touchy a few times, but not too bad.  I only got really mad once, and that was when Ashley started to walk across the street without looking and a car had to quickly slow down to avoid hitting her.  I think that was justified.   It is almost 11pm and I think that I should try to get some sleep.  We have to get up early for church tomorrow and I don't want to wake up crabby. Oh, we saw our old neighboor Kim down at the Union today.  Christopher always thought that she had a crush on me, but I'm not so sure, he always gets all funny when she is around, he gets this little grin on his face like he is thinking about something that he shouldn't be!  I have really just lost most of that desire, for now at least, and especially not with Kim!  It has been difficult enough for me to get up enough desire for my husband, let alone anyone else.  It is at the point when we basically have to start having sex before I even start to get excited.  Oh well, I hope it is just a phase.  Now that I've got penis on the mind,  urlLink Rasputin's penis  is huge! Gotta get to bed!

      I can't. I am in charge of Vacation Bible school at our church, and that is every night next week.  Don't ask me why I am doing this, I shouldn't be.  I am grossly lacking in spirituality of late.   I still have 20 games that I need to plan for and get supplies for by Monday. I am a horrible parent. I just said awful things to Ashley.  I told her that she was a horrid wicked child and that I couldn't stand to look at her for another second. What do I do these things?  The worst part is, I meant it, I still mean it, I cannot stand to be near her. I want to just stop being her mom and run away from it all.  My bankruptcy attorney needs copies of my fed tax returns and I don't have  a printer that works and it is on a program on the computer and I can't even pull the page up to e-mail it to anyone to print for me.  I would have to install the program on someone's computer and then go through step by step to even get to the print page. I hate everything.  I just wasted an hour in Ashley's room throwing away 7 huge garbage bags full of toys/shit.  Hundreds of dollars worth of shit, probably more, I say a few items that were near $100 each in my rage.  I am not wealthy enough to just throw stuff away, I should be trying to sell it, but I just don't care. I have no energy and no desire to do anything. I took ash and a friend out to do fun stuff this morning and took them to this loud, colorful obnoxious deli and I hated it, but I thought that they would enjoy it.  I never even got a thank you at all. I know they are just kids, but I have tried so hard for so many years to make Ashley a kind respectful little girl.  She can be to others, but never to me.  Sometimes I just need her to hug me and tell me thank you or even hug me and tell me that she loves me without it being a preface to her either wanting something or admitting to doing something wrong. I got her a gift to give her for the end of the year and as a reward for her great grades and now I don't even want to give it to her. I am such a horrible mother, I don't know why I bother, I really, really don't. I am going to go cry more and forget that I am a mother for the rest of my life...

      Yea! I'm home from work for four glorious days!  Granted, I have tons of work to do in those days and school stuff to do with Ashley, but still, I am happy to be home.  That is a good sign, I went through a spell when I would rather be anywhere but home.  I got pissed at my husband today.  He is normally so sweet and such a good man.  I cannot stress enough how good he is for me and that without him, I would be so lost, but I still get pissed at him occasionally!  Here's the thing, I was hinting around about Fathers day gifts and then flat out asked him what he wanted, and he basically said to not be a father for a day. He wants a day to himself, no noise, no interruptions from whatever he decides to do.  That made me mad, and it hurt a little. Fathers day is to celebrate being a father and (I think) should entail being with your family.  We should do something that is enjoyable for him, but as a family.  That's just my opinion, maybe I got a little too upset, but I still think I"m right. Tomorrow is the big school picnic. It should be fun, if it doesn't rain that is.  I don't remember if I wrote about my hospital experience with my brother or not, I don't think so.  I know that I cried a lot to Christopher about it.  He is such a red-necked prejudice fool. It is terrible for he to despise my own flesh and blood, but I do.  When he came, he noticed on the board that my dad's nurse from the evening before was a guy.  He decided that he would tell the current female nurse that he would not allow his father to be attended to by a male nurse again,.  The female nurse looked puzzled, but said she would see what she could do.  Rob then said that he was opposed to a male nurse because all guy nurses are "faggots".  Then he went on a spiel about how he hates "fucking faggots" and he just can't help it, "freaks" like that make him uncomfortable.  Here I am, sitting in a chair in the same room, just wishing I could disappear.  He went on and on about gays, people of color and fat people. On and on and on.  I would say that I hate him, but looking at him makes me see just how ugly hate is.  I can't hate him, I can pity him and dislike him and feel sorry for his kids and pray that they grow up to see the world differently than he does.  We were raised in the same home and I am full of love and acceptance, I embrace differences and applaud people who are able to love openly, while he thinks that his opinion is the only right way.  He is also a Bushleaguer, to quote my man Eddie. I flat out asked him if he knows anyone who has lost their life in this war, of course he said no, but that they all signed up for the military knowing that they could die in war, so that would therefore make it okay.   I told him that one of our close friends lost her nephew and that it has torn the family apart. He seems to think that the family should have expected it from the day Brian signed up with the air force.  He also feels that the prisoner abuse was warranted, not only warranted, but that it should have continued to teach a lesson to the other "camel-jockeys".  Sometimes it is hard to not combat hate with hate, but I will try to love my enemy...

      here i am again. Now it is Tuesday morning and it is so hot in here that I woke up sweating.  In our lease it states that we have an air conditioner for each level, ut the one for the upstairs, where the baedrooms are, has not been put in by the landlord.  When I called yesterday to complain, I was advised to turn on the fans.  I hate our freaking landlords.  Meanwhile, I'm sure they have had their A/c on for the last week.  We have one in the downstairs and thats good I guess, but should we really be expected to  sleep in the living room? Ashley has a field trip today in thi snasty heat as well. They are walking to the Botanical gardens and then to the park at lake Monona, and then to Michaels for custard.  I am glad that I will not be in the heat with them.   I have PTA tonight, and i have not balanced the PTA checkbook since december.  Remarkably, it is only off $47, for me, thats amazing, but the rest of the board will probably not see it that way. I am not a good person. not at all. I gotta go get Ashley up and ready for the day and gtet myself in to work. I am just so tired. I have done nothing but complain all morning.  I need to put on my happy face! To Nikol - I would offer to come to WW, but with the state I have been in, I think that going to that town would crack me.  Even if you can get up here with the kids, I can have our sitter watch them all, she loves it when Ashley has friends along.  Let me know.

      It is high time the two of us got together.  I'm serious this time.  Life sucks a lot out of people and it is so easy to be busy all of the time, but you end up missing out on importnat things, like being there for your friends.  So I need to figure out a way to get some gas money and a babysitter and get to Madison.  We need to do this because I have not forgotten every conversation you and I had in which we were typing the same things at the same time.  That mean that I probably know what it is like in your head when things are not so great.  It sounds as though now is one of those times.  Call me soon, okay?

      Six months has passed since the last entry. I wish I could say that my life has been so peachy that I had nothing to get out.  In fact, it is just the opposite. I have had a terrible time lately. I don't even know where to begin... I am off all my meds for one.  I got the bright idea that I am no longer suffering from depression.  Didn't stop to think that maybe it was just that the meds were working their magic. The withdrawal was awful.  I can't even begin to describe it.  I had so many symptoms, I can't even remember them all. I had the dizziness, the lightheadedness (up till now, I thought that dizziness and light-headedness was the same thing, now I know differently) I was throwing up in the shower almost every morning, and when I would turn my head, my eyes would go out of focus. I have gained 10 more pounds since stopping the medicine, now I am really overweight.  I was losing concentration, I would be at work and entering some data into the computer and totally forget what I was doing.  I have screwed up so many things at work, from transferring the wrong amount of money between accounts to forgetting how to alphabetize the file drawers.  I finally told my boss that I was suffering from withdrawal from being off of a migraine medicine so I wouldn't get fired for my errors. I was getting the shakes so bad that my back would ache from shuddering for so long.  I couldn't even tell Christopher the severity of the symptoms, I just couldn't get it across without sounding like I am trying to do the "poor me" bit. Antidepressants are supposed to be non-habit forming, but after 7 years on a drug that was only recommended for one year, I guess my body couldn't help but feel addicted.  It was only a short time off the meds before I started having dreams and panic attacks again.  I have not told Christopher this yet either.  I made an appointment to go to a Psychiatrist, my first ever. Last year, when my Gyno found out that I had never been counseled about my depression, but only prescribed drugs after I went to the clinic with my self-diagnosis, she said that she would not renew the prescription again until I spoke with someone.   Speak with someone, talk to someone, see someone...It's all such crap, why not say what they are really thinking, "You are one fucked up lunatic".  Now, I will go and do the whole poor me bit for a stranger who will no doubt give me more medicine, either a different kind or the same thing all over again.  Here's the thing, I don't want to talk about all of my problems.  I know that I have made some bad choices and that I had a not-so-typical childhood.  In fact, sometimes, when I just think about it, I just start to cry.  I didn't know it at the time, but my life was really different.  I mean, I knew that following the whole Jehovah's witness rules made me different, but I really thought that other moms would pick one food for months and eat nothing but that. I really thought that all of the friends I had were going to burn in hell because they did not follow the "right" God.  I thought that when you grew up, you left your families and only came back if you were told to do so.  I thought that it was okay, normal even to tease people, including family members, for things that they had no control over.  I was raised to scoff at my fat Aunt, and make pig noises when referring to her.  My cousin, who my aunt claimed "had a chemical imbalance" was really just crazy and too woosy to deal with life.  When he killed himself, it was my aunt and uncles fault b/c they never taught him to be tough.  Fast forward 10-15 years to me, leaving home at 15 to live with a loser druggie (nick-named crack, appropriately) and get knocked up, have a miscarriage, get knocked up again have Ashley (the only good thing to happen to me up to that point in my life) and then get knocked up yet again and have an abortion all alone.  Now, my mom believe that there is such a thing as a "chemical imbalance" because she was diagnosed with one, but she is so proud of it that within five minutes of meeting someone, they know about it, and have probably seen her breast implants too.  If you give her another two minutes, you will hear about her Fat "shrink" who died, probably because she was so fat that she could hardly move.  Mom recently has gone to using the word "obese" so I corrected her to tell her that obese is actually a medical term and does not necessarily mean fat, but has to do with body fat vs. muscle.  So then she goes on to tell me (and Ashley) about all the people that she knows that are obese.  They must be, because they are flabby. * sigh* Ashley will go to visit and is allowed to watch trashy reality TV and has been told about cosmetic surgery and how it makes you pretty.  She has also been briefed on how to diet and what she should not eat if she wants to stay slim.   Anyways...Now I am rambling. I was just going to get out a bit about my years as a kid, and it ran on and on and on.   so, the point is, I am going to see a "shrink".  I can't even tell my mom and dad, b/c then that will be cool, and something I should be proud of, and everyone that knows me who happens to run into my mom at the grocery store will know that I need a shrink. Making the initial appointment was so hard, I don't know why.  I wasn't even going to do it, but I started losing my temper with Ashley over stupid shit.  I swear, If Christopher hadn't been there, I would have done some real damage.  As it is, I feel terrible for the way I treated her and the things that I said.  I guess as long as I can feel bad and know that I did wrong, I'm not too far gone yet. The other turning point was that I cut myself again.  I had not used glass on my arm since I was probably 16.  I would occasionally still keep a stash of sharp things, just for comfort, but I never really considered using any of it.  Then the q-tip jar broke and the glass was sitting there on the sink and I didn't even know what I had done until after it was over.  My arm was bleeding and when I looked down, I started to hyper-ventilate. I showed Christopher, but I think that he thinks I was trying to get attention.  He tries so hard, but never really understands.  I love him so much, and love that he tries, but no one can ever really grasp what is in another persons head. Anyways, if not for him, I would be in a much worse place.  I know exactly where. I would still be in Whitewater, with three kids, married to a loser who would hit me and get drunk a lot.  Ashley would be in school, but I would not be active, she would not be in all the activities that she is now, and she would not ever see her mom happy.  I would be ignorant and probably hate gay people and kick kittens.  I would shop at wal-mart and love the deals that they give, thank goodness someone cares enough to save us money, right?  I would look at all people who were not rednecks like me as freaks and I would probably drive and a SUV. Here, at home in Madison, at least I have been able to get away from all the people of my past and grow as an individual and as part of a couple.  Yes, I may be unhappy at times, and yes, Ashley does see that occasionally, but for the most part, she sees a happy mom, who is still madly in love after 5 1/2 years. okay, now I have to go.  Maybe I will try to keep up on this thing again, if nothing else, it is a good way to vent without having the people around me think that I am trying to get sympathy. signing off.

      She has only spent two nights at home this week!&nbsp; She is growing up and having tons of sleepovers and I miss her!&nbsp; I was going to help her dye her hair red tonight, so maybe its better that she was not home. That may have maybe not gone over so well. I am so tired of having a cluttered house. Ever since the garage sale, I have been going through things little by little to try to get rid of shit.&nbsp; The kitchen is almost done, all organized and there is only 1 cupboard and 1 drawer left to do, of course, they are the messiest ones!&nbsp; :) The living room is about as good as it gets, one can only do so much with a small roomthat has to have the computer, piano, entertainment center, couch and chair! Our room is getting pretty bad, Ashley's is a lost cause, I keep trying to help her do little bits, but then she just trashes it again when she plays.&nbsp; Our closet is so full of shit!&nbsp; I need to go through all of the stuff in there and box it up. There are a lot of things that Ashley has made for me, or pictures and other things worth saving that I should just get out of the closet and into storage. That is the other issue!&nbsp; Our back room is so cluttered still!&nbsp; And the garage too. we keep saying that we will clean it, but ot really is the last thing that we want to do.&nbsp; I even defrosted the freezer to get out of cleaning down there!&nbsp; We will just have to get some big storage tubs and just do it. Wow, what a boring blog.&nbsp; cleaning and organizing, just what everyuone wants to read about! I am going to go read something that is much more interesting.

      Any plans for the weekend?&nbsp; Give me a call as I always lose your number 'cause I suck at organizing things.&nbsp; For real, we want to come to Madison and see you.&nbsp; Don't laugh at my fat rolls, though.&nbsp; I'm back up to 130.&nbsp; BUT I started working out, so soon I'll be normal. Shit!&nbsp; I just realized how awful that was.&nbsp; You have so many posts about your family talking about people being overweight.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; I don't focus on other people's size.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just obsess over my own.&nbsp; Is that any better?

      Happy Birthday to me.  I am 27 years old today. In my dreams and visions as a child and young person, I was going to be happily married, living in a nice house in Maine and be pregnant with my 3rd and last child at this point. Wow. I've got a long way to go.  Not that I am unhappy with where I am, but sometimes, it is hard to look back at what you thought you would be. I am happily married, and Madison is a far better place for me than Maine, but the house and the kid thing kind of bothers me a smidge. I took for granted that when I got married, I would be buying a house. It all seems so easy when you are a kid. Now, I have set me goal to be that before Ashley starts high school I want a house, that gives me 7 years. I only hope that is not too optimistic. *sigh* Friday night we went to Rossario's, which has the best Italian food EVER!!!  It is a small little restaurant with red and white checkered table cloths and the waitresses seemed to know most of the patrons by name.  That didn't make it feel any less welcoming to us though. Ashley was treated kindly and with patience, and we were given great service. The food was to die for, I can't wait to go back!  Yesterday, we headed down to Art Fair on the Square, which was nice, but so so crowded.  It is hard to browse and appreciate art with 150,000 sweaty bodies crammed in next to yours. We ended up at the Union for ice-cream and then home.  I made the best dinner. We had Tilipia filets with garden fresh green beans and baked potatoes. It was a simple dinner, but I put a lot of love into it, and it tasted so good. Then for my birthday movie, we watched Popeye. I used to love that movie as a kid. It is not like I remember it (nothing ever is) but it was still enjoyable. Today, I have decided to skip church, give my hubby a haircut and read the paper until my parents come up for a trip to the zoo and a picnic.   I would have rather had the day alone with Christopher and Ashley, but I think the guilt thing of never recognizing my birthday as a child has gotten to be too much for them to bear. They had to be here. Mom wanted to take me out to a nice restaurant for lunch, dad was the one with the picnic idea.  It is funny how much better he knows me and my desires more than my mom ever could. Maybe just that he tries, and she just thinks that whatever will please her will please everyone else. Either way, It is nice to feel that at least one of my parents knows me a bit.  The birthday girl is off to give a haircut.

      I am beginning to realize that being poor doesn't rock, but it isn't an issue when it comes right down to the way other people feel about you as a person.  Ths new guy's name is Ned and he is very very cool.  He met my Dad and my Dad's fiance today and they really like him.  That matters a lot to me because I respect their opinions.  (No, he isn't the roomy)  I hope you come back relaxed!

      So who is this new guy?  iS it the room mate?  You'll need to give me details. We are leaving tomorrow for the cabin.  I hope that it is okay, I am kind of dreading it.  I feel like we are the failures of the family. I always walk away from family gatherings feeling more useless and poor.

      Hi.....looky thals I'm using your blogger thingy-magig.  I wrote comments to two of your posts now i'm putting in my own message, aren't you proud?  So, whats up with Tammy?  Well I'm glad you asked.  My arm muscles hurt.  I was helping a friend move yesterday for 6 hours.  kinda sucked my ass.  but they fed me pizza, so it was cool.  I lifted more than the men cause they were wimps and just wanted to play video game.....what loosers (I say as I spend my free time writing down what happend to me yesterday on a computer.....oh well, my mom thinks I'm cool) Oh and there was this guy who reminded me of my 14 year old brother only he was 19.  He thinks he's part cat and often meows loudly. At our first meeting he repeatedly rammed his head into an elevator door and burped real loud....charming fellow.  and there was this other guy who reminded me of robert (my 19 year old brother)  He was scruffy and had the drug addict look, Erika would have found him attractive.  but I think he was trying to hit on me.  Me and Vicky (the girl I was helping move) were talking about Olando Bloom *swoon*  and she was getting all it and mentioned something about tying him up with a silk scarf.  and I made the comment nothing wrong with a little bondage.  then later when me and his guy were in the elevator, he was like " so, about that comment you made earlier, you like bondage?"    they he began to ask me if I was single and how he picks up girls and how he was in the market for a girlfriend, and I wanted to throw up and tell him how creepy this all was because he reminded me of my brother, but I didnt' want to hurt his feelings so I just took the stairs.  Then I was talking to vicky and she was telling me that he was slightly autistic, but not like normal autism.....its just like he's mentally imature.  he's 23 but he acts like a 15 year old, then I felt bad for almost throwing up. O.k, well I have to go to work *grumbles incoherently* so I'll catch y'all on the flip side.  Oh yeah, hi Tracy, Nikol (sp?)and anyone else who is on this server whom I haven't met.  Tootals :)

      These are probably really old, but I enjoyed them.  http://www.rumdesign.com/wrong I don't know if the slash after wrong matters.  http://www.chriselkins.com/insane1.htm  http://www.phobos-deimos.com/Humor/stare%202.htm I braced for this one so it wasn't as cool.   I don't care if nobody likes them.  My mom thinks I'm cool.    Nikol.  I think you're crazy!  You are not gaining weight!!  (probably not the best thing to say) But even if you are, you'd still be hot.  I've seen you chunky.  You'd still have the same appeal.

      Thalia, I have to tell you that I am waggling my finger at you.  I think I am gaining weight right now and I sure hate it.  Thing is, you have a very very very very very nice body.  You need to stand yourself in front of the mirror a few more times.

      Let's see.  Today I had a 7'45 am workout scheduled.  It kinda happened.  I'm not to enthusiatic about this quest for a thinner me.  Not that I'm partial to my back fat or anything.  It's just too hard!!  If there were no thai restaurants or cinnamon candies or sausage mcgriddles at Mcdonalds or pepperoni pizzas from Pizza Hut, I'd be thin.  And perhaps if my mom's side of the family didn't resemble hippos.  Those are the things keeping me fat!!!  I have to get away from them.  Well, away from everything but the Thai food and the cinnamon candies.  And my mom's side of the family.  I'm eating  one of those vegetable medley thingys.  It has broccoli, baby carrots and cauliflower.  Mmm mm good.   I wonder if my breath smells as bad as my tongue tastes.  All the people I must be offending right now.  Oh well.  But that's all.  I have a mental issue and I just wanted to share it with the one other person who reads this, Nikol.  Seeing as how none of my other friends can take time out of their busy schedules to look at it, Tammy, Tracy, Robin, Mike, Frank.

      I have realized today that I need a new job.  It's not that I hate my job, I just don't like it much.  I mean, I get paid to sit and walk.  Things that I would normally do at a job, but in conjunction with a shit load of other stuff.  Well, I do answer phones.  I actually hate that part of the job.  Between 4 and 7 that damn thing never stops.  Today was horrible though, I took one hit off my cigarette before it burned out because so many fucking people were calling.  I s'pose that's what I'm here for.  But some days I don't want to be.  I think I might just move to Nevada and whore.  (I wonder if Mike has read this recently.) Just kidding.  Not that I think it's wrong, I just don't think it's right for me.   I have decided to find a sugar daddy, but not an old one.  But not a young one.  Middle aged would be good.  He has to be tall at least 5'10, I have an issue with height.  He can't be skinny.  I don't like skinny people, as a matter of fact I hate them!!!  I just want to kidnap them and force feed them cheddarwursts and macaroni and cheese.  (I wonder if she knows I'm talking about her...)  But that would be cruel.  Sorry.   I don't want a sugar daddy anymore.   There's this cute guy that works at the building that I protect.  There's always a cute guy in my life.  One that I will never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever speak to.  Because I'm retarded.  I have this thing...Sometimes I don't care what people think of me, especially guys.  It's that whole "share my life take me for what I am, cause I'll never change all my colors for you...", but then when there is a guy I'm interested in I just assume that they have absolutely no interest in me whatsoever, so I don't bother trying.  I don't bother holding conversations, I don't laugh when they do things that I think they think are funny, even if they are funny cause I just assume that didn't do them to make me laugh.  I think that's sad.  Oh well!!!  I don't like dating anyway.  And I don't like sex either.  That's funny.   I have nothing more to say.

      There is absolutely nothing going on in my life today.  My tumor is better Nikol.  I danced at the cafe and I was only in a little pain the next day.  Oh, there's this show called Dead Like Me.  Its the greatest show I've seen in a long time.  It's on DVD, Season's 1-3.  But season 1 is only the pilot.  That wasn't cool.  But I know your DVD player isn't hooked up, but if they have it on vhs you should watch it.  There's a lot of swearing and dark humor, it's great!!  Okay, that's all for now.

      I have the coolest titles, don't I?  Well, last night I went to Have A Nice Day Cafe (which will be refered to as the cafe from this point).  Had fun.  There was this guy there that looked a lot like ashton kutcher???.  He was cute.  He was getting married and not out looking to fuck someone, but just wanting to mingle.  But he kept getting shot down.  Poor guy.  So, I brought him to my circle o' friends and he danced with us.  He was happy then.  He gave me a kiss on the cheek and thanked me for dancing with him.  It was cool.  I was pretty drunk.  It's cool though.  I've had this change...my friends say I'm growing as a person but...I don't go to clubs looking for attention anymore.  I used to get all dolled up, but now I just throw on some jeans and a tee and a little makeup and hit the road.  It's cool.  I feel good about that.   Today we got a phone call from our friend Nicci.  It's her last day in town and we are going to hang out with her, hopefully.  She's the third in our group to get married.  Crazy people gettin' married all the time like they ain't got no sense.  Oh, I don't mean that.  Whatever makes them happy.  And for the most part they seem to be.  So, yea.  Well, that's all that's happened in the past 24hrs.  I think.  PEACE

      You were born in the falls of winter I was born in the midst of spring with a vengeful streak and fiery temper And you the disposition of a Snow Queen  You were always so soft but spoken I was never the type to walk away in peace You had a weaker side, Did I make you stronger? Why I'd ever doubt your need for me...  Cause we are, what we are And we are, who we love And I'm not full of changing But I am full of me  So if I decide to compromise And if you understand my point of view When I come round just be on my side And I'll do the same for you  Cause we are, what we are And we are, who we love And I'm not full of changing But I am full of me  I'm angry and depressed at times And you're crazy and always pressed for time But we're still here, after all those times And we'll be here, And we'll be here  Cause we are, what we are And we are, who we love And I'm not full of changing But I am so full of me  Hope you like it!!

      It really bothers me when people start to put "solvable predicaments" before their friends when they've only been in the freakin' relationship for a week.  I know there's a honeymoon phase, but when someone says, "oh, I'm trying to stop completely ditching you guys when a boy comes in the picture" and then they turn right around and do it again, well it makes me think that they're just a lying asshole.  I know I'm being just a tit harsh, but it happens every fucking time.  And I'm sick of saying -- oh that's just how she is.  Cause people shouldn't ditch people when new people come in their lives unless the old people are bad people and the new people are...unbad people.  There, I think I've said it all.  ERIKA!!!!  Well, maybe I'm just being an asshole.  But what's new.

      It would be nice if you have.  I went to the dentist today cause I had an effing toothache. Now, I feel better. My doctor gave me vicadin. It's not real vicadin, though. The pain just stopped all of a sudden. But it was after Mike made me cry. I asked him to work for me cause I didn't feel great and I didn't want to deal with this place while I was in pain. It only makes it feel more like hell. And I begged him and begged him and he said he'd think about it, but he wasn't serious. I didn't find that out until I called him to ask if he'd decided. Then, I begged and begged some more and he said I can't and I'm hanging up. I was sad then. Not so much now, cause I feel better. But I was then.  The date of the conception of Mike and Heather's quadruplets will be December 13, 2004.  I feel much better now. :P  It's going to cost 700-900 dollars for my root canal. Otherwise I could just get the tooth pulled. But anyone who knows me well knows that I'm just a little too vain for that. It's the 2nd tooth(going back) from my fang. Yes, I have fangs!!  Seen any good porn lately? I haven't. It's funny though. I heard from one of my friends that one of my other friend's husband was mad at her (his wife) because he found out that she was 'entertaining' herself without him. The porn was in a different spot. He went all bitch on her. Like he normally does. I don't understand why guys are that way. Don't they know that if we wanted someone as feminine as us, we'd marry chicks. I don't want a guy who would get angry if I called him a chunky bastard one day. Not that I would call him a chunky bastard. I would if he knew he was chunky. Cause, you know how someone people live in denial. They swear they are still a size 10 just because the button hasn't popped off and clocked Tracy in the eye yet. Hell I've been there.  I want another cigarette.  Ladies when we go camping in August I think we should bring the vodka and the potatoes. VODKA POTATO BASEBALL!!!!!  I'm really looking forward to being away from work. Doing something fun.  I'm officially back to pt August 22. Then I'll have about 2 weeks of freedom. I think I might take the full two weeks off to do absolutely nothing but wallow in self pity. I haven't been able to just dwell on shit that's beyond my control since I started this damn thing.  I have to go do my round, but I'll be back to add on to this blog in an hour or so.  K, I'm back now.  I was thinking that maybe I should buy a dog.  I want a dog.  Dogs are pretty.  I want a mouse too.  A gray one or brown one.  Then, I will make it a little hat and a red and white striped shirt and I will call him gus.  Like Gus-gus from cinderella. One time, when I was in the hospital, my mom's friends bought me a giant stuffed rat.  I called him Gus-gus.   I don't know why I came back.  S'not like I had something to talk about.

      Jackie sucks.&nbsp; She can't give advice.&nbsp; Everytime I ask her for advice she stares at me blankly.&nbsp; I can see the question marks forming in her pupils... I guess it's not so fair that I'm writing this about her knowing that she doesn't read it.&nbsp; But I told her that she sucks at giving advice.&nbsp; So, it's not so bad.&nbsp;  I hate my job.&nbsp; I hate my job.&nbsp; I hate my job.&nbsp; My brother has a job.&nbsp; A good job.&nbsp; Fucker better keep it.&nbsp; We're moving to these apartments in Racine IF I find a good job, either third shift or bartending, and if he keeps his job.&nbsp; I wouldn't mind staying in Racine&nbsp;I guess.&nbsp; I'd rather be in Milwaukee, close to school and bartending.&nbsp; But&nbsp;who cares.  I'm reading this book called ghost hunting to prepare for my first case as a paranormal investigator.&nbsp; So far I've learned that...I've learned stuff.&nbsp; A lot.&nbsp; Some things I already knew.&nbsp; Good book.  I think that I'm just going to follow through with my original plan.&nbsp; I'll go to gateway and take that responsible drinking class or whatever it is and then I'll just try and get a job around here for a month.&nbsp; Then try and find one in Milwaukee.&nbsp; I just need to be away from this place.&nbsp; For a really long time.  I'm thinking about my bills a lot.&nbsp; Not as much as I used to, it's less stressful now.&nbsp; But I owe a lot of money to a lot of companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to pay them their money, but I don't&nbsp;have any.&nbsp; So, I was thinking that maybe I could rob a bank, or fake my death, or sell my ass, or kill people&nbsp;for money.&nbsp; Well, I probably can't do&nbsp;any of that now...well,&nbsp;maybe if I kill all of you...but why would I do that?&nbsp; Nobody's paying me to.  My original plan was to&nbsp;work&nbsp;2 full time jobs...hey there's&nbsp;a cute guy.&nbsp; Just one though...anyway.&nbsp; I would have worked 1st and 2nd, but the stupid 1st shift job wanted me to work the fucking mandatory over time.&nbsp; And I couldn't.&nbsp; Everything would have worked out fine.&nbsp; 6am-2'30pm.&nbsp; Then 3pm-11pm.&nbsp; See, perfect.&nbsp; Now, 2 months later, I'm still poor as hell and struggle more so now than I was then.  I want my mama.&nbsp;  I want extensions.&nbsp; I like my little bit o' hair.&nbsp; But I'd like a longer bit o' hair for now.&nbsp; See how that's out of the question?&nbsp; Sad isn't it?  I need new clothes. Well, maybe not at this exact moment.&nbsp; But SOON I will need new jeans because I will be a size 8 and these size 12's will have to be replaced.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a wish list at american eagle everyone!!&nbsp; Go to  urlLink www.ae.com  and look for my wish list.&nbsp; Wish list is at the top of the page near the end of the list.&nbsp; I'm telling you this like you will buy it for me.&nbsp; Anyway... they ask for a person's first and last name or the email address.&nbsp; My email address is  urlLink celcebeta@mail.com .&nbsp; So go have a look.&nbsp; I have a lot of pink stuff.&nbsp; I ae had more nice shirts.&nbsp; The selection somewhat sucks now.&nbsp;  Well, I'm done.&nbsp; If there are any spelling or grammatical&nbsp;errors, oh well.&nbsp; I don't have to check them.

      I was in a really bad mood earlier today.&nbsp; I think it has something to do&nbsp;with PMS.&nbsp; I slammed a microwave door.&nbsp; Only because someone took out my food twice and left it sitting open on the counter.&nbsp; Oooh was I pissed.&nbsp; Then, I didn't want to be here anymore.&nbsp; Then my coworker called me at 10 til 7 to ask me when I'd be back, after I had call him to let him know that I would be back at 7.&nbsp; If this was the first time that had happened I would have been, like, whatever.&nbsp; But it happens a lot.&nbsp; And it gets more and more annoying every single time.&nbsp; So I told him over the radio, in a really mean tone, it's not 7 yet.&nbsp; I'm on my way.&nbsp; Grrr. That was it.&nbsp; Nothing big.&nbsp; Nothing small.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; Nothing is also better than something when something is asshole coworkers.&nbsp;  And asshole friends who steal back there game system like a thief in the night.&nbsp; You thought I had&nbsp;forgotten, huh?&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; Never.&nbsp; But now I have my snes and I don't&nbsp;neeeeed your stupid little controller with a&nbsp;whole bunch of wires and a gun and another controller and I think that's all.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, fart on your grave!!! Asshole tracybaconfat thief.&nbsp;  It is almost time for me to go home.&nbsp; I'm so very happy. Sometimes when I say SC Johnson, it sounds like assy johnson...I thought it was funny.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Hi mike.&nbsp; I read your blog.&nbsp; I didn't know you were still writing in it otherwise I would have read it alot sooner.&nbsp; As not to get too far behind.&nbsp; Boy, was I shocked to click on your name and see the novel you had written since the smelly poo incident.&nbsp; One thing though.&nbsp; It's not a comma!! It's an apostrophe.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I was having a&nbsp;"dumb" day.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a day unlike any other.&nbsp; It only comes, like,&nbsp;once a week&nbsp;or so.&nbsp; So, I don't really know anything about comma's but I know when to use an apostrophe...sometimes.&nbsp;  But mike.&nbsp; Let's talk about you.&nbsp; Do you think that because I use a lowercase 'm' when writing your name, (good comma, bad comma?) I think little of you?&nbsp; I don't.&nbsp; I just don't like taking the time to hit the shift key, hold it and then hit the m key.&nbsp; I'm lazy.&nbsp; But back to you... is heather pregnant yet?&nbsp; Is she? Is she? Is she?&nbsp; Hm...&nbsp; You know, mike,&nbsp;you don't lead a very interesting life.&nbsp; I mean, you work.&nbsp; And then you go&nbsp;to church.&nbsp; That's about it.&nbsp; See where the lack of&nbsp;interesting is?&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell us about you&nbsp;mike!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;You can't just comment.&nbsp; You have to&nbsp;post something.&nbsp; If you like I can make up an interesting story about you and heather.&nbsp;&nbsp;What'cha think??&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      'something' is herpes.  Or constipation.  Or a dead cat.  Or a big bag of spiders.   Good things:  Hey guess what I got for my birthday!!!&nbsp; A super nintendo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; I'm so happy.&nbsp; I'm so very happy.&nbsp; I played it last night and again this morning.&nbsp; I used to kick ass at super mario brothers, now I suck a little.&nbsp; But who cares, it's fun as crap.&nbsp; I'm going to play it again tonight.   Other things:  My car&nbsp;is supposed to be ready on Friday.&nbsp; Supposed to be.  I'm still trying to figure out how to go about this bartending thing.&nbsp;  I might become a paranormal investigator.&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; Only if everyone in the organization likes me.&nbsp; Otherwise I won't.&nbsp;   Bad thing:  I have a flea bite that is just a tit too close to my pubic area.&nbsp;   Rant thing:  Now, I have never had an STD before, so&nbsp;I'm finding it hard&nbsp;(in my older years) to understand why someone would have unprotected sex.&nbsp; I mean, just knowing that there&nbsp;is not much&nbsp;protecting my&nbsp;crotch from those fucking&nbsp;fleas freaks me the hell out.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just find it funny that&nbsp;after people fuck without a condom their biggest worry is "oh my god what if I'm pregnant" and not "oh my God what if my crotch rots away."   End things.   Nikol, are you moving to Milwaukee?&nbsp; If you are... take me with you.   &nbsp;

       being aggressive. I mean, mean. I'm not this way because I'm an asshole. It's simply because I don't understand somethings or I strongly disagree with them. I can't hold them in, I tend to explode under pressure.   smoking.     writing songs while having never taken the time to learn to play the piano.    playing the guitar.     starting things and never finishing them.     my job.    fleas.  I have 41 count'em baby!  41 flea bites.      military life.    tomatoes.   salad.   vegetables in general, excluding baby carrots.     cucumbers especially.   flowers.  They smell funny and then they die.   being poor.   driving everywhere I have to go.   not knowing how to accomplish anything in reality.  In my head I'm SuperThalia!!   having a 1.9 GPA.   striving to become more than average.   boinking.   being overweight.   wearing the inner thigh of my jeans away because my fucking thighs rub together.   worrying about being overweight.   my size 12 feet.   my nearsighted vision and my astigmatism.   being confronted when I can't remember the insulting comment that I made about your big nose, flabby gut, back fat, bellyroll, love handles, nose hair, chest hair, ass hair, small breasts, cankles, buthigh, or any other physical characteristic you have that may be less than perfect because 9 times out of 10, if it wasn't your teeth or height (latter only for males), I wasn't serious.   being confronted when I do remember the insulting comment I made about your way of life, intelligence level, and/or whoristic tendencies because 9 times out of 10 I meant what I said and I won't change my story simply because you found the testicular fortitude to speak your mind, assuming or hoping that I would change mine.   controlling my anger. Sometimes people piss me off and they never know it because I breathe and count and remove myself from their sight. Someday I'd like to remove them from mine.   compromising situations in public places.  (Shiver.)   guys with small penises who are in such a fucking hurry to whip them out at first sight of a pretty girl.   forgetting to call my mom back.     Neko.  He's the one that gave me fleas.  Cat bastard.   depending on someone.   doubting any part of me.    constantly thinking that maybe he/she doesn't like/love me because he/she/they did/didn't do blank.   growing up and growing apart.  No matter how you sugar coat it, it stills seems pointless now.   having to decide whether I should stay or go. If I need to I should, but if I can't afford to I shouldn't. Even though I NEED to.   my lack of privacy.  -------------------------   finding more flea bites.  43.   seeing my family in the position they are in and knowing that I can't help them without hurting them and myself.   knowing that I can't save the world...in reality.   Cause you know, in  my head I'm SuperThalia!!   finding a new job.   meeting new people.   dating. I wouldn't mind an arranged marriage. I've decided to just walk up to that stupid boy and say hey, I'm not really into this whole dating thing, so if we could skip it and just go get married that would be great.   the fact that my father is dead. Dead, dead, dead. How much does it suck when somedays you wake up and (on some level) forget that. After 5 fucking!! years. Oh, just a lil'.     I think I may have covered every dislike I have.   Everything else I can live with.       Nikol, are you sure you tried calling  everyone  Saturday??  Well, I hope Trast feels better soon and you get some grown time too.

      Anyone??  Today I talked to that stupid boy that I think/thought liked me.  Last I checked he doesn't like me.  Now, I'm pretty sure he doesn't cause I asked him out and he said no.  Well, not exactly.  I didn't exactly ask him out and so technically he couldn't have said no.  But that's kinda what happened.    I said (total pick up line now that I think about it) I wanted to ask you, do you hang around Racine at all?  Or just Oak Creek?  (the last part was a muffled whisper)  He said, just Oak Creek mostly.  I just come here for work.  (this is him rejecting me.  if it were me I would have said not really, why?  you know, leaving room for the big question or suggestion.)  I said, oh.  Then there was silence, but it wasn't awkward.  It was more like how do I go about this now.  Do I just bring up bars in the area and say he should hang out one night.  Or do I just ask him if he wants to hang out one time.  Or do I just take that as a no.  I had one of those moments that I thought only happened to Ally McBeal.  His coworkers came in from smoking.  Well, great.    Did I mention we were in the back room.  Alone.  Anyway we left there and we up front and he said if there's anything else I can help you with call back or something along those lines.  The rejection had set in by then so I wasn't really paying attention.  Then I smiled a defeated smile and said I'm good thanks and he said keep smiling.  Smiled again.  Then I left and hung my head in the car.     What's wrong with me?  Why doesn't the stupid boy like me?  If he knew I called him a stupid boy then I'd understand.  But right now I don't.  And it's annoying.

      Have you ever had one of those days?   It's good though.   This means friday will feel like saturday,  saturday will feel like sunday.  And come sunday it will feel like monday, but it won't be.  I'll have another full day off to enjoy.    I got a call from this guy Skye, he's in a band.  I was going to audition to be the lead singer, but I told him I wouldn't because I didn't want to be the cause of a shitty position if my stupid car decides it doesn't give a fuck about my having to work and go to school.  I called Kevin again and I know he wanted to abandon all of his customer service etiquette.  But I had to know somethings before I let him fix my car.  I hate not being able to trust people.  I'm so happy to be off work.  So happy.    I don't think we're doing anything this weekend for Bobin's birthday.     Nikol, I left you a vm letting you know.

      I'm working 3rd shift tonight.&nbsp; Somebody called in sick.&nbsp; Oh, well.&nbsp; I need the overtime anyway.&nbsp; I'm at the FC.&nbsp; It's cool here.&nbsp; I'm alone.&nbsp; Alone, alone, alone.&nbsp;  I have absolutely nothing of importance to say about my life.&nbsp;  But Robin is turning 25 in ten days.&nbsp; It's about that time again people!&nbsp; Celebrate good times, come on!&nbsp; Well, I don't exactly know what we are going to do for Robin's birthday, just yet.&nbsp; But I hope it involves alcohol, melted candle wax and sweaty man-body.&nbsp; Yeah, that would be fun.&nbsp;  I get to flirt with my cute guy again on Friday.&nbsp; Just to let you guys know.&nbsp; I'm not going to ask him out or anything.&nbsp; Robin said I should play with him a little more.&nbsp; And&nbsp;once I get him hooked then I can go in for the kill.&nbsp; If he decides to give up then I'll know he wasn't&nbsp;right for&nbsp;me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Riiight?&nbsp; Right!! Sometimes I think it would be pointless to be in a relationship right now&nbsp;anyway.&nbsp; I have a lot of more important things in my life.&nbsp; School.&nbsp; My family and friends.&nbsp; Bills.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, all important&nbsp;stuff.&nbsp; Bringing&nbsp;in a guy&nbsp;would be like bringing in a&nbsp;child.&nbsp; Only you can't lock this one in a closet because by all rights and purposes he should be at least half a foot taller than you and weigh a good 30lbs more than you.&nbsp; (For any of you&nbsp;who didn't know this I read it in this book called...um...short..girlie&nbsp;men...and the women who ...&nbsp;should&nbsp;be skinned alive, then&nbsp;beat&nbsp;with a switch for loving them.&nbsp; That sounds&nbsp;good right?)&nbsp; What was I talking about??&nbsp; Well, I'm gonna go&nbsp;smoke a little and try&nbsp;to&nbsp;stay awake.&nbsp;  I hope you guys have a good day tomorrow.&nbsp; Cause I know I will. You know what I just realized!!!&nbsp; These people left me alone in this place with the hanger doors open.&nbsp;&nbsp;Something could walk in here and eat me.&nbsp; WHOLE.&nbsp; Well, like half of me, then if it didn't choke to death, the other half.&nbsp; Just put yourselves in my shoes for a moment.&nbsp;  Damn people.&nbsp;Leaving these damn doors open like they ain't go no sense.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Tracybaconfat.&nbsp; Tracy.&nbsp; Bacon.&nbsp; Fat.&nbsp; TRACYBACONFAAAAAATuh!!!)&nbsp; Just felt like loving one of my friends.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I can tell he doesn't like you one bit.&nbsp; Dork. &nbsp; So, here's some cool news for you!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Ned and I are going to start looking at places together.&nbsp; You know, houses.&nbsp; Houses with more bedrooms and a yard and pets allowed and a dishwasher and a big kitchen and a great room that I can use as a studio so I can start painting again.&nbsp; He wants to keep his place in Milwaukee for a bit, but if we find some place we love we'll sign the lease and the boys and I will move in and he'll pay half the rent and move in gradually &nbsp;and wouldn't that be awesome?&nbsp; He loves me, Thalia!&nbsp; And the great shit about that is  I  love  him,  too.&nbsp; So, my question for you is, should I be looking for a place with a bedroom for you, too?&nbsp; You know, so you could live rent free in exchange for a minimal amount of childcare, go to school at a local tech place  and  hang out with me a whole lot?&nbsp;&nbsp; *waggling my eyebrows*&nbsp; The only rule of the house is that after the kids go to sleep, you have to walk around nude and maybe jump up and down a little.

      A friend of mine had a birthday party last weekend.&nbsp; I would have gone had I remembered.&nbsp; So instead, I slept.&nbsp; It was a good sleep.&nbsp; A 12 hour&nbsp;sleep.&nbsp; I&nbsp;was half an hour late for work.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was okay though because I didn't care.&nbsp; (Remember, I hate&nbsp;my job.)&nbsp;  That same friend just told me something very interesting today.&nbsp; She told me that she met, made out with,&nbsp; has the home and cell&nbsp;phone number of the lead singer from Fuel,&nbsp;he also bought her a diamond cross pendant.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, for a moment I actually thought to say, wow, I'm so jealous of you.&nbsp; But then, I realized that was a lie.&nbsp; I was in no way, shape or form jealous of her.&nbsp; I thought it was really cool that it&nbsp;happened to her.&nbsp; (Am I truly that gullible?...)&nbsp; But there was no envy.&nbsp; Just amusement.&nbsp; I like amusement, it's funna.&nbsp; I just found that whole situation interesting and had to share it.&nbsp;  Good things:  I found out the source of my bites.&nbsp; Some creature is living in my bed.&nbsp; It could be a flea or a tick, tic, whatever, or a lice or a crab.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully it's neither.&nbsp; I'd rather it be Tammy.&nbsp;&nbsp;But something bit me last night and it was actually painful.&nbsp; I thought maybe it was skin cancer.&nbsp; So, yay.   My car is in the process of getting fixed.&nbsp; JD Byrider isn't that bad of a place.&nbsp; They are letting me make payments.&nbsp; I owe Kevin a chocolate chip cookie.&nbsp; I may spit in it.&nbsp; Cause I don't appreciate being lied to, but he did put in a little effort to get the payment plan approved.&nbsp; So, yay.   Nikol, tell Ned that I will give him a cookie too if he sits with the kids while we go out and get piss drunk.&nbsp; But I won't spit in it... cause he's a nice guy...Notice how I put this under the list of good things...please don't disappoint me on my birthday...cause, um, well, maybe it's not exactly  my  birthday, but if it were, would you disappoint me?&nbsp; That would be harsh, I would never recover.&nbsp; I'd be forever afraid to celebrate my birthday knowing there was a possibility that someone would disappoint me.&nbsp; So, yay????&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Other thing:  Talked to the boy that I think/thought liked me and turns out he&nbsp;doesn't.&nbsp; What a horrible birthday.... anyway.&nbsp; I didn't find this out the hard way.&nbsp; That's a good thing.&nbsp; But this is what my spidey senses are telling me-I can't believe I just said that.&nbsp; Well he left me a message and I called him back.&nbsp; I said hey it's thals and he said hey beautiful.&nbsp; I giggled.&nbsp; He said I called you earlier and I was disappointed when I got your voice mail cause I wanted to talk to you.&nbsp; I giggled, and said!! see that's why I called and asked to speak with you.&nbsp; I said assed..not asked...not axed...assed.&nbsp; I can't pronounce the k in that word.&nbsp; And he said well, thank you that just made my day.&nbsp; I said awww.&nbsp; Then I assed him a serious question and he said just to remind him when I come in again, he said "just talk to me then.&nbsp; You have to specifically ask for me."&nbsp; I said okay, I will definitely ask for you.&nbsp; Then, say it with me class, I giggled.&nbsp; Awww, how cute.&nbsp; Excuse me whilst I choke it back.&nbsp; I'm so gay around that kid.&nbsp; I hate that.&nbsp; But it's okay.&nbsp; But seriously people what if&nbsp;he doesn't&nbsp;really like me and he's just uber nice.&nbsp; Oh well, I'll never know&nbsp;until I know.&nbsp; I think I'll write him a note.&nbsp;  That's all.

      You could lure me with your purdy eyes, instead.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I will try my darndest to get a sitter.&nbsp; Perhaps my darling Ned w0uld be willing to stay with them if it means my happiness and a night with the girls.&nbsp; He's a peach about that sort of thing.&nbsp; Pardon my funny mood here.&nbsp; I need adult company.&nbsp;  &nbsp; You know, you have a habit of calling while the kids are talking to their dad, so I don't even realize you called until hours later when I&nbsp;pick up the phone to dial 1-900-whythefuckdoesn'tanybodycallme and hear the stuttered dial tone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      It's about 4'30pm.&nbsp; I'm at work.&nbsp; I've been here since 7am.&nbsp; It's okay though.&nbsp; I only work 4 hours tomorrow.&nbsp; I talked to Tony last night and he has a friend that might be able to fix my car for a cheaper rate. That would be lovely now wouldn't it.&nbsp; Lettuce pray.&nbsp;  I'm trying to be in a better mood and smile and stuff and pretend that I'm as happy as I was about three months ago.&nbsp; I miss school.&nbsp;  I can't wait til it starts again.&nbsp; I'm going for a 4.0 this year.&nbsp; That would bring my gpa up from a 1.9 to a ... 2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Funny if it does.&nbsp; I'd cry so much.&nbsp;  &nbsp; This song describes how I feel right now: (Well, not the whole song - cuz don't nobody be rippin' my slips downtown.) (And if you change skid row to Racine...now that doesn't work.&nbsp; Just go with it people.) &nbsp; Poor!  All my life I've always been poor. I keep asking God what I'm for, and he tells me "Gee, I'm not sure.&nbsp;  Sweep that floor, kid." Oh, I started life as an orphan, a child of the street Here on skid row. He took me in, gave me shelter, a bed, crust of bread and a job Treats me like dirt, calls me a slob,  Which I am&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  So I live&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Downtown That's your home address. Ya live&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Downtown  When your life's a mess.

I'll start climbin' up hill and get outta here.  Someone tell me I still could get outta here.  Someone tell lady luck that I'm stuck here! &nbsp; Gee it sure would be swell to get outta here.  Bid the gutter farewell and get outta here. I'd move heaven and hell to get outta Skid.  I'd do I dunno what to get outta Skid.  But a hell of a lot to get outta Skid.  People tell me there's not a way outta Skid. But believe me I gotta get outta Skid Row! &nbsp; Thank you!&nbsp; Thank you!&nbsp; I'm here all week. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Today I called securitas to see if I could get an advance on my check.&nbsp; She said "no".&nbsp; I said "okay that's all."&nbsp; Then we hung up.&nbsp;  I called JD Byrider to see if the machanic (Kevin) had spoken to anyone in the office about a payment plan and he laughed and said no.&nbsp; I laughed a little too, it was 8'30am.&nbsp; I'm desparate.&nbsp; Still not desparate enough to whore, but desparate enough to joke about whoring.&nbsp; I really like using whore as a verb.&nbsp; And funner as an adjective.&nbsp; It's funny stuffin'.&nbsp; Anyway...He hadn't spoken to anyone because they weren't in the office yet.&nbsp; So, I told him that I've been calling places and pricing (trying to) used engines and the last place I talked to told me that&nbsp;he'd need the 8th digit of the vin and the date of something or another.&nbsp; My reason for calling Kevin.&nbsp; He said well, I've been doing the same.&nbsp; I said okay.&nbsp; Then silence.&nbsp; Then he said something else.&nbsp; Then silence.&nbsp; You see, I was waiting for him to say ok, here are the vin and date.&nbsp; He said nothing.&nbsp; So I said hey, can I have the vin and date?&nbsp; He said hang on a sec.&nbsp; Then he gave me the vin and said he didn't have the date.&nbsp; I said well the guy said he needs the date and it's some where on the door and he said...it's funny... he said, 'I don't have it.'&nbsp; I said okay bye.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the times I've&nbsp;been in my car I've never noticed that date, why would he?&nbsp; Maybe it wasn't there.... So, I called the guy at the place about the engine and gave him the info and he said well we really need that date and I said Kevin told me he didn't have it.&nbsp; And the other guy said 'all he had to do was open the damn door.'&nbsp; So, I told him I'd go there myself and call him back.&nbsp; The other guy was a nice guy, he still gave me a price range 500-600.&nbsp; That doesn't help.&nbsp; I was a little angry that Kevin didn't give me the date.&nbsp; I didn't think he was shady, until now.&nbsp; This is why I hate people.&nbsp; But what to do?&nbsp;  &nbsp; I need a cigarette.&nbsp; I need a new job.&nbsp; I need a new life.&nbsp;&nbsp; I need a new car.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Tam's mom was talking to me this morning about how stupid I was for always jumping in to things.&nbsp; Not her exact words, but the basic jist.&nbsp; I'm sure I needed to hear that, just not today.&nbsp; Then I mentioned that I'd just sell my bed and tv.&nbsp; And Tam's mom said you won't get much for it.&nbsp; Again, was probably the truth, just didn't need to hear it today.&nbsp;  &nbsp; So, I'm done.&nbsp; I don't care anymore.&nbsp; I'm going to pay my bills.&nbsp; I'll get the fucking car&nbsp;eventually.&nbsp; If I have to quit school for the semester then I will.&nbsp; Not like I've never dropped out of school before.&nbsp; :D&nbsp; But, I'm so tired of this shit.&nbsp; So tired.&nbsp;  &nbsp; And Nikol I work today thru next wednesday.&nbsp; I have a four day thur thru sunday and the girls and I were going to hang out&nbsp;next weekend, I think, for Robin's birthday.&nbsp; Not sure what we're doing yet, but&nbsp;if you're up for it and could find a babysitter,&nbsp;it'd be great if you could hang too.&nbsp; You have to meet all the girls and hang out with us all eventually.&nbsp; Can I persuade you with alcohol???&nbsp; C'mon, you know you want to.&nbsp; C'mon.&nbsp; Well, I'll call you tonight&nbsp;after 8 to see.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      She said I would not understand.  Slammed the door and said I'm sorry I  Had a bad day again.  &nbsp;  My car needs the engine replaced.&nbsp;  And the radiator.  And I need a front wheel bearing or baring or whatfuckingever.  Total cost: $1200.00  I had to cancel my drug testing appt at Covance.&nbsp; They would have paid me $1200.00.  Something's&nbsp;not right.  I really don't&nbsp;need this shit right now.  All I've ever wanted to do was&nbsp;provide for my family and friends.&nbsp; I can't do any of that in the position I'm in right now.&nbsp; Granted had I not provided for my family in the past I wouldn't be in this position.&nbsp; But shit happens.&nbsp; You live, you fucking learn.&nbsp; I haven't.&nbsp; So I will remain in this position until the day I set myself on fire on the east or west coast, preferably the east coast.  I wanted to cry a little today.  I wanted to quit my job.  I'm being a real shit to everyone...and I don't care.  I'm having a BAD DAY.  You know what really pisses me&nbsp;off.&nbsp;  People are smiling and waving today&nbsp;as they leave.&nbsp; I don't feel like smiling.&nbsp; I feel like saying to hell with it.&nbsp; All of it.&nbsp; All of it except my babies.&nbsp; laya, day and erra.&nbsp; I have to stay for them.&nbsp; Cause in my head, nobody loves them as much as me.&nbsp; And in reality nobody sees them less than me.&nbsp; That's sad.&nbsp; I don't have time though.&nbsp; When I do have time all I want to do is wallow in self pity.&nbsp; I like wallowing.&nbsp;  Yes, and today, it's all over 1200 dollars.&nbsp; But you have to understand the cycle.  I have a shit load of other bills.&nbsp; I've added to them 3 times in the last 4 or 5 years.&nbsp; My laptop, my car, and my credit card.&nbsp; All things that have benefited me.&nbsp; My laptop for school work, my car to get to and from school and my cc to slowly but surely rebuild my credit.&nbsp; Other shit just comes up.&nbsp; Like my dental bills and my hospital bills and the electric bill and other shit on my report.&nbsp; And every time I pay something off, something else comes up.&nbsp; And it's quite discouraging.&nbsp; Ya know.  And this fucking phone will not stop ringing!&nbsp; I hate my job!!  But that's it.&nbsp; It never ends.&nbsp; It won't ever end.&nbsp; And it sucks.&nbsp; What sucks even more&nbsp;is I can't kill myself because I don't have life insurance!!!!&nbsp; (I'm just angry, suicide is for sissies.)&nbsp; How pathetic is that?!?!  Probably not more than this blog.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      You called me a twit!!!  How could you???   Listen asshole!  I was saying if I averaged 125, but came home once or twice with more than 125, oh say, about 150, or less than 125, oh perhaps 100, I'd still manage to break even if I stayed above 100!! 125 times the 4, four, IV, 1+1+1+1 = 4 weeks in a month is 500.  100 times the 4 weeks in a month equals 400.  400 does not, will not, won't fucking ever, !!Tammy!!, equal 500.   fucktard!!

      yeay, alright, yeay!  *does a little birthday dance* thanks thals.  I would say you were the first to wish me a happy b-day today, but it was actually e-online who sent me a b-day greeting.  but your more important, so you win.  Yepper, I'm the big 2-3 today (why can you put "the big" in front of anything and it sounds more important, like "the big guy's coming".   big just means large, and large is another word for fat, but if one were to say "the fat guy's coming"  noone would think he's important, just fat. I don't get it *shrugs*)  I was actually thinking about that this morning, not the fat thing, but the 23 thing.  I think I'm getting old.  I can still vegly rememer 16 and I long for it.  Well, its noon and I have nothing to do, that the only sucky part about having your b-day on a weekday, everyones working.  but thats o.k....I kinda like the me time.  although Tracy Baconfat (ha, baconfat) and Erika Sausageroll (ha, sausageroll) don't work till 3 and I am still waiting for them to call me and wish me a happy b-day. Maybe I'll go outside or something, I hear outsides nice this time of year.  I want to say away from the mall, but theres this buddah I want to buy...maybe if I don't pass by sears they won't suck me in.  (for those who don't know,I work at sears, which is in the mall.  I hate my job as well.  Thus the delema) Thals, we need to hurry up and become famous, this working for a living thing is really getting on my nerves.  Hey, are we watching inu tonight or going out, or both, I'm so confused.   Well , I'm going to go do something, so be good everyone.  comments to recent postings:  I don't like posting comments one the actually page.  Then people have to go back through and find which of the posts have been commented on.  I believe this is much more efficient  Signs  - "If I bartend and make at least $50-150 per shift, averaging $125 per shift..."    -the average would be 100, you twit.  - "I've been bitten by at least 9 creatures. Or one that's hell bent on my demise."    - sorry.....that was me.   - "And I've been gaining a lot of weight. It's genetics, man. I can't fight it."    -lol....yeah....me too....whatever helps us get through the day.

      Job related- This morning: I overslept again.   Tammy told me I was accepted at Covance.  (Latest lab rat.)  Yesterday: I figured away to earn at least $2000 a month.  No whoring involved. If I bartend and make at least $50-150 per shift, averaging $125 per shift (4 shifts) per week, I will have a monthly net income of $2000.  If I stay here and work once a week, or more, I could bring home $250+ a month.  If I make less bartending any given week, I could work an extra shift here.  There is room for error because I'm not including my paycheck from bartending because I don't know how things work in that area.  Either way, I'm pleased with my calculations.   I called this 800 number for bartending.  It's called bar careers and it's much cheaper than any bartending college ($90).  They teach you to make 50 drinks (I can't make any) and you're guaranteed employment.  Plus you get to keep the tools for an additional $30.  No extra charges, unless you relocate and would like help finding a new job bartending.  Even then it's $10/mo.  Sounds good to me.  The only thing that weirded me out was that the guy I spoke to the first time was the same guy that answered the phone the second time.  This leads me to believe it's probably basement based.  Oh well.  Health related: I'm anemic.   I'm shaking. I've been bitten by at least 9 creatures.  Or one that's hell bent on my demise.   The areas are red.  I'm black, no part of my person should be red.  At any time.   My contacts are about 2 months older than they should be.   I have a serious smoke related cough that's causing my chest to ache. My nose is stuffy. My throat aches.   It's not a cold though.  I don't get colds more than once every few years. I was lightheaded this morning.   And I've been gaining a lot of weight.  And it's not because of the suzy Q's and the Thai food and the ice cream and cake and pigs in a blanket and burger king and mcdonalds and wendy's and taco bell and pizza hut and candy bars and hot tamales and just about anything else horribly unhealthy you can think of.  It's genetics, man.  I can't fight it.    Romance related: N/A  Fast track to stardom: ...coming soon...  No-sing else, I donut think.

      Oh my God!  I'm blind, I'm blind.  I over slept this morning and was half an hour late for work.  Have I told anyone lately that I hate my job?  And I need a cigarette.  I've only had half a cigarette and I've been awake for a good hour now.   TAMMY!!!!!!  DID YOU CHECK MY EMAIL AND DELETE MY DRUNK DIALING POST.  IF YOU DIDN'T YOU SHOULD HAVE.   Nikol I think you're right.  I think he's like me.   I also think I'm still a little um... not sober.   But I'm going to attempt to do more than smile next time I talk to him, I do anyway, but I feel like a kid or something most of the time.   Yeah, still a little um...  I don't think it's good to be awake when you're sobering up.  The sleep monster comes for me in the form of a blink.  I know, I can feel it.   People keep coming into my field of vision.  I wonder if I still have drool on the side of my face.  I wonder what my hair is doing.  I wonder if that's why people are looking away from me when they walk in.  I wonder if I smell of alcohol as much as I think I do.  I can't wait til my break.  I'm taking a nap.  Naps are good.  Mmm, nap.  I wonder if this coffee will help. Have you ever had that feeling, when you're some place you'd rather not be and then you start to focus on the day being over and suddenly it is.  Neither have I, but that's what I'm going for.   Wow, there was just a weirdness in my tummy.  Oh now I think today might be ending a little sooner than I planned.

      He works at this place and I think he likes me.  He's cute.  His name is Dale.  I don't know anything else about him.  But he seems cool.  This here is what happened, this is why I think he likes me.  I came in one day and he told me my hair was cool.  (Before the pixie cut.  Oh for everyone I haven't seen, Nikol.  I cut my hair.)  Then I smiled and said thank you and he said you have a really nice smile too.  Then he reacted as if I distracted him from his work.  It was small talk from that point, that day.  Then I was there on Friday and he said, something like, I was asking myself who is this beautiful woman then I realized I had met you before.  And I said oh, you called me one day and it didn't sound like you remembered me.  He was like no, that wasn't the case.  Well, he was dealing with a customer and I noticed he kept looking at me and when he walked by me he'd smile at me.  Then when he was done with that guy I walked over and he said I purposely rushed through that so I could help you.  And of course I just cheesed.  Then, we made small talk and at one point he said you know, you're a really cool person.  Then it was small talk again.  This is why I think he likes me.  He's cute.  I think he's cute.  But I don't know if he likes me or if he's just a really nice guy.  Hmmm.

      Turns out I'm not a hardcore Christian.  Turns out I'm not even Christian.  Go fucking figure.  I had this hour long conversation with my friends the other night about religion.  I believe in God, not totally appreciative of Jesus and Mary.  So, instead of calling it Christianity because that's how I was raised, I've decided that I'm not calling it anything.  I'm not Atheist and I'm not Agnostic.  I don't doubt there is a God.  I totally believe that there is a higher power.    ...of this so, this is the last religious post I'm ever doing.

      Today isn't even over, yet I know it won't progress.  Life sucks.  My job sucks.  Not today's job.  Switchboard.  It's fun here.  I just don't like being a security guard.  It's not fun.  It's stupid and I hate it.  I'm whinning now.  Does whinning have 1 'n' or 2?  I donut care.  I donut.  I donut.  I donut.  I think it would be a funner word if they changed do not to donut.  I donut want to go.  I donut like green eggs and ham.  I like donut...s.  Look at it.  It's weird.  donut donut donut donut donut donut donut donut.  Is it weird for you yet? donut donut donut donut.   Oh, but today...I talked to Nikol.  Everything is peachy keen.  She's getting used to being treated (by Ned) like she's worth more than she'll ever know.  I'm happy for her.  A lot of guys are assholes.  She scored.  Go Nikol, it's your birthday.  We gon' party like it's your birthday, we gon' sip bacardi like it's your birthday.  Cause you know we don't give a **** cause it's your birthday.  Hey, when is your birthday, Nikol? I drank bacardi one time.  I got soooooo drunk that it started to taste like water. I drank gin one time.  I got soooooo drunk that it started to taste like water. I drank E&J one time.  I go soooooo drunk that it started to taste like water. I drank beer one time.  Then I threw up.  Too much liquid in my belly. I know my limit now.   4 shots of doctor, 2 shots of hot sex, 3 mixed drinks, 2 shots of really hard stuff, 2 beers...on a full stomach. Otherwise it's just 2 beers and 2 shots of anything. Whatelse about today? My car is a piece of shit.  No it's not, I love my car.  It's a good car.  It just has some bad parts.  They are getting replaced on wednesday.  It's gonna be over $300 and I really don't have the money to pay for it.  So, they are just going to have to work with me.   Well, I think that's all.  Oh, I got an peanut m&m today that was all chocolate.  I wasn't impressed.

      I just ate the biggest peanut m&m I've ever seen.  The peanut wasn't that big but that's okay.  The candy coating and chocolate shell was huge.  And mighty tasty.   I have 48 minutes left of work.  And three mediocre sized m&m's left.  Whatever shall I do?!?!?!   It's still okay.  I have a green one, an orange one and a blue one.  It's really weird.  They look kind of cool sitting on a sheet of white paper.  Cause, you know, the colors are so bright and the paper is white so...yeah.  Sorry.  I'm just really bored.  I want to nap.   45 minutes to go.   Oh no!!  Something happened to my orange m&m.  I think I ate it.  I'm ashamed now.  Wow, that made a lot of difference.  Now the other two just look blah.  It was the orange one that was making it look cool.  What have I done!   Anyway.   And another one bites, and another one bites, another one bites the dust.  No more blue!   42 minutes left.   I think I need a fashion makeover.  Ooh! ooh!!  I talked to Tammy last night about this, I think my biological clock is broken.  It ticks normally for a while then it just stops.  Then it shakes and ticks once, then shakes some more.  Then it's normal again.  I think I need a penis.  One of my very own.  I will love him and hug him and call him George.  Unless his name isn't George.  And I'm pretty sure I wont love him.  At least not in the brain malfunction-y kind of way.  In more of a physical sense.   33 minutes. I can't wait until I'm famous.  Then I can finally marry Mel Gibson.  And sleep with Johnny Depp.  The Depp.  Them will be the days!!  You know, I never really liked Johnny until I saw Don Juan DeMarco(???) like, 6 months ago.  I still don't know what Robin sees in Tom Cruise.  He's okay.  Nothing special.  I think I'd have to pass up the oppurtunity to sleep with him.  *whispers* he's short.  But James Marsters, you know even if he was 5'5 I'd find a way.  I love him.  Not as much as I love Mel Gibson, but it's love all the same.  I don't love Johnny.  I just like him a lot.  I could miss a movie he was in.  But not Mel or James. 23 minutes. I'm still sleepy.  The phones have stopped ringing.  Nevermind. This really happened today, I thought it was humorous.  I kept it to myself though.  Until now. (slightly one sided.) Me - SC Johnson this is Thalia. Him - murr murr murr. Me - I'm sorry??? Him - murr murr murr. Me - Um...Escort Services? Him - Yes. Me - I... don't... understand. Him - murr murr murr. murr murr. murr. murr murr murr. Me - Ohhhhh! Export Services!! Ha. Him - (dead silence) Me - Sorry. (click)   11 minutes left and now I'm done.

      I tried to post this as a comment and it didn't show it... so I'm making it a new post. You've got a Stupid blog. *shakes head*  My poem to Thalia. Because she was mad at me. And insecure because she didn't think I loved her... when in truth, She just didn't see how. I did. And do. So there. Now I have to remember the poem again. Blah! Stupid Blog!     You and Me  No matter what happens in life Or where our paths should lead us... No matter if we live till we're ninety Or if sharks come tomorrow and eat us.  No matter if I work second shift Or if you have two jobs. No matter if we're getting along Or if, sometimes, we're at odds.  No matter if we go off to school Or you move far away. No matter if you think I'm cool My mom does anyway.  No matter if you go work in Nevada And catch a skeevy rash. No matter if I lose my job And become trailer trash.  It doesn't matter, on a given day, Which one of us is hotter. And it doesn't matter if I end up gay And you turn out to be not...ter.  No matter who I'm dating Or who you choose to see. No matter if I'm mad at you Or if you're mad at me.  No matter if you hold a grudge Or I turn my shoulder cold. No matter if we can see our faults Or if, sometimes, we need to be told.  No matter what life throws at us Or who we grow to be... We'll always be what we are now, Simply You and Me.  I assumed, my Friend, that you knew this already, But it will do you good to hear it... You will never walk this Earth alone, So don't you ever fear it.

      This bugged me.  Read some of April (recent newsletters) before you continue. http://www.lasttrumpetministries.org  I do not understand people!!  Illuminati??  Witchcraft??  Mel Gibson!!  This guy, organization, whatever, attacked Harry Potter (audio on home page) because it's teaching us (maybe kids, mainly) that witchcraft is good and fun.  He said something about the wizard of oz too.  I don't understand it.   There are two kinds of Christians.  There are the hardcore Christians, such as myself, and there are those psycho christians, this guy.  We, hardcore Christians, will pray, thank God and joke about Jesus making Tammy fall in the dog water all in one breath.  But psycho Christians also pray and thank God, but then they try to force others to do the same.  I don't think that's cool.  People have a right to believe in whatever helps them get through the day.  If it's knowing that God sacrificed his only child for us, then great.  If it's because **Robin knowledge goes here**, great!  That doesn't bother me.  I must admit that I don't like Satan worshipers though.  Animals should not be sacrificed, that's what children are for.     I don't read the bible, it's more of a point of reference for me.  It'd be better if the index was more specific.  That way, if you were considering killing someone you could just look through K's, find kill and read all the scriptures about killing and hopefully see that it's wrong.  If nothing else, at least you'll have made an informed decision.  But, (paragraph point) I don't think the bible was meant to be followed to a T.  If so, what's the point of us being here, we'd only be living to die.  It makes absolutely no sense to me.  I'm going to live my life.  I won't kill anyone, partially because the bible tells me not to and partially because I think it's wrong.  I won't steal.  I'll try not to covet my neighbor's wife...I'm only human.  But, I won't do anything to intentionally harm another person.  How's that?  I'm pretty sure the God that I pray to thinks that I'm a dandy person.  I would have to agree with him.   I had a whole lot more to say, but I don't want to anymore cause believe it or not, I've just bored myself with talks of religion.     Can't believe he mentioned mel gibson.

      yep, its only 7 days, thats right, one week till my birthday. Hazarr!  not like i'm in any hurry to turn 23, I just like birthdays :)  Thanks for the blog about my age thals, it only took me an hour to stop crying, no harm done. *wipes away a tear*  my van has been making this rattleing sound for a couple days now.  kinda like its scraping metal against the pavement, but nothings hanging off.  But good news, it stopped making the sound today.  Can anyone guess why?  Thats right, because whatever was making the sound fell off at the corner of west blvd and haven ave.  My sister took the van to work and called me to let me know this interesting fact. So i went out to go look for the parts and all i found was an old muffler in some guys yard.  might be ours, might not.  guess if the van is making noise that could wake the dead it might be ours.  *shrugs* I'm getting my hair streaked today.  My sis (robin) gave me an early b-day present and said I could get whatever I wanted done to my hair.(origoto nechan! - sound it out, I don't know how to write in Japanese)  My first choice was blonde wih blue streaks, but then I probably would have gotten fired and i like money so I'm settleing for golden blonde with light blonde and read streaks.  I'm not too olo for that style, am I?  If you say yes, so help me god I will find you in your home cut off your legs, set your house on fire and watch as you drag your stumpy ass through the bazing inforno!  but be honest :)  We'll see what happens, its only hair, it'll grow back....but your legs won't!    Sorry, sometimes I get a little angry.  'k, well, I have nothing more to say and I'm hunry, so bye.

      Yeah, I didn't go.  If my mom was there I would have been.  I love my family but I don't know those people.  I don't really know what makes them good.  I haven't seen it in a long time.  I can honestly say that there are a few of them I'd only do something for because I'm a Christian.  That's sad.  I don't even know some of their names.  First or last.  Someone asked me what were the last names of the families, all I knew was Jackson.  That's it.  Oh well.   I miss my mama.  Even though she called me fat.  Well, she never really said hey you're fat.  But if I gained weight she'd ask if I was pregnant and when I lost it she'd ask if I was anorexic.  Sometimes I wonder what she would have said had I answered yes to either of those questions.  It's funny to think about.  Anyway, despite all that I still miss her.  She'll be here sometime this year.  I hope.  She'd better be here.  Otherwise she's gonna get it.  She's a crazy woman.  She encouraged me to be a stripper.  I was never a stripper, but when I was contemplating it, she said go for it.  Regardless of what anyone says I think that's cool as hell.  Which would you rather hear?  You're nasty. Or... go for it?  I made my own decision ultimately, but it was good to know that she wouldn't have hated me if I made the "wrong" one.  Well, Dead Like Me is getting better and better.  Season two starts the last week of July.  I plan to be there.  Oh yeah.  I do.  Happy day that is supposed to be the 4th of July but is actually the 5th...everyone!!  9 or maybe 8.  Wait a minute...yeah it's 9 more days til tammy's berfday!!!

      Tammy will be 23 years old in like 10 days.  That number feels right.  Maybe 9 or 11.  Anyway.  Her birthday is July 14.  She'll be nearly a quarter of a century old.  Almost 2 and a half decades.  Practically 1/40 of a millenia.  She'll be knockin' on thirty before she knows it!  She's already capable of remembering events that took place TWENTY YEARS AGO! TWENTY YEARS AGO!!!    She'll be as old as me.  Today Begins the Countdown to Tammy's Birthday.  It's not even a golden birthday, so I don't know why I'm doing this.  Well, probably because I never got to do it before.  Well, I guess.  It's cool though.  Everyone will know it's Tammy's birthday and they'll all say Happy Birthday Tammy!  Yeah, that is cool.    Why does it look like I just held a conversation with myself?  Robin, my sweet dear Robin, Rob, Bobbin.  It's okay.  You'll be as OLD as Nikol.  Maybe you, Nikol, Erika and Ariel can get together and start a quilting club.  Yeah, it would be cool.  You guys could make your very own special quilts that allow circulation of cool air, so that the hot flashes don't keep you awake when you hit menopause... real soon.    Aren't I the greatest friend in the world!!  I love you guys and you know I'm just kidding.  Besides, quilting is for losers.  So, just to recap, Robin is old.  Tammy is old.  Nikol is old.  Erika is old.  Ariel is old.  Tracy is old.  I don't know how old Maria is, but let's just call her old!  And I too am old.    Robin, 26 more days. Tammy, 10 more days. Nikol, how you doin'? Tracy and Maria, stay gay!! Mike, oh!!  I forgot you're old too, but not as old as Frank.    I can't really make fun of Frank though, he hasn't started reading this yet.  I'd rather my friends know that I'm talking shit about them.    Any who, Mike, I have the thing!!  I was gonna give it to you today but I forgot it.  When you get it you have to promise that it will be displayed somewhere so Karen can see it.  After she sees it you can throw it away...or give it back to me.    Okay, that's all for now.

Well, I'm not having it, dear.    As for the kids, we three adults sat around after they left and talked about how well behaved they are.  Bring them back any time.

        I took the kids to Whitewater today to play with Nikol's kids.  They had a lot of fun.  Nikol didn't seem to think the worst of them so I'll probably take them up again one day soon.  Not like tomorrow, but the kids'll still remember one each other.     I had an issue today.  One that I haven't had since I was in high school.  You know how when you're chillin' in a room with a bunch of cool kids and you're all nervous and stuffin' cause you're so worried about saying or doing something and looking really dumb.  Well, it was kinda like that only they weren't a bunch of cool kids, not that they aren't cool, but they were three really intelligent people and I wasn't worried about looking dumb, I was worried that (as Robin commented) a bit of my true self would emerge and they would all throw up a little once they realized how dumb I am. (In case they haven't already.  Realized it, not thrown up.)  I don't really care when it comes to unimportant things, but I'd say one's intelligence level is somewhat important.  That's what I'd say!  So, Nikol, John, Ned, please don't think that I was being an asshole and isolating myself from you guys just..cause...I'm...an asshole.  I just get a little intimidated around smart folks.  To all who read this, THIS IS MY ISSUE AND I'LL HANDLE IT TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITIES.  That's really all I can say on that.  I can fix it and I will.  Whether I realize I am somewhat intelligent or I read an entire set of fucking encyclopedias.  No, Mike, there is no such thing as a set of fucking encyclopedias.  Oh, wait.  Maybe there is.  Anyway, won't change by tomorrow.  So, I'm just hoping nobody thought (even if it was followed by a 'so what') that I must not like them.  Okay.  That's all.

      Pretend you're me for a second. You're superficial, snotty, exceedingly rude, possessive, arrogant, and extremely inappropriate. Are you there yet? Good. I just want you to try and understand what type of person can have this kind of reaction to a specific type of situation. I don't think I overreacted. I don't think I expect too much.  Well, this is just to get something off of my chest. It's my blog.  So okay, here goes.  Dear Tracy,  I just heard from Robin about what happened last week/earlier this week. Really sorry to hear that. Just kind of wandering why I didn't hear it from you? I realize that this is probably something that wasn't really that big of a deal, but the way Robin explained it, I think it was. But who cares, right? I don't really want to talk about this...at all. I'd just like to explain why I feel this way, in my blog. If you read this and you want to comment go for it, if not, cool. It's just that I know that we've had these talks so many times and I'd rather avoid it this time as much as you would, because obviously neither of us were listening to eachother. I continue to expect things of you and you continue to not deliver. Well, I think that it would be nice if you felt the need to update me on your life. I don't think that you ever will. I remember I told you a while ago that I'd like to be apart of the good and the bad. Maybe it was nothing. Maybe it was something. Maybe you got it out of your system. Maybe you just didn't think to tell me. Wouldn't that last one suck? Well, I don't really know how to react to this. I'm actually hurt that I heard it almost a week later from Robin. But maybe it just wasn't important. I don't know the reason. I don't really care to. I just had a bitch.

      Well, again with the well.  The stupid boy hasn't called.  I talked to Chris today, like, just now.  Chris is this boy that lives in Minnesota, he's in college and all there.  He works with me until the 22nd of August.  Anyway, I just needed a male perspective.  I need one just about everyday to try and understand this.  If he didn't want to hang out why take the number.  I don't.  I really don't.  If some guy offers me his number and I'm not interested I say no thanks, I'm seeing someone.  If that doesn't work I'll take it, but by then I'm sure he's aware that the odds of him getting a call from me are slim to none.  So, just say no.  No. No. No, you have a right to say no!! I hate this.  I hate dating.  See why I said it before.  This is why.  I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it!!!!!  Well, my brother and I start our new jobs tomorrow night and I don't really have time to go into detail with anything, so I guess I'll have to update this during the weekend sometime.  PEACE!!!

      I hadn't posted anything today, so I decided maybe I would.  Everything is basically the same.  No calls from anyone, which means, no job, no apartment, no boyfriend type thing.  Exactly how pathetically retarded is my life??  Tomorrow I'm going to hang out with Nikol, Ned, Trast, Ayden, Laya, Day, and Erra.  Someone mentioned fishing.  I plan to watch.  I used to fish with my dad a lot when I was a kid.  When my brothers were at band or football practice, I was with him.  It was cool.  I was thinking about taking the video camera up with me, the kids would have fun with that.  They could make their own little television show.  That was fun for Tammy, Tracy and me.   It was called the Shitcom Show.  It wasn't a sitcom, more like a talk show.  We had Robin and Bobby as our featured guests.  And we were shooting live on location from Tammy and Robin's kitchen.  How cool were we!!!  I'd love to say that this was when we were around 7 or 8, but the truth of the matter is, it was about 5 or 6 months ago.  Them were the days.  I wish I had not-so-much to worry about.  Why is it so hard for someone to live alone and have what they want.  All I want is a nice apartment with soft carpeting and sound proof walls, a decent car, a job that pays well without me having to work 40 hours or more a week.  This really sucks.  Sometimes I wish my dad hadn't left the military.  It would have been cool living in different countries.  I wonder how I would have turned out.   Bottom line, I hate my job.

      None of them have called.  I hate men. That's all I deal with all the time. Men.  I told preston that I was going to marry Nicole Kidman. He looked at me funny. I told him I wasn't really... Not that I wouldn't, cause I would. She's pretty.  Anyway...Seth was supposed to call. Dave was supposed to call. And Dale gave me the distinct impression that he would call.  Seth is this really hot guy that is co-owner(?, manager) of Rain in Milwaukee. I had an interview with him. He wasn't calling "for a good time", he would have been calling to offer me a job as a bartender or server. Dave is the owner of the flat that my brother and I are interested in renting in Milwaukee. It's not the greatest place in the world, but it would be good for now with some new carpeting. I'm kinda hoping that he doesn't call, that way we won't have to move right away. I have a shit load of bills that I would love to pay before I went back to part time and moved out. And Dale, aka the stupid boy, just didn't call. I thought that maybe he would, but he has not. Preston said to be patient. It's only been 2 days. I will try. Even if he doesn't call I will be fine. Just kinda want him to.  And to all of you who know me well: I just caught a glimpse of the reflection of my fingers as I was typing this and it kinda freaked me out a little cause I thought it was a giant spider. Yes, I am retarded.  And you're all... I can't remember what I called you guys yesterday... assholes ... dill holes ... butt plugs ... fuck tards ... bastards ... crotch monsters ... your mom? Well, whatever it was, you're defintely still 'it' today for not posting.  Bastards.

      Well, it wouldn't suck so much if I weren't stuck here with this one guy. I'd hate to have to re-populate the world with him. I can't stand ugly people. They make me feel so...so... oh I don't know, they just give me the creeps. I just had a funny thought. Whenever I say I don't like someone and someone asks why, I'll say cause they're ugly. I'm not really that mean. Just thought it would be funny to say. Not funny? Oh well. But someone post something...  Tammy, how's work and class scheduling going? Robin, tell us about the hot guy with the body at work. Nikol, how are the boys and how was the wedding? Tracybacon, how's work and everything? Maria, oh sweet Maria.  I have this problem with Maria. See, she's not a drinker. She's in Wisconsin, and she's not a drinker. Don't comment Mike. That's just wrong on, like, a hundred and fifty different levels. She's leaving in a month and she's not even trying to build up her tolerance to alcohol. She doesn't understand why we drink to the point where we throw up...but what she doesn't realize is that this is a trial and error type of thing. You're not gonna do 10 shots of anything and expect to be somewhat sober, until you drink 15 shots of anything a couple of times and throw up. It's okay to drink and throw up if you're just trying to find your limit. But she's like 23. She's not getting any younger. We have to do something about this people.  Anyway, Maria, oh sweet Maria, comment allez-vous?  Well, you guys suck right now and you will all suck tomorrow too unless you post something. Nikol and I have been the only ones posting recently.  Rat bastards!!!

      What do you think would happen if 2/3 of the states split from the union? Serious question people. Is it just me or does anyone else think that that would be one  GIANT STEP IN THE WRONG DIRECTION?    I just had a conversation with shane and preston.

      Once upon a time in a land far, far away, there lived a beautiful maiden named Heather.  Heather lived in a ginormous castle...somewhere...Anyway, she lived there with her mother and father and her - an unknown number to none - siblings.  They were a nice family, all good and Christian-like, in a good way it seems.  Then, one day this guy named Mike came to their castle.  Mike had some reeeeally big ears.  I'm talking huge.  And they stick out... I mean stuck out.... really far from his head.  And it was funny too, because at one time, when he had long hair, he would tuck it behind his ears.  That's not a very pretty image is it?  Well, it got funnier because then Mike SHAVED HIS HEAD!!!  That was a funny day.   Well, anyway...they got married and lived happily ever after.  And are expecting their first child or children really, really soon.  I AM NOT BALD!!  I was having a rough time...with the stress...you know, the stress, it's not good...I was stressed!!!  Damn it!!!!!  Talking bout people like he ain't got no sense.  That's why you got those big ass ears, cause you're mean!!!

      I DID IT!!!  I asked the stupid boy out!! Well, not really. I gave him my phone number and told him that he should call me if he wanted to hang out onetime. There was a lot of small talk this time. I intentionally continued to talk in hopes that something would come up and it did. I told him that since he's never been to the cafe that I'd have to take him one day (yeah I said that!!) and he said that would be fun. And then we just talked about other stuff and I said hey, I'm gonna take initiative and say here is my number call me.... So, we'll see what happens next. He's cute and funny. And he doesn't seem to be a partier. But he said something that made me think he wasn't as conservative as I thought he was. He seems like a good guy. And he think I'm beauTiful. That's not the only reason I like him Robin!! I thought he was cute before that, but then I was like, okay where am I??, there's no way. Who knows, maybe he'll call, maybe he won't. Suck if he didn't, just a little though. I'm happy I did it though.  Well, my brother and I looked at an apartment today. We liked it. The landlord thought we were cool and appreciated us telling him that we had shitty credit. We'll see how that goes. My brother and I both applied to work at Gilligan's. It's attached to Rain. New patio bar with a beach and waterfall. We'll see how that goes too.  I'm really hoping everything works out okay. Not just us getting the job and apartment, but I hope that we are able to maintain everything. I think we will be able to. I'm not being a child right now. I know people are probably thinking that I'm rushing in to this moving thing like I always do. But I'm not. I've been thinking about it for almost a year. I need to do what's right for me. I don't really want to wait until it's safe. I don't want to miss out on this. I don't plan on staying in wisconsin forever. I don't even plan to finish college here. The sooner I'm able to adjust to living on a budget and all that other stuff that comes with being independent the better. I'm going to do this. If I fail miserably I hope everyone who thought that I would feels guilty as shit because this is so not a matter of knowing me and how I am. I just wish I didn't have to ask people to be happy for me.  Back to good.

      And I'm hungry.  My car gets out of the shop on friday.  Yippee!!  I could have picked it up today, but I'm working a double shift.  It's not too bad at work.  I haven't had the aching desire to run away....yet.  I hate the stupid boy now.  Bastard.  I was talking to Tammy the other day-- if I ever say that I was talking to someone and then just go on an out of this world rant...it's safe to assume that the someone I talked to was Tammy-- and we thought it would be funny if I went in angry and yelled at him for not calling me, when I was sitting by the phone expecting his call.   ***Not really what happened!!!  I was expecting, but not sitting by the phone!  It's routine.  He calls me and compliments me and I say the dumbest things possible and giggle...a lot.  That how it goes, man.  But he fucked up the rotation!  Anyway, we thought that would ensure that he wouldn't ask me out.  That way...here comes the logic...I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore.  It will just be over and done with.

      My car still isn't ready.  I won't be charged the fee for fixing this because it's there fault.  Okay so, it's safe to say that had they put everything in right the first time and not dropped my starter, I would have had my car on monday.  Now I'm not getting it until tomorrow...if all goes well.  The one thing that seriously pissed me off was that they put the same chick on the phone that I talked to yesterday.  This woman had absolutely no idea what she was talking about.  None what so ever.   You know what I love?  Nip/Tuck.  Great show.   I'm not looking forward to going to work.  So, not.  I hate my job.

      My car was s'posed to be ready on friday.  But it wasn't.  Then on Monday, but it wasn't.  Then on Tuesday, but it wasn't.  Now, I'm wondering if it's going to be fixed today.  Today marks week three of my car being in the shop.  Isn't that funny?  I didn't think so either.  I can't even remember what the problem was on friday, but on monday it was that they dropped the starter and had to replace it but it wasn't going to be dropped off until tuesday.  Tuesday, they had put the starter on, and of course replaced the engine, but the car was still running rough.  Hmmmmmmmmmm.  I took the car in because it was running rough.  They said if I got the whole fucking engine replaced, it would stop.   It didn't stop.  What would your first thought be?  Kevin, oh sweet kevin.  Well he told me that the car wasn't making any noise anymore so the problem was the engine.  Well, now they don't know why it's running rough, but they are keeping it to find out why.  And I should have it today if all goes well.  I think that's there motto.  If all goes well.  Bastards.

      After 25 minutes of careful consideration I've come to the conclusion that it would be very feasable for me to move to Whitewater.  My main reason for moving to Milwaukee is to be closer to school, while moving to Whitewater completely defeats that purpose...it adds another possibility.  I went to uww.edu and checked out the theater department, I wanted to see if it would be worthwhile to transfer, but it's not.  The tuition is like $2000 more than uwm.  I'm exaggerating, but it's in the 4somethings and uwm is 2977 including this year's increase.  Plus, I'm on academic probation and I just don't want to take the chance of not being able to pay for it.  So, I wont transfer.  But, luckily for me, this semester wouldn't have been that bad, because I only have two days of classes starting before noon.  So, I'd have plenty o' time to workout in the morning on any day and still make it to class on time.  But then I run in to the same problems: either I don't feel like driving to school or I drive there and realize I really don't want to be there, then turn around and come back home.  I just thought that instead of pushing myself to go everyday, I could just move to milwaukee and being so close, I wouldn't have any reason not to go.   So okay, let's list the pros and cons of moving to ww vs. milw. Pro:  Nikol is there. Con:  It's further away from school than Racine. Pro:  It's rent free in exchange for babysitting. Con:  That one doesn't really matter because my place in milw would be paid for with my student loan. Pro:  Even if I do pay rent, I wouldn't have to fork out my entire loan just to pay rent upfront (bad credit...long story).  I could use the left over to pay bills.  That counts as 2 pros. Con: My brother. Pro:  He's not my CHILD!!! Con:  But he's my brother!!!  And what about my babies!!!  That counts as 2 cons!!! Pro:  When they come to visit they'd have Trast and Ayden (did I spell that right) to play with.  Con:...  Pro:  Plus, instead of being in plays in milw, around other students that I'd see everyday, I could (if allowed) audition in ww and not be as self concious.  I'd rather audition around strangers.   milw vs. ww: Pro:  Closer to school. Con: Entire loan check toward rent depending on whether or not I move with a roomie or with my brother or alone. Pro:  Save money in gas. Con:  My brother... Pro:  not my child. Con:  still my brother. Pro:  I think, not quite sure, but I think milw has a few more bars than ww.  Higher possibility of finding a great paying bartending job.  Counts as half a pro cause my odds of finding a job increases, but it doesn't necessarily mean I'll find a GREAT job. Con:...  ww 7 pros 5 cons  milw 4 pros 3 cons  we all know that staying in racine would be more like whitewater.  but, my brother would like to stay in racine, I don't really want to.  I think I just want to leave racine.  I think I was born to be a rolling stone.   this is the bottom line.  If I do decide to move to whitewater I would see what it's like commuting first semester and I'd have to find a job before I moved there.  same for milwaukee and same for racine.  most importantly, I'd have to see what my brother wants to do, because in this case, his well being is my first priority.  I want to make sure he is good before I decide to just move some place else without him.  as stupid as some may think that is, fuck you.  he's my brother and if I was only living for myself there would be no point of living.  either way, I'm moving.
