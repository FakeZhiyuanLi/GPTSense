       urlLink    Grass Moth  Tue, 29th Jun 2004 - Blackout  Finally, i experienced a blackout in my district after all my years of growing up in Singapore. And the funniest thing was that my younger brother thought it was his fault. Cuz at that exact point of time, he was trying to plug out the faulty mouse cable from my computer. Then the whole neighborhood around my area became pitched black. He came running into my room and panicking and saying "oh no ... oh no .... it's my fault!" . Haha ... what a coincidence!!!  Then i realised one thing there was nothing to do in complete pitch darkness. No fan ... no aircon ... no tv ... no hifi ... no lights ... no computer ... NOTHING! Even starhub mobile and singtel telephone lines network was down ... apparently too many people were calling and jamming the network. I was getting hot and frustrated. Really really going crazy! Especially with the kids in my neighborhood congregating to celebrate the blackout with fireworks and shouting.  I always worry for nothing! I got a bloody worrying mind. I kept worrying abt my love one. Till i just could'nt lay on my bed anymore. Moreover, it was getting so warm and humid. So i took a long walk to Serangoon central alone. Till my good friend, David called and decided to meet up with me. Had supper ... bak ku teh ... yummy!  Something struck me when i was walking towards Serangoon central. People would always move towards the light and stay there if they can afford it. Nobody really wants to stay in the dark. We are like the grass moth constantly being attracted by light sources. And trying to shun away from darkness. Only those who are lost will embrace darkness.  I would'nt want to in the dark. I want to see and be seen. I have eyes for sight, ears to hear and my heart to feel. I shall not be in the dark! Only when i'm down ... ...

      Who really is Raymond after all? Who am i to people? Who am i?  Countless times in life individuals come face to face with this question. This question bears much importance in relation to the people around us. I have been called many names in the past and present ... ...   Son. Child. Clown. Dog. Father. Brother. Sister? Disciple. Betrayer. Two-timer. Buddy. Best friend. Coward. Leo. Sergeant. Platoon Sergeant. Friend. Adviser. Councilor. Wet blanket. Loser. Fucker! Leader. Teacher. Weakling. Flinger. Playboy. InFiniTe. Jun Rong. Choon Yong. Darling. Sweetheart. Salesman. Dirt. Angel. Raymie. Ray. Asshole! Ah bao. Dear dear. Pig. Sleepy head. Bum. Dumb. Slow. Stupid. Last but not least ... Lover.   I know one thing. I am Raymond. Elder son of Michael and Shirley. But there are many names that people call me at times that ripped my heart open. Saddens me tremendously. There are other names that people call that make my heart glad. Life is never easy ... i can never please everyone nor am i a psychic that can read minds to give people what they want in life. I am only human.  Names given kindly or harshly by people close to my heart can change my life. I was once called a frog by a favourite auntie because i sounded like i croaked when i sang. From then on, I have always shunned away from using my vocals for singing. It changed my perspective of myself. I was once called "father" by a little boy that i helped tutored. He was like my son. I cared for him and loved him like my own. I felt his love for me as i became the father figure in his life. Haha ... i was once someone's "father".  I am currently a Lover to one special person in my heart. And there is no other place for another.   Words may seem casual. But it is a double-edged sword that can build or tear down lives. May my words in my blog and action in reality be judged by the people who care for me and read my posts.

       urlLink    Dancing Lights&nbsp; urlLink     Every able-bodied individual should have at least 5 sensory organs and probably a 6th sense for highly intuitive individuals. Every sensory organ that we have is unique. Its capabilities range from allowing us to touch, smell, taste, hear, sense ... ... but also to conjure images and dreams in our minds.  Last night, i had a dream. A really good feeling dream. It was probably due to my strong inner feelings in my heart. My subconscious probably merged the perfume that still lingered on my bed and the techno music that i was playing on my hifi set, and flooded my mind with memories of her dancing, smiling and laughing in her red t-shirt. It made my heart glad.  Kimmie spent so much time burning a cd for me last week. Yet i was not very appreciative on the surface. But deep down in my subconscious, whenever the music was played ... ... strong feelings and memories would come rushing back. I would remember her dancing.   The mind, heart and its sensory organs truly are wonders. The heart desires ... the mind strategizes how to achieve the desires of the heart ... organs go to work. Truly a work of God and not evolution.

       urlLink    9-11&nbsp; urlLink      How can we not remember the incident that brought America to its knees. I recalled being in camp that day, watching the second plane unleashing pain and terror onto the proud western nation. What truly happened? Who was to blame? Was it not enough for one tower to be brought down, but two?  Historians blame the bad blood between the Gentiles and Jews. People blame Osama bin Laden. Fingers pointed to religion. Politicians blame Bush and his right hand man.  Personally, i feel the finger-pointing should end. Follow the 90/10 rule. Kimmie kimmie sent me an interesting email regarding this sacred rule. Life is littered with 10% of situations that we have no control over. However, 90% of the time we can manage our feelings and turn the negative to a positve.  9-11 could have been avoided. Bush could have ordered their latest fighter planes to gun down the flying instruments of terror. However, "the fatal breakdown" was that there was a lack of communication between him and his right-hand man. Bush was unable to contact him. That breakdown caused much anguish and agony.  In this internet age, the flow of information is crucial for survival. May the twin towers event never happen again due to a communication breakdown. Such pains can be avoided. However, as true as it may be ... ... individuals refuse to break down their barriers to safeguard what is precious to their heart.  What is truly precious? ... ... ... i have found my Precious.

       urlLink    Rockin 1st mth with Linkin Park&nbsp; urlLink      In one hand, i have Purification. In the other, i have Paradise. Which one should i choose?   Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death (Purification), i shall fear no evil. For i have always believed that LOVE prevails. Only through purification, can i experience Paradise in its full glory.  Life is liken to a rollar-coaster ride. There are slight turns and sharp bends. No one achieves happiness and achievement without first experiencing pain and sacrifice. I hold on steadfast to Love as my guide to lead me on. I will never allow Love be wilted out of my life. This is my bond to you.  To those who can't wait to see me fail. I'll see you in hell!   The Wait Is Over - 22th Jun 2004   Many days have past with my poor Kimmie's heart yearning to be in the presence of Linkin Park's music. Many times have i offered to take her to the concert and allow her to soak up the raw hybrid rock music. But she refused, wanting me to save money for my future. I love her for that.  The day came ... it was our 1st mth anniversary ... i have decided to rebel against her wishes and purchase the tickets. That was where the magical moment arosed ... ... i have never seen anything in my life whereby my actions translated to true happiness!  I met up with Karen at her workplace. She looked bored and tired at first sight. Initially i told her that i would bring her for a picnic to celebrate our 1st mth. But then it looked cloudy, so i told her that i would bring her to see some married foreigners at padang. Immediately, her eyes lighted up ... her whole composure changed. She was happy and surprised. That was priceless!   A little painful sacrifice makes a long way ... ... Linkin Park truly ROCKS with Kimmie

It never fails to keep me in awe at the magnificient invention of photography, whenever i see this picture. In this picture, pure sweetness and happiness are captured in eternity. She's so beautiful and so sweet.  I have yet to find anyone to place my gratitude for this angel that has descended onto my life recently. Anyone wanna claim the reward???  Well well ... it all begun under the watchful eyes of Shrek ... Sleeping beauty ... Gingerbread man ... on the 22th May 04. An agreement was made ... then our hearts were crossed out for purification and paradise.

       The Birth Of An Individual:   Who am i? I have always pondered on this thought. Who am i really? What is my destiny? What do i really want to be?   These answers eluded me time and again. However, as the years pass by i begin to unfold the tapestry of my life bit by bit. I have currently only unfolded one quarter of it.  Long long time ago ... in the year 1979, a cute skinny baby boy was birth into the fine city of Singapore. This cute little skinny boy was known as Raymond aka InFiniTe.   Nannies:   I had very vague memories of my younger days. I could remember my younger brother and myself always having to stay with nannies, because both my parents were working full-time. Its quite an accommodating experience throughout those years. I had to be accustomed to the families and lifestyle of my nannies.   Most of them had customs and traditions that opposed that of my family. But hey ... Singapore is supposed to be multi-racial and harmonious. So i blended in. That probably explains why i am so versatile and adaptable in life.  I always remembered this sweet little nanny of mine who treated us with lots of ice-cream and movies and McDonalds. Oh my goodness!!! Thats what my parents would exclaim when they found out that i was fed with ice-cream. (It was believed that i had weak lungs due to extensive exposure to ice-cream by this fav nanny)   Rosyth Primary School   I grew up ... ... zipped past PSLE while studying in Rosyth Primary School. OMG ... whenever i mentioned my old old school, the rustic smell of tall leafy grasses would just hit me. It was such a small little field but it was filled with such great adventures. Stick insects, locusts, grasshoppers, snakes, spiders, 1.5m tall grasses ... ... what a tremendous playground! No modern HDB playground can come close to providing hours of thrills and danger.   My First Kiss   Hahaha one more memorable thing ... it was the year 1990 ... i had my first kiss ... on my HEAD! Hahaha ... furthermore it was on my gel-filled hair! There was this girl, Xinyi who plays the piano who was celebrating her bday on that fateful day. This girl has been openly declaring her lust for me since Primary 2! So on that fateful day, my helpful classmates wanted to fulfil her mad lust by getting her to kiss me! I was cornered at that time! No where to run! Then she came ... ... at the very last moment of her attempt ... i slo-mo matrix style and verved to one side. Hahaha and there i received my virgin kiss on my gel- filled hair.   Deyi Sec School   Many fateful memories and bonds were created here. My best friends in life were found here. Mr David Lau, the finest friend i could ever have. He is full of crap and nonsense. But whenever you need a listening ear or support, he will somehow be there. The other close friend is Mr Tan Ming Wei. Another entertainer that unwittingly provokes and humours me incessantly.   My First Girl   Her name was Yan Ting. She was the baddest, toughest, most rebellious and prettest girl in my express stream. I gave her my heart when i was in Sec 2. It was actually a competition amongst 3 girls. It was like a kiddy "Bachelor" game show. These girls took time to woo me in the day at school and at night hustler me with their voices over the phone. OMG ... at that time i thought i was so damn lucky!!!! What a threesome!!! Eventually i gave my heart to Yan Ting because she was the one whose character stood out from the crowd.  2 weeks after giving her my heart ... i decided it was time to give her a rose. Damn it was truly expensive at that time. I literally had to save for days just to get her a stalk. However, i was so shy that i did not even have guts to carry the flower around, let alone pass the flower to her. This is where buddies come in! Haha ... i made Mr David Lau bring the flower all the way home so that he could put it in a paper bag and pass it back to me. Then with the flower hidden in the paper bag, i gave away the flower.  Long story cut short ... i never held her hands ... kissed ... or make out with her. I was shy. Ok ... i was really shy at that time! Oh damn it!!!   Nanyang Polytechnic    Hooray ... i got into a biz poly course!!! I thought i was amongest the top students in my batch. Because biz course was so popular at that time! After years studying there, i realised that its such a general course. No specialisation. My boss always tells me, only with specialisation can we diversify to generalisation. My advice to students nowadays ... go SPECIALISE!!  It was the era in my life that i experienced freedom that i never had before. I had my first puff from my Leader, Koh Kok Chuan. Lost my virginity. Played basketball throughout the term. Fluked and repeated modules (1st time in my life ... that time). My first visit to a bungalow - Jeremiah's bungalow (separate guest house, mini lap pool, half basketball court, carpark for 10 cars, basement disco) in Bukit Timah.    Lyn Sia   Had a classmate, Lyn Sia came up to me 1 fateful day and asked ... "Can you see my nipples?" OMG ... i blushed so much ... actually she just wanted to ask me whether her nipples were showing up through her knitted blouse. Its no big deal to me now. But at that young age ... OMG ... i was so embarrassed. Furthermore she kept telling me that it was not her first time without bra. ArgH ... ...    Life goes on ... ... to b continued ... i'm currently 25 in 2004 ...

      Recently, i have received a number of gifts from my relatives, friends and sweet heart for my coming birthday. Its not even my birthday yet. But i have already been using them. Haha.  I have received an LG 7050 mobile phone, Issey Miyaki perfume, DKNY watch and some cash. Its always good to be on the receiving end of it. Its like Xmas for me. I've always loved Xmas since young because of the spirit of giving. Heh. Yeah i like to receive lotsa lotsa presents. But i only love giving them to the one that is closest to me. :P  I have always wanted a camera mobile phone. But did not really want to spend unneccesary money on one that does not really suit my budget and needs. My eye was always on LG 7100. Even though many of my friends named LG = "Lousy Goods/Grade". They claimed that LG sucks big time because its not durable. But hey, Nokia ,Sony Ericcson and Motorola suffers the same problems too. I go for budget mobile phones with functions that i require. After all i change handphones almost every year.   My LG 7050 has got real smooth interface. It does not jam or hang. It has a VGA camera with a standard resolution of 640 x 480, with a 4x zoom. And up to 9 multi-shots. Pretty cool. It comes along with free hands-free ear-piece, 2 batteries and most importantly a PC sync package. The only setback is that the ear-piece is quite troublesome to attach to the hp. But clarity is there and reception is very strong. Normally i cannnot receive any reception from the ground floor of my house, but surprisingly LG is able to pick up Starhub reception!  I have received many things recently. I have lost some things too. But i'm afraid that i am going to lose something precious to me soon.

       urlLink    Ryan  For two consecutive weeks, I have been going Liquid Room to celebrate my friends' birthdays. Its getting so boring and draggy there already. Please don't be mistaken. I still think that the place there ROCKS. But its getting overly crowded with rowdy western foreigners. One western foreigner is almost equivalent to two asians. When they dance and move about, it tends to get a little pushy and uncomfortable. Or probably I'm just tired of the clubbing scene. Everything looks so messy and chaotic. Many clubbers just like to let loose and be free to express their problems in the progressive house music there. I think I'm getting bored of clubbing. Always feel so tired after that. So I doubt I would celebrate my birthday there this week.   Had a great time catching up with my youngest aunt, Jocelyn on Saturday. My parents invited my relatives over to celebrate my younger brother's birthday as well as one of my aunt's birthday. I asked Aunt Jocelyn to bring her golden Labrador, Ryan. She was so nice as to rush home from Sentosa to bring her dog to my house via taxi. I missed Ryan. Even though he was only attached to my aunt and only listened to her commands. But I have always like dogs, especially dogs with strong character. Aunt Jocelyn has got three dogs; Ryan, Mel and Megan. All three dogs have exceptional different characters.   Ryan is the sensitive new-age guy type of dog. He looks good, strong and independent. But he is really a very sensitive, shy, attention-seeking and cowardly dog. But he protects my aunt so fiercely. Mel is the mature woman type of dog. She is the oldest dog amongest them. She is caring, sensible, very independent, takes control of situation and able to please people easily. Megan is special. I think she was born in April because she is so much like an Aries. Haha. Her ways are so unpredictable and so unique. She appears so strong and dominant but is always so vulnerable inwardly.   Ryan would be my favourite if I wanted to show-off a dog to someone. Because he is so handsome and silly. But Mel is my favourite, whenever I went to my aunt's house, Mel would just seat next to me and cuddle up. Allowing me to sayang her without much fear. Whereas Ryan and Megan would be chasing each other about in the house. Mel is like the balance between two chaotic forces. Whenever she steps in, Ryan and Megan would stop fooling around. She wields power and affection firmly. I'm always impressed whenever she does that.   Sunday i went shopping, walking, strolling and KTV with Kimmie. It was so fun just being together with her. I was so so so so happy. Until something dropped on the t-shirt Kimmie gave me as we were making our way back at Somerset MRT around 11 pm. Oh boy, i nearly wanted to pick up all the stones lying on the floor and shoot the bird that casually released its tension on me! Arghhhhh!!! Shit happens!   Recently, i have been reading a self-help book known as "The Road Less Traveled". Something really hit me when i was reading the first few chapters of the book. I thought it'll be great if i could share this with my friends. Every now and then, whenever i faced certain problems, i would just shove it aside and think that i'm not capable of fixing the problem. But i have learnt that if only i took time, a lot of problems could be solved. Some problems require lesser time, some much more time. But if only i took the TIME ... then the problems could be solved by me.  Now i sound like a neurotic ... hahaha .. HOLA HOLA!!!!

       urlLink    Bvlgari Diamond    Definitions of "Love" from   urlLink  www.dictionary.com    1) A deep, tender, ineffable feeling of affection and solicitude toward a person, such as that arising from kinship, recognition of attractive qualities, or a sense of underlying oneness.  2) A feeling of intense desire and attraction toward a person with whom one is disposed to make a pair; the emotion of sex and romance.  3) Sexual passion. Sexual intercourse. A love affair.  4) An intense emotional attachment, as for a pet or treasured object.  5) A person who is the object of deep or intense affection or attraction; beloved. Often used as a term of endearment.  6) An expression of one's affection: Send him my love.  7) A strong predilection or enthusiasm: a love of language. The object of such an enthusiasm: The outdoors is her greatest love.  8) Love Mythology. Eros or Cupid.  9) often Love Christianity. Charity.  10) Sports. A zero score in tennis.  So what is true love? Does it exist for relationships? Is it still possible for this era?  &nbsp;  True love to me is undying choice of affection and sacrifice for a love one. As long as couples can follow the wedding rites till the end of their time, then true love exists. The wedding rites; "Will&nbsp;you love her,&nbsp; comfort her, honour, and keep her, in sickness and in health; and forsaking all other, keep&nbsp;yourself only unto her, so long as you&nbsp;both shall live?" Is it difficult? It is up to the couple to decide.   I have a close friend of mine who is a young single mother. Nearly brought to tears when I talked to her about her kid's future. I felt moved that she was constantly worried about supporting her son since she was not earning much. I admired her resolve and resourcefulness in bringing up her son single-handledly.&nbsp;Love and sacrifice for her son.  &nbsp;  My dad&nbsp;has always believed in living a&nbsp;simple and healthy lifestyle. However, life has never been simple for my dad as he went in and out of hospitals throughout my 24 years of life. Operations after operations,&nbsp;i could never really remember how i felt when he was in there.&nbsp;Then on the first day of this year, my dad collapsed and went into a minor shock.&nbsp;I sent my dad&nbsp;to hospital in the ambulance. When&nbsp;i was filling up some paper work at the hospital, my mom came. Her eyes were filled with worry but not with tears. She prayed. Seeking for God's hand upon my dad. Then i saw streams of tears flowing. The tears were filled with love accumulated over the years for my dad. As the years went by and each time my dad is&nbsp;in the hospital, my mom&nbsp;reacted differently.&nbsp;Her bond with my dad grew stronger.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Love is never&nbsp;truly just&nbsp;feelings for a particular person.&nbsp;Many people take love as its&nbsp;only an affection,&nbsp;which would explain the increased numbers of divorce cases. But to me, Love is about making choices.&nbsp;Choosing to&nbsp;sacrifice.&nbsp;Loving someone is never easy. There are always heartaches. Without enduring such pains, Love cannot be revealed.   Does it exist?

       urlLink     Retro ME  &nbsp;  Hey check out the new pic that was taken by Kimmie! Heh i think that i look pretty&nbsp;suave in it. Hurhur.  &nbsp;  Had one hell of a long weekend. Cleared my IPPT on Thursday! Shopping with Kimmie on Friday. KTV, movie and clubbing with Kimmie on Saturday. So Sunday was a day of rest.  &nbsp;  Too bad the IPPT i took was at a SAFRA gym, otherwise I could have collected $200 incentive for getting silver. Initially I&nbsp;just wanted to try out and see if I would be able to pass. Never did I&nbsp;expect most of my static stations I was able to achieve silver and gold points. I failed so many of my previous attempts at IPPT when I was doing in-camp training. Probably that time I carried around too much fats. I was a heavy 76kg just before I ORD in Feb 2003. Now i'm only a feather-weight 62kg and standing at 178cm tall. How did I do it?  &nbsp;  Let me feed you some very unhealthy lifestyle that can reduce your weight fast. Skip lunch. Eat only bread for breakfast and lunch. Eat a full meal dinner. Then sleep real late. Drink very little water daily. Then go jog or do light-weights 3x a week. I guarantee that you would lose weight. Firstly, the lesser water you consume, the&nbsp;lesser body weight you would weigh. However, your body would feel very heaty. So, if you are not used to it. DO NOT TRY IT!!! Push your body to jog fast ... real fast ... till you feel as if your heart would jump out! This way you are causing the heart to perform at above 70% capacity. Very good for perspiring and purging all the soluble fatty substances.  &nbsp;  Worrying, sulking and being broke is a sure way to lose weight. Everytime i worry or am unhappy, i would feel hungry. Always searching for something to munch. So, as long as you are broke, then you can avoid buying tibbits or having late suppers outside. Depression is a known factor to cause a person to either lose or gain weight fast.  &nbsp;  I always believe that there are always two sides of a coin. Everything can become either good or bad. Take for instance, depression is a bad thing. But it has helped me lose weight. And together with my training, i was able to achieve silver for my IPPT. However, please do not follow my example if you are weak in heart.  &nbsp;  Its all about choosing your path and destiny. I have always learned from my mentors to take a stumbling block and turn it to a stepping stone. No matter how hard going life is, i would always remember that it is a marathon. Always walking, jogging, running or at times falling. Always reaching out for long-term goals and not for short-term goals.  &nbsp; I have failed so many times. Always disappointing my love one, family and friends. But still life goes on, to rebuild my dream.

       urlLink    Precious Moments  Recently, a gal friend called and poured out her troubles regarding her boyfriend who was "put away". I pondered on two things when she related her story to me. Friendship and love.  My friend was very upset because her boyfriend had to be put away just a day before their 3 years 4/5/6 months anniversary. She felt lost,confused and sad. So she called me. It was there and then that i assumed the position of a Listener. I used to always listen to my friends pouring out their soap opera stories to me. But it has been a long since i have done it. Probably because my heart was burdened too. I felt quite honoured that she chose me to talk to. It was as if i could be trusted and relied on.   As i listened, i realised that the life that she chose to take was self-sacrificing and probably foolish. But Love is foolish in some ways. She chose to wait for her boyfriend to come back to her. Is it worthwhile? Would she still want to spend a lifetime with him? Only she knows the answer. I am just a listening ear. The decision lies with her.  Time spent with our love ones are precious. Even though at times, there are unhappy moments. But every moment is precious. Its alright to fight and argue as long as its for the best interest of the relationship. I realise that we have to take life's challenges as it comes. I always believe that nothing long-lasting and good would come by without struggles. Always treasure moments. Always take pictures because each picture taken is frozen in time. If one day, our love one is not by our side ... it'll be too late to regret.

       urlLink    Ms Act Cute Meanie  Yesterday i brought my darling for a movie that i thought was bitchy and silly. But "Mean Girls" absolutely rocked! It has been such a long time since i laughed so much and thought funny things. Damn ... its funny that i would want to watch a show about silly, bitchy, plastic girls fighting over a guy. But hey, this show is not a no-brainer show ... its sensitive and seriously funny too. It was the right mixture to make serious people like me crack up and laugh!  I truly had a great time with Kimmie last night. We spotted about 3 odd couples watching the same show as us. After the movie, we spotted another two more odd couples. Heh. I was like thinking ... they are odd because of great difference in appearance ... one couple was of different colour ... another couple the ang mo guy was short but gf was a little taller ... then a weird girl couple ... yet some of them looked lovingly together. Truly love knows no boundaries.   I would always steal glances at Kimmie ... secretly admiring her whenever she smiles and laughs and when she looks bewildered. Hahaha. Yeah it was a great night out for me. After i sent her home, i was seriously starving. I was so hoping that the fried chicken stall was still opened. But too bad, so i ended up buying kimchi instant noodles.   I have been feeling very hungry these few days. Probably because i have been jogging. I need to clear my IPPT before first week of August! I feel that jogging helps me stay clear-headed and positive. The Endorphins produced makes people feel good.  Endure ... jog ... endure ... jog ... but if you need instant feel good, just watch "Mean Girls" or SEX!

       urlLink    Marriage is a crazy thing  Last night, i was so damn bored because i could not use the pc and i was home. So i decided to watch the korean movie "Marriage is a crazy thing" on the telly. Wow! Although there were no nude scenes, but the story plot captivated me from the start till the end. Colours were captured in a simple but delightful mood. Great for entertaining me. I love to see a beautiful mirage of colours presented to me in life. It makes life kinder.  After the movie, i pondered over it for quite some time. Certain parts of the movie seemed to identify with my life currently. But what really struck me was that Love is not simple. Life is never simple anyway. And what really irks me was that how could someone want to love two different persons for a long period of time.   The basic story plot of this movie revolves around a guy and a girl. They met on a blind date and had great sex. They want to get married but did not because they had different needs that they did not want to iron out. The girl got married to a doctor but would always go back to the other guy on weekends to have great sex and companionship. In the end, the guy was sad because the girl could never be with him all the time. So they broke up. It was a story of a effortless relationship that had no results. No pain, no gain!  When i was young, I constantly had this nightmare whereby I was in the centre of a battlefield. Warriors on horses and soldiers on foot on both sides would come charging to the centre of the battle field to confront each other. I could always remembered the tremors on the ground and the deafening screams and noises they make. I always wake up shakened and perspiring. Yes, to me a new relationship is like that.  In every relationship, there are always flaws. I always view new relationships as if its 2 forces fighting on a battlefield.  Two forces clash and trash it out. Then as time goes by, the two forces becoming more wary of war so they sit and talk about improving their relations. But every now and then, there are always secret wars waged among both of them. All this are done so that finally a beneficial relationship of trust would be forged. Then as time goes by, most of the flaws would be ironed out. Fight ... fight ... fight!!! Love ... love ... love!!!  Then i wondered why would anyone want to take so much effort and time to do all these things just to get married. I believe that such effort is well-spent to put a relationship through fire so that the couple could have a chance to live together meeting each others needs.

       urlLink    My Aries Babe   Aries in Love   Aries is the cardinal-fire sign which translates into life loving and highly energized and this describes their needs concerning love as well. As a partner they make life exciting, albeit occasionally tiring, and you cannot help but feel rather joyful and light hearted when you're in their company. It's that blend of innocence (the lamb) with pure power (the ram) that is so captivating about an Aries mate.   They don't understand the meaning of the word routine, however, and boredom is the number one killer of Aries romances. Aries loves as boldly and as strongly as it experiences life. From sports to personal challenges Aries are usually not happy unless they are moving after something.   With Mars as their ruling planet oftentimes their entire lives are about channeling and putting that immense power to work for them. It's not uncommon to find an Aries firmly committed to a long term volatile arrangement that leaves those around them wondering why they would stay. The truth is they often thrive on that kind of intensity and it can do far less damage than existing within a relationship that has grown routine and stagnant. When an Aries loves they LOVE.  The partner is hoisted up onto a pedestal whether they want to be there or not and they become a treasure to be protected and guarded passionately. The love of an Aries life often becomes the driving motivation for their challenging goals and the phrase, "I did this for YOU" is one heard in many of the best Aries relationships.     Aries Sexuality   An Aries sexuality is driven, powerful and almost a feat of showmanship when they are truly captivated. Since Aries tend to be action/goal oriented sex can become a series of higher plateaus involving anything their fertile imaginations can conjure up. Aries are the zodiac show-off and the bedroom isn't excluded from their dramatic and captivating ability to get partners undivided attention. The more appreciated they feel the more they invest in their lovemaking and private boundaries exist only to give an Aries something to leap over. Marathons of passion, spontaneous liaisons in the most unexpected places and inexhaustible stamina are all part of the Aries basic sexual make-up.     The Long Term Story   Lots of pampering and a lot of attention are needed with an Aries lover as they thrive on feeling they are number one in your life. They love to do the initial chasing and are usually not attracted to being chased but once their heart is given you can't ever over-do your displays of affection. While they can be jealous and possessive you cannot show the same qualities and any kind of clinging is a sure fire way to drive them into new pastures. Under all the Aries bravado and show is actually a rather innocent child who simply wants to explore the wonderful world around them and to be appreciated. The more encouraged they are in either area the more exuberant they become.     Positive Traits in Love   Exuberance, expressiveness, passion, generosity, adoration, protectiveness, adventuress, fun loving, creative and energized lovemaking, and devotion.      Negative Traits   Temperamental, jealous, possessive, ego oriented, inconsiderate, reckless, fickle      What an Aries Likes   Being number one, A positive attitude, A life loving comrade, A. partner who has style or a 'look', Being Seen Getting gifts, Loyalty, Being active together. Romance and dazzle.      What an Aries Dislikes   Being bored, Being chased, Sloppiness in a mate, Criticism, Anything mundane, Feeling unappreciated, Feeling inferior, Losing, Having to repeat things. Displays of insecurity.      Aries Love Keywords   Dramatic, romantic, original, passionate, energized, creative, spontaneous      May the protective, adoring, playful, inventive, generous, supportive, sensual, warm, joyful Raymie Leo take care of his little Aries

      The past few days i have been walking and walking long distances. There were many things out there to see as i travelled from point A and B. But it can be agonisingly lonely walking alone especially when my heart is burdened. Sadness dwells in my mind and heart. Therefore, i carried on walking and walking. Each time i began walking, i push myself to walk further. I wanted to numb myself. But i could not bear releasing the memories. That unforgetable smile in my mind. That smell that carried on lingering in my head. That laughter and the voice that still echos in my ears. I just feel so sad.   Walked past a pet shop today and saw a cute little doggie by the window. Took 2 pics of the puppy. Its so useful having a camera hp. Is it cute?   urlLink    Cute Doggie   urlLink    Come on ... face me

      只剩下钢琴陪我谈了一天  睡着的大提琴 安静的旧旧的  我想你已表现的非常明白  我懂我也知道 你没有舍不得  你说你也会难过我不相信  牵着你陪着我 也只是曾经  希望他是真的比我还要爱你  我才会逼自己离开  你要我说多难堪 我根本不想分开  为什么还要我用微笑来带过  我没有这种天份 包容你也接受他  不用担心的太多 我会一直好好过  你已经远远离开 我也会慢慢走开  为什么我连分开都迁就着你  我真的没有天份 安静的没这么快  我会学着放弃你 是因为我太爱你

      I had a wonderful birthday this year. It was not extravagant nor was it fantastic. It was a very simple celebration with my sweet heart. It was Kimmie who made me really happy. Initially, i was feeling a little down and tired cause i have not been sleeping well the past few days ... hurhur i suspect it could be some withdrawal symptons. Ha! Or probably i kept eating suppers that made my tummy feel uncomfortable.  I did not really plan anything at all to celebrate my birthday. I just did not know what i really wanted to do. Cracked my head a little. But decided to just go with the flow. After all its my birthday, i get to choose what i like to do. And i just wanted to spend time with Kimmie.  When i saw Kimmie approaching me from her office with a small paper bag, immediately i knew! Haha ... my darling bought me more presents. She had already bought me so many presents prior to my birthday, yet she still went to buy me really 2 nice tops for me. OMG! So many presents!!! Hahaha ... its feeling like Xmas now. She's pampering me ... haha ...  We went for a simple dinner at Pizza Hut. Had my first Seafood Supreme pizza in my entire life. OMG! All i can say is, go for real seafood! I had chili satay sauce crabs on monday evening. Damn shiok! 3 small crabs for only $18 at Kuali restaurant near my house. Delicious! Yummy.  After Pizza Hut, i still had no idea how to celebrate my birthday. Then Kimmie suggested KTV. Hehe. Suddenly i liked the idea! I've been a little caught up with the KTV craze. I did not really like to sing last time. But after singing with Kimmie, i begun to appreciate my own off-key low pitch voice. She has been very encouraging too. Learning to tackle new songs also gave me a chance to refresh my chinese. Yeah, so off we went to K-Box, my first time there too.    At first, it was hard getting used to the sound system there. We prefer the Party World KTV rooms and sound system. But after a few adjustments, i was able to sing better than previous ktv sessions. Haha ... its either my voice was modified by the mike or maybe it was the Seafood Supreme. Hurhur. Enjoyed singing some of the songs, especially Beyond - Love! Damn i love that song.   My poor Kimmie has been down with flu recently. Despite her not feeling well, she still sang duets with me in K-Box. Even though she could not really hear well and sing due to flu and sore throat. And too bad we discovered F.I.R. songs too late, only managed to sing only 1 song, 我们的爱. Tired as she was, she was always smiling at me, trying to make me feel happy. Her smile was tremendously lovely yesterday.    Happy birthday to me! Happy happy birthday to me!!! Out of the many presents i have received, i am truly happy that Kimmie shared my birthday with me! And i want to thank all my good friends and family for wishing me a very happy birthday.   Gracias mucho mis amigos y kimmie!
