       What a crappy day.       Well. in terms of weather. The rain could not get any thicker, and the mud could not get any muddier.        Or not.        Well I would not call it a horrible day. The day wasn't without its high lights. School  was  bearable. Crazy Eights every recess and lunch gets more exciting with every game. But on the flipside, the teacher was not.       My Careers teacher is  so  annoying.       She's a great teacher, I mean sometimes she can be very interesting, but most of the time, she fails to make me ask for an encore. She's not only a depressing teacher (who excites her students, then tell them they are only taking notes), but she is also a very uptight teacher. But hey, that's all I'm going to say about her personally. It's my last day of school tomorrow =D.       The last day of school, however mgith end up being the worst of all days. I, along with the other 18 students, will be interviewed by her. By her.  By her.  And then the possible 4 hour exam review starts. I, along with her other 18 students, will have to be subjected to her droning.       Bring on the rain.

       It's been quite a while since I've updated. It might be because I am lazy, or busy. Either way, I'm exhausted from the summer overkill, but I still don't want the summer to end...       What do I mean by summer overkill?  Stuck with my mother and sister for too long. Having to do math work (fellow Asians can relate). Being at the computer too much (although some would dispute this claim as a blessing). The point is, I've had enough of this. My mom, from her annoying socialite Chinese friends also known as  see-lai  in Cantonese, has been convinced that I have been playing too many computer games, and therefore would lose my drive to work, leading to bad grades, leading to not getting into university and then disgracing our family.      Peachy.      The summer wasn't without it's highlights. I've been so blessed to have such good friends that would take my mind off the horrible times I would have at home. I mean I love my family, but sometimes it gets dysfunctional - and I need to get away from it.      Soul-Searching has been a high priority for me this summer - with the help of Iris. Just this past Monday we hung out at P-Mall, then we sat down at a nice little bubble tea place and started talking about our year in high school. It made me think of what a wasted year it was. I did nothing to further my long-term career goals, or gain enough work experience for a much-needed job. Yaaaaa, and the bi issue. I'm still not to comfortable with it.      I think a part of me wants to be free, but the other part is connected to my family.  Gosh,  it's just that they are the only people that influence what I am and what I should be. If they weren't here to tell me what I should be, what I should do, who I should see and where I should go, I think I would be a much more happier person right now. I would be at ease with myself...I would be more  me .       One of the reasons why, I guess, I just don't listen to my parents is that I do believe that everything happens for a reason. I believe that everything that happens, whether good or bad, will turn out good for all of humanity -or just for you, in the end. Maybe if I didn't have my mom or sister to hold me down and deflate my "ego" on a daily basis, I could've been a conceited, self-centered piece of crummy shit. But still, a part of me still hungers for what I can be w/o my parents.      Only time will tell.
