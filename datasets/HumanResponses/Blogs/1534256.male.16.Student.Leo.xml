      It's Wednesday. I have a headache. I have a piano lesson at 3. Am I going to go in for it? Doubtful.  Two exams yesterday: Music and German Listening. I made a few obvious mistakes, stupidly, but as a whole I think I did okay. Bring on the English Lit. is what I definitely do not say. So at the moment, I'm feeling relatively mellow and I have my DVDs to comfort me for the rest of the day. Oh, and Rise of the Middle Kingdom, of course, with its cool chineseness.  Anyroad, have a lovely day, peoples, Scott.

       Tuesday : Had a german oral. It went really well, actually. I got asked questions on communism and whether it works in practice... You can't tell me sensible people get asked that kind of thing in GCSE orals.   Wednesday : Went into school with Adam and generally pissed about in the lovely whether *sighs*... OK, enough of that. I then got home and, after being informed that Jon would be coming 'round within the next hour, decided it would be best to walk to Buzzy's house... clever me. But I gave myself a good half hour to get back... and walked to my nan's. Jon was late though, so hooray for sa mère! Showstoppers then confused me greatly, 'cause I kinda fell for Mel again, and she kinda knows again... but it's not like last year, where she ignored me for two months, so that's all right. I'm glad that hasn't happened again... But anyway, Showstoppers was cool, 'cause Jon, Toby, Mel and I are in the "elite" Showstoppers *wink wink*, which means we get to take centre-stage, basically. So weee for us and our brilliance. Really, you have to hear Mel sing Tonight. Raises the bloody roof.   Thursday : Woke up, walked to Joe's and got a lift to Aroma. Had many Chinese foods, got very ill, and then went to School with Buzz and Marcus. Hung around School for a bit, then walked into town and bussed home. Quite an OK day, but the weather got worse, so boo hoo:(.   Now : Uh, blogging... Good night, pleasant dreams, Scott.

      NO MORE SKOOL, NO MORE SKOOL, NO MORE SKOOL, NO MORE SKOOL, NO MORE SKOOL!   Umm... excuse me... but isn't it supposed to be spelt S-C-H-O-O-L?   Yep, and there's no more of it. WEEEEEEEEEE!  Until tomorrow, when I have a German Oral. Karl Marx würde in 1818 in Berlin geboren... I'm not stopping for brevity, I'm stopping because that's how much of my presentation I know. Bugger. Néanmoins, I'm feeling pretty good at the moment, as you can imagine. And then on Wednesday, when I've agreed to keep Adam company before his Drum lesson. But then comes Thurday, filled with its Chinese Aromary goodness, huzaaaah!  Saviour of the Universe!  Ohohoho, wonderful...  Not forgetting, of course, that I'll be going back to STRS in September, because it's the best school in the world. No debate.  Anyway, all you peoples who have to go to school until July, ahahahahahahahahah adinfinitum , Scott.

      It's Sunday and I haven't showered or shaved yet. Brilliant. I also haven't got the paper yet. Brilliant. I now have no plans for the day but doing my homework and watching seven episodes of Friends. Brilliant.  Ohoho, the weather's lovely, so I might as well get a book and read outside for a while. Now... which of the thirty-odd books on my to-read pile shall I pick?  The Dow's back above 10,000 points, aw, and Nikkei's still just below its 11,000 benchmark. Still, musn't grumble, eh?  I'm shit, ahh, Scott.

      Because, to be honest, who wouldn't with designs like these *makes wrowling motion*. What am I in need of saying, then? I've just restarted this old thing (which had previously died o' leprosy), so I'd better find something to say...  Ok, then. I was supposed to be going al cinema tomorrow, avec Mel, aber now she cannae make it, Cap'n, which is shit. Shit shit shit, with a capital fuck. But still, can't be helped. Instead, come round, all ye copains à moi, and we can play D&D all through the day, weeeeeeeee. Or not, maybe. Up to you. I could do with getting some revision done, as I have a German Oral on Tuesday and I have done fick alle revision. Ah well, I'll get by, I always have before (not being smug, quoting Evita).  Ach, well. Il n'y a rien à dire, vraiment. I'll be blogging more frequently now, my lovelies, Scott.
