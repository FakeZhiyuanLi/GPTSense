      Finally decided to write a blog. And most likely this might be the only one post I would end up writing. I have always thought that putting your thoughts into words helps streamline you thoughts. There are lots of people whose minds are filled with lots of thoughts. It is highly important that those people streamline their thoughts through some method like meditation, writings, etc. These people are generallys absentminded, opinionated, etc. If you mind is able to stick to one particular thought for longer period of time thats what people call as concentration. It all depends on how you can keep your mind empty. I have also heard the fishing helps keep you mind calm ;-)  I think this is more than enough for a first blog. If I were to continue writing this blog, may I want to talk about some of the things like "the system", information growth and the infinite knowledge to deal with, capitalism and its so called success, manufacturing consent by Chomsky and generally thoughts and life as such.   Have a good one.

      Of the various ancient civilizations that were commonly acknowledged as ancient, the only one that remains seem to be the greek. Most of the western thought seems have come from the greek ideologies. What happeneded to the rest? Is it safe to say that they are not even present in their own country of origin? I guess thats true in the case of the Indian Phililosophy. One of the cornerstone of indian philosophy is mind control and the belief on "happiness is within" (whatever that means). Has this philosophy withstood its ground ?  There has been a recent discussion in my college mailing list about the comments made by some infosys guy that innovation can only be done in US and indian software companies should help them in that process. This somehow led to a discussion on "Are indians really dumb?". Why should a country and its people be judged by its scientific execellence? Is that all to life? Should that be a commonality among all the people and culture? Was indian culture based around it? I dont think so.  I have never thought scientific excellence was what indian culture was based upon. Indian culture did not follow the path of rationality which the greeks followed (later  became the basis of western thought and scientific pursuit). Indian philosophy, I think, involved the "unknown" and "unknownable". There are things in the world which cant be explained or understood by human beings (which is till true). So the easy way to deal with the "unknownable" is the presence of the "unknown" (belief system of gods). "Ignorance is bliss" most aptly describes indian philosphy.  So where did the indian philosphy fail? One of the main falures of indian culture could be its inablity to protect itself from western thoughts. This doesnt mean that western thought is not good. But indian culture failed to impress upon its own people the potential it offered for leading their life. The Indian socienty seemed to be impressed by the western thought and it definition of happiness. The westerners judged the Indian society, culture, development,etc based on their system. So as a new comer to the western thought, nations like india is considered under-developed.   So indian people are working hard to improve there lives as measured by the western belief system. This spread of western philosophy ( or thought or watever) to other once culturally different nations is being pronounced as upliftment of third-world countries. This new colonization is spreading quite fast.   Construct your thought around "Meaning of colonization", Software Industry, Outsourcing and "The Resource" to observe one of the manifestation of neo-colonialism.

      I have often wondered about what the terms being well, wealthy, poor, etc means about a persons life. What do you say as the poor or good living conditions? Is there a objective measurement of this state of well-being? I keep wondering what people mean when they are trying helping other people improve their life through social and charity work? I always thought that such people are imposing their idea of well being on other people. It is more like telling all those people, whom they are trying to help, that their life is not good and needs improvement. Can person's life be judged as good.  How can you compare the lives of a software engineer in valley to that of the touareg of the saharan desert? One can never say one being well compared to others. Well being is mostly defined by the instantaneous gratification that can be obtained by each person. (Am I wrong, any opinions?). Can we compare the ability to spend a week in cayman islands to the of making a meal in the saharan desert? Well being cant be coerced into any definition.  One of the main things to have happened with this age of increased communications between people from different parts of world is the imposition of ideas. This is more like the "thought control" being referred to by Chomsky (wll talk about this later).  The state of well being as propagated by the powerful people of the world is being absorbed very well by vast majority of people. And it is influencing other people through "society" aspect of a person. The system is being defined with process by which you can also be part of it.  BTW, folks watch the movie "children of heaven", excellent movie about lives of two kids, where everything they look forward to is a pair of new shoes :)  Have a Nice One.

      The progression of human system of thoughts from mythology, philosophy to science & technology is very interesting. I have always found it hard to distinguish each of theese terms from its predessecor or its the successor.  Mythology means story telling or relating to myths of people and tradition. Most of stories deal with gods like Ramayana, Iliad,etc. These stories also came up various assumptions or conclusions on various natural phenomenon, god, heaven, etc. Then came the so called philosophers from ancient greek and questioned everything which was part of the myths.  What the philosophers were seeking were a "rational reasoning" of what that myth-tellers were assuming. Philosophy refers to "love of wisdom", it mostly deals with the rational understanding of abstract concepts like ethics,truth, goodness,etc. There were some philosophers who tried to explain natural phenomenon. It is mostly the greek philosophy which deals with the "art of reasoning". The vendanta (or the culmination of vedas) does not have an dialectic approach. It does not give answers so you cant question them. The fundemental aspect of the vedantas indicates "walking the path is different from knowing the path", from  matrix.     Science came up with "system of knowledge" through which most of the natural phenomenon can be explained. The system explains and also predicts various natural phenomenons. There are still various areas in which science is not able to explain what we oberseve. The fundementals of science are mostly from the rational, dialectical philosophers of the west. Sceintists like galileo, einstein, bohr,etc are as equal philosophers as they being scientists. The "relativity" theory which was given a recent explanation by einstein has been a very interesting theory for the myth tellers and the philosophers. However galileo was among the first people to talk about relativity when he endorsed the copernican theory of the universe.  Technology is mostly based on the applied areas of fundemental sciences. Technology is nowadays the the specialized area of science. Each person has a specialized area of specialization. Science was for much wide-spread audience but technology is for a relatively few people to understand. This has been one of the side effects of the enormuos growth of the of knowledge.  Mythology, philosophy, science &amp; technology are all "belief systems" which started out to explain people on "what is life? understanding its purpose?". By the time it reacched the "science &amp; technology" phase an entirely new materialistic system was built and most of the people forget about the fundemental questions. The new meterialistic system is growing very fast and it has been said that "knowledge" is growing. But for all we know knowledge is infinite and fact is a myth.
