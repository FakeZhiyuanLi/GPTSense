      Dance was quite the adventure. Both of the dances went like shit. Oh my freakin' god, I've never danced so badly in my whole life. It was sad and a half. So terrible. I wanted to cry while I was up there. Bah.

      I've been having an awesome week. It's just been ... wow.  First, the ball with Mark started to roll, then he asked me to grad, then it was time for Base Camp and just today I read my acceptance letter for ODS. It's been a great week, I must say.   I'm really excited for Outdoor School. Apparently there's a 2km run involved and I'll bet you any money that I'm going to die, but that's ok. I need a change, I need to get away. I feel kind of bad for leaving Mark there alone for half the year, but I'm not going to not go because of him. I mean, I like him and everything, but I don't want to regret that I didn't go because of a guy.   I hate how much I like him. But it's kind of nice knowing that there's someone out there who likes you for you. Ashlee was right, I've gotten a lot of bad apples, but Mark is definitely worth the wait. He's funny, sweet, nice and he doesn't pressure me to do what I don't want to do. What more could I ask for in a guy? Sure, he's 6'6", but you can't have everything right? Heh. In any event, he's awesome and I'm sure that he'll be all I'm going to be writing about in here for the next little while. I hope everything stays good and nothing goes bad. I suppose I shouldn't worry about the outcome and just enjoy what I have now, but I can't help it. I'm going to take Ashlee's and Sara's advice and just let him in. I don't want to get hurt, but I can't go through life with my guard up constantly. I won't push him away, but I won't let him take over either. My morals and inhibitions won't walk out the door when he walks in because I'm stronger and smarter than that. Sigh. He makes me smile.

      I was out shopping for dance pants, which I didn't find by the way, and then I went shopping for my little cousin's birthday party. When I got home, I gave Mark a call and he came and picked me up and we went back to his house to watch Shrek. It was fuuun. We were all alone watching a movie for like 2 hours and he didn't pull anything. He's too good to be true. I mean, there were a couple kisses, but it's not like he was trying to shove his tongue down my throat. He's such a sweetie, how did I get so lucky? I don't know either, but whatever happened, it sure makes me happy. Oh geez, he's so awesome.

      Wow ... Mark is more than awesome. He's just ineffably awesome. We were together tonight. Alone for a while and we just sat in his car and held hands. He didn't try and pull anything. We just sat there talking and cuddling. It was AWESOME. Sigh. I think its all too good to be true, but I hope it's not. I'm so happy, I found a winner.  And, assuming Aunty Su lets me, I'm going to grad with him!!!!!!! WATCH OUT GRAD 2004, HERE COMES CYNDI!!!!!!!!!!

      I met Mark on Friday. Now it's Monday. And for some strange and unknown reason, he's always on my mind. I don't even know the kid. I can't possibly like him. I know why he's always on my mind: I keep thinking about him and the more I think about him, the more I romantacize who he is. I don't even know who he is! I'm making everything up and I'm falling for this awesome personality that I'm associating with Mark. Pathetic, yah? I think I'm also pretty desperate. I'm lonely and I need somebody, so I fall for the next possible guy. I kind of have little things for people when I first meet them because I see them as potential boyfriends. How pathetic is that? Quite. Ho hum. Hopefully Prince Charming will come and sweep me off my feet soon. I'm getting tired of waiting and my feet hurt.   And Dez. Oh Dez, what do I do about you? You're my new Wayne. I love you and I've only ever felt like this about somebody else and that was Wayne. It looks like our relationship is taking the same turn too. I liked Wayne SO MUCH and we talked a lot, but then he started dating Lindsay. I love you, in spite of all your imperfections, but now you'll probably end up dating Richelle. Why does this always happen? I know the answer. I always wear my heart on my sleeve and it's beyond me why I do it. Every time I get hurt. I get pushed to the ground, but for some reason I always get back up again. Maybe I'm stupid but then again maybe I just have faith in people and truly believe that someday, the right thing will happen. I hope that day comes soon, because I'm so tired of getting hurt.  So, to sum everything up: I'm in love with Dez. I'm in lust with the Mark I'm making up in my head. I think I'm crazy.

      I think today is our one month. I'm not positive. But I'm thinking it is. Hehe, I'm so bad. I don't even know when our one month is. But it's not like he asked me out. Things just kinda happened, so there was no set date. I'm still a good girl! =P

      Down another 5. Should feel bad, but I don't. Should stop, but I probably won't. Have a problem and know it yet I don't want to fix it. There's another problem. I'm just full of those babies right there. Anyhow ... don't ask. Just read. Thanks.

      Mark is leaving for a month to work in Manitoba, 7 hours away. This wouldn't be so bad because we'd still have a month of summer together, but the thing is I'm leaving for 2 weeks in a week and some days. Then when I get back, I might go to Notre Dame, a stay-over basketball camp, for a week. And then Mark leaves. Is it bad for me to not want him to leave? I'm going to miss him so much. Is that bad? I don't even know.

      What a night I did have, what a night indeed. Relationships torn apart, persons leaving other persons, drama with no end ... and they try to blame it on me. Well you know what? Fuck off. I know you'll never read this, but that's ok. I'm writing in here for me and not for you. You should realize what a horrible person you are. You treat your wife like shit, you're not there for your kids when they need you. What makes you think you're an adequate father at all? If you're not ready for marriage, then you shouldn't have gotten married. And if you're not ready for a family then my god, you shouldn't have made two kids!!! I love the girls and wouldn't trade them for anything in the world, but if you're going to be an asshole and run around like a chicken with its head cut off, then I'm thinking there's something wrong with this situation. I know you didn't get to live the single life and go bar hopping and have your share of one night stands but if that's the life you really want to lead then why would you enter this world instead? YOU'RE JUST FUCKING UP EVERYTHING YOU AND MY AUNTY HAVE BUILT ASSHOLE!!!   Now I'm afraid to go home and sleep because I don't want to get knifed while I'm asleep. So for now, I'm staying at my cousin's house. I know this blog has been veeeery vague, but if you want more, you can ask. If not, have a good day folks! And Outdoor School fitness test, here I come!

      Please talk to me. Please tell me what's on your mind because I can't read it. You say not to worry, but how can I not worry when you walk out of my house at 5 in the morning with nothing to say? Tell me why you're upset with me and I'll try my best to fix it. You mean so much to me and I can't stand this deafening silence. Please?

      I feel like I'm going into one of my depressive states again. I get these quite often. One day I'll be higher than high and the next I'll be lower than low. I don't know what triggers this dramatic change, but it sucks. I get like this whenever I PMS, and I know that's what's happening this time. But other times, it's just too much and I don't know what to do. So I do what makes me feel better. I know what I do is wrong, but I don't know any other way. I hate how this feeling can come into my life and completely take over, causing me to do things I wouldn't normally do.   I'm so confused and lost in this endless cycle. Endless cycle; there's a redundant statement. Anyway, I don't know what to do here. I need help, but who can help me? Nobody knows what I'm going through. The best they can do is listen. And then there's Mark. What do I do about him? I'm so happy when we're together and I'm so completely in lust with this guy and he shouldn't have to put up with me and my lack of emotional stability. I don't want to lose him, I don't want to let him go but I don't want to keep him either. Not if what I can't deal with is going to ruin our relationship. Please help me ... somebody!

      Why am I like this? How can I go from an extreme high to an extreme low in a matter of hours? Why can't I just be happy with everything around me? Why am I so goddamn insecure and bitchy? I know part of this is PMS, but the other part is just me. I'm so ... GAH. I wanna cry.

      I've lost 5 pounds in I don't know how long. I don't know how either. Actually, I do. I know that I have a problem. One of many. It's not like other people who replace a certain pain with another pain (the pain of hunger). No. I do that with other things. This is me not replacing anything, just taking away. Taking away food because when I look in the mirror, I see a gross figure. Then when I haven't eaten and I see my hip bones and that my waist is smaller, I'm happy. I'm disgusting but I can't stop. It's not that I don't eat, because I do. I just ... eat less and less often. That's not so bad right? Sigh. Why am I like this? Why can't I see me the way other people see me?

      Just a few things I've realized over this past school year.  - Friends come and go - Don't rush into anything you're not ready for - People change and move on, sometimes leaving you in the dust - There is always a silver lining behind every cloud - When you've hit rock bottom, there's no where to go but up - No matter how bad things seem, there is always somebody there who loves you - Enjoy what you have while you have it because before you know it, it'll be gone - The greatest things can be found in the most unexpected places - I have an awesome boyfriend - Don't let anyone tell you who or what to be - Even when it seems like it, it's not the end  These are the ones that come to mind as I skim through the year in my head. So much has happened and so many changes have occured but I still came out in one piece. The year started out pretty shitty but it's ending alright. And not just because of Mark. Things with Sara are falling back into place and my relationship with Jasmin is continuing to grow. I've grown apart from a lot of people in the past few months, but maybe I didn't fit in with them as much as I thought I did. Honestly, I don't know who I am. I'm still trying to figure that out, but isn't that half the fun in life? Finding who you are and where you're meant to be? I'll never forget the people who have made my year worthwhile and brought me up when I was down. Sam, Emily, Cristina, Keri, Nicole, Sara, Lindsay, Jasmin, Mark, Ricky and so many more. They mean so much to me but I don't think they'll ever realize it.   To my Sammy ... I love you to bits and to pieces. I'll never forget this year. From the good ol' days of morning ball to the crying and meaningful talks. We've grown apart like nobody's business, but I know that the friendship we've built is stronger than that. For only knowing each other for a year, you've made such a difference in my life and helped me to see who I can be and what I can do. You're a wonderful person, so full of love and energy. All I have to say is, I love you and go get 'em, Tiger! You're gonna do great.  To my Emily ... It's been a great 2 years with you. It all started that one day in the auditorium when I helped you paint those kick ass hills. Who knew that it would turn into one of the greatest friendships of my life? You're so wise and philosophical, always willing to help and one damn smart cookie! I know we haven't talked in a long time and I regret it so much. I hated seeing you leave on Friday without a goodbye. I'm going to miss you so much. Even through our ups and downs you've never failed to addist me when I needed assistance and you've never turned your back on me when I needed you most. I say, watch out Europe 'cause here comes Emily!  To my Sara ... Wow. We have been through so much shit this year. More than most people go through all through out high school, I'd say. Our fights were petty but we still made it through. Nobody is there for me like you are. Nobody listens like you do and nobody can bring a smile to my face the way that you can. You're one in a million and I think that the fact that we're still friends after everything proves that. Maybe our fights were a test of true friendship, or maybe they were just us being dumb. Whichever it was, I think we overcame them pretty damn well. I love you.  To my Jasmin ... I don't know where we stand with each other right now but then again, I don't think a good friendship needs to be defined and labeled. We've been to hell and back this year; part of it was together and part of it was apart. The apart time was hard, but I think that's just what we needed. I was becoming dependent and you were becoming suffocated. I've learned a lot this year about myself and about us but the most important thing I've learned is that you are a great friend and those only come along every so often. Even though you don't talk much, you still listen. Even though you don't cry with me, you're still patient. I couldn't ask for any more. Thanks so much for an awesome year.   To my Nicole ... You're at Murray and I'm at Bedford yet we're still this close . We have the most retarded conversations sometimes, but hey, what are friends for right? I've known you since grade 5, but we didn't really become close friends until recently. I'm thinking the wait was worth it. You're amazing. Always there to listen and give me your two cents. Never condescending or impatient. You know just what to say and when to say it. You've opened my eyes to a lot of things and I'll never forget it. I know I can always count on you in spite of the distance. You've been a great friend and I know there's so much more in store for us in the coming years.  To my Mark ... It's only been a few weeks but you're amazing. You always make me smile and I love being with you. I feel so safe in your arms and like I can really be myself when we're together. I gotten a lot of bad apples in the past but you're something else. You're that good thing I've been waiting for. Trust me, the wait was well worth it. You're more than I could ever ask for in a boyfriend and I don't think you'll ever know how happy you make me. You're understanding and patient, sweet and kind, everything a girl could ever want in a guy. I'm so glad I found you. I feel like the luckiest girl when we're together.   The sadness that comes with the end of a school year is just beginning to sink in now. The thought of possibly never seeing some of these people again scares me. The idea that we'll never be ask close as we once were crushes my heart. This year has been by far one of the best ever for me. In some ways though, it's also been the shittiest. I've changed and grown a lot this year and I'm at a place where I'm happy with me and my surroundings (minus the leaving friends). Things won't stay like this forever, but I'm going to enjoy it while I can. Again, thanks to everyone who's made this year one to remember. I'll never forget you. And to those who will be around for a little while longer, I love you and I wouldn't pick anyone else to face the future with!

      It's been a fairly interesting week or two. I haven't updated in a while, I know. I kind of got grounded for a while there, so I couldn't update. It was beyond my control. Anyway ... dance recital was last night. Jasmin, Mark and Sara went to watch me. Boy I feel loved. The family was having a party last night too so I just told the 3 of them to come over and party it up with the old asians. Oh man, it was quite the night. Coors Light = not good to play High/Low with. Woo wee. Syr spit it all out on everyone because he's a pussy and couldn't take it. What a retard. Everyone was so drunk. Note to self: avoid karaoke machines when drunk. Intoxicated singers and dancers are quite amusing. Sara, Jas, Mark and I sat on the stairs watching all the people sing and dance. It was hilarious and a half.   So, things with Mark are progressing nicely. I like him a lot. I can just be me with him; I'm not insecure about our relationship at all. I could show up in an old t-shirt and some ripped jeans and know that he'll still like me as much as he would if I were all fancied up. We've been doing a lot of stuff, I've gone farther with him than I had initially intended to. We talked about that too and decided that we should slow it down a bit. I mean, I don't regret anything I've done with him, it's just that we ARE moving too fast and I really don't want to do something I'll regret. He's an awesome guy and he's so understanding and just ... ahh, so amazing. The family likes him too, I think. Which is a good thing. Hehe.

      Will things between Jasmin and I ever be the same again? I mean, I know friendships change and grow, but will we ever be as close as we once were? What we had was something special and it lasted for such a short time. It seems to unfair. We hung out last night, me, Jay, Mark and Jasmin and, I don't know about the rest of them, but it was an awesome time. I miss those times with Jasmin. We barely talk anymore, but when we hang out we have so much fun and we're always laughing. I miss being able to talk to her and tell her stuff. She wasn't always the best person to talk to because she didn't talk back and didn't have much advice to give but I miss that feeling of being comfortable enough to tell her anything. I wonder if she misses me too. And we've talked about this before but it didn't really go anywhere. You can't have a talk and then decide that you're best friends again. These things come with time. However, I might just be the most impatient person on the face of the earth so that doesn't really work for me. Sigh.   Mark is in Calgary. I miss him. How sad is that? I suppose distance is a true test of faith or whatever, but come on. It's been like 2 weeks. And I think his best friend is hot. That is sooo bad. Hahaha. I kinda have problems looking Mark in the face. Erm, yeah. I really like him for who he is and all, but he's not much of a looker. I'm not saying that I like him any less because of it; I've always prided myself in being able to see the inner beauty and all that crap but stiiiiiill ... TRACY MCGRADY or BRAD PITT!!! Is that so much to ask for? Ok, don't answer that.

      Yes. Dez is definitely hot. Damn. I will have him some day. Mark my words.  I found a dress today for grad. It's long and black and spaghetti strapped. I like it. I fell in love with it the minute I tried it on. Sure, I probably should have gotten something a little more colorful, but black goes with everything so it doesn't matter what color Mark wears. Besides, black is slimming and god knows I need to slimmed. Hahaha.   Ho hum. I'm such a lucky girl. Why do I need other people to tell me this before I can realize it for myself? I think I'm crazy.

      Ho hum. Sitting in the library during english class doing a whole lot of nothing while I'm supposed to be doing a whole lot of something. I should be researching apartheid, but obviously, I'm not. I'm kinda just sitting here as my brain slowly rots away.   This is really quite boring. Grad dress shopping this weekend. Mark is wearing blue. I wanna wear black and red. Do blue, black and red go together? I don't think so. Maybe we can pull it off anyway. Hmm ...   So I still don't know whether we're officially dating or not. We're just kinda, in the middle. I suppose it's ok, but something a little more official would be nice. Oh well, I'm not complaining. It's not like things are horrible.  Anyhow, nothing else to write. Maybe update later. Should I give this URL out? I think it would be smarter not to. For now, anyway.  PS Why does he like me? WHY? I need to work on my sense of self worth and gain some self esteem. Right now, I have no clue as to why he likes me. It's really ridiculous. How could any guy see in me what Mark sees in me? It's so strange having a guy think that I'm pretty and actually worth something more than a night of drunken fun. I suppose I'll just stop thinking about it so much and just take it one day at a time... maybe then I'll get better at this whole being a girlfriend thing and maybe I'll get used to the idea that a guy actually likes me. I doubt it, but I can still hope right?

      Ok, I'm back again. Just got in tonight from Notre Dame basketball camp. Was a good time. Made some new friends, got to know some really annoying basketball players. But hey, you can't have everything right? Mark and Sara came to pick me up ... thanks guys, you're awesome!   So tired. So sore. Jammed my finger before lunch today and it's still swollen like mad. I can't bend it for shit.  Birthday on Wednesday. Apparently I'm going somewhere tomorrow with one of the girls from work to do something for my birthday since she won't be in town that day. Something about taking a picture? I don't get it. Anyway, hopefully it will be fun. But Jen's awesome and we always have fun together, so yeah. Whee. I need sleep, like nobody's business.  PS I could really go for a slurpee. Right now.  Yup.

      Was reading through my old livejournal and I found this: a list of the things I learned during my grade 10 year.   - Don't trust too easily, it'll come back and bite you right in the ass - Just because people listen doesn't mean they care - There are a LOT of fake people in high school, especially in grade 10 - There's a difference between a truly good & trustworthy friend and someone you can just have a good time with - People will go very far to get attention - Getting stabbed in the back hurts - Trust builds up slowly and over time but can be broken in a matter of seconds - Not everybody lies- Fighting with your best friend sucks- Boys lie- Don't go looking for everything, sometimes if you just sit back, what you're looking for will come to you - If your gut says don't do it ... FOR GOD'S SAKE, DON'T DO IT!!! Your own intuition is probably the most accurate feeling ever - Don't get too attatched to anything/anyone because eventually, it/they will walk out of your life as quickly as they walked in &nbsp;- What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger - If you pull through, everything will be ok in the end - There is an easy way out of everything shitty, but the tougher road has so many more rewards - You will never be perfect - Sometimes, friendships are better than sexual relationships - You just have to shake some things off - Forgive, but never forget - Tequila's disgusting - Friends come and go, but there will always be a few AWESOME ones that stick around - You know they're a keeper when you can tell them anything and they won't pass judgement - The greatest things show up in the most unexpected places - Sometimes, all you need is a good hug - Even the shittiest days have something good to them - When life is just sucking major ass, you will eventually reach a point where you can't go any lower and things will begin to look up - Life is never stable, everything is always changing - People (and their morals) CHANGE (not disappear), even you (and yours) - Sometimes it's easier to talk to a stranger about your problems - If you've made a bad first impression on someone, it's veeery hard to redeem yourself - Life is so much easier when you're not trying to be somebody you're not - Change isn't always bad - Don't turn the wheel too far when turning or you'll hit a boulevard - Things aren't always what they seem - Everything happens for a reason  So a lot of these things contradict what I'm doing now. For example, I know I'll never be perfect so why do I keep trying in the most wrong way? I don't know. I've learned all these things, but for some reason I keep trying to change the facts. So yes, I know all these things are true but I just don't want to accept it.  On another note ... still just trying to be me. Trying to find my place in the world. Kinda lost. Kinda ok with that.

      Apparently "Sorry? Come again?" isn't the right&nbsp;response to something along the lines of "I love you." Oops. I suck at this.   Ok, this feeling of vulnerability is a new thing to me. I'm used to being in control, I'm used to having the upper hand. This is not something I've had to deal with before. I don't know what to do. Do I tell him? I want to. But part of me doesn't so I'm thinking I should hold off until all of me does. Last time I didn't listen to my heart I got thrown to the ground so hard it's not even funny. So yes, intuition wins this time.

      Eating pizza and drinking root beer at midnight on a completely empty stomach is not a good thing. Nope, not at all. However, leaving 29 voicemail messages on someone's phone is. Haha, good times.

      So we're watching the Butterfly Effect right? Yeah, well I decide to get up to go get my blankie. So I'm walking along and on my way back, my uncle comes from behind the corner and says "Hey". He scared the shit outta me and I ended up crying. Lol, I've never been scared like that before.

      A wise woman (Miss Lindsay) once told me that she liked to keep what she thought of love very simple: love is love. Well, I don't like arguing with wise women, but I beg to differ. Love is indeed love. But there is so much more to that word. Love is anything but simple, even when we try to make it so. Love is great and everyone should experience it in some shape or form at sometime during their life.   To me, love is a lot of things. Love is what you make of it. Love is smiling through the tears and seeing beauty where no one else will try to. Love is getting butterflies in your stomach from a single glance and being able to be yourself around that certain someone. Love is acceptance of the person, flaws and all. Love is a big risk with big consequences but also with bigger rewards. Love is not being able to live without the other person. Love is the willingness to give the relationship your all. Love is taking the jump because you have faith in the other person to catch you before you hit the ground. Love is a rollercoaster ride for the heart, and who doesn't love rollercoasters? Love is listening to the other person talk about nothing just to be able to hear the sound of their voice. Love is being able to say what you want to say because you know that won't change what the other person thinks of you. Love is being able to talk for hours about nothing. Love is arguing over the smallest things and then making up 10 minutes later. Love is sacrificing that last piece of pie, cake or that last candy to make the person happy. Love is amazing because when you see the person you love, you feel refreshed. You feel like a little girl with her first crush again because the butterflies never really go away. Love is when that person still makes you go all tingly and makes your brain turn to mush (haha). To me, all this, and so much more that I can't put into words, is love. I don't think there is one set definition for love. I mean there is; if you open any dictionary you'll see it. But I believe that love is what you make of it and what you make it out to be. Each person defines love in their own way and according to their own morals. This is my definition of love. Accept it if you would like, and if not, that's ok too. This definition will probably change somewhat as I grow and learn, but right now, these are the words I put to the ineffable feeling.  I've defined love as all these great things, but I'm still afraid of it. Well, I'm not afraid of love as much as I'm afraid of what comes from it. The heartache and the pain that love causes is something I would like to put off for as long as possible. However, I also want to put myself out there and experience love without holding back. This is where the problem lies: I want to love and be loved but I don't want to face the consequences. Now I just can't win. There can't be one without the other, and I know this, yet I still try to find a way around the whole hurting part. Someday though, I have faith that a truly amazing guy will come and sweep me off my feet and bring out the little girl in me. The little girl who was more than ready to try anything and throw herself into something without looking back. Maybe that day isn't too far off ...

      So she said what's the problem baby What's the problem I don't know  Well maybe I'm in love (love)  Think about it every time I think about it Can't stop thinking 'bout it  How much longer will it take to cure this Just to cure it cause I can't ignore it if it's love (love)  Makes me wanna turn around and face me but I don't know nothing 'bout love   Come on, come on  Turn a little faster Come on, come on  The world will follow after Come on, come on  Cause everybody's after love  So I said I'm a snowball running  Running down into the spring that's coming all this love  Melting under blue skies  Belting out sunlight  Shimmering love   Well baby I surrender  To the strawberry ice cream Never ever enter all this love Well I didn't mean to do it  But there's no escaping your love  These lines of lightning  Mean we're never alone,  Never alone, no, no   Come on, Come on Move a little closer  Come on, Come on I want to hear you whisper Come on, Come on  Settle down inside my love  Come on, come on  Jump a little higher Come on, come on If you feel a little lighter Come on, come on  We were once Upon a time in love   We're accidentally in love   I'm In Love, I'm in Love,  I'm in Love, I'm in Love,  I'm in Love, I'm in Love,  Come on, come on Spin a little tighter Come on, come on  And the world's a little brighter Come on, come on  Just get yourself inside her   Love ...I'm in love

      Empty feeling in the pit of my stomach and I don't know why. Feeling kinda sad/depressed for no apparent reason. This can only lead to things of no goodness. I need to get out. Workin tonight. Then what? Perhaps go karting? That would be dandy.

      I hope you never lose your sense of wonder You get your fill to eat, but always keep that hunger May you never take one single breath for granted God forbid love ever leave you empty handed  I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance and when you get the choice to sit it out or dance I hope you dance, I hope you dance  I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance Never settle for the path of least resistance Living might mean taking chances, but they're worth taking Loving might be a mistake but it's worth making Don't let some hell bent heart leave you bitter When you come close to selling out, reconsider Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance  And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance I hope you dance (time is a wheel in constant motion always) I hope you dance (rolling us along) I hope you dance (tell me who wants to look back on their youth and wonder) I hope you dance (where those years have gone)

      Ho hum. Summer has been pretty slow thus far. Working mainly.   Leaving on Monday for 2 weeks to Vancouver. Excited? YES. I need a break, a change, to get away from all this here. It gets tiring after a while. And don't tell me you don't know what I'm talking about!   Oh shit. I still need to register for Notre Dame. Ah, shiiiiit. I don't want to go by myself but I don't want to go elite either. What to do, what to do... ho hum.   Pointless entry. More later, perhaps!

      I really have no idea what's going on inside my head right now. All these emotions have come out of no where and all ganged up on me. I don't know what to do. On the one hand, my heart is telling me to do one thing but on the other hand, my head is ordering me in the opposite direction. i'm so confused and I don't know what to do. So I give up. Yup.

      Happy Birthday, Cyndi.  Sweet Sixteen. Aren't those words supposed to mean something like, you're going to have a great year or something? I really would like for this year to be something else being as how all the rest of my years have been something else, in a completely different sense. I think it's time for my life to take a sudden turn and take me somewhere other than this depressing state of mind I've been in for the past few years. Oh well, I guess only time will tell.  I'm so tired.
