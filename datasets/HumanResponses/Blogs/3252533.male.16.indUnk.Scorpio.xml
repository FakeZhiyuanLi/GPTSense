      College today was fun.. 9:30 - 11am only. I went to internet lab 11-12:30pm.. The lecturers were having a meeting of some sort. So, half day of Telecommunications.. Was kinda fun, cuz Jason was funny. Later, as I was waiting at the bench for mum and dad, suddenly I got a call. They went out with Uncle & Aunt for lunch. I had to eat myself. I went to the restaurant operated my the Hotel and Tourism (H&T) guys at my colllege. No 1st class service, but decent service lah. I had this pie that costed RM6.. reasonable lah.  I met Sean Paul. He's from Sarawak, dad's a politician, mum's Filipino. He's 23 now, but just 1 year my senior. He was studying Civil Engineering at INTI Sarawak, but middle into year 2, he sort flunked a couple of subjects a couple of times. Quit INTI Sarawak and decided to come to KDU Penang instead. His girlfriend's in Penang, so.. that's the main reason he's here. Ahh... Neway, we had lunch together.  The apartment we were looking to buy wasn't good. It housed sick patients, lotsa "tourists" looking for a spot to live. The apartment is very nice, but unfortunatelly, there are drug addicts lurking nearby... and lotsa sick people! Dang.. they're like waiting for medical attention in the hospitals nearby. The lifts are darn slow.. you'll prolly have to wait at least 10 minutes everytime! So stupid.   As for now, we're staying at our present apartment. Its abit far from college, but I'll be driving soon, so that's good =)  Remember to visit  urlLink My site  and  urlLink My blog

      Phew, end of the week already. Lets recap.  Thursday afternoon was BM classes with Puan Suraya. Today we did some Fahaman, and believe me, its much tougher than O Levels. No doubt I got credit for O's, but if I were to take the test here, I would surely merely Pass. It is a great experience, I can testify. I met some Hotel and Tourism guys. They're all a fun bunch. Breaktime, we went down the cafeteria.. For once we all had lots to sembang about. Kenneth was a fun guy... with anti American setiments. His ambition is to be chef is large cruise ships. Also, he had experience working at Shangri-la. Ah well..  Friday telecom class. The supposed test didn't turn out to be true. But Jason promised this coming Friday we'll have a test. The new National Service girl came. Forgot her name... but she's the pleasant type. Nothing much happened except the usual tech / telecom discussions. We're into networking and networking fabrics now... (i.e. telephone wires, coaxial, and fiber) Its fun!  Saturday, today went for Micro-app. We did some MS Dos commands and played around abit. It was basic, thus deemed boring by someone as leet as myself. Everyone knew how DOS worked. As usual, the challenging part of this subject is to put our knowledge in words. Thankfully, I have Computer Studies experience. Woot!!  Later I'll be off to BM for the weekend. I received an SMS from Radiance that I might be needed as backup singer for the youth meeting tonight. Can't wait for that :P Then, Sunday we'll attend church, then go to granny's. We're gonna get the orchard cleared up abit. I might have to go college on Monday by bus. Take the 7:30 from BM to Komtar, then, hop onto another bus to Burma / Anson Road hopefully by 9:30am where KDU is located. It has been done before, and its quite an exciting thing... for one, I'm a public transport virgin and for another... its like.. "independence" ya know.. Now that mum and dad are staying together with me, I'm pretty much under scruntany.. not that it's a bad thing.. but I love freedom.  So as usual, I'll be afk (away from keyboard) till Monday afternoon after college. Happy weekend, everybody! And visit http://bmbc.info , ok? Sorry about piptech.org not working!

      Last Friday, Telecommunications class with Jason. We started the more technical parts of Telecom now.. with complex Physics terminologies and such. It was okay, just need some reading up. We're far behind the schedule, cuz usually when we discuss about something, other things pop up! Ev3r so often, we're distracted from the original thing. I think we were talking about Radio waves & Communications. Then, he said something about Astro. We all know that Astro is satellite, and that's another topic.  So, Jason actually worked for Astro for a period of time. He brought up the issue of hacked Astro cards and said that Astro actually knew those who are stealing their services. A mate of mine said that his whole neighbourhood are using hacked cards. I mean, pay a one time fee, and you're FREE from pesky subscription charges. It costs about Rm 130 a month for all packages here in Malaysia, so, in a year, its about Rm 1500 in fees. Then, he talked about spot beams... that Astro has a big "footprint", yes.. basically, if you're in China, India or Philippines, or even West Australia, you can get Astro reception. However, a concentrated "beam" is sent to an area (for example, Kampong Beribi in Brunei).. then, the computer calculates how many signals "reflect". Its sort of like a "ping" and then, they check with their subsciption records for people who paid. If they get more "pings", that means someone's not paying.  Actually, its kinda foolish for people not wanting to pay AT ALL. It'll be too obvious dammit! I wonder what guts it took you to go to the Astro office and say, "I don't want your service anymore". I mean, Astro is god. There's no other competition, and its programs are top dawg, other that the annoying local ads. If you don't pay a cent, you're telling them "I have a dish at home... er.. I ain't gonna use it". So, word of advice for hacked cards users "pay the cheapest subscription (and use your hacked card)". If you don't pay at all, they know something is going amiss.. If convincted, you'll be fined Rm 100,000 here in Malaysia and possible jail sentence; doesn't matter whether or not you produced the cards, as long as you're using it.  Btw, my Telecom lecturer happens to be an "ex" American grad phone phreaker, and hacker. He's Malaysian chinese but the accent, attitude and all is there =) Owns an audio shop, I believe, with RM60k turntables at his disposal and WiFi network at home :P Very fun guy. Today (thursday), there's gonna be a Engineering Society meeting with elections and all, basically an AGM. Hope I get selected.. thus improving my chances for a merit scholarship :P  Later that day, came back, rested. Arrived BM at 4pm, picked up a church friend, and set off for Sungai Petani. Its actually about 50 km away... but accessable via highway. In case you don't know.. the highways here have 110km/h speed limits, thus... its not "luar biasa" if you see cars zooming at 140-160km/h. Speed traps are set tho.. and you have the option to (a) bribe the cop (b) give lame excuse and escape altogether (c) pay the fine. Hahah..  Arrived at  urlLink Cinta Sayang Golf and Country Resort  by 6:30pm. Tonight tho, some church members hadn't arrived yet. That night, it was dinner by the golf driving range. FOUR!  Next morning, more friends came. Almost everybody was there. The Youth, little kids and adults were separated into their separate groups with Ps. Alex Chong ministering to the adults, Unc. Micheal and Aunt. Hannah with the Youth (fun guys) and their daughter Joanne playing with the kids. If you look through the  urlLink photos here , basically, it tells you the whole story lah.  Throughout Friday, Saturday and Sunday, there was non stop, high octane action and amusement. Certainly there was time of worship and bible teaching, then the games, and the swimming in the evenings. The thing about camps is that, for the first days, you really think its tiring and a bore, and when its time to head home, you miss it. Luckily, I was well prepared (mentally)!! And.. actually loved the whole experience.  urlLink Aiyah.. just browse through the pictures lah! .  I made new friends, and grew closer to older ones. It was fun. The activities organised were well planned and all. uncle Shannon, an entertainer by profession showed kids, youth and adults alike some of his "geng" magic tricks. Phew.. such fast hands to deceive the eyes, and the mind.  Monday, packed, and went home with a teary eye. Not teary because of missing the camp, rather the thought of gaining knowledge of the one and only God almighty and the lessons learnt. Arrived home by evening and was too tired.. just slept till 9pm before going for dinner. Tuesday, still in BM, we did absolutely nothing. Mum had the clothes washed, dad did the gardening, I watched TV (no computer there!!). Evening visited granny tho, and the Siamese temple my dad grew up in. Too bad I was out of "ammo" to take pictures of the temple. Recently our Chief Minister  urlLink Tan Sri Koh Tsu Koon  visited the temple and He and His guys were tasting some "masakan kampung". They liked the Thai dish "kilek" so much that they promised to return for more soon! Apparently, the temple's chef's secret was excessive "santan".... That's what granny said. Granny could cook better "kilek"! She's got a tree in the orchard.  Oh, and its durian season again. Finally, after a year of fruitlessness, those thony fruits have finally sprouted. Its not fully riped, but when it is, it'll automatically drop down. Durian tree is a special tree which requires minimal attention yet producing rich, tasty fruits. There were about 40 trees brearing fruits... kinda cool to see all those durians on the trees. Maybe in a month or two, we should have some fruits ;-) I'll report to you the taste and all. There was also campedak fruit and other small ones. We left granny's at 7pm, and tapau some kampung eggs. Small and cute, but yummier than "normal" eggs. It is said kampung products are always better than the mainstream. Its true! I wonder what about kampung "chics" ;-) ;-) ;-)  Wednesday (yesterday).. at 9am, we went to the IC department to collect mum's MyKad. After 6 months+ of processing, its finally done. I took control of the car, while parents lined up. And a minute later, I was lucky enough to land in a parking slot. Whopee. Oh, earlier the previous night, I drove from the dinner place (Tenang restaurant) back home. Its about 1km+, but my driving was near flawless. So smooth, so lancar. I'm leet now. Afternoon, I rushed to this courier service to collect my mail. I won this voucher for Rm 100 in Thai food in KL. Gonna give it to my sis. Then, was slightly late for Maths class. There was a test today, so we were pretty spread out. It was all on Surds and Rational Numbers. I think I did okay, with 1 or 2 errors. But what the heck. Its 10% of the semester total, but yeah.. I did fine.  Thursday. My day started at 3am. Wanted to watch the Chelsea Champion's League match. Watched for a good 10 minutes then said to myself "Argh.. i'm no chelsea supporter! Everyone knows I love  urlLink Man United . What the heck? I went online instead and was surprised to find  urlLink San Fui  online. Talked to her abit. Apparently she was under exam stress. Sigh~ sometimes other people expect too much, and when numbers are programmed into your mind, your "panic quotient" just skyrockets. If you're kind hearted, ask her to calm down and think less about all the worries lah. Full time, Chelsea 2 - Monaco 2.. Monaco meets Porto in the Champion's League Final. Visit  urlLink Soccernet  for full report. Ah well, the team that narrowly beat Man United contraversially is now in the Finals. Nevermind. Its all right. Its 11am now, and I'll rest abit before going for BM classes this afternoon. After that, there's a 2 hour Eng. Society meeting, so look forward to that. I might report back tonight, if given the opportunity.  Thanks for visiting, and sorry for the server downtime.  urlLink Pinchpenny is cheap, but sucks . Oh, tell everyone you know about Piptech.org by adding this "signature" to your e-mail... or by word of mouth of MSN. Tell 'em "Visit piptech.org today!" =) I owe you one, dude and dudettes!

      Sorry about the slighly blurred pictures. My hands were shakey... or perhaps I didn't know 100% how to use this digital camera. Seems like good ol' fashion ones take better pictures. Sigh~ Advancements... one step forward, two step backwards!  I think I can claim that there are a good 100 "clear" pictures lah.. tell me which ones you're interested in ;) Good day, all! Mail me: pip@piptech.org if you are a BMBC youth who wants to try out this "blogging" thing.

      Here's what I read today... Just want to share   Sometimes it doesn't take much to get us down, does it? An unkind remark from a friend, bad news from the auto mechanic, a financial set back, or misbehaving child can put a cloud of gloom over everything, even on the sunniest day. You know you should be joyful, but everything seems to be against you, making simple tasks a struggle.  David must have been feeling that way when he wrote Psalm 6. He felt weak and sickly, troubled, forsaken, weary, and grief-stricken. But he knew what to do when he was down. He looked up and trusted God to take care of him and to see him through.   When we look up and focus on God, something good happens. We get our eyes off ourselves and gain a new appreciation of Him.  Next time you're down, try looking up to God. He is sovereign; He loves you; He considers you special; He has a purpose for your trials.  Yes, life can seem unbearable at times. But don't let it keep you down. Meditate on God's goodness, talk to Him, and know that He hears you. That will give you strength to get up when you're down.  Come, ye disconsolate, where'er ye languish - Come to the mercy seat, fervently kneel; Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish: Earth has no sorrow that heav'n cannot heal.

      In Shakespeare's time, mattresses were secured on bed frames by ropes. When you pulled on the ropes the mattress tightened, making the bed firmer to sleep on. That's where the phrase, "goodnight, sleep tight" came from.  The phrase "rule of thumb" is derived from an old English law which stated that you couldn't beat your wife with anything wider than your thumb.  It was the accepted practice in Babylon 4,000 years ago that for a month after the wedding, the bride's father would supply his son-in-law with all the mead he could drink. Mead is a honey beer, and because their calendar was lunar based, this period was called the "honey month" or what we know today as the "honeymoon."  In ancient England a person could not have sex unless you had consent of the King (unless you were in the Royal Family). When anyone wanted to have a baby, they got consent of the King & the King gave them a placard that they hung on their door while they were having sex. The placard had F.U.C.K. (Fornication Under Consent of the King) on it. Now you know where that came from..

      Scam alert! I got this in my e-mail and I feel suspecious!  From Marc Hunter   reply to: hunter/xxxx... (lotsa stuff) Subject: Could you please verify your e-mail address!  Hi there, You are receiving this message because automated spam detection software has flagged your recent email to me as suspicious, and it did not recognize your email address. If you simply reply to this message, your original message will go through and you will not be asked to do this again. Sorry for the incovenience, and thank you for your understanding. Rgds, Marc   I warn against replying. I have a sneaky feeling that if you DO reply, you'll be subjected to bombardment of pr0n advertisements and spam. I know of no "marc hunter" and certainly didn't e-mail him. I bet that he e-mailed everyone on Hotmail, and if you reply, you're telling him "Here I am... now, send me pr0n spam."  Good day, all.. I'm off to college soon and meet up with  urlLink Ruth

      A poor man in Ireland was plodding along toward home, carrying a huge bag of potatoes. A horse and wagon finally drew alongside him on the road, and the driver invited the man to climb aboard. After getting on the wagon, he sat down but continued to hold the heavy bag.        When the driver suggested that the man set the bag down in the wagon, he replied, "I don't want to trouble you too much, sir. You are giving me the ride already, so I'll just carry the potatoes."       "How foolish of him!" we say. Yet sometimes we do the same thing when we attempt to bear the burdens of our lives in our own strength. No wonder we become weary and overwhelmed with anxiety and fear.       In Psalm 55, David spoke of anxiety he felt because his enemies were attacking him (vv. 1-15). But then he gave his concerns to the Lord and was filled with renewed hope and confidence (vv.16-23). That's why he could write, "Cast your burden on the Lord, and He shall sustain you" (v. 22)       When we recall the story of the man and his bag of potatoes, remember the simple lesson it illustrates: Rather than trying to bear your burdens by yourself, set them down in God's hands.       Give Him each perplexing problem, All your needs to Him make known;     Bring to Him your daily burdens - Never carry them alone!    Just want to share these words

      Well, am in college now. I'm having a 10:15 - 11:15am break courtesy of the Semiconductor lecturer, Mr Babu. Apparently, some guys from Northumbria, UK are coming over to check the facilities and the programmes here. He's one of the main guys of this School of Engineering, so.. he has to be present. Btw, this semiconductor class is the most hardest subject this semester. Thankfully, the others are reasonably easy.  Driving today just improved. More lancar now. I'm hopeful that by this coming Saturday, I will be allowed to drive to Church for the youth meeting :P woot woot.  Tests are coming up. We're almost approaching the middle of the term. Wow, time flies.  I'm very happy because the blog at  urlLink BMBC Youth  is doing great. We have Jason, Daniel and Vivien on board now, so.. I'm anticipating an active blog like  urlLink these girls . Maybe by the end of the month, we should have about 10 bloggers. Wheeee!!!  In other news, I'll be going mountain climbing (more like a hill) with Aunt Lily tomorrow morning. Class tomorrow only begins at 2pm, so that's good. We'll wake up at 6:30 and be there by 7:30am. Its gonna be a good exercise as the last time I remebered exercising was....  Anyhow, life has been great as usual. College friends are great, and I've grown closer to a few. Basically, with that, I can get and offer help whenever necessary. Its good to build a network of study partners. Meanwhile, I need to work on my internet addiction. I think I spend close to 20 hours a week surfing the internet and on other net related activities (chat, surf, mail, blog, website management). Hope to cut that down before the exams.

          Today, May 11th is Adele Poh's birthday!   In other news, there will be only 5 "posts" on the mainpage. This is to encourage fresh content. So, if you wanna see older posts, just click on the "archives". Glad to finally have Jason on. Hope that we all can post some encouraging e-mail and forwards on this blog.  As for the layout, I hope to get a nicer one soon.  urlLink Check this out ... hope to get help from these people :P Also, there is a function to "Upload" files, more specifically pictures. So, please resize pictures to MAXIMUM  320x240  pixels or else it would look ugly. Thanks!  So today I'll again be driving to college with dad by my side. This will go on for the whole week, then next week I'll be alone. Its fun, and abit nervy, but I can cope. Good day and enjoy the new layout!

      I am in too.. Well, guess I would have one more thing to do every time when I go online starting from tonight, that is to keep updated with you bloggers. I'm glad all of us pool our resources and time together to form a virtual cafe where we can keep in contact always. Sad :) I have one month time before I leave my hometown, guess it would be a long long time before I'll be back in BM after I left.  It would be great to see that this blogging thingy can last, hope it is publisized officially and permanently as our BMBc Youth's online cafe. "Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven." Matthew 5:16

      Welcome to the blog, Vivien! Glad to have you on board! It would be great if we could invite Jason, Daniel.. and anyone not in BM in 3-4 months time to blog with us. That way, we can continue to keep ourselves updated on things and happenings in our lives.  Well, the Sarawak pictures are up  urlLink here  so do check that out. Otherwise, you still can see Keston's Contributions  urlLink here .  I'm in college now, Learning computer fundamentals. Its really fundamental to me, but the class is going at snail pace.   In other news, I managed to "hack" one of our friend's e-mail. Its mainly due to weak passwords. SO a word of advice, create tough to guess passwords in the future.. like... ph1Lip90210 or some weird combination! :D Good day all!

      Finally there is some life at piptech.org .. but guess what? They screwed up all my files! They're all gone! All my hard work in setting up piptech.org!! GONE!!   I'm in BM now. I drove mum to The Summit, a shopping mall. Its Mother's Day.. and she's being pampered at the hair saloon. I'm now at the Cybercafe lah. Wow.. I drove from church, to makan place and back home.. These are not ordinary big wide streets. These are the streets of ancient Bukit Mertajam.. Where.. there are NO rules. I survived and am glad.  Parking at the basement was thrilling. COntrolling the clutch and brakes. Thank God I didn't make any scratch on dad's car. My driving is leet. Tomorrow (Monday).. I'll drive to college, with dad by my side. Will see how it goes! I'm overly excited! :P :P  Later, we'll be going home, and do some gardening. The orchard at Granny's is almost done... and maybe next weekend, we should be getting some durian now... This coming week, college will be exams on Friday and small quiz on Tuesday.  Oh, and church has some plans this weekend. Firstly, we're visiting the hospital and doing a dance to entertain the sick. Its all part of our church's community services. So.. its gonna be fun hangin' out with my buddies after Sunday service. As for Sat. youth meeting, I'll be worship leading. Phew! Yesterday, I was backup singer.. now I lead? Big step.. but I'm confident I can deliver! Heheh  Youth is a small group of 20ish. The pastor is Ps. Tamil.. he's the Charismatic type. A bit disturbing, but I'm starting to accept him now. We were all uncomfortable with his style of ministrying to us youths, but I guess we can all compromise. So, next week, worship lead (whooppee).. and that's about it.  Gday all. And thanks for staying faithful (despite piptech.org being down).

      What I read today...  Grant Murphy of Seattle was the active type, a man who ran at full throttle. Idling and coasting were not in his nature. "One might even call him hyperactive," recalled a dear friend.  	The multiple sclerosis began to slow Grant down. First he needed crutches to get around. Then he was limited to sitting in a chair. Finally he was confined to a bed.  	Near the end, he was hardly strong enough to talk. His friend recalls, however, that "he expressed only joy and thankfulness with a constant anticipation of being in the Lord's presence." Not long before he died, Grant whispered Romans 15:13 to a friend. He repeated the words "in believing," then added, "I can't do anything now."  	It's when we can't do anything that God does everything. And herein lies a profound paradox of the Christian's experience. Faith is simultaneously an exercise of our will and the impartation of divine strength. And from that marvelous mixture spring joy and peace and an abundance of hope.  	Are you in a total helpless situation? Strength gone? All options exhausted? If you have trusted Jesus as your Savior, God will Strengthen you to keep on believing. As you trust Him, He'll give you not only joy and peace, but also hope when all hope is gone.  When we are weak and in despair,  Our mighty God is near; He'll give us strength and joy and hope, And calm our inner fear.  No one is hopeless whose hope is in God...

      Just want to share what I read...  In his book Christians in the Marketplace, Bill Hybels says that people outside the faith often say, “Show me” before they say, “Tell me.”  	I knew a young man in Germany named Wolfgang who modeled Hybels’ principle at a building site where he worked. As an enthusiastic believer, Wolfgang always read his Bible during lunch. Though his fellow workers jeered, he didn’t stop his daily reading. He simply prayed for a way to demonstrate Christ’s love for them.  	When the workers went home at night, they always left their muddy boots behind. Wolfgang began staying late after work to clean their boots. The men were puzzled at first but then realized that Wolfgang was the only one among them who would perform this humble service. Not only did they come to respect him, but sometimes they even asked him to read the Bible to them. Only eternity will reveal the full effect of Wolfgang’s shining life. But this we know: When his co-workers saw his good works, they started listening to his God.   	Jesus said, “Let your light so shine before men, that they may... glorify your father in heaven” (Matthew 5:16). If you long to lead the people around you to Jesus, radiate His Love by doing practical deeds for God’s glory alone.  My life was dark until the Light shone in, That Light was Christ, who saved me from my sins; His light that I’ve received I long to share In loving deeds for people everywhere.  A Christian’s life is a window  through which others can see Jesus.

      Well... a surprising news. A 30 year old soon-to-be KING marrying a 17 year old girl that  urlLink my friend, Fui  used to play "Barbie Doll" with. Wow.. =) I'm shocked.  Congratulations to Prince Billah & Dk. Sarah binte Pengiran Haji Salleh Abdul Rahman. They're next in line to the throne.   urlLink from Brudirect.com   In other news, worship leading during youth meeting went well. We had a short 15 minute discussion about Conflicts. I'll type out the text when I have time. Very interesting. Anyhow, you can always search Google on conflicts.. :) Its good to know these sort of things.  The English premier league is over, and Ronaldo and Fletcher will be missing the final due to the red cards receieved during the last game of the season. That sucks. But I'm sure we can beat Milwall this coming Saturday, 9pm on Astro Supersports ;)  Sunday came and went. Nothing unusual.. We went to granny's orchard. We ate some durians and now I'm home. I think there's a test this week, now.. which subject it is..

      Since I'll be back less than a month from now.. I guess it's best that I can keep in contact with you bros and sis in Christ.

Thank God, the Youths and church camp helped a lot to bring me back closer to you.

      God sure knows how to teach His children.  Just now, at class around 11am, the Microapp teacher was teaching us to use Excel.. and asked us to draw a plan (diagram) using Excel. It was as fun as eating sand! Well, after finishing, she inspected my work, and concluded that it wasn't complete.  With a sour face, and an inflated ego, I gave her the middle finger salute. Had a giggle with my friends, and yes... that WAS satisfying.  Driving home, near the "underpass"... I wanted to go to the left lane in order to reach home. After signalling for 10 secs, still they don't give way. Suddenly, I look in front and I was so close to the Merz's bumper.. I swirved left, and nearly hit this motor cyclist. Asshole gave me the salute!  Haha.. isn't it amazing how God works?  Oh, I won't be going to Youth Meet today. Dad and mum have Malay wedding reception to attend. Oh well, guess I'll continue my Shrek 2 in CANTONESE, Confessions of hot chic and of course, Troy.. VCD galore.. and of course, study for my Semiconductor exams!

      Today after college, at 3pm ish.. I drove dad and mum to BM. This is the first time me driving across the famous Penang bridge. I nearly met an accident as there was a sudden "brake" near the Toll Plaza.. emergency braked.. luckily the air bags didn't pop up, or I get killed by the air bags!! lol..  it was frightening (for dad and mum).. I was reasonably cool and calm, altho abit shaken lah.. Overall, it thought me the "peraturan dua saat" I learnt once upon a time. Other than that, the whole journey to BM went smooth, I'm now l33t.  Talking about l33t.... Liang, Neil (collegemates) and I were on MSN talking l33t. Leet talk (or elite talk) is a language commonly used by hackers so that their messages cannot be intercepted or searched using a search engine. If I were to tell you "i'll be breaking into microsoft june 1st".. then, the FBI or whatever can Google these terms and find my website (gosh, no.. I don't have the experties to hack MS).  So, h4ck3r$ t4lK 1!k3 tH1$... and u$3 t3Rm$ l!k3 ph34r, l33t, p4wned (search around the web, there should be a leet dictionary somewhere). Its a fun language to learn and use while MSNing.. Rather than lousy SMS lingo.  Hi to cousin Li Tinh, Ruth, Jen, Radiance and all da nice people who managed to drop by piptech.org (through the bulletin board). Sorry for inconvenicen.. Just wanting them to post something in the Forums b4 arriving here.  =0  Neway, congrats to Vivi for getting Biochem, Danny for getting Dentistry (hey, its a blessing too.. u may earn your million in 5-10 years.. if u work hard!) also to Andreen (Chinese lit, whoa.. respect dude.. everytime I *try* to speak Manglish, u sure / can laugh at me... cuz I speak like ang-mo!) and to Jon.. whatever course u might be taking.. all da best!  =)  Dad and I watched the American Idol replay, the Finals on 8TV.... first song for Diana deGemuk was great, 2nd one abit lousy and 3rd one was a disaster. She was intimidated by Fantasia's wonderful performance.... Fantasia didn't start well, but her 2nd and 3rd song was out of this world. I'll buy her album when it comes ;) Remember Ruben Studdord, Clay Aiken and that Guy Sebastian (yea, Rach, I know u like him).  Listening to Bone Thugs, and D12. Gnite all, college at 9am tomorrow, hence 8am have to leave home, hence 7am have to wake up. And as usual, I'll be mia, afk (missing in action, away from keyboard) for the whole of Saturday and Sunday in Bukit Mertajam. ;-) Thanks for visiting!

      Well, yesterday was eventful. After the usual 2-5:30 pm date with Ms Voon, the Engineering Maths teacher, I headed for Komtar.. it was abit of a crawl.. but eventually, I found the BSN (bank simpanan).. the place where the badminton was on.  It was only about 6pm, so I went to Komtar there and Cybercafe-d.. Wasted RM 3 for an hour's of access, but what the heck :P At around 6:45pm, went for makan. I had yin yong.. which was excellent - at New Lane area.... 7:10pm, met the gang. And I was surprised!  Apparently, almost all of them are from Engineering. KDU Penang has 6-7 schools, but School of Engineering was the dominant one.. A few ppl I know, they're my senior. It was fun stuff, really.. cuz all of them played very well.. Even the girls were skilled. I had loads of fun, and oh.. I beat them all :P [brags]  Next Wed / Thu, I'll probably have supper with them. They usually have a gathering after the 9pm game... so that's kinda fun. Today, I'll skip badminton, my arms hurt badly... Its been 1/2 a year since I last played, see? But I was still reasonably at the top of my form. Wheee =)  Later that night, wrote some testimonials on Friendster and had fun ;) Nothing much happened, and I slept a bit late lah... 2:45am, my alarm woke me up. I woke up, shut it off.. and went back to bed. FC Porto and Monaco don't excite me. Probably the worst finals in Champions' League History! Ultimately, the class of Porto showed, and they won 3-0. Good for them... screw their coach! (who is apparently going to Chelsea next season).  Woke up as usual this morning... abit late, preparing my assignment (as below).. then 9:25am, went to the school computer lab to have it printed... Still got 50 pages in my Printing quota :-D must use puas puas! I'm staying back today for BM classes later with Puan Suraya... The cool teacha.. =) Gonna meet my buddies from H&T.. and have loadsa fun learning about the history of the Malay language, and how to improve my language in general.  5:30pm, shud reach home. Plan to sleep well, and rest my right arm... Still kinda hurts, and probably will read up my Semiconductor and Telecommunications and do some Maths. My Maths sucked. Only 8 marks out of 15.. and its all on Surds and rational numbers nia.. me so disgraceful. I can justify that my buddies also got around that region, highest being 8.75 marks nia.. but hey, gotta do better!!!  Man U has signed Alan Smith for 7 mil pounds. Well, he's a good buy, except his temper. He's known to get angered very easy. Surely will get lotsa red card wan, and tunnel burst up with his own team mate or manager. He's a tough guy, so.. hope he can score and provide for Man United in 90 days time. Till then, its boredom 100%!!! No footie, only Euro 2004.... But that's equally good too.  Next weekend, Olivia & Anthony are coming to Penang for a wedding, and on Sunday, dad and mum are going to KL for a wedding... So, they carpool and dad and mum take bus back to Penang lah. I'll be driving them, so that's l33t.  I've been starving myself the past few days.. eating less and all. Hopefully, my waist can reduce sikit to less then 36' lah... (now its around 37') and my weight, target: 160 pounds, 70kg... (now at 165 pounds oredi). I've been badmintoning abit, so my leg muscles are leet now... So firm. =) Sigh, how I wish my whole body was as mascular!  Do post in the  urlLink Forums / Community Discussion Boards . Start a topic, reply to a post.. just say anything that's on your mind. ALL ARE INVITED and your post will make me smile ;-)   Thank you.

      Today, as I was browsing the net, doing the usual online stuff, and of course the occasional thought about my Uni application feedback. This verse comes to mind :   29 He gives power to the weak, And to those who have no might He increases strength. 30 Even the youths shall faint and be weary, And the young men shall utterly fall, 31 But those who wait on the Lord Shall renew their strength; They shall mount up with wings like eagles, They shall run and not be weary, They shall walk and not faint.  ISAIAH 40:29-31  Wassup everyone?Hope you guys are doing great. As for me, things are just the usual..Hoping and Praying for the best... God bless ya everyone alwiz !!!

      let a = 1 and b = 1 a = b a2 = ab a2 - b2 = ab - b2 (a+b)(a-b)=b(a-b) a+b=b b+b=b 2b = b 2 = 1 !  Huh? 2 equals 1?

      DeGemuk? So harsh on her, anyway she doesn't understand!!  Let me clarify It wasn't all because of "symphaty votes" the fact is LaToya London's hometown had a power failure so the phone wasn't working...... I read bout it from The Star few weeks ago  those hum-sup lous should cast their vote for the Miss Universe contest, not the American Idol! They ruin the whole show!!

      Deep in a Wyoming canyon I came across the biggest porcupine I've ever seen. As he lumbered toward me, I watched him closely and gave him plenty of room. I was not about to get near a guy whose quills looked like missiles. No wonder he was alone!  But he's not alone all the time. Every November and December, porcupines get close enough to produce offspring. During that time they choose to relax their quills, then they return to their prickly selves.  In nearly every church, there will be porcupine or two, with sharp quills of criticism or sarcasm or arrogance. We want to avoid them, but God places us in communities of believers for fellowship. He commands us to love one another - including the porcupine types. And in our honest moments, we have to admit that we have quills too.   John wrote, "He who loves God must love his brother also" (1 John 4:21). To do this, we need to ask God to help us "relax our quills," even when other people are prickly. The Holy Spirit will help us stop being so defensive or critical or controlling, and enable us to love our Christian brothers and sisters. It's the way we show the world that we love God (John 13:35).  Some people can be difficult to love  And so we do not even try to care, But God says, "Love them just as I've loved you You'll bring Me glory as My love you share."  God loves you and me - let's love each other!

      Ya Some say we "halau" Pastor !!!! Some say it's not entirely our wrong !!!!(Just some conflict Pastor can't handle !!!!)  For me ( i was there that day ) it's misunderstanding that spark the flame !!!  Let's forget it "if we can" and learn from it !!!  Look at 3 of our "most wanted" weaknesses 1) not punctual = late 2) come empty handed = without notes even some without bible 3) low attendance = very very low (maybe low tide) others are the worship .... etc....  Hoping to see everyone in the coming youth meeting Maybe without the usual Pastor Tamil but i got latest news that negotiation is going on .....  Bye C ya

      Dear Youths Of BMBC,  It's been GREAT growing up and learning from all of you... I truly appreciate all the good times and bad times we have all gone through together as BMBC Youths. No matter what happens we know that God will always deliver us through each hurdle in our lives... The times that we have spent and shared, I will cherish it... Thank you all and may God bless all of you in everything that you do.  Until the time we meet again, I'll do my best to keep you all updated and in touch with me while I'm in Kuala Lumpur pursuing my studies and my dream. I'm going to miss all of you and the whole congregation of BMBC as a whole.   Take care and remember to "Puji Tuhan" always!!!  Bye for now.

      WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?  Love. Forgiveness. Mercy. Grace. Goodness. Compassion. Kindness. Generosity.  Who in the world would be against these characteristics? Who could oppose such positive forces in a person's life? In other words, who could call Christians nasty names, consider them dangerous, and seek to put as much distance as possible between themselves and Christians?  Who? Many people. But why? It's because in the Christians they already know, they do not observe love, forgiveness, compassion, goodness, kindness, mercy, grace, and generosity.  They won't see Christ and His attributes if we're standing in the way. If we have a self-serving agenda or cause, they'll see our hate instead of our love, our grudges instead of our forgiveness, our indifference instead of our compassion, our harshness instead of our goodness. Our lives need to be consistent with the message we proclaim.  Christianity is about Christ and His loving, forgiving, and compassionate gift of eternal life. Anything we do that reflects something else gives others the wrong idea.  It's all about Jesus. Let Him shine through your life so that others can see Him. Show me the way, Lord, let my light shine As an example of good to mankind; Helps them to see the patterns of Thee, Shining in beauty, lived out in me.  Live So That Others Will Want To Know Our Savior.

      I read the mail that Anonymous sent, and I've something to say.    Well,I have a few comments for the BMBC youth !! I wonder how pastors have this church halau.I think it would set a new record in The Malaysia Book of Records. It's kinda terrible how you ppl treat pastors. If you ppl do not like how the way pastors preach, I guess you're to stuck up to admit your mistakes.And the worshippers or musicians who were ambarassed by Ps.Tamil , i think they should brush up on their musical skills if they wouldn't want to look like real idiots again.  Well, i guess there's nothing more to say accept halau-ing pastors are very wrong and very rude.Especially saying they suck.If you're that clever, why don't you try going up yourself and preach a message as bitingly good as theirs!!!!  So there!!!!    First of all, whoever you are, I hope you're reading this. I appreciate your concern for the youth group, and with you wanting to tell us what you think about the youth group is good, but please, if you want to do so, do it by also including your name, and your info. No, you cannot just send comments from your side of view/story and not allow us to defend ourselves and enlighten you with our side of the story. Don't you think you're being unfair? Like a kid who refuses to listen to anyone, stubborn & stone-hearted, not willing to listen to others.   Quote:  I wonder how pastors have this church halau.I think it would set a new record in The Malaysia Book of Records.    From that sentence, you don't seem to be one of the youths. Not someone who belongs to the church. If not, wouldn't you have known if there was a case of "halau-ing pastor" as you call it? But anyway, let me tell you, I've been in BMBC all my life, and NO, we've not chased any pastors away before. Don't be silly, our pastors are voted, discussed, put on probation before hiring, if we didn't like them, we can just NOT vote for them. Oh, you think it'll set a new record in The Malaysia Book of Records? Then I think you can also join their "list-of-cowards" for not having the courage to even tell us your name. Anonymous? HAH!   Quote:  It's kinda terrible how you ppl treat pastors. If you ppl do not like how the way pastors preach, I guess you're to stuck up to admit your mistakes.   Please, enlighten us. How do we treat pastors? You said pastors, plural. So it means we treat pastors terribly. If you have the guts, name the pastors and tell me how badly we treat them. Thanks. So, if WE don't like the way pastors preach, it means we're too stuck-up to admit our mistakes? Ah, what a nice definition. I wonder who taught you that? God? Are you saying that pastors don't make mistakes? Pastors are holy & righteous that they don't make mistakes? Let me tell you something. Nobody is perfect, and yes, pastors are not perfect either. Different pastors have different ways of preaching and YES, sometimes the way they preach just doesn't suit us, so we tend to dislike the pastor. It doesn't mean that we don't admit mistakes. I've met so many pastors & I've heard many of them speak, tell me why do I love some of them so much? It's just the difference of mankind. Don't be unreasonable.   Quote:  And the worshippers or musicians who were ambarassed by Ps.Tamil , i think they should brush up on their musical skills if they wouldn't want to look like real idiots again.   I agree with Philip on this. Why must we, avoid looking like real idiots, just because you say so, or Pastor Tamil says so? It doesn't matter how good we are, or how terrible we are. We are singing praises to our Lord, and that's all it matters. Our focus is God, not pleasing the audience. It doesn't matter if BMBC Youth are playing, or Altered Frequency, or Planet Shakers or Hillsongs. The one and only reason is to worship God. If God is unhappy with the worship, let Him deal with us. Who are you to say anything? If you don't like it, why don't you come and lead worship someday? I'll be glad to give you a chance. Just let me know.   Quote:  Well, i guess there's nothing more to say accept halau-ing pastors are very wrong and very rude.   I totally agree. But who are you talking about? As far as I'm concerned, the youths of BMBC did not chase away Pastor Tamil. No, we didn't hold brooms & asked him to go away. No, we didn't say we didn't want him to come to our meets anymore. We did no such thing. Get your facts straight. Who said we HALAU-ED pastor?   Quote:  Especially saying they suck.    That was a mistake. He apologized, didn't he? The Bible teaches us to be forgiving, right? So what are you doing now? Keeping a grudge?   Quote:  If you're that clever, why don't you try going up yourself and preach a message as bitingly good as theirs!!!!   Once again, you're using plural. Who are THEY? Well, YOU think it's bitingly good. I don't. Sue me for having a different opinion. You're talking as if we can't have different views about other people. Are you just being totally unreasonable or are you trying to be God?   Yup. That's my opinion. Don't like it? Well, I don't care. Come talk to me face-to-face if you have the guts, and we'll talk it out. I'm Radiance Leong, in case you don't know. I'm the Youth Leader of the youth group, you have probs with us? Come talk to me. I'm always open for opinions. -peace- God bless!

Can u please deal directly with Sir "Chief" Morgan , he's the "Chief" so u should tell him so that he can address to us about your comments !!! By hook or by crook , we are still One In Christ (OIC) !!! Once again "Walk the Talk"  Pls note, i'm Keston a.k.a. "z.OR.ro_VIR.a.GO" at least i'm not someone "Anonymous" my viewpoints are mine and only my own viewpoints !!!

       Here's what I got from an e-mail... was meant to be a comment to one of the postings of BMBC's Youth.    Well,I have a few comments for the BMBC youth !! I wonder how pastors have this church halau.I think it would set a new record in The Malaysia Book of Records. It's kinda terrible how you ppl treat pastors. If you ppl do not like how the way pastors preach, I guess you're to stuck up to admit your mistakes.And the worshippers or musicians who were ambarassed by Ps.Tamil , i think they should brush up on their musical skills if they wouldn't want to look like real idiots again. Well, i guess there's nothing more to say accept halau-ing pastors are very wrong and very rude.Especially saying they suck. If you're that clever, why don't you try going up yourself and preach a message as bitingly good as theirs!!!! So there!!!!    First off, I would like to thank "Anonymous poster" for his or her comments.  "I wonder how pastors have this church halau". Sorry, please rephrase.  "I think it would set a new record in The Malaysia Book of Records." Well, if you think so, then, go tell them to make this new category.  "It's kinda terrible how you ppl treat pastors." How do we treat them? I dunno myself. Tell me about it! Btw, do you come to the Youth Meets?  "I guess you're to stuck up to admit your mistakes" What mistakes? Tell us!  "And the worshippers or musicians who were ambarassed by Ps.Tamil , i think they should brush up on their musical skills if they wouldn't want to look like real idiots again." Its EMbarrased. My personal opinion, and I might be wrong is that BMBC's musical talents are the finest in Bukit Mertajam.. I couldn't wish for any better. And who are you to comment on the Youth's musical skills? This is worshipping God! If God is unpleased with our worship or musicians, let Him deal with it. You shut up.  "Well, i guess there's nothing more to say accept halau-ing pastors are very wrong and very rude" No doubt you're right here!  "Especially saying they suck" Well, I take that back. Sorry. Apparently, Malaysia is not a free world after all. No place to express one's personal opinion. Btw, the church hasn't pay me my RM 250 for bmbc.info and the hosting space.. Hmm.. Mr. Morgan?  "If you're that clever, why don't you try going up yourself and preach a message as bitingly good as theirs!!!!" I would. I really would. Never did anyone say that he/she is more clever than the pastor. But as human with senses, we know an [insert favourite adjective here] when we see one.  "So there!!!!" What's your point?  Oh, and anonymous, next time, when posting, at least include a contact number, name or e-mail address or at least a "nickname" so I can address you properly!  Its no point listing down all Ps. Tamil's weaknesses and our "beef" with this dude. For He is God's servant. So.. yes, you're right in stating that we need to respect him. Like I said earlier, sometimes, us DEMANDING youths need someone we can relate to. And if one or two have a problem with a particular "person", then, its an isolated case. If almost everyone have differences with an individual, then, I don't see any sin in evaluating and acting on this individual.  Good night =)

      Friday June 18 2004 Jit Sin teacher's day!  The highlight of the day is undoubtedly The Ever Ready Teachers versus The Kaki Bangkus Prefects in a entertaining high scoring match! The match was an one sided affair and the final score, an embarrassing 5-0 lose for the prefects! Even our own church leader Sir Ravi Samuel got into the act, scoring a brace and with his commanding defensive role,the students voted him the Man Of The Match. However there's no prize for the winner nor the Man of the Match.

      Church History By Ps. Tamil July17,2004  All through the years the church was persecuted but they were growing in number, in strength, in holiness and spirituality. Until AD64, an emperor by the name of Nero came into power in the Roman Empire. This man masterminded the persecution against Christian. He sat the city of Rome on fire and then blame it on the innocent Christian. * Software giant Nero got it’s logo and name from this incident! Then on, official persecution against the church broke out. Christian then became the enemy of the nation and they were to suffer all kinds of persecution.  Until AD324, Constantine came into power. “Tradition or belief” supposed that he had an encounter with God. * But the bible didn’t state anything alike. He was at the verge of losing a war when he saw a cross. *Because it’s tradition, when “things” passed down through the ages, common sense tells you to doubt it! So some dudes try to add some authenticity to it and say he saw two words which mean Christ. Miraculously Constantine’s army won the war. So after the war, he made Christianity legal and Christian started to return to the church.  Around AD392, Theodisius was in full control and he gave privileges to those out there, if and only if he or she is a Christian. Thus this brought in non-Christian as they too wanted to be privileged and not to be saved. Worst of all, they “naively” bring in all types of idols into the church……..  Ps Tamil also spoke about the papacy(pope), Lutheran, Ana Baptist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Anglican, Methodist, about the Pentecost and how the “tongue” came about through the century of recovering the truth and the primacy of the scripture restored!  Sorry! I cannot or should not continue further! Join us every Saturday, 8-9.30 pm at BM Baptist Church from 17 July to 21 Aug! If you really can’t attend those meetings, vcd(s) for every session is available at RM7 each. For enquiries, call: 04-3240307, 012-4142690.

      Well, I love Arsenal and France too( I hope France wins the Euro 2004 and Arsenal win the premier league) but I have to say that you are not being very fair to others(M.united supporters, Italy, and especially the big  amount of England supporters(not forgeting the Rooney mania going around now) and of course not forgetting our dear host Portugal eg.) But hey,it is your website and what I say does not matter. Anyway(to 'angkat' you a bit)  I agree that Arsenal is( not the best) BUT 'ONE OF THE BEST TEAMS IN EUROPE'(I did not say in the whole world because you must consider clubs like Boca Juniors, Corinthians, Sao Paulo etc.). However, France has 2 talented players. Zizou has recieved the player of the year award and he is the best player in the world. Henry had no choice but to come in second(He was just a few votes away) but he still recieved 3 awards which are(in case you have forgotten) PFA player of the year award, the Golden boot(highest scorer in England) and of course the most wanted Silver boot(highest scorer in Europe. Possibly in the whole world) and he should be proud of that. I'm glad that you are also an Arsenal and a Henry fan like me(I thought his 2nd goal against Swistzerland was fabulously magnificently fantastic. Reminds me of the ever wonderful Arsenal striker). In case you do not know, Arsenal has bought a new striker Robin Van Persie from Holland. He is 20 years old and has scored 30 goals in just 60 matches. Next seasons premiership would be exciting as well as entertaining with all the new players and managers. Well, I have to end here. Send my regards to all and see you soon.  P.s. There will be a concert on 3rd July and will be held in PRai Baptist church at 8p.m. HOpe to see you there. One more thing, pls tell Adele thet her e-mail is expired again. Need to forward her a few things.                            In christ                                 John

      Dude i'll eat my words! It's only their first loss in 2004! Most labelled it as a Greek fairytale or David and Goliath story I would say it's luck!!! I was "that damn lucky" too when i got an A for chinese in my PMR I hope luck will be on my side during SPM  Nevertheless, I took EST as a "cover up" for my chinese!

      England thought they won it in 90 minutes Portugal thought they won it in extra time Then it all came down to the penalty shootout! Beckham scores the rugby style! Then another Aston Villa Old Gun - Mr. Vassell miss a penalty And Ricardo finish the game off by scoring the winner !!  Bring it on Portugal! France is coming your way!

      Dude ! Caught up with the Euro fever or should i say ROONEY-MANIA ?? Haha The espn pundits commented that one thing Rooney does't have is good looks ( i guess Beckham will be quite happy with that ) For those guys(and gals) who support England, please pause for a moment and rethink !! Can a bunch of inexperience first-timers , one trendsetter and a Swiss steamroll England to success ?? Can they deliver under pressure from the media and the boo-ers Portugal fans ?? Joker! even Chris Colombus can't think of such a plot for a blockbuster megahit Hollywood movie! Man"O"Man believe me ! France will be the ultimate winner ! Think bout Henry, Pires, Zidane, Vieira ......... World Footballer Of The Year ! European Footballer Of The Year ! Golden Boot Winner ! ...... If there's one team on earth which is "invincible" (other than Arsenal) it's France ( which is mould out of Frenchmen and by Frenchmen) ! Without a doubt, I once again would like to emphasize that France and Arsenal are the best football teams around! God , let France and Arsenal dominate the football world! May your grace and loving kindness be with them and also with us always !!

      Friday June 18 2004 Jit Sin teacher's day!  The highlight of the day is undoubtedly The Ever Ready Teachers versus The Kaki Bangkus Prefects in a entertaining high scoring match! The match was an one sided affair and the final score, an embarrassing 5-0 lose for the prefects! Even our own church leader Sir Ravi Samuel got into the act, scoring a brace and with his commanding defensive role,the students voted him the Man Of The Match. However there's no prize for the winner nor the Man of the Match.

      Most importantly 2004 is my one and only make or break SPM year! Seniors say “if you doesn’t do well, there goes your future!” But who’s stupid enough to try it out Even a daring dude has a pee brain to filter that SPM is no joke! It’s “kick butt, take-no-prisoner” attitude in other words “Do or die” But I’m still relax, enjoying myself, typing this blog on the net rather than study! What’s wrong with me?

      2004 -> year of "all years" Euro 2004( I hope France win it with Henry bagging the golden boot) Malaysia Idol 1st season(may Malaysia produce less William(s) and more Aiken(s)) Thomas Cup(Malaysia flop again) Uber Cup(Needless to comment) Olympic Games(just wait and see) Elections (many many of them all over the world, but I rate India’s election as the best, as if I’m watching a movie with the exciting plots with trailers, dramas, what ever you ask for, they have it ) And many other “minor” events like BMBC youth having a pastor(which they already don’t have now and may have again) and still we are only mid-year and I bet there’s more to come!!!

      Airs every Wednesday amd Thursday night 12 midnight on 8TV Starring Jason Lo as host and other celebrities  Patrick Teo , i guess Malaysian know about him !! Last night as a guest star , he had a whale of a time with Jason First up, he says he is curious why Jason always have the same group of people in Starbuck Sunway watching Latte@8! Do Jason pays them to do so ?! Certainly no, Jason says that they are the most loyal fan of Latte@8 So they talk about some nasty "stuff" in the middle of the show one part was cut and when it resume, Jason was talking about "shuttlecock"!! Common sense tells you thats very darn dirty but acceptable in today's world! The show goes on and it's really fun watching Malaysian hosting this shows and best of all hosting them very truly deeply madly well Jason Lo is one of the rare breed of capable Malaysian to do this  Can't wait Malaysia Idol starting tonight 9.45pm 8TV I hope there will be more "Kelly Clarkson and Clay Aiken" than "Willian Hung" -> America Best Reject ?? Then who's Malaysia Best Reject ??

      Hi I'm Keston Chew Vern Jiet from BMBC youth. I'm glad God gave me the opportunity to log on the internet and share a few things with you. First and foremost, many will say it is untimely for me to comment on this topic, but i just want to clarify and make some "things" clear  I'll start off by sharing the whole incident that happen the night itself. At around 7.30pm, my mum fetch my bro and i to church. I was quite happy to be given the chance to play the guitar but no matter how hard i practice, i still can't get the tempo of play Jacob wanted me to play. So at around 7.50pm, Chun Keat and Chun Hean entered the church, i spotted Chun Keat first so i ask him to give me a hand while i proceed to play the drum! Pastor arrived exactly at 8pm. So Radiance "kick off" the worship by saying a short yet meaningful prayer. Man'O'man it didn't go as plan. Jacob's tempo beat on the piano just didn't match the guitar and the drum! And Radiance!!! She try to sing to the tune!!! that's all she could do!!! but to no avail and her tune didn't match Jacobs' either. We then make our way to the nursery room. Before going in, Pastor have a word with me, not bout the worship but bout Daniel and other university-bound youths! I politely told him i don't know anything! Inside the nursery, Pastor's first sentence if i'm not wrong is "Y is dere so few youths attending dis youth meetin? I remember dere r 2 bro and 1 sis, d last time i saw dem was a month ago!" I guess Pastor is talking bout the Thams and then Adele took out the attendance list and check for other absentees. Most have "valid" reason for not attending. E.g. Pip got to go for a wedding and so on. Then came the "Fan flaming the fire", Pastor wanted to continue his conflict topic but there is one very big problem - out of 10 youths only 2 brought their notes. Pastor then started to comment that our youths are not puncture for youth meeting and then he says "According to ....... , not puncture for meeting and not bringing notes means those offenders don't respect others and the youth group as a whole" He then added some other comments maybe because he wants to correct us. Then he said "Y u all come for meetin like'dat? Wastin time oni" That phrase set my bro "on fire" and he told pastor "If we continue like this and don't learn anything, it's really wasting our time. I'm here for only the second time(since Pastor took over) and wants to hear the good news!!" Pastor then answered "U don't tell me wat to do , are u sayin my papers are unprofitable?" (where did pastor got that from? No one said that) Kester replied that he is not saying the paper is unprofitable but Pastor kept insisting that me bro said it!! (Wat a conflict?! A big-time misunderstanding perharps) I just can't keep my big mouth shut and told Pastor what to do !!!! Ops!! I told Pastor to continue his conflict topic and today we'll discuss bout eschatology!! Pastor reluctantly discuss it but at least we learn something that day! Last few words from the Pastor is "When the church take sides(against Israel), remember this day i told you not to go against Israel" the then says this time will be his last time at BMBC!  witnesses ! if there is any wrong sequence or proceeding above , pls contact me 0125139020! Keston Chew Vern Jiet 871109-35-5467 BMBC youth (bmbc.info/youth)  one more thing, Mr/Mrs/Miss/Dr Anonymous, Pls reveal urself !!!!

      1. Women are unpredictable. Before marriage, she   expects a man, after marriage she suspects him, and after death she   respects him.     2. There was this guy who told his woman that he loved  her so much that he would go thru hell for her. They got married - and   now he is going thru hell.      3. A man inserted an 'ad' in the classifieds : "Wife   wanted ". Next day, he received a hundred letters. They all said the   same thing : "You can have mine."     4. When a man opens the door of his car for his wife,   you can be sure of one thing: either the car is new or the wife.     5. It's easy to tell if a man is married or not. Just   watch him drive a   car with a woman sitting beside him. If both his hands   are on the wheel, you can be sure he is married.     6. A man received a letter from some kidnappers. The   letter said, "If you don't promise to send us $100,000 I swear that we   will kidnap your wife." The poor man wrote back, " I am afraid I can't   keep my promise but I hope you will keep yours."     7. What's the matter, you look depressed." "I'm having   trouble with my wife." "What happened?" "She said she wasn't going to   speak to me for 30 days." "But that ought to make you happy." "It did,   but today is the last day."     WOMAN   When she is 18 - She is a football, 22 men going after   her. When she is 28 - She is a hockey ball, 8 men going after her. When   she is 38 - She is a golf ball, 1 man hitting on her. When she is 48 - She   is a pingpong ball, 2 men pushing to each other.      MAN   At 20 - A man is like a coconut, so much to offer, so little to give.   At 30 - He is like a durian, dangerous but delicious.   At 40 - He is like a watermelon, big, round and juicy.   At 50 - He is like a mandarin orange, the season comes once in a year.   At 60 - He is just like a raisin, dried out, wrinkles and cheap.      Marriage Humour In the beginning,      -- God created earth and rested. Then God created man  and rested. Then God created woman. Since then, neither God nor man has   rested.

            When I was 10, my prized possession was my football – I ate with it, slept with it and I polished it weekly … instead of my shoes. I knew about football – but on some other things, like where babies came from, I was a little hazy. 	One afternoon, I was playing in the street and I lost my precious ball. I looked everywhere. I figured someone had stolen it! 	Eventually I spotted a woman who seemed to be hiding it under her jacket. So I marched up and asked her: “What do you think you’re doing with my football stuck up your shirt?” 	It turned out that she didn’t have my football … but that afternoon I learned where babies came from – and what a woman looks like when she is 9 months pregnant. 	Later that day, I also found my ball. 	What fascinated me most of all, was why I had never noticed a pregnant woman before the age of 10 … and why, from then onward, I seemed to be surrounded by them!

      The 7 Ups!  1. Wake Up !!   Decide to have a good day. "This is the day the Lord hath made; let us rejoice and be glad in it." Psalms 118:24   2. Dress Up !!  The best way to dress up is to put on a smile. A smile is an inexpensive way to improve your looks. "The Lord does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart." I Samuel 16:7  3. Shut Up!!  Say nice things and learn to listen. God gave us two ears and one mouth, so He must have meant for us to do twice as much listening as talking.  "He who guards his lips guards his soul." Proverbs 13:3  4. Stand Up!!   . . . for what you believe in. Stand for something or you will fall for anything. "Let us not be weary in doing good; for at the proper time, we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good..." Galatians 6:9-10  5. Look Up !!  . . . to the Lord. "I can do everything through Christ who strengthens me". Philippians 4:13  6. Reach Up !!  . . . for something higher. "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not unto your own understanding. In all your ways, acknowledge Him, and He will direct your path." Proverbs 3:5-6   7. Lift Up !!  . . . your Prayers. "Do not worry about anything; instead PRAY ABOUT EVERYTHING." Philippians 4:6   A POSITIVE THOUGHT  If God had a refrigerator, your picture would be on it. If He had a wallet, your photo would be in it. He sends you flowers every spring, and a sunrise every morning.  Whenever you want to talk, He'll listen. He could live anywhere in the universe, and He chose your heart. What about the Christmas gift He sent you in Bethlehem; not to mention that Friday at Calvary. Face it, He's crazy about you.

      Malaysia semua babi,  our government is so lousy,  make the college becomes no quality,  Chinese and Indian pun tak boleh masuk university.  It never had a choice for me, because no money cannot study at oversea, so I always feel i'm so pity.   Every college are greedy, sini sana all need money, their pocket kosong our perut noisy, I am poor because there sucks my money.   Exam question full of difficulty, it has a reason only, which is to earn more money, because we retake money masuk lagi. The staffs always no aksi, they did wrong never say sorry, before asking please show your money, otherwise they wont be happy, we pay their salary still make us angry. that's why i wanna study hard to earn more and more money   Tiap-Tiap hari feel so lazy,  never try to wake up early, always hope college sekarang cuti,  everyday go to class feel so sleepy,  lecturer always scold me lazy.  do assignment just like to copy, before the final just feel worry, every nite study until crazy, because scared scold by mummy.   Why my class always no pretty, those elephant always show me how she's sexy, the monster wanna treat me nicely, like that i better mati.   my looking is **** ugly,  saya mari girl girl lari,  everyday date them they only say busy, semua orang tak ada hati, make me always so lonely,  only can watch porno movie.    CS always let people bully, maybe i am really so lousy, althought knife people is so happy, but i am always unlucky, kena headshot easily, after mati still mati.   This is just a small story,  typed it simply,  feel funny and happy,  actually i am not lonely, because I have many friends around me.

      Pesanan Penting  Menurut laporan Polis seorang wanita telah dirogol oleh 5 lelaki disebuah kelab malam di Singapura pada malam Sabtu sebelum ditinggalkan. Wanita tersebut tidak berupaya untuk mengingati kejadian malam tersebut, namun ujian mengesahkan bahawa beliau telah dirogol berulang kali dengan kesan rohypnol di dalam darahnya dan progestrex, sejenis pil "mencuci" yang kecil. Dadah tersebut kini digunakan oleh perogol-perogol dan kemudian "mencuci" mereka. Progesterex dibekalkan kepada para Doktor haiwan untuk"mencuci"haiwan besar. Khabarnya Progesterex digunakan bersama Rohypnol, sebagai dadah "Dating" dan rogol. Apa yang mereka perlu lakukan ialah menitiskan Rohypnol ke dalam minuman si gadis, mangsa tersebut tidak akan ingat apa-apa pun esok paginya, apa yang berlaku kepadanya sepanjang malam tersebut. Progesterex amat senang larut dalam minuman, akan "mencuci" agar simangsa tidak akan mengandung akibat dari perkosaan tersebut dan siperogol tidak bimbang untuk perlu menjalani ujian air mani dan DNA kemudian. Kesan dadah ini adalah K*E*K*A*L terhadap si mangsa. Prodesterex asalnya adalah untuk memandulkan kuda, Mana-mana wanita yang mengambilnya TIDAK AKAN MENGANDUNG SAMPAI BILA-BILA. Si durjana boleh memperolehi dadah ini boleh mendapatkan dadah ini dari pusat haiwan atau mana-mana universiti, dan ia diramalkan akan digunakan dengan berleluasa di kampus-kampus.  Tolong edarkan maklumat ini kepada semua yang anda kenali, terutama teman wanita dan gadis remaja. Berwaspada apabila anda keluar, jangan biarkan minuman anda terbiar tanpa dijaga oleh orang yang anda percayai.     Azila Bakri, Social Worker,  All Women's Action Society (AWAM)
