      Sorry I haven't updated in a while now. I've been kinda busy.  I haven't got too much to say, excep my sister was in a School "Wizard of Oz" play. It wasn't a crappy Primary school one, it was a really good High School one. Dorothy was a Grade 11 student, The Lion, Tin Man and Scarecrow were Grade 12, the munchkins and Jitterbugs were all Grade 8 (with some exceptions), my sis is Grade 8.  Dorothy *drools over dorothy* =I   It was Kate's Birthday on the 29th f may (Yes, 4 days after mine) so I was going to go to the movies with her, Lukas and Rowan, but she couldn't come so I went to see Troy with Lukas,Sis and Rowan instead  Anyone who doesn't have a blog, get one now.   urlLink Here   See Ya then

      Man...I really am the dumbest person in the whole world. I went to see 'The Day After Tomorrow' at the movies (very good, has to be seen on large screen!), but I decided to take the following with me for no reason:  -   Customise Grip w/ rubber thing + G-Winder -   Gaia Dragoon MS  So guess what?  (a)   I lost it... (b)   I lost it because I had piss! (c)   I lost it becuase I'm a god damn idiot!  Correct answer  ...(C)!   So, i am having thoughts about taking a break from blading, my desision isn't final, so I'll keep you posted...BTW, if i do...it wont be for long, just until i decide what to do next.  Untill my next post...toodles

      I must say, that whilst Wolborg MS is now officially my favorite beyblade, I am dissapointed. The tip already has small cracks in it. I'm trying to get the New LimtedBlack Version, hopefully it's more durable.
