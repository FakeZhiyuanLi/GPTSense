      I was going to continue with my Maui trip but have decided to drop that due to the lack of interest that I have in repeating a trip that I spent mostly reading and lounging by the pool.  In less that six days I leave for four weeks to go to Camp Stewart.  An all boys camp (hell on Earth...) with little to no contact with the outside world.  One plus being that there are few worries other than what type of hellish food they are going to serve.  Truth be told it isn't all that bad, I lose alot of weight every year.  Anyway, if things go the way I forsee, I won't have access to a computer for at least four weeks and after I get back, I will probably have forgotten this so don't be too upset, Liz.  And what's this about Dallas?  Oh and where are you goin to college? Curiosity killed the teen. Hopefully I won't have to mow tomorrow due to the flood that is going to wipe out central Texas.  I do love rain and storms and what not.  Storms are particularily fun at camp because there is nothing to do but sit inside cabins where there is no air-conditioning and no glass windows so the cool air from the rain just sweeps through and makes it very very nice, least to me.  It always seems so relaxing to listen to the rain and then sometimes its so invigorating. How can you like Bobby Bones?  I don't understand you, course, who can? Ok, I'm done thinking, I'm going to go and soak my mind in at least an hour of strategic warfare. HELLO WORLD!

      Hey to all my faithful readers, Liz. Only four guys asked you to marry you? Whats wrong with these guys? Hope you laughing at that. My trip was great, my grandmother took me and that was a pain but other than her it was fabulous.  We stayed at the Fairmont Kea Lani, Kea Lani means heavenly white, and it was really nice.  Instead of just having a room, each room is a suite.  Thats all they have is suites, which is nice.  And the rooms aren't that expensive, except the full ocean views which are like double the normal but still.  Only an arm and a leg.  Any way, we went on a helicopter tour for an hour and I bought the DVD that you can get of your specific flight.  I have yet to go and see it but it should be alot of fun and the scenery is really nice. We had a luau on Tuesday, which was overly commercialized and not as good as the other one we saw by chance but it was still fun.  Wednesday we went on a tour van in a limo van, no not a stretch limo van but a normal van with captain seats in it and fancy woodwork.  That took us on, big dramatic pause, large booming voice saying " THE ROAD TO HANA"!  This road was really curvey, 617 curves, and it took about 5 hours to go 30 miles.  Awesome scenery, waterfalls on the right, ocean and cliffs and beaches on the left, hairpin curves, flowers, it was great.  We had a little adventure also but that will be in the next post along with my summation.  This is simply too much typing, I'm gonna stop and see what Liz posts. Still waiting to see if anyone else is reading this...

      I always did like that song. I got a comment!  Probably cause she's the only one that reads this.  Oh well, its kinda fun and it gives me something to do other than just sit at night.  I wonder which is better, Greece or Maui....hmmm...I think Maui.  Hahaha!  Sorry had to do that.  Its a shame Liz won't be at HP next year.  So sad that there won't be ne one above us to complain about, other than the administration, but everyone complains about them so they don't count.  Ok, I typed that sentence like five times just now so i better stop before i type this one over and over again. I'm gonna get leid! HAHA!

      I'm goin to Maui! Ok so its with my grandmother fine.  Still it hopefully won't be as bad as DC was.  Don't ask me why I am typing this all up, oh thats right cause no one will really read it Wonder what would happen if I put my social security number on this. oh well, i guess it will be yet another site that simply fades into nothingness like so many other sites on the world wide web.

      Well, hello world. Maybe this will work out, my last attempt certainly didn't. For starters, I need to figure out how to edit my profile. So if I do figure it out, take a look to see just who I am, if you don't already know who I am. TrueDiva, you started this in me so this is your fault if this is terrible. Comprende, ese? LoL-oh well, um...lets see...where was I going with this, oh yes...no...I have no clue...what exactly do other people put in their blogs?  If anyone actually reads this let me know. Oh, and if you are interested in talking straight to me, try my AIM screen name - EnteDunkle That is, if i am ever on, but good luck any way. TrueDiva, give me a post.

      Hey Liz, my true reader. Got back from Camp Stewart on Friday, still trying to readjust myself to home life after spending four weeks with 270 other boys! Very hard to do. Don't worry, they're all too young for you so you didn't miss out on anything. Hows Dallas, or was it Fort Worth>? I can't remember forgive me. HP starts back up on the 16th joy oh joy i have to go in tomorrow to get my schedule fixed since they screwed it up as usual oh well i should be happy i am bored, i just wish it wasn't during the summer, my true FREE time oh well write more later and u tell me to update?
