       Wow. The only word I can say. Dan's website,  urlLink Simplebits , has everything I, as a wanna-be designer, to learn and prosper from. At my first glance around his website I thought he was just a GFX artist spicing up the web, but a closer look revealed his undieing commitment to web standards. Truely, I will have to add him to my daily reads.    As for any newbies out there, or folks- like me- who are not so well founded in web standards as others, Dan has a little Quiz with moderated discussion which he began last year. The  urlLink SimpleQuiz , I believe is an on going documented question and answer series ranging from the simple header questions to more complex questions such as... Aw shucks, I ain't no judge at complex issues, that's the point of this blog, so waste ye little time and fly! Fly! Fly!

       Arg. I really dislike using other people's templates when I can make a perfectly fine  urlLink Blogger  template myself. So now I am using  urlLink Dan Cederholm  template- he also has some good reads.    Planning on getting my own template made by next month, but with all the things going on it just keeps getting harder and harder to get things done around this materialized thing called "life".

       I'm sorry folks, but the truth still remains, I'm not a person to be held accountable for keeping a blog around for long. This is- not including my blog/websites- probably the 15th or 20th blog I've started. However, unlike all the previous weblogs, I have began a mission to soak up all the info I can on web design and programming through other people's blogs.        urlLink Authentic Boredom  by Cameron Moll      urlLink A List Apart  by various authors      urlLink Youngpup  by Aaron Boodman    Although those are just three that I have frequently read over the past weeks, there are many more, but for now the main purpose of this post is to inform you on what will be coming- and see this template by  urlLink Jeffrey Zeldman  that is default until I get my act together with a school project and friend's band website.     A Purpose, A Goal, A Passions   (I hope)   For now the main intent of this blog is to track my trail as I begin my road to predition- er, excuse me- full fledged web designer and web programmer. The programing idea seems to fit my mathmatical talent more; yet I have failed to initiate a step by step process to learn a language. The web design side of things apeases my eyes more, but I am no artist, yet I still try and come up short miserably.    No worries, as a camp counsouler once said, "You'll bounce back!" And indeed I have! Once I finish the touches on my school's website and get rolling back in school within the next month, I'll take to an independant class solely focused on Javascript. From there I plan on presuing PHP and dive into some hefty reading on web design.    Until I return from vacation- to all a goodnight and to all a good blessing.

       A man went to a barbershop to have his hair cut and his beard trimmed. As the barber began to work, they began to have a good conversation. They talked about so many things and various subjects.  When they eventually touched on the subject of God, the barber stated his disbelief in God, "I don't believe that God exists."  "Why do you say that?" asked the customer.  "Well, you just have to go out in the street to realize that God doesn't exist. Tell me, if God exists, would there be so many sick people? Would there be abandoned children? If God existed, there would be neither suffering nor pain. I can't imagine a loving a God who would allow all of these things."  The customer thought for a moment, but didn't respond because he didn't want to start an argument. The barber finished his job and the customer left the shop. Just after he left the barbershop, he saw a man in the street with long, stringy, dirty hair and an untrimmed beard. He looked dirty and unkempt.  The customer turned back and entered the barber shop again and he said to the barber: "You know what? Barbers do not exist."  "How can you say that?" asked the surprised barber. "I am here, and I am a barber. And I just worked on you!"  "No!" the customer exclaimed. "Barbers don't exist because if they did, there would be no people with dirty long hair and untrimmed beards, like that man outside."  "Ah, but barbers DO exist! What happens, is people do not come to me."  Exactly!

       About two weeks ago while on the way to Kentucky Lake, my family and I were enjoying a long car ride across Ohio. At the time everything was going fine- fading in out of a conscience state of mind while listening to Rammstein. Then out of the blue it happened, something I expected, but did not really expect.  A little silver car comes up behind our Econoline van and honks. My dad, being friendly and all rolls down the window to see what the fellows in the car wanted. What they wanted we couldn't help them with; in fact, I would be appauled to even think about such things.  "F Bush!"  That's what they said folks. Four male college boys out for a cruise down the interstate, and instead of making their rounds at the local bars and checking out the ladies- the natural thing to do- they wanted to get it on with the President of the United States of America- a male mind you. However, I doubt the secret service would let them near Dubya.  Humph. It's just like liberals to change their minds. They always said Kerry looked nicer, why not get it on with him?  Politics confuse me.

       I'm seventeen, so most of my friends are recieving their driving permits and driving liscenses by now. However the lucky few have managed to get a car, but that is beside the point.  With a car and a liscense, you can pick up more chicks (girls), act out, and not get caught by your parents. By acting out I mean the basics- sitting back in your seat in order to obscure your visual view of the road, cranking up the music so you can't hear the nasty insaults from the on coming traffic, and reving the engine as you pull into people's driveways.  Cool, eh?  Yea dawg.  Guess what? I can do the same things on my tractor, excluding the music. Yet people would think I was nuts. And there in lies the absolute fact that cool is relative to the situation.
