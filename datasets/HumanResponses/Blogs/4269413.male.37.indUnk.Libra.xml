      Okay, I will admit it.  I am very tired of hearing this back and forth regarding John Kerry's record in Viet Nam, and how these "Swift Veterans for Truth" are being no blatently used by the Republican campaign to elect Bush ( remember that he was SELECTED in 2000) .  I'm simply astounded that they are so ready to attack John Kerry's record, when their candidate can't even claim his 'service' in the Texas Air National Guard is on an equal playing field. So rather than doing what Senator McCain ( a legitimate Veteran POW and a fine banner carrier for the GOP in his own right) suggested, they continue to refuse to repudiate such an un-American attack, and claim that all the 523's should stop their messages.  Gimme a break!

      As first posted at Volhouse.com...  I think College Football News is pretty accurate at guessing 10-1 for the Vols, with the toughest test coming between the hedges. Me, I'm going to predict a little bit lower, 9-2.  I'm optimistic that Fulmer is rather hacked off at the world these days, and that could be a big plus for a program that while still successful, has lost a little bit of luster from those heady days of 1998.  This feels like a 1994 situation all over again - the names have changed, but I can see one of these young QB's making a name for himself in Knoxville. Certainly the opportunity is there - Fulmer is not sold on ANYBODY yet, so while Leak will likely start against UNLV, if he doesn't immediately catch fire, look for Fulmer to start playing his other choices for some game time experience. I think that Chavis' defense will be essential to having a good season this year, so it's going to be up to 'CHIEF' and his tribe of Orange clad warriors to fend off the opposing offenses.  I have a bad feeling about Florida this year - it would be a mighty big feather in their cap to win in Knoxville again, and the Vols are going to get them pretty early without much of an opportunity to gel. The best the Gators should hope for right now is a fast start out of the gate that quiets down the crowd at Neyland, and frustrate the pee-doodle outta Sanders and his offense. If the Vols can come out popping on all cylinders at home, it could be a long evening for the boys from F-l-o-r-i-d-a.  Georgia I expect will be a sour note - I've said previously that the best Fulmer and Co. can hope for is a real hard battle between UGA and LSU, with plenty of banged up dawgs out for a game or so. The Vols are gonna need alot of breaks to win that game, I expect. If I had to pick a loss this upcoming season, this would be the one - UGA is good.  Auburn should be another fierce game, but I'm excited about this brief return to the rivalry of old. I think that the Vols will be eager for some payback after last year, and this one has the potential of being a real barn-burner ( no pun intended.) Pretty evenly matched if you ask me, but I think the Vols will squeak by in this one.  Alabama. Just the mere word brings up emotions in Tennessee fans. We all want to see the Vols throttle the Tide from one end to the other. It's war every time the Crimson and Orange meet, but with all the other stuff going on, this year's event should be quite an event. A win would pull the Vols ever closer to the magical number of taking over the lead in the series - something that would irk Bama fans to no end. Is this Coach Shula able to stop the Vols march to taking over that series lead? Stay tuned...  Ole Miss worries me, especially on the road - the Vols haven't had to cope with playing against someone who knows them as well as David Cutcliffe. I expect this one will be tougher than expected, but the Vols should win if they don't shoot themselves in the foot too many times.  South Carolina - on the road again. I think this will be Lou's swansong, so this could be tougher than expected. This is one Halloween scare we DON'T need.  Notre Dame - I have a feeling this could be a tough one - The Irish still recruit some of the finest players in the country, so this is not a game to chalk up as a win prematurely, no matter the record.  UNLV, UK, LA Tech and Vandy should all be relatively safe bets for marks in the win column, but Fulmer and the Vols would be unwise to take any of them too lightly. One at a time, folks.

      I participate in a sports board (which shall remain nameless, but it's a Tennessee board, since I AM a Tennessee Volunqueer!)   As you can imagine, the majority of posters there are what I would call 'good people if they weren't such brain-washed conservative fundamentalists."  They drive me nuts at times, and often I find myself a lonely voice of reason among a chorus of "the bible tells me so."  Okay, I really try to be a 'live and let live' kinda guy, and they are welcome to their religious traditions. It's an American tradition for most people to have  a religious or spiritual belief system and engage in it as they please, or to refrain from participation in religion.  The problem is that we are living in a time now where religion has become a factor in defining public policy, and in a very public way.  It's almost like having a "Jesus filter" on everything!  To my knowledge, it's been acceptable in American life to profess a belief in God, without bringing in the evangelical factor as we now see in the Bush Administration.  I know I certainly prefer a "keep it to yourself" approach to religion.  Determining public policy should not be slanted by any specific set of religious tenets, but should be determined by the greater common good.  So, I've been arguing back and forth that the measures taken by the government to deny equality in marriage rights as pushed by the Republican party in power is unacceptable to me. They have been unable to articulate a defendable position defining exactly how heterosexual marriage is injured by gay marriage, other than to toss up ridiculous notions such as "it's against God's will" or other definition of Sin. Another argument is that "marriage is for pro-creation" but then they are unable to understand how that argument is refuted by childless heterosexual couples being married.  In other words, it's an exclusive right to straights that they refuse to share with gay and lesbian citizens that want the benefits and rights accorded by the government.  No matter how it's phrased to them that gay marriage is a CIVIL function and their religious institution would never be required to perform gay marriages or accept them, they are determined to restrict marriage to straight couples only.  I'm encouraged that John Kerry is accepting of Civil Unions, and that would be acceptable if all benefits accorded to straight marriages are equivalent, but I am quite bluntly skeptical of straight politicians altogether.

      Hello - this is my first post from the "Peoples Republic of Takoma Park", or "Tacky Park" as I like to call it.  Great little progressive town, very gay friendly ( important!) and certainly a place I like to call home. I'm originally from Knoxville, Tennessee - still a loyal Volfan but glad I escaped the Bible Belt. It's a good place to be from - operative word "FROM."  I am going to do what everyone else is doing these days - posting an opinion on whatever crosses my mind in reaction to the news of the day.  Today's topic, since it's my first post, is the US Economy.  An Economic slow-down was beginning about the time that George Dubya stole the election, and one of the factors was the uneasiness of the end of the Clinton Administration. How sharp a turn would a Republican Adminstration make?  As we have seen, the distribution of wealth in the US has widened between the "haves" and the "have-nots," and as long as the Republican Trifecta remains, not much will change.  Granted, the economic plunge post 9/11 is not entirely the Bush Administration's fault - I don't believe that they knew it was coming with 100% accuracy, but they certainly didn't pay enough attention to the threat. Over the past several years, the danger from the previous attack on the WTC Towers in the early 90's, the bombings of embassies in Africa, the USS Cole all would seem to indicate that the world was not a friendly place for Americans. The intelligence failures are partially to blame on a Republican controlled Congress - the Congress ALWAYS holds the purse strings, regardless of who controls the White House.  I have yet to hear "Who cut the budget for the intelligence services, and why?" asked of the Congress.  Seems to me that various people in the government today are too busy pointing the finger at someone else, rather than standing up and saying "We made a mistake - here's what we are doing to make sure we don't do it again."
