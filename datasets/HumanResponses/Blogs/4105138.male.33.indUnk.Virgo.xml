      Weve got a new memeber on the WLSinfo trek possy :)  julie has kindly volanteered to help us get organised. and this evening after a meeting with me ken and dave , shes alreddy on the case drawing up a plan of action for us which is very cool :) , a few points on there we need to discuss but in general all  looking very promosing.  we have the latest version o fthe website up too so toms blog now has a link :) and teh paypal button is working so if you fancy giving us a donation it would be much apreciated , pop over to  urlLink www.wlstrek.co.uk  and have a look :)  im not long back indoors, me and dave have been out watching the perseid  metior shower. quite spectacular but the cloud closed in grumble grumble  I need to get me finger out here and get hold of the walk maps so i can start doing a detaield plan :) together and sorting out overnight stops and stuff.  theres a frightening amount of work to do but its great that we have another set of hands now :)

      sorry i didnt get a chance post yesterday . Tom my conutter was haveing all sorts of problems with his partner so i was doing providing  a frendly sholder for hiom most of the evening . I think they have things sorted now so all ended well.      I had an apoinent with the diatcian yesterday :) youll like this.  Im trying to sort out an apointment to have my gastric band tightend a lttle as im still eating way to much and although im not puting on weight  my weight loss has ground to a hault. unfortunatley thats not prooving  easy as the hospital and in particular prof baxter team are very streached and ive been waiting since the begining of july to see someone about it . so after me phoning up loads of times and doing the pestering patient bit i finally get to see the diatician. after a good long natter it turns out that im eating all the right stuff at teh tight times just eating to mutch  NO SHIT SHERLOCK !!!!!! thats why i had the band in the first place and why i was trying to get it tightend a little. gesss what :)   the diativcian dosent now hoew i go about gettign my band tightend eather aaarrrrrrrrrggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  oh well shes going to call prof baxters team for me and ill chase them up tomorow too hey ho :)  we had a bit of a rethink with the website and weve asked ken to help. if you have seen the memborship page on the WLS info site thats pretty much exactly what were looking for , for the dsonation page, so ive asked ken if the chappy who designed that page might be able to design a similar one for us to add to the wlsinfo trek sight :)  right beter dash of as i have a friend ocming over shortly  and i need to get the house loking semirespectable LOL ttfn

      Hi everyboddy ,                              Toms got his blog up have a look at  urlLink http://tomstrek.blogspot.com/  he he its all coming together rathr nicely. ken has been talking to a publacist chappy whos going to help us plug the event like mad and juie one of the mods from the WLSinfo sute is going to comre along and whip us all into shape on thursday, just as well really cause we need organising badly LOL  The next update to the website is almost reddy to go up, just waiting on ken tosend us the code for the paypal button and were away. we did hit on a snag there , we didnt no how to recoerd when people were makeing a donation. WLSinfo would recieve the money but would have no record of where it came from  so we have put a form up there . for people to fill in before they make a donation that way we no who to say thankyou too and can keep a runing total. its a little clumbsey but hopefully should work, people fill in the form then click submit, and then  eather click on the cheq or credit card button :)  should work until i can work out something better.  as for the barnie, well im a bear and ken was asking me the other day what a bear was :) well after reading through another blog  urlLink call center confidential  hehe well i m another barnie lol and spookely enough lol i work in a call center too :)  bye for now guys

      he he got a bit caried away last night :)  me and my co trek nutter tom decided last night we'd it down and work out a list of equipment we would need for the walking part of the trek . several coffes and hours later we find out its now 8am and weve been up all night oh dear LOL not to wory nether of us had work today so nop problems there .  We're going to change the name of the trek to the wls info trek to have some continutiy with the wls info site, a very good idea that ken  pointed out to us :) thanks for that matey and were haveing a rethink on the logo to make it more printer friendly .  another thing we need to do is have a chat with ken about one of the pages too. tehhow can you help one, im thuinking it might be a good idea to put 2 forms on theere one where people can donate directly to the charity via pay pal and another where people can print out a form and post it in to us with a cheq.  also may be a downloadablwe sponsor form, but im not to sure about that one  it might be open to abuse.  soon as all thats sorted well get the website live. and once thats up the leter wrighting can begin  how am i today TIRED LOL !!!

Big thanks to ken for all the help and suport he's given us not least in setting up these bloggs for us , ken you are an absolute star matey .  Theres so much stuff to do over the next nine months at the moment its all seeming a little daunting but we are gettign there and getting a game plan organised. The website is almost complete and once it has the ok from ken and the other wls guys it will go live at  urlLink www.wlstrek.co.uk  Huge thanks to Dave my other half for that , when it comes to web design hes second to none :).  After a good deal of debating we decided it would be beter to cycle from lands end to john o groats insted of the other way round its not such a harsh start going that way , hehe it meens we dont have a 1000ft clime on day one (phewwwwwwww) :)  Im waiting on maps ariving , but i have the iocknield way section broken down into 7 ,1 day sections, just waiting on the angles way , ridge way , wessex ridgeway and southwest costal paths to arive and ill get craking on them :)  Ill get all the routs posted in detail on the web site as soon as poss, then its time for me to start wrighting letters asking for suport from companies and celebs, and seeing if any one will donate stuff for the charity auction , if you no of any one who could help please email in to let us no or point them at the website once it goes live , thanks guys . Infact if youd like to help ,or if you fancy joining us for part of the trek or indeed all of it we would love to have you come join us , even if its just to cheer us on , wright a few letters or run about with a sponser form :) . just send in an email to let us no :)  How am i feeling at the moment he he half excited about this and half a litle daunted by it all (the walk and teh cycle are the least scarey parts LOL ) but as i say not in a bad way , ive got great people on board helping, were a wls trek team and a flipping good one at that he he we are off with a vengance and i for one cant wait :) big hugz guys charlie
