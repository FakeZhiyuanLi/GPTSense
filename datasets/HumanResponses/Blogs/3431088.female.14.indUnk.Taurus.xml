      Look everybody! its green! just like pistachios, and cranium pieces, and grass, and peanut m&ms, and my tshirt... green is a great color! (haha mike, adam, jason, Gillian, and Wes)! I really like this blogspotter thing. It coo... So this is what happened to me this weekend.... Friday: ADAMS HOUSE!!!!!!!! oh yeah, wesley and I are awsome at pretending we know how to play the guitar... and Mike, Jason, and Adam are good at actually knowing how to play the guitar. So, by reading that, you may have guessed I went to Adams house with Mike, Jason, Adam (of course), Wesley and Gillian. The funny thing is, I was supposed to go to Wesleys house, but I got home and Gilly called from Adams, so I went over there, and then we called Wes, and then she came. So we messed around all afternoon, and we discovered that I have a stange, undeniable, unexplainable obsession with the color Green, I would be holding something, and just say to myself "Oh cool, its green" and then everyone would laugh at me... but I laughed to, so it ayighte. Then we went to WALGREENS!!!!!!! and Gillian bought 24 Airheads, even though Mrs. Raveret had about the same number at home... then while we were there, Mike sprayed himself with AXE, so then Gillian and I kept smelling his stomach.. now let me quote Gillian "mike, your shirt smells good, can I have it". Oh good times, good times. But the Gillian left, and we couldnt decide what to do, so we played Lacross across the street, and we got stopped by a cop, and he asked us if we had seen a white convertible, and we said "why", and he said "because we believe that they have either a long riffle, or a bb gun", so then I ran back to adams house. Then we decided to have brownies, and Im sorry I slapped you so hard MIKE! but then, we decided to go to Michaels for dinner, then we came back, and failed at an attempt to play Twister, but then we played Cranium, and I got the green piece! WOOT! but then we all went home. Saturday: I GOT MY GRADUATION DRESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! yay!!!!!!!!!!!!!! then I came home, had a craving for chips, and we didnt have any chips, so Im eating them now.... Sunday: I made this thing! yay! and I watched "Cheaper by the Dozen". Then I came online, talked to mike... and later I am going to take a shower and get ready for my "Song of fecking dupage" concert.. its really "Song of dupage", but who cares... its my chorus spring concert... yay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ok, I have to go now! bye! luv ya! leave a post!
