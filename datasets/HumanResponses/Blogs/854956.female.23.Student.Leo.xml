      I don't understand why we can't make school only occur on the weekends.  This would be so much more convenient for me, aside from the fact that it'd take me about 20 years to finish school.  This semester is ALREADY getting to me.  I have a project due in my Masterpieces of Music class, and this would be an easy project, except it's to interview a professional musician.  And the musician I was going to interview is out of town.  GREAT!  Anyway, everything else is going good.  I got a B on my first psychology exam.  This I am upset about.  However, in retrospect, I did good considering the majority of the test was extremely hard.  You see, my professor is fond of having questions where 3 of the 4 answers could easily be the correct answer, except one is very detailed, and is the MOST correct answer.  If you don't know all the details of every topic, you're screwed.  :-(  So, I suppose that a B is good, especially when the majority of the class got C or below.  Okay, so, while on the topic of psychology, I guess it would be fitting to mention that the SI (Supplemental Instruction) leader has been trying to make me jealous.  Okay, well, the thing is, I only see him before class.  I have to get to campus like, an hour before my classes start, because if I don't, there's no parking.  So, I just head over to the area outside my lecture hall, and catch up on reading for various classes.  It's proven to be very effective, thus far.  I haven't fallen behind on readings yet.  Anyway, Mike gets there about 20-30 minutes early each class time, too.  He will come and sit near me, and "read" a book, and occasionally peer over the top of the book at me.  When he feels that I've lost concentration for a few seconds, he'll chime in with a question or comment.  He asks me a LOT to come to SI (despite the fact that I've told him I can't).  I tell him that on Mondays and Fridays, I definitely can't go, because the session is at 11 and I have a class.  On Wednesdays the session is at 1pm, and my last class ends at 11:50.  I don't need the help badly enough to sit around campus for an hour waiting for an SI session.  Anyhow, on Wednesday as I'm walking over towards the door to my class, I see Mike sitting on a bench with this girl that sits in front of me every class meeting.  Anyhow, so he keeps looking over towards me while I'm walking over... I mean... I couldn't hear what they were saying... but he LOOKED like he was up to something.  So then I go sit down, and I can hear them, cause, well, they were purposely talking loud.  She said, "Yeah... we SHOULD go out this weekend or something...", and he said, "Maybe I should give you my number....?"  (Note:  This was pretty rehearsed sounding... not like normal conversations flow.)  I nonchalantly look that way, and I see him get this smirk on his face out of the corner of my eye. I think nothing of it, and I go into class.  The girl comes and sits in front of me (as normal... not by MIKE, like you would THINK someone would do if they were going to date).  After awhile she turns around as she's "picking up her pen that she dropped," and she says, "he was trying to make you jealous."  Then she smiles.  Anyway, I didn't talk to him that day.  And when I talked to him yesterday, it was an answer to his request of me attending SI.  I told him what I always tell him.  Whenever he asks me to come to SI, I say, "here we go with you making feel like I'm dumb enough that I NEED SI..." and his response yesterday was, "Here we go with the cute come-backs to my invitation.."  Anyhow, I'm at a point right now where if he wants to go on a date, he is going to just have to ask.  I'm not initiating anything, because truthfully, if I just re-evaluated my life, and decided I shouldn't be in a committed relationship right now, why would I try one with someone else?  Ah-ha!  You see my point...  Anyway, I dunno, truthfully.  :-)  I just know that I'm going to let whatever happens, happen.  I'm not forcing anything.  I'm going to attempt (for a change) to let fate take a hand in my life.  We'll see how that goes.  I'll keep you posted.

         Yesterday was... interesting.  My parents went to Kerrville to do some work at my Grandma's (cause she's moving back in tomorrow) and when they left in the morning, it woke me up.  I tried to go back to sleep, but couldn't.  So I ended up being awake at 10am.  I had breakfast, and attempted watching tv.  There was nothing on.  So I did some laundry.  Then THAT got boring, so I cleaned up the bathroom.  Then I decided to eat some lunch.  After I ate lunch, I took a shower, and after that (since Ricky was in town) I called over there to see what was going on.  He said he was going to get his hair cut, and after telling him about my day, we decided I should get out.  So, he came and picked me up and we went over to the place he gets his hair cut.  Apparently he missed his appointment (but not REALLY... he made the appointment that was written on the calendar).  So, he got something to eat, and then we went over to his house to bug Mike.  His Dad had just gotten home, and told us that he brought home leeches.  So, we went to play with them.  We tried getting them to suck Mike's blood, but they wouldn't.  His Mom got home from her day out, and was grossed out by the leeches.  Anyway, they were all going to go eat with Ricky's cousins and aunt, so I told him when they were done playing with the leeches I should go.  But in the meantime, Patty called over to Kimby's to talk to Trinity, and told her I was coming to dinner.  So I ended up going with them.  We went over to see Trinity, Kimby, and the rest of the bunch.  We went out to eat at Joe's Crab Shack.  Which I thought was sorta ironic right now.  While we were there, Mike kept pushing the idea of me dating Joey Melancon... AGAIN.  He just won't give up.  We left there and went back to Trinity's and were there for about 30 minutes.  I dunno really how long it was, I just know it was long enough for Ricky's Dad to watch the sports stuff.  hehe  Anyhow, we headed back to Ricky's, and attempted the feeding again with the leeches.  Mike used Patty's needle (the one she uses to check blood sugar) to prick himself, and got a leech to attach!  Then that one fell off, and he got another one to suck on that same spot!  YAY!  We got this stuff on tape, and got pictures.  And he was telling his friends online that he had a leech on his finger.  It was exciting!  Then when it was like, midnight, I told Ricky I should probably get home, so I could make an effort to get to church the next morning.  So, when we got here, they came in, because I wanted them to see a thing on the blast! website.... very cool website if you were in marching band, and like to see cool visuals and stuff.  The URL is http://www.blasttheshow.com/blast.html.  Go there if you want.  Then they left, after Mike had made his mess, and such.  It was good times.  Definitely took my mind off the craziness of my life (recently) for a night, which was good.     LinktoComments(' ')    urlLink ">Comment

      So... I don't really have any complaints for TODAY... but for the week in general.  Yesterday my first class got cancelled.  I found out the night before.  AFTER I had busted my ass to get the assignment done.  I wanted to sleep in, but couldn't if I wanted to have a parking spot.  :-(  Then I figured I would just use the extra time from not having my first class to study for my test in World Civilization.  But, of course THAT got postponed.  So, I will have my stupid World Civ test tomorrow.  I think I'm ready.  Of course, I'm not a particular fan of history, so it's kinda boring to me.  I dunno, the professor said to use the book's website quizzes to study, because he actually reworded some of the questions on the text's quiz to put it on OUR test.  YAY!  Ugh!  Anyway, today was a pretty good day.  I saw Mike Prewoznik as I was walking to the building of my first class today, and we sat and chatted and he played a bunch of songs on his guitar for me.  It was cool.  Then he walked me to class.  It was a weird feeling... I dunno... I'm absolutely sure there's nothing to it... it was just weird to be around Mike in that sense.  Anyhow, Friday is my first Psychology exam.  Wish me luck.  4 chapters of stuff, and I think the most demanding and most horrible will be the chapter about the brain and nervous system... ACK!  Um, what else?  Not much.  That weird guy "Danny" from Judson called me again the other night wanting me to go out on a date with him.  He kinda gives me the creeps.  I think I may block his number or something.  Okay, nothing else going on right now.  I'm not even going to attempt adding the commenter thing on here, because it ISN'T WORKING!  Any suggestions about this can be sent to me via email... and I'd actually really really REALLY appreciate it... ;-)  Email me at DRUMR158@hotmail.com  Laters people.

        Hey guys... I know the comment stuff isn't working... I dunno why... I copy/paste the codes right from the websites... and they either use the same comments for two different posts, or they don't work at all... it's weird, I don't understand it, and I am not interested enough in HTML to fix the problem by way of html knowledge... :-)  Yesterday on the way home from Kerrville, my parents and I witnessed a horrible accident on IH-10... most of the accident was acctually over on the Westbound part of 10.  When we drove by (at a very slow 5 mph) we saw a Channel 4 news van there, so we collectively decided to tune in later and find out the details of the story.  Anyhow, as we went on further on IH-10, it was crazy how backed up Westbound was... I mean, they had redirected people off IH-10 about 2 or 3 exits before the scene of the accident... We were thankful we only sat in traffic for 20 minutes as opposed to the OTHER traffic which we probably would've been sitting in for over an hour.  It was seriously that bad.  I just wasn't moving AT ALL.  Anyhow, later we tuned into the news and found the whole story out...  Apparently, an 18 year old guy was speeding down IH-10, and weaving in and out of cars.  He got impatient about waiting for someone to move over out of the "fast lane"  so he just opted to pass them on the shoulder... He got by them, but clipped a truck that was in front of him, and both of them went flying off their side of the highway, through the grassy median, and into the opposing traffic.  Now, I believe it was the pickup truck that the 18 year old hit that actually hit head on with another car, because when we passed by the accident there was a white truck that was smashed up good, and what looked like a minivan that was pretty much just a pile of car debris.  Then there was a small minty green car in the grassy median.  The minty green car was the one the 18 year old was driving, and since it wasn't too banged up, I'm fairly certain that the truck was the vehicle which hit head on.  Anyway, on the news they said that the couple that was on the Westbound side was returning home to Arizona, I believe from a vacation in San Antonio.  They were killed instantly.  Anyhow, it was just sad to pass all that up... seeing that... and realizing that it doesn't matter how good a driver YOU yourself are, because crap happens, and well, it's usually just a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  If it's your time to go... then it's your time to go.  Because, think about it... is there really that much you could do in a matter of seconds if you saw a vehicle flying at yours from the other side of the highway???  Anyway, at the end of the news report, they said that this teenager had been involved in another (very minor, but reportable) accident that same day BEFORE all this happened... so he may be facing severe charges.  I hope they throw this guy in jail.  I mean, that's just messed up.  He didn't learn from the first mistake he made that day... and because of that, he caused a couple their lives.  Oy!  Okay, well, so that's my sad story... and it's really from yesterday... nothing is going on today, except I'm doing lotsa studying/reading... and doing my assignment for Masterpieces... YUCK!  Oh yeah... and it's raining here... not hard... but constantly.

         Okay, so I figured I'd make a post on Friday the 13th... just cause I like that creepy, witch-like crap, and so... out of that came the decision to post something today.  ;-)  Today on the drive home from school, it hit me that it's 3 weeks (for me at UTSA) into the semester.  They've flown by, so I'm sure the rest of the semester will be no different.  The past few days I've done a lot of thinking about a lot of stuff.  After a month of not talking to me because of a big argument and such, "Cam" and I have been talking.  We talked everyday, Mon-Thurs.  The first day was the most horrible, because we rehashed everything that happened, I got bitched at and such... it was just... depressing.  However, I think there's great potential that he and I can remain friends (which is all I want after careful evaluation of our previous attempts at serious relationships)... we've been able to chat casually the past few days... and there was even points where we admitted things we missed about hanging out with each other.  Anyway, everything seems to be okay in that respect of my life.  Classes are demanding (and will only get MORE demanding from this point on) but I am interested in all of them.  Even World Civilization.  Masterpieces of Music is my favorite class thus far, next in line is Psychology, and then Biology 2 and World Civ.  Psychology has been really interesting and fun.  The professor adds enough humor to make it interesting, but not so much that it sets me in a "slacker" mode for the class.  We have our first exam next Friday... and I'm actually looking forward to it.  haha  I have a take home quiz assignment due in Masterpieces next Tuesday.  We're supposed to watch a movie (any movie) and evaluate the mood the music sets in certain parts, and why they used that music and such... what tones it sets... ya know...?  Any suggestions may be left in my comment box for this post  :-)  Anyway, so for those of you that I told about my Grandma's house (which flooded because of a toilet that cracked open) the repairs are pretty much done.  They fixed the floor throughout the house, and they replaced the cabinets and such in the kitchen and elsewhere... so, we're all going over tomorrow so my Dad can evaluate the work before my Grandma signs all the insurance paperwork.  I don't think we'll be there TOO long, though... because she still has no toilets and stuff.  Or actually, we'll have to go to my cousin Wanda's to use the bathroom.  I'm excited to see all the work (because they've been working on her house for like, a month)  Anyhow... like I said earlier, feel free to leave suggestions for a movie I can watch for Masterpieces, but keep it under an "R" rating... no, X-rated stuff... ;-)  hehe  Sorry, Mel... no Ron Jeremy!  hehe  LinktoComments(' ')    urlLink ">Comment

         What could I possibly say about today???  It's been a year since the tragedy our country underwent, and for the most part, on campus, people were really nice to each other.  Kinda like, ya know, you knew everyone else felt the same way.  On the road however... jeez, there were some people who were driving w/o a care in the world.  Just on 1604 and Walzem alone, I was almost hit 3 times.  3 times!!!!!  The one on Walzem was the worst... I was right next to the guy... I mean, not even in his blind spot or anything... and he started coming over into my lane from a turning lane.  Thankfully no one was in the lane next to me, so I merged over for a brief second to avoid being smashed on my side of the car... Then when I glance in my rearview mirror, I see the man (who was older... much much older) driving at about 20 mph.  20 MPH on WALZEM!  (people who live in SA know where Walzem is and know that for someone to drive at 20mph on Walzem is just pure CRAZINESS!)  Anyhow, I got home, and I decided to take it easy till later when I go to a memorial service at my church for 9/11.  My first class was cancelled for tomorrow... so I think I may just sleep in and not leave here till like, 10ish... of course, I may not be able to get a parking spot... So I may just end up going really early, and I dunno... Catching up on my readings for World Civilization.  We'll see.  Okay... this post needs a comment from Ricky... and right SPIFFY comment, at that...  the other one probably still needs a Melissa comment, though I dunno, cause I haven't checked it yet... But I would venture a guess that she hasn't yet responded... because she's been busy responding to other stuff... like email and IMs... hehe  :-)  But before I end this email.. has anyone else noticed some people not really joining into the rememberance of 9/11...?  Just wondering if it was worse in some places than here... or better, even....  LinktoComments('MANUAL')    urlLink Comment

         Well, it's been raining all day long.  BOO!  I was supposed to go over to Druck's apartment today, and we were going to hang out, and then go out for dinner.  However, now that all this rain has hit, they've been closing off lanes on 410... and I don't wanna sit in traffic all afternoon just to get to Druck's.  As for my day at school, it was okay.  Psychology was funny... very funny.  And that cute guy (that I told Melissa about) was there, and even though he sat on the other side of the room (because my side was full by the time he got there) he waved at me.  It was weird, because he's only talked to me once.  I didn't see Michael Prewoznik today, but I DID see Shannon's friend.  While I was waiting outside my psychology class, I put some lotion on my tattoo, so it wouldn't get all dried out.  Anyhow, this guy who was standing outside the class as well saw me and said, "That's a cool tat!"  It was odd.  I guess I'll have to get used to people looking at my leg from now on.  Anyhow, after psychology I had biology 2.  It went by pretty fast, the professor was telling us all about Gene Flow and such.  Anyhow, as I was leaving Biology, I was hoping that it wouldn't be raining very hard.  Boy oh boy!  It was raining so hard, there was like, 2 inches of water in the parking lot.  So, I got to walk through 2 inches of water all the way to my car, and of course people are jerks, so they drive by you fast and splash water all over you... I actually threw my fist up in the air at someone and said "Bastard", Melissa-style.  :-)  It was a long walk to the car.  Then I checked my phone and saw that I had a message from my Mom.  She was telling me that they had said on the news that there was some flooding at 281 and 1604.  So, of COURSE I was ecstatic about the drive home.  And of course, all this happens on the day that I want to get some errands run.  Anyway, so while I'm driving home, as I'm getting close to Stone Oak Pkwy, I see like, 4 police cars on West bound 1604 doing U-turns in the grassy median and gettin onto East bound 1604.  Then I look up ahead of me and see a fire truck, and some other police cars, and as I get even closer, I see a white pickup truck on it's side in the bit of grass between the entrance ramp and the hwy.  They were attempting to get someone out of the vehicle.  The vehicle which was FACING opposing traffic, on its side.  It freaked me out.  I guess it hydroplaned or something.  Anyway, so I get home, and I had called Druck and told him I wasn't going to try and get all the way over to his apartment today, that we'd do it another time, because I still wanted to try and get some errands run, but I would have to wait till the rain let up, and such.  But he's on his way over here as I type to pick up the Algebra books that Wolf sent for him and to use my computer to type up something for class tomorrow.  So, I'll still get to see him, but don't have to risk MY life to do so.  ;-)  On another topic, I had emailed Nelson last night, just to see what all was going on with him and the family and how the drumline/band stuff is going for him in Houston.  He emailed me back a LONG email... it was nice to hear from him, and he and I plan on keeping in touch.  Okay, now I go because I have to welcome my guest once he arrives!

          Okay, so I went to church this morning... can you believe it???  Yeah, I saw Pam and Dennis (for those of you who have NO idea who I'm talking about, Pam and Dennis Hickey were my Senior High Youth Group sponsors, and are like a second set of parents to me... though no one could replace the set I've got!)  They were incredibly shocked I was there.  Pam asked about the whole "Cam" situation, which I told her about.  Both took a good look at my tattoo, they asked about Jamey, and were shocked when I told them about how I quit working at Crestview Baptist Child Care.  Anyhow, so, the sermon was about the difficulty of giving love.  Um, well, anyhow, not much else happened, besides my getting to see Camryn Orr.  She is SUCH a cute baby.  She's about a year old, and she is such a social baby.  She loves to be passed around from person to person.  Very sweet, and loves singing (she was baby-singing with us anytime we'd sing during the service).  Okay, after church we all came home (my parents and I) and ate some food.  Then, we all crashed out for awhile.  This just proves that there's nothing better to do on a rainy day than nap.  :-)  So, now, I return to my slumber.

      7 September 2002 Okay, so I'm new to this whole scene, but apparently it's very therapeutic.  So, I'm giving it a try.  First of all, it's Rosh Hashanah!!!!  Celebrate as you will!  Secondly, this weekend I just visited the Austin bunch.  We had a great time.  Shawn's bro had his birthday this weekend, so Friday night we all ate barbecue and cake in celebration.  It was fun.  It was fun to hang out with that group again.  I brought some Smirnoff Ice (for the drinkers) and I believe we finished all but one out of 12.  So, it was good times.  This last Thursday (5 Sept) I got my first tattoo.  It's a froggy that looks like he's hanging onto my leg.  Ya know, I'm going to name him eventually, but I am still thinking of a name.  I have already established that the frog is male.  I don't know why.  He just is!  :-)  Anyhow, any suggestions may be sent to me.  Now as for the whole, me doing a blog thing... I don't normally "jump on the bandwagon" so to say, as far as doing what everyone else does.  BUT, this seems like a good way to keep people updated as to what I'm doing, being that I don't normally take the time out to individually chat with people online anymore.  It's not that I'm lazy, either.  It's just simply that I'm not at the computer long enough to talk to like, 5-6 people everynight... or every 2 nights.  So, this seems like a good way to post stuff that's going on, and then ya know... kill like 5-10 birds with one stone.  ;-)

      Well, all the kids have come and gone.  I had a very interesting night handing out candy, to say the least...  I decided for this year that I would make a "Halloween CD" and play it through the windows in my room... so, I set it to play continuously, and for awhile, a lot of kids didn't even come to the door (we watched them start up the walk, and get scared and run away).  HAHA  Sorry, I can' t help but laugh.  It's sorta funny.  So my Mom told me to turn the music down, and maybe at least then they wouldn't hear it till they were farther up the walk so they would have too much time to run away... in other words, I'd get to the door, dressed as a normal person, and they'd then realize they were in no danger.  Of course, if they were SMART about horror movies, they realize that it's the people you DON'T EXPECT to be the killer that is, in fact, the killer.  Oh well...  Anyhow, so, after a time of handing out candy to the little kiddos, I go to the door, and I look up, and I see Amber Dellinger.  WoW!  I haven't seen her in over two years!  It was weird to see her... with her 2 year old daughter!  And she told me that she had her son in the car (with her fiance`).  WEIRD!  So, she has a 2 year old daughter, and a 3 month old son.  We visited for a few minutes, and then she headed on.  Well, okay, so about 30 minutes after that, some REALLY cute guy came to the door.  I would venture to guess he's a junior or senior at TR.  Anyhow, he was the courtyard crowish type (well... a skater boy)... and *sigh*... he was hot.  So, we flirted for a good 5 minutes.  He was showing me all the candy he had gotten, and telling me some story about how he had been given a toddler shoe by someone... which was weird... then he proceeded to smell it after I asked if it smelled funny.  Hehehe  Man, lemme just say... if he was 3 years older... I'd have my way with him!  hehehe  He was just cute as could be.  And the gal that was with him seemed to be getting a bit tiffed that he and I were flirting so much.  I dunno if she was his girlfriend or one of his many adoring fans (I'm sure he has many fans... cute guys usually do).  Anyhow, then we started to run out of candy... and I finally shut the light and music off around 8:45.  It was so funny... I noticed people from years past.  And I had many tell me they'd come back next year.  I guess we give out AWESOME ASS CANDY!  hehe  It's cause my Dad buys it.  If my Mom got the candy, it'd be that "Kiddie Mix" sheisse.... anyhoo... Okay, I have no more to say right now... well, one more thing... I'm going to A-town tomorrow...!  yay!  I'll be there till Sunday evening.  Me and   urlLink Mel  are going to see The Ring tomorrow night... it's gonna be AWESOME!  I dunno.. maybe we'll go eat someplace, too...  I guess it depends on whether or not her Aunt is gonna party with her this weekend... in which case I may have to go to assist in the consumption of alcohol... ;-)  Anyhow, okay REALLY that's all I have for now.  I'll post more later... probably after I get back from Austin.      urlLink  postCount('Halloween');

Well, I had a good weekend, and I'm sure that next weekend will prove to be just as fun and eventful.  :-)  This weekend Ricky and Melissa came into town to finish stuff up with their Halloween costumes.  We all went to see Jackass:  The Movie on Friday night.  By "we" I mean Ricky, Mike, Melissa, and I.  We had a good time, aside from the experience I had at Jim's sitting next to Mike, who was acting like a complete ass.  But, after the movie and Jim's we went to Ricky's.  The three of them played a video game, I just sat and watched, and dozed off a few times... ;-)  Then, after Ricky had stopped playing the game, he and I were talking about various things and laughing a lot.  I was feeling silly by that point, because I was really really sleepy.  And I sorta act drunk or something when I am really tired.  It was good fun, though...!  Then Saturday morning Jamey called and told me to get down to the church to help out with the Fall Festival.  Well, it was good to see Jamey, and Pam's daughter Stacey... it was NOT good to get spit up on by a (very cute, but sick) baby.  :-(  Thankfully, I'm sorta NOT easily nauseatable (if that's a word) when it comes to kid poop or spit up/vomit.  That's a gained characteristic I got from working in childcare.  Anyhow, so, I got a spaghetti plate to-go, went home and ate it for lunch, and did some stuff around the house till I had to go to Roosevelt to pick up Mexican Dinner plates because my Mom bought tickets, and she and my Dad had to go to Shiner, TX.  Anyhow, the dinner was interesting.  I got to see a lot of people that I miss, and a lot of people that I don't miss at all.  I came home, waited for my parents return, missed out on seeing a kickass movie, but gained the chance to go spend time with Melissa and her family!  It was fun, I didn't realize how much I missed the Morris'.  And it sorta made me sad that the only time I get to see them is when Mel comes to town.  HAHA  I don't know how much they'd appreciate me just stopping by.  ;-)  Anyhow, we watched the movie "Dead Presidents."  Very interesting movie, if you don't mind war movies.  Cause for a long while there, that's what it was.  But it was funny to hear Mr. Morris's comments... hehe  Anyway, then I ended up staying there till like, 2-something in the morning, cause me and Melissa were 'girl talking'... actually, a lot of it was more laugh than talk.  But, at any rate it was lots of fun.  Hopefully this coming weekend will be just as great.  See, I tried talking Melissa into coming in town again next weekend so we could go see "The Ring"  (the movie we missed out on seeing because we were busy and couldn't make the movie on time).  So, she suggested me coming to A-Town to see the movie there with her, and that way I'd also get to see Wolf.  It was an excellent idea on her part, I must say!  :-)  So, next weekend I shall be in A-Town, doing various shtuff.  And I'll probably just stay till Sunday night this time, because my parents will be out of town and not at church this weekend, too.  So, I won't be attending church.  They'll actually be in North Austin, I believe.  But I'm not sure, so don't hold me to that comment.  Anyhow, on that note I shall close my blog entry for the day.  Comments about favorite Jackass moments (not limited to the newly released movie) are welcomed!  Auf weidersehen!      urlLink  postCount('jackass');

      The funny for today:  You know those stuffed animal things that people put on their cell phones (provided it's not a flip phone)???  Yeah, my Mom got me a frog "cellbaby"... haha... I attempted putting it on, but my phone is about 1/4 to 1/2 an inch too big... :-(  Oh well... another note... I got a bunch of pics because my Mom took a disposable camera of mine to have the film developed (she had a coupon to get a free picture cd).  Anyhow... it brought back good memories... :-D  Thing I would appreciate comments about:  should I use the Cell Baby.... or just keep it as another frog novelty item to add to my growing collection...?      urlLink  postCount('cellbuddy');

      Today, I woke up with an excruciating migraine... I went to sleep with a migraine last night.  I've been having migraines the past week or so.  It sucks.  It sucks a lot.  I don't know WHY I've been getting so many headaches, and I'm wondering if there's anything to worry about.  Anyhow, since I felt like crap this morning, I didn't bother going to classes.  I didn't sleep very well last night because of my headache.  Now, I've gone to classes before when I had a headache and was tired, but this morning I felt like I was going to hurl.  I decided I'd do more good to pop some more aleve and take something to try and clear my sinuses (hoping that was the cause of all my headache pain).  I took all the meds... I still feel shitty.  My conclusion:  It's not sinus pressure causing the migraines.  :-(  Like I said, it sucks.  A lot.     urlLink  postCount('headache');

      Does anyone hate school as much as me?!  I swear, I'm so ready for this semester to be over...!  And then I stop and think, "Jesus!  I have to register for Spring classes... and soon... :-("  I just want all my schooling to be done... and soon.  And I still have about 4 semesters left... :-(  2 more years?!  Maybe less if I kill myself in summer school.  But... at least I'll be done with school before a certain someone I know... hahahaha  sorry... it's funny...  wait... sad... SAD!  Damn it!  Sad is the word I should use..!  Anyhow... it'll be just my luck that within the next year I get shotdown by some sniper hiding in the wooded areas around the UTSA campus... and be killed... :-(  But on a happier note, I'm finally getting my film developed that has pics of the kids from my classroom at Crestview... good 'ol C-8!  I miss my classroom of kids.  They loved me so much.  One little boy Zachary, he was always getting into some kind of trouble, but he loved me.  His mom told me how he had to pray for me everynight, and he'd tell God to take care of me cause he loved me.  When I came back after my vacation, he was one of the first kids to go crazy and come running at me.  Sweet little Zachary.  I bet he's doing really good on the potty now.  Boys are so difficult... that's why they take longer to potty train.  I miss working with kids.  I really hope I can get a job with NEISD next semester!!!        urlLink  postCount('talkaboutpoopykids');       urlLink

      I have horrible luck with guys.  Ya know, I've been thinking of just finally saying something to "SI Mike" about going out sometime, because he seems interested but isn't making any moves on his own.  So, I was going to say something to him today.  He ALWAYS shows up early (around 30 minutes early).  But OF COURSE he picks today to show up late.  Not completely late to class, but later than normal, and with only like, a few minutes to spare.  And of course I couldn't ease into suggesting that he and I go hang out sometime with only 3-5 minutes.  *sigh*  Oh, well.  I guess I'll attempt bringing it up on Monday.  Despite my horrible luck with guys, I have managed to have GOOD luck with parking!  4/5 days this week I got a parking spot REALLY close.  It was so nice.  Especially to get a good spot today, cause I was afraid I'd be walking back to my car through the rain.  On a completely different note, I am no longer friends with someone I've been friends with for over 3 years.  Sad, isn't it?  I guess it's true.  Once you do sexual things with someone, and things don't work out for the two of you... it's near impossible to be close to them in any way.  Or maybe it's just that I've grown into a different person?  I don't THINK I've changed too much over the past 3 years, though.  I mean, I don't think my bestest friends would say I've changed.  Of course, they've most likely changed a bit, too.  So, I guess they wouldn't be too good a judge of change.  Cause we've probably all changed together.  Hmmm... well, I don't have much more to say right now.  I'll post some fun to read stuff next week about stuff around campus.  That's ALWAYS a crowd pleaser.  I can tell you all about the weird, freaky people on campus.  And oddly, I'm friends with a few of them.  They are UTSA's equivalent of the Courtyard Crows at Roosevelt.  :-)  Later!

      This was sorta an uneventful weekend.  I had my horrid Biology exam on Friday.  Glad to get that out of the way.  Also glad that I mananged to get a C.  Which was good, considering that was the norm.  He has evil exams like my Psych professor.  "What is the rainforest?  A) An environment which has a canopy.  B)An environment containing many complex organisms.  C)  A place where monkies sleep in trees  D) Two of the above  E) A, B, and C are correct"   BASTARDS!  It sucks... I mean, trust me, the questions were much more difficult than that, but that served as a good example of the set up of the ENTIRE EXAM!  50 questions like that!  I wanted to pull out my hair.  Anyway, I'm glad I got a C.  I'm already doing better than last time.  Okay, so, Friday night, didn't do anything.  Saturday I just kinda bummed around the house all day while my parents were in Kerrville.  Then Melissa and I decided to go see Sweet Home Alabama.  It was a great movie, aside from the stupid high school girls that were sitting around us, "awww"ing at EVERY single thing that was cute.  It'll be a harsh reality check the day they realize that guys really aren't that sweet to women.  Anyhow, it was an excellent movie.  And so then on Sunday my Mom kept saying she wanted to go see it.  Yes, you guessed it!  I got dragged to see the movie again the next night.  But I have to admit, it was more enjoyable the second time around, being that hardly anyone was in the theater.  I dunno, I welcomed going to the movies again, because I sorta got completely forgotten about.  See, I was supposed to see Wolf before he left.  Ricky was supposed to call me on Sunday when he woke up to let me know when I'd be able to come over or whatever to see Wolf and watch Friends with them (taped from Thursday).  I never got a call.  I finally called at like, 4... and found out that they were going to do something else, and that they were leaving soon after.  Yeah, so, that sucked, and I was really hurt.  But no one cares about that.  Let's talk about today and how I didn't wanna get out of bed to go out in the cold rainy weather to go to school.  That sucked.  BUT, I have accumulated a new and interesting SI Mike tidbit.  He has a hoody.  HAHA  I swear, it's not that often that I've seen a guy wearing a hoody sweatshirt jacket.  But today, lo and behold, SI Mike was wearing a grayish-blue one.  I know it's cheesy and hoaky that I find him choosing the same form of warmth as me amusing... but I gotta get my excitement somewhere, and watching the vinegar turn to jam has lost it's oomph.  This week is going to be Hell for me again seeing as how I have a Psych test on Wednesday, a test in Masterpieces of Music, and a paper due in Masterpieces as well.  It's gonna SUCK.  And this weekend won't be any treat either, because I'll be studying for my stupid World Civilizations test.  BLAH!  I hate World Civ.  I hate going to the class, because the lectures make no sense, and they are boring.  Historic stuff (especially early civilizations) is boring to me.  At least in my other classes either the content or the Proffesors are amusing.  Like my Biology professor, and his violent thrusts of the head when he gets confused.  It's so funny, he shakes his head so fast, and so hard, that it makes his hair fall out of place, and he has to fix it.  Repeatedly.  He gets confused a lot... like he says a wrong word, or he'll stop and be thinking really hard to think of what he wants to say next, and then he shakes his head (hard, mind you), fixes his hair, and go onto a different topic entirely.  Crazy old Dr. Jordan, always good for a laugh.  :-P  Okay, this is all I have for now, kiddies.  I'll post more later in the week once I've gone completely insane.

      I had some good fun this weekend with my friends April and Ricky!  April has been sorta stressed and sad about various things, so Ricky and I went to go and cheer her up.  We decided we'd go over Friday, stay the night, and leave sometime on Saturday... and that's exactly what we did.  When I got to April's she hadn't been home long from band rehearsal with the Bobcat Band (SWTSU).  Anyhow, we decided to go get some stuff from the liquor store.  I mean, we both just turned 21 in July.  So we had to celebrate being of legal drinking age.  Anyway, we um, bought all kinds of stuff to have mixed drinks later that night.  We waited at April's till Ricky got there, and then we all went to eat at Chili's.  We had to wait awhile, but while we waited Ricky and I told April about Sealab 2021, and other shows that are on Adult Swim.  We finally got to our table, and April and I ordered Strawberry Margaritas.  April didn't drink hers because she doesn't like tequila.  Anyhow, I thought it was good.  :-)  We then finished eating, and went back to April's apartment, and after a little bit, April and I decided to make some stuff.  So, we decided to try the Banana stuff first.  YUMMY!  That's all I have to say about those Banana drinks we made.  They were AWESOME. We used banana puree and banana rum, and of course ice.  Ricky even tried some.  Then after we drank the banana stuff, we made strawberry drinks.  It's a TGIFriday's ready made stuff.  It has the vodka and rum in it already, all you do is add ice and blend it.  It was good too... it was called Strawberry Shortcake.  Now, Druck called while all this was going on to vent about various things.  Mostly someone he had a crush on.  Anyway, we had him on my cell phone speaker phone, and we were all laughing at things he was saying.  At one point he was talking about some person, and he yelled "That BITCH!"  and anyway, that became the phrase for the rest of the visit among all of us.  It was a great memory.  There was also a lot of funny stuff that happened.  Like me and April got giggly, and well, she was cold, or something.  One minute me and April were talking, and she had her drink in hand, and she was like, I'm cold.  Then I turned and said something to Ricky, and when I turned back to say something else to April, she had ONE GLOVE on to hold her drink.  HAHA  It was one of the funniest things I've ever seen!  I called her Michael Jackson.  Anyway, she showed us her Halloween costume.  Haha  It's a porn star costume!  It's a little honey bee, and she got it from a lingerie shop online.  Anyway, the bottoms are made so your ass can hang out!  HAHA  We all had a good long laugh about that.  Mostly because April was laughing really hard when she was showing it to us, and she kinda fell on the floor she laughed so hard.  Anyhow, after we had been drinking and joking around and laughing, we got tired. So we went to sleep.   April had some stuff to do the next day with her sorority (a breakfast, and then a meeting with a National chick later) so Ricky and I slept in.  We woke up when April got back from breakfast (and before her meeting) and we watched Cruel Intentions.  Well, Ricky watched it for awhile by himself, cause he hadn't ever seen it, and after April left and went to her meeting, I decided to take a shower.  Anyhow, after the movie was over and I had had my shower, Ricky and I got hungry, so we made scrambled eggs with cheese.  Okay, wait.  I MADE SCRAMBLED EGGS!  hehe  So, we ate, and then when April got back, she wanted a Krispy Kreme doughnut.  Her apartment complex has a convenience store, and they sell Krispy Kreme there.  So, we went down there, but alas it was closed.  Anyhow, we then watched some of the Sealab episodes (cause Ricky brought them on discs and stuff) and then me and April had some double vanilla coke.  We added vanilla rum to vanilla coke.  It was interesting.  I think I would've liked it more if it had been just regular coke we added vanilla to.  Anyway, April was still craving doughnuts... so she eventually settled for Cinnasticks.  It was Ricky's suggestion.  He said they were "F***ing Great!"  And that was that!  Well, after all the fun, when it was about 9, Ricky and I decided we should head home (to Austin and SA).  Ricky had given me some things to take to SA to his family for him.  Anyway, I called his house when I was almost there, and when I got there his Dad answered the door.  He wanted me to come watch The Count of Monte Cristo with him and Michael.  I declined, saying I had to go home because my parents were expecting me (and it was like, after 10pm).  Anyhow, he proceeded to yell, "Well, FINE!" and slam the door in my face, except then he opened it back up and said, "I'm just kidding with ya, Kelsie" in his very southern accent and chuckling through the entire "Just kidding" sentence.  It was funny.  Big 'Ol Billy makes me laugh.  So, I'm glad that we cheered April up.  I think the Yatta thing cheered her up the most, though!  And she can watch it anytime she gets a sad feeling.  "We are the wad of dough...!"

      Borrowed from another  urlLink blog  which I've recently begun reading...  enjoy... 1. Stuffing: baked inside the turkey, or separately? Separately 2. Fresh or frozen turkey? Frozen 3. Cranberry sauce: jellied or whole berry? Jellied 4. Stay home or visit friends/relatives? Visit friends/relatives 5. Do you cook Thanksgiving dinner, or let someone else do it? I make something to take over to relative's house 6. Traditional turkey dinner, or an alternative (such as vegetarian)? Traditional (our family, specifically) 7. Regular potatoes or sweet potatoes? Sweet potatoes (or yams, which are oddly very similar) 8. Homemade gravy, or the jarred stuff? Homemade 9. What part of the turkey do you prefer...dark or white meat? I like the white meat 10. After dinner: football or Christmas movies? both, actually... we watch football, and continue our family's silly tradition of watching Rio Bravo  Now I go back to reading The Crusaders:  Warriors of God for my World Civ class.  I have a term paper on it due next week.  Oh YAY!  So, I'll post something after I get back from Kerrville... which will be Saturday sometime.  Maybe earlier if I decide to come home and start working on this term paper... but it's doubtful.  Hope everyone has a Happy Turkey Day...!  Have fun with your families... :-)      urlLink  postCount('27Nov2002');

      Well, I did a lot of nothing this weekend.  Friday my Dad left for El Paso, and wasn't due back till around 6:45 Saturday evening.  So, Saturday it was just me and Mom.  Yeah... we had planned on sleeping in Saturday.  Didn't happen.  My Mom woke up at 6ish, and I woke up around 9ish.  Then I watched some movies that came on.  In between that and the evening, I read some of the book I have to read for my World Civilizations class.  I have to use it to write a paper that's due a week from Friday.  So, you can guess what a portion of my Thanksgiving weekend will be comprised of.  It just kinda bites.  I'm anticipating the end of the semester, but I'm not anticipating the finals and papers and such that are due.  Oh well, it's part of the game.    I'm just ready for this semester to be done with.  I'm ready for the break.  I'm wanting to have a job again!  I miss working with kids so much.  I've had several dreams in the past two weeks about the kids I worked with at the Center.  It makes me sad.  I won't be able to do daycare stuff next semester and that makes me sad.  I'll have to just wait to do that until the summer.  My schedule for the Spring just will NOT let me work at a childcare or preschool facility.  Too much class stuff going on in the afternoon.  I may get a job somewhere next semester, but it's not all that likely.  That's the convenience of living at home, not having bills, and not HAVING to work.  So, we'll see.  Okay, well, now I must go to study, study, study for my last world civ. quiz.  I'm not looking forward to it.  Not at all.  But, I'm looking forward to getting the reading of The Crusaders out of the way hopefully BEFORE Thanksgiving.  It's not a terribly long book.  So if I can get it read before Thanksgiving, then I can spend the rest of the time after that compiling my data, and piecing my paper together.  That'd be nice.  :-)  Alright, kiddies.  I'll try to post something tomorrow, but if I don't, I'll post something before I go to Kerrville for Thursday and Friday, and then I'll update about Thanksgiving when I get back in town.        urlLink  postCount('25Nov2002');

      You know that children's book...  Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day ...?  That's how I feel... I just registered for my classes for the Spring.  I'm not excited about the new semester, as I usually am.  On Monday, Wednesday, Friday I have TX Politics and Society at 10am... on Wednesdays I'll have one class (an Early Childhood class:  Play/Creativity/& Learning) in the afternoon from 2-4:45.  Then on Tues/Thurs I'll have 3 classes:  In the morning Education in American Society @ 9:30, World Lit since the 16th Century @ 11am;  then in the afternoon at the downtown campus I'll have Music and Related Arts @2pm (which I have to take for my major, and also since I need an easy class!).  The only light I see at the end of the tunnel is the fact that on Mondays and Fridays (the days I hate being at school the most) I will only have the one class.  But Tues-Thurs I won't be done till late in the afternoon... ARGH!  I just want to be DONE with school.  And to top it off, of COURSE I put off declaring my minor in music, so I can't count on taking a couple easy music courses.  Oh, well.  Next Fall... I'll be doing the symphonic band thing, and taking all my music classes, in addition to my other classes.  All will be fairly easy.  Finally I'll just get to have FUN in my classes and at school.  That'll be a nice change of pace!  I really only have like 4-5 really DIFFICULT classes left.  Anyhow, now I shall go to enjoy my weekend...!!!      urlLink  postCount('22Nov2002');

      Well, my brother called today to let us know his results from the MRI on his knee.  Everything's okay, minus the fluid in his knee.  The Dr. suggested that the pressure from jumping around and running and stuff (playing soccer AGAIN!) is making the rod cause pressure to his knee.  Anyway, he should be fine.  He said it's a bit tight, but I totally relate to that.  That's how my knee gets all the time when the weather changes, and such.  Sometimes I wish I hadn't had the knee surgery, but I guess I probably would've gotten worse had they not poked holes in that bone to get blood flow.  Damn softening bones!  I'm 21!  I shouldn't have arthritis... it makes me sad sometimes.  Oh, well.  Moving on, this Sunday my Mom and I are ushering at church for the Thank Offering Sunday (where women usher and basically do ALL of the stuff for the service).  Jamey will be an usher, too.  Anyhow, then that evening we're going to UTSA for the school's production of  Messiah  which should be very good, because the events are always free, but this one was $2/$5 (depending on if you are a student or not).    I'm also getting very excited because I get to see all of my family next week for Thanksgiving!  I haven't seen my brother in about a month, and I miss him terribly.  He and I always have so much fun together, but he rarely gets to come here to San Antonio.  I think I'll attempt going to Houston to visit him soon.  Especially since he just moved into his new place.  Maybe I'll go sometime over my Christmas break.  I'll have time to do it then.  Anyhow, I'll also get to see all my little cousins and my cousin Kim and her husband Tim.  As well as my Grandma, whom I haven't seen in quite a bit.  It should prove to be interesting, as Thanksgiving in our family ALWAYS does.  Maybe I should talk about the stupid Thanksgiving tradition of watching  urlLink Rio Bravo .  Watch it sometime... it's an okay movie, and I'd probably enjoy it more myself if I hadn't seen it so many times.  Every Thanksgiving.  And it's a DUBBED version (dubbed over, rather in english by EVERY GUY in the family who has the entire dialogue memorized).  It's just going to be weird for me to see my youngest cousin Travis, because I haven't seen him in almost a year.  He's almost 2, and I'm sure that he's changed a great deal since the last time I saw him.  I wonder how "two" he is.  Hehe  I know ALL about kids that are very "two" being that I worked with the 2 year olds at the daycare.  Oh my... yeah, it's stressful to work with 2 year olds.    Completely moving onto a different topic, in January they're opening the Child Development Center at the UTSA Main Campus!  YAY!  I think I'll try getting a job there (if my schedule permits) and I'd also like to get a job there for the summer, maybe.  If I don't get a job with them, I'll probably seriously look into working with the YMCA childcare program, or with Trinity Christian Academy, since they're opening a new place up over off 1604.  I love working with kids, and I really want to work with kids again, but I think I'll definitely request working with ages 3 or older.  2 year olds are just sometimes too much to take, especially if there's 8-10 of them.  Plus, I don't want to do the diaper thing so much anymore.  I really liked working with the kids that were potty training.  It was such a feeling of accomplishment when they finally were potty trained, and I knew that I helped in their learning that.  Anyhow, that's all I have for now, kiddos!  I'll post something later...      urlLink  postCount('Name');

      I had a good weekend...  went up to Austin on Friday night, and got there around 1am (Saturday, technically)... Um, so, I got to spend a lotta time with Wolf...  We drove back to SA... and stopped at Jim's to eat lunch... then went on to the TR vs. Austin Westlake game... TR put up a valid fight... the final score was 9-3 in favor of Austin Westlake.  But, it was fun.  Anyhow, after that I took him to his parent's, and I got to see his baby sister... she's so adorable.  Then later that night Melissa, her brother Brandon, Wolf, and I went to see "8 Mile."  I thought it was a good movie, and I'm pretty sure I wasn't the only one.  Me and Melissa are G-Dawg Homies now... ;-)  Then after the movie we went over to the Ansley's to see Ricky and all of them... we watched the end of "Ocean's 11" with them... and then left...  Then we got back to Melissa's... and I was there for a few minutes...  I drove my car by her while she walked her dog to the stop sign and back... :-)  Then I went home because I was tired and I was going to church this morning.  At church we had a visitor pastor, and Ron helped with the service.  That's always interesting!  Anyhow, I had bumped my knee on one of the book racks when I was going in front of my Mom in the pew to get to my seat.  I bumped my bad knee.  It hurt... bad... to say the least.  Anyway, after a while I checked it cause it felt like it was swelling up.  It was a bit... but after the sharing of the peace the older lady at the end of the pew (Iona Tronson) scooched over down the seat towards me... and she asked, "Is that a tattoo on your ankle or the top of your boot?  I couldn't tell and I want to see it up close!"  haha  It was funny... she was so excited that I had a tattoo.  She's one of the "excentric" old ladies of the church.  :-)  I wouldn't be all that surprised if SHE has a tattoo somewhere on her body.  I don't even want to venture a guess of WHERE it is.  hehe  It was just funny.  Anyhow, I chatted with Ron after the service, and he (of course) gave me a huge hug... and picked me up while he was hugging me and twirled me around.  He's so funny!  But he was saying he hoped I could catch a few of his gigs during the holiday break.  His wife is taking a class (or two or more?) at UTSA this semester.  She had asked me how everything was going, and I told her I was just waiting for the semester to be over with lots of anticipation.  I'm so ready for the semester to be over.  I'm ready for this week, too.  I get to register (FINALLY!).  So, that's what I'm doing this week... I also finish my last psych lab tomorrow... and on Thursday I have one of the LAST music quizzes of the semester.  YAY!  That's all I have for now... I'll post more later in the week.        urlLink  postCount('17Nov2002');

      Not much going on.  Had two tests on Monday.  I'm not sure how I did, but I'm thinking it wasn't good.  Maybe I did okay on my psych exam, but even if I didn't, I get to drop an exam.  Yeah, and don't even bother asking about Biology.  I'll find out tomorrow how I did, but I'm thinking it wasn't good.  Let's see.... I'll be done with my psych labs on Monday, which will be nice because I won't have to worry about making up any labs next semester.  That'll be nice.  :-)  Tuesday I got my World Civ. test back, and I got a B.  This was especially surprising, because I really thought I had gotten a C or lower.  But a B is fine with me!  Yesterday I was sick... again.  I woke up with a migraine... then later on that night I got an upset stomach.  I'M convinced that it was because I tried Excedrin Migraine for the first time.  My Mom thinks that I would've had a reaction much sooner.  But, I dunno... sometimes it just depends.  Anyhow, it was not fun, of course PUKING never is.  Today was a pretty good day... went to class... all I had to do was watch  urlLink Amadeus , which is a movie that I really like a lot.  I began watching the movie at the age of 6.  Yes, I'm a weird one... but everyone has always known that.  Oh!  Last Thursday I got my  urlLink Return to Oz  DVD in the mail!  YAY!  I was so so happy.... I LOVE that movie.  And in all actually the only other person I know that watched the movie as a child is Ricky.  Which I suppose explains a lot about both of us... hehe  Um, tomorrow night (after a trip to the Symphony with my Dad and Uncle Scott) I'm going to Austin.  Wolf is going to ride back with me on Saturday morning.  We plan on going to the TR game... they're playing Austin Westlake... first playoff game for them.  Should prove very interesting... or very saddening.  Then I think that later on we're (and by we're I mean, Mel, her brother Brandon, Ricky, Wolf, and I) are  going to see 8 Mile.  It looks good... even though I don't particularly consider myself a fan of Eminem.  But, sometimes you have to throw aside indifferences for good cinema, right?  Like when I ended up liking Man On The Moon even though Courtney Love... the evil bitch that killed Kurt Cobain by hiring someone to off him... was a co-star in it.  Yes, I'm bitter that she took away one of the coolest musicians I've listened to... and STILL listen to.  See?  She didn't kill him because he still lives through his music... which is still very popular among kick ass rockers...!  :-)  Anyhoo... okay... so, this weekend should be very very AWESOME!  That's all I have for today.      urlLink  postCount('14Nov02');

      Okay... so, it's been an interesting week.  The rain finally stopped!  Which is good for now, though I know I'll end up missing it.  Let's see, what's new with me?  Well, Wednesday before Psychology I DID talk to SI Mike a bit.  But it was basically innocent flirting and chit chat.  I (apparently) was listening to my music and it was 'loud' and I was getting into one of the songs.  I think it was "Where Did You Go" by the Bosstones.  Anyhow, it's a good song!  Mike came over and he was like, mouthing words but not actually saying anything... argh!  So, I pulled my earphone away from my head and he just simply asked, "was that a good song???  cause it looked like it!" and smiled... and went back to reading whatever philosophical book he was reading.  Then I was finishing a chapter in this boring ass book called "The Crusaders" that I have to read to write a term paper for World Civ. and it was so boring that I threw the book onto the floor away from me.  Anyhow, he picked it up and gave it to me and asked, "What's the matter?  It's not good enough for you???"  His wit ASTOUNDS ME!  Anyhow, that night my Mom and I went to a UTSA Symphonic Band concert so I could get my second concert review done.  It was such a good concert!  Now I'm actually looking forward to being in band, because I know that it's good, and I won't be in a band with like, people that SUCK BALLS!  :-)  Oy, so, yesterday I had to stay on campus till like 3pm.  I had my first psychology experiment!  I finally got signed up for one!  It was boring... REALLY boring... we basically took a word problems test...  You know with stuff like, "Assuming the first two sentences are true, is the last sentence true or false?  ' Charlie has red hair.  Boys with red hair like chocolate.  Charlie likes chocolate.'"  Yeah... then we got to fill out a survey.  Oh well.  Then I got signed up for another one which is on Monday afternoon at 2:30-3:30.... and it's topic is Pitch Detection.  It sounds involved and fun... and I'm hoping it is!  Anyhow, so I've got 2 hours down and 2 to go for my experiments.  I also have a psychology exam AND a biology exam on Monday.  Which means a very UNFUN weekend for me comprised of LOTS of studying.  :-(  But, at least I have the football game on Saturday to look forward to.  And church, cause Jamey should be there, and Jamey can always bring a smile on her face.  Because we remember good times like when Sean had a bit of a crush on her, and when Ricky cut her hand with a pair of scissors in an attempt to scare the living crap out of her and me (which he did).   I'm not all that excited about having to be on campus so late, though.  On Monday, and for that matter, next semester.  I HATE being on campus into the afternoon.  There are some REALLY weird people around my campus.  REALLY WEIRD.  Like, UT Austin weird.  I really didn't think we had weirdos like that on our campus, but apparently we do.  Yesterday there was some odd looking fellow playing the bongos.  He was sitting on one of those beach mat thingys... like that's made out of woven grass.  Yeah, it was weird.  People on our main campus are much less empathetic to people that wanna catch a nap between classes and such.  I finally went to the HSS building after I had lunch and went over my notes for masterpieces, and I wanted to sleep for a bit cause I had like 2 hours before my experiment.  I had to attempt sleeping in one of those cubicle studying area things.  Yeah, the main campus doesn't have nice, comfy chairs and sofa things like we have in EVERY building at the downtown campus.  It was horrible.  I dozed off a couple times, but even when I did I was woken up by people that were screaming downstairs (the cubicle things are lined next to a balcony on the second floor so you can see and hear EVERYONE and EVERYTHING downstairs).  Anyway... it sucked.  I think on Monday, if it's not too cold, I'll take my scooby blanket and spread it out on the grass outside by the Sombrilla and sleep out there.  It just SOUNDS more comfortable.  I just hope one of the weird PERVS doesn't come over and try to lay on my blanket with me.      urlLink  postCount('8nov02');

      I am so tired of rain... which is almost unbelievable.  I usually LOVE rain.  I used to play in it when I hung out with the 'courtyard crows' at Roosevelt.  :-)  Good times!  I had a pretty good weekend.  I went to Austin to visit the crazy people I know there.  I stayed at Melissa's apartment with her and Stacie (one of her roommates... Alexis was gone for the weekend).  Anyhow, we had a pretty good time.  We went and saw  urlLink  The Ring  , and we also watched Clash of the Titans.  However, I must say, I had high hopes of getting to hang out with Wolf, but those plans fell through when Druck decided he wanted to come to Austin.  I must say, I was slightly less than pissed off about that.  Not to mention that he sorta invited himself to stay Sunday night as well... I mean, what does he care that Ricky and Wolf had to be up early to go to school and work?  HE wasn't going to go to classes and/or work today... Yes, I'm ticked.  It pretty much ruined my weekend as far as spending time with Wolf went.  Anyhow, today at school was interesting.  Driving to campus was horrible.  Walking from the parking lot to the HSS building sucked, too.  I got ALL wet.  However, I thankfully got an awesome parking spot... so I could've had MORE walking in the rain.  Classes went by... I was kinda in a daze.  Psychology was a bit less interesting than normal.  I think Dr. Baumann was in a bad mood or something.  Oh well.  Then Biology 2 SUCKED!  We watched some movie about how plants pollinate.  :-(  ACK!  It was SO boring... and he kept replaying things.  "Look at this butterfly... it's DIFFERENT.  It actually collects pollen as well as nectar!"  Well, JEEZ Dr. Jordan.... who the HELL cares?!?!  Sheesh.  Anyhow, I now have to read/study for my STUPID T/Thr classes.  I have a quiz tomorrow in music and one on Thurs. in World Civ.  BLECH!  It's neverending, I tell you... NEVERENDING!  Later on (either tonight or tomorrow) I have to drop someing off to the Morris household for Brandon and Melissa's Dad.  :-)  Okay, nothing else to say now.  If I'm lucky I'll get a chance to post something tomorrow, but, I make no promises.        urlLink  postCount('weekendinatown');

      Well, not too much has been going on.  I've been playing the Sims Online a lot... I really like it.  It's very addictive.  Um, I went and saw Two Weeks Notice with Jennifer on Friday.  It was actually a pretty good movie.  Very much a chick flick, but good.  Um, I've been sick... so I've been at home a lot.  Just bumming around, and being sick.  Taking lotsa meds, sneezing, coughing, losing my voice.  It's great!  I have been practicing my guitar, and I've learned 10 notes and a bunch of little songs!  WAHOO!  I'm actually pretty good, if I do say so myself... ;)  I'm really enjoying my break, and not having to worry about lots of reading and stuff every night.  That's been really nice.  I pulled off a 3.0 from my classes last semester!  YAY!  So, it bumped my grade up a bit... I'm at a 2.89... I wish that'd round up to a 2.9... that'd be nice.  But, I think after next semester I'll be golden.  Um, we're taking the tree down, soon.  I'll miss it!  Of course, the past 3 days, I haven't been able to smell it anyways... Nothing going on in the dating scene really... I (thankfully) haven't gotten any more calls from Joe... but you never know if I will... he's so friggin' predictable, though... and with that in mind, I would guess that by Valentine's Day I will receive more phone calls... I hope he looks at it as an "I'm missing out...!"  GOOD!  He is... but I'll NEVER date him again... EVER!  There are many nicer guys out there... and I will marry someone who will treat me like a princess... :-)  He's not worthy of me.  Anyhow, I'll be going to Houston a week from Friday!  I get to see my brother's new apartment... and hit the town with him.  I hope I get to see Dave and Jana and Hayden!  I have a feeling that Wolf is going to bail out on me for Blast!  here in San Antonio.  Oh, well... if he does, then I guess I'll find someone else to go with me.  I hear thunder outside, which means the "tornado" is coming... yes, that's right... we have a tornado watch...  They apparently got "strong signs" of tornadic action... so I go now... I'll post more later... and fill you in on my crappy (sick) life...!  :-)  If I don't post before 2003.... HAPPY NEW YEAR to everyone!  I'll be pissed at midnight on 1 Jan 2003!  :-D  Comment if you must... ;)       urlLink  postCount('30Dec2002');

      Just wanted to say "Merry Christmas" to everyone.  It was a good Christmas.  I got froggy PJs from my Mom and from my parents I got the gift of music.  They gave me a REAL guitar this year.  Complete with case, pitch pipe, and books (to learn chords).  Anyhow, I'm really excited.  And I got a surprise from my brother!  He got me tickets to Blast! in Houston.  Well, a ticket for him and one for me.  We're going on his birthday, 11 Jan.  So, the weekend before classes start, I'll be in Houston with my brother at his new apartment.  Partying.  Hopefully I'll get to see Dave and Jana... and their new baby boy Hayden.  WOOHOO!  Anyhow, from my other relatives, I received money from my Grandma, and from my Uncle Scott I got CDs and DVDs.  He also gave me a gift certificate to Best Buy... that combined with my G-ma's gift will buy me TSO (The Sims Online)   YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     From friends I received:  Melissa-Chasing Amy DVD (awesome!) and a Ben Kweller CD (which I'm already liking a lot);  Jennifer-a shade thing, and a candle that smells wonderful!; Wolf-Bath and Body Works stuff (woohoo); Druck-this kick ASS moving picture!  it's so awesome and all my relatives now want to steal it from me; Ricky-I got 2 DVDs... When Harry Met Sally, and Minority Report!;  Jamey-she's bringing me wonderful stuff tomorrow...  I had a wonderful Christmas... and I have wonderful friends to be thankful for...  Merry Christmas to all of you... I love you guys!    I also got to see Ben and Lizzy last night at church!  It was wonderful... I haven't seen them in such a long while... I didn't realize how much I missed them... Me and Ben showed our tattoos off to each other.  It brought back memories... and we got some good hugs in... hopefully we'll see each other at church Sunday (provided we both show up).  I saw Jeff Timm, too.  He seemed so glad to see a familiar face.  It was fun for all.... :-)  That's all for now kiddies... leave a message if you'd like.       urlLink  postCount('25Dec2002');

      Well... lemme just say that at midnight... I was one of the happiest people on Earth!  My friends and I (Ricky, Mike, Melissa, Jennifer, and Druck) all went to the first showing of  urlLink LOTR:  The Two Towers  at midnight today... it was SO GREAT!  I don't wanna say anything cause I'd give it away... but we had such a good time.  There were lots of things to make fun of in the movie... and it was just awesome...!  I can't wait til  urlLink LOTR:  The Return of the King  comes out!  Next Christmas season... one year.... CAN'T WAIT!  I got to see Jennifer's Mom's CRAZY dog Jen-jen... wooo... he gets so excited when visitors come over... so excited that he pees.  We also (me and Jen) went to the store to get candy before the movie... and we were gonna get ice cream, too... well, I finally found the DMB One Sweet Whirled Ben and Jerry's ice cream at our HEB... so, YES, I was ecstatic... and lemme just say, it's SOOOOO good.... coffee ice cream always is, though.  ;-)  Anyhow, I really don't have much to say... besides if I told the entire Two Towers plot and exciting stuff... which would ruin it for those who have yet to see it... so I keep quiet... I'm really getting excited about Christmas, though... we're gonna have fun.... me and my friends and stuff.... Oh, and lemme make an announcement... Tomorrow's is Jen's 21st Birthday!  HAPPY BIRTHDAY JEN!  I wonder if she'll get smashed...  That's the gloriousness of being 21... well... not really... but I'M young, and I'm gonna have MY fun while I can!  Oh... on a side note... It's odd to me that someone would need attention so badly, that they threaten suicide... for the record, I think that's pathetic... and especially when it's someone I told I didn't want to know or talk to anymore (and after he said the same... minus his calls in between his words and mine on the situation).... :-)  Okay... Enough venting... just go see LOTR:  The Two Towers... cause it's the bestest!!!!       urlLink  postCount('18Dec2002');

      My finals are finally over!  Now I do the HAPPY DANCE!  YAY!  My biology 2 final was really not bad, of course that may be in part to my studying for 2 days!  :-)  Tuesday I had my World Civ final, and I must admit, I was really very scared about taking a blue book exam for a final.  It was so much easier than I thought it'd be.  My essay ended up being about 3 1/2 pages long.  The identifications part wasn't bad either.  When I turned in my blue book I also got to find how I did on my paper.  I got a B+... pretty good, considering I seriously thought I'd get a C-.  :-)  I didn't really read the book till the week it was due... and I didn't type it out or put anything thought into it REALLY until about 11am the day it was due.  And I had to have it turned in by 5pm.  hehe  I'm so bad.  If I would've put more effort into it, I would've pulled off an A+... which is the norm for my papers.  I love writing... but only about things I like... and I can openly admit I don't like history... let alone the comparisons on the Crusades and Jihad.  BLAH!  Anyway, the last final I had was this morning at 7:30am.  ACK!  I hate early finals... but, I think I did okay.  Not my best, mind you, because I was really not as prepared as I should have been... but I sorta burned out... I just kinda knew that I didn't have enough time to REALLY learn some of the concepts... well... not learn... to keep them straight... Anyhow, so I just sorta said, "This is how it is..." and finally went to bed, because it would've done me less good to stay up all night studying.  Anyhow, I'd say I knew about 80% of the exam.  Which is about how I did on the other 3 exams.  So, with luck, I'll pull of a B in that class... if not, then I'll settle for a C.  He was a difficult, but AWESOME professor!  The only good thing about waking up so FRIGGIN' early, and being at school to take a final that FRIGGIN' early, was getting to see and chat with Mike.    Check this out!!!  Last Weds. morning (last day of Psych class) I was sitting on the bench outside of the lecture hall.  I was sleepy, so I decided to let myself doze for a bit (I had an hour).  There was this guy sitting next to me on the bench, and he was reading some intellectual magazine (like I think it was a modern sociology mag or something of that nature... didn't pay TOO much attention to it).  So, I curl up, and I was sitting sideways on the bench (the back of the bench was on my right side...) I had my knees up (so I was curled up) and I used my red hoody jacket as a blanket and leaned my head on the back of the bench (on my right).  So, I dozed off, and having no perception of how much time had passed I decided I should survey the area and see how many people had showed up for class (more people, less time till class started)... anyhow, about 20 feet away, standing along the outside wall of the lecture hall is Mike... looking dead straight at me... staring... when I noticed... he tried to play it off, and sorta looked away, but kept looking back.  It sorta weirded me out... I'm not used to people WATCHING me sleep.  Anyhow, there were only a few people there, so I laid my head back down and dozed off again...  now... this next time I came to, I again opened my eyes to see how many people were out there now... and I almost peed on myself... because no longer was "modern sociology" guy there... but Mike was sitting RIGHT next to me, and watching me sleep... I was sorta taken aback... but, then he sorta just smiled at me, and asked, "Did I scare you?"  And I said, "Sorta... being that when I saw you before you were about 20 feet away... and now you're 2 feet away... and I didn't even hear that other guy leave... or you come sit here in his place...."  OY!  Then I couldn't close my eyes anymore... I just couldn't.  I was too freaked out that he would watch me... and he STILL kept looking over at me... like I couldn't see him... and he'd get this gleeful smirk on his face... then he'd sorta look away... one of the last times he looked at me like that, I looked right at him... and I asked... "what, silly?"  and he made some comment about how he was "taking in the moment"  it was so odd... he also kept doing miscellaneous things to like, try to keep him busy... and he at one point had a piece of paper and a pen... which I have NO IDEA why he got it out...  I don't KNOW about this guy... he seems so odd... but it intrigues me BEYOND belief.... I also was talking to a girl that sits in front of me in Psych, and she frequented SI sessions and got to know Mike a little better than me... and anyhow, she was saying she felt bad for him, because she didn't think he was with any family or anything for Thanksgiving... apparently he's adopted, or something... and I didn't quite understand... she was being very vague, I think she started feeling bad about talking about him... but I think he knows his birth family... and he wasn't able to be with EITHER family (adopted or birth).... so sad... Anyway... that's what's happened since last week...  Comment if you must...       urlLink  postCount('11Dec2002');

      Well, first of all, I'm glad to be done with Masterpieces of Music and World Civilizations.  Technically I'm still not done with World Civ. because I still have the final... but today was the last lecture... and "Good Riddance" comes to mind when I think of that.  Bad news for today... Dr. Davies decided that our World Civ final should be a blue book exam.  Dum Dum Dum!  You know what that means...?  Essays all the way.  We have to identify and critically discuss 6 terms/people/occurences (that's 40% of the final).... The last 60% of the final is one long ass essay over a very broad topic.  YAY!  Let me do my FRIGGIN' happy dance!  :-(  Nein, Nein. Nicht das blaue Buch!  (for all that don't know German... it translates to, "No, no.  Not the blue book!"  Anyhow... and of course I'm worried about my Bio exam.  It shouldn't be too bad, though.  I'm most comfortable with the botany section, and well... that's 2/3 the exam right there.  And I figure for the comprehensive part, I can just study the old exams.  We all have the correct answers, now.  So hopefully all will do well.  As far as my Psych exam... I'm surprisingly not worried at all.  It's the last exam I'll take (On Wednesday)... and we're getting a review... and he's holding a review session on campus Monday night before the exam... so, I think I'll do pretty well on that.  I'm thinking final grades will be... A (Music), B (World Civ), B (Psych), and C (Biology).  Which would give me a 3.0 for the semester.  Which, TRUST ME, I'd be happy with...!!!!  I'm gradually pulling my grade up from when I plumetted to a 2.90 about 3 semesters ago... if I pull off a 3.0 this semester... I'll be sure to have a 3.0 once again... which is of great importance to me.  Anyhoo... I must go now and begin typing my EVIL World Civ paper comparing Jihad and The Crusades....

      December 1st is quite possibly the hardest day of the year for me to get through.  You see, when I was in 6th Grade, my Grandpa committed suicide on this day.  He had been battling cancer for (I take a guess at) 3-4 years.  First he had skin cancer... then he got  urlLink lymphoma  (I think that's how it's spelled).  Anyhow, my Grandma had just broken her ankle at Thanksgiving that year... so she came to San Antonio to have corrective surgery.  My Grandpa was getting in home treatments at that time, so my Dad went to stay and take care of him.    I still remember that day.  I stayed home sick because I had the stomach flu.  Around 5ish, my Mom decided she'd better call over there because she just had a feeling.  My Great Aunt Mary answered the phone, and was screaming about my Grandpa... when my Mom first told me that my Grandpa had shot himself... my first reaction was "In the leg or something?!  Is he okay?!"  Never did I think that my Grandpa would commit suicide.  It wasn't like him at all.  He (before his cancer got bad) had such a love of life.  Anyhow, as if that weren't traumatic enough, my Mom, Uncle Scott, and I went there to the house to be with my Dad that night and then go to the funeral home the next day so things could be set up.  So usually, I hate staying the night at that house... it makes me think of that night.  I didn't even sleep, I just laid there listening to my Dad tell my Mom chunks of what happened.  How he first walked in the room... and saw my Grandpa leaning against the headrest.  And how he just thought he had bumped his head when he was trying to stand up... or that he had passed out.  And then when he got over there, he realized everything by what he saw.  That's the only time I have ever seen or heard my Daddy cry.  Ever.  Anyhow... that's my sad story.  This is the thing that will haunt me on Dec. 1 for the rest of my life.      urlLink  postCount('1Dec2002');

        Oh, what's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other word would smell as sweet    Okay... so I realized after fixing my archives, and going back and checking that they pull up and everything that in my VERY first blog post... back in Sept. of 2002 I was attempting to pick a name for my frog tattoo.  As stated in the email... I've concluded that the frog is male... so, now I bring this to my friends and whoever else may stumble across this blog, to leave (via the comments) any suggestions for a name for my frog tattoo.  He MUST have a name!  :-)  I was thinking, since Ricky's name isn't Dax, and everyone thinks it's cool... maybe we should name the tattoo Dax.  Dax the frog.  It has a certain ring to it... ; )  LEAVE COMMENTS PLEASE...       urlLink  postCount('31Jan2003');

        Zack    Despite jokes of Zack being gay, he's not.  I guess I should tell the story of Zack on here for all to know.  Then I won't have to answer one question several times.  : )  Zack is a guy that I met on TSO (The Sims Online).  You meet interesting people in there, lemme tell you.  The first person that I met on TSO was a guy named Trevor... we got to chatting because he lives in Dallas... and so we had a common ground.  Anyhow, he and I chat on AIM every now and then, and he invited me to a live chat with the Maxis people back before TSO went live.  He works for a computer company, so he has connections.  Anyhow, long story short, meeting him and his wife thru the internet showed me that not all people in the digital world are freaks.  Anyhow, so I guess it was the same week that TSO went live that I met Zack (Damien Michaels is his sim's name).  Anyhow, he seemed really nice, and the more that he and I carried on conversation, the more we kept saying what the other was thinking, or typing things out exactly the same at exactly the same time.  So, we decided we had way too much in common to NOT keep in touch... and thus our friendship was born.  Zack, however, made a comment probably the 2nd or 3rd day that we talked about how we were probably soul mates... and that we met each other for a reason.  And he'd joke about how he was going to come to San Antonio, yada yada yada.  Harmless jokes.  Anyhow, so we decied to swap email addys, and keep in touch that way, because it's not always convenient for us to hop on TSO.  So, first thing's first, we told each other basics about us (i.e. how we grew up, what our family is like, funny little stories from school, and what we wanna do in life).  He's a really nice guy, we've become friends, end of story, right?  Wrong!  Especially when he makes comments that we were married in a former life.  I dunno... it's weird.  Sometimes, I must admit, I do get an eerie feeling about how odd it is that I met someone who is really nice, has a great family, and essentially holds every quality I've always said I want in my future husband.  He grew up going to church, he's pretty dedicated to serving his Lord, he has musical talent, his family is much like mine, etc.  Problems with this too-good-to-be-true guy:  Firstly, I met him on the internet!  YIKES!  That scares the Hell outta me!  Then again, I DID see a "Wedding Story" episode where the couple met on the internet.  Secondly, he lives in North Carolina.  That's kinda far away.  Then again there are perks to this story:  He's finished with college (as opposed to the last guy I dated who ISN'T finished with college at the ripe old age of 31), he has a stable job (he works on construction sites, testing the soils to make sure that they're usable for roads, buildings, etc.... However, his degree was in Hospitality Management in hopes of opening a themed restaurant, or running a resort), he is only 5 years older than me... which isn't that much older... and technically I believe it's more like 4 1/2, from what I understand he'd be willing to come here to visit and/or stay, and I've seen a picture and he's not a mutant (like Ricky suggested)... he's very normal, and just nice, well-kept looking.  I dunno... all I know is it's scary.  It's odd to me that I could potentially have met my "soul mate" on an internet game.  That just seems weird.    My Take on it All    My plan is to remain friends for now... if something should happen in the future... then I'll let it.  I don't plan on initiating any form of relationship OTHER than friendship.  I have other things that I plan on focusing my energy on right now.  Like finishing school, and getting my teaching certification, and my friends.  I don't even know if I want a relationship right now, because that's a LOT of work to do... and more so w/ school going on.  Jennifer is all concerned... she's afraid I'm getting attached and that he'd be different if I ever DID commit to meeting him and spending time with him if we visited each other.  Well, yeah... that's true... but in the same respect, that can be true even if you met the person for the first time face-to-face.  People often are different when trying to win someone over to date... and then their true colors come out later.  That can even happen with friends, as all of us have found out in past times.  My goodness, how long did I know a certain drum instructor, and NEVER did I think he'd turn out to be the way he was!!!  So, yeah.  That's just a risk you take when getting close to someone, I guess.  But, I'm comfortable with just being friends.  And like I said, if something happens later... then let it be.  "For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see, there will be an answer, let it be."  And on that note, I shall stop talking about all this... because it makes me feel confused.  Comments may be left... just don't be really harsh... I have a feeling most will say, "You ARE attached"... well, yeah... as a friend...  I'm attached to Ricky, Druck, Jen, WOLF... etc.  But as a friend...        urlLink  postCount('28Jan2003');

        Update    I'm due to have my first exam this coming week.  Oh, YAY!  : (  In other news, I talked to Jamey for the first time since Christmas.  We had such a good conversation... and we're thinking of driving up to Austin the weekend of her birthday to hit 6th street!  WAHOO!  I miss hanging out with Jamey... we used to do so much together.  I think it'll be much easier for she and I to spend time together once she's going to UTSA.  She's transferring there next Fall, so, we're ready to PAR-TAY!  I saw SI Mike the other day on campus... we made eye contact and smiled, but that was basically all we had time to do.  Maybe Tuesday he and I will catch up...  What else is happening..?  OH!  I cleaned my room very thoroughly for the first time since before finals.  ; )  I'm lazy... but at least my room is very spic and span now!  Freshly dusted and such.  Now I can hang up my moving picture!  I've had to leave it in the family room for such a long time... so I'm glad I can put it in it's permanent position in the house.  : )    An Unexpected Comment    The other day I was talking to Zack, and he said something that caught me off guard.  He made the comment that he thinks "we were married in a past life."  Okay... since I didn't know what the Hell to say to that, I laughed it off.  Yeah, I am beginning to think he's very "into" me... more so than I am him.  He makes comments all the time about visiting me in San Antonio.  Interesting concept, I guess.  I don't plan on anything... but you never know.  I live by the whole, "whatever happens, happens" stand point now.  So, if he should happen to visit... and we get along... and things progress... so be it.  If we are meant to be just friends, that's fine too.      That's all I have for today... I'll post more later.  :-)  I've got reading to do before this week... GREAT!       urlLink  postCount('25Jan2003');

      Well, I haven't been up to much the past couple days.  Just doing the ordinary things... School... School... School.  Zack finally got in touch with me.  :-)  I was quite happy about that.  Oddly, I missed him.  Not like in a "I want to smother him with my kisses and then screw him" kind of way, but a "I miss talking to him and him making me laugh" kind of way.  :-)  The email addy he was using he cancelled because of some hacking stuff that happened.  Anyhow, he's using a different addy now, and so he and I have gone back to emailing a lot... and he continues to make comments about visiting.  haha  I just can't stop thinking of how odd it'd be if something developed there down the road.  How funny!  Anyway... classes are going well.  I have some tests coming up the end of this month already!  Wow!  They don't waste any time, do they?  I'm just excited because I think the chances of me getting all A's this semester is actually a GOOD chance.  ; )  Then this summer I'm going to try and knock out about 12 hours of coursework over the 2 sessions.  I have to get stuff done.  Then next Fall I'll be taking my music classes.  :-)  Band, basic skills 1and aural skills 1 of music.  I really don't have that much left.  And the more aspirations I have to get things done... the more I stop and realize, I actually CAN be done by May 2004 instead of Dec 2004.  :-)  So I may only have 2 big semesters left (instead of 3).  YAY!  Anyhow... we'll see.  I'll post more later on... probably Friday or Saturday.        urlLink  postCount('22Jan2003');

      Well, man!  This weekend was jam packed of fun...!  Friday afternoon I headed to Austin around 3.  So, I got there and brought my stuff in and me, Ricky, and Druck watched 24.  :-)  Then Wolf got home from work, and we all decided to eat something and the plan was to go see Drumline.  Okay, so we ordered Papa John's... Druck almost burned the pizza boxes in the oven cause he switched the heat from "warm" to "broil" which, any person (who cooks) knows can make bread into a burnt mess in a matter of 2 minutes.  Anyhow, so we left later on to go over to Pflugerville to see Drumline at the discount theater.  We got all the way there and Drumline wasn't even playing there.  It was playing at a theater down the road.  We then had trouble getting OUT of the parking lot in Pflugerville (due to the small spaces AND the small amount of space in between rows of cars).  Ricky was a traffic controller!  :-)  Anyhow, we finally got out, and hurried up to get to the other theater.  Once we got there we found out the movie had already begun AND it wasn't a discount theater.  OY!  So we just went back to the apt. and had some birthday cake.  We watched tv, too.    Saturday Ricky's parents came over and picked him up to go visit Jeff and Marta with them.  Wolf and I planned to leave later.  We ended up leaving earlier than we had planned because there was nothing else to do anyway.  So we got to San Antonio, and he watched sports with my Dad.  Then I got ready to go to BLAST! and we left early to eat at Jim's.  Both of us ended up getting our usual Jim's meals... then we headed on downtown.  We got to the Majestic and got some souveniers.  Then we took our seats (which were AWESOME by the way).  We were pretty much DEAD center.  We were 2 seats in from the center aisle.  It was awesome!  I think the show here in SA was better than the one in Houston.  The trumpet soloist was better, at least.  His chops were AMAZING!  We had an awesome time.  Then we talked to a few of the performers after the show... though we didn't get any autographs OR photos!  :-(  And I had wanted to meet Nelson's friend Kevin Brubaker... but he was off doing something else.  And so was Vincent Oliver!  :-(  He was an awesome marimba player, and I had really wanted to take a pic with him... but he was gone doing whatever, too!  :-(  Anyway, we left and got out of downtown, and then stopped to pick up Ricky.  He came back with his parents... he got his keys and other stuff he needed... anyway, after a short time there, we packed back into my boat to drive back to Austin.  We got there around midnight, and we watched tv a bit.  Then Druck came out and said he was hungry, so we got TCs.  YUM!  Nothing better than TCs at 2am!  haha  It was weird.  Anyway, we then all fell asleep.  Well, actually I was the only one that was TIRED before 3am.  So, everyone left me alone in Ricky's room and I slept.  I slept very well, actually.  His bed is comfy... Friday night I had fallen asleep... and I didn't change my sleeping position at ALL during the night.  Which is weird for me, because I usually wake up several times during the night.   We all woke up around 12:30pm today, and we decided to go eat.  Since today was Wolf's 21st, we let him decide.  He wanted Jim's again, so we all got ready to go.  We drove over to Jim's and ate.  Ricky won a Betty Boop from the crane machine, and we then all took turns trying to win Shaggy.  But we couldn't.  Damn bastard!  Anyhow, we went back to the apartment, and Wolf wanted to do something.  So, we played ImagineIFF... it was SO MUCH FUN!!!  I will have to buy the game, because it was great, and I think it'd be fun for me and my family to play (like, my parents, brother, and Kathy maybe).  Anyway... we had fun... then we just all sorta bummed around.  After awhile we watched some more 24.  Then around 5:45 Alexis and Phillip came over to see if we wanted to play frisbee.  I dunno... they ended up playing... but I left at 6.  I don't know if Ricky played or not... Wolf and Druck were playing w/them though.  :-)  I got home and ate a bit and had some pie with my parents (for their 33rd anniversary).  It was great fun.  They were watching a movie, so I finished it with them, and then we listened to some of my BLAST! cd that I bought.  Anyway, it was a very fun weekend.  And there's still tomorrow.  Who KNOWS what I'll do once I'm done reading for World Lit?!  ;-)     One last thing:  H A P P Y   B I R T H D A Y,   W O L F ! ! ! ! ! !       urlLink  postCount('19Jan2003');

      Well, I have a full weekend ahead.  Right now Wolf's cake is in the oven and I'll decorate it as soon as it cools.  Then I'll soon be on the road towards Austin... I think the plan is to try to see  urlLink Drumline  tonight at the $1 theater.  Then tomorrow me, Wolf, and Ricky are heading into San Antonio, and tomorrow night at 8pm, Wolf and I are going to Blast!  :-)  I'm taking my camera... and maybe I can get some pics with the awesome drummers in the show!  WOOHOO!  Anyhow, we're heading BACK to Austin that night... because Wolf wants to be back in Austin for his birthday... and then I'm returning home Sunday.  My original plan was to stay til Monday, but I have to finish reading  Tartuffe  a play by Moliere.  So, I need to be here so I can get that done.  I still have about 4 Acts left.  :-)  If I'm in Austin, it won't get done.  I'm really happy I get to see my friends this weekend... I've missed them more than I realize.  Though, it's been hard to miss Ricky... what with the voicemails we leave each other... it's a comfort!  :-)  Although the Smeagol messages creeped me out a bit... but he only did it because he knew I'd laugh.  ;-)  My Mom thought they were hilarious... well, I  think  she did.  She walked away muttering something about me and Ricky being crazy.  hehehe  Well, we are... Crazy... Crazy like the Crazy Cat Lady!

      Well, I've met all my professors now.  All are pretty nice.  I don't like my World Lit II prof very much. She is an idiot.  And by idiot I mean retarded.  And by retarded I mean slow.  She talks like she's got a speech problem.... you know Stevie from  urlLink Malcolm in the Middle ?  Yeah, she talks like that.  By the end of the class I wanted to choke myself.  We already have a reading for that class.  We're reading Moliere's Tartuffe.  Oh, yay!  It's in verse.  Everything rhymes.  It's sorta sickening.  It's not romantic verse like Shakespeare... :-(  But all in all, I'm excited about the course!  I think it's going to be fun... and I actually am glad I can do a research paper again.  A nice lengthy 10 page one!  :-)  My Texas Politics and Society professor (Startin) is awesome.  I pity him for leaning towards the conservative end of the spectrum, but he's still cool.  He doesn't tell CHEESY jokes... that's the norm for his age group of men.  He was in the air force for 35 years.  He retired 5 years ago, and has been teaching the past 4 years.  He said the norm average for his class is A.  I'm excited.  My Early Childhood prof... well, he's like a mix between Austin Powers and Dr. Evil.  Being that his teeth remind me of Austin Powers' and some things that he says (like "riiiight") remind me of Dr. Evil.  He wants to be Walker, Texas Ranger, though.  He's VERY much a cowboy.  He wears boots, a stetson, and a western print jacket.  He's cool, though.  Even though our class is supposed to meet from 2-4:45 he said he'd pretty much let us out around 3:30 every class.  :-D  He also said the final is optional.  We have several opportunities to do different things.  Go to lectures, help build playgrounds, go check out something at the zoo playground.  The final is worth 100 points.  Working on a playground project is worth 150 points.  So there ya go.  ;-)  My Education prof seems very nice.  She's one of those women who loves to teach.  It's obvious.  She's cheery, and when she was talking to us she was telling us how her objective for the semester is to help everyone get an A.  Now I dunno how she plans to do that with a class of 250+ students.  But by all means, be my guest to try lady!  :-)  I'm all about getting an A!!!  Last but not least my Music class is going to be friggin AWESOME!  I have Dr. Bruenger once again (I had her for Masterpieces last semester) and we just have a BUNCH of fun in that class.  Yesterday we sang a song to get to know each other.  I felt like I was in elementary music class again!  We do lots of stuff like that, as well as getting to write a play in our groups!  It's complete with music and sound effects, etc!  Such an easy term project, cause it'll be fun!  In all, I'm very excited about my classes now!  I think that I could actually pull off all A's!  Wouldn't THAT be cool?!  I'm very hyped up to start things.... so much so that as soon as I got my World Lit book, I began reading the Moliere play...  I'm also excited that I will only have 2 finals this semester!  WAHOO!  That makes me so happy!  I dunno if I'll devote time to a job to earn money to visit England or not.  We'll see, though.  I'd like to get a small job to have a bit of extra cash.  I was thinking of applying at Borders or something.  Maybe I could get to do like a Storytime thing with little kids there!  That'd be so awesome.  Anyhoo... that's all I have for now... but I'll come up with more things to say during the semester!!!  :-)  You can GUARANTEE it!        urlLink  postCount('15Jan2003');

      Okay... first gripe of the semester... I went all the way out 1604 today... got to campus an hour early (so I had parking)... found my class... sat outside the lecture hall, and wrote a letter.  Then about 30 mins before the class was to start, we all checked the hall, and no one was in there, so the few of us early birds went on in and sat down.  Then about 5 minutes before class was to start, some misc. girl yelled into the lecture hall, "Hey, there's a note out here saying TX Politics is cancelled today!"  You can not even IMAGINE the jaw-dropping action that went on in there!  Man, so... it was my only class today (Mondays and Fridays will be like that).  And so I went all the way out there for NOTHING.  That pisses me off!  Oh well... I think maybe this guy is new to UTSA and to TX.  Because for the professor it said TBA until about 5 days ago.  Otherwise I'm generally excited about classes tomorrow.  I have my Education in American Society class, my World Lit since the 16th Century class, and my Music class.  Then Wednesday I have my Wednesday only class which is and Early Childhood one... Play/Creativity/and Learning.  I'm thinking that the most difficult classes I'll have this semester (ones that would actually take effort to get an A in) will be TX Politics, and probably Education in American Society.  I'd be more worried about about the lit class, except I really LIKE english related classes.  And I've always gotten A's in those classes thus far in my college history.  It won't take any effort at all to pull an A in my music class.  Plus, I've already had that prof. before.  And the early childhood class will be a breeze.  I know all about play/creativity/learning.  I had to know about that when I worked at the child care center.    Other news, I think after a few weeks (seeing how classes are going and how demanding they are) I'm going to get a job.  I'd like to work long enough to save up money and go to England probably during Spring Break or after finals in mid May.  I'm really excited at the prospect of going.  It's either save up to do that... or seriously consider and talk to my parents about doing a study abroad in Australia attending the University of Sydney.  So, we'll see.  However, I dunno if I wanna do a semester abroad.  I'd be gone for my 22nd birthday... cause I'd leave for Australia like, July 22.  So, we'll see.  Anyhow.... I'll post more tomorrow after I meet the other professors.  We'll see how demanding this semester shall be.       urlLink  postCount('13Jan2003');

      Well, I had a wonderful time this weekend... and with all the crap that's been going on... it was a good escape.  I would elaborate on how awesome the show was, and about every little aspect of it, but then on the off chance that Wolf still reads my blog regularly, I'd ruin some of the surprises for him... so I keep my mouth shut till next weekend... that's when I'll spill the beans.  Anyhow, I start classes tomorrow.  I'm very thankful that I only have the one class.  I can go to campus in the morning and return home... and lounge around for awhile... I'm not even going to attempt to get books till Tuesday or Wednesday.  It's happened too many times in the past where I buy all the books listed, and then find out I don't even NEED some of them... in such cases I then have to go BACK to the bookstore and return stuff.  And I HATE standing in return lines.  So, I've learned that to avoid that I wait until after I go to all of my classes... and THAT'S when I buy books.  Tuesdays-Thursdays will be my long days.  On Tues/Thurs I won't be done till 3:15.  On Wednesdays I won't be done till 4:45.  :-(  Phooey!  Long days SUCK.  Oh well, at least they don't fall on Monday or Friday.  On those days I only have one class.  Which will make it easier to go visit people out of town on the weekends.  Anyhow, I return now to my "getting ready" for school tomorrow... Gotta clean out old stuff to make room for the new.  :-)  I'll post more later, and I'm sure throughout the semester you'll hear funny jokes about my professors!  I love telling stories about their little quirks.  ;-)  Bye bye for now!       urlLink  postCount('12Jan2003');

      Well, I'm in Houston.  Not much has happened here yet, since I've only been here for about 3 hours.  I'm pretty sure that tonight my brother and I will watch a movie and eat some chicken and dumplings.  He's had a rough day at work... and seems pretty stressed out.  Thank goodness my Mom sent food, because now neither he or I have to worry about cooking something.  :-)  Anyhow, tomorrow we're going to eat at the Hobbit Hole restaurant here!  I'm so excited, because it's just fun to be in a restaurant themed after Tolkien's cute little creatures.  Maybe I should brush up on some elvish, have a line prepared...  haha  YEAH, RIGHT!  Anyhow, I'm just going to go relax some more tonight... bust out the guitar and play some stuff... wait for my brother to get home, he should be here within the next 30 mins.  His apartment is SO nice!  It's huge, it has vaulted ceilings... and it's just NICE.  He's got it decorated all nicely.  Only weird thing is there's all these little yellow sticky notes all over from Kathy to him saying "I love you... ALWAYS!!!  :-D"  AHHHHH!!!  Well, at least I can pretend that she loves ME always, too... ;-)  Anyhow, I'll post more either tomorrow night, or Sunday after I get home to update about how Saturday goes... especially Blast!

      Well, it's the last day in San Antonio while everyone is still here (for me, at least).  I'm going to Houston tomorrow morning.  Me and my brother are going to hang out and have some fun going to Blast! and stuff.  Then I'm coming back home on Sunday morning.  I'm excited to go and visit, but at the same time, I wish it was LAST weekend, because then I wouldn't be starting classes the day after I get back from Houston.  At least I only have one class on Monday, though.  And then the following weekend will be pretty easy.  :-)  Blast (again) in San Antonio, and probably some time in Austin, since I don't have class that following Monday.  We'll see.  Depends on how I'm feeling.  Jennifer leaves on Saturday for England.  She'll be back in May/June.  Just in time for my 22nd birthday!  WAHOO!  :-)  Anyhow, I'm hoping that I do very well this semester.  I'm sure I'll do GREAT in my music class... that'll be an A.  Probably my Early Childhood class, too.  I like that stuff, it's fun.  The World Lit. class I'll probably do very well in.  Because I like literature, and I have never gotten less than an A in my english related classes.  I'm a brain when it comes to that stuff.  So, as always I go into the semester being generally excited about classes, and having good expectations for myself and my final grades.  I have Dr. Bruenger again for my music class.  I need to make sure that I go and declare my minor this semester, early on.  Then next Fall I'll be in band, and then the following semester (Spr. 2004).  Just gonna get them out of the way.  I'm actually pretty excited about doing that.  I just need to work up my etudes some more, and hopefully get my new(er) clarinet before then.  :-)    Lemme just say that I had no idea guys were so clueless about the female anatomy.... do we like being fingered in our urethra?  NO!  Can we not sleep on our front side, because our boobs are too hard to allow us to do so?  NO!  We're not "tripods."  Boobs (real ones, at least) squish down.  Man... what an interesting night.  If someone asks me if I'll finger myself in the urethra for them I think my comeback would be, "When my clitoris grows hair!"  Enough on that topic... it scares me.  And I never want to SEE someone show me how they think a girl should be eaten out ever again...Anyhow, not much more to say now.  But I'll post more later after my trip to Houston!  Everyone going back to various places, have safe trips!!!       urlLink  postCount('9Jan2003');

      I can't believe that the stuff that went on last night happened...!  Man... scat is bad.  Anyhow, yeah, Jennifer made a comment about me saying she's lazy... well, she IS.  Last night she wanted a drink of water.  Instead of picking up the glass and drinking (like normal), she just leaned her mouth on the glass which was on the table, and leaned it enough to get a sip!  OMG!  That's so lazy.  And was so funny.  We were all on a sugar high.  I guess that happens when you have lotsa frosting and stuff around to eat.  Anyhow, I believe I'm going to see  urlLink Chicago  tonight.  Ya know... Richard Gere, Renee Zelwegger, and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  And it's a musical!  I'm so glad that musicals are coming back.  I just got my car inspected... that was... BORING!  In other news, I start school a week from today.  Am I ready to hit the books again?  NO!  What else...?  Oh, I am going to Houston on Friday-Sunday.  My brother got me and him a ticket to see  urlLink Blast!  in Houston for my Christmas and his Birthday.  I should probably buy him a cake or something.  He'll be 30.  I should really rub it in that he's getting old!  :-)  I guess I'm getting older, too, though.  Anyway, yeah, so I'll be gone this coming weekend.  I'll be hanging with my brother, and seeing his new apartment.  It should be a good weekend.  Then the following weekend, Wolf and I are going to Blast! in San Antonio.  My brother and my Mom didn't really communicate about their Christmas presents.  :-/  But it turned out good for me...!  I get to see an awesome show TWICE!  Anyhow, so I think I have 20 Jan off from school.  So I may stay on in Austin or something (since I'll have to take Wolf back on Sunday... maybe I'll just stay til Monday...).  Anyhow, not much else going on... except, I met a guy on TSO... and he's really nice.  His name's Zack, and he is convinced that I'm his soul mate.  We're a lot alike.  But alike in the way that it's like I'm his other half.  It's odd.  He lives in North Carolina... and he's joked about coming to visit.  But for some reason, I think he's SERIOUS!  Weird... we'll see.  Wouldn't that be weird if something happens there...? HAHA.  3 years down the road he and I get married, and have a kid on the way... WEIRD!!!!  Anyhow... not much else to say now... but I'll post something later.       urlLink  postCount('6Jan2003');

      Well, I think I'm getting what Ricky had... either that or my it's all in my mind... :-(  I went to see Catch Me If You Can last night with Mel... after I got back home... after she left... I guess about 15-20 mins later, I started feeling a bit... different... my stomach was turning a bit....  I'm now deciding what I can take... Pepto Bismol... ACK... I hate liquid meds... Anyhow... on the upside...  urlLink Catch Me If You Can  was a very good movie... I highly recommend it... when we got there we saw Druck, Ceci, Alex, Christine, Ceci's lil bro and sis (Tori and Vincent) and we saw Sean and Krystle... wow... it was like a drumline reunion for a bit...  Anyhow... Now I will go call Ricky back... and yell at him for making me think I'm sick too!  >P       urlLink  postCount('2Jan2003');

        Ice Sucks    Just for the record... I hate ice... AND I like it.  ;)  Yes, I'm a fickle one.  Well... I like ice because it allowed me to sleep in for two days straight.  I hate it because it caused me to be quite bored... and has taken electricity away from Zack so we have hardly talked lately.  He was lucky last night and had a battery for the laptop... AND was lucky enough that the phones weren't down.  So he could get on for a bit.  We talked for about an hour... then he was supposed to come back but didn't for whatever reason.  My guess is that phones went down and he had no way to connect.  Anyhow, I'm supposed to give him a call this weekend, but I don't even know if I can get through, because well... phones may be down.  Oh well... in other news... not much is going on.  My Mom's birthday was Wednesday, and so we all went out to Marie Callendar's for dinner.  We got the Kahlua Cream Cheese pie... it is SO GOOD!  I recommend it to anyone who likes a chocolaty-coffee taste.  Well, nothing else to say for now.  Hope everyone has a good weekend... I'll post more next week (or earlier if something interesting happens).

        Weekend Fun    Well, got back from Austin a bit ago.  We all had a blast!  Friday night we intended to go to Mr. Sinus at the Drafthouse, but it was sold out.  Then we tried getting tickets for Saturday's late show, and there were only 5 tickets left (and we needed 6).  Well, when Druck got back from his Target thing, he, Michael, and I played some Xbox.  Then we went over to the Billiards room and played pool for a bit.  Anyhow, on Friday night we went to Kerbey Lane for dinner, and headed to the Metropolitan to see  urlLink May .  The movie was one of the strangest, coolest movies I've seen in awhile.  I think it was cool... it was (as Melissa described) disturbing, but it was really cool.  Brings back memories of hanging with the courtyard crows... all those loveable weirdos.  :-)  Anyhow, so that was Friday night.    Saturday- We slept in, then finally got up and all showered and decided to go grab some food.  We came back to the apartment, bummed around, played Xbox, and then finally decided to go shoot some pool.  Well, Wolf's card wouldn't work, so we went and sat by the hot tub while we waited for Druck to come with his working card.  Ricky turned on the hot tub, and this HUGE mound of foam developed.  We guessed that someone put a scoop of laundry detergent in the tub, so one it started circulating water, it made bubbles.  Okay, so then Melissa called and asked what we were doing, and she and Richard decided to come over... and Alexis, too.  First I took a picture of Ricky sticking his head in the bubble hill that was in the hot tub...!  It was funny looking.  Anyhow, we played a few games of pool... probably about an hour.  Then we all decied to go to I Love Video and rent this kung fu movie we saw a trailer for before May.  It was called  urlLink Shaolin Soccer ... and it was FUNNY!  :-)  We all grabbed some food before we headed over to the girls' apartment, and then watched the movie.  Then the boys and I went back over to the guys' apartment.  We stayed up for a bit, but then fell asleep.  The weekend was fun... and hopefully we'll do it again soon.  Since we didn't see Mr. Sinus, we wanted to see it before they're done with Speed.  So, Mike and I will have to go back to Austin in a couple weeks or something.  Maybe we'll just wait til Spring Break.  :-)  That'd be fun!  Anyhow, okay... so... that's all for now... I'll post more later in the week!!!  Hope everyone had an awesome weekend...and hope everyone has an awesome week!  :-)

I wonder if Sandra Bullock will show up... ; )  The rest of the weekend will be spent in Austin until Sunday afternoon.  Then I must come home to study for an EVIL Education test... I like the class a lot... and the professor... but there's just SO MUCH stuff to study.  I just took my Politics exam... and it was really easy.  I think that I got an A.  There were only 2 that really threw me for a loop... and they were T/F  so I have a 50-50 chance on those.  :-)  Anyway, I'll post something when I get back in town on Sunday about the weekend.  Hope everyone has a great weekend... hopefully the rain will go away.

        New Counter, New Comment Phrase    Yes, I know... my blog is undergoing frequent changes, right now.  I'm in the process of changing from individual comments (on each blog post) to automatic ones... so IGNORE the post that have 2 comment links.  After awhile, there will only be one.  Also, I had signed up for a counter with digits.com, but later decided to continue my search for a prettier one.  Lo and behold, I found one that has a frog, so it HAD to be added to my blog.  :-)  I picked up the number of hits I've gotten overall with it... so, nothing's changed about that.  :-)  Okay, enough about that.    The Weekend    Well, I didn't do a WHOLE lot this weekend in the way of studying (like I should have).  Saturday I woke up and kinda bummed around a bit, then my parents and I began cleaning out the patio room.  We've had boxes stacked up in there for YEARS.  That's right... we've used it as a storage space since we moved in here before my Junior year.  We're pack rats, and so we have a LOT of stuff that we've accumulated through the years.  Some things were pleasant to find, like my middle school yearbooks.  Some things I bid good riddance to.  Like dolls, and the better part of my stuffed animal collection.  Those will be taken to Goodwill.  I figure since they're all in good shape, some other kids can get play time and comfort as well as company from them.  :-)  Okay, what else did I do?  Well, Saturday night Druck came over to personally give me my Valentine's Day card, which was wonderful.  Then he and I went to a movie with Melissa and her brother.  We saw  urlLink How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days , and it was pretty funny!  I laughed a LOT... I laughed harder than I've laughed in a while!!!  It was worth it... but then again, RICKY would shake his head and say, "But you like girly, corny, silly, CUTE little movies!"  This is true, but even Melissa's brother seemed to enjoy it a lot... and Brandon is usually very critical of movies.  Okay... then I got home and fell asleep.    This morning I woke up, and went through the adds.  Then I found my camera, so I have it ready for next weekend (I have to use the rest of the film... and I can't think of any others that I'd want to take pictures of than Ricky, Druck, Wolf, and any others that are in Austin next weekend and hang out with us).  Okay, so then my parents and I ate dinner, and I studied for a couple classes, as well as practicing for my proficiency which is on Tuesday.  I'm not nervous at all... I just wanna get it over with.  Then on Thursday we have our group presentation.  We have to teach a singing game to the rest of the class, we also have to play them an original ABA form song that I wrote (we split up all the different parts), show them an original painting, read them an original poem, and show them architecture.  All of these things must have the common theme of structure, form, etc.  It's a Related Arts project.  We're going to ace it.  The rest of my group is really great.  Minus one gal who can't count music for shit... but hopefully she'll get better.  I have my first Politics exam on Friday... and my Mom keeps telling me I should get the guy in there to meet up with me and study.  I dunno about that... but then again, we'll see.  :-)  Alrighty, any other news about school?  Not much... I'll update during the week... and be on the lookout for "WACKY WEDNESDAY!"  :-)  Talk to ya people later!  Oh, I hope Alexis got her Valentine's E-card!!!  But, I got like an error email about that addy... if so then I guess I'll just wait for the next holiday to send her an e-card...!  ; )

        Valentine's Day    Well, all in all I had a pretty good Valentine's Day.  My class got cancelled, so I got to sleep in... which was AWESOME!  Anyhow, so, after I woke up I just kinda bummed around for a few minutes, then I hopped on the computer, and Zack signed on.  Anyhow, long story short, we talked for about 2 1/2 hours.  About miscellaneous things... his little brother's emo band, other bands around right now that are awesome, etc.  Then he said he wanted to be my LD Valentine.  I thought it was sweet... hehe  Anyhow, I got flowers from my Daddy, which was nice.  I think he talked to my Mom to ask what to get, though, because it had flowers I actually like, and he doesn't pay attention to that stuff.  :-)    So the day progressed, I ate dinner, had some strawberries and homemade whipped cream, watched that ABC Family original movie "The One."  It was decent for a made-for-tv movie.  Then I got a call on my cell phone and thought it was Joe so I didn't answer.  Then the phone at home rang, and it turns out it was Jennifer calling from London!  She was like, why didn't you answer your cell phone... are you screening your phone calls...?  I was like, "If YOUR phone rang the way it rings when your 'ex' calls, and it was Valentine's you wouldn't answer either!"  :-P  Anyhow, we had a nice long conversation and talked about many things.  She's going to Westminster today...  Hmmm.... well, she'll be happy to see I posted something about Zack on here, because she asked about it (since I haven't mentioned him in a few posts).  Okay, so what else...?  Oh, well, I was on TSO (The Sims Online), and then Zack got on later... so we chatted some more on there... it was fun... our sims got engaged on Valentine's Day... haha... it's so cheesy... but it was cute to see my little sim get engaged.  I mean, poor Mykel has been proposed to before, but has always turned them down... because they're usually much younger... so on the 4th proposal by the 4th guy, she said yes.  HAHA  Oh man... my life is sad.    Weird Dreams    Well, I had a BAD dream about that guy from politics.  Goodness, I had this dream that some other girl in the class was talking to him and flirting with him, and he was ignoring her and running his fingers through my hair for some reason.  Anyhow, then he was talking to me, and he was saying that he had a son.  It was SO WEIRD!  Then he was saying his son needed a mom... and anyway... I get up and walk off in the dream without saying anything.  I just get the HECK out of there and as far away from him as I can.  I think it would probably be similar in real life...  I also had a dream that one of my bottom teeth was falling out... and it did, and then another tooth (that was behind it... like sharks have rows of teeth) moved forward.  That one fell out, and the next tooth from the next row moved into place and stayed.  It was so weird.  Well, so I'm done talking now... I have nothing more to say at this moment... Um, yeah... I think I'll go get a shower, and make my hair smell like coconuts once again... :-)  I got new Suave shampoo that smells like coconut... yum...

        Chicago    I saw  Chicago  for the second time on Sunday with my parents.  My Mom and I decided to take my Dad to go see it for his birthday.  They both really liked it, and I liked it EVEN MORE the second time.  I dunno why, but it was much better!  :)  Then today I bought the soundtrack.  :-)  It's really neat... I had downloaded the songs from the broadway show, but it's just not the same.  I really like the way that Catherine Zeta-Jones sings the songs.  I think she does a really awesome job.  And so did Richard Gere, oh my gosh... *sigh*  :-)  And truthfully, even though she had to be taught, Renee Zelwegger was a surprising talent!  So, anyhow, I'm making a copy of the soundtrack for Jennifer and sending to her in England.  I doubt she'd be able to get it very cheap there, so I'll save her a few bucks.      Valentine's Day     Valentine's is probably the WORST holiday ever invented!!!  To this day, I haven't had a good Valentine's Day.  Ya know, the sad thing is that I haven't spent all that many Valentine's Days alone...!!!!  Which means I always have CRAPPY boyfriends.  Anyhow, I think this year will be decent.  I'm not doing anything, though.  I have no date... but that's probably for the better.  I think I'll end up watching a movie.  I get to sleep in that morning, though.  My Politics professor cancelled class for that day because we're so ahead in the lectures.  Anyhow, back to Valentine's Day.  WORST HOLIDAY EVER!  It only gives room for let downs!  Well, in MY experience.  However, this year may turn out different.  Because I'm getting a card from Druck... and I may actually get some cards from others.  :-D  So, I think that this Valentine's Day may be a SPECTACULAR day!  At least I know I can watch  My Big, Fat, Greek Wedding !!!  I just bought it today!  It was such a FUNNY movie!  I really like romantic comedies!  I actually started to buy  So I Married an Ax Murderer !!!  Had it been on sale, I would've bought it... but I wasn't going to pay $20 for it when I knew I'd probably find it at Wal-Mart or Best Buy for like, half that.  Circuit City is GREAT for sale prices, because they usually have the lowest price.  But when it comes to regular, everyday prices, they're HIGHER.    Sick or not?    I'm feeling better, but I actually still have a twinge of ache in my stomach.  I don't know why... the only reason I can think of is that I didn't eat much yesterday, so maybe my stomach is starting to eat its own lining?  I dunno... it hurts, though.  Yesterday was CRAPPY!  I ate a LITTLE bit of soup, but not much.  Then for dinner, I ate some toast.  That was it... so then I ended up getting a headache from not eating.  It sucked.  Then I hardly slept at all, and I still got myself out of bed to go to class.  I was dragging all day long.  I had my first quiz in Music, and I aced it.  It was SO EASY for me!  We don't have class on Thursday, and we have our proficiency exam on Tuesday next.  I'm sure I'll ace that, too.  Everything's easy right now for me, and actually for many others.  Anyhow, I'm feeling a bit better, but I think I'm suffering from some insomnia.  But I've always had problems with insomnia.  It sucks.  A lot.  I hope I sleep well tonight... and I'm actually thinking of not going to early childhood class tomorrow....  We don't ever do anything in there!  We STILL haven't gotten a syllabus... and we don't do anything in there!!!!  Anyhow, it's a pointless class.  And I'm upset because I found out that Dr. Jacobs isn't going to teach after this semester.  So there goes my whole plan of taking 4 early childhood classes with him this summer.  :(  DAMN IT!  Oh well... I'm faily certain that the other ECE professors are equally as cool and demanding.  Anyhow, that's all I have for now... so I will leave on this note, and update later.       urlLink  postCount('11Feb2003');

        Overall Update    Well, I had an excellent time up in Kerrville.  My cousins and I had a HUGE snowball fight because there was about 2 inches of snow at my Grandma's.  It was also good to see my little cousins... except... last night I woke up at 3:30am with a HORRIBLE stomach ache, and ran to the bathroom to vomit for about 1 1/2 hours.  : (  I'm somewhat certain I picked it up from my cousins, because they were sick last week with this stomach virus.  But, if I didn't get it from them, I most likely got it from someone at school, because there's a stomach virus going around.  Ain't life grand?  Anyhow, I'm feeling better now... except I'm really hungry, because there's nothing in my stomach.  At the same time I'm terrified to eat anything, because I don't want to get sick again.  Anyhow... that's all I feel up to writing now... I'm pretty weak... sickness does that to you.  I will post something later in the week... provided I don't get sick.  I only hope I feel well enough to practice for my quiz and proficiency exam.  And I have to come up with a research topic by Friday for my World Lit class.  How the HELL am I supposed to pick a topic (in a VERY broad time span, by the way) for a term paper that could make or break me only one month into the semester?!  This professor is out of her MIND.  It's the only time I have SERIOUSLY felt someone should NOT be a professor!  She's stupid... it takes her forever to say a sentence... and she repeats the same idea in a different way... she can do that for like, 10 minutes... and she can find about 20 ways to say, "My cat is crazy."  :(  I hate that class...!

        What's Going On    Hmmm... not much, really.  I got my test back on Tuesday and I got a B.  Which apparently was the norm for the class.  I'm glad to know I'm in the "normal" category.  ; )  Anyhow, I met this really nice guy in my Texas Politics class.  Don't ask me his name, for I know not this information yet.  I will find out, though.  He's a very well-mannered guy... being that on Wednesday at the end of class he asked if he could sit next to me for class today (Friday).  My response was, "That's fine..." with a nice smile to go w/it.  I've never had anyone ask me a class in advance if he could sit next to me.  It's not like there's always a long line of people trying to sit next to me and I inspect each one denying many and accepting only one.  :-)  Anyway, it was nice to meet a mannered and sweet guy for a change.  He dresses pretty nice from what I've noticed.  Although today I was quite surprised to see him wearing a nice short sleeved shirt, a cap, and a pair of running shoes!  No jacket!  Is he NUTS?!  It's friggin COLD today!  The windchill is like 33 degrees... oy.  He'll probably be sick come Monday... especially if he does that the rest of the weekend.  Anyway, classes were... eh... But yesterday I had a near perfect day!  I was telling Zack about it... and then he asked me what 3 things could've made my 'near-perfect day' even better.  Haha... he's so funny.  I swear, when I read that, I just laughed for a while, because it seemed crazy to ask something like that.  But I obliged him anyhow.    In other news, I checked in on  urlLink Celestial Rose's  blog to find out the verdict of her sonogram.  They were going to try and see the sex of the baby again.  And they're 85% sure it's a girl!  CONGRATS to her and Cole!!!  It's so interesting to keep up with her blog and read about how her pregnancy is progressing and such.  : )  Especially since my biological clock (as well as Jen's) is ticking away!  hehe  TICK-TOCK-TICK-TOCK!      This Weekend    Tomorrow my parents and I are going to my Grandma's.  Tomorrow is my Dad's 55th birthday.  It's also Jamey's 21st birthday!!!!  HOORAY for birthdays!  Anyhow, we're going to my Grandma's in Kerrville, TX to spend time with family.  My Aunt Judy, my Uncle Scott, Kim and her kids (Katy, Emily, and Travis) are all coming over there!  Tim can't come because he has to work... :-(  However, I think that we're just going to have a great time!  And we may even have some snow to play in.  I think it's more probable that it'll snow in Kerrville than here.  But I guess we'll see tomorrow morning.  I'm really anxious to see the kiddos.  I've missed them, especially Travis.  He's growing like a weed... and Kim told me he's saying more words now!  So, I'm pretty sure that tomorrow is going to be a really great day!  Then the rest of my weekend will be spent doing some laundry and catching up on readings, as well as practicing for my proficiency exam in music and related arts.  On this note, I end my blog post for today.  I'll post more after the weekend and let everyone know about the kids.  If I can get some good pics, I may even post one on the blog page in the future... :-)         urlLink  postCount('7Feb2003');

        Rodeo    Well, the rodeo was fun and all... I guess.  I don't like the SBC Center all that much.  I think the design and decoration is pretty cool (they have a HUGE food court area, unlike most other arena places).... but seating and acoustics SUCK!  When you're sitting down, unless you have short legs, it feels like you've got the head of the person in front of you in your lap.  I was constantly trying to make sure I didn't accidentally knee the guy in front of me in the back of his head.  :-(  Acoustics could be better... but I guess that the SBC Center wasn't really designed for the sole purpose of holding concerts... It was mostly made so the Spurs could have a new home... even though they had a perfectly fine one at the Alamodome... and I fully believe the city just wanted to spend some money somewhere.    The grounds were pretty much the same... except the big breezeway garage-type thing where they had all the different booths... that's not used anymore... instead they used the Coliseum for this... which was nice, because it was good to get in out of the cold for a bit.  Food was basically just as good... minus the Van De Walle fajitas... that's pretty much a tradition with my family... I got 2 chicken fajitas... and they tasted like unseasoned chicken.  I guess they didn't feel like using fajita seasoning on them.  : (  The Blooming Onions were spectacular, minus the outrageous price of $6!  We didn't get anything else other than sodas... and lemme tell you... only in an arena can you buy a bottled soda for $3.50.      Update    I'm getting nice and behind on readings... of course.  Just as always, I go into the semester with intentions of being ahead in readings... and I always (somewhere after the first month) get completely behind in them all!  >O  Oh well, just gotta catch up maybe this weekend.  This Saturday I'll be going to Kerrville... to celebrate my Dad's birthday with my Grandma and everyone else.  Plans with Jamey to celebrate her 21st have been postponed.  Her parents are taking her out to dinner, and then by the time she's done with that Adrian's supposed to get off work and they were gonna go out.  We may do something the next weekend... may not.  Just depends on how things pan out.  She offered my coming along with her and Adrian... but I figure they probably REALLY wanna be alone.  Plus, I don't wanna watch them during their foreplay knowing that they'll end up shacking up after I'm gone and they're at his place.  ACK!  Other than that, not much is going on.  I talked to Mike for all of a few seconds to say "hello" and "goodbye" earlier today.  He's cute... and he's different, but he's not the type of person I wanna end up with... so I figure it's a waste of time to date him.  But, then again... only time will tell... and things could change.  Whatever... whatever happens shall happen!  :D  Okay... no more... I'm tired of updating today... I'll post later in the week...       urlLink  postCount('4Feb2003');

        Weekend Update...    Well, it's been an interesting weekend, I suppose.  Didn't do much of anything.  It's like, 1pm on Sunday already, and I haven't done anything, and probably won't do anything, so I decided I could post about my weekend now.  : )  Friday, I didn't do much of anything, really.  I went to class, then came home, ate some lunch, and then went on a LONG walk with my Mom.  Lasted about 1hr 15mins.  It was a good walk, and the last 15 minutes I jogged off an on, and came home feeling very energized.  Then I ate dinner with my parents, and we watched some tv, and then I went to bed (sorta early, actually).    Saturday was a pretty fun day (but slow starting to get to the fun part).  I had been bumming around the house all day, not doing much of anything.  Then WHAM-BAM I got a call from Jennifer!  YAY!  Calls from other countries are cool, and they make you feel very special.  We were just talking about anything and everything for about 40 minutes.  : )  It was good to hear from her... I had missed her a lot.  Then I watched tv a bit, and then I took a nap... then I got a call, and I couldn't fall back asleep, so I just got up.  I decided to take a shower, since I hadn't felt like it earlier that day.  Then as I was watching a movie on Oxygen,  Where The Heart Is  with Natalie Portman and Ashley Judd, Ricky called.  The movie was okay... all centered a lot around Wal-Mart, which was somewhat interesting.  Anyhow, when Ricky called me we were talking for a bit, and he was saying he was going to go to HEB or KMart for his Mom.  So, I went along with him (to HEB) and we had like, 3 or 4 things we had to get.  While we were there, we ran into Mrs. Etheredge from Roosevelt.  She was asking us how things were going with school and the like, and then she asked about Marta.  It was good seeing her, I guess.  Anyhow, so we went on to Ricky's, and his Mom made dinner, and we had some GOOD spaghetti!  YUM!  After we ate, Mike kept saying he wanted to watch Mr. Deeds.  Ricky didn't really wanna see it, and I didn't care... I had heard it was bad, but hadn't seen it so I was fine with watching it.  Wolf came over (he was in town as well).  So, we were watching Mr. Deeds and Druck finally called back, so we told him to come on over.  The movie was okay... but DEFINITELY not like the other Adam Sandler movies!  : (  I'd say that The Wedding Singer is my favorite Sandler movie.  "They were cooones!"  :-)  hehehe  We finished the movie, and then we watched Batman Beyond for an hour, and then we watched Southpark.  Then all of us were pretty tired, so we went on home.  I GOT MY CAKEPAN BACK!!!  : D  WOOHOO!      Tomorrow    Tomorrow I go to the Rodeo with my parents and uncle.  Ray Charles and Neal McCoy are the entertainment.  I think it'll be an experience.  I've never been to the SBC Center, and we're going to have those close box seats again.  Like always.  I actually think that we're going to be going to the Rodeo a second time this year!  My Dad's friend from work, Mr. Larned wanted to go, but he didn't want to go alone.  I've known him forever (since I was little)... and he's gone through a lot the past 2 years.  His wife just passed away at the end of the summer from a year long battle with cancer.  I was somewhat close to her, too.  She used to tell me stuff about teaching and such, and we had some good conversations.  I miss her, and it's sad to me that she's not around anymore.  And her death was pretty sudden.  I mean, she was diagnosed with cancer and told she'd have 6 months- 1 year.  And she passed just short of a year of being diagnosed.  There was nothing that could be done for her.  Anyhow, so we may go to the Rodeo with Mr. Larned sometime.  We'll see.      Frog Name   It's been decided that the frog tattoo on my right ankle will be named Dax.  Everyone seems pretty happy with that, so I dub thou "Dax the frog."  Okay, that's all for now... I'll post something after the Rodeo to either rant or rave about the SBC Center.  : )       urlLink  postCount('2Feb2003');

        WACKY WEDNESDAY    1. Poetry or prose?  Poetry 2. Funky modern art or the older, "classic" variety?  Classic 3. Sculptures or paintings?  Both 4. Theatre: exuberant musical or serious drama?  Exuberant Musical 5. Ballet or modern dance?  Ballet AND Modern Dance  :-) 6. Movies: major studio or indie?  Indie films are cool (like Memento and May) but I enjoy the major studio pictures as well 7. Authors: Shakespeare or Dr. Seuss?  Shakespeare 8. TV: PBS or A&E?  A&E 9. Music: Beethoven or Beatles?  I love both, though I'd choose the Beatles over Beethoven if I wanted to feel more carefree 10. Thought-provoking question of the week: You are a contributing member of your favorite art museum, and visit on a regular basis. They announce a new, temporary special exhibit by an artist surrounded by controversy...this person's work and/or political views offend you. Do you stop supporting the museum, or just stay away during the time the exhibit is there?  I'd just stay away... I wouldn't want to be hypocritical... and art by definition is a way to express thoughts/opinions freely... so it'd be stupid to stop supporting that just because I don't agree with what an artist thinks...

        SO SURPRISED!    I was very surprised about something that just happened!  Last night my Dad asked me when I had last heard from my friend Erika.  I told him I had emailed her a while ago, but she hadn't yet responded, and being that I figured that was for a good reason, I decided not to be persistent and let her get back to me when she could.  Then, to my surprise, today there was a letter from her in my mailbox!  It was so odd!!!  Anyhow, I sat down and wrote her a 5 page letter right then and there.  I was so glad to hear from her.  She moved back up into the Dallas area to be closer to her family because she had some medical problems.  Anyhow, she's doing better now.  She's living in Euless, TX in an apartment that she says is overpriced.. :-)  But she sounds like she's having a very good time being close to her family, and she's working at a pre-school.  Anyhow, she said she'd love for me to come visit... so I just may do that as soon as I'm done with finals..!  :-)  In the time buffer I have between end of long semester and getting a job and then starting summer classes.  We'll see... I also have to think about when I may be getting a visit from someone out of state... since there's a large possibility that will occur this summer... and my Mom couldn't be happier about that... haha  She's so funny!  Anyhow... I am LOVING my new room... it's like a breath of fresh air!  Well, that's all I have for now... I'll post more later once something happens that's worth posting... :-D

        Update about my room...    Well, my room is getting the finishing touches as we speak, and then by tonight I'll be moving back in...!  :-)  If I ever get a chance, I'll take a couple pictures of it when it's done and post them on here via a link to a website where I'll have them so ya'll can see.  I really like it!  Believe it or not, it actually makes my room feel colder... I guess because it tricks me into thinking I'm in some shade, or something... :-)  The colors are so lush... I can't wait to get all my stuff back in there tonight, and really make it look awesome...!!!  Anyhow, I'm off now with my Mom to get some fabric to finish my windows with... so I shall be off now... keep a look out for pictures...!  : D

Dial-up or high speed internet access?  HIGH SPEED... I could NEVER go back to dial-up 5. Small *family-only* wedding or large 200+ guest wedding?  Most likely large because I know so many people 6. Would you rather be the bridesmaid or the bride? (if you are a guy, substitute best man or groom)  I'd rather be the bride... because when it's the special day, I'd have less responsibility than a Bridesmaid (Maid/Matron of Honor) would. 7. AC/DC or ABBA?  AC/DC!!! 8. Roses or daisies?  Pink Roses 9. Trashy romance novels or classic literature?  Hehe...  Beauty's Punishment ... j/k!  I like both  ; ) 10. NEW! Thought-provoking question of the week...If you had to choose one...would you rather be blind or deaf? Why? I'd rather be blind... I don't think I could NOT listen to music.

And Now...    I'm going to start stuff in my room... Ricky thinks I'm going to be depressed... but I'm not!  This blue is a HAPPY blue!  :-)  Anyhow, my Dad and I patched the major cracks last night, so today I get to patch all the push pin and nail holes in the walls.  Oh, what fun!  :-\  And then I get to start painting today... WAHOO!!!

        Update    Well, I can offer a short update right now... I didn't have time earlier when I posted the Wacky Wednesday thing... Um, well, I've taken one test out of three this week.  It was in my music class... had all the music theory stuff in it, and I aced it!  WOOHOO!  I have a test today at 2 in my Early Childhood class.  Well, a quiz.  It's over one chapter... and I'm really not very worried about it, because we take it 2 times.  Once by ourselves, then another time (after discussing it) with groups.  So, then I'm coming home and I'm going to rest a bit, and then call Ricky and see if he wants to come to the Wednesday Lent service at my church since he's not doing anything else and has been bored this week.  Let's see... what else?  Oh!  I have my second proficiency tomorrow in music... all we have to do is play 2 songs on recorder... no piano stuff this time.  :-(  Darn!  After that class my Spring Break begins!!!  :-)  My Texas Politics professor said he wanted to start Spring Break early... so we don't have class Friday and that's my only class!  :-)  HOORAY!  Well, I have to go now, because I'm making ramen soup, and then I wanna go over stuff in my chapter to review for my quiz... :-P  P.S.- Do the WACKY WEDNESDAY!  : D  I'll post more when I have more time... I'll find a funny story to tell... ; )

        Stumped    I updated the links in the box above, and updated info on the side menu.  However, I'm incredibly stumped as to why Wolf and Druck's blog links are in purple... if anyone else sees them as different than the other links, lemme know... along with your theory of WHY they're like that.  :-)      Update    Okay... nothing else is really going on today.  Been doing laundry and some cleaning in my room and around the house.  I've also been picking exact colors to paint in my bathroom... I'm doing a faux finish... it should be fun and interesting.  In the meantime, my Dad asked me if I wanted to paint my room something else, and so I've decided that while in the painting and remodeling mood, that I should probably do it now.  So, I've decided on a navy blue for the walls, and for the baseboards and frame work a burgundy color.  Then the woodwork (like the window sills and the closet doors) will be a beige/light khacky color.  I'm also making a duvet for my bedspread instead of buying a completely new one or buying a duvet for like $60-120.  It's going to be navy blue, burgundy, gold and forest green.  I decided to use the primary colors in their darker shades.  My curtains are going to be a sheer burgundy color.  I'm excited to do this, because my room is long overdue for an updated look... and I'm growing quite tired of the blues, greens and lavenders.  My Mom's only concern was that the dark color on the walls would make my room look really small... but for anyone who's seen my room, they would know that's no big concern.  My room is very large.  The size of my parents master bedroom at our old house.  In addition to the painting in my room, we're going to paint in the living/dining room area.  My Dad is tired of patching and repatching cracks in the walls, so he's decided to put up wood paneling in the dining and living rooms.  Well, in the dining room it's really only going to be 3 walls, because the one wall has wallpaper that all of us are quite fond of (it's a beige/maroon/blue plaid).  So, we decided to do the other 3 walls in the dining room beige, and put a medium burgundy... borderline to plum on the living room walls.  Those rooms (since they are really more like one BIG room) are going to have wood floors.  Not only will we be painting this/these rooms... but my Dad said he wants a new color in their bedroom.  He wanted blue, my Mom doesn't.  Then she said she wanted this apricot color, and he turned his nose up at that.  So I have yet to find out what they put in there... but I think they've both sorta agreed on a peachy color.  I pointed out to them that with it on the walls, it's really going to look MUCH different than that.  Not as light, and since neither of them really like a LOT of color, I think it'll be just enough color for them.  Anyhow, I'm really excited, because I love painting.  I don't really like the moving furniture and taking everything off the walls and patching holes part... but, it will be worth it!    Another thing that they're talking about is finishing the clearing out of the patio room and putting a spa/hot tub in there.  We'll see what comes of that... but I wouldn't be all that surprised if the spa/hot tub ends up outside.  I think they may rethink it because they will realize there will always be puddles on the floor next to it in there.  Then maybe I can talk them into the idea I had of putting a pool table in there and making it a game room.  I think that'd be a better use for it... of course, it'd be really cold in there during the winter, because that room has to have its own heater... but still.  :-D  Okay... well, I've talked enough, and I must get back to the laundry and other chores for today.  Comment, comment!

        No More Zack Posts    I've decided there will be no more including Zack in my posts from here on out.  The reason this was decided is because I'm tired of being lectured by people... or having little comments made here and there regarding the friendship I have made with him.  It wouldn't normally bother me, except it seems a little hypocritical of some people to make jokes about someone I made friends with off the internet... especially considering his past... and future with this.  There's a comment on the last post to explain that comment.  Anyhow... on to brighter subjects...    Patty's Birthday!    Happy Birthday, Patty!  Saturday I went over to Ricky's to celebrate Patty's birthday.  We had a good time... It was good to see Trinity again, and good to spend time with Marta, Jeff, and Zoey.  :-)  We had barbecue, watched Trinity dance to Lilo & Stitch music, and then watched Spy Kids 2.  I don't remember why exactly we watched Spy Kids 2, because it wasn't any good.  But, yeah... we watched it.  I took a Marie Callendar's pie over for Patty... it's probably gone by now... and she made some bread pudding.  It was my first time to have it, and it was good...!  This is surprising to me, because I usually don't like rasins, but I liked this.  Even though Ricky and I found STICKERS in ours... apparently Mr. Ansley didn't take the stickers off the apples.  :-\  It was still good, though.  Sunday-Did a whole lot of nothing.  I slept in, I watched tv, I read a little bit... that's about it.    This Week    This week should be fairly easy.  I don't have any tests, or any projects or anything.  Which is nice, because from the looks of my syllabi, I won't have much to do before Spring Break.  :-)  I must say, I'm still quite upset that UT and UTSA don't have the same break...!!!  Oh, well... at least I'll have the weekend before or after to spend with Austin friends.  :-)  I was thinking of talking to Jamey and seeing what her spring break plans were.  I sorta wanna do some partying this break, but I don't know anyone of age, other than Jamey.  So I was thinking she and I could party.  I wonder if she's going to the coast.  If she is she's probably going with Adrian... and I'm NOT staying in the same hotel room as them...!  I don't want to hear the sex going on right next to me.  :-(  BLECH!  We'll see... I'll have to talk to her about it... Okay... not much else to say right now... but I'll post again later... probably on the comments, because I have a feeling there will be some lashing out by a certain someone who won't be too pleased with the anger I have for them due to their comment.  I know what's going to happen... I'm going to get a "Can't you take a joke?!?  GOD!!!"  but the thing is, it's just not funny... and this person has NO ROOM to joke about this topic... especially knowing how much flack I've gotten about this from 2-3 others.  Oh well...

        Light at the end of the tunnel?    I feel like I'm drowning.  I have so much stuff to do, it's ridiculous.  However, I see a glimmer of hope in this mess.  Last night (once I got my Dad outta the dining room from working) I sat down at the computer, and in 30 minutes time, I cranked out 2 pages of my term paper.  And this was just in my introduction and the biographical info on Atwood.  So, I think it's very possible that I will hit very close to 10 pages... and just as plausible that I'll EXCEED 10 pages by a bit.  However, sometime this weekend I have to get together with a couple members from my group in music class to paint the background for our play.  It's kinda elaborate, and we've definitely got our work cut out for us.  Then we have the play on Tuesday... the same day that my term paper is due.  And Weds. I have to turn in all the rest of my projects for my education class.  I think I've figured out how I'm going to do this.  Because it seems my Dad has decided this is the weekend that he wants to start working in the dining room.  Yesterday he ripped out the carpet, and started putting wood all over the ceiling because he's going to put something else up there so that cracks won't be visible and he won't constantly be repairing stuff.  This makes it incredibly hard to try and sit at the computer and type out my paper.  So, I've decided I'll work on the other projects I have to do during this time.  Then at least I can have them done.  I only have 3 things left to do... and really only 2.  I already have everything ready for my last book, I just need to print the stuff out, and put it in the folder thing.  So, I have to make my poster (educational one) and my other game.  I have no clue what other game I'm going to make, but I'll figure it out soon.  I should probably retype and print out a clean copy of the script for our play by tomorrow at the latest.  Because the professor has to have one.  In the meantime, I'm going to rest.... I'll be glad when this semester is over for good.

        WACKY WEDNESDAY!     Tests    1. Scantron or fill in the blank? Depends on the subject  2. Short answer or essay question(s)? Short answer  3. Difficult Open Book or Easy Closed Book? Easy closed book  4. 2 Tests (Midterm/Final) per semester, or several and a final? Several and a final  5. Term paper, project, or final? Project  6. All your finals at the beginning of the week, or spread out across the finals week? spread out so I can study  7. Dead days: Study or take a break? Take a break!!!  8. After finals: Party or sleep? Sleep  9. Summer classes: Take them or just take more during long semesters? Summer classes  10. Thought Provoking Question: If you noticed someone cheating on a final, what would you do? If they were still cheating when I turned in my exam, then I would probably say something to the Prof. as I turned in my exam. If they finished before me... I guess I'd hope the Professor is smart enough to notice them cheating...

        Wedding Bells Will Ring    Well, I have to say that I'm am one excited sister!  My brother bought the engagement ring yesterday, and I was the first family member to see it!!!  :-)  It's gorgeous!  It's a very good quality, 1/2 carat diamond solitaire ring.  It's so exciting... and what's even more exciting is that my brother will most likely be engaged in 2 weeks time!  :-D  Hooray...    Other News    Classes are coming to an end very quickly.  I'm thinking it may actually be a very real possibility that I make the Dean's List... and that pleases me a LOT.  Um, let's see..?  Yeah, I still haven't started my 10 page term paper.  But, I'm not all that worried about it.  I'm very familiar with the subject... so I will be fine.  As for my other classes.  In my music class, we have to put together a play.  Our group has decided to do the story of the 3 Little Pigs... but with a twist.  We're going to present it as a "Breaking News" story.  There will be a reporter, and she will interview the 3 little pigs, and the big bad wolf.  We're excited.  I'M excited too, because I get to compose all the music stuff.  :-)  YAY!  I've also had quite an interesting week.  I've totally aced all my music class stuff... my last quiz and proficiency.  I aced my World Lit quiz... and most likely the last one that I just took on Thursday.  I have one more paper to write and email to the prof by Tuesday at 5.  Then I get to work on all my stuff for other classes.  :-)  I'm so ready for classes to be over, because then I'm going to Port Aransas with the family, and I hope to come back home with a good looking tan, and a well-rested body...!!!  :-D  I don't start my summer classes til June 9, so that should give me a good amount of time to find and secure a job.  I was thinking of applying at a different daycare place, but only if I'm assured that I'll be in a classroom of preschoolers or kindergarten aged kids.  No more diaper changing for me.  :-)  And I was also thinking of getting a weekend job for the summer at that new place on Walzem "Firehouse Pub and Grill."  I figured I could make some good money in tips or something.  And I'd only do that during the summer.  But we'll see.  I mean, if I'm gonna get like, $7 an hour at a daycare (which is possible with my experience) then I may just do that.  :-)  Okay, that's all for now.  I'll post more another time.

        Ice Cream Days    In light of the fact that it's started heating up in Texas, I thought I'd ask about ice cream stuff... :-)  1. Chocolate or Vanilla?  Chocolate 2. Frozen Yogurt or regular ice cream?  I like both, but prefer regular 3. Sherbet or Sorbet?  Sherbet 4. Shake or Malt?  Malt 5. Smoothie or Slushie?  Slushie 6. Cone or bowl?  Usually bowl, but recently I've been craving a cone 7. Ice cream cones: Waffle or Wafer?  Waffle! 8. With sprinkles or without?  Without 9. Caramel or Hot Fudge?  Hot Fudge... or better yet... melted peanut butter and chocolate syrup 10. Sonic, Dairy Queen, or Baskin Robbins?  For good ice cream... Baskin Robbins... For slushies/banana splits... Sonic...  For blizzards... Dairy Queen.  :-)

        Inflatable castle wishes and hot dog dreams...?    Well, this weekend was Ricky's little cousin, Trinity's, birthday party.  She turned 3, and well, the party was fit for a little princess and her court.  :-)  She got one of those jumping castles, which by the way is NOT made for tall people!!!  Her party was themed with Hello Kitty, and she got lots of items for her new "house," which is out back.  Oh man... she is SO pampered!  She has this little playhouse in the backyard, and it's all landscaped around it.  They're going to put in a pond and a little stream (which already has a cute little bridge over where it's going to be), and lots of pretty flowers and rock-work around the trees forming planters.  Oh my gosh...!  It's not even fathomable to me that someone could have it so good at age 3...!!!  What's even MORE unbelievable is that lots of the play appliances she got for her house are POTTERY BARN!!!   I  don't even have Pottery Barn stuff...!!!  Haha... We had a fun day... the kids played DDR... we were there all day.  After all the other people left and the only kid left was Trinity; Ricky, Wolf, and I jumped into the castle with her.  It was SO FUNNY!  She'd run out, and then Ricky and Wolf would act like they were going to "get me."  Trinity would run in and she'd growl at them, yelling "Leave my Kelsie alone!"  One time she TOTALLY lunged at them, throwing herself across the castle at them to save me, then she ran over to my side, patting me and hugging me saying, "It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.  I got you, I got you, I got you..."  hehe  It was the cutest thing I've EVER heard.  Well, aside from her yelling at me from the castle earlier in the day, "Kelsie, come here!!!  Don't you LOVE ME anymore?!?!"  Damn you, Ricky!  Damn you to HELL!  Other than that, not much has gone on.  My brother's coming in town on Thursday for Easter weekend.  My little cousin Travis had surgery this morning... he's doing good.  I'm anxiously awaiting the end of classes.  :-)  I just want it to be over.  So far I'm pulling 4 A's and one B.  If my final grades reflect this, then I'll make the Dean's List.  That is a VERY exciting prospect...!!!  Hmmm... OH!  I STILL haven't started on my 10 page term paper for World Lit... hehe  It's due in about 2 weeks... hehehe  I'll get it done eventually.  What else?  Oh, the new template... it'll be on here eventually... maybe by this weekend...?  We'll see... Depends on how much time the HTML Genius has this week.  Anyhow, now I must jet, I shall post something later (most likely for the Wacky Wednesday).

        Facelift... coming soon    I've decided this blog needs a facelift... It's spring... I got a new dress for Easter... It's just time to do away with the boring green template.  I'm still going to have like, my little froggies dancing, etc.  BUT, the background and all HAS to change.  I've collaborated with Ricky (the HTML genius) and I decided on a new template.  It's so pretty....!  Be on the lookout.  Now I'm going to go and take care of the new fishies we got today (since one of our other schoolers died) and later I'm going to plant my plants in the UTSA colored pots I got... (an orange one and blue one).  Yay... I'm so happy!!!  I missed planting stuff... flowers are wonderful.  I also have to wrap Trinity's birthday gift.  I think this is going to be a good weekend... and then my brother's coming on Thursday... and he's going to pick out an engagement ring for his soon-to-be fiancee!  So much stuff is going on in my life right now..!!!

        Greetings from Austin    Well, here I am... 10:30am on a Saturday morning, and I can't sleep anymore... it's been so hot in Ricky's apartment, because their A/C doesn't seem to be working.  So, last night we opened all the doors and windows.  Well, his window is open, and so I've heard every person that has come or left this apartment building at Sterling... : (  Anyhow, we had a good time last night for the most part.  We went to TCGC (Texas Color Guard Circuit) State Championships.  Anyhow, we got inside JUST in time to catch the tailend of the group performing before Nelson.  They were okay.  Then Nelson's group came on.  They were better than that group (which was Bowie HS).  Nelson's theme was math.  It was interesting to see what he had done with the theme.  Anyhow, after him was Connally HS... this is a group that used to find OUR group at contests just to tell us how 'cool' they thought our shows were.  They always had mediocre shows back then, but have since done a LOT to make themselves better.  Well, their show theme was "Signs," music from the movie.  Oh, man!  That show was incredible...!!! It actually freaked me out a little bit the way the girls were dancing like the aliens moved.  EEP! Anyhow, then we saw some other school (Tomball, I think) do Velocity, which was odd.  They didn't do as good a  job with it as TR did, though!!!  Their costumes were less interesting... and THEY didn't have HUGE green poles!!!  Hehe  The next 'class' was the one TR was in.  We saw Elkins HS, and after their opener we all just sorta looked at each other with VERY worried expressions.  We kinda knew at that point that TR would probably take 2nd.  So, then TR comes on... and it's basically a HUGE embarrassment.  The only up to their performance was that they looked like they were having fun.  Well, so after all the groups performed and we went down closer for the retreat (the awards ceremony) we went and talked to Nelson.  It was good to see him again... and then later after the retreat when we were leaving he almost left his youngest boy Carter!  So, we started back to the car, and as we were walking in front of the building I say outloud... "Man, I have a wedgie..."  At this point, Ricky almost PICKED my wedgie!!!  HAHA  I'm glad he realized what he was about to do voluntarily before he actually DID it... because I would've really freaked out if I would've felt Ricky's fingers pulling out MY wedgie.  HEHE  It's good to know, however, that if I had no hands and couldn't pick my wedgies, all I'd have to do is call Ricky... : D  Well, I think I'll end this post on that note, and I'll post more later on... probably after I go work at the child care "money" office on Monday... :-)  Til next time...

        WACKY WEDNESDAY     Food Colors   1. Green or Purple Ketchup? Green 2. Blue or Pink Butter? Blue 3. Blue or Red tortilla chips? Red 4. Syrup: Clear red or stay the same? Clear red!  It'd be like blood... mmmm 5. Mayo: Black or white? I still say Black would be cool... think of how unnerved people would be 6. Mustard: Glow in the dark or brown? GLOW IN THE DARK, all the way! 7. Bread: Orange or Magenta? Magenta 8. Oatmeal: Neon Green or Neon Pink?  Neon Green 9. Orange Juice: Make it blue or keep it orange?  Hmmm... Blue... think of the irony 10. Thought Provoking Question:  If you were told by a friend that they were cheating on their significant other, would you tell their significant other or leave it alone taking the "ignorance is bliss" stance?  I would tell my friend's significant other that they were being cheated on... because I know what it's like to be cheated on, and wouldn't want anyone else to go through that...

        Update...    Well, I really haven't been doing anything all that productive.  :-(  I'll get around to the important stuff next week.  I have to call my advisor and schedule a meeting, and I also have to contact the people in the Fine Arts dept. to go and get the paper work rolling for my minor in music so that I can sign up for the classes I need this coming semester.  I start my first summer session on 9 June.  :-(  I have an 8am class, but I figure, it's only for 4 weeks, and I have to get some classes out of the way.  Gotta get them done.  Okay, so, school stuff is going to get done pretty quickly next week.  I also have to find a job.  I want to get a job with a child care place... but I'm kinda picky about it.  I wanna get paid at least $6, because I have experience... I also want to only work with kids 4 and up.  I don't wanna do the diaper stuff again this summer.  So, probably Monday and Tuesday of next week will be spent calling a few places inquiring about job openings.  I'll fill out applications.  I only hope I'll have the same luck I had when I got hired at Crestview.  I mean, I got called right away saying I got the job.  :-)  Anyhow....  In other news, I'm not talking to my Dad.  It's been a whole week today.  I think I deserve an apology... and I've decided that since it looks like I won't be GETTING an apology.. I may just decide to bury the hatchet... but of course, I WILL NOT say sorry to my Dad (because I didn't do anything wrong) and I will tell him that he should have apologized to me, because he jumped all over me for no reason... blowing a minor situation completely out of proportion.  Also, things are moving along with my brother's wedding and reception plans.  I think I'll be making some decorations in the not-so-far future.  I have to call him this weekend and see if he'd like me to do anything.  :-)  The wedding will be 30 Aug... and the reception will be 13 Sept.  Other news:  The rennovations are coming along quite nicely.  Thru no help by me, my Dad has finished painting in the dining room.  Have fun, Dad.  I did my fair share of painting when I painted my room... and I still have the bathroom to do.  I figure it's no big deal to paint the bathroom... I'm doing it for my Mom.  She likes to have a nice-looking house.  Anyhow, the flooring has been put in... more paneling will be going up soon (in the living room).  Then there will be more painting.  I'll be glad when it's all done (and I'm sure my Mom will,too) because then we get to decorate.  :-D  We're getting a new slipcover for the couch in the living room so it'll match... my Mom's getting new curtains... we have a  urlLink new rug  on the way in... and it looks SO COOL!  I can't believe I talked my Mom into it... it's very much a contemporary rug, and I thought she'd go for the much more boring pattern.  But she picked the one I liked....  That's all for now... more later... ; )

        Wacky Wednesday!!!    This n That  1)  Clay or Ruben (American Idol Winner)?  CLAY 'all the way' Aiken!!! 2)  Throw rocks at boys, or not?  Throw rocks at the jerks, commend the non-jerks 3)  Rogue or Jean Grey?  Rogue 4)  Matrix Reloaded or X2? X2 5)  Mr. Sinus or Open Screen Night?  Mr. Sinus... though I'll never forget Ricky's debut as an exhibitionist!  ;) 6)  Thought provoking question:  What would YOU do for a Klondike bar?  I think the farthest I'd go is flashing my boobs for a Klondike bar, but unless I was in the middle of a bout with hypoglycemia, I don't know if I'd go much further than saying "please?"

        Jerks should DIE!    Well, let's see... it's been an interesting couple of days.  Ya know how a while ago Alexis said we should throw rocks at boys...??  Yeah, I have joined the ranks, and feel this is only APPROPRIATE for jerks... they know who they are.  There's a link on the side to a picture that is sure to bring a smile onto ANYONE'S face... even the guys'.  Enjoy!

        After reading Alexis's blog...    I took the happy bunny quiz.  Here's my results:    congratulations. you are the kiss my ass happy bunny. You don't care about anyone or anything. You must be so proud    urlLink   which happy bunny are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      And now for an update...    Port Aransas was wonderful!  We stayed at a condo place called Cline's Landing... it's about 4 blocks from the ferry port, and our balcony/patio looked out into the ship channel.  So, we saw lots of huge ships and little boats.  However, the coolest thing that we saw was dolphins.  Yep, we have dolphins in our Gulf waters, and we would see dolphins all day everyday, in the water right beneath our balcony.  At one point, we saw about 9 dolphins at once (and I mean, they all surfaced at the same time, so there's no chance we counted the same 2-3 dolphins several times).  It was fun to watch them... and every time a big ship would come through the channel, they'd go out and play in the water that they'd push in front of their crafts.  It was at this time that we realized there were some baby dolphins, too.  They'd jump completely out of the water, and they were just as cute as they could be.  I went out to the pool a lot, and on the beach a couple times, and so I got a bit darker.  :-)  We had a great time.  The only complaint I had is that my Grandma, being the older woman she is, is set in her ways, and she says some things that REALLY upset me.  Yep... racist things.  In addition to bugging me by doing this, she started in on me about every last detail of "Ricky" and would really start to get on my nerves by saying at LEAST once every waking hour that we should get married.  OY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I also had to sleep in the same room with her a couple nights... she snores... a lot.  And, as if she didn't talk enough during the day... she talks in her sleep.  One night, she made a sound like a ghost would make... "Wooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo."  It scared the SHIT out of me!  Anyhow...  We got back home yesterday, and we had already gotten tickets for the James Taylor concert at Verizon Wireless Amphitheater.  It was HELL getting onto Lookout Rd. and it was MORE Hell once we got off the access road and started down Lookout.  Fortunately for us, my Uncle Scott drives his little BMW like Mel drives her Corolla... he zipped past a bunch of people in the right lane (the WRONG lane) and then cut in front of some guy in the left lane.  We finally parked, and it was like, 8:10pm... James Taylor was supposed to start at 8... I'm glad that he didn't, because we got out of the parking lot and up near the front, and there was a LONG line forming to get into the show...  Well, anyhow... we got in, found our seats... and James came out about 10 minutes later.  He gave an AWESOME show... he did 3 encores... the last of which was Sweet Baby James.  If you've never heard it... it's a sweet song.  He is a much smarter man than I would've guessed.  He played all of his new stuff first... then played his older stuff at the end.  Oy... anyhow... there were some younger couples sitting next to my Dad.  And they collectively had about 14 beers.  Now, if you've been to Verizon, you KNOW that those beers are big... they aren't just whimpy cups.  Anyhow, they were VERY drunk by the end of the show... and for one of the songs, they stood up and were dancing around.  Some man behind us was yelling at them to sit down.  The very drunk guy that was sitting right next to my Dad turned around and said, "Stand up!!!"  Oh my... they exchanged some words... while we sat there afraid we'd get beer slung in our direction or something.  It was a bit scary... because the guy that was behind us and very angry... he wasn't a small man.    Well, that was my week and concert experience.  I'm glad to be home... I'm glad my Grandma's going home today... and I'm glad that I had a good time at the James Taylor concert w/o getting beer all over me.  I'll post something later!

        TGIF!    I'm so glad that it's Friday... but I was really thankful on Wednesday, because I was completely done with this semester!!!  My politics final went surprisingly quick, and I feel like I got at the least a B.  I don't know... I don't need much to maintain a B, and if I got an A then I most likely got an A in the class.  I don't know if I made the Dean's List.  I'll let ya'll know... but I had to pull an A in either my Politics or Education class (instead of the high B I had in each class).  I don't know if I did that, because I only really studied enough to maintain the grades that I had... as opposed to trying really hard to make an A on the final and in the class.  I'll be happy with 3 A's and 2 B's, to be quite honest.  Okay, what else am I happy about?  This time tomorrow, I'll be soaking up the sun in Port Aransas, TX... playing lotsa guitar, bumming around, and just getting in a good week long vacation before I search for a job and then have summer classes the months of June and July.  Zack may come this summer for a visit, which will be quite interesting... :-)  Oh, some creepy guy from sims online sent me a message.  BLECK!  Yeah, and I think that Joe may have called me last night like, 3 times in a row.  I  think .  I dunno, I hope not, but he ran into my Mom on Weds. at Wal-Mart... so I wasn't all that surprised when I got several phone calls from a blocked number.  Ya know what I hope?  I hope he decides to give me my stuff back... and my Mom thinks that I should call his mommy and ask her to get onto him about it.  I don't think it's too much to ask.  I just don't want him to have things sitting around that carry my name on them, because then he may get the brilliant idea (in one of his fits of self-pity) to gimme a call and play "sad Joe" trying to get sympathy.  Sympathy which I don't have the time or want to give him.  Ever.  The only other time I want to have anything to do with him is to get my stuff back... and then that's it.  I don't care anymore... and I have lots of non-loser people to give the time of day to.  People that actually care about me, and people whom I regard more as family than just friends.  They know who they are...  Okay, well, I don't feel like posting much else, because I still have to take a shower and such... getting ready for that damned fashion show I'm modeling in tonight... yuck!  I don't feel like it... but it should be fun... Jamey's in it with me... we always have fun together... ; )  hehehe  I dunno... if Ricky wants to call and inquire about whether or not we're engaging in a wrestling match in a salad dressing filled pool... hehehe... go right on ahead.  It's no worse than asking me and Christine if we were finger painting each other when we were painting a backdrop for our play.  hehehe  :-D  Okay, kiddies... I probably won't update again til after I get back from Port A.  But, we'll see... my Uncle Scott will probably bring his laptop, and I think we'll have web access in the condo.  Bye bye til I'm back...

Pool... it's too hot and humid in the TX coast (or any coast for that matter) to get into a hot tub! 6.  Question:  Do you care that I'm so pre-occupied with finals and getting ready to go on a vacation to Port Aransas, TX that I only gave you 6 things to answer for Wacky Wednesday???  I don't care... I have TOO MUCH other stuff going on to worry about coming up with a 10 question Wacky Wednesday post this week... now I have to go to campus and get ready for my politics final... blech!

      I'd also like to note that I find it very funny my "Violent" nature was very high.  It's funny, because this past weekend, I tried to come off as a non-violent person... and I'd like to believe in comparison to Mike that I'm not... but it was so funny because he was like, "You're kidding, right?!  You've gotten REALLY violent with me before!!!  You ARE violence..."  and he, Ricky, and I just laughed really hard, because... it's true.  I'm friggin' violent when I get pushed past the breaking point.  Maybe that's why I like the Limp Bizkit song, "Break Stuff."  :-)

        Busy busy busy    Well, it's crunch time.  This coming week is the last week of the first summer session.  :-)  I'm ready to be done with this class, but at the same time I'm going to miss it.  We honestly had a lot of fun in there.  Lots of group activities, and projects.  Oh well, a lot of the people in my class are taking the Children's Lit class with me next session.  :-D  So, that's the reason I haven't posted in a long time.  I've been very busy.  Typing out papers, creating projects, studying for tests.  I should make an A in the class unless I totally flub any of my other observation papers.  Let's see... not much else is going on.  I'm going to Austin tonight to Mr. Sinus with peoples.  It's the last night for Terminator... :-)  Oh, the ex is being incredibly annoying lately.  He keeps IMing me and calling me... I think he's trying to annoy me to the point that I just date him again to get him off my back.  It won't happen.  I don't have any feelings for him anymore.  I'm totally apathetic when it comes to him.  I don't have feelings of like or dislike... just feelings of annoyance.  ;)  Anyhow... OH!  I'm officially a Music Minor at UTSA now.  :-D  I get to start taking all my music theory classes next semester.  And band.  ICK.  But the upside is that I may not have to audition, depending on how many people they have that are going to play clarinet.  I need to call Dr. Williams on Monday or Tuesday and find out.  Actually, I could email him.  I think that Dr. Davis said that'd probably be a better idea, especially if he doesn't plan on being in his office much until later in the summer.  Okay... well, I must go now.  I need to take a shower, and then go over to H&H Music in the Forum shopping center.  I have to check about a clarinet.  I found a really good LeBlanc Clarinet that's overstocked right now.  They're selling them at 59% off!  So instead of paying near to $4,000... I'd only have to pay $1500.  But I'm checking with H&H to see if they'd cut me a better deal than that.  If they don't, then I'll get the other one.  :-)  Okay... now I go... I'll try and post again soon.

        The Long Awaited Update...    Well, I've been pretty busy lately.  That being why I haven't updated in awhile... I started classes on 9 June (Monday) and I realized I was going to have a crappy first session.  :'(  I had a Child Growth and Development (Early Childhood) class at 8am, and a Cognitive and Language Development class (also Early Childhood) that was at 11.  Well, UTSA made a booboo for the first class.  They gave it the times that a 5-week class would have, and it's a 4-week class.  So, we were going to be short by hours in the end.  The professor's remedy was to switch the class to 7:30am.  Oh what fun.  Well, I mean, I knew that we would have "group papers" due every Monday (4 of them, 3 pages, single spaced...)  and on Monday he had told us that the tests we'd have every Monday would be 20 questions.  Well, someone asked again on Tuesday about that, and he let us know that those tests would be 20 questions per chapter.  We were supposed to read 4 chapters each week.  I dropped the class on Tuesday when I got home from class.  Reason being, my other early childhood class has all these observation things we have to do, PLUS projects and tests.  And, I knew that it'd, content-wise, be easier in a 4 week period.  So, I kept it and dropped the other.  I'm pissed though, because the professor for the Growth and Development class should've told us what he told us Tuesday on MONDAY... then at least people could've gotten a 100% refund for the class.  Oh well... With the 9 hours I was going to take, it brought me one credit short of being a Senior... so, it's not like it was the difference between being a senior or junior.  I need to go to the offices for Interdisciplinary Studies and Music this week sometime... I have to redeclare my major and set up a time with my advisor, and I need to declare my minor in music so I can sign up for classes.    Whew... so that's school stuff.  Well, not all of it, I have a Children's Literature course next session.  I'm excited about it, though.  :-)  Okay, so... in other news... our remodeling stuff is about 50% done (in the living room).  The Dining room is done... and the living room will probably get done this week... by next weekend...?  Yeah... it will be.  I haven't talked to Zack that much lately... I've been busy... he's been busy.  He's like what I want in a husband... but I doubt he WILL be my husband.  He's too far away... and I don't foresee him moving, because he's too close to his family.  It's fine with me... my prince is out there somewhere.  Maybe I'll follow in Alexis's shoes and find someone here close to me... but I'm not all that ready for a serious relationship right now.  Next semester is going to be crazy for me... it's probably better that I don't have to worry about a boyfriend.  Oh... speaking of boyfriends... or dating people, actually... yeah, Joe IMed me last night... and I will be getting my stuff back this week.  We actually had a decent conversation... there were no pointed or mean statements thrown at each other.  I don't know that I could ever be really good friends with him... but at least I know I can be civil with him... and at least deem him as an acquaintance.    Oh... only one other thing to tell about.  Seeing that the Atkins diet works gave me motivation to give it a whirl.  I started on Monday... and I've lost 8 pounds... and an inch off my waist, hips, thighs, and upper arms.  And that's an inch on each section.  So, I guess it does work.  I wanted to lose some pounds before my brother's wedding.  So far, so good.  Oh yeah, and I got a call back from the childcare place I put an application in at.  I'm supposed to have an interview this Thursday.  I'm thinking it'll mostly be to iron out details.  I'm probably over-qualified for the job.  But I have to make sure I get to work with school-aged kiddos, and that I get paid at least $6/hr.  :-)  Yeah, I'm demanding... but I have all my CPR/First Aid certifications up to date, and I have experience in childcare.  Anyhow... I must go now, because I have a project to get done for my class tomorrow along with studying for the test.  :-)  I'll try and post as often as I can.  Adios til then...!!!

        T-3 and spiffyness    Yesterday I went with Ricky and Druck to see T-3.  It wasn't nearly as crappy as I thought it'd be.  I think some stuff was entertaining because I kept hearing jokes from Mr. Sinus's Terminator.  ;)  "Okay, the director told me to look right.... and then left...." (in Arnold's voice).  ;)  I do have to agree with Ricky... at many points it was obvious they were trying to see how much stuff they could smash and destroy.  But, it was actually pretty cool.  I didn't like the ending though... it seemed TOO happy an ending.  Anyhow, after that we went back to Ricky's... and we were there for awhile.  Then we went over to Jennifer's for a few minutes... and then we went back to Ricky's.  We watched May... but Druck left partway through it.  He said he wanted to be able to fall asleep early... LIAR... I heard him sign on after I got home from Ricky's!!!  :-)  Anyhow... what's up for today?  I need to go get low carb friendly groceries at Sun Harvest.  :-\  Not looking forward to doing THAT on a Saturday.  Anyhow, I'll post more later if anything happens.

        Better today    I went to Canyon Lake with Melissa today.  We had a pretty good time.  The swimming beach was surprisingly refreshing.  The water wasn't cold at all, it was just the right temperature.  The only icky things were:  walking through mud near the shore to get to the packed down part and the deeper water, and some creepy guy that was looking at Melissa and me smearing sun block on.  When the latter happened, we moved down shore quite a bit to try and get out of his sight.  It was gross!  Anyhow, other than that... nothing else happened today.  Had a good time with Melissa, though... wish that others could have come along.  Anyhow, on a sad note, Jamey won't be taking American Sign Language with me... :-(  Oh well... we're going to meet up on campus now that we'll both be in the same place... and she's now Hellbent on finding my Mr. Right.  haha  It's so cute.... but Jamey IS (after all) one of the people that knows me best.  So, it's cool.  Anyhow... not much more to say right now except... BOYS ARE STUPID... THROW ROCKS AT THEM!!!!!!  (Damn you Richard Biggs!  How do you feel about YOUR impending trip to Hell?!?!)

        I'm messed up...    And that title's no joke.  I'm an emotional wreck.  Why?  Don't get me started... don't EVEN get me started.  This all roots back to a bad part of my life which I'm trying desperately to forget... unfortunately that "bad part" reared its ugly head, and caused me to think about things that I haven't thought about for the past 9 months.  I'll be okay eventually... it's just going to take time.  Fortunately, I have good friends who have given me their perspectives on things... and while I sorta wish that it hadn't come about the way it did... in the long run it will be effective and helpful.  So... on to happier things...    Yesterday I got the new  urlLink 311  cd.  It's okay... not the same as the other ones, though.  It's not as energetic and in-your-face, but I think it may partly be because I haven't listened to it enough to really get into the songs.  What did I do today?  HAHAHA  Excuse me, but I had to laugh because I didn't do much of anything.  I woke up at like, 12:30... I talked to my Mom about the aforementioned "bad part" of my life... cried a lot... went back to sleep... woke up... talked to Melissa... worried that Jennifer was mad at me... called her to talk about it... cried on the phone (which was embarrassing, because I hate crying in front of people... or having people hear me cry... but I just couldn't help it this time)... got things with that all sorted out, though... and well... then I ate, because my Mom had been bugging me all day to eat something and I figured I probably should.  Yep... what a great day, right?   Tomorrow... me and Melissa (and hopefully Jennifer, too) are going to  urlLink Canyon Lake  for a while.  Probably not a LONG time, because well... eh.  Then, I don't know what we're doing afterwards tomorrow night... we'll just see.  I'm hoping that the more I do, the less time I'll have to think about other stuff... and hopefully that'll turn out well.  Anyhow, I don't have anything else to post right now... I'm just hoping everything gets better by next week.  I'd hate to have a crappy birthday because I'm wallowing in sadness about this whole thing.

        Birthday...    The question has been asked about what I want for my birthday.  Well, I've decided that it actually may be easier for people (since apparently I can be a somewhat difficult person to shop for) if I make a 'wish list.'  So, I'll prepare a list of dvds that I don't have, but want, etc. for the people who are planning on getting me something.  I'll give it to someone in the group and they can choose, mark it off, and pass it on to the next person.  Deal?  Okay... :-D

        Whoa    Why is it that people always realize that they had something great AFTER they lose it?  Things have been really crazy lately.  I've had training this week... it's going okay.  The instructor/training guy has been flirting with me a tad.  It's fun to flirt.  I won't have anything the next 2 weeks... then the first 2 weeks of August will be spent going to classes for more training hours for my job.  :)  Oh the fun of summer.  Um, other than that... my 22nd birthday is coming up... July 29th... mark it on your calendar... it's going to be a fun day I hope.  Hmmm... Also, I'm going to the Warped Tour tomorrow... after training  :'(  I hope I don't miss good bands.  Then on Saturday me and my bro are going to see Dave Matthews Band.  :-D  It's going to be great.  There goes my paycheck for training.  :-\  I guess I'll post more later... it could be an interesting night.

        Interesting...    What's interesting, you ask?  Having my friends know what "type" of guy that I like.  Weird.  Jennifer and Ricky think that a guy they work with (whom they refer to as "Scruffy Nick") is the perfect guy for me.  Well, not perfect, but someone who I'd take interest in.  I'm finding this odd.  Especially since Ricky couldn't really TELL me what qualities he thinks I think are important in a guy I'd date.  Anyhow, me and Jennifer went into Toys R Us today to go see Ricky and Druck, and so she could write their schedules down.  It was fun stuff...  I'm not supposed to reveal any details from while we were there... even though I think they're cute.  Okay, so... Jennifer's probably going to go to Warped Tour with me and Melissa... because Amy wants to go to the Paul Oakenfold rave that's going to be here on Tuesday night.  I decided not to go to the rave, because I'd rather use my money that I make tomorrow and Tuesday (from training) to buy t-shirts at the Warped tour AND at DMB... because I'm going to the concert on Saturday with my brother.  :-)  Yay... good times.  Anyhow... that's all for now... we're going to T-3 tonight... :-D  Good stuff.

        YAY!    Melissa's home from Italy...!  :-)  It's been raining today... a lot.  I hope it doesn't flood again... :-\  Other than that I'm happy, because Dell fixed my drive problem today.  The CD Burner wasn't reading or writing.  So, a computer guy came out and he swapped my drive for a brand new one.  :-)  It works again... probably better than the other one.  :-)  Anyhow, Melissa and Jennifer should be here in a bit, and we're going to do something... I dunno what... but something.  Jennifer wants to go over to Geoffrey's Toys R Us.  Dunno if I wanna go... what with the rainy roads and all... and I'm not exactly feeling up to visiting with a bunch of strangers.  I wouldn't mind seeing Druck and Ricky, though.  Anyhow... more later...  ;)

        Hideaway...    Well, I love my family and all... really, I do.  But when holidays come around, and I have to spend time with them... well, CERTAIN members... I just want a place to hide.  I love being around my cousins, they make me laugh, and well, they're just cute.  And their mom (my older cousin) has always been someone that I love to girl talk with.  Now, as for the elders (minus my uncle, because he's just friggin' awesome) I could do with just talking to them for like, 20 minutes.  I think I may have to hide from my Grandma.  The last time that I was with her for a long time (vacay in the Port Aransas) she drove me crazy.  Those of you whom I speak to often know why.  I just sorta don't want to be around on Friday.  I wish that my cousins weren't coming here and that I was just going to go over there and spend the whole day there.  Oh well.  Where did this erupt from?  Well, I have no school on Fridays... my final is tomorrow.  I casually mentioned that I may wanna sleep in... like... without being woken up by anyone or an alarm.  I got my head bit off because I should be up for when the early birds (the old people) get here.  Jeez... is it too much to ask to sleep in til 10 am?  That's the latest I can sleep in anyway.  I just want to sleep til 10.  Oh well... Other than that, I'm doing good.  I'm going to get an A in my class.  There's no way for me to get less than that now... I could even not study, get a 7 out of 30 on the test and still get an A.  :-)  Comforting.    Let's see... oh yes.  The dreaded ex has been around again.  That's... interesting.  When I say around, I don't mean physically... I mean... via internet and telephone.  Hmmm... really not much else going on.  Oh, I most likely have a job lined up for the Fall and Spring semesters.  I had an interview with San Antonio Urban Ministries.  They're a non-profit organization that has a program called After School Kare (ASK) at several Northside schools.  So, if I get the job, I'll be working someplace very close to the UT-SA 1604 campus.  I even have a UNIFORM for this job.  And the plus is that I won't have to change diapers!  :-)  Anyhow, I'll post once I hear something about that.  More later...

He's really anxious... he's called the house pretty much everyday for the past two weeks... my Mom asked him if he had 'cold feet.'  I don't think he ever answered her.  ; )  Anyhow, I will be back on Sunday... which will be good, because then I can enjoy the rest of my 'weekend' at home, and sleep in on Monday for a change!  :-)  Talk to ya'll later...

        WAVERUNNERS!!!    Yesterday Ricky, Mike, Jennifer, Melissa, and I went waverunning at Canyon Lake.  It was awesome!  Unfortunately for me, I only got to ride for 30 minutes because I started getting a headache... but the 30 minutes I was riding were absolutely awesome!!!  We all wanna go do it again... and actually Ricky and I were looking at used waverunners for sale on Ebay.  Hehehe  They're expensive... but we were thinking if we split the cost of one that'd be awesome!  Dude... Mike is a crazy guy behind the steering handles of the wave runner!  It was fun, though.  Our waverunner (the 3 seater) tipped over 2 times... that guy told us the 3 seater wouldn't tip over... he SO lied to us!  Twas interesting getting back onto the waverunner, though... my first attempt took me awhile... I did better with my second time getting back on, I think.  At least it was more entertaining for Mike and Ricky to see.  hehe  ; )  Everyone who was there knows what I'm talking about.  Poor Mikey got a big knot on his head from the back end of the waverunner hitting him in the head when he had fallen off....  Oy!  As for me, I got misc. bruises on my legs and a couple scrapes... but nothing that wouldn't provide an awesome story and memory.  The whole time we were riding Ricky kept yelling, "There's a boat!  Somebody help them... PLEASE!!!"  It was hilarious!  Anyhow, tomorrow is my first day of classes... and I'm not looking forward to it at all... but at least I can rest assured that work will probably go more smoothly.  :-)  I'm growing to love the kids already... they're just so fun!!!  So, I go to class from 8-noon... and then I work from 2:15-6:15pm... I can't wait to tell Greg about my Canyon Lake weekend... he'll think it's funny... especially if I show him my 'battle wounds.'  Anyhow, that's all for now... anyone who wasn't with us this weekend missed out big time, man!!!  Maybe next time, eh...?

        Back in the saddle again...    Lucky me who gets to stress myself out the week before my classes start.  :-)  We started at our site for ASK on Monday.  Monday was the worst day, but we expected that.  We only have 3 vet ASK staff... all the rest of us are new... and on Monday we were short staffed because one of our gals had foot surgery on Saturday (because of some accident).  So, we don't know when she'll be back to work.  :-(  In the meantime, this makes things hard for us!!!  Our groups are all capped for ratio... even Greg has to jump into ratio, and he's not even supposed to.  However, I've been lucky with the kids in my group.  All but one are absolute delights.  They're all very helpful, and we had fun yesterday, and look forward to it today!!!  Hopefully we can actually follow our lesson plan for today, but that all depends on whether or not we can get our groups together more quickly and through bathroom breaks more quickly so we have more outside time.  Anyhow... tonight we're all going out to eat for Ricky's birthday.  I don't know where we're going... but somewhere we shall go.  :-)  So, that is what I'm doing after work... I'm probably just going to bring a change of clothes along with me and change at Ricky's before we leave for dinner.... otherwise it'll take me forever and a day to change at home and make my way over there eventually.  OH YEAH... and we're getting new windows.  Today is the second day that the workers have been here, and it should be done today.  SHOULD be....  They look nice... much different than the piece of crap windows that were in there before.  Hopefully it'll help out our AC/Heating bills.  :-)  Anyhow... off I go... I need to start getting ready for work, and then eventually leave here to work my ass off today...

        Well here I am. I don't know how to say this. The only thing I know is awkward silence.    That's not at all true, actually... but I figured that Mel-dawg would appreciate my tribute to Saves The Day.  :-)  I'm currently at Melissa's apartment... we came up to Austin today, because we found out that the They Might Be Giants movie is still playing here at Dobie.  :-)  YAY!  So, we get to see it together IN THE THEATER afterall!  Aside from being here, I'm having a good time doing stuff for work.  :-)  Training has become really fun!!!  I get to see Nick all the time, and flirt a lot... and Greg as well... though, even if I COULD date Greg (he's my direct superior... so it's against handbook rules) I wouldn't... He's really fun though... we laugh so much... it's great... As for Heather... I'm not caring too much to work with her for the next year.  :-(  Oh well, maybe it'll get better, especially since Mr. Henry (He's the Site Manager for our Region) gave a lecture to us today in our region meeting about not acting better than our fellow workers because we should be a small family... a team (for those of us who are competitive).  I hope that the year will go well, though I'm sure it will because Greg and I have HUGE plans for musical opportunities with the kiddos.  It's going to be absolutely great.  Man, something funny happened today regarding Sexual Harassment... if you care to know, ask!  :-)  I'm not posting it on here for ANYONE... plus, it'd just take WAY TOO LONG to type it all out!  :-\  Anyhow, me and Melissa need to leave here in a few minutes, so I shall end this post and have lotsa fun with my pal...  Auf Wiedersehen!

        *Sigh*    Man... I'm putting in the hours left and right.  Today I'll have 5.50 hours... which is more than I'll even be working when I'm at the school!  Oh well... it's all getting paid to me.  Today I have a training session about brain development from 2-5.  Oh what fun!  3 hours of BRAIN DEVELOPMENT!  But, at least Greg will be there to keep me company and make me laugh... he's funny.  I was telling him about Camp Hacknslash... he was like, "Why didn't you tell me?!  I would've gone!"  haha  Let's see... how can I describe everyone else?  Heather... she's a control freak, and she's very blunt and rude to even her friends... sorta reminds me of Jennifer... her bluntness that is.  Then there's Kristen... Kristen is very quiet and reserved to peoples' faces.  When they leave the room she vents about them... and by them I mean Heather... and by vent, I mean VENT about the blunt meanness that Heather always throws towards Kristen.  I feel sorry for Kristen, because she is sharing an apartment with Heather.  I'm sure I'll get to hear lots of stuff throughout the year from Kristen.  I don't (currently) know anyone else that's working at my site, but I'll meet them soon, hopefully.  I hope that Nick is at the session today, too... because he makes me laugh too... and with a boring topic like brain development, I'll need all the humor I can take.  Plus, I just like seeing Nick... he's cute and fun to flirt with.  Just my luck he has a girlfriend.  ; )

        New Horizons    Ya know... I'm finding that there are some guys out there that are worthy... :-)  I met a really nice guy at one of my training sessions yesterday... Ironically his name is Nick.  He's really nice, and especially cute... :-)  I'm not saying that anything in a dating relationship way will happen, because for all I know he's dating someone and just flirts alot.  However, he seems really cool, and at the very least I will have made a new work/UTSA friend.  :D  So... anyhow, training is going.  Today's sessions were extremely long... thankfully we had some group time which helped to break up the monotony of the lecturing.  Anyhow, I'm looking forward to tomorrow's sessions... because I know they'll be fun!  :-)  Okay, it's off to Jennifer's (and then Ricky's) I go... we're going to watch another Nightmare movie... gotta get them done so we'll be ready for the Freddy Vs. Jason premiere!  :-D  LATER GATOR!

        Slavework    This is the first week of my training sessions for my job with SAUM (San Antonio Urban Ministries)... and I'm in limbo about it.  I partly look forward to it, and I partly don't want to go.  Oh, well... what can ya do?  Anyhow, I'll have training sessions this week and next, and then the week of the 18th is when school starts for the kiddies... so that's when I'll be starting work.  Lucky me... I get to drive ALL THE WAY out 1604 to Bandera Rd. JUST for work for a whole week... what fun.  :-\  Oh well... at least I'm getting paid a fairly good amount of money (at least in comparison to my last childcare job).  Okay, well... off I go.  I have to go talk to Will and sign a couple papers before training today... and I need to grab some lunch as well.  Other than that... I'm still confused about lots of stuff... but, hopefully it'll pass.... I'll post something later....

        S'WONDERFUL    I had such a fun time with Trinity this week!  :-)  We watched movies, had snacks, played piano... it was a blast.  It's gotten me really pumped up to start working with SAUM in a couple weeks w/the after school program!  I love working with kids... especially kids that are fun and that are good like Trinity.  Anyhow, we had a nice week, and she told me lots of cute stories.    Next week I start the rest of my training for my job.  I'll be taking several classes on different topics related to my job... I think it'll be pretty fun.  :-)  I'm also getting excited about school starting, believe it or not.  But, then again, I always start the semester out really optimistic and happy about classes.  :-P  Well, that's all now... I'm doing laundry right now... and there's a possibility that Kim will be calling me in a few.  I shall post something later...

        WACKY WEDNESDAY!!!    1.  Who is your favorite singer/musician? Why?   Well, for rock stuff, Weezer because they're just awesome... for other listening DMB because they're very eclectic... for technical guitar stuff John Mayer... and for funny stuff either BNL or TMBG.  2.  What one singer/musician can you not stand? Why?  Christina Aguilera... she's VERY trashy... it's pretty disgusting.  3.  If your favorite singer wasn't in the music business, do you think you would still like him/her as a person?  Most likely... they're all pretty laid back and easy going... or just plain crazy and have weird, gross teeth.  4.  Have you been to any concerts? If yes, who put on the best show?  Weezer shows are always cool... DMB shows are just one big party... BNL... those guys are crazy!  The Green Day guys are fun, too... they let bunches of people come down into the pit for their set.  :-)  5.  What are your thoughts on downloading free music online vs. purchasing albums? Do you feel the RIAA is right in its pursuit to stop people from dowloading free music?   Okay, here's my take on the whole illegal downloading thing.  There's no way that it can hurt established artists, because most of them have made a lot of money as it is, and the chump change they make off of album sales... well, it doesn't hurt them.  For artists that are just trying to get their stuff out there, it helps them.  For instance, I was listening to some of John Mayer's live stuff before his album was even released to the public, and I planned on buying it after it came out (and I did).  My last little take on this is that it's not as if music downloading will take over and cause CDs to become obsolete.  Think of books and newspapers.  They have stuff online, where you can read it on the computer... and most people still prefer having a physical paper or book in their hands.  I think it's the same thing with CDs.  Because I know there are lots of things that I have on CD BECAUSE I downloaded them and found that I liked it enough to buy the CD.

        WACKY WEDNESDAY!     In honor of my brother's wedding this past weekend...   1.  White dress and tux or not?  Most definitely white dress and tux! 2.  Several attendants and ushers or only one of each?  Probably several... I have too many friends to pick just ONE... 3.  Outside or Inside Wedding?  INSIDE... I wouldn't want a wedding in the rain (like my brother's) 4.  Winter, Spring, Summer, or Fall wedding?  I'll most likely get married in the summer, but I've always liked the idea of a winter wedding... :-) 5.  Big or small wedding?  Towards the bigger end of the spectrum, but people that have big weddings would call mine smallish... 6.  Morning, afternoon, or evening wedding?  Afternoon w/ an evening reception... 7.  At the reception:  dinner or finger foods?  Dinner 8.  Hire a band or a dj?  BOTH!  I'd want a band for all the important dance stuff between groom/bride/father of the bride/mother of the groom stuff and a DJ for the other people to have a party... 9.  Flowers on corsages:  fresh or silk?  I'm going with silk, just because it's easier to keep them w/o having to dry and press them... 10.  Wedding Ceremony:  Short or long?  Short ceremony, long reception... :-)

      Sorry it took awhile to get this up today... It's been a long... BAD... day.  One which started yesterday.  I had to write up behavior documentation on one of the little guys in my group for trying to hit, yelling, and spitting at other kids... he did more (and then some) of the same today, and got written up again... :-(  It makes me sad... I don't like writing up the little ones, especially this little one, because he's so sweet normally.  But, ever since he had his eye surgery he's gradually gotten worse... and I think he has a bad day in the classroom and it carries over into ASK.  :-(  I hope things get better tomorrow... aside from that, I've been making little Halloween favors for all the kids at A.S.K. and studying for all my classes... on the upside I got A's on my last two music tests... one in theory one in dictation... I'm doing good... :-)  Anyhow... have fun with WW this week... :-)    WACKY WEDNESDAY!!!     1.   Put these movies in order of your liking from greatest to least:  -Return to OZ -SLC PUNK -Sleepaway Camp -Secretary -Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory  2.   Scooby or Scrappy Doo?   Definitely Scooby over Scrappy... cause Scrappy's annoying!  3.   Lightning Storms:  Good or bad?   GOOD!  I love to watch the lightning light up my room at night time...  4.   Jerm, John, or Owen?   John is probably my favorite, but Jerm follows at a close second.  5.   On the subject of pumpkins:  Carve those little devils or keep them around til Thanksgiving?   Well, I usually get several, carve one, and keep the others til Thanksgiving... but this year, 2 of my 3 are already spoiling... maybe I should plant them and let them take root like Ricky's onions... ; )

      She awakes...  Yes, at 6:15am on Tuesday morning... this is where I am... :-\  I had to get up extra early this morning because I usually take my shower at night.  But alas, last night I fell asleep while watching Roseanne on Nickelodeon (around 10:15pm).  I'm pretty sure my Mom came in and turned off the tv and my light, because I know that I didn't.  I was OUT, and I didn't wake up til 5:30ish this morning so that I could allow myself enough time to shower and all.  I had to make sure I would have time to dry my hair.  It's COLD outside again!  :-)  I really love winter... it's my favorite season.  Okay... so without further adieu...  Weekend Update...  I went to Austin on Friday night to go see Sinus with Ricky, Melissa, Wolf, Ruthie and her boyfriend.  I had never met Ruthie before (but had heard about her via Melissa) and I must say from the moments that I got to talk to her, I really enjoyed her personality.  The show was awesome!  The guys made fun of The Lost Boys, and man... what a show they did.  I especially enjoyed the skit in which they made fun of Cory Haim in the bathtub.  :-)  And the fact that John shamelessly made fun of the saxophone playing guy wearing purple spandex pants made me incredibly happy because I've always thought that his character was very random in that movie.  Anyhow, after Sinus we met up with Richa and one of her friends for a while.  We went to a coffee shop that was incredibly smokey... which surprised me because I thought that wasn't allowed in Austin restaurants and such anymore.  Hmmm... weird.  Anyhow, I was really tired (because I'm not used to staying up that late)... and well, when we got backt to the apt. Ricky, Wolf, and Melissa wanted to watch 24... so they went to Melissa's and watched it while I took a shower and went on to sleep.  The next day we all went to Kerbey Lane ON Kerbey Lane, and the service was surprisingly better at that establishment.  After we ate and went back to the apartment, I gathered my stuff and headed on home.  I had to tend to the animals, and they were VERY happy that I did.  :-)  The rest of Saturday was spent doing a lot of nothing.  It was a schlump day.  Sunday I looked at the ads and saw that coat I bought was on sale, so I went to Target to get a refund of the difference... then I got stuff for my costume.  :-D  All that I have to do now is sew the skirt and I'll be set for Friday night!!!   Not much else is going on.  Thankfully I don't really have any tests this week.  Just my ASL test today and a presentation on Thursday... but that's it.  Okay.... and so now I shall go... with the extra time I can get some breakfast and a cup of coffee.  :-)  I'll post something tomorrow...

      Okay, so I'm sitting at the computer kiosk in the arts building... Melissa would know where I'm referring to... we sat outside my Jazz class 2 summers ago (It's by all those chair/table things)... anyhow, I've had an interestingly easy day at classes.  Now, I'm just trying to kill some time on campus before I leave to get lunch before work.  Ya see, I always have to sit around waiting in traffic to get off campus, and so I'm avoiding that.  I'm also trying to give myself less of an opportunity to go to Target and buy something I don't even really need.  I compulsively buy things from time to time.  This is a VERY bad habit.  I used to not have this problem.  It was always one that Joe had.. not me.  Well, so I'm struggling with it now.  On another note which is related to spending money, I have bought my winter coat.  Ricky made fun of me last night because I was wearing it in the house.  But it was really cold, and I was just in the mood to wear it and break it in.  It sorta reminds me of the one that Melissa got from Burlington Coat Factory a year ago, except it's not that woolish type of fabric.  It's polyester.  Anyhow, it's really empty in here now.  Almost SCARILY empty.  I mean, I've NEVER seen it this empty in here before.  I almost have an okay feeling about if I got up and went to the restroom leaving things at the computer the way they are, and leaving my backpack over here as well.    So, what else...?  Oh!  I just saw Matt Case... he was with some girl.  Quite funny... ya know, he's in one of my classes, and he's always really nice to me.  I think it's because he doesn't want to get on my bad side.  After all, I have the dirt on him and his Kenny Baker days.  He's been dressing like a DMB fan these days.  Ya know... grungy, well-worn-in jeans... Abercrombie-ish shirt colors... flip flops, even!  Drastic change from when he was wearing FUBU and talking ebonics don't ya think???  He doesn't want me to blow his cover.  See, I have nothing to hide.  I'm pretty much the same as I was in my junior/senior years of high school... and even my goth days I am not ashamed of... and really, I don't think anyone in the arts building would care about that, because half of them are STILL in their goth phases.  :-)  Okay, I'm rambling now... but I just haven't gotten the chance to ramble on my blog in such a long time...  Maybe I should make this a MWF habit!  :-)  Anyway, I think I'm going to wrap this up and get on out of here...  It's time to go to Subway and see my friends.  :-)  Yes, that's right.  The people who work at the Subway on Bandera Rd. know me.  I walk in, their day is happier.  We joke around... this one lady (whose son works there with her) embarrasses him by telling me things from his childhood and how they never thought he'd have hair (or something) and now his hair is to his shoulders.  Funny characters they are.  Whoa... that was a very Smeagolish way for me to say that... "Come on hobbitses... follow me"  "But they stole the precious"  "No, master wouldn't steal her..." "Yes he would.. he's tricksy... he LIES..."  Anyhow.. enough of that for now... more later!  :-)

        WACKY WEDNESDAY!    Hey kids... it's a bit short this week... but here goes...  1.   Missing paper boy or crazy cat lady?   Apparently I'm a missing paper boy who is pissing off people...  2.   Cookie Monster or Elmo?   COOKIE MONSTER!  Elmo is REALLY annoying...  3.   Trains, planes, or automobiles?   Planes and automobiles... never trains... they're too slow... at least the one I went on was...  4.   Pop or Coke?   I say coke... I'm no yankee... I'm a southern texas kinda gal... :-)  5.   Hot tub of foam:  Stick your head in or take the picture?   I took the picture... and I have a 5x7 print of it!  :-D  6.   Would you drive somewhere on a whim?   Well, the only place I have driven on a whim was Canyon Lake... but Ricky and Druck drove all the way to Corpus and back one night... they wanted me to go... but I had something to do the next day... :-\  Next time I'm SO there!  Now, you may be thinking... "What's so 'wacky' about this?"  And fact is, it's totally random... Sorry for the randomness that is this week's Wacky Wednesday!  On another note, everything's good in my world... today a Shakespearean actor from England came to my communications class... he and the troupe are here to perform "Measure for Measure."  Anyhow, he was in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (a crazy movie I watched with Melissa)... and sidebar... he seemed the type that Jennifer would like to have a conversation with.  I dunno why I thought that... but I did... :-)  That's it for now... stay tuned for more updates over the weekend... :-D

        Feeling a bit down...    I don't know why... maybe the fact that 3 of my best friends are all obviously in on some joke that I'm out of (see comments link two posts below)... but I feel really down.  I know that it's in their right to have huge inside jokes without me because I don't talk to them as much as I could (or should for that matter).  But I've been so friggin' busy and have just been a huge bundle of nerves for the past week (because of stuff going on with my Grandma) that I don't really feel it's entirely my fault.  What's been going on with me?  Well, number one (first and foremost) my Grandma is much more sick than we realized, and the doctors STILL don't know what the Hell is wrong with her.  I mean, they know that she's old, and that she's having atrial fibrillation (A-fib), but it's not her heart.  Yes, you wouldn't be the only one to think that sounds really contradictory.  In addittion to all this... their previous thought that she had a minor stroke got thrown out and they said she had a minor heart attack.  However, the doctor has now said he thinks she probably suffered a minor stroke AND minor heart attack.  His remedy initially was medicine to control her A-fib.  Then the other night when I went to go visit her he came in the room while she was having some tests run, and told us something we didn't really want to hear.  He said he wants to put her on Coumadin.  This is a drug used to thin the blood.  What's the big deal?  Well, for one thing, she lives alone an hour away from any of her children.  So, if she ever falls, it literally could be life threatening because her blood would be thinned and she could bleed to death very quickly.  So, we've all been a whole jumble of nerves.  In addition to all that mess that's going on, I've been doing the whole school/work thing.  I've been doing okay in my classes and I'm doing great at work... but, I'm REALLY wearing myself thin.  I go straight from school to work (after a bite to eat, of course) and then I leave work and come home to eat, do homework, take a shower and fall into bed.  Very rarely do I have ANY extra time to just sit around... and when I do I fall asleep.  For example, last night I came home... to an empty house.  I got something to eat... I came to my room and turned on the tv with every intention of watching some tube.  However, at about 8:30, I fell asleep... and I didn't wake up again til around 12:30, at which point I mustered up enough energy to change my away message, brush my teeth, and fall back into bed.  The only upside to anything right now is that I don't have to worry about going to music lab on Fridays anymore... however, now I need to use some of that time to go to an elementary school and observe special ed kids for my exceptionalities class field experience.  ARGH!  It's never-ending this semester... and next semester is going to be even WORSE!  Mainly because I'll probably do band... although, I'm thinking of waiting until next school year altogether.  I don't know if I can do this...  and now I'm going to go look at cars (probably next weekend) so I'll have car payments to make... and I won't be able to take summer school most likely because I'll have to work and there's a good chance I can do the summer camp with A.S.K.  And it hit me last night on my drive home from work.  This is what the rest of my life is going to be like.  I'll ALWAYS be busy.  I'll never have a moment of rest... ever.  Just when I think I'll have a break, I'll remember something like, "Oh... I have to make the lesson plan about the '3' multiplication tables for Thursday," and there I'll go again.  (sigh)  And this doesn't even include the other confusions that jumble my mind every day, all day, during the week.  So... question... if we're not doing X-men for Halloween... what ARE we doing...?  Cause, I only have next weekend and the following weekend to put a costume together now.  I'm going to take a nap now, and then I'm going to do music theory homework, study for 2 music theory tests, study for an exceptionalities test, make something we need for work, do all of my sign language work, and I'll probably have a couple meals during the rest of the weekend if there's time.

        My update... finally...    Well, what a good time to update, as I'm sick as a dog.  Things have been going pretty well, aside from me getting sick, but I'll talk about that later.  Firstly, I've been doing well in all my classes... thankgoodness..!  I'm pulling A's in all my classes so far.  And, that's good because it IS the midterm right now... so, this gives a good suggestion of how the semester can turn out.  :-)  Um, there has been a bit of heartache this semester already though.  :-(  My Exceptionalities professor (Exceptionalities is about kiddos that are in special ed... except they are now referred to as 'exceptional') has had a really rough semester.  Okay, about 3 1/2 weeks ago (now) there was an elderly woman that was the victim of a hit and run accident.  She was killed.  This was my professor's grandma.  She had been giving us updates every now and then because there were a handful of us that wanted to know if they caught the creep that killed her grandma.  Anyhow... Last Friday (26 Sept) we're all sitting in class waiting for her... and we know she shows up a bit late on Fridays because of one of the field experience programs she's involved in (kids from the Reddix center come over for a "buddy program" to hang out with college kids... they find it really fun... these are high school aged exceptionals)... anyhow... about 15 minutes has lapsed, and we all start getting a bit worried, especially when those in the buddy program tell us they didn't see her.  So, we think "Well, maybe they caught that jerk..."  No... she comes by the classroom, and one of the students goes out to talk to her, especially since she was in tears out there.  Well, it turns out she had just gotten a call that morning that her grandpa (husband to the grandma) had passed away.  Needless to say, class was cancelled that day... and has been every single class meeting after that.  Anyhow, I've been praying for her and her family... that's a horrible thing to go through.  Next, there are many with questions about Greg and I.  Even I have questions about that... so don't ask anymore... when I get it all sorted out, I'll let ya know.  Right now I'm just really enjoying hanging out with someone.  I really don't click with people in a way where I could see myself being friends with them forever, and he's kinda the first person probably since Melissa that I've had that type of click with.  Anyhow, he and I are probably going to Mr. Sinus with Ricky and Melissa next Friday... :-)  Should be a great time, since I haven't been to Mr. Sinus in forever!  Okay, and now I'll let everyone in on my sick day.  Early Friday morning at about 2am, I woke up feeling really sick and spewing the contents of my stomach out a few times... I couldn't even keep water down.  I knew this was bad... and quickly decided I got it from one of the kids.  Ya see, about 3 kids in MY group alone had been gone at one point and time during the week... home sick with a stomach virus.  Okay, so, I really didn't get sleep between 2 and when I had to leave... I mustered up the strength to get to my computer and email my music prof to let him know I wouldn't be in lab that morning.  But, I still had to go on campus... because I had my communications midterm yesterday.  I think I probably got a B on it... I knew the stuff... but I was sorta out of it, and really weak.  All I wanted to do was sleep.  That is the first time in my life I had to stop about 3 times on the way from my class to the car and sit down to gather up energy to keep going.  Well, anyhow... I got home and called Greg.  He told me to stay home and to "feel better soon..."  He also told me to give Andre a call and let him know.  So I did... and I was glad I did, because I was still getting sick after that.  I was glad that I was able to doze off a few times, too.  So, anyhow, I'm finally feeling better.  I took some of that medicine that you take every 15 minutes for an hour to stop nausea and all... I guess it worked, because I feel fine now.  It's just me and Kathy at the house... my parents and brother went to the golf tourney.  They'll be home later.  If I feel well enough, maybe Kathy and I will go to a movie or something later.  We'll just see... gotta make sure I wouldn't be ralphing.    Anyhow, that's all for now... I'll try to make more of an effort to post updates in the future... My next update will most likely be next weekend... especially if Greg and I go to Austin to see Mr. Sinus with Mel and Ricky... :-)

        WACKY WEDNESDAY!     Random Thoughts...   1.   Cows:  Purple or Blue?   BLUE! 2.   Puppies:  Dead or alive?   Dead puppies... dead puppies... (damn you, Dr. Demento) 3.   Halloween:  Pumpkins or not?   Pumpkins... lots of them! 4.   Flowers:  Red, Pink, or White?   I like pink the most. 5.   Pizza toppings:  Pepperoni or Sausage?   Pepperoni... mmm... 6.   Candy:  Chocolate or something else?   Chocolate... sugar-free chocolate!  :-)

        Little Update    I had a very nice Thanksgiving.  It was great to see all my family... I especially missed my brother and sister-in-law and was glad I got to visit with them.  I was also very happy I got to see my cousins... although the youngest, Travis, wore me (and his parents) out!  He's so cute, though...  Anyhow, then Friday I spent some more time with family as my Aunt Judy and Uncle Scott came back over to just spend time with my family and Grandma.  We all had a nice dinner, and then my Mom, Kathy (sis-in-law) and I went to go pick up some things for X-mas gifts for my friends.  I needed their input and was thankful for it!  :-)  While we were doing that my aunt and uncle went to Michael's b/c my aunt was helping my uncle buy something for the youngsters...  After we all got back, we snacked on some stuff for supper while watching the A&M-UT game, and later watched  Finding Nemo .  It's an okay movie, and for some reason it was much funnier watching it with my Uncle Scott.  ;)  Those that know him understand why this is so.  :-)  After watching Finding Nemo, it was around 9pm, so my aunt and uncle each went home.    This morning my Grandma left to go back to Kerrville.  She was both happy and sad.  I was told (by her) not to talk to her about it or she'd cry... which she ended up doing as she and my aunt drove off anyway.  So, it was my family and Rob and Kathy.  We all didn't do a whole lot of stuff... just ate dinner and watched some stuff on TV... had a bit of conversation.  They showed us floorplans for possible houses they'll invest in within the year over in Houston.  I miss those two and wished they lived here in SA.  Oh well... They left around 4pm... and then after that I went over to Ricky's to spend time with the gang before everyone goes their separate ways... We won't see each other again til X-mas break... which is (thankfully) only 3 weeks away.  Anyhow, I'm very tired now and am going to sleep.  I'll post more later... :-)

        WACKY WEDNESDAY!!!    1)  DVD or VHS?   DVD all the way! 2)  Best Literary/Movie Villan:   Hmmm... the only villan that ever really freaked me out was Ursula from the Little Mermaid movie.  :-) 3)  Meat: rare or well-done?   In betweeny  ; ) 4)  To be fair-- Boxers or briefs?   I prefer a boxer guy... tighty whities have GOT to go... 5)  Beer or Liquor/Wine?   Beer or liquor...? I'm not big on wine at this point in my life.  I'm more for mixed drinks... but sometimes I enjoy a beer... 6)  Coke or Mountain Dew?   Diet Dr. Pepper 7)  Carpet or Hardwood Floors   We have laminate wood floors in the dining/living room... and I wish we had it throughout the house... 8)  American cars or foreign?   I currently own an American car, but foreign cars are pretty good, too... specifically foreign cars from Germany. 9)  Coffee: Caffeinated or Decaf?   CAFFEINATED!  What's the point, otherwise? 10)  Thought-Provoking Question of the Week: Computers: Do they make life better or worse? Why?  I can't imagine life without computers in it. They benefit more than take away from our way of life. Think about all the knowledge that is shared and distributed now. Sure there are negatives about technology, but in this case, I think benefits definitely out-weigh the negatives.  Plus, think of where computer technology is headed...

        MY NEW CAR!!!    Well, I got my new car!  I got a Saturn ION, and I LOVE it!  It's silver, and it's wonderful... and so was my experience buying the car!!!  We went on Wednesday night and closed the deal.  By we, I mean my Dad and I.  We signed off on all the papers, and then I went to pick it up the next day.  So, Thursday night my Dad and I went to pick up the car and let them have my old one (because I traded it).  The Saturn people gave me a rose (pale pink, my favorite... I don't know HOW they knew that) and I got a tour of the building.  Whenever I take my car for anything, I can go to their workroom (if I have homework or something I need to work on) or I can watch TV (they have cable).  It was neat in a hoaky way.  Then the guy called over all the other Saturn employees to send me off.  They chanted this thing to me, and then I got to get in the car and take off!  It was a wonderful experience!  In about a week my plates should come in, and they're going to put them on for me.  They're also going to wash my car for me as well!  :-)  I'm just happy in general about my car and how everything turned out with it!      MADRIGAL DINNER    Saturday I drove to Austin because it was Melissa's last night in the Madrigal Dinner and I was going to attend.  She did an absolutely beautiful job in it, and I really enjoyed her singing to us at the table.  Everytime the wenches and all would go up to the stage to sing stuff, I could hear her beautiful voice ringing out.  :-)  I'm so very proud of her for trying out and doing all the Madrigal Dinner stuff, and I was very happy to hear she plans on doing it again next year!  :-)  WAY TO GO, MELISSA!    THANKSGIVING    Thanksgiving is this week... which means my dead days are already next Thurs/Fri!  OMG... this semester has FLOWN by!  Anyhow, I'm so glad it's the week of Thanksgiving... I only have my classes tomorrow, and then I'm done with classes for this week!!!  Tomorrow night Melissa is coming to town, and so is Jennifer.  Wednesday the three of us are going out to eat lunch.  I can't wait to spend time with the group again... I've missed it!  Although, I've been lucky enough to hang out with Melissa and the Austin people this semester... and this past weekend especially, I had a great time with Melissa!  I miss Jennifer, too, though.  I wish she had chosen to go to school here in TX.  Oh, well... she'll be done after this semester and will hopefully choose to move back to TX.  :-)  Okay, I'm done with this post... hope you enjoyed...!!!  :-D

All the peeps in Austin will see it this weekend when I go to Madrigal Dinner... :-)  Anywho... I'll think about putting up a wacky wednesday later, but I just don't know if I'll be home long enough to do it... I may decide to drive to Mexico in my new car... :-)

        My car...    I didn't get my car yesterday... :-\  Well, I couldn't because the salesman I wanted to make the sale was off yesterday, AND my Dad had to go to the church and finish some maintenance work, so we ran out of time.  So, what's the plan now?  I will be going in this week and getting all the stuff ready.  There was some stuff I wanted added, so I'll have to pick up my car the next day.  I think we'll probably go tomorrow night after I get off work, and then I can pick up my car on Tuesday...!!!  I'm so excited!  I'm getting the Saturn  urlLink ION 2 .  It's a very cute car, and the inside is really really cool!  Once you open the link, just click on exterior if you want to see more pictures.  The trunk in this car is HUGE, too.  AND the coolest feature is that the doors of the car will not dent!  :-)  The guy showed me and my Dad.  He punched it, he kicked it... it doesn't dent.  It pops right back!    Okay, in addition to that, I went to 'O Say Can You... Swing Some More!' last night with my family.  Last year we went and saw 'O Say Can You Swing!' and it was awesome, it swept the Globe awards for last year's musicals.  Anyhow, the people in it are extremely talented, AND it's San Antonio's best kept secret.  I want to go again!  And there's this absolutely GORGEOUS guy in the show and he sings so beautifully!  I'd marry him on a whim!  hehe  Anyhow, that's all for now... I'll post more later...!

      Sorry about the lack of Wacky Wednesday... if you saw my away messages tonight, you understand why there is no Wacky Wednesday up... I had about 4 hours of stuff to do, and I had the energy to do about 1-1/2 hours of stuff.  :-(  So... I'm finally done... Thank GOODNESS...!  But I'm incredibly nervous about my ASL presentation tomorrow.  I dunno why... but I am... I'm just always afraid that I'm going to totally botch stuff...  Okay, back on topic now... I'll attempt getting a Wacky Wednesday up tomorrow... but I make no guarantees... I also make none about next week... but I think I'll be able to get one up then... if not, there will be one the following Weds for SURE... Oh, and I think I'm getting my new car this weekend... which means... there is DEFINITELY going to be a post over the weekend... and you folks in Austin will get the chance to see it when I come for Madrigal dinner... :-)  YAY!

        WACKY WEDNESDAY (a day late)!!!    1.   Sleep 6-9 hours or take a cat/power nap?   I prefer a LONG sleep... I dunno why.  BUT, I do cat nap from time to time.  2.   TV:  Channel surf, or always know what you're gonna watch?   I do my fair share of channel surfing.  3.   Jazz:  Big band or Davis/Monk era jazz?   I prefer big band, but I like it all!  :-D  4.   Text books:  Sell them back or keep them so you have an interesting 'library' someday?   I plan on keeping them... mostly (for me) because I may need reference to them as a teacher.  5.   Wacky Wednesday:  make suggestions for topics or just partake in the half-assed work of *moi*?   I'd love for people to make suggestions from time to time... sometimes I just get stumped for topics.  Especially recently with all my crazy school-work-sleep schedule.

      I had a wonderful Christmas and I hope everyone else did as well... I got to spend a lot of time with my Dad's side of the family, and I'm looking forward to my brother and sister-in-law coming to town next weekend. :-)  I just got home from Ricky's where I had a very fun time tonight.  Along with his family and Jennifer and Melissa... I played an interesting game of Pop Culture Trivial Pursuit (the one with the DVD) and it was very fun.  Then we watched The Hulk... and then I came home.  :-)  Anyhow, I'll post more details of things from my family time (Christmas Day) later.  For now, I shall retire to my bed where I may dream sweet dreams of the person I shall end up with.  :-)

      So... okay... Going to Austin today and won't be back til tomorrow...  Everything is going pretty well... yesterday was my last day of work til about 6 January... and we had a small number of kids (as we imagined it would turn out).  It was sorta sad to me... I've gotten so used to being around these kids day in and day out... and I really did think that I would be SO HAPPY to have a break... but it turns out, I'm really going to miss not seeing them for a few weeks.  And yesterday we had so few kids, that Greg said he was going to send a couple of us home early.  So, I decided since I got an hour of pay for the Christmas party we had I would volunteer to leave early.  So, I left at 4:45, and the point where I realized I would miss the kids was when about 20 kids ran over begging me not to leave early.  "Please, Miss Kelsie, stay even though you don't have to."  It's difficult to explain to a group of 6 and 7 year olds the rules we have about not being able to stick around when we're off the clock.  I had the same group of kids for the past 3 weeks (because none of us wanted to bother making up new chores and rotation schedules after Thanksgiving break to now)... so, we got REALLY attatched... and I had 3 girls from my group hugging me so tightly...  I really felt appreciated the past week as I got several gifts from kids and their parents for the semester.  We got several "to the staff" gifts, and there were about 5 parents/kids that fixed up individual gifts for us.  You really feel rewarded by all of this...  Anyhow, I need to stop typing now because I have to finish cleaning up and packing and all to go to Austin today... I'll post more after I return...

      I'm about to go off into the wonderful world of Christmas shopping this morning... then I gotta get home to get ready for work, and then tonight I'm running off to Austin.  Druck's riding with me.  We're going to see the midnight showing of LoTR:  Return of the King tonight with Melissa, Ricky, and whomever else comes along.  It's going to be great!  I've been waiting for the last one since Two Towers came out on DVD!!!  We're coming back tomorrow morning... then I get to go to work... :-\  BLAH!  This is my last week of work til January 6th... I love that!  I'm ready for the weekend, too!  We're going to Mr. Sinus on Saturday and then we're all getting together to hang out.  I think that we're going to attempt making a gingerbread house out of gingerbread this year... I  think .  We'll see what happens... All we have to do is buy a bunch of that ready made gingerbread from HEB... but, if we're going to make houses we really need to use some royal icing this year instead of the stuff you buy in the store... or we're going to have the same problems we had last year with it falling in on itself and stuff.  I'll have to check into this stuff before Saturday... :-)  Anyhow, it's off I go... I'm gonna hop in the shower and then off I go in search of Christmas presents for loved ones and friends... :-D

        Poke a fork in me...    I'M DONE!  I've finished finals for this semester, and I'm SO GLAD that I have!!!  Now all I have to worry about is getting through one more week of work, and then I'm free for about 2-1/2 weeks!  YAY!  Our final grades aren't posted yet, but I already know that I got an A in my communications class... and quite honestly, I was sad to leave that one.  I really enjoyed that class, and I made several friends in there... of which I will probably only see a few from time to time.  Oh well... so goes life.  I wasn't very sad to walk away from ASL (Sign Language) though... it was just so much work and so very time consuming... I was sad to walk from my music classes... especially Dr. Bruenger's Music in Contemporary Life class.  Dr. Bruenger is just awesome.  I mean, how many professors would suggest figuring out thematic music for each individual in the class as if we were part of a sitcom?  Plus, there were really fun people in that class... like Zac and Jered.  I'll miss Aural Skills... even though we had to sight sing minor keys with the evil fi-si's... but I'll get round two of aural and music theory classes next semester with Dr. Balentine.  However, through all of this, I'm looking forward to the classes I have next semester.  I'm not taking any classes directly associated with teaching, though.  I mean, classes I NEED for my certification, but they have nothing to do with teaching methods and such.  I'm taking a math class and a science class/lab.  WEIRD!  Haven't taken those since my first two semesters of college!!!  Hmmm.... well, I must jet now... I'm off to take care of Christmas-related things... I shall post more later!  :-)  GOOD LUCK WITH FINALS to everyone else...!!!

I'm letting all know in advance, that there will not be a Wacky Wednesday next week, either... so, look for it the following Wednesday... Sorry, I can't make promises because of finals... however, I may surprise everyone and actually get one posted... :-)  We'll see... In the meantime, I'll probably make an update post the next 2 weekends... :-)  later

      Not much going on... just school and work... however, I got some good news yesterday...!  Druck was cast in Sweet Charity!!!  WOOHOO!  I don't know if what I did with him Saturday (in preparation) was really of any help... but, he thanked me anyhow, and that's more than enough payment...!  :-)  CONGRATS, DRUCK!!!  Anyhow... that's all for now...  Oh, and I've had some BNL lyrics stuck in my head...    Upside Down  ...I'm not surprised it's come to this Sooner or later there must be another's kiss Behind that kiss a promise of a life of bliss Yeah, great I won't be takin' the bait I'd rather drown And I will not turn my whole life upside down  Imagine everything you've done Under a microscope on view for everyone And if the King of Circumspection's here He's come in vain I won't be sharing the blame I wear the crown And I will not turn my whole life upside down...  It's a good cd... I wish it were a BIT more silly like the other cds... but I like the serious BNL side as well...

      I'm feeling very giddy lately... :-)  This week of classes went by extremely quickly... and very well.  I've been having a great time catching up with people in the music dept. and just sitting around laughing.  It reminds me very much of HS band, actually... except it's not quite as clique-ish.  Plus, I think that Sally is over the whole "Jered and me talking" thing... She sat next to me in microcomputer class... and we helped each other out.  Jered looks so different!!!  He cut off his moustache and goatee!!!  He looks a lot younger without all the facial hair... Anyhow, he accidentally walked into my music theory class... as he was making his rather humourous exit, he waved hi to me, said "see ya later Kelsie" and gave me a wink.  He's such a flirt!  Of course everyone then turned to me and asked if something was brewing there.  Then I had to explain to about 15 people that he and I had a class last semester and became friends.  Ugh... Now, in addition to Mattie always trailing me, I have Brent trailing me now too.  Freshmen... Brent is much less direct about it, though.  He's a very subtle admirer... which I appreciate, because I can still be friends with him.  It's more difficult to be nice around Mattie, because I'm always afraid he's going to ask me out or try to put his arms all around me and stuff.  Anyhow... it was so funny yesterday, because me, Naomi, Sandy and Bridget went to the JPL building for some breakfast before our science class... and Brent came in... he came right over to the table (it was just me and Naomi there) and he gave me this big hug.  He was meeting some others from the music dept. for some breakfast and all.  Anyhow... after he left, Naomi was like, "Ooooh... Kelsie.  Who was that... he was ALL about giving you the big hug!"  Hahaha  She's so funny!  I explained to her that I knew him from music stuff... he's a freshman... and that he apparently developed some little thing for me over the break.  I'd never date him.  Superficial as it may seem, I like guys who are taller than me... and Brent is like, 5' 5".  He's really sweet, though... and he's a GREAT guitar player.  So, yeah... onto work stuff....  Work has been pretty great this week, too.  We had some interesting stuff go on this week... one thing is apparently Mary (another Child Care Specialist) told some of the boys in the 4th/5th grade group she'd take them to a movie this weekend.  Now, I don't know if I'm the only one... but that just seems WRONG.  I don't think that we should have outside contact with these kids.  Now, I know I'm hypocritical for saying this... given the Joe stuff from HS... but, it's just different for elementary school kids... plus, there has to be authority in our situation.  Joe had no authority with us at all... he was too casual from the get-go for that.  But anyway, she's going to not have as much of an authority standpoint with these guys... not to mention, if the other kids found out, they won't understand why THOSE boys get to go to a movie with her and not them.  At any rate, I don't think that Greg knows about it... and I now have to decide if I should say anything or not.  As it is, it was harder for ME to control that group this week, because they were always wandering off in the cafeteria (during roll) to go and talk to Mary about going to the movie this weekend.  Then yesterday I saw her talking to one of the boys' parents about it, and the Mom got pretty upset about her wanting to take her son to a movie.  She was saying to the boy, "We don't KNOW her... you can't just go out with a STRANGER to a movie... I've never even TALKED to her before...!!!"  Why is this...?  Because Mary doesn't talk to parents... EVER.  And that's one of the things she's supposed to do.  Greg has gotten really pissed at her lately because she's not doing her job very well.  She doesn't really care about what she's supposed to do.  She just tries to win the affections of the guys in the oldest group.  That's why he put me in charge of it the past two weeks.  That and he wanted to be paired up with me (since Greg W quit and Greg's had to be in ratio).  Oy... also, yesterday Steve (or Scuba Steve as we call him) came to substitute (he's an A.S.K. sub)... and he's come several times before to sub at our site... he's really cool.  He's usually pretty quiet... he really only talks to Greg and me.  And... okay... so, yesterday he was acting different around me.  Like, he walked me to my car when I left... he's never done that... and his truck wasn't THAT far from mine... I dunno what's going on there...  Anyhow... that's all for now...

      Ack!  I have a lab today... :-\  Hmmm... let's see... this week has gone by quickly... and it was pretty good.  Minus the fact that I have TONS of homework this weekend, I'm ready to relax on Sunday and Monday!  :-)  I think I'm gonna get the rest of my evil homework out of the way in snippets.  I have like, 5 pages of Music Theory homework... BLAH!  Then I have a bunch of math homework.  I also need to go out and buy some Zip disks for my music tech. class.  I have to study for my quiz in that class, too.  Anyhow, I'm gonna go back and lay in bed for a bit more til I have to jump in the shower and eat some lunch before going to campus for lab.  BLAH!  :-)

      Hiya there!  Well, I've had a very good first two days of classes... :-)  I've seen lots of people from last semester that I missed over the break a bit more than I thought.  Brent and Frank and I were hanging out in the foyer of the music building today before we went into Dr. Balentine's music theory class... what fun we had!  Then Brent and I went upstairs to find out where they moved the computer lab because I was going to have my microcomputer applications in music class there.  We found it w/o much trouble and then goofed off for about 10 minutes making our way back downstairs.  Then Brent wanted to talk to Sally, and so I shoved off because Sally isn't too fond of me b/c Jered (her recent ex) and I became friends last semester... and she doesn't like that at all.  So, good news about classes... I have several people from my Sign Language class in two of my classes on MWF... :-D  I was happy to see them... they're so much fun, even though they're much older than me.  One (Sandy) has a son who's married and also has a granddaughter... the other (Bridget) has 2 children in middle school and one is about to go to Roosevelt next year!  He's the one I gave a bit of a lesson to to prepare him for district band tryouts last October.  He made 2nd chair... I must've given him some good pointers, and she is forever grateful for my help.  :-)  Then there's Naomi, who is 20 and engaged... she's so nice and I'm glad that I made friends with her because she's so very nice.  Okay, other good news... my microcomputer appl. in music class that I went to for the first time today had a bit of a problem.  You see, over the break, they were supposed to be getting all new computers for our music computer lab... and we were going to have 30 computers... this is why the lab location moved.  Alrighty, so, they didn't get the new computers, and we still have the old ones, and there are only 15.  So, bumping the cap for the class up to 30 wasn't such a good idea, because now we have 29 people in a class where there are only 15 computers.  *sigh*  So, the conclusion that Dr. Sebald came to was to give us one lab day a week.  Half of us will attend class on Tuesday, and the other half on Thursday.  I picked Tuesday, because I like to get stuff out of the way at the begining of the week.  :-)  And also because, now I only have one class this Thursday and it gives me time to run my car over to Saturn to be serviced.  ; )  Well, that's about it for my update thus far... oh... well, Greg Wright had to quit A.S.K.  :-(  He had a school schedule conflict.  A class he was going to take in the morning ended up only getting 4 people in it... so they cancelled it and told them they need to take the afternoon class... which runs from 2-3:15... which really keeps him from making it to work.  Good news for him is that he's probably going to be able to get a subbing position for Tues/Thur/Fri with A.S.K.  Our sites are always in need of extra people to sub.  Especially ours right now... which is why Scuba Steve has been at our site.  He's good people!  :-)  He's very funny, and I'm really glad that he and I have the oldest kids together this week.  Although, yesterday it was me and Greg Padilla... and that was lotsa fun, too... we like to joke with the kids a lot...  Okay... that's all for now... Enjoy!

      So guess what tomorrow is?  Yep, that's right... it's my first day of classes... :-\  It's gonna suck... It's gonna suck to go from school to work again... especially considering I probably won't be able to fall asleep at a decent hour tonight.  I think I'm gonna have to pop a couple sleeping pills to make sure that I can get enough of it before my long day tomorrow.  I'm also going to have to deal with the book situation again starting tomorrow.  I'm not looking forward to that at all.  Oh well.  Can't avoid it... and the only way I would've been able would been to have gone to campus last week and buy books ahead of time.  But then I'd have to deal with the horrid situation that is returning books.  There's just no winning.  I'm hoping that we don't have to shell out $650 for books again this semester.  That was just horrible last semester.  I mean, they've already hit my parents with a 1.8233% rate charge on the credit card payment for tuition... which was higher than usual already because of tuition deregulation.  My Mom wasn't pleased at all that she had to fork over an extra $45 because she paid with a credit card.  And that happened because they no longer mail bills.  You pay them at Fiscal Services (and wait in a long line) or pay them with a credit card via our online service.  Grrreat!    Anyhow... I'm a bit excited to see people from last semester's music classes!!!  :-D  I've missed all but one a lot more than I thought I would.  They're just so much fun...!!!  Especially Allyssa... she's a funny one, she is!  Anyhow, that's all for now... I'll post more later in the week to update on how everything's going.  :-P   SIGN MY GUESTMAP, PLEASE .... :-D

      I'm climbing on up in this little international internet world!  I've had another visitor from Germany (My second in like, 3 days) and Yesterday I had a visitor from Denmark!  WOOHOO!!!  Good golly Miss Molly!  My proudest moment was when Melissa said, " I  haven't even had someone from Germany visit  my  blog!"  :-)  I felt so accomplished... and I haven't even done anything...

      I'm feeling much better now... which is good.  The week at work went by really fast... but of course now that only means that classes start Monday.  :-\  I'm really not feeling like going back to classes so soon!  On the upside, Melissa and Amy both let me know that Barenaked Ladies are going to be in Austin March 10.  This is awesome!  I haven't seen them in like, 4 years... and I'm PSYCHED!  Call it a guilty pleasure, but the music is awesome, and they are awesome live!  :-D  So, I have that to look forward to.    This is all I really feel like posting right now... but please take note of the map thing I have... The frog that's doing excersises (On the  LEFT side column ) has several things above him.   The second linking box above him is where you can place a pin on a map to tell me where you are... and I'd love it SO MUCH if you would place a pin on there letting me know where you're from...!  :-D

      First of all... I'm sick.  Great!  :-\  Stupid allergies...  Second of all, I'm back to the working wheel.  Tuesday was the first day back since the break, and it was nice to see all the kids.  I must've gotten about 50+ hugs that first day because they were all so glad to see us again.  I heard all about Christmas and the presents they received.  The only bad part about the first day was that the kids were stir-crazy because they didn't have recess during school OR at A.S.K. (it was too cold).  Yesterday was even better... we got to take the kids out for about 20 minutes... only bad part about yesterday was that since it's the new year, Chess Club started up again... which means that we get stuck in the gym for the first hour of A.S.K.  BLAH!  That sucks!  I hate having the kids in there because they have the room to run around... and then they do... and then they get in trouble.  In addition to that, they get really loud... and as we all know from our elementary school days... when it gets loud in a gym, the only thing you can hear is a whistle... and we can't use whistles.  So, we have to yell extra loud so they can hear us.    This is just part of it, though.  It may sound like I hate my job, but I actually love it.  This is the first time I've been "sick" at work... and THAT'S why I sound extra peeved about stuff... I have less patience when I'm feeling like my head is going to implode... and I can't reach it to detonate the bomb because it feels like it's floating way above my body.  Doesn't it sound like fun?  Well, I must jet now... I have to finish getting ready for work.  I just felt like updating... especially after seeing someone from Germany visited my blog!  :-)  WOOHOO!

      Yesterday was interesting.  I went to lab, and then called Ricky when I was done.  Then he called me back and wanted to know if I wanted to see The Passion of Christ with him and his scissor happy chick as well as Druck.  I said "SURE!" and then about 20 minutes later Ricky was at my house so that we could go get tickets at the Quarry.  They were sold out for the showing we wanted, so his gal pal with the scissors said she couldn't go.  So we decided to go check at Live Oak for tickets.  Well, it was sold out there as well.  So then we decided to grab something to eat and go back to his place.  We ended up staying around there, visiting with his family (his parents, Mike, Courtney, Uncle John, Kim, and Trinity) and eating dinner for his Uncle John's birthday.  We had a good dinner, and some wonderful cake which Trinity made.  ;)  Then, his uncle, Kim, and Trinity left.  We were just sitting around trying to think of something to do... and his Mom asked us to run over to Kim's to get Cream of Tartar for a cheesecake she was making.  So, we did, and we also stopped by my house to get T3:Terminator 3 so his parents could watch it, and so I could get my car.  During all of this, we decided to go see Lia, because we hadn't seen her in awhile and we wanted to meet her new boyfriend.  So, that is exactly what we did.  They were having a party because Lia had just finished her 100th  Trinitonian .  So, we got there around 11ish, and stayed til about 12:30.  Then we stopped by Krispy Kreme on Austin Hwy, and Druck ended up getting his coffee there (he needed coffee to sober up after having a few drinks at Lia's) and we all got a doughnut.  Then we went back to Ricky's for a couple minutes, and then I went home.  I fell asleep soon after, because I was tired.  :-)  It was an adventure... and I was really glad to see Ricky.  We also talked about seeing Mr. Sinus this weekend.  So, I said that'd probably work out great, and that I'd call Scuba Steve and invite him.  I dunno if he'll come, but at least I'll be inviting him to do something with me, right?  (No more cat in the mouth of a certain Austonian chick!)    What am I currently doing?  Well, I just got up from dozing off... so I have yet to start my Genetic Disorder paper, and I still have like, 2-3 loads of laundry to get done!!!  OY!  So, off I jet now!!!

      Stay or leave  I want you not to go  But you should  It was good as good goes  Stay or leave  I want you not to go  But you did  I'm going to miss seeing Steve everyday... So, I think I've decided to just get his number from Greg and give him a call and see if he wants to go hang out.  He sorta asked me to go see Passion with him tonight, but it was very open-ended and he never closed the deal, so I just let it go. I fully intended to ask him in person today, but Chris was hanging around, and I didn't want to say anything to him with Chris around.  *sigh*  Okay... that's all for now...

      Well, I had an AWESOME weekend with Rob, Kathy, Dave, Jana, and my parents.  It was so much fun to hang out with Dave and Jana again!  We all played LoTR Trivial Pursuit on Saturday night.  The game started at 8pm... and didn't end til a bit after 1am!  It was fun, though... Jana and I both got consumed by the Ring Wraith... so we just sat and watched after that... it was very fun to watch!  You wouldn't think it would be, but it was... then Jana finally went on to bed, and I stayed on because the end of the game was nearing... and I wanted to see someone win.  Dave finally won... he had been winning and trying to finish up the game for about an hour.  Okay, so then Sunday my parents, Uncle Scott, and I went to the Rodeo.  It was pretty good.  It was more eventful than normal because it was the finals.  So, we got to see the best of the best, which was fun.  However, there were some bad moments.  Like the cowboy that got his hand stuck in the strap and was dragged around for about a minute... and you could see him struggling, trying to free himself... finally one of the helpers caught up to the horse and slowed it down so he could free himself.  He didn't have any broken bones, he was just bruised up a bit.  Then during the calf roping (where there's a single rider that ropes the calf's neck and then ties 3 legs together) one of the calves was injured... pretty bad.  When I say pretty bad... I mean... we all pretty much concluded that its neck was broken.  At first we thought it was one of it's legs... but considering the calf roping was the 3rd event out of about 9... and we never heard anything about the injured calf... it's safe to assume that the neck was broken.  Oy... it was depressing.  Anyhow...on a happier note... I got an A on my midi project.  We presented them in class today... and then everyone clapped afterwards (Dr. Sebald had a clap-o-meter to measure the amount of clapping)... and with the claps after mine, I got an A.  Everyone did... :-)  Anyhow... Okay, that's enough for now... more later... :-)

      Scuba Steve is sick.  :-(  He should be back on Monday, though.  I hope he feels better soon!  Okay... so, I need to ask him if he plans on going to DMB in August... and possibly offer going together... and other people should go to... like a certain Melissa Louise Morris... because I think she'd really enjoy it a lot!  :-)  I had a pretty good week at work and at school.  Minus the fact that I thought I had a test in math today... but didn't.  I got all mixed up... it's Monday.  So, yay... I get more study time.  I have a midi project due on Tuesday... which will be presented to the class.  I'm going to work on it Monday and wrap it up on Tuesday morning (early) because I have no class in theory... I have a fairly large music theory project due next Thursday, though... that was assigned due to Dr. Balentine's future absence on Tuesday.  I also should probably get my stuff done for lab tomorrow... I haven't written it out yet.  And I have 2 graphs to do.  BLAH!  So, I'm really looking forward to Spring Break.  I just want to be able to totally veg-out and not have to worry about school or work.  I need to talk to Steve next week and see if he wants to go out.  Ya know, Greg offered to give me his number... but my response to Greg was, "it would REALLY freak me out if someone who I knew didn't have my number called me and asked me out... even if I knew them... I would rather them ask me for it themself first..."  He quickly agreed and said he hadn't thought of it that way.  So, we'll see... I'm wondering if he's going to turn me down... I was thinking of asking him if he'd like to go get some dinner after work next week, or go out and do something next weekend to get to know each other better.  That seems innocent enough, and it's very truthful... because we DON'T know each other that well.  I dunno... we'll just see what happens and go from there.  :-D

      Steve didn't show up to work today... We don't know what happened... but Greg and I know he wouldn't NOT show up...  We figure that he either A) got in an accident... or B) was told by Henry to go to a different site, and Henry failed to inform us.  I hope he's there tomorrow... I have something to ask him...!  ;)

      Okay... so I've been asked numerous times why I'm so smiley lately.  And the reason is this:  Remember how I said I was probably going to end up with a crush on Steve...?  Yeah... it happened.  That's reason numero uno.  The next (and most recent) reason is this:  I found out that Steve is single and looking... specifically for a very musical girl.  That I am... this pleases me greatly!  Could there be a possibility here?  I dunno... I'm going to give it a shot and see if he wants to go out sometime... if he says no, that's okay too... I'm still just in crush mode... so it won't hurt that badly... but I should probably do so soon before I start feeling more... I wouldn't wanna get shot down then.  That'd suck!

      Yeah... so I dyed my hair back to the plain 'ol brown...  It's pretty though... I may get highlights again sometime... but not anytime soon.  I mean, I'm probably gonna chop off my hair some come summertime anyway...  Texas summers are too hot to have long hair.  But, I dunno... we'll see.  I may decide to keep the length.  ;)  Anyhow, I'm going to work on my music compostion some more now after I finish up my laundry.  OH!  I think I get to see Steve tomorrow... :-D  I dunno... depends on whether or not he's needed at another site and if we get the new gal.  Bye bye for now.

      Yesterday turned out to be a better day than I thought it'd be...  On a sad note, I never got together with Justin and Amanda... something came up with the family or something and so we had to postpone it.  It's okay, I'll see them soon enough.  I got some mystery call on my cell phone... still have to figure out who that is/was.  And I emailed Greg about Scuba Steve to get some advice on that situation.  I've come to realize that I will probably have to bring it up and say something to Scuba Steve, because I don't think he's forward enough to ask me out.  But we'll see... he may surprise me.  ;)  I'm excited, though... because my brother and Kathy are coming to town next weekend and Dave and Jana are coming too!  My Dad's stock broker gets him tickets to the Rodeo every year.  This year my Dad got tickets for 2 shows... On Saturday, Rob, Kathy, Dave and Jana are all going to see Robert Earl Keene.  They're going Saturday because my Dad had invited them... and forgot that I can't go on Saturday because I have lab....  So, Sunday afternoon (2nd show my Dad ended up getting tickets for) my Dad, Mom, Uncle Scott and I are going to see Neal McCoy.  It should be fun.  I'm excited to get to spend some time with my brother and all and to see Dave and Jana again.  Maybe we'll all go out on Friday night, depending on when they get in town and how tired they are.  I mean, Dave and Jana are parents of 3, ya know?  A boy and 2 little twins.  And they're only a year apart.  So I'm sure they're always tired.  It'll be nice to catch up with all of them... and I've really missed my brother and Kathy.    Okay, on another note...  I really should re-highlight my hair.... my hair has grown out about an inch... and it bothers me.  Maybe I'll do that tomorrow, since I don't have work.  Okay... I've typed enough and I think I'll stop rambling now... Off to daydream about a very wonderful and cute guy... :-D  Leave me messages and stuff... I'll get back to ya...

      Yeah... so... Sorry about the lack of posting in recent days.  I've been bogged down with various things...  Okay... so.  Yesterday I was REALLY sick with a migraine.  I swear... I came home from work REALLY sick... I just crawled into bed... totally skipped out on dinner... because I felt like I was going to ralph anyway... and I fell asleep at 7pm... I didn't wake up til 6ish this morning to get ready to go to class.  Upside to all this...?  I only had one class to worry about today... AND I got wonderful compliments from two of the guys in the music dept. on looking "hot."  That was great.  Those comments are few and far between.  Anyway, we jammed out on the piano, guitar, and me singing for about 30 minutes before our music theory test.  That was such fun! (and also very cliche of music people... :-\  Oh well)  So... we (and by we I mean Frank and I) came out of our theory test hoping to see some tacos (the music sorority sells them every Tuesday... hence the adopted name of Taco Tuesday!)....There were NO TACOS... and it was a TACO TUESDAY!!!  What in the name of sweet Jesus were those crazy sorority chicks thinking not having tacos for us?!?!  :-\  Oh well... on that note, I shall close... oh yeah, we had site evaluation today at work... it sucked balls...!  But on the good side, I got lots of flirt time in with Steve... hehe  Goodness...which apparently some of the kiddies picked up on... being that they told Steve he should make me a Valentine's Day card... it was cute, though!  hehe  I dunno... I probably flirt with him too much... and if I keep it up I'll end up with a crush on him... :-P  Okay... that's enough... more later.

      I've just been around, I guess... I've been really sleepy... I don't know why... I think it's the weather, though.  Anyhow... I have my science lab today, and then I'll be in the music lab finishing up my midi project, because it's due on Monday... I just want to get it done and out of the way... and I want to get it done today, because I don't want to be in the music lab tomorrow... cause that'd suck.  Anyway, so... Steve may be coming over to our site permanently.  Yesterday was Mary's last day, and we're getting someone else on Monday to replace Greg W. (the one who left the begining of last month because of a school conflict)... anyhow... Steve may end up at our site permanently... and he's been rather giddy at the concept of that.  He was at our site on Wednesday... and he said to me, "It'd just be so cool if I came here permanently... then I could hang out with you ALL the time...!"  Hmmmm... don't know what to think of that... but if he'll be doing my closing duties (like he did on Wednesday) for me ALL the time if he comes to our site... then BRING HIM ON THE TEAM AT STEUBING!  :-)  Okay... nothing else now... but maybe later after I return from the evil UTSA 1604 campus.... ;-)

      So... not much going on.  I think I'm sick again : (  I woke up in the middle of the night Friday night and my throat hurt SO BAD... so, yesterday after I got home from lab (when it wasn't any better) I said something to my Mom.  She told me to try some Zicam spray.  It tastes like booty, but I already feel like it's helping.  It's that medicine that's supposed to shorten the length of the 'common cold.'  Hopefully it works... because I'm tired of being sick!    I have a fair amount of math homework to do today... I don't feel like doing it b/c it's Superbowl Sunday!  I'm not even rooting for a team, but I like football... so I wanna watch it... plus, I like the commercials and halftime entertainment... ;)  I watched  urlLink Center Stage  again last night...  I love that movie.  It takes me back to my dancing days... I miss dancing.  Maybe I'll throw some into my working out routine.  It's good aerobic work and I enjoy it so it won't really seem like I'm working out.  Well, I'm going to go... it's almost time for Sunday Dinner.  We always eat early on Sundays...

      Well, yesterday and today were quite pleasant!  Yesterday I went to my lab as per usual... and I was going to go to Austin that afternoon so that I could attend Mr. Sinus Pretty in Pink last night with Ricky, Wolf, and Melissa.  So, Ricky called when I was at home, and said they were going to go to the store to get pink hairspray... so I asked him to just wait til I got there because it was only going to take me an hour to drive up.  So, once I got there, we changed (well, Ricky and I did) and then Ricky called Melissa and told her to come over so that we could go on.  So, we stopped and got some pink hairspray, and then went over to Jeff and Marta's house in Round Rock (North of Austin).  Their house is so wonderful!  I imagine that is how my brother and sis-in-law's place will look once it's all done.  After we visited for awhile, we went back to the apartment... Ricky, Wolf, and I grabbed some food from TC's to eat before we left to go to the Drafthouse.  So, after about 25 minutes or so, and a can of pink hairspray later, we were ready to leave.  The show was pretty good.  I think that I enjoyed as much as I did because Owen wasn't there.  He's my least favorite... and anyhow, the jokes were pretty funny.  They made a LOT of sex jokes that cracked me up.  Then during the "Stop the Movie!" part, Jerm, who was dressed as Duckie serenaded Melissa and I to Otis Redding's Try a Little Tenderness (as Duckie does to Andie in the movie).  He decided to step onto our little table thing... and well.... It would've worked out much better had he not slipped on the menu that was laying on the table top, and in the process of which falling (mostly on Melissa) Melissa and I and knocking over my cup of water, which spilled all over....!  hehehe  It was SO FUNNY!  Anyway, so, then we went back to the apartment after chatting with Alexis and her two friends for awhile and got things together to drive to San Antonio.  Then today we all went to Druck's musical, Sweet Charity, at St. Phillip's.  They did an okay job.  I mean, you honestly shouldn't expect it to be like a professional production... but they faired well considering the limited number of crew people they had.  A lot of the cast had to double as cast AND crew members.  Plus, in the first act the fire alarm went off and we all had to evacuate the auditorium.  And then it went off again... but we didn't have to evacuate that time.  I may decide to go back next weekend... but I probably won't have time.  We have that option to make up for the disturbance of the fire alarm going off in the beginning of the first act.  :-)  However, I will most likely be attending a party next weekend... and then Saturday is the drumline state championships.... and then Sunday... is something.  I don't know what, but something.  Probably mostly getting some studying in.  Anyhow... this week should be very nice!  :-D  That's all for now.

      Okay... so... this week is going by pretty quickly.  Monday classes kinda dragged because I was really tired.  I actually dozed off in my science class.  She's so boring!  Anyhow, then I went to lunch after class, and decided to eat at Chick-fil-A.  It's all Ricky's fault because he kept saying, "It's like a little piece of Jesus with every bite."  So, I was craving some, and there I ended up on Monday.  Whilst I was there, I decided to get some science reading in since I wasn't really paying attention in class and I had time to kill before work.  And when I look up I see a rather familiar guy going to sit down.  It was Greg.  He then joined me and we had a bit of a chat about work stuff.  It was neat to hang out... however, I don't think we should do it again.  He goes on for hours about hanging out with me to everyone else.  For the next few hours at work he kept saying, "Me and Kels ate lunch together today!  We had a BLAST!"  And I'd say, "Well... I ate, then he came, and HE ate lunch while I sat there and talked to him..."  He's funny.  Okay, Tuesday flew by... Wednesday flew by... today flew by because I accidentally slept through my alarm clock.  :-(  Ooops.  Then all I had was work.  This weekend should be fun.  I'm going to Mr. Sinus with Melissa and Ricky... and maybe others?  It's Pretty In Pink... makes me think of lipstick... hmmmm.  Anyhoo... that's all for now... maybe more later... :-P

      Okay... so, I was working on a tentative webpage (thanks to geocities) today, because I don't want to forget the steps that I'll need to know in order to put together my music technology webpage quickly.  The only big difference between this and my UTSA webpage will be the UTSA one will include the midis that I've created.  OKay... so, you may go  urlLink here  if you'd like and check it out.  :-)  I also wanted to have all these pictures of friends and stuff uploaded so that I can access them to use them on my school page.  :-)  Enjoy!

      I'm so seriously enjoying my Spring Break!!!  I have NOTHING to do or worry about, and that's great!  Especially considering I've had so much to worry about and I've been so busy between school and work for the past 6 months!  I really needed the break, and I'm ever so thankful to the university Gods for granting us crazy college students a week off from all of this book-worm crap.  :-)  What's on my plate for tomorrow?  I dunno... possibly going to find a dress to wear for Easter, but I'm not sure yet.  And I really should get in some hangtime with Druck, because I don't see him enough... We'll see how that goes... maybe we'll do something tonight or tomorrow night.  What else is going on in my little world?  Well, I've decided not to pursue anything with Scuba Steve, because frankly, I don't have the time to devote to a relationship right now.  I'm doing good to spend time with my friends, and at this point in my life, they're more important to me.  I found that my crush turned out to be just that... a crush.  It was passing... OH WELL.  When my person comes along, I'll know it... and until then I'm having fun living!  :-)  I miss certain things about being in a relationship, but unless I find someone who's perfectly fine with only seeing me about 2 days a week, or they're willing to come to my house a LOT... well, then it wouldn't work out... because every night I come home pretty tired, and all I wanna do is just mellow out here.  What else?  Oh, my friend  urlLink Shannon has a blog  now.  I found it by seeing a link in his AIM profile.  Ya know, I miss that guy!  He is such a wonderful guy!!!  He could always bring a smile to my face, and he was a great conversationalist... we never had boring talks...  I hope that I can find more time to chat with him....

      Today I had a fairly productive day...  I went and picked up my paycheck from SAUM, then I came home and ate some lunch.  Then my Mom and I went to the grocery store to buy some things... needed something for dinner tonight and all.  So, tonight my Mom and I are going to make some homemade chili... MMM.  Tomorrow the plan is for me to go buy Target (I need a couple things) and I also need to go try and find some new bras.  Heh heh... I know ALL the guys who read my blog wanted to know about my bra purchasing... ; )  The rest of the week is still undetermined.  I was thinking of giving Naomi a call and going to dinner with her Wednesday or Thursday or something... I dunno.  We'll just have to see on that one.  So... a couple days ago this body was found in SA... someone was driving by and noticed something on the side of the road on fire.  They took a look and noticed it was a dead body someone had dumped off and set on fire.  So, by hearing the street names of a near intersection (both were farm roads) it sounded like it was right near the "spot" Joe and I used to go to.  I'm not sure, but I think it's very possible.  When they showed the little map thing, it really looked like it was the place.... that's so weird.  I mean, this body had two holes through the head...  Whew... anyhow... Oh... I actually did pretty well on my midterm in lab...!!!  I got a B, and I really thought there was a chance I'd end up with a D or F.  So, I came out on top with that one!  :-)  I'm just really happy that I'm getting a week of rest... and on that note, I shall go and help my Mom get dinner started here in a bit... :-P

You show people the need to rethink their assumptions, and confront them on everything from how they think to where they  build their houses. You might be one of the greatest people of all time.

      I had a nice weekend.  It started Friday night... I got some much needed rest in after studying a bit for my lab midterm, and that was quite nice.  Then Saturday I woke up early and looked over notes and such for my lab midterm.  I'm not quite sure how I did on that... :-\  No turning back now... I think I totally messed up my density one, because I don't know if he'll accept the way I converted my millimeters to centimeters.  Oh well...  I left campus and rushed home to change for Daughn's bridal shower.  My Mom and I left and got there right on time.  We had a nice time visiting with everyone who was there, and hearing all about how Daughn and Damian met... and then hearing Dori tell us about Deena and her fiancee and how everything's going with that.  So, it was nice.  Daughn got a LOT of stuff for her kitchen, and so everyone was joking with her that she needed to start cooking.  She joked back that she would make hot dogs and mac and cheese.  It was fun stuff and good times.  Then I came home and snacked on some chips and salsa because the only thing I had eaten was the little bit of refreshments at the shower.  :-(  Veggies, cheese/crackers, and a piece of cake just don't go that far, ya know?  So... whilst I was eating my chips and salsa, Melissa called and asked if I wanted to come over to eat dinner with them.  I told her to give me a few minutes to figure out what was going on at my house.  My Dad finally got home from cleaning up stuff around the church (Next month is the 100th anniversary, or something... and there's to be a fairly large barbeque) and ran to get he and my Mom some dinner from KFC.  So, I dropped it off and headed over to Melissa's.  We hung out around there and watched some tv while her parents went to buy stuff to make chicken fettucini alfredo.  YUM!  It was delicious!!!  We then left after dinner and desert (all of which was awesome) and Melissa, Brandon and I went to see  urlLink 50 First Dates , the new Adam Sandler/Drew Barrymore effort.  I LOVED it!  It was so cute, and was just precious!  And I have also decided to buy the soundtrack, because it had wonderful reggae/Hawaiian influenced remakes that I NEED for the summer!  :-)  Afterwards, we decided to go to the Krispy Kreme on Austin Hwy (yes, unfortunately for me that makes 2 consecutive weekends!!!) and so I indulged myself in a frozen chocolate coffee drink and one original doughnut.  Then we went over to Wal-Mart because Melissa needed a few things before she goes to Utah for a skiing trip during Spring Break.  We also decided to buy tie-dyed shirts for DMB this summer... it'll be fun stuff!  :-)  Are you hating on me?  Cause if you are, I think you need to GET OFF THIS!!!!!!!  ;)  This has become Brandon's new bad-ass catchphrase.  It's great... it's Al Pacino meets Tony Soprano.  ;)  Anyhow... we then went back to Melissa's so I could get my car and all... and I bid adieu to Melissa until next time... of which I have no idea when that will be.  BUT, I had a WONDERFUL time catching up with her and hanging out... (this is the first I've seen of her since this semester began)...  That's all... I'm done... I've typed a LOT... and I have yet to do all my laundry and such for the week.

      This should be an interesting weekend... I have a midterm in my lab tomorrow... then I'm going to rush home, change, and then head over to Daughn Bayer's bridal shower... then hopefully I can spend some time with Melissa.  :-)  Sunday, I think I'm gonna try going to church.  Depends on if I can get myself up... which will depend entirely on how late I stay up with Melissa on Saturday night.  :-)  Domino effect, ya know?  What else is going on?  I have music theory homework out the wazoo..!!!  On the upside, it should be relatively easy, because I've been analyzing a lot of Mozart Piano Sonatas in class (and by default outside, since the stuff gets stuck in my head!).  I'm also working on my webpage for my computer class.  Once it's looking better and makes more sense, I'll link to it here.  I'll have it for the rest of the time that I'm at UTSA... and probably about 2-4 years after... although I won't be able to update it because I won't have access to the server... BUT... it'll still be around!  :-)  Okay... enough... I'm done rambling... ;)  FOR NOW!

      Well, so I had an interesting weekend... On Friday night, Rob and Kathy got here to San Antonio around 9:30.  So, we hung around a bit, and visited... but then I went on to my room to do a bit of studying for my lab final (which was Saturday)... and then fell asleep while watching TV.  Saturday I woke up to say goodbye to my family.  They were all going up to my Grandma's to visit and so Rob and Kathy could look at some of my Grandma and Aunt's furniture... (because my Aunt Mary is now living in Houston with her grandkids and my Grandma is moving here to San Antonio to live with my Aunt Judy) Okay, so I got done with my final sooner than I thought, and so I headed on over to visit with them in Kerrville for awhile.  We got back to SA around 5, and then Rob and Kathy rested a bit before going over to Robert and Terry's to visit with them and some other friends.  I stayed at home to vegetate and visit with my parents.  We watched  urlLink A Mighty Wind , and then played around with the  urlLink Eggstractor  that my Grandma sent to my Dad.  HAHAHAHAHA  Let's just say it's not as good as it seems on TV.  hehe  But it was fun for all who took a turn trying to "eggstract" some of the eggs.  :-)  Then Sunday was a LONG day.  It was my church's 100th Anniversary.  Yeah, it's hard to believe that it existed then... but alas!  It did.  And all that was out there was a bunch of farms and fields.  :-)  Needless to say, it was a BIG deal, and this is why we had about 8 people shy of 400!  Yeah, and our little church is only used to having about 125-150 on Sundays.  So, it was a new experience to be sitting in the choir loft for church service.  Along with Ron and his brass quintet.  It was... loud.  But fun... and it turned out that my brother knew the tuba player.  They went to Roosevelt together.  After the service there was a panoramic photo taken out back... and then a dinner and afternoon service about the church history and such after the lunch.  It was actually quite nice.  Me and Jamey spent a lot of time together, which was very nice... it brought back memories.  We also saw Daughn and Damian a short while.  They had just gotten back from their honeymoon cruise.  They said it was nice... and stayed for awhile to say hello... but then left to go home and open presents from the wedding.  They hadn't gotten a chance last weekend before they left for their cruise.  Okay... so, in my hang time with Jamey, she and I decided to go downtown on Friday night... we're going to go to Dick's and maybe a couple other bars.  :-)  She said she's going to find me a good man... and then look for a new one for her... ;)  HEHE  She's so funny!  As for this week... things are going okay.  Today was kinda hectic.  I had my last theory and my last music tech class today... then I went to go get snack and all... and then I went over to Wal-Mart to pick up a couple things.  While I was at Wal-Mart I got a phone call telling me I had to go to another site for awhile.  That was interesting... first of all... I couldn't find it!  It was WAY down 1604 off Potranko... (that's a ways past Sea World for those that don't know) yeah, and I tried finding it on my map... but my map is like, 3-5 years old... and that school and the street the school's on... doesn't exist on it!  The neighborhood is only like, 2 years old.  So I had to call my Mom and get her help from a newer map that she had in her car.  But, when I got there, I immediately felt less stressed... and when the kids got there, they were so sweet!  I got like, 4 drawings in the hour that I was there!  Then when I finally got back to my site (30 minutes away from Mary Michaels Elem) the kids were so happy to see me... they thought I had quit and left w/o saying goodbye.  It was cute.  Steve was there... that's interesting.  It's weird to be around him... now that I don't have a crush on him anymore.  He ran into me today... that was odd... he was doing it to "prove a point" or something... hmmm.  Anyhow... that's all for now.  :-)

      -"The numbers all go to eleven. Look, right across the board, eleven, eleven, eleven and... " -"Oh, I see. And most amps go up to ten?"   -"Exactly."  -"Does that mean it's louder? Is it any louder?"   -"Well, it's one louder, isn't it? It's not ten. You see, most blokes, you know, will be playing at ten. You're on ten here, all the way up, all the way up, all the way up, you're on ten on your guitar. Where can you go from there? Where?"    -"I don't know."  -"Nowhere. Exactly. What we do is, if we need that extra push over the cliff, you know what we do?"  -"Put it up to eleven."    -"Eleven. Exactly. One louder."    -"Why don't you just make ten louder and make ten be the top number and make that a little louder?"   -"[Pause] These go to eleven."

      Man... sorry I haven't posted in awhile... :-\  I've been sorta busy this week.  I had projects up the WAZOO due this week... and I'm not done yet!  I have to do my science experiment and then type out some stuff so that I can paste it over into powerpoint and send the powerpoint presentation to my lab instructor.  BLAH!  I just wanna get it over with.  Then I have my lab final on Saturday...!  WOOHOO!  Then I think I'm driving up to Kerrville... my parents, Rob, and Kathy are going up to visit my Grandma on Saturday.  Since my Grandma's moving in with my Aunt and Uncle, she's got a lot of stuff she needs to give away.  So, she asked Rob and Kathy if they'd like her dining room table and her bed for their new house (it'll be done in August sometime)... so they're gonna go check it out and make a decision.  It'd really help them out to not have to buy some of these things.  Anyhow, I don't have work tomorrow... and I don't have much else to do... I think I'm going to tidy things up a bit... although they're still pretty spic and span from last weekend when I had people over before going to Hermann's Happiness.  Man... I'm so glad that I got things with my schedule for next Fall figured out a bit more... I'll have one MWF class (at noon) and 3 classes on Tues/Thurs in the morning hours... then one W night class (a lab with the science class that's on MWF)... adds up to 13 hours... and I may squeeze in one more class if I can... they've been adding more stuff on.  THANK GOD!  Anyhow... I'm off now... gotta get my experiment done.

      WOOHOO!  It's FRIDAY!!!  Now, there are reasons this sucks, too....  Like the fact that I have a skills test in math and I also have a test in earth science today.  That's gonna suck!  BUT, it's FRIDAY!  YAAAAAAAAY!  This means that I have a weekend in front of me, not to mention some daquiris and wine coolers ahead of me tonight!  And maybe some funnel cake... I dunno... We'll see!  And my uncle should be there, so I'll get to see him, too... making balloon animals... haha.  Ricky, remember when he made you that hat?  hahaha  That was funny.  Remember when we put all those chairs around a sleeping Jamey, and she woke up and totally freaked out...?  haha  Good times, good times.  Anyhow, I'm off to the shower and then to school/work...

Oh how I need a night out with friends that I haven't gotten a chance to hang out with in a while!  Oh how I need a daquiri and wine coolers!  Oh how I need a sausage on a stick!!!  :-\  Okay, that part is weird, but the other stuff makes PERFECT sense.  ;)  Things are going okay at school and work... I'm just really looking forward to Friday.  Thanks to all (Melissa especially) who have been checking in with me about how things are going.  :-)  Anyhow, now I'm off to bed.

      Happy Easter!  Sorry to those that I neglected this weekend... but Rob and Kathy are in town, and I hardly ever get to see them... so I'm taking advantage of the time I have...!  Tomorrow should end up being a busy day.  Well, today is too... I get to do lots of laundry and work on a project that's due tomorrow for my science class.... oh YAY!  Naomi's bridal shower was lots of fun yesterday!  I enjoyed meeting her parents and her soon-to-be mom-in-law, Valerie.  We had a lot of fun.  I possibly will have some pictures to share eventually.  :-)

      Okay... so.  Here's what's happened lately:  Greg's last day at Steubing was yesterday.  :'(  I'm going to miss him, but I pick up snack every Tuesday, so I'll see him all the time.  Now, last week he had pulled me aside and said that he talked to Vicky Dawson, our program director, and recommended me for the Primary Manager of the site.  So, last week and this week he's been having me make phone calls to inquire about absences, setting up parent's corner, staying inside alone without him and running the cafeteria, etc.  Well, so we didn't know what was going to happen with Heather, because, she's on probation for losing a child, and we didn't know if she would be demoted, terminated, or what.  Well, Tuesday she comes into work and says, "Guess what?!?!  I'm going to be Greg's successor!"  Kristen and I just looked at each other... and I told Kristen when Heather was gone that I was probably going to be putting in my two weeks because I couldn't stay there with her in charge.  I also said I didn't want to risk her losing a child, or getting in trouble (because she yells... a LOT) since I would be going for my certification in about 2 years, and didn't want anything on my record.  Okay... so... Chris said he was going to go and talk to Vicky because he didn't understand how someone who was on probation... who many of us thought would be demoted or terminated... could be promoted.  Well, he went and talked to them yesterday, because Wednesday was an absolute NIGHTMARE.  Greg let Heather have a taste of what was in store for her, and she TOTALLY f***ed up the fire drill that she was in charge of.  She also then yelled, VERY LOUDLY, at the children while we were outside.  Now, isn't that what Greg got in trouble for about a month ago???  And it was a NON-A.S.K. parent who reported it to several people in the district and at SAUM???  Yeah.  Chris also mentioned that none of us would stay, and that we'd probably all be putting in our 2 weeks shortly.... Because Kristen, Angela, and Trish said they were going to leave if she was in charge.  Well, so, Henry was at this meeting with Vicky as well... and he told Chris he'd take care of it and that he'd be out at the site later that day.  Well, here he came to the site around 5:15... and he pulled me aside and asked me what had happened Weds.  I told him what happened... and I also said I knew about her probation because she told me, and that I wouldn't stay there with her in charge because I didn't trust her to do the job correctly.  I explained my fear of things trickling downstream from things she messed up and it effecting my teaching career.... and he understood.  He then said, "I realized I made a mistake in telling her to be primary when I was out in the hallway outside the closed cafeteria doors and could hear her voice all the way out there.  We can't have that going on."  So, long story short, I'll be in charge of the site on Monday.  It should be interesting... especially since I have NO idea what Heather did with the attendance roster for next week.  Great.  I'll figure it out and all will be okay.  At least this way we won't lose the rest of our employees.  Wish me luck... I'll need it!

      WOW!  What a weekend!  I had a lot of fun visiting with Rob and Kathy!  It was so great to see them again... and it was interesting talking to them about what all's going on with me.  They were asking what my plans are after graduation... I told them I'd do one of 3 things... A) Live and work here in San Antonio, B) Live and work in Austin (or a city of very close proximity), or C) Live and work in a suburb of Houston (like Spring, TX, where they are going to live)... my reasoning for living in Austin or outside Houston would be to be closer to them.  I mean, I wanna be able to have the same type of relationship with them as my Dad and Mom do with my Uncle Scott.  And it wouldn't be the same between my parents and uncle if he didn't live here in San Antonio.  Of course, Kathy pointed out something very important... it will totally depend on whether or not I'm attached to someone at the time of my graduation.  She then asked if I was dating anyone.  And I told her she asked at an awkward time... being that I was just asked out the night before for an indefinite time in the summer by someone who I had formerly been EXTREMELY attracted to, and thought of asking out myself... but then fell out of attraction to... and then back into attraction to.  Long story... long and complicated... but yet simple.  ;)  Anyhow, she was like, "Well, date him, and bring him to Houston so we can check him out...!"  haha  She's so funny!  I'm really glad I ended up having an awesome sister-in-law!  So, they stayed here til about 6:30 last night... my apologies to Melissa and her family, as I didn't realize that they'd be in town that late.  I thought they were going to be outta here by like, 2-3pm... and that I could make it to dinner.  Then my parents, evil as they are, guilt-tripped me into helping them clean some stuff up in the backyard... one of those things was my dog... and giving an extra hand in clipping her nails.  That is a major task... anyone who knows my dog knows that she's incredibly hyper... and well, she can't sit still for too long when she's with someone.  So, it's a huge task to get her to sit still long enough to clip her nails... w/o clipping them too short and causing her to bleed all over.  Which, unfortunately, is why my Dad no longer helps clip her nails... he clipped one too short once, and still feels bad for it.  Of course, my dog soaked up all the attention she could get from him being guilty... I swear, she only limped around my Dad in an effort to make him feel VERY badly.  Anyhow, that's how my Memorial Day was spent.  I don't have anything to do this week, but next week I have to go to the office on Tuesday.  Then I don't have anything to do til the following Monday.  In which I will see MANY people from work.  Should be interesting.  Unfortunately, Steve will not be at any training stuff... because he won't be working with ASK next schoolyear, and doesn't need to train.  :-(  Oh well... I'll see him around outside of work.  He is, however, working summer camp @ Thornton.  Ya know, it hit me the other day... he will have been the first guy I've dated since Eric that has been YOUNGER than me.  HAHA  He's about 1-1/2 years younger, actually.  Well, anyhow, I need to play some music and feel better... so I'm gonna go play guitar a bit.  :-)  Last night was the first time I'd picked up my guitar in about a month... I missed it so much...!  Surprisingly, I am still doing quite well... and my fingers didn't hurt a lot when I was done playing for about an hour.  COOL!

      Well, I did a TON of cleaning today... and I went over to the main office to pick up my paycheck at like, 9am.  I actually had fun cleaning today.  I cleaned in my room, did some laundry, and cleaned the bathroom.  Right now Rob and Kathy are here (they just got here about 45 minutes ago)... and I'm pretty happy all around, considering the events which unfolded yesterday.  :-)  Now I'm gonna go... my brother has some surprise for me stowed away in his car... and the unveiling is about to take place.  :-)  YAY!

        Small steps, mi amigo...    Okay, so today went really smooth at work!  All the kiddos were gone by 6, which was good... Took us all about 10 minutes to load up the cars with the stuff, and drive it over to the support center.  Then we unloaded everything and checked stuff in... and realized... we forgot the napmats.  So I drove back to pick them up... before I went, I invited Steve to come along with us to EZ's on Bandera @ 410.  The rest of the gang went on there, and I went and dropped off the mats.  I met up with them, and Steve saved me a seat right next to him.  Interesting... well, so we all went and ordered some food, and sat there and chatted.  There was me, Steve, Angela, Angela's friend Stephanie, Will, Kristen and her boyfriend Leo, Samantha and her boyfriend (I forgot his name... oops), and then Greg swung by for a bit, too.  He told me some awesome news!  He and Heather (his girlfriend, not the horrid, evil one from work) are engaged!  They're gonna get married in about a year.  Well, so we all were sitting there and watching the game on tv... stupid Lakers were ahead last I saw (halftime).  Anyhow, as we were leaving, Steve said, "we should get together sometime this summer..."  So I said, "yeah, that'd be fun" and told him that I had his home number through work.  He said to give him a buzz... (I had to go and get timesheets finished up for Angela and Samantha)  Well, I knew if I gave him time, HE'D say something about hanging out.  So, we'll see where it goes.  Sidebar, he looked really cute tonight in his non-work clothes... :-)  Hehehe  Smitten Kelsie should prove to be quite fun!  :-)

        Tears will fall...   Ya know... I'm really going to miss the kiddos this summer!  I realized that I was going to feel a bit sad that I wouldn't see them everyday for 2-1/2 months, but I didn't think that it would affect me like this.  I can't sleep.  Everytime I shut my eyes, I have dreams about them... Even though I tried my hardest not to have favorites... I do.  I love them all in some way or another, honestly.  Even the ones that CONSTANTLY test me, and see how much they can get away with.  Some of the girls in the 4th/5th grade group have told me that they are going to cry when they leave.  Oh man... I don't know if I'll be able to hold it together if I have little ones that start to cry on my shoulder.  :-\  At least they'll have pictures of me to capture the memories.  They've been taking pictures with me for the past 2 weeks.  I've already had to say goodbye to a few of the kids that won't be there today... but I don't think any of this will hit me until I'm there, and I see all these kids and say to myself, "I won't see them everyday anymore... not until mid-August."      Must keep going...   I can't allow myself to totally fall apart... I have a fair amount of cleaning to do on Friday morning.  Rob (my brother) and Kathy (my sister in law) are coming in town from Houston on Friday night for the weekend.  I wish they were staying til Monday, but they decided they will leave Sunday to try and beat the Memorial Day Rush getting back to Houston.  So, I was actually thinking they were going to wanna go to  urlLink Schlitterbahn  on Saturday... and I was going to laugh in their face about it (being Memorial Day weekend and the first that ALL 3 parks were open)... but my brother said they wanted us all to go over to the  urlLink San Antonio Zoo .  It's not a really awesome zoo, but not all cities have one, and at least we have something.  And apparently the SA Zoo is one of the largest in the country.  Go figure.  I personally would rather go to  urlLink Seaworld , but I know it'd be crazy this weekend.  The zoo will probably be crazy this weekend, even.  And what's so bad about the zoo?  Not much... if you like birds.  I don't.  I'm scared of them... I don't like them looking at me, and I KNOW they can sense my fear.  So, I know that it's inevitable that my brother will FORCE me to walk through the birdcage areas with them, even though I really don't want to, and I'll end up feeling like I've gotten off a really curvy rollercoaster afterwards.  :-\  What can you do?  At any rate, I am really looking forward to seeing my bro and sis-in-law for the weekend.  And luckily, I'll get to see them again on 25 June!  We're going to Port Aransas for a week, and they're coming for the weekend.  They can't take any time off of work to stay the whole time, because they need the money.  They are fairly certain that their house in Spring, TX will be ready sooner than they thought...probably in July (as opposed to mid-late August!). Okay... that's all for now.  I'm going to attempt to fall asleep again for awhile w/o dreaming about crying kids. :'(

Of course, this sucks because no one's staying in Austin this summer... well... by no one I mean Melissa and Ricky... and it sucks because I always look forward to the summer and spending time at Ricky's house.  But this summer... nada... :-(  I guess I'll just have to go visit Patty on my own, or something.  Patty and Trinity... *sigh*  It's a sad thought... not seeing them like, every night.

      Well, stuff at work is coming to a close.  It's so strange, because I can vividly remember the very first day of work at the school.  I've come SUCH a long way since then.  Henry just told me on Friday that the reason I hadn't seen a pay increase on my checks yet was because he was waiting out on it.  Since he held out, I'll get two pay increases at once.  So, I'll have one for a promotion, and another for holding the position of site manager for 30 days.  WOOHOO!  My next paycheck should be a nice one... which is good, because then I'll have some good financial standing going into summer... I'll have a bit more money to throw around (even after car payments)!!!  :-)  Speaking of throwing money around... I had said something to Melissa about going to Schlitterbahn on Friday (since I don't have work).  So, we'll see... she'll be in town, and has a season pass.  I've decided to get one, too.  I mean, the way that training sessions worked out this summer at Urban Ministries... we'll have about 2 weeks of training, and then 2 weeks off.  This worked out perfectly for our summer vacay plans...!  My family and I are going to Port Aransas for a solid week.  Awesome!  It should be lots of fun because Rob and Kathy will come for a weekend!  :-)  Speaking of those two, they're coming next weekend to visit.  Their house is coming along quickly, too!  In one week time, the house went from a foundation, to entire structure!  They actually passed it up because they didn't think it was their house!  They just went by yesterday, and saw the dry wall panels stacked inside... so they'll be finishing off the interior walls soon, as well.  They're actually sorta hoping it takes a bit longer because they still have their apartment til Sept. I believe.  So, they'll be between the two places during mid-August to Sept.  I've told them that my gift to them will be to paint a room or two in their new home.  I'll provide the money, they pick the paint and the room... and I'll do it.  I know that I can get it done in 2 days... and it'll be a nice housewarming gift for them.  I've been sick... *sigh*  I really was afraid that I had strep throat, because a couple of our kiddos were out (sisters) last week because their mom had strep.  When I started having a sore throat on Thursday, I got a bit scared.  It went away some by Friday morning, so I didn't go see the doctor about it, thinking it was just allergies.  Well, then by Friday after work, I was feeling awful again... and so I told my Mom I would have to go to a clinic and get it checked out, because I knew I'd have to be on an antibiotic for at least a day before I could expose myself to kids.  If I waited til Monday, then I would've had to be absent from work.  So... we checked with our insurance PPO listing, and saw that I could go to TX Med Clinic and co-pay $15.  So, yesterday I went... I was in and out of there in about an hour... I'm pretty sure this is because I was covered on insurance, and they knew they'd have no trouble getting paid, and because it wouldn't take them long to check on my complaint of a sore throat.  Turns out that I was negative for Strep A (the serious one that is tested for)... the doctor offered up the idea that I had a sub category of strep (B, C, or D) or maybe a virus.  At any rate, he wrote me a prescription for amoxicillin and a pain killer.  I went and dropped off the prescription at Walgreens and went home.  My parents picked up the meds, and so I took my first pills yesterday... already today I feel 100% better!  It no longer hurts to swallow... only thing is that I'm a bit dizzy because of the pain killer I was prescribed.  I guess Darvocet does that to ya, being that it's an opiotic drug.  Hehehe... I'm high.  ;)  Other than that, I'm great!  :-)  That's all for now... comment on my highness... it's quite fun...!  I'd even go as far as saying it's better than being tipsy!  :-P

      The bar was empty I was sweeping up the floor That's when she walked in I said, I'm sorry but we're closed And she said I know, But I'm afraid I left my purse I said, I put one back behind the bar I bet it's probably yours And the next thing that I knew  There we were, lost in conversation And before I handed her her purse I said, You'll only get this back on one condition  Chorus And we danced Out there on that empty hardwood floor The chairs up and the lights turned way down low The music played, we held each other close And we danced  And from that moment  There was never any doubt I had found the one That I had always dreamed about And then one evenin' When she stopped by after work I pulled a diamond ring out of the pocket of my shirt And as her eyes filled up with tears She said, This is the last thing I expected And then she took me by the hand And said, I'll only marry you on one condition  Chorus  Like no one else had ever danced before I can't explain what happened on that floor But the music played  We held each other close And we danced Yeah, we danced   Oy... I've been on a country kick for the past couple days.  I mean... wow.  I haven't listened to this much country music since I was in elementary school!  This is  We Danced  by Brad Paisley... it's a very sweet song... very UNREALISTIC... but very sweet.  ; )  That's all...

I woke up early (8am) so that I could take my car for an oil change and such at Saturn... yeah... along with other concerns I had that I wanted to get checked... it took me about 2 hours... But at least there were free doughnuts and coffee and TV.  :-\  Okay, that's not MUCH consolation.  I did get to flirt with a cute mechanic.  THAT DOES COUNT!  He was pretty cute... most latin guys are (to me, at least).  Hmmm... so, someone should give me some advice on what I should do about the Steve situation.  I think I may start to like him again if I'm around him another week.  He's been hanging around me a lot.  Friday he came and sat with me for about 45 minutes just to "hang out."  At least, that's what he told Angela (another gal that works at Steubing) when she asked what he was doing with me.  "I'm hanging out with her... Kelsie is the best..."  What does that mean?  Kelsie is the best... the best what?  The best rack of tits at ASK... the best manager... or just the best... person?  *sigh*  I don't get it... I don't understand what he wants from me.  I mean, that's not the only thing... He also came and had snack with me... and helped me do a number of things... this is all instead of going with the kids. Before anyone gets all in a tizzy about why am I letting him just leave kids alone, we were OVERSTAFFED (first time in MONTHS) since he was there.  Technically, we haven't needed him.  So one of the newbies was coupled up with him in a group of the older kids.  PLUS, Friday was early release day, and we started out with like, 50 kids (as opposed to 75).  Yeah... okay... ADVICE... SERIOUSLY!  I don't know what to do.  I think I'm starting to be okay with the idea of dating him again... but I dunno if I should do that.  He's not coming back to ASK next school year (he's going to focus on school so he can be done... he'll be starting as an EMT after next semester if he gets it done)... so I wouldn't have to worry about that whole "we work together and I'm sick of you" thing... or the "we can't date because I'm your superior" thing that ASK is against.  **SIGH**  Leave comments... lots of good ones!

       Weekend Adventure   Well, this weekend was quite interesting!  Melissa is finally 21... and trust me she showed us how 21 she could be!  :-)  Friday/Saturday at Midnight we went down to 6th street for her to get her free shots.  We had an awesome time.  I got a bit tipsy, and had a great time.  Melissa... well... she was drunk... but we won't talk about events of that night unless she doesn't mind.  I don't want to upset her if she doesn't want everyone to know about the events of that night, minus the people who were there to see it all unfold.  Okay, then Saturday was her birthday party at Travis Lake (at Brianna's lakehouse).  I had a good time, til about 7ish when I started feeling REALLY sick.  I made it through the rest of the night (after spewing)... and when we got back to the apts. around 1am, I just fell asleep on the couch.  Yesterday I still felt a bit groggy and such, but today I'm feeling like normal again.  I don't know what it was that got me so sick.  I think it was a combination of spicy sausage, sugary soda (that I'm no longer used to since I drink diet now), and some motion sickness action from sitting on the moving dock.  At any rate, I'm better now, and that's all that matters at the moment.  I'd like to thank everyone who was concerned about me that night, and found ways to help make me feel better.  And I'd also like to say a thing about Ruthie right here and now:  She is an incredibly, wonderfully NICE person!  I have never met someone only twice and had them show that much concern for my wellness before.  :-)  Okay... now I must go.  I'm gonna eat a bit of breakfast and then get ready for work... eventually.  :-)

      Oh HELL YEAH!  I'm DONE with this semester....!!!!  Not to mention... I'm DONE with music theory classes for the rest of my life!!!  Unless, of course, I decide to go back to school to study music some more.  ;)  As much as I complained about this semester... I'm going to miss so much about it!  Especially MWF Brunch with Sandy, Bridget, and Naomi!  And, next semester when Naomi and I hang out... she'll be a married woman!!!  =-O  OMG!  That's such a weird thought!  I'll also have something to post after work tonight.  There's some stuff going on at the site... long story short, I think Chris is going to be terminated... because he's been picking on kids.  I mean, he's been doing it all year long... but now that I'm manager there... I'm not going to let it happen anymore.  I must admit, I feel sorta bad.  People probably look at things and think that I'm the one getting people fired.  I may be a tattler in a way... but it's about VERY important alleged actions.  I mean, we can't have stuff like what Heather and Chris are doing go on at the site.  It's a little thing called negligence... and that can NOT happen in childcare or pretty much EVERYONE at the site goes down with it.  And I don't want that to happen.  Not to me, and not to the 2 other people pursuing teaching careers.

      I'm almost done... I'm off to bed now for my last final (it's at 7:30am...!)  then I'll be done!  I took my music technology final 2 times and averaged a B on it... better than nothing... Everything weighs out equally for the final grade in that class.  I've done pretty okay, surprisinglly.  *sigh*  Sleep now.  Blog post later.

      1 down... 2 more to go (well, 3, but my music tech one is on the web... and I can take it anytime before Thurs)... Wish me luck!  And GOOD LUCK to all those that are taking finals... I miss seeing Shawn's little icon on AIM at Finals time... You know... the one with the devil (appropriately labeled "finals") and a poor little guy getting it in the ass from the devil (fantastically labeled "me").... *sigh*  Those are some good finals studying memories... ;)

      Oh... I had a VERY lazy day today...!  I woke up pretty late (around 11:45) and made a VERY large homemade biscuit.  Then my Mom got home from church... and we looked at some of the Sunday ads.  Then I called in an order to Grant St. pizza... and picked it up 20 minutes later.  After I had a couple slices (which were absolutely delicious) I watched the Spurs game.  Thank GOD they kicked some ass!  After that, I looked over a few notes for my exam tomorrow.  Then my Mom and I went over to WalMart of FM78 to get some more low car ice cream for my Dad and to look for some medicine that she couldn't find at the Wally World on Austin Hwy.  When we got back home, I watched some more tv... and that brings me to now.  I haven't done a damn thing today!  I mean, I have... but I haven't.  Now I shall go to do MORE of nothing... that is because I have a LOT of time to study tomorrow... :-)  Yay...!

      I'm just kinda taking it easy today... I'm about to go out... I mean, I DID just pull in a $300 paycheck... so I decided to freshen up my makeup bag... so I'm out to find some new colors for spring/summer AND to replenish my basics... I may even spring for a spiffy new makeup bag and some brushes... :-)  Yeah... looking pretty matters to me... I'm vain, what can I say?  Other than that, everything's going fine... oh... yesterday a certain Steve Gonzales sat next to me and sang me a song while playing guitar... yes... well... while that's interesting and all... it didn't amuse me.     Interesting how now that I'm no longer interested... he seems so much more adamant about making his interests widely known.  Oy... in the meanwhile, I've had my eye out for cuties...  There is this REALLY hot 4th grade teacher at Steubing... I mean... HOT!  :-)  While I would never have a chance with him... just his presence for eye candy is nice.  I think I need a hot summer fling to spice up my life.  Who knows?  Maybe I'll strike something up with Nick if his intentions are to stay with A.S.K.  I'll be at all the training sessions... so if he's still with the company I'll see him a lot.  ;)  Or maybe someone else will catch my eye.  :-P  hehe

      I'm leaving tomorrow to go to Port Aransas for a week.  :-)  I'm so glad to be going... it'll be a good escape from everything hectic that has gone on... work has been crazy... LIFE has been crazy.  I'm ready to just hang out with my family, play in the Gulf, and lay in the pool!  Then, when we get back, Rob and Kathy will be coming here to SA for 4th of July weekend... and it's going to be SO nice to see them again.  2 weekends in a row!  :-D  Then, I just need to get through one week of work stuff, and then I'm going to stay with Melissa for a 4 day weekend.  That'll be nice.  And then it'll only be a couple weeks before my birthday.  I still have no idea what I wanna do for my birthday... but I wanna do something.  Maybe just go to the Riverwalk or something... I dunno... we'll see.  I also want to get a weekend job after I return from Austin... if possible.  I need some extra money.  As it is, I need to borrow money from my parents to pay my August car payment b/c my hours got cut at work, due to low enrollment in training classes... and classes being cancelled.  So... yeah... lots going on.  I need to call Naomi back, too... It's hard to believe she'll be married in less than 2 months!  She called me yesterday hoping to go hang out next week, I need to call her back and hopefully schedule in some time for when I'm back from Port A. to hang out... yay!  :-)  Okay, I need to get back to packing stuff... :-)  More when I return, and probably some good pictures posted up, too...!

      So, earlier today, my Mom came in my room to play some games on the computer (this has been going on for about 1-1/2 years... and will continue til she finally just orders her own Dell computer... which has been the talk going on for the past 1-1/2 years!) and so I put on a jazz cd.  I put on the Ron Wilkins cd that I have... and "A Night in Tunisia" came on... it made me think of being in HS... and arriving early at school so I could sit in the bandhall and listen to the jazz band rehearse on a Monday morning... this was because Ben Rockstroh had asked me to come so he'd have a face to look at while Smith yelled at the Saxaphones during their rehearsal of "A Night in Tunisia."  It took them forever to play it at tempo. Memories.  I really miss being in high school... this has been a feeling that I've encountered a lot in the past 3-4 months.  I mean, being 22/23 has its perks... believe me.  But, I also miss the simplicity and carefreeness that comes with being 15-18 and in high school.  :-\  It was at this point that an older friend of mine suggested that I sounded as if I was going into my quarter life crisis, and sent me a poem thing.  Some of the things are VERY MUCH on my mind, while others aren't yet, because A) I like the job I have/profession I'm going into (til I become a mommy, that is), or B) I'm not done with school yet (but it IS on the horizon, believe it or not... I know what I have left as far as classes).  Check out the poem, tell me what you think... I think this could explain my mind and how it's been the past semester/few months better than I ever could:  They call it the "Quarter-life Crisis." It is when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that there are a lot of things about yourself that you didn't know and may not like.   You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but then get scared because you barely know where you are now. You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close to aren't exactly the greatest people you have ever met and the people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones.   What you do not realize is that they are realizing  that too and are not really cold or catty or mean or insincere, but that they are as confused as you are.   You look at your job. It is not even close to what you thought you would be doing or maybe you are looking for one and realizing that you are going to have to start at the bottom and are scared. You miss the comforts of college, of groups, of socializing with the same people on a constant basis. But then you realize that maybe they weren't so great after all.   You are beginning to understand yourself and what you want and do not want. Your opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and find yourself judging a bit more than usual because suddenly you realize that you have certain boundaries in your life and add things to your list of what is acceptable and what is not.   You are insecure and then secure. You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared and confused. Suddenly change is the enemy and you try and cling on to the past with dear life but soon realize that the past is drifting further and further away and there is nothing to do but stay where you are or move forward.   You get your heartbroken and wonder how someone you loved could do such damage to you or you lay in bed and wonder why you can't meet anyone decent enough to get to know better. You love someone but maybe love someone else too and cannot figure out why you are doing this because you are not a bad person. One night stands and random hookups start to look cheap and getting wasted and acting like an idiot starts to look pathetic.   You go through the same emotions and questions over and over and talk with your friends about the same  topics because you cannot seem to make a decision. You worry about loans and money and the future and making a life for yourself and while winning the race would be great, right now you'd just like to be a contender!   What you may not realize is that everyone reading this relates to it. We are in our best of times and our worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out. We are making a lot of mistakes, but helping one another learn from them and reaching out to pull one another up. We are not the shiniest group of people, but we are very much a circle. We  are there for one another and will listen and grow for the rest of our lives. We will piss one another off, but we will also heal one another's hearts.  We are the group who sometimes doesn't need words but will laugh at the end of a conversation that started with angry words. We are friends and in 10 years, when we have figured out where we fit in in this world, we will still be friends always and forever!

      Well, today I've been cleaning my room and doing laundry.  Tomorrow I'm supposed to help paint a room... and then Sunday, hopefully I'll be able to wake up and go to church.  Then next week I just have training on Tuesday... I'm facilitating 2 sessions in the morning... and then Thursday is when me and the family leave to go to Port Aransas.  :-)  We're staying a whole week!  I'm so excited... I really need the vacation... and hopefully I can get enough alone time.  I wanna print out a bunch of guitar chords to songs I like, so that I can play a lot while on vacation... and I also want to try working on some songs that I've been playing.  Just instrumental intrelude type of acoustic stuff.  :-)  It's peaceful... and I'll get to spend some time with Rob and Kathy!  :-D  I'm SUPER excited about that.  And I'll see them 2 weekends in a row, because they're coming for 4th of July, too... we're all going over to Kim and Tim's... and I think I'll stay the night... ya know... Redneck Independence Day celebration... beer and fireworks... just like the other year!  :-)  What else?  Oh, then the weekend after that (2nd in July) I'll be visiting Melissa in A-town!  HOORAY!  Hopefully I'll get to see her this weekend, as well... I need to give her back her bracelet that she left here like, 3 months ago.  And it'll just be nice to see her some... finally making the time to see her regardless of anything else...

      Helped out at VBS (Vacation Bible School) tonight... that was... interesting.  The people who are running it this year... well, they put it off til the last minute and it shows... big time!  The music program is pretty bad... the whole program is pretty bad.  They have ALL age groups doing music at once.  That is impossible to do... and I know, because I've worked with kids forever... you have to do things in different age groups... the little kids don't learn at the same rate as the 4-5th graders... ya know?  Oy... tomorrow I have training stuff... so that should be interesting...  Okay... back to talking with Melissa...

      Well, let's see... Not much has been going on other than work.  This week is the first week of training (last week was work projects and a few meetings that I had to attend).  I think I may go to the lake tomorrow during the day... then training orientation is at 6:30 at the office.  That should be interesting. Well, the only other thing I really wanted to blog about from this past week was about  urlLink Ray Charles'  death.  He died on Thursday, 10 June 2004.  I'm just glad that I got to see him in concert before he died.  I saw him in 2003 @ the rodeo.  That is all for now

      It's officially flooding in San Antonio... oh YAY!  Honestly, I've always LOVED thunderstorms... they're comforting to me... so, I've been in Heaven... but it DOES kinda bum me out, because I wanted to try and go out to Canyon Lake next week, and I dunno if I can... given that it's been raining so much.  I dunno if it's gonna get flooded out over there.  Hopefully the forecast is correct and it won't be raining anymore after today... but Texas weather (as we all know) is very unpredictable... so, who knows what'll happen in the next few days.  Other than that, all is going well... Weather like this puts me in a cleaning mood... so I'm doing laundry and tidying up my room.  :-)  Tomorrow I have a meeting at the office at 11am w/ Henry and other training facilitators... then I also need to talk to Will, because some of the training I was going to do in August got cancelled... :-\  ARGH!  Now I'm gonna have to redo my training hours... Again.  But, I also can't take a lot of training before July 14 (my hire date)... I'm only allowed to take like, 6 hours of training... and the bulk of my training in August was cancelled... so, it sounded like I'd be out about 10-15 hours... GREAT!  I'm hoping that I can just get credit for other stuff I facilitate... that'd be nice.  I'm sure everything will work out fine...

      So, I'm on the down and outs with the 'rents today.  Yeah... I came to the conclusion it's from being around them so much lately.  I haven't been working during the week b/c school's out... and so I'm around them more now.  I'm not used to being around them for more than 2 or 3 days at a time.  I dunno... this means that vacay for a solid week with them should be REALLY interesting.  I'm thinking that there will be several fights, judging from today.  I dunno... I've also been sorta sad... internally.  If that makes any sense, lemme know.  What I mean is... externally (as far as Steve and all goes) I've been really happy.  But then internally, I'm really missing my friends and all.  In the past I've gotten so used to seeing them everyday... and no guy could ever fill the void I feel when I don't get to spend summertime with my friends.  :-(  I dunno what I should do.  I could hang out with Steve more... but that's not gonna fix this sad feeling.  I need to spend time with my friends...!!!  UGH!  I don't wanna feel this sad feeling inside anymore... I need to figure out when I can go visit the group in Austin.

      Well, so I haven't been doing anything, as I'm done with the school year... just been lounging around.  I have a meeting tomorrow with Henry (my direct supervisor) about the training stuff I'm helping with this summer.  I haven't seen him since last Tuesday... I was supposed to see him Thursday evening, however his Dad passed away, and so he and his wife flew to Oklahoma for a funeral.  I sent him a sympathy card on Friday... I'm glad that he and his wife are okay and don't seem to be grieving too much.  He's a pretty tough guy, though... retired Colonel, ya know... that's how they tend to be.  Anyhow... I'm off to eat dinner with my Mom.  My Dad's playing golf this evening, so it's just the two of us.  I hope she got wraps from Chik-fil-A.  Those are my FAV!  :-)

      I had a WONDERFUL birthday!&nbsp; Thank you to everyone who wished me well today, it was quite nice of&nbsp;you!&nbsp; :-D&nbsp; I had a very leisurely day, my Mom baked me a cake, and she came home from running a few errands with a new down comforter for me... it was very nice.&nbsp; Then my brother called to wish me happy birthday, and then after awhile, my Dad.&nbsp; Well, when my Dad got home, we all&nbsp;decided after seeing the weather report (which said it was going to poor in about an hour from when we saw it) we decided to head over to Reb Lobster then.&nbsp; Plus, we were all hungry.&nbsp; So we went over, and I ordered up a pina colada/strawberry drink... it was delicious.&nbsp; Then when the gal got back with our drinks, we ordered dinner.&nbsp; And, since it was my birthday, I decided to try some lobster, because I never had and well, my Dad was like, "If you don't like it, it won't go to waste, I'll eat it..."&nbsp; So, I got popcorn shrimp and lobster tail.&nbsp; Oh, man... everything was delicious!&nbsp; The lobster was VERY tasty.&nbsp; I found that I like it with a lot of lemon... and no butter.&nbsp; Odd... although, the butter was better when I added about 1/2 a lemon's worth of juice to it and made lemon butter.&nbsp; YUMMY!&nbsp; It was good... my parents and I shared it, because there's no way I could've eaten it all on my own.&nbsp; In fact, I didn't finish my food... I had most of my rice left, and about 1/5 of my shrimp.&nbsp; But, it was good!&nbsp; Well, so then we came back home, and I went over to Jennifer's to get my scarf she made me... it's BEAUTIFUL!&nbsp; Thank you so much Jennifer... I love having things that people make me!&nbsp; While I was there she played some violin... that was pretty enjoyable, and rather funny... but not in a BAD way.&nbsp; Anyhow, then I came back home, and my parents and I ate some cake.&nbsp; And now, I'm going to go play some Age of Empires II and then head to bed.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; Night night all, thanks for making my birthday absolutely wonderful.&nbsp; And more is to come Saturday!&nbsp; :-D

       Happy Birthday, Kelsie... I'm quitting.  Good news:&nbsp; Finished all my paperwork today.&nbsp; Bad news:&nbsp; Teresa is quitting.&nbsp; :'(&nbsp; I'm so sad about this, because she and I have really grown close and built a really good friendship... and I'm going to miss her terribly.&nbsp; She was a wonderful guide for me in the workplace, as well as for when I begin teaching (she has a degree in reading, and teaching reading (now) at a school here in town).&nbsp; Thankfully, I got her phone number, and she told me to stop by and see her Friday before I leave from getting my paycheck, because it's her last day.&nbsp; :-(&nbsp; She said, "I can't let you go without getting one more hug from my Kels..."&nbsp; And she was crying, and I was crying... and it was just HORRIBLE!&nbsp;

      Ugh!&nbsp; I'm not done with all the paperwork.&nbsp; I need my staff members to help out, but I can not have them paid if they come and help me b/c our non-profit org. can't afford it right now.&nbsp; :-\&nbsp; Dang it!&nbsp; So, I have pretty much 5/8 of my paperwork to do tomorrow in 1-1/2 hours.&nbsp; I just have to go in there with the frame of mind that I'll finish it.&nbsp; I have to get it done.&nbsp; It's extremely important to have the emergency cards done soon, because we're gonna have to make copies of them to go outside with the groups when they go outside for outdoor play.&nbsp; (sigh)&nbsp; I hope I finish it tomorrow.&nbsp; Thankfully we have a lot of siblings, and since there are 4 cards to a page, then I can just look at the other kid's info and put it down for the other one (or two as the case sometimes is).&nbsp; So... Thursday, 29 July, I turn 23.&nbsp; Probably all I'm doing for that day is going out to eat.&nbsp; My parents were going to take me for seafood.&nbsp; YUM!&nbsp; I think we're just going to go to Red Lobster... I want some shrimp and lobster!&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; Then this weekend I'm doing something with all my friends.&nbsp; Don't really know WHAT yet, but something.&nbsp; Possibly going dancing... really depends on what goes on Saturday and how much we get done (we're helping the guys move to their new townhome in Austin!)... So, yeah... I'll post later, I need a nap.

      My mom and I went up to Kerrville, TX today to my Grandma's for a little visit.&nbsp; We left San Antonio about 11:00, and we ended up at my Grandma's about 12:30 because we stopped to get some lunch for us all.&nbsp; So, we all sat down for lunch and had some good conversation, and then my Mom and I went over to my Aunt Mary's old place b/c we were going to look at a headboard and night stand that she wants to get rid of, as well as the full size mattress and boxspring.&nbsp; My Grandma felt bad because there was a loss of memory regarding HER full size bed/boxspring... and so she knew my Aunt Mary (who's now living in Houston, TX with her grandkids b/c she needs full time care) wanted to get rid of it and asked her if my friend Melissa could take it instead.&nbsp; OKAY, so... We went back over to my Grandma's and talked for about 1-1/2 hours.&nbsp; We were asking her what she's going to do with all her stuff, because she'll be limited on space when she moves to San Antonio.&nbsp; For those of you that don't know, she's moving here to San Antonio into an added on "house" to my Aunt Judy's.&nbsp; My cousin Kim's husband (Tim) has connections in construction.&nbsp; So he got a plumber buddy and a drywall buddy and several other "buddies" to commit to only charging my Grandma for supplies and not labor.&nbsp; Essentially she's paying 1/3 the cost it normally would've costed her.&nbsp; So, her little space is about done... she'll have a bedroom area, a living area, and her bathroom will also have a washer and dryer in it and a large amount of closet space for her clothes.&nbsp; She's getting anxious about moving, and she realized today there's no way she can take all her beloved pictures.&nbsp; She made a very sad comment regarding them saying, "I'll just leave them here, and when I die YA'LL can all take care of them."&nbsp; Given the fact that last September she had a heart attack and almost died, I don't like to hear her say stuff like that.&nbsp; Anyhow, I go into the office tomorrow for some paper work... I'll be filling out emergency cards for all the kiddos at my site!&nbsp; Kinda makes me excited, but at the same rate very STRESSED about all I have to get done the first 2 weeks of August before school starts&nbsp;(16 Aug.) for them.&nbsp; Plus, we're trying a new rotation program this year, so I'm hoping that all the craziness with that dies down before MY classes start 25 August.&nbsp; And, I'd like to be able to enjoy myself when I go to the  urlLink Dave Matthews Band  concert in Houston on 21 August with my sister in law Kathy!&nbsp; I wanna be able to have fun, and possibly get some stuff done at their house.&nbsp; I said I'd paint a room for them.&nbsp; I think I signed away my soul...  A  room will probably turn into 2-3 rooms .

      I went shopping with Jennifer today... I bought some new khakis for work and a new brown leather dressy purse for about $40 at JCPenney's.&nbsp; They're having a store closing b/c they're moving to Rolling Oaks Mall.&nbsp; Then we looked around the rest of the store a bit.&nbsp; It was nice to spend some time with Jennifer... at first she told me I was acting like a bored boyfriend... but I have to ease into shopping.&nbsp; Especially if there's a crowded store b/c of a major sale.&nbsp; Jennifer wanted to throw her gum wrapper at some innocent little boy.&nbsp; After he had been sitting there awhile, he was getting bored waiting for his Mom.&nbsp; So, he got his socks (which I guess were for the new schoolyear), and started making them fight.&nbsp; Jennifer was like, "OOOOOH!&nbsp; Sock monsters!"&nbsp; He looked up a sec, and then put the socks down.&nbsp; I think she was freaking him out.&nbsp; At one point, he dropped all his clothes off the prop bed (we were sitting on a prop bed also&nbsp;waiting for Lenny) and Jennifer let out a HUGE burst of laughter... from what I remember, it was in relation to something she said... but the little guy thought it was from him dropping his clothes.&nbsp; His little cheeks turned red, and he quickly picked up the clothes, and then hung his head in embarassment.&nbsp; It really was rather entertaining for 15 minutes.&nbsp; Then we went over and Jennifer looked at some beds b/c she wants a new one...&nbsp; Not one salesperson came over to inquire about helping us... I think it's cause they thought we were a lesbian couple looking for a new bed.&nbsp; But, who knows for sure...&nbsp;Lenny got there, and then we went and paid for our stuff.&nbsp; After we were done I called my Mom and had her call in the order to Grant St.&nbsp; I went and picked up the pizza... and it was so delicious!&nbsp; Me and my Mom are now STUFFED... so I'm gonna go finish vegging with her in front of the TV.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; Laters...

      So, I went and got a  urlLink haircut  today.&nbsp; It's really just a trim.&nbsp; The ends of my hair were very dead, and needed some help.&nbsp; So, I decided I should go get it trimmed and have my face frame done again.&nbsp; So, yeah... it looks pretty much the same, which is good.&nbsp; I didn't want it to change too much b/c of Halloween.&nbsp; I'll cut it more after that.&nbsp; :-)

      I just had a wonderful conversation with Justin!&nbsp; It was nice to catch up with him... I haven't had a nice long conversation with him in months... and I always feel like I have so much more insight to the direction I want my life to go after I hang up the phone with him.&nbsp; By "direction" for my life, I mean spiritually.&nbsp; And I use that term very lightly... because I'm by NO means a person who preaches religion to people... but I realize that I need to devote more time to God and such.&nbsp; I'm not going to start trying to get friends of mine to go to church more, or anything either... or look down on people who aren't going to church.&nbsp; But, for myself, I need to get the church life I once knew back.&nbsp; I think it'd be in my best interest to involve myself in the youth group... and/or go to church with Naomi and Clint on Sundays.&nbsp; Anyhow... we also just had a good conversation.&nbsp; He told me all about how he proposed and all... it was just nice.&nbsp; I miss my long chats with Justin.&nbsp; I miss the time(s) that we would sit and talk until 5am about our lives and what we wanted to do with them.&nbsp; Okay, that's all I really have for now... Ricky should post something on his blog... he's got some interesting things to tell about our adventures the past 3 days.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; HAHA&nbsp;

      So, I woke up this morning, had some breakfast, fed the cat, and then decided to go out and give Dioji a bath.&nbsp; Now, I am a creature of habit.&nbsp; And being a creature of habit I, apparently, locked the handle of the door from the house to the garage.&nbsp; :-\&nbsp; Ooops.&nbsp; Okay, my parents went to Kerrville to my G-ma's... yeah.&nbsp; So, I had no way back inside.&nbsp; I began brainstorming.&nbsp; "Mom keeps that window to the patio room cracked open.&nbsp; I'll pop the screen off and get into the house that way..."&nbsp; Yeah, I made it through the window (a feat I am very proud of, considering I'm not a size 5 and the window is about 5 feet off the ground... it's just lucky for me that I'm flexible) but the door from the patio room to the house was... yes, that's right... locked.&nbsp; So, I decided at this point, "well, I'll just jump through the other window from the patio room to the house..."&nbsp; yeah, it had a stick keeping it from being opened all the way.&nbsp; So, I then went back to the garage and began looking for something thin enough to stick in the door and pry the thing open.&nbsp; I found a screwdriver... that one didn't work.&nbsp; I looked for a smaller one... and that did.&nbsp; In all, it took me about 10 minutes to break into the house 2 times and attempt breaking into the house 2 times.&nbsp; I should break into houses for extra money!&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; haha&nbsp; Anyhow, the dog's nice and clean, and I've run 2 loads of laundry... I'm really feeling accomplished today (so far)!

      The  urlLink kitchen's  finally done... thank goodness!&nbsp; It looks really nice (there are a couple pictures via the link).&nbsp; We had to get plain curtains for the window, because we weren't willing to pay $60 for the curtains we actually wanted from Linens n Things.&nbsp; On a different note, we got towels at Kohls for very cheap.&nbsp; Just thought that those of you that need anything new may wanna know... 'cause Kohls is having a sale til Sunday where select things are 50-60% off.&nbsp; Anyhow... okay, that's really all I've got.&nbsp; The only things I've done this week are paint and work.&nbsp; Tomorrow's a full day too... possible trip to Kerrville for something and then lots of laundry and I need to wash the stinky dog.&nbsp; So... yeah... ta ta.

        Awesome time in Austin    I had an awesome time in Austin with everyone.  I wish Druck could've been there, but that's my only complaint about the weekend.  I got there Thursday evening, around 8ish.  We watched some tv, and hung out around the girl's apt.  After awhile Ricky and Wolf decided to go to the pool, and the rest of us (Jennifer, Melissa, Brandon, and I) decided to go down to the billiards room to shoot a bit of pool.  Little did we know that the cue stick was going to be a POS.  It had no tip... but we made it work.  After such, Melissa and I went back to the apartment, and Jennifer and Brandon stayed to play a bit more.  Ricky came over to get his wallet and keys, and ended up staying long enough to eat some chicken and dumplings my Mom sent with me.  Then, after showers, we all retired for the evening.  Friday morning Melissa went to work... when she got back we decided that she, Amy, Jennifer, Brandon, and I wanted to go see  urlLink Anchorman .  So, after bumming around the apartment awhile and watching some Chapelle Show, we left around 6ish so that we could go to Target for Melissa to buy season 1 of Reno 911!!!  But it wasn't at the first Target we went to, so she called one somewhere else (near Hyde Park) to make sure they had it.  We went to eat at  urlLink Hyde Park Bar and Grill ... and I must say thank you to Amy Tao for suggesting it!  They have wonderful fries, and my turkey burger was awesome.  After dinner (where Ricky and Wolf joined us for a bit) we ran over to the other Target so Melissa could buy  urlLink Reno 911 , and then went on to the theater.  The movie was AWESOME!  Everyone who likes Will Ferrel should see it!  We went back home, watched a couple Reno episodes, and then Brandon and I went to sleep so the rest of the gals moved into Melissa's room for more Reno.  Saturday Melissa, Amy, and Jennifer went to look at a house with Briana, and Brandon and I stayed at the apartment.  I took a shower, Brandon watched tv.  Then we watched Outbreak (it was on tv)... when the girls got back, we had some grilled cheese (thanks again, Amy) and watched more Reno... Jennifer and Melissa took naps... Amy went to hang with her friend Heather.  When Melissa and Jennifer awoke, we went and got some grub at Taco Cabana... then came back to the apartment.  The boys came over after a bit (they had been house hunting) and we finally decided to go shoot some pool at the  urlLink Union Underground .  It was nice... and good fun.  Even though most of us STINK at pool.  :-)  And it was only $4 a person for 2 tables for nearly 3 hours!  Quality time.  Today was a kinda lazy day... everyone but me left to go look at a house on Eilers... which happens to be Melissa, Amy, Jennifer, and Briana's house for next year.  Congrats, girls!  Then Brandon and I ran to Subway to get some lunch... then were lazy til we left.  Jennifer left about 3:30... Brandon and I left around 5ish.  It was a quality weekend, I must say.  Hopefully we can have more of this during this next schoolyear!  :-)  If Ricky comes to town this weekend, I think we're gonna hit up downtown and check out some places.  Plus, we need a Bambino Huey from the Landing!  ;)  He knows what I'm talking about.... don't ya... BITCH?!  :-)  I'll stop with the bitch stuff... No more Chapelle Show for me!

      Well, I went into work today... for training.  Had the class with both Kristen and Angela.  That was fun stuff.  I haven't seen them in a few weeks... so it was nice to hang out with them a bit.  And the class was about games and manipulatives... so we got to play with stuff for 2 hours.  :-)  Tomorrow I'm facilitating a class from 3:15-5:15... then I'm coming home to pack up some stuff and go to Austin till Sunday evening.  Should be loads of fun!  :-)  Jennifer's going up, and to my understanding Druck will be up there too... Which means, this is the first time since Christmas that our whole group has hung out together.  Weird.  Anyhow... I think I'm going to do a bit of laundry tonight... so I have clothes in Austin... and tomorrow before I go into work, I really should try to swing by the library and get my book renewed... maybe two.  I only read 2 of the books (Elvis book and Louis Armstrong book)... and I'm about half done with Little Women.  But I still wanna read Interview with the Vampire.  So I think I'll renew LW and IwtV.  *sigh*  I realized in the past couple weeks how much I miss reading.  I haven't done a whole lot because I always have stuff to read for school.  And it's hard for me to read things I need to read if I'm reading things I want to read.  I don't put the wanted aside for the needed.  :-(  Oh well... anyhow... that's all for now... I'll possibly post again while in Austin... else my next post will be when I get back.  :-)  Have a nice weekend and such!  :-)

Hope you have a nice day with families, friends, and lots of people you don't even know (if you go see fireworks, that is)... :-)  After church we're all going over to my cousin Kim's house in Pipe Creek.  Woohoo!  Alcohol and fire... what more could a gal ask fer?  I'm sure that the works of fire will be a purty as anything I've eva seen!  :-)  More later...

      It's kinda hectic around here... I am cleaning up the house (just finished the family room and hall bath... next is my bedroom and some laundry) before Rob and Kathy get here.  I'm also waiting on a returned call to the office about a meeting we're supposed to have before Tuesday.  I need to call Naomi, because she called whilst I was on vacay... and Druck... he called too... and Jennifer called yesterday, apparently, but I still had my ringer off... so I didn't see that she had called til later on.  So much to do... SO MUCH.  But, next weekend should be great because I'm going to @-Town to visit Mel-dawg (and others, if they're available to hang out).  :-)  YAY!  Okay, back to cleaning... and listening to Pink Floyd.  ;)

      Well, Port Aransas was ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!  I had such a good time... I was very suprised that I didn't get really ticked off at either of my parents... however, I've really learned to bite my tongue when it comes to a lot that they comment on.  It was wonderful seeing Rob and Kathy... although, all 3 of us got sunburned on Saturday... :-(  Which made it nearly impossible for me to go and swim or anything during the day.  I'm just glad I didn't have my heart set on swimming in the Gulf... call me crazy, but I don't like having sand in areas which sand should never be.  I did a fair amount of walking on the beach, though... and I got some WONDERFUL  urlLink sunrise pictures !  We ate at many good places, and went to the aquarium, and just spent a lot of time with each other.  It was, by far, the best vacation I've had with family since I was about 10.  The only thing was that I missed my cat, Boco, TERRIBLY.  So, I was anxious just to go and get Boco and my dog Dioji.  As we pulled up we saw a peculiar  urlLink PINKness  to the front yard...  Ya see, the youth at my church are doing a fundraiser, and it involves putting this horrid, pink, yard junk in peoples' front yards.  My Mom bought some insurance (it's like, $5 to ensure you don't have them land in your yard)... however, I apparently should've gotten some too on my own.  I think it's just a loophole that they found... and I'm convinced that the "anonymous" persons are Daughn and Deena.  Those RATS!  Just wait!!!  Maybe I'll steal a tire from one of their cars!!!  ;)

      Well, things are going so fast!  I can't believe that a week from this moment I'll be recovering from the first day of ASK!  WOW!  At any rate, things are coming along nicely... tomorrow Angela, Kristen and I are picking up the stuff from the Support Resource Center at 8am and taking it over to Steubing!!!  Afterwards I'm heading home to shower and get ready for work from 1-5:15.  Yep, it'll be a full day... but, it's gotta be done.  I'm getting excited about seeing the kids again... I can't wait!  I've missed them all... even the ones that gave me a hard time last year... I really miss Josh Towell... I wonder how his summer has gone.  Anyhow, I have a pretty packed week... gotta take a few more training classes... and Thursday I'm teaching a class on "Listening to Children."  Then Friday morning I have my CPR training... (I'm planning on going over my basics and checklist beforehand so it's really easy!  I mean, my parents paid money for me to take First Aid/CPR for a reason from UTSA!)  Then from 4-6:30 Angela and I will be at a table in the cafeteria at Steubing for the "Meet the Parents" night... I'm hoping a few of the new kids' parents will stop by and say hello... I wanna start that good raport early.  I'm really excited... really, really excited!  I've gotten a bunch of little bins ready for different things... we're going to start this year nice and organized!  And it'll stay intact til May 2005... and I mean it!  Okay... I need to go to bed now... because I have to be up early as HELL tomorrow morning...

      OH YEAH!  We got 20 more kids in a week's time!  We now have 87 kids!  This means Kelsie gets a secondary and another staff member... and we'll probably cap enrollment by the end of the first week of school.  YAY!  I'm so excited... I just ordered a bunch of stuff from our curriculum dept. for positive reinforcemnt.  Stickers, candy, body glitter, rings, bracelets, cars, airplanes, bubbles... WOOHOO!  I'm awesome... and if my plans go smoothly, then I'm going to BEG some of my friends from UTSA Music Dept. (mainly the steel drum ensemble) to come perform for the kids on a Friday!  :-D  I'm awesome!

      Well, things are starting to come together for the new schoolyear of ASK.  As of now, we have 67 kids enrolled, but I'm sure we'll get a handful more next week... and a handful more the first week of school.  I'm a little tiffed right now, because I only have 3 other staff members, and apparently I'll be in ratio.  I do not want to be in ratio... that's WAY too much to expect of a site manager with over 50 kids.  So, I'm really (at this point) counting on those other 2 handfuls of enrollment... because that means I get another staff member PLUS a secondary manager.  I have so much stuff to do next week, it's ridiculous.  I have stuff to do at the office M-F again... T-Th is training stuff... Friday I have CPR training/testing for my renewal.  In addition to that, Tuesday morning I have to be at the support center at 8am to pick up stuff to take to the site... yeah... this means I get to drive the truck so that we can get all the baskets there.  :-\  I really HATE driving the truck... this is because it's HOT in Texas, and the truck has no A/C.  :-(  Oh well... such is life, I guess.  I'm really trying to find the positive in everything, though.  I'm excited to go back and see the kids... I've really missed a lot of them, and about 75% of our enrollment is repeat customers!  :-)  I'm also excited about the new program we're trying this year... and I plan on doing a lot of fun things with music and drama and such... The plan is that Friday's will be "free form" meaning, we don't have to do any projects, or homework program, or other things... so we'll be able to put on little programs!  I'm pysched... I think one of the things we're going to do is have a "club" that's like American Idol (because there are a LOT of kids interested in it) and so then on a Free Form Friday, we'll have them perform something for the whole group.  Anyhow, that's all I have for now.  Talk to you peoples later... leave comments... it's good for the brain.  ;)

      It was a long weekend, but a good one.  I went up to Austin Friday night and I got there around 8:30.  When I got there, we (the guys and I) started packing stuff up.  We started in the kitchen, and we were packing up their plates and bowls.  We noticed that there wasn't that much newspaper left, so we drove the bus route to get issues of the Texan from all the bus stops.  :-)  We got back, and we finished packing up the plates and bowls.  After that we started packing stuff from the pantry.  Man, that was fun!!!  We played basketball, throwing away stuff that was old, or bad.  We found some weird and interesting things.  Then we went to the store and got some stuff for the night and the next day (paper plates, napkins, toilet paper, a pan).  Then we came back to the apartment and cooked dinner.  Amy came over for a bit, and we hung out awhile.  Then after she left, we did some more packing... I finally decided to go to bed around 3:30am... I was really tired.  The guys stayed up all night long packing.   Saturday, the guys got up around 9:30 and left before 10 to go over to the new place and get the keys and all.  They took their hanging clothes and the T.V.s at this time, and I stayed at the apartment.  They were gone a long time, and I got bored, so I cleaned up the kitchen a bit.  I cleaned the stove, the drip pans on the range top, the window in the kitchen, the counters, the front of the refrigerator (there was old food and magnet residue all over it)... Then after awhile, Ricky's Dad got in town, so I let him in, and we started on some stuff to get things ready to pack up.  We got the sofa ready to go, and Ricky called after awhile and asked me to start on the sausage for the breakfast tacos.  So, I started on that, and then the guys got back, and Long came, too.  We ate some breakfast tacos, and started on packing around 12:45pm.  Yep, sorry to say, I wasn't much help in the actual packing up of stuff to go from Sterling to Le Montreaux... BUT, I carried my weight when we got stuff from the trailer into the apartment at Le Montreaux... Damn arthritic knee!  Going up and down 3 flights of stairs about 5-6 times made my knee begin to hurt so bad... so, I was more help once we were moving things into the new place.  :-)  At least I didn't feel COMPLETELY useless.  We finally finished all the moving around 9pm!  Man, what a long day.  But, we decided we shouldn't go out and do anything... because quite honestly I was POOPED!  I think Ricky felt kinda bad that we didn't actually go out and do anything, but we can do something all together next time I come into town.  And, there's actually a slight possibility I can come the end of August.  :-)  So, Ricky shouldn't feel bad anymore.  :-)  Anyway, we all just went to Sonic after Jennifer and Druck got there, and then we came back and we were awake a little while, and then fell asleep.  We all woke up the next day around 2pm!  haha  That's funny because I had said I wanted to leave around noon...  hehe  Anyway, once everyone woke up we decided to go eat at Fazoli's.  Mmmmm  It was so good!  Minus the fact that we didn't get more breadsticks... and I made a boo-boo when we threw away our trash... I poured a bunch of Dr. Pepper in what apparently was their bleach water solution to clean off the tables.  :-\  Ooops.  I really didn't mean it... I thought it was a little resevoir for leftover liquid so it wasn't in the bag if the bag had a rip... so it wouldn't drip all over... yeah... OOOPS!  At any rate, everyone else thought it was quite funny...  I got back home Sunday around 6:15ish... and, THANKFULLY, I fell asleep by 11:30... so I had no trouble getting up this morning to be at work at 9:15 for training.  It was a long day at work, and I was talked into teaching a class that Teresa was going to teach.  They gave me the reference book, and I got teary eyed when I saw her little notes in the book.  :'(  Anyhow, that's next week.  I have SO MUCH to do next week.  Next Tuesday we go to pick up our stuff at the support center at 8am to take it to the site and put it in our cabinets that we left there.  It's exciting, but not... then on FRIDAY THE 13TH we have the "Meet the Parents" at Steubing... we'll have a little table set up, and some brochures... which means, we'll end up with like, 20 more files the 3rd day of school... :-(  It's bad, but it's good... cause if we get our 80 kids, then I get a secondary, and I get to pull outta ratio, and get another staff member.  As of now, I'm in ratio, and that's gonna be difficult.  On the otherhand, I sorta hope that the numbers stay low, cause I'd like to have a smaller number of kids, and a more intimate relationship built up.  It's easier to devote more time to each kid.  Okay, I'm tired, so I'm gonna go to sleep now, I think.  Ooooh, and thanks Kate for letting me know your AIM sn... hopefully we can chat it up sometime.  Oh, and thank you to a certain Raccoon that is very dear to me for the special birthday present.  ;)  It made me feel quite special, I only hope that I'll get to return the gesture on your birthday!  :-)
