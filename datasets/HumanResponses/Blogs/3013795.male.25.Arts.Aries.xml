      What the?! I just finished Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow! Is it just me or is the game too short...maybe I just played too much! Well, it sure was fun! Lifespan of the game... 4 nights! I am a splinter cell!

      Ever since I started playing Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow, time it seems is never enough for it. I wanted to go on and on with it but time and concsiousness simply would not allow it. Hehehe! I've invested so much time already and enjoying every minute of it. This is my type of game, stealth... games like this are not really for everyone. It takes patience, discipline and strong will to prevent yourself from cursing too loud at 3 am in the morning. I guess I'm the only one qualified among my group of friends. Damn, I have to keep my spy stories to myself. Hehehe!

      Ahh... friday at last. i have a feeling that this will not be an ordinary weekend, who am I kidding?! It won't be! tomorrow, we'll be going to my sister's graduation at the PICC. Hmm... how come they could spend their graduation there while WE, spent ours in the school auditorium?! Jologs! That's odd... Anyway, my sister's a cum laude! I'm sure my parents are very happy, and proud like I am. Sigh... I'll be waking up early tomorrow since the rites will start at 7 am! Gotta forget about work muna for tonight... waitamminit... I've been forgetting work for three weeks already! Waaaah!

      Ahh... I'm back! it's been four days since I last updated my blog. Been a little busy and out of town this weekend.  Anyhoo, I've been waiting for the release of Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow. I might be able to play it on the PC first. I prefer playing on my PS2, I never did feel like I'm playing whenever I'm in front of the PC, same with watching a movie there, there's something missing in the whole gaming/movie experience. Although it may be graphically superior, it has a lot of complications. Buy, install, setup, play. Compared to the PS2, buy, play, no issues! And games today require a lot from your machine... I always thought my PC was strong enough to handle most games, having a 2.1 Ghz processor, 128MB GeForce FX 5200 Video card. Until I installed Deus Ex: Invisible War, my god, the framerate was horrible! So I changed the setting of the game: shadows, textures, and all those other video settings... although it ran on a forgivable framerate, the graphics suffered a lot, it just made me feel frustrated. So after that incident, I swore never to buy another PC game... well, looks like I'll give this box another chance with Splinter Cell. Its July release for the PS2 is just too long for me. Hehehe!

      Right now, I'm planning on enrolling for an  Aikido  class... probably next week, I'll start looking for a place to take em. Some people go to gyms, some to badminton sessions, some to billiard halls, me, I'll be punchin' and kickin' my way to fitness heaven! Yeah! Would've wanted to learn capoeira but I fear that my body isn't as flexible as it requires. Hope this isn't one of those plans that don't materialize. Hehehe! I have a lot of that, countless. They say that there is a moment in your life when it's divided into two, one before and one after... This may be one of those moments... hehehe!

      On the 27th, my sister will be graduating from college. At last, every parent's dream for their children has finally come true for our dearest mom and dad. I know they're proud of us, and I can sense their excitement once again. My mom almost cried this morning when she told me we're all going on the 27th, all four of us. I can almost feel her heart bursting with pride and that sense of accomplishment. Too bad she wasn't here when I graduated, she was in Taiwan but didn't fail to congratulate me that day. It makes me wonder though if I can wait THAT long for my own children's graduations. Hahaha! That's thinking too far ahead for me. Oh well... dreams are free of charge.

      Well, came home from Makati. The Moose Crew (Joey, Rey, Jet, and me) had a little meeting on the project's development. Turns out we may have to change Mooz' appearance anyway. We were instructed in the beginning NOT to change the main character's design. We anticipated this predicament but who's complaining? Well... the client, I suppose. Hehehe! I'm kind of excited to give this character a makeover, finally, some control! Nyahaha! And the client is willing to buy some character designs we may have. And that could only mean more money! Yey! $__$ I missed my Guia today... sigh.

      Today, I am all alone in this cold office. To my surprise, no one was here yet when I came in. Oh well, life goes on. I've always thought of myself as a loner. And yet, I am constantly with the company of my friends and loved ones. Not that I'm complaining. What I'm saying is, if I go out alone, I don't mind, I can manage. Before, I always tell myself, "You can never fully trust anybody but yourself." True. True. True. Later this afternoon, I'll meet up with the David sisters, Jet and Joey. Yes, you heard it right, sisters... with names more masculine than mine (Jen). Hehehe! Hopefully, this Moose Gear project would progress as planned.

      Obviously, I'm not busy. And since this is something new to me, guaranteed this will be updated daily... for a coupla weeks at least. Hehehe!   Angels and Demons  is getting really interesting... after several chapters, a lot of  Illuminati  secrets have been revealed! And these aren't just products of the author's imagination... erm... well, technically, the whole book is. But  they are actually based on facts! I looked it up on the net and was surprised to see actual documents! hmm... interesting.  Last night, I got home early. After eating, a few minutes on the phone, I suddenly found myself sleepy. Got to my room and gave in to my bed's invitation. I woke up with the smell of dog breath, our puppy,  Dumpling , was feasting on my face. Of course, I had no choice but to get up, looked at the clock and was surprised to see how early it was, 1:30 am. What the?! But I felt full of energy and was not about to lose valuable time sleeping again. Turned on the tube and surfed for a good show... nada. Turned on the pc and surfed for a good site... the usual. Mail, Friendster, Groups. Shut down. 3:30 am... would have turned on my PS2 but I just didn't feel like playing 007. Back to the tube, alas! Maximum Exposure! Something to entertain myself, they featured The World's Most Dumbest Guys. Haha! I finally went back to sleep again, last time I checked, it was 4:30, gawd, I have to wake up for work... this is becoming routine for me.

      Surely, I had fastfood for lunch... Japanese fastfood. The mixed veggies smelled kinda funky though. And for dessert, a box of heavenly Cadbury Mochacino! YUM! Discovered this last week and I can't seem to stop munching on these buggers!  I always thought things like these... these blogs were for selfcentric bastards. I mean, why would you think anyone will be interested in reading about you or what you're doing?! Well, its good to have a medium for your thoughts sometimes. I'm a selfcentric bastard.

      Been reading Dan Brown's  "Angels and Demons"  since Monday. It's an interesting book since it tries to unify the ideas of Science and Religion. And whenever religion is in question, count me in! Don't get me wrong, i believe in God, but the Church... it's a different story. I hate secrets. I was never a book reader since it just makes me sleepy... and sometimes, you just think sleeping is just a waste of your precious time. Hehehe! Of course, many would contest. To each his own like I always say.  Looking forward to seeing Mel Gibson's  The Passion of the Christ .

      I've been using Gmail since Monday and I must say, I'm liking it. The gigabyte of space isn't the only plus in this new  Google service , its features are also something to be interested in. Mail replies are considered as conversations and you never lose track of the past message. Its all there, which is a good thing for us with memories like that of a goldfish. Aside from the fact that it looks good. Simple but functional. Looks like I'll be using this service for a loooong time... until my space runs out (how the?!).

      Earlier, I don't know what came to me... I had ordered beer as my beverage for lunch. It seemed like the perfect time to have a nice, cold bottle of beer. Outside, it was scorching hot! You can feel the heat from the pavement almost raising you up in the air. Anyway, there we are, sitting on a stool, sipping our San Mig Strong Ice, it was better than Light but beer is beer. I'm not much of a drinker anyway. Now, I feel... well, sleepy. I dunno if its the alcohol or I'm just plain bored... maybe both.  I went to the nearest PS2 game store and got myself a copy of Forbidden Siren. A survival horror game set in Japan. I've been hearing some good reviews about this game and can't wait to play it later. Looks like I'll be putting off Wind Waker for a while... oh, let's say, about a day. Hehehehe! Gaming haven in my room right now.  It's a typical day here in the office. Bored and nothing to do. been planning on bringing my PS2 here but the commuting problems always bother me and thought it would be better to just leave it. Besides, I don't think I'll have the same experience playing in black and white. Oh well... I'm just bored... I wanna go home.

      I slept quite early last night... after watching Great Expectations on dvd. I remembered how I liked this movie when it first came out. I was in college then, I had lots of time to spare and often in the movies. My love for movies started when Star Wars: Special Edition was shown, back then, THX-certified cinemas were just starting and I was really blown away with the sounds. I felt like I was there, fighting the Sith, lightsabers buzzing left and right, Tie Fighters whizzing up and down. It was truly an experience for me. Star Wars quickly became my favorite and had my hands on merchandises, at least, the ones I can afford. After the trilogy, I became addicted with movies. Watching everything I can but with certain requirements, the cinema would have to be THX-certified... Dolby, SDDS, etc. Back to Great Expectations, I used to relate to this movie, Finn (Ethan Hawke) was an aspiring painter, with dreams of being successful to be considered "equal" with the woman he loved since his childhood, Estella (Gwyneth Paltrow). As an artist myself, I really felt I had to be a success... and having watched that, I felt inspired, I felt like even I can do it. Anyway, the movie had Robert DeNiro who will always be one of my favorite actors. Another thing I liked in the movie is the soundtrack. I actually bought a lot of OSTs and this one was my favorite. Sweet Sunshower by Chris Cornell and Wishful Thinking by Duncan Sheik were my favorite tracks. Sigh, memories of those lonely years.   "SWEET SUNSHOWER"  Dark as roses, and fine as sand I feel your healing in your sting again I hear you laughing and my soul is saved On forgotten graves you cry  Crawl like ivy up my spine Through my nerves and into my eyes Cuts like anguish Or recollections of better days gone by But it's alright When you're all in pain And you feel the rain come down Oh, it's alright When you find your way Then you see it disappear It's alright Through your garden's grey I know all your graces Someday will flower In the sweet sunshower In the sweet sunshower  Eyes like oceans so far away Feathered trails to a better way Worried mornings turn into days And into worried nights   ... beautiful! sniff! sniff!

      I'm still up! It's 3 AM... I had a nice chat with the people I'm going to work with. Seems like a jolly bunch... we consider ourselves pirates! Probably because we've been  "pirated"  from other companies! Hehehehe! I'm looking forward to doing this big project, if all goes well, we'll be sailing the  Seven Seas  in no time!

      I finally had the chance to play The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker on the GameCube (which I borrowed from Sherwin). I love it! Although sometimes, you get lost but that's part of the game. NFS: Underground is getting too difficult for my taste, but a quick race with a friend is always fun. Last night, Sherwin and I went to Chowking to get some refreshments. So there we are, eating our Halo-halos when all of a sudden, three of our friends from high school entered the store. Toby, Antonio and Darrel. I swear, Toby (we used to call him Puti, some even call him Casper, etc.) looked like JC! Hehehe! We had a little chat and went our separate ways knowing that things haven't changed a bit between us.  Guia has been getting a lot of aches and pains lately. Particularly her Stomach ache which we think is kabag. She's been burping and eherm... flatulating a lot. Hehehe!!! I hope she'll feel better already. I'm a bit worried about it. I'll be lending her some dvds later tonight. Peter Pan (a film I enjoyed, surprisingly!), Big Fish (a bit slow but enjoyable, so unlike the other Tim Burton films... this one had bright colors.) and Seabiscuit (I really loved this film, thanks to a documentary by Nat'l Geo). Hope she'll have time to watch these.

      I had my birthday yesterday... it was an almost ordinary day but not quite. I woke up at around 11am. It was a well-deserved sleep after having countless sleepless nights. I made sure that on this special day, I'll pamper myself with sleep. Ironically, the last hours of my sleep were quite horrible... the heat is slowly filling my room and found myself suffocating! I hate it when the temperature rises like that. But 'twas not just any other day, 'twas my birthday and I would not let myself be let down by something as petty as this. I asked my Mom where they'd like to eat and decided to have it at Pizza Hut. My treat, after all, it  IS  my birthday (did I mention it was my birthday?). So off we go to the best place in the world (insert sarcasm here...) Grand Central! It was a good meal, we each had spagetti, pizza, cinnamon sticks (which is starting to be my favorite) and strawberry soda. Gah! We're full! After that, we checked out the friendly Muslims and got myself 2 dvd movies,  Big Fish  and  Peter Pan .  The afternoon was a bit more ordinary, the usual hours in front of the television, playing NFS:Underground. Guia and I are sipposed to go out after work hours, but she was not feeling so good, we decided to just stay home and probably watch my dvds... but soon after 4:30, she tells me she's okay and would love to spend the rest of the day with me! Jolly good!!! So there we are, eating the best spicy chicken wings at Yellow Cab (the second is probably Greenwich's Wacky Wings). We enjoyed dinner and went on to buy myself a new fan! It would be nice though if I had a lot of moohla and bought an airconditioning unit instead. But well, I don't. Hehehe! Guia spent the night with me and enjoyed our time together. Sleep is good... birthday's good... not just an ordinary day this is... it's my birthday.

      Last night, I got my gift from Guia! And boy, was I surprised! It's a Wacom Graphire 3 pen tablet! The best gift ever! I was planning to buy one since December, I think. But since I can bring home the one from the office, I thought I'd just take it home whenever I need it. Now, I have my own and I love it! Hehehe! Thanks to my ever dearest Guia! How I wish I could give her everything that I promised her... well, after the new project is through, I may be able to! Tomorrow will be my birthday, I wonder what's in store for me... hmm... looks like I'll have to wait!

      I used to think our generation was one of the luckiest and I’m proud to be part of it. 10 years have passed and it has changed a bit… now, I think we are the luckiest. Think about it… we have witnessed the evolution of entertainment! Take for example, the video gaming. Today’s generation never saw the beginning of one of the biggest industries today. The  Atari . Our generation has seen Mario when he was just a few sprites and could do very little against King Koopa, or Pac-man when he was a mere yellow circle with a triangle sliced off. Now, these games can be downloaded and put into your phones… what?! Back then, we were stuck in front of the television, eyes burning with no, not passion or the desire to finish the game… but with tears… tears from looking at those bright colors too long! And being too close to the set because the controllers’ wires were too short! These days, children would laugh at the mere sight of these games. Games that are fun because of sheer game play! These days, it’s  “Ooh… look at the pretty graphics!”  Well, I can’t say I don’t enjoy today’s games. I do… but I find more appreciation in them than kids who has never seen what the past was like. For that, I am thankful.

      Lately, I've been busy with work and I haven't been able to post regularly or even if I do find myself the time, never put my heart to it. Tomorrow will be the start of a long holiday! Thank God! I was feeling a bit restless these past few days and nights. I try to sleep early but I always wake up in the middle of the night and hard as I try, can't bring myself back to sleep. Hopefully, the coming days will be fruitful for me. I've been putting off the last of my K.I.A. pages. It's been two months (Gah!) I think since I last worked on it. I promised Marco (Dimaano) I could give it earlier than the set deadline, now, I just feel embarassed for not being able to. But enough of that, this weekend, I'm sure I'll finish it and submit it on Monday. Gotta budget my time, Need for Speed: Underground sure is taking a lot of my sweet time! Hehehe!  Last night, I went to see Guia's new house! It was nice and spacious... and white! It's been just two days since the family moved in and the house needs some interior decorations. I'm sure they'll be busy on the coming holidays. Hehe! I wondered when I could afford to have my own house. Sigh... I feel like I've been working forever and getting old. Progress sure is taking its time. I need to get out of this company. Two months ago, I submitted my resignation letter. The Boss wasn't pleased. He started talking about caring for the company and how people seem to just leave whenever they please and not think about the consequences for the company. To be honest, I was hurt to hear that. Imagine being accused of being apathetic. I had the urge to tell him that the only thing that made me stay this long is that same "pakikisama" he was talking about. I mean, I love working with these people, they are my friends. But I don't enjoy the type of work I'm doing here anymore. After a while, you think about yourself and the future... and here, you don't have one. I'm glad to have worked in this company, I was able to establish myself and make a name in this industry. For that, I am thankful. I am now ready to move on.

      Last Saturday, we had a family reunion... the whole Rosero clan! I was surprised to see my cousins who all look older than I am! They're freakin' big! and get this... all in all, we are 76! Imagine that... you have 76 cousins! Well, they had a little show of talents, sort of a little Star Circle Quest. Without the judges, of course. Even more surprising is seeing some of my cousins who I thought was mahiyain, sing and dance in front of everyone! Will wonders never cease?! Good thing they didn't ask me to... ehem... perform. I knew I should've brought my CDs. hehehe!  After Splinter Cell, I am now a racer. Been playing Need For Speed: Underground non-stop. I was never a fan of racing games, it gets too repetitive and well, it bores me. I did play Midnight Club 2 but that's about it. NFS:U is different, It has varied gameplay. The drag events are particularly fun. I dunno if I could finish a game like this, I will try until it gets too old.

      I have seen The Passion of the Christ last night. It's actually quite good as a movie. The visuals are really good, the colors are undersaturated at the right moments. Nothing stands out in crowd scenes, etc. Sometimes, it makes you feel like you're watching one of those Christ movies being shown every Holy Week... but better and more believable! The scourging invoked some twitching and unified cursing in the audience. Hehehe! I do hope the director, Mel Gibson, won't continue his plans on doing religious themed movies. It may transform The Passion into something commercial, just another one of those movies... it should stay the way it is... something special and unique. Clearly one of the movies that made an impression in my heart. It makes you feel that whenever you're in pain, physical pain, it is nothing compared to what Jesus has gone through. Shame on you.

      I've been mostly depressed these past few days. I'm not sure why but it seems there's this hidden confusion inside me. With almost everything. Everyday, deciding gets really hard because lately, life has offered me two choices of everything. Even the littlest things, I get to choose... and choices, my friends, is something I hate. Things would be easier if people are confronted with just one option, nothing more. Wouldn't that be easy? Of course, I may just be weird not liking to have a second option with everything. In some cases, that's considered lucky! That's just me, I guess. That's one of the reasons why I got a celfon without optional covers, I'll just end up changing faces everyday! Haha!  I should not have bought this choker with a charm that supposedly DOUBLES your happiness. Hehehe!

      Recently, I joined an online art community on Deviant Art  urlLink  . I was quite surprised to see comments as soon as I uploaded my first picture on the site. Well, it seems I've found a haven for my art, I used to be part of GFXArtist.com, another online art community but I never uploaded a file since it just had to be linked to YOUR own site or somewhere else that hosts your files. I found it hard since I don't have my own site, hopefully, soon, I will. Hehe!

       urlLink     Plug it in .&nbsp; urlLink     I have always been a fan of Rivermaya since Bamboo left. Bamboo is a great singer but it always felt as if whenever he sings, it lacks that feeling of "Rock." Anyway, yesterday, while on a routine meeting with Sherwin at Megamall, we passed by Tower Records and luckily, I saw this,  Rivermaya's   It's Not Easy Being Green  album. I've been looking for this album since forever, I had the cassette and remember how much I enjoyed listening to this. I'm glad I found it.Almost there, just a few more Rivermaya albums and I've completed my collection.  Also yesterday, I started reading another of Dan Brown's novels. It's what made him famous, a truly controversial book --  The Da Vinci Code . Like Angels and Demons, it deals with secret Catholic sects and practices. I'm sure I'll enjoy reading this as much as A&D.

       urlLink    Azumi and the gang of assassins.&nbsp; urlLink     Earlier, I was able to find  Azumi , a Japanese Samurai film directed by Ryuhei Kitamura. I saw this first on  Wowow  and was impressed with it's camera work and of course, the cute Azumi, played by  Aya Ueto . It's a story of ten young would-be assassins, trained by a swordsman who intends to use them to change the politics of feudal Japan. But when they're ready for the mission, their Master asked them to slay each other until only five remain.  The copy I got was scratched and would not continue so I had it replaced. Unfortunately, they don't have any more so I'll be looking for it in Greenhills tomorrow. I got to have this film! It's a must!

      Last night, Guia and I had time to watch Troy and I must say, the Greeks have never been THIS cool! Yeah! I enjoyed the movie especially it's epic battles. Those were what wars used to be! Creative soldiers rather than just shoot-em-up with guns and RPGs. Hehehe! I dunno if the fighting style of Achilles was historically-correct but damn! It sure is cool how he swings the sword and shield around. Well, I'll be waiting for the DVD to come out.

      As I was surfing the net... I stumbled upon a certain headline that got me excited. Splinter Cell 3! Of course, it would take a long time to get released, hell,  Splinter Cell 2: Pandora Tomorrow,  hasn't even been released on the PS2! But it's great to hear that the franchise is here to stay! There are some available screenshots and I must say that it has definitely improved a lot! Well, the countdown begins for the long wait!

       urlLink    See that little black dot? That's me trying to put the CD in.&nbsp; urlLink     Ever since I failed to play  Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic  on the PC (due to hardware incompatibilities), I've been thinking of getting Microsoft's big black box. It's basically a PC that's meant purely for gaming, watching dvd movies, and playing MP3s. The only gripe I have with the box is their games. I know it's supposed to be THE major thing but what I have against it is really just minimal. Since it's an American product, unlike the PS2 who's roots are from Japan, most games are American produced! No offense, but most of their games are FPSs, which I don't really dig. There are exceptions though on FPSs. There are good games like Ninja Gaiden which kind of strengthened my yearning for the Xbox. Well, let's see if time will be able to answer the all-important question of the moment...  an airconditioning unit or an Xbox?!  ... rainy season's coming so that may make decisions easier...Hehehe!

       urlLink    "Immortality! Take it! It's yours!!!"&nbsp; urlLink    I found this line funny, probably due to how Brad Pitt delivered the line. It sounded like he's in a game show or something. Hehehe! Well, That's just me. Can't wait to see the movie. It looks good!

      Last night, Sherwin and I had a really long bus ride home. The driver were one of those who scours the bus stops and waits until Christmas before going. Well, it sure pissed off a lot of passengers, us included. I guess it's partly because most of the MMDAs'/Police were busy standing guard on the Poll precincts with the ongoing counting. Well, here's to a REALLY quick count.

      This morning, I woke up from a really weird dream. I saw myself (in the dream) peeing.  Of course, we all know what happens next. Yes, it felt warm and I had to wake myself from this bad dream or this'll really mess up my bed. Hehehe! Fortunately, it was not too late and I was able to stop it just in time. Whew! Well, hope that doesn't happen again.  Embarassing.

      This is what I've been up to the past few days. Designing characters and doing artworks for an upcoming manga called  No Man's Land . It's about a gunman for hire in the Old West. This will be exciting!    This is NO MAN battling one of the demons with his derringer and Buntline Special. Looking at the picture, what damage can he possibly do to this massive demon?! Well, that's for you to find out.

      It's election time once again in this seemingly hopeless country we are in. Personally, I never liked the incumbent president because of her attitude and her lack of honor. She once said she's not going to run, probably to escape rumors regarding her projects. Anyway, with the current situation the counting is in, I would rather have her win than the actor. I was quite surprised to learn that he was running for the country's highest position. I used to respect this guy and now, I think of him as just another one of those trying hard to be saviours of this country. Well, I doubt that the one I voted for would win, I was hoping he'd whip some discipline into the people. Anyway, politics is just good for show. Last Sunday, the  Borlongan  family had an outing. Bringing the kids to a pool sure was fun for them. I'm sure they had fun. But the thing that stopped all activities that day was Manny Pacquiao's fight with Marquez, a Mexican. The first round was great, the Mexican going down three times! Imagine, Three times! But after that, everything was ho-hum. My dad even fell asleep, and at some point, I did too. Well, the decision was disappointing, a draw. Well, that's politics in sports for you. Well, I like this new look for the blogs. It looks more Xp than the previous one. Easier on the eyes. Good!

      I have always been a fan of Capcom's  Onimusha  series. Excellent graphics and non-stop action always kept me holding the pad for hours. And now that the series has come to an end with Onimusha 3: Demon Siege, I was glad in a way that it was an appropriate ending for the series. It has by far the best opening sequence by Capcom... although it was not as movie-like as with Onimusha 2's, it was epic and will keep you watching with your mouth gaping open. It stars Takeshi Kaneshiro as  Samanosuke Akechi  and Jean Reno as  Jacques Blanc . At first, the idea of seeing Samanosuke, a Samurai from Feudal Japan, walking the streets of Paris didn't sit too well for me. But having played it, made it feel natural. But it did at some point looked like you're playing Resident Evil (especially when you are in the sewers). Overall, it was satisfying. I loved it... while it lasted. I finished the game in 10 hours. My friends would simply laugh at my patience for games. I bought the game last Thursday and finished it Friday. Hehehe! Well, as long as I enjoy it, anything to finish the game.

      Right now, I don't feel so well. I'm supposed to do some rough work for a project of mine but it seems I am unable to right now. Probably another one of those times. I do hope I recover from this soon. it's been a hot day today, I arrived in the office at around 11:30 and it was sweltering hot outside. Sometimes, going in late has its disadvantages, the heat and well, salary deductions, of course. But hei, anything for some quality time with my bed.

      I am supposed to be sleeping right now but this heat is really getting on my nerves. What I need right now is a cold tumbler of coffee! Come tp think of it, that's what the residents of Kalookan need, a nearby branch of Starbucks (or whatever good coffee place, heck, I'll be happy with a Nescafe Cafe place! or even Mccafe!). Unfortunately, we dont have any. Why? Because the people who are responsible for bringing such places think that the people in this city can't afford to buy expensive coffee! You know what?! They're right! Hehehe! Well, there are some, but would they be enough to support the business? I don't think so. this city has been frustrating for me. Yesterday, I was gonna buy myself the best sketch pad I could ever find. BUt I only have P60 in my wallet. I have to withdraw from a nearby ATM. Okay, no biggie... but as I tried to insert my card on the first ATM I could see, the slit where you put the card was somehow blocked, by another card, I assume. Maybe someone put their driver's license in there... so I went to the next, it was unavailable. The other, Cannot dispense cash right now. I went up the mall, I see, to remember seeing a  Bancnet  ATM there. What luck! there was no line! I let out a sigh of relief... but alas! It was unable to dispense cash again!!!! F*ck! So there I was, in the bookstore, settling for a so-so sketch pad. And it was hot outside, that made me even more mad at this God forsaken city. I hope the next mayor would give us Starbucks. That's all I need... well, working ATMs wouldn't hurt either.

       urlLink     Vin Diesel Stars as Richard Riddick .&nbsp; urlLink    I watched  The Chronicles of Riddick  last Tuesday. To be honest, I wasn't entertaind at all. I was expecting more from this movie, okay, so I wasn't expecting deep storyline here but it was just... cold. While I was quite impressed by the idea of the Necromonger monoliths, the effects were just too computerized for me, COLD. You feel like you're watching a video game. The Final Fantasy movie was more realistic in terms of effects and that too, I didn't like. Anyway, the good thing here is it got me fascinated on  Pitch Black , Vin Diesel's character  Richard Riddick's  first adventure. And after watching it, I could say that I was more entertained with this than the sequel.  Feh!  Sequels. The only sequel better than the original film is still  The Godfather 2 . Hopefully, we could add Spiderman 2 with it. Anyway, Pitch Black had more interesting characters. They each have their own personalities, likable or not. Even Riddick. I just wish the moviehouse had a subtitle feature that you could turn on since you can't freakin' understand what Vin Diesel's saying!!!  ..."It's been a while since I smelled Beautiful..."   ?!  Anyway, that's it. I must get back to work... sigh... another weekend coming.

      I just finished pencilling 30 pages of my manga to be released in the States early next year. I've been waiting for my  Pentel  brush pens from Japan, it should be arriving anytime soon, tomorrow hopefully so I can start inking everything. This will be a busy week for me... the first pages are very important in the production, setting the mood and the image of the manga. It was supposed to be finished yesterday, but since the brushes aren't here yet, I had to delay a little. I do hope the delay is worth it after finishing these pages... only  120  more pages to go and we're set. Heh! I've been watching Old West themed movies lately, bought  Tombstone  on DVD and some  Clint Eastwood  films to inspire me. Also, whenever I have the time, I play  Red Dead Revolver  on the PS2 from Rockstar Games. I've been fascinated with the  Colt Revolver  ever since I started doing this. I'd like to own one someday, displayed in an ornate wooden case with golden bullets. That'd be the pride and joy of my collection, I bet. Well, off to the sunset for me...  Yee-Haw!

The screen is 16:9 ratio TFT LCD wide screen, able to display 16 million or so colors in 480 x 272 resolution.  Apparently, this handheld's processor is as fast as that on the PS2! And will be able to handle PS2-quality graphics! This will definitely give Nintendo's coming handheld, DS (Dual Screen) a run for its money!

      I haven't been updating my blog lately. I've been keeping myself busy with  No Man's Land , my manga. But I can't say that's ALL I'm doing. Of course, we can't work straight hours on just one thing. There's watching tv, playing games, going to the mall, watching a movie, a dvd, and my favorite, sleeping! Hopefully though, I could be fast enough to meet my June 15 deadline. Almost there... riiight.  I could say I'm pretty much satisfied with the T610 I have right now. It's small and decent looking. I can't say this is the phone that'll stay for long, after all, the  Sony Ericsson K700  is coming late this year so I'll probably get that one once it's released. Hehehe!  But the question is... what do I get first?! the  Sony PSP  (Playstation Portable) or the K700... Hmm... something to ponder. I'll have to meditate... I still have half a year to make up my mind. Heh!  "Sir, are you classified as human?" "Negative. I am a meat popsicle!"

       urlLink     The SE T610 Volcanic Red .&nbsp; urlLink     I just got a new phone yesterday, a Sony Ericsson T610. It's actually a lower model from my Smartphone in terms of features but lately, I haven't cared about what the phone CAN do but more on it's primary functions which is to call and send messages. NOw, let's review the phones I had over the years... 1:   Nokia 909  - after the rise and fall of the pagers (I used to have a Motorola MemoJazz, that small wonder), I finally convinced my parents to buy me a cellphone, my point was if I get kidnapped, the pager won't do any good. Hehehe! Apparently, that may have changed their minds.  2:   Nokia 5110  - now, I got mine for P10K. It was yellow and at that time, was considered small. The first time I had text messaging, Sherwin and I just texted until morning. Now, I think the 5110 is being given for free. Hehehe! Just kidding. 3:   Nokia 3310  - My first 3310, after a few weeks had to be fixed (Contact Service), so I went to Greenhills to have it fixed, only to learn that it can't. So the store offered to buy the unit from me... with the money I have, I settled for... 4:   Nokia 3210  - yes, a downgrade. Then I came back to... 5:   Nokia 3310  6:   Nokia 6210  - The best phone I had until number 9. 7:   Nokia 5510  - MP3s are cool but it's aesthetics were really blah! 8:   Nokia 8310  - It's cute. Plus, the song that came with the ad got us hooked. 9:   Sony Ericsson T68m  - my first colored phone and non-nokia unit. 10:  Nokia 3530  - Don't ask me. 11:  Nokia 3650  - Although it's bulky, its features were tops!  12:  Smart Amazing Phone   (aka HTC Tanager)-  For me, the most feature-packed phone for it's price. MP3s, MPGs, WMP, VGA  Camera, super-personalization, PC syncronization, Windows Mobile OS. You can even read E-books, compose Word documents, view powerpoint presentations, use excel,  and of course, play games. But why change? So much to do, so little time... 13:  Sony Ericsson T610  - Small and practical. Can do a mobile phone's primary functions well. And it looks darn good!  Whew!

      I just finished reading Dan Brown's  The Da Vinci Code . Although for me, the fiction, the story of Robert Langdon, was better in Angels and Demons, the truth you'll learn from this book is eye-opening indeed. The secrets of the Church has always fascinated me and these books only fueled that interest.  I've been quite busy with the manga I'm doing for an American book firm. Looks like my dreams will soon be realized. It's about time. Hehe!

      My mom and I went to the mall and was thinking of watching a movie. After eating great pasta at  Sbarro , we decided to watch   I,Robot   instead of  Imelda Marcos . And I'm glad we did since we enjoyed the movie! I, Robot wasn't bad, it actually reminded me of the atmosphere of  Minority Report , another movie I enjoyed, I even clapped my hands after the movie...&nbsp; and  A.I.  It was fun and there was a bit of mystery involved. Will Smith's part could've been played by another but&nbsp;he was okay... he wasn't too smug in this movie. Anyway, I'll be waitingfor this movie in DVD.&nbsp;  Speaking of DVDs, I passed by the nearest DVD shop and found a good variety of anime DVDs. Usually sold in sets, you'll find good series like Inu Yasha, KareKano, Gungrave, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, GTO, Wolf's Rain, etc. I was interested in buying GITS but thought better to wait until I get back from an outing we have planned this weekend. I haven't watched anime since I got into work. Which is weird since I worked at an anime magazine, I guess I got sick of it. It was too much for me.  Well, better get my things ready...

      Ever since I worked on the manga every night, I&nbsp;made it a point to watch&nbsp;Conan O'Brien's Late Night Show (Sometimes, Jay Leno) at ETC. I never had this much fun watching people talk! Hahahaha!!! The good thing about Conan's show is he makes fun of himself, aside from making other people look funny and stupid. Being Irish, tall, pale and scrawny. Anyway, it's fun. Call me shallow but when watching the news and you see the same things over and over again, it gets tired. Seeing Mr. Angelo Dela Cruz arrive home once is good enough, but to actually exploit it every hour, I mean, give the guy a break! Let him go on with his life!&nbsp;And giving him a hero's welcome is really overrated! The guy's no hero... it's the Filipino troops who are to be hailed as heroes. These people, whatever the government's decision's going to be, they'll accept it. Imagine, putting&nbsp;their lives at risk not for their own agenda, but for the good of the Iraqi people. Even with the present danger they're facing, they are willing to finish what they have started. No disrespect&nbsp;to Mr. Dela Cruz... but I really feel it was a bad move to pullout Filipino troops in Iraq. Now these Iraqi insurgents kidnap 6 others. The pullout gave them hope, these desperate sons of bitches. If I were the President, I'd send MORE troops! But I knoe it was not an easy decision. Well, I never liked Arroyo anyway. I feel that she wants to surpass Princess Diana as the most photographed woman in the world! Heh! Too much publicity. GMA 7 was caught red-handed, stealing ABS-CBN's footage on thearrival of Dela Cruz. Hahaha!!! I never liked GMA 7. For me, their shows are cheap! And their new reality-based show 30 Days feature stars that don't have careers anymore... well, let me tell you my observation: most of these participants are former GMA talents. Hehehe!!! Just means being part of their kapuso pool of stars have limited lifespan in this industry. Funny. Not that I like ABS, but it's better. Well, that's just me. To each his own.

      When eating out, usually on fastfood chains, people always ask you whether you want to upgrade your meal and stuff. Since when did ordering for a quick meal this complicated?! "Sir,would you like to upgrade your fries?... How about your drink? Would you like to add pie with your meal, sir? If you get a pie, we'll throw in a free newspaper! (?!)" Well, life now, is full of upgrades, I just wish people could get upgraded as easy as that.  Speaking of upgrades... Well, after promising myself not to buy a new tv set, I still did. I gave my parents my old 21" JVC set and got a huge 25" Sony Vega! And I couldn't be happier with my entertainment setup, right now... well, a good Home Theater in a Box sure&nbsp;won't hurt. But right now, I'm pretty much satisfied with everything. Heh! Truth is... I'm a bit of an obssessive-compulsive guy and what drove me to buy a Sony is the sight of having just one brand of appliances. I have a Sony DVD player and a Sony PS2... Hehehe! Crazy!  One thing these things can't do is feed me... I'm starving! I&nbsp;gotta get something to eat so I'll end this blog.

      Last Wednesday, I had the urge to buy a new CD, I've been meaning to get  KEANE 's  "Hopes and Fears".  But when I came to the record bar, I was faced with two albums that I really want to have. One was Keane's and the other,  Franz Ferdinand 's. After a couple of minutes, I finally decided, I got Keane. And I really loved this album! The sound is like water, flowing and soothing. But Franz Ferdinand's  "Take Me Out"  has been playing in my head... so the next morning, I got it anyway. And I've never been  happier !&nbsp; Heh!  Last night, I worked my&nbsp;ass off doing manga pages. And here I am, still awake. At this rate, I just mightturn into a vampire. Always awake at night and sleeping in the mornings. Anyway, every sacrifice has it's rewards. Why not work during the day, you ask? Well, it's hot, that's probably the only reason why I don't usually work during the day.  &nbsp; "Sir, are you classified as human?"  "Negative. I am a meat popsicle!"

      It's been a while since my last post here, I've kept myself busy with my current work. It's been hectic but it'll be more than worth it. I am now on page 37... out of 150. I'm given 4 months to do this. I know I can do it, especially with the agreed compensation from my American bosses. I hope I don't disappoint. Right now, it's looking fine. I wish I could make it look better, we are never satisfied with what we see anyway. I could say that with this, I can now call myself an accomplished man. If you think about it, this IS the life for me. As a   manga-ka  .  Never sleeping at night, when morning comes, that's when I get to visit dreamland. Ahh... never seeing the morning sun... I always wake up at around 11am to 2pm. I would've wanted to sleep more but the heat is just intolerable when you're sleeping in the afternoons. No matter, just a little more and we could have all the comfort we need. sigh... can't wait to see this project out in the market. I don't know if it'll come out here in the Philippines though... maybe. Hopefully.  I haven't had the time to watch  Kill Bill Volume 2 .Soon, I hope. I hear it's better than the first. Although I can't say that the first movie was perfect, it was entertaining. By the way, speaking of samurai stuff, I got to watch The New  Zatoichi  on DVD. I saw the older version of this one, it's about a wandering blind masseur. He's an excellent swordsman, concealing his blade in his cane. Although the older Zatoichi had a really lovable main character, the new one has his charms also. They are both old and a bit pudgy. But like everything, it's not in the size but the performance. Heh! The new Zatoichi is much more skilled though. Probably because of the effects put in. Anyway, It's some sort of a musical too. But not the Moulin Rouge type. It's subtle. If ever you catch it on DVD, watch it! It may entertain you, but be warned, like most Japanese movies(with the exception of Azumi), the pacing is slow. Now, I'm waiting for  Casshan .  "Sir, are you classified as human?" "Negative. I am a meat popsicle!"

       urlLink     One of the best sequels! &nbsp; urlLink     Even with our hectic schedules... we're never too busy to watch Spiderman 2! And I must say, it's PERFECT! It's been a long time since I enjoyed watching a movie, and I was just awed by what the new spidey movie had to offer. Visually, it was perfect! You really feel for Peter Parker and watching Spiderman swinging from building to building was indeed exhilirating! This is by far the best translation from a comic book to live-action movie! Yes, better than X-men and that crappy Hulk flick! Everyone gave good performances, I was a bit tired of seeing Kirsten Dunst but after seeing this, I am in-love with her looks again. Heh!She was really the heart of the movie. Alfred Molina plays Doc Ock, a perfect casting move! And the decision to scrap his original comic duds was brilliant! Imagine a live-action Doc Ock wearing Green and Yellow tights! Scary! The movie has it's funny moments. A lot, actually. I caught myself smiling even after minutes from the funny part. Hehe! Anyway, I really enjoyed this one and will watch it again with the family on Sunday! Can't wait! Now, I'm back home and off to the drawing table for me.

      We watched Catwoman earlier... I was expecting more from this movie but it just plain sucked! The backstory was good, having Catwomen across history but I guess the team that did this movie just aint up for the task. The CGs look exactly like that... CG! And the story... well, it's stupid! The movie just wanted to show Halle Berry's body, I think. And you don't get a lot since most of her scenes as Catwoman are done in CG! Anyway, that's just my opinion... go watch it if you like. I took a break from manga work earlier to pay for my celphone bills and just walk around the mall. The usual places, Cyberzone and Appliance stores... looking at the next target. Damn, I fell in love with a tv again... I know, I just bought a new one but this... this beauty is really something! A Philips Flat HDTV! The pictures are crystal clear and well... if you buy it, you're wallet and bank account will surely be cleared of any traces of MONEY! Damn! Well, dreaming is always free...

      It's been a while since my last post. I've been to Subic with Guia and her friends. It was fun, the water's great, the scenery... too bad  I don't have my camera. But I'm sure we'll go back.  "Sir, are you classified as human?" "Negative. I am a meat popsicle!"
