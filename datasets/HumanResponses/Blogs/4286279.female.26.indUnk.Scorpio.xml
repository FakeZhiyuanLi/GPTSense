      i think that's german for 'tuesday'. all i learnt from my trip to munich earlier this year was 'breakfast' and to name all the days of the week in german. think i forgot 10% of that already.  haven't heard from both the metal and bank job. think i might have lost it. never mind, i just sent in my application for oil trader job. heard there's good money to be made, but i'll be stuck in singapore and heard it don't need much brains too.. whatever lah!  amos offered to take my passport picture so that i can send out my resume. he's so sweet! he even managed to make my face look more like a face and less of the background! ha ha...  it's another boring weekday, think i've got enough of 'doing nothing' and am raring to grab a good job and work 14-hour days!  pierre wanted to google me and find my blog... scary! the fun thing about having a blog is to publish your thoughts and opinions about people and happenings around you. don't think i'll have many friends or lovers left if they read about what I REALLY think... let's try to keep my blog to myself and all the strangers...

      yes it is! and sunday was a killer too! went to sentosa yesterday with my old friends (plus an ex, not derrick, but don) to catch some sun and play frisbee. the weather was so warm i was perspiring like mad just lying on my mat. i was watching this older woman with huge tits. she is a little plump, but most ang mos will describe her as 'voluptuous'. she had a nice thong bikini and was sunbathing with her top undone.  apart from her, there was really nothing else worth watching. the usual boys running about with a jack russell, there was a lesbian couple just two metres to my right.  after a quick shower at don's place, we went for karaoke. i am not a good singer, but i guess i am not tone deaf too. but two days of karaoke is quite enough..... anyway, i did my current favourite song 'crying' and left. i was to meet pierre at da paolo at 1930hrs.  i reached home at 1930hrs on the dot, pierre was in a cab just ahead of me. he came to my place with me for me to quickly change in a new set of clothes (i wore a translucent white linen dress with long sleeves from 'project shop') and to put his dvds which he lent me in a paper bag for him. we then went to da paolo (just downstairs my place) and he had a pasta and i had tiramisu. it was a breezy evening and conversation flowed easily. we haven't met up in a week and i think he missed me. he was supposed to go home right after dinner and since it was early, i wanted to go 'borders' to grab a book. but i guess we enjoyed each other's company, so we decided to grab a drink at alley bar instead.  pierre is a very nice guy. he is quite straight and 'follow the book' kinda guy, which is why we will never get along! i'm more spontaneous, though i am very controlled when i want to be. since i told pierre that we can never be together, he has kept his distance. but i guess after some alcohol and after seeing that we enjoyed each other's company so much, things can get quite physical. i guess i just miss having another person to hug and kiss. i am totally capable of separating love and lust, which is not common in little singapore. anyway, we did not continue into the bedroom, because i know that it will only lead him on and he will not be able to resist developing feelings for me. so we both went home to our respective beds.  i do wonder how i evolved to be so 'like a man'. i've always been a committment phobe. i've rejected a couple of marriage proposals and always steered clear of all the committment talk. but i've never thought that i can be so capable of knowing when it is love and when i just want some action. most women i know (from different countries and cultures) seem to want to be in love, get married and build a 'happily ever after'. but i do wonder if there is just one of 'the one'? we build this mental image of 'the one' and believe so much that he is 'out there', but what if he doesn't look/behave the way you think it should be and is in fact, just in front of your face? or what if someone up there didn't do his math very well and messed up with the quota? whatever it may be, i just don't think that the one i love will be the one who wants to spend his life with me. i don't think i'll ever get married because it takes a lot of trust, faith and courage for people to ever say 'i do' to years and years of sleeping with the same person, waking up with the same person, knowing that you'll love him for the rest of your life, knowing he'll love you for the rest of his life, trusting that you are satisfied with each other and there is no other in each other's heart, mind and bed. damn! it's so scary!  so yes, i'm scared. there are two things that i am truly afraid of - marriage and fish.  anyway, going to head for pool now. josephine wants to talk to me. i'm gonna have to hear her complaints... gonna tell her to shut her crap and that we all have dissatisfactions with life, and don't need to hear others' crap.

      yup, today is saturday, so it is the day for flipping the papers for jobs, gym, followed by drinks after drinks to pile on the calories! come on! who am i kidding? i drink everyday! so i figured that being in sales will be my grand excuse! (cos i have to drink with clients and impress them enough with my resilience and still be able to deliver my sales pitch and close the deal! ha!)  went out with my favourite ex boyfriend last night. his girlfriend was at zouk and roman is still away, so derrick and i just have to hang out with each other in 'comfortable silence'. nah, it's not that bad, we do enjoy each other's company cos we both possess no patience for making new friends who just want to know how we met. ok, for the record, i met derrick when i was 19 and we were studying in Thames for private 'A' levels, however, we were both rebellious and it doesn't help that the teachers are as interesting as ikea boxes (looks normal enough on the outside, some might even find it interesting-looking, but they are empty inside with fun factor set at nil). so we went to school, hung out after school and frequented the beaches in singapore (east coast, sentosa, ubin), and soon dropped out of the course because neither one of us thought that we will get a pass in chinese anyway, so quit wasting time. we then dated for four years and started 'pool' together, and broke up. it was a dramatic break up. there was fighting, cursing, stalking, endless drinking, casual sex, anger, hurt, pain, and of course, all the 'what ifs' and 'actuallys'. so after a year of breaking up, he found a nice girlfriend and that was that. we became friends.  my relationships with most of my exes have always been good. i believe in 'forgive and forget' (it's easier that i'm always the one who initiates the break up), and i don't think that just because you don't get along as a couple means that you have to sever all ties with the ones you loved. of course there always are exceptions, there is an ex boyfriend who is totally stupid. my friends call him 'luo han' (not because of his likeness, but because of the nature of his business). anyway, he was sweet, not too bad-looking, but quite short (take it anyway you like), and a dumb bastard. i will talk about him another day, but what i meant to say was, there are exceptional cases when keeping them as friends just seems like wasting a memory entry on your sim card. but in general, most of my current beaus (be it boyfriends or fuck buddy) find my relationship with my exes rather threatening. but i don't give a damn about boys.  so it was a boring night at plasma with derrick and the usual bunch of aging, lonely men. i've been through the entire song list at plasma for the 157th time, so i was REALLY bored shitless. luckily there's always ready cigarettes and vodka for company, and after enough of both, i can actually start being amused by the aging, lonely and uncharismatic men.  we decided to leave plasma earlier than usual, so we walked to le meridian for some nice thai food. derrick had beef noodles and i had tom yam soup (thanks to my carbo-free diet). eric joined us and i introduced them. typical of singaporean men, what do they talk about when they are unsure of conversation? that's right, national service. so they were both tankees... blah blah blah...  derrick went home soon after and eric and i decided to head for cineleisure for 'the bourne supremacy'. movie's not bad, but it feels a bit like discovery-channel-meets-amazing-race. go catch it, it's not bad. i just felt bad that my russian is still so lousy that i don't understand the russian dialogue, except for 'kozoel' - which means 'goat' but you mean it in a mean way, and 'da' which means 'yes'. so when i got home at 0400hrs, i started practising my russian. kozoel!

      and so the i am slowly catching up with the world. been noticing the whole thingy about blogging and thinking that it is a really interesting phenomenon! why on earth do people want the world into their little worlds? guess i just have to jump onto the bandwagon to find out - at 26 years of age!  what to say about me? i'm from little singapore, where the people are really little here. of course, there are always tall people everywhere, it's just that the majority of the population is really - little. i'm standing slightly less than 158cm, which makes me unqualified to even think of being a Singapore Girl, but i have to admit that the whole 'what a great way to fly' campaign is lost on me. why would i wanna have a 'bimbotic' job where my daily concerns are 'where am i going next?' and 'when can i get my next Louis Vuitton handbag?' (and they'll pronounce it 'Lew-wisssss Vee-torn') when my IQ measures the same as my height in cm??!  so guess i'm a little sardonic. and cynical. and skeptical. but hey~ all sorts of people make up this world!   been not working for 5 weeks now, not gonna use the word 'jobless' cos i do have job offers, but like my search for men/women (yes, that's something new about me you don't know yet.), my search is getting more specific as the years go by. now i want career prospects, money, good designation, travel opportunities, etc. in the past, it's always been just money! which is the reason i'm in sales for the past 9 years...   and the search for a 'partner' - i'm more into men nowadays, but not for long. used to be just 'someone to love me', but now the key words include 'intelligent', 'charismatic', 'tall', 'politically-inclined' and especially, 'hairy'. i've always got this thing for hairy men. i love a good stubble, hairy chest, legs.... and i love wrinkles near the eyes, i think it adds character to where there's none, good packaging sells too, as do sex.
