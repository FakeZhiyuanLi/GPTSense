      dear diary  sometimes i yearn to see his face..just one tiny little peek or even a glimpse would do.. sometimes i wish that i nvr met him before..never have known of his existance.. if i nvr met him..nvr fall in love with him..will my heart hurt the way it is hurting now?? will i live happily and not miserably?? will i look into something that reflects my face and remind me of my unattractive looks and unsightly manners? the reflections just deal me with blows again and again..screaming in my face that i am not worthy to even love him.. but sometimes i think..cant i even have this tiny tiny right? the right to love him.. it doesnt matter if he doesnt know of my feelings for him.. i just want to love him.. even when he is all grown up and married with 2 kids i think my heart will continue loving him.. my love for him has already lasted for 5 years..whats another 5 more..*苦笑* i use to think that my love for him was just a little silly infactuation..something that would fade away in a few weeks..but why..why is god so cruel to me.. i tried..i really really tried to forget him..to forget the fact that i am willing to die for him.. but i cant..like dracula once said.."love never dies.." i use to have this little fantasy in my head..when i grow up and have the means to support myself..i hope to find him again and rape him..maybe make him drunk and have sex with him..because i want to get myself pregnant with his child..because i noe that i haven got the tiniest chance to have him love me back or be with him.. so i'll be contented to have his child.. at least when i finally have his child i will be less miserable..because i will have something that belongs to him..and hopefully my child will look like him and less like me..i dont want my child to hate me for giving him my ugly features..i hope my child will be very attractive.. then at least i will noe that in future when i die..my child will not lead my life..and walk in my footsteps... the pain and humiliation only people who have walked that road will noe.. at least he or she will be able to find someone who loves them and lead a happy life.. then i will die peacefully..glad that he doesnt know that i love him.. i just want to be known as his classmate in his heart..and not some ugly and ah bai girl who even dare to like him..  this is my dream..if god is kind plz fulfil my dream for me..i wont ask for his love i just want a simple life of me and his child living together..plz plz plz nvr let him noe that i love him..he is the first guy i truly loved..the first and the last..  even if no one else noes..i will still love him deeply in my heart..hopefully forever..  bye bye
