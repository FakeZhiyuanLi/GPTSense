      This time tomorrow, I will be on the beach!   I’m spending the New Brunswick Day long weekend with a big group of my best friends and I can’t wait! My L is coming this year, too, so it’ll be even better than ever just because he’s there. We’re taking tomorrow and Tuesday off so we don’t have to rush up or back, and I’ve made my lists of "must haves" to help ensure that I can do whatever my heart desires while we’re up there. Which, honestly, means having everything I need in order to do nothing for four days! It’s going to be great!   The weather is going to be sweet, too.&nbsp; 28 C or higher every day, with a very low POP.&nbsp; I'm going to slather myself in SPF 9000 and bake on the beach or boil in the water.&nbsp; I've got to remember to pick up a cheap pair of sunglasses that I can wear in the water without worrying about them...I love floating in the Bay, kicking my swim-sandal shod feet, and visiting with my friends.&nbsp; And our hosts, well, they're beyond compare!  As fun as they are, I still used to find them a little lonely. Not that I didn’t have lots of great company; there was always plenty of that. Unfortunately, after spending four days with my great friends, most of whom are couples, it seemed like everyone in the world was paired off except me. And if there was an odd number of singles (always girls), it seemed like I ended up with no one to talk to. And I’d end up lonely in a crowd of friends. So I’m looking forward to hanging out with L on the beach, swimming in the Bay of Chaleur, sleeping in the tent, having lots of bonfires, home-cooked meals and Dixie Lee, and watching the stars…

      After all of the glorious goodness that was paying off a chunk of my student loan and eliminating every other kind of debt I had, the federal government was kind enough to write and tell me that they want a big chunk of my tax refund back. They made a mistake. And they want to charge me interest on their mistake. Oh, what an unhappy camper am I!   So I’m going to wait to call them.&nbsp;At least&nbsp;until tomorrow, and possibly (probably)&nbsp;until after this weekend’s big camping trip. I know I’ll be a happy camper when I get home, and likely much more capable of choosing the right words when I get them on the phone…rather than using every expletive known to man to communicate my feelings to the little charmer on the other end of the line.  The good news is – I still feel good, great even, about paying off all that other debt. I mapped out a plan to pay off more and more of my loan over the next couple of years, so I’ll just use the first few months of that plan to pay off The Man.

         &nbsp;   I was walking home from work yesterday, trying to get another, better picture of that window box (no luck).&nbsp; Trying to be a little subtle -- because I think I'd be a little creeped out if I found someone taking pictures of my house, although I'd be flattered, in part, too -- I had the camera on as I walked up the block.&nbsp; I glanced down and saw this through the display and had to have it.&nbsp; I love the perspective and way the lines crisscross each other.

      Since I finished university five years ago, I’ve thought – off and on – about going back to school.&nbsp; Sometimes because I thought I was ready, and sometimes because the people around me thought I was.&nbsp; I’m a bit of a perfectionist, though, and would like to do really well if I took a course or two in addition to my regular workload. But I’m scared.&nbsp; I don't want to let myself down, and I don't want to prove anyone else wrong.&nbsp; I thought about ditching everything (job I hated, apartment I hated, love life that I hated) and moving to Newfoundland to do my Master’s last year, but I chickened out and decided to quit my job for the right reasons instead. School would have been a good reason to quit, but given that I hated the job with a passion that was making me sick, it wasn’t the best reason.  So now that I’m settled into a new job that I quite like, happy with my apartment and&nbsp;happier than I ever thought I would be&nbsp;in my love life...and making plans to clean up my student loans in a relatively quick fashion…I think I need to shake things up a little bit. I'm considering a course or two through the local College of Extended Learning is a possibility, although their new schedule is not available (online) yet.&nbsp; Not toward any program or degree, but just because I'm interested in the subject.&nbsp; Last year they offered creative writing (several different units), sign language and Spanish. Oddly enough (likely because of  Deafening ), I’ve been thinking again about learning a bit of ASL. I’ve wanted to at different points in my life, not because I have a particular need, but because I’m curious about language&nbsp;without sound. I was curious about it when I was a kid, too, although I wouldn’t have articulated it in that way. I just wanted to be sure that I could talk to anyone who wanted to talk to me. And, I guess, that’s still part of it.   I need to&nbsp;work my creative writing muscles again, too. I’ve neglected them for quite a while, and have barely been able to feel the urge to write. Sometimes I doubt my ability to even string a sentence together for any reason other than work. So that’s part of the reason I started this blog. I needed to get back into the habit of writing on a daily basis, find pleasure in it again, and&nbsp;somehow ground it in my life. This format works well, and worked well when I did it a few years ago, although I worry about seeming obnoxious. So I’m just going to write here and let things happen, and hope that whoever (if anyone) finds and reads it understands where I’m coming from.

            Walking home from work, I have a great view of this window box.&nbsp; I've wanted to take its picture for weeks, but I've either forgotten my camera or ended up with a drive home.&nbsp; Finally, Friday, I had my chance.&nbsp;   There's a little glare, so I may re-take it, but for now...it's&nbsp; perfect.

      Today hasn’t been especially productive, work-wise, but life-wise, I’ve made lots of progress. I hate money, but I finally faced the beast, made a plan and eliminated 25% of one of my (sizeable) student loans today. The remainder will – if I stick to plan – be wiped out between now and July 2007. Which sounds incredibly far away, but not as far away as November 2018. Had I not made a new plan, that’s when I would have been debt free according to the little charmers at my bank.  So, if I can stick with it, I won’t have any debt when July 2007 hits. I’ve done a fair job cleaning everything up during the past year or so and it feels really good. The new plan is pretty aggressive, but it will be such a relief to rid of this debt.&nbsp; Not to mention&nbsp;I’ll save more than $26K in interest and eleven years this way.  Yep. Sounds pretty good. Look out July 2007 – here I come!

           I'll post a picture of the actual gift once the shower is over.&nbsp; It's great, though! Just the right amount of practical and whimsical that I was looking for.&nbsp; Best of all?&nbsp;&nbsp;I know she'll love it.&nbsp;

      After I leave work (it’s already well past my usual departure time), I’m going to take a quick run downtown to look for a wedding shower gift. Actually, I’d like to find both a wedding shower and wedding gift (both for the same couple)…but I can’t decide what to give them. I absolutely do not want to give them clutter! But I can’t think of anything that’s really going to blow their minds either, though. The plastic pig salt and pepper set I saw last week aren’t really going to do the trick, and a number of their plans are still up in the air, so contributing to either hotel or grooming costs related to the wedding aren’t really feasible options either.

      I was wrong about not owning any of Carol Shields’ stories. I noticed a lonely copy of  Dressing Up for the Carnival  on my shelf last night that I picked up at a yard sale last year. Completely unread and forgotten about.   Anyway.   I read quite a bit more of  Deafening  (by Frances Itani) in the tub last night. It felt good to soak up the bubbles and the story while my laundry hung, drying, on the shower curtain rod overhead. Initially, I found the book very compelling and I had to try, so hard, not to flip the last page to find out who was left standing. Now I’m feeling a little "meh" about it…but feel like I owe it to the characters to keep reading.    Deafening  is about Grania, a young, deaf woman who grows up and falls in love near Belleville, Ontario in the early 1900s. The setting and characters are believable, and the details ring true. It’s hard to imagine a world without sound, but Itani takes you there. You're taken to a world that overflows with sound, too, World War I, and everything the men try not to hear. It’s a gripping book, kind of a combination of Sebastien Faulks’  Birdsong  and Jane Urquhart’s  The Underpainter …but not quite.   Tonight’s agenda includes more reading, maybe some knitting, and lots of time in front of a fan. It’s 29 C (with the humidity, etc,&nbsp; urlLink they  say it feels like 35 C. Thankfully, my apartment is in the basement…but I still have to walk home. It’s not far, but it’s  so  hot.   Ok. I’ll stop whining.

      After work last night, I picked up  The Collected Stories  of Carol Shields, and  A Complicated Kindness  by Miriam Toews.&nbsp; The great thing about the Shields is that I don't own any of her short stories, so buying the book now is both appropriate (i.e. in the sense that it's a year after her death, I loved her work, etcetc) and practical.&nbsp; I'm discovering something new through this book, even now.&nbsp; And, about the Toews, I'm just anxious to read it.&nbsp; I've read excerpts from the story of her father's life ( Swing Low ), and really responded to both the story and her writing.&nbsp; I've only read a few pages of this new book and I'm caught up in it already. &nbsp; Too bad I've been ignoring  Deafening  and  Anna Karenina .&nbsp; I'm supposed to be reading those, too.&nbsp; Oh, and  In the Name of the Rose  and &nbsp;Baudolino .&nbsp; Those last two are loaners and I've been delinquent.&nbsp; And yet I continue to buy... &nbsp; Honestly, I'm like a crow, flitting from shiny book to shiny book.

      I just found a  urlLink new Carol Shields story &nbsp;in the paper . I love her writing and am anxious to sit down and savour this new story. I wish she'd gone on living and writing forever. I need more stories like  The Republic of Love  and  Larry's Party .   Rather than erecting a monument to Carol Shields, her family hopes to place benches honouring Daisy Flett ( The Stone Diaries ) and Larry Weller ( Larry's Party ) in Victoria and Winnipeg. What a great idea! Let's hope the officials who are trying to stop them soon recognize the "perfectness" of these tributes. Daisy Flett, more than any other fictional character I've read  about, became real to me as I read about her life. After reading the book, it was hard to believe that she wasn't someone I knew in "real life".   Happy Monday!

        urlLink Hooray ! Kerrie, keeper of one of the knitting websites I read every day, had her little one!  . . .  Speaking of knitting, I'm still on the hunt for a great project. This time I want to do something for myself, and something more complex and exciting than a scarf, hat or mitts. My only sweater to date was for my niece and it took forever, with its never-ending cables, twists, checkerboard, etc etc. I'd like to do another, maybe one like it, in a pretty blue or green for myself. Definitely not aran though. It'll have to be something I can stand to look at for ages on end and want to keep working on.  I'm going to take some yarn along on our trip to Cape Breton this weekend. It'll just be for a few dishcloths, but I'll need something to keep my hands busy for the eight hour trip. Reading or sleeping seems a little antisocial (although the easiest way to make the time fly), and I'm bored with the latest fuzzy scarf I've got on the needles...so I'll take some brightly coloured (and maybe a little ugly) yarn along to see how many dishcloths I can work up between here and there, and there and here.  . . .  I'm feeling a lot better than I did on Wednesday. Not getting any more sleep, but feeling better. A few days away this weekend will do me good, I think.  . . .  If you need a smile today, read about  urlLink Miss Doxie  and her dachshunds. You'll feel better, I promise.

      Do you ever just want someone to bitch at? Feel like stomping your feet and maybe – just maybe – kicking something? Want to crawl under your desk and cry for a while? Or maybe into your bed at home? Do Norah Jones and Willie Nelson make you want to slit your wrists? Well, I’m having that kind of day. I slept poorly last night and came away with only three or four hours of ‘quality’ sleep…the hours before 4:00 am are a blur of tossing and turning, either wide awake or dreaming that I was. And now, twelve hours later, I really feel it. Tired. Exhausted. Pissy. I felt it around lunchtime, too, but blamed it on a late lunch. It lingered, though, and I just clued in that it’s probably PMS. Oh joy, oh bliss. Just in time for our weekend adventures in Cape Breton. I’m sure I’ll be charming to travel with…actually, I won’t be so bad. Travelling with me today would have been a treat, though.  . . .  In other, strange, business…For days I’ve been distracted at work. I’ll be typing away, trying to concentrate when I see something flash out of the corner of my eye. I assumed when the fan was blowing that it was the springy chicken I have on the corner of my desk moving in the breeze. But today I noticed it again and the fan is off. Anyway. I finally figured it out…my flying fingers are being reflected in a picture I keep on the corner, in front of Hank the Chicken.  . . .  I’m too tired to say anything sensible, so I’m going to head home. Happy, crappy Wednesday.

      After a weekend of hibernation, L and I set off to look after a couple of things on our own. In my case, that meant reading  Real Simple , watching  Life’s Birth Stories , doing a few dishes and scrubbing the kitchen floor. The kitchen floor came first or second in the list, actually, and was quite satisfying. Bucket in hand, bare knees on the cushion floor, I scrubbed that puppy from the corner by the fridge all the way to the hall (a project in and of itself, saved for another rainy day) and mopped it with fresh water.   One of my least favourite chores (mainly because the rest of my mess usually stops me from getting the job done), and the floor looked great.  After an hour or so, the floor in the kitchen seemed dry so I did a few dishes, puttered around a bit and decided to put the kitchen back together.   En route (the entire “route” is about five feet) to the living room to grab the chairs, I hydroplaned across the one little puddle that hadn't dried.  Crash!   Bang!     Motherf&)*er!!!    Down I went my body's interpretation of the splits. I scraped the heck out of my left knee and big toe knuckle. The shock and pain were intense.  For a minute or two I was sure my kneecap would burst through the skin. But it didn’t. And nothing was broken. I’m a little bruised and sore today, but not really any worse for wear.  What was most annoying about the whole thing is that it was my second accident in two days involving my left leg/foot. The first happened Saturday night when I absolutely drove my left foot into the wall at L’s. That time I was convinced that something was broken. After a bit of ice and time it was only tender, and by morning it was fine…but holy frig. What a weekend!   Let's hope that these left-footed accidents don't come in threes.  I can't imagine what awaits me tonight if they do...

           The weather was near perfect while we were away. Over thirty degrees all three days, rain only on Saturday night, and warm, warm water in la Baie that was virtually jellyfish free. We splashed and lounged everyday, and burned both our skins and a huge pile of wood on the beach on Sunday evening. It was great! As someone said when I got back – “a sunburn is the sign of a good trip”. As uncomfortable as it may have been the first night, I can’t disagree!  A switch was flipped on this trip. Unlike previous trips to the Acadian Peninsula when I found myself nervous to ask for  un sac de glacons  at the  depanneur  or  un gouter de poulet avec poitrine et un pepsi en cannette  at the Dixie Lee, I was calm. Serene, even. Happy to be able to exercise my “french muscles” and completely relaxed when people responded in either language.       Sunday was an especially great day. Sunday is always a "free" day when no one makes plans, we try to avoid going into town, people start drinking very early, and we spend as much time as possible in the water or on the beach, burning and enjoying each other’s company. After breakfast I wandered down to the beach on my own while it was still hazy and took lots of pictures of the shore.       Later in the day, we were greeted by several loud blasts from a passing boat’s horn. Then, suddenly, five or six boats joined it and pulled in quite close. The annual Blessing of the Fleet had taken place earlier in the day and the people aboard were out celebrating. It was a nice surprise for all of us to see the boats up (relatively) close. Our three year old friend was particularly excited! The actual Blessing of the Fleet is supposed to be spectacular, though, so I’ll have to make a point of heading into town some August 1st when we’re in the area.       The hardest part is – always – leaving. Even as we’re packing up we start thinking about next year. Only 358 days to go!
