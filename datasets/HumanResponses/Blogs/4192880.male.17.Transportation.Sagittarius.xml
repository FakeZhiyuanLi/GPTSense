						    Hmm, why ah? why suddenly so many people believe in god? Class mates from my poly... even the girl i adore also believe in god.. my cousin also? LOL.. Maybe in the future everyone will start visiting the church weekly.. and singapore will become a christian society... And all the temple and mosque will collaspe? lol joking joking.. i'm a buddhist mah! ti gong po bi!!! amithabha..mai hor lim pei sway tio eh sai liao! Erm.. maybe bah.. maybe christianity makes one love each other easily and openly.. that's why most of the christians i know have such positive attitude towards life, love and wadever. Well i think i should start having positive attitude also! because in lord buddha i believe in! Err..Went to see Alien Vs Predator today.. and all i wanted to say is.. IT Is Such A Disappointment! The story is 1 hr 30 mins SHORT.. damn the director.. just trying to use the movie's name to make $$ and dont care about the way how the movie is directed at all. The dialogue and script in the movie were mostly full of alien and predator language.. goes like this, Arghhh ahhhh argwacckkk!! (Alien) or Gwahhhhh gwacckakkk GWAahhh!! (Predator) .. Tamade Buei tahan.. can gwacck and awrgaacck until i almost fell asleep. And the lead actress is.. tamade pai kua lah! what halle berry look alike.. tamade.. if the real halle berry nvm lah! cb... find donno which keh leh fei come and act as hero. Ok back to my thoughts.. Arghh.. I feel like a total loser in love man.. and life.. i feel so ignored by the people whom i cared ... maybe me myself too ignore those who cared so much for me... arghh maybe i shouldn't care at all.. nor should anyone care for me at all.... I sometime live in a fantasy world.. dreaming myself being a hero to everybody.. having my arm and knee bandaged.. walking up to a high place to receive a hero medal.. infront of all those i know .. me sitting in a wheel chair.. and everybody smiling and clapping as i am crying and giving a speech LOL.. and the most frequent image of anyone is nemo! ahh nvm.. just some fantasy. Anyway.. I want to be myself! and I want someone who can brighten up my life.. i've already found her.. but has she found me yet? no? find another one again? Ah... shud i let nature take it's course? haha this is the most frequent self relieve sentence heard everytime anyone has a problem with love LOL.. ok gtg do something else.. i'll update tommorow.. or most probably other day! haha depends! byebye! life rox!

						   Why do i keep doubting ownself Just unabling me to be myself.. Is this reminicense or maybe some nonsense Making me feel so pure and decent The fark am i typing here Is it to mark out my own childish fear? No there's really no meaning to it By now i'm already at the end of my wits Suddenly the word love struck my mind The no.1 word that can make me cry The one i love is never the one i deserve The one i deserve is never the one i love Why this complexity? In this huge city It makes me feel anxiety. Wow in my life So many bright spots beyond the night But the only stars i see is above the sky So people do you understand my words? Or do i have to fix you to make your brain work? Maybe someday we will meet Where? There... I've to stop this how..? Nvm good bye for now

						    Lol.. Was thinking, Eugene Low Started/Created/Having a blog? must be a distress signal then.. ok let me define what a blog is. It's a self emotional advertisment where you can basically type anything you want, gush out your inner self and show others how fucked up, care free, cool or masturbative your life is.. honestly when i read other's blog i usually throw up a message in my brain, what the fuck? is that how you really feel or are u just showing others how sad or cool you are the day the moment the period of time where there are actually millions of others suffering and eating shit for a living...lol ok a little over the board the way i say there wahhaha ok now i just happen to have an imagination switch...what i am thinking now is what am i going to type the next word after this and the next sentence after i type "this" ok i read what i typed above i feel satisfied. ok time to let "who knows who" a little about me. I'm 17 this year, i'm short, 169cm, i'm light, 53kg, and i live in a 4 room flat together with my mum. I have good friends although i spend most of the time alone infront of this machine here.. i'm currently playing condition zero, doom3, gunbound. I've played games like metal gear solid, final fantasy 7&amp;8, suikoden 2, Splintercells, street fighter, hitman and metal slugs. The best game regardless of genre i have played so far is Tom Clancey's Splinter Cells : Pandorra Tommorow. Recently i became more into anime partly thanks to the influence of my friend name gary aiw shi da, he's a horse.    So far i've watched Gundam SEED with 50 episodes and i managed to finish watching all of them in 2 days lol fuck! i'm lifeless and full metal alchemist. Heh.. i'm not going to go into the detail regarding their story line .. I just watched finish another anime call Kimi ga nozumu eien, haha again i'm not going into details..(maybe in future) but it's a very touching and well ploted story.    Ok the past is past and i dont think i have the mood to bring up things now.. well today i went out with hany.. haha she's sweet and still the hany i use to know but just kinda beginning to learn how to communicate with her hurhur though i'm very bad in communicating with people.. don't know why stupid gene my parents give me :P lol fuck i think i'm typing without fullstop of comer lol but who cares you can breathe whenever u want if u are reading this ok hear comes the fullstop. Erm.. what i wanna say now is .. I think my life is damned screwed up man! (picture this in capital letter) although i am not the only one saying this in my heart or mind today, this moment, this time.. but well i guess no body is alone in saying the following : [life sucks...life just sucks, i should die now, why ? what if? why didn't i!] ahh fuck emotions..ok sorry for using the f word for the 3rd time.. i'm actually taking note of it lol.. erm i think i'll end my crap here.. thanks for reading.. bye muack
