      Its 3:30 am here and I am sitting at the computer wide awake.  In a few hours I will need to wake up and go out to the rest of the world.  I dred the thought of this.  I know that if I lie down my mind will continue to think these thoughts: Where is Greg Why didn't he call Does he still love me Is he lying to me Will we stay together Is Kayla sleeping Will I live through the next month Will I make it thouht school Can I ever be happy Can I ever get away Can I ever just be me Am I fat Can I write Should I call Matt I feel sick I feel bad that I never called JB back Will Wade actually remember to call I miss sitting on Wades floor and doing what we do sitting on Wades floor Should I die my hair back Why is my face freaking out I have so much to get done I should run I should stop caring about other people Do my friends still care about me I miss Oscar Where did that come from I hope no one wakes up I want to eat I am fat Life sucks I cant cut I shouldn't cut I want to cut I hate that I cant spell I think someones up

      This is the first song that I have writen. I believe that I did this very late Tue. night/Wed. morning. It is about Greg incase anyone couldn't figure that out. I am not really sure if I like it yet or not but it was what was on my mind.  When we first meet I was naive I couldn’t believe didn’t want to conceive people living just for today using girls and drugs to get away I went against advice and started falling for you I wouldn’t havehad I knew nothing’s in that empty head tin man heart made of lead  A teddy bear and to many tears you looked away for to many years you stole my heart time after time but now I’m takin my life makin it mine  Deceive me once but I’m all right lied about dreams lied about nights sixteenth birthday you started a fight to stoned to remember I pretend its alright back together and I’m dancing with you held me close my cold lips turned blue said you love me till we get old to this day don’t believe when I’m told said you always wanted me by your side just another time you lied  A teddy bear and to many tears you looked away for to many years you stole my heart time after time but now I’m takin my life makin it mine  Now here’s my big mistake gave it up now years to late for the first time I was really with you felt more than lips when I kissed you I truly though I had my man even in public you held my hand held me naked close in your bed told me you loved me but fucked her instead  A teddy bear and to many tears you looked away for to many years you stole my heart time after time but now I’m takin my life makin it mine I’m takin my life and makin it mine   To many times I’ve been lied to tried my hardest to despise you but I cant and the reason I’ve found you can’t hate what’s not around numb inside is all I can feel cus who you are isn’t real you’re a little boy not a man for the first time I understand nothings real between you and me a teddy bear and to many tears the only things you’ve given me

      Good ridance Good bye You choose to do this I don't know why You choose to lie Please tell me why What is more important Cus nothing was to me Now this is that way You choose it to be Don't say you weren't warned Don't say you didn't know You choose to lie But I have to go I have to be the bitch Cus I won't deal with your shit All say what you will I'll pretend its not a big deal That you were wrong But I'm all alone So play the victom Steal my heart and my role Cus you have to stay here You get to rote in this hole Good bye Good ridance I'm leaving one thought Don't lie to a friend Or don't get caught

      I've lost you And I continue to loose Over you die Over I cry I cut I bleed And cry no more I let go And loose you again Never to hug Never to love Never to kiss only miss You're dead 6 years 6 billion tears And with each one You go Pain like a ton Throw away In the trash My baby is gone My heart is thrashed You die Every time I forget I kill you

      This is a poem that I wrote on 12-01-03 while going through problems with my friends.  Drama Drama Drama Look what life's become Poofs and Hobbits and Squishys God this is so dumb Why can't life be happy Why can't we all have fun Why isn't my life normal What have I done All I want is boardom All I need is friends All I ever get is drama It's a train wreck that never ends I don't need more tears more games, more fears I don't need more drama I'm done

      I look at you What do I see Nothing but a more pathetic version of me We do some of the same shit One difference I'm not a dick I don't hit I don't through a hissy fit when people dont give in Where do I ever begin with how stupid you are Of all things to have her ride in your car This is my friend She's suposed to be yours to If I ever find out that you do that again Trust me good boy your life will end

      Yesterday I took Wade food and hung out over there. It was a good time and relativly internet free. I saw Greg for a bit. Then I babysat for a couple hours then went back over to Wades and watched the end of Rat Race and talked. Greg was still there and I made him pop my back. Then I came home to find no Julie so I tracked her down to Kayla's house and decided that it wan't far that my little cousin doesn't have a curfue and I do so I went over there. Kayla and I wresled. I did VC shots then around 4:00 I fell asleep. I woke around 3:00 and we went shoping. I then came home and made plans with Celest to disk golf Monday at 4:30. I made  urlLink vegan cookies  for Kendra and went rollerblading but couldn't find Julie and Kayla. So I came home and took Kendra her cookies and strated talking to you all. The point: I give people food but if I gave them more and ate less I would be skiner and I could wear the cuter smaller jeans.
