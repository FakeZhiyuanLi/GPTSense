      So...  Pyro's Yard v2.0  The blog to go with the website. Also a kind of online training diary for me. I guess if other people can watch, I might have to keep training.  Recent events: Biking weekend in the Lakes/Dales. Biking day in Mabie and Dalbeattie. Weekend drinking in Leeds. (not training as such but a lot of biking got done as well.) Weekend sea kayaking and having fun in Leeds.  I'll post more when I can think logically...

      Future plans:  Adventure Racing - Hebridean Challenge, Rat Race, possibly Ace Race October, possibly Hellrunner, possibly XA 36 hour, possibly Endurancelife Coast-to-Coast.  Kayaking - Dee and Tyne Tours, November.  Running - possibly Harriers Ingleborough race  Working - Work at YHA Dentdale until September. Then work something out.  Money - get a pay cheque every month 'til September. Then start worrying.  Love & all that gubbins - Would be nice at some point, but no firm plans as yet.  Music - Keep playing and writing. Maybe try and get some gigs at some point.

      Well, this is supposed to be a diary so I'll talk like it is.  Life, eh?  Life at the moment consists of the following: cooking, cleaning, eating, sleeping (although not very much), training and worrying. There may also be the the odd spell of drinking and some kissing involved.  It's the training that's worrying me. I always used to just 'go out on my bike'. Now I 'train'. I don't consciously push myself harder when I ride/run/paddle, but I notice myself sometimes attacking that hill just a bit harder, sprinting faster for that ball, etc etc ad nauseaum..  Why? I have no personal motivation, however, I do have a big fear of letting the team down. Always have. that's why I pushed myself at rugby, at kayak polo, and why I love adventure racing: I get to do all the sports I love for recreation, and I get to push myself for other people's sakes.  Heb Challenge is going to be the longest race, both in duration and distance, that I have competed in. I'll be biking, running and kayaking. Running is the weakest of my disciplines, so I'm training a bit harder for that. However, I'm also putting in some hard bike loops every week - not having a car forces me to train. I like this.  We also have the Pen-y-Ghent race coming up - 5 mile fell race, so we'll see exactly what stage of training I'm up to before the Heb.  The kayaking worries me a bit. I'm fine in a kayak, but I'm used to whitewater, not big expanses of open sea. You can avoid rocks, you can't avoid waves...  Anyway. That's all forn the philosophy of the over-tired. I'll be back sometime.  Song lyric for today: "You can't stop me, I'm close enough to kiss the sky" Guano Apes - You Can't Stop Me

      Enforced rest is no fun at all.  I spend my time plotting to overthrow the world by wily cunning and bad humour. My time will come. As yet all I have managed is what idiot events I will participate in next.  What is yet to come reads like this:  26th Sept - Carsington Water Challenge Carsington, Derbyshire  2nd Oct - Ace Race Southern Scotland (venue tba)  9/10th Oct - Polaris Challenge Lake District (venue tba)  5-7th Nov - Tyne Tour,  Hexham, Northumberland  20-22nd Nov - Dee Tour  Llangollen, Wales  New Year's week - LUUCC Tour Scotland (various locations)  It'll all be fine. Only 2 weeks to wait for the X-rays to come back (shittim pissquick hospitals...) But I can see my ankle bone again, which is nice...

      So, fantastic racing at the Heb and Rat Race, a vaguely clear plan of what to do next and... a brief hiatus while I repair myself.  I'm a bit run down. Slight cold, pretty much to be expected after the amount of activity. But the worst is the sprained ankle. The story is too long to go through, but basically my foot wanted to go to Wonderland (down the rabbit hole, geddit?) and the rest of my body didn't. The 2 couldn't agree, which resulted in a twist, a fall, and a lot of pain.  The doctor thinks no significant damage to important things like ligaments, tendons etc, but the bone may have a small fracture, so I'm in for an X-ray on monday, crossing my fingers that it's nothing bad.  Psychologically, I feel fine about things. I'm obviously frustrated that it happened and that we were then slow. I also feel slightly guilty that I slowed my teammates down, leading to Kai's outburst when we missed the cutoff. But I also feel that we did as well as we possibly could in the circumstances.  I guess I put my foot in it...&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     So. Onwards and upwards. At least this gives another chance to recuperate everything else and do some training without the stress. And as the next race date is set, there's an aim.

      "Could do with spending some more time in a boat..."  These words, said in an e-mail to Nonie, Heb Challenge team captain, came whizzing back through my head when I'm sat in the middle of a kayak polo pitch at 4:15am on the Saturday of a bank holiday weekend.  The idea was simple: Raise money for cancer charities, break 2 world records and have a laugh at the same time. Question is, in 24 hours of polo, is it possible to do all 3?  My weekend started well when I managed to get out of work to get the early train to Leeds, then on to Doncaster. With Sleipnir once again loaded with kayaking kit, I set off biking from Doncaster station out to Hatfield Water Park, a converted gravel pit somewhere near the M1. Arriving 15 minutes before my first allocated playing slot, dumped my kit with my mates, bundled through registration (confusing the girlon the computer by giving her my real name. I'd apparently been registered on the network simply as Pyro...) and dashed back to get 'gimped up' (if you've seen ChillCheater kayaking kit, you'll know what I mean.)  Launching onto the water, it seemed that all was well. I watched the 6pm start of the event from the subs area, accompanied by hooter, flares and the pop of flash bulbs. Come 6:15 I was itching to get into the game, and nearly hoarse from shouting to my team mates.   I get onto the water and immediately end up straight out of my depth. there are 5 National Div.2 player on the pitch (including our goalie, putting me out of my normal position), so I stick in defence, getting stuck in and irritating the opposition as much as possible. A fast break from a sideline throw puts me right in the middle of their defensive zone.A miraclulous gap opens and our striker pops it to me for a very short shot. Goal #1 - the most I usually get in a season of normal (Yorkshire Div.2) play.  I sub off after an hour. Since a normal match is 15 minutes, the shoulders, stomach and back have had a bit of a working. I'm not rich enough to own a fibreglass polo boat so I'm stuck with my old 'plastic fantastic'. Head off to the DM 'Chillout' tent for tea and cake (and, as a bonus, Hoegaarden) and to watch whitewater DVD's.  Come 22:30 I'm back in soggy thermals and cag, getting ready for my second stint. Someone has very inconsiderately paddled off in my boat, so I have to go and steal a mates boat while she's asleep - first mistake. As I sub on I realise that the footrests are set way too short for me, and are bolted in place. "Oh well" I think "it'll be alright". Also the boat has no backband. Joyous.   urlLink    Polo at 10:30pm - that's me in the subs area...&nbsp; urlLink     Playing under floodlights makes a huge difference. The shadows effect your distance perception, making passing and shooting less accurate. The other team complain about playing into the lights. Just because they're losing. An old teammate starts trying to wind me up by deliberately fouling me. The ref (also an old teammate) starts winding me up by ignoring other people's fouls, but blowing up the minute I commit the slightest infraction (sounds bitter, but he was. He admitted it afterwards). Somehow I find myself on the break with a clear pitch and an open goal. A long range shot finds it's mark to double my total for the season.  I sub off after 45 minutes and have to be helped out of my boat - the short footrest and no backband has caused my lower back to seize solid. Fortunately some of the Leeds Uni girls are very good at massage (excellent in fact). I wolf some chilli down and head for my tent to get some kip. Unfortunately, that isn't going to happen - 2 other people are occupying my tent and my back is killing me. I spend a few hours lying awake and trying not to move. Eventually, I manage to doze off, at about 2:30am  At 3:15am Owen kicks me awake. We're both on for the 4:15am shift and we need to find breakfast first. Fortunately, we also find Gemma and her remarkable supply of painkillers. Ibuprofen and a fryup perks me up no end, and by 4am I feel almost human. I've also got my own boat back (you'd think one with my name printed across trhe back would be obvious as mine, wouldn't you?)  The floodlights are turned off as we paddle into the subs area, and I get the wonderful experience of watching sunrise from a boat (seen it while biking, now while boating. I love it). I sub on and stick with goalkeeping, just in case. There's 3 others from my old team on, so we work well together and keep pressing as hard as we can. Too often in the past we've all tried to play past our limits - aiming to pass too far, shooting too early, not looking where we're aiming, but somehow we all play like a dream. We look almost like we know what we're doing. I take my 3rd goal of the match with a long high shot past the captain of the Leeds Uni A Team - which I never made while at uni. I feel smug.  After another hour of play, I slope off. Supposedly my last playing shift over, I've got 1 goal in each session I played, and I'm back up to speed on my goalkeeping. The opposition keeper shakes my hand as I paddle past to leave the pitch. The atmosphere is so relaxed and friendly, yet highly competitive: Everyone wants their team to win, but it's a 24 hour game, so there's no point letting grudges and egos get in the way.  I wander back to the tents, get changed, pull myself into my sleeping bag, curl up next to a young lady and doze off.  At 9am, Revett knock on the tent door to wake me. He's got to take someone to A&E (broken hand from a nasty paddle foul) and wonders if I'd take his 10am shift. I think I have 1 set of dry thermals left so I agree. Kit up, collect my bib, get on the water and within a minute my number is called to sub on. I move onto the water with a grin on my face and the intention of 1 more goal in my mind. Somehow it comes 5 minutes later, after our other keeper is illegally kayak tackled. The break comes and 3 of us move up in formnation, sweeping through their defence like prunes through a short grandma, and a short range blast find the back of the net. I grin even more as I recognise the old York Uni keeper - my arch enemy in Div.2. I drop back to goal and play the worst 5 minutes of polo of my life, followed rapidly by the best half hour of polo of my life. For someone who's had about 2 hours sleep I feel great. I know it can't last, but this feeling of tiredness, serenity and absolute calm is wonderful, like the end of an epic bike ride.   I leave the pitch after 45 minutes. I'm holding the 'longest playing time' record, and as I pack up to go back to work, with another 6 hours still to go, my team are 20 points ahead...  Shame I missed the party, but I guess I have to work hard to be able to play hard...

      Picture this .....  The Polaroid 10k road race series is one of the annual events on the calendar. With the upcoming madness that is 70 Wild Miles a little short sharp pain seemed in order.  Spent most of yesterday with a good deal of anger bubbling ..... mainly work but suppose the other stress helped. Left the office with a guy I work with to drive down to Helensburgh - traffic was murder. We arrive with less than 10 minutes to the start. No time for using the changing facilities just a quick bare @rse in the car park and over to the start line. With a few races under the belt I decided to go for a personal best of just under 40mins. Things start well:  1km - 4:30 (about right) 2km - 3:35 (just about back on time) 3km - 4:05 (about 5 secs slow but still ok) 4km - 4:30 (what the ?!?!?!?!) - the stomach is giving it "pull up or I'll spew" feeling 5km- doesn't matter !  I was angry at the start line and my attitude didn't improve until the 8km mark where it was too late. Finished in about 41:30 which is about my usual for Helensburgh. Suppose if there is something to learn it must be that anger is a complete waste of good heart rate reserve and should be left at home when racing !  Got a lift back with my dentist and a couple of her pals. Got dropped just beside just round the corner from Spanish Joes (temporary abode), got a pizza and a couple of tins of cider and went back to casa de Coll with my tail firmly between my legs. Wolfed the food and drink and retired to bed. Ran into work this morning just to make sure the legs didn't think they had won!

      The whole weekend started with a phone call on friday morning. It was Laurent the Hairy Frenchman asking me if I could possibly pick his car up when I got into Leeds - another logistical nightmare, since i was transporting myself and all my paddling kit for the weekend by bike and train. More faff to be endured, I loaded Sleipnir up, packed my rucksack and set off on my wobbly way across Ingleborough Common to Settle to get on the train.  [much faffage later...]  Friday night was a long theory session. Despite being a competent land navigator, I had very little idea about tides, bouyage, Admiralty charts and the like, all of which are fairly essential for sea paddling. So a lot of coffee was consumed, charts dug out, books researched and I started to get the gist of it all. Enforced route planning from Duke of Edinburgh's award came back to mind, albeit with tide calculations instead of climbing stats, and no idea what the naval equivalent of Naismith's rule was. We planned a trip from Sandsend to Runswick Bay and back (east coast, near Whitby), nicely taking into account the change in tide, so it could be adequately demonstrated what paddling against the tide was like. Much planning and Post-It notes later, we went off to get a beer...  Saturday morning dawned with a thud, as it often does when you're sleeping on a sofa. Laurent arrived early as always, and we loaded the car up and headed off. It was nice to see Bertha, the rudderless yellow fibreglass supertanker, again, having not paddled her in 4 years I was a little nervous. And since the last time was on a lake in my first year of uni (fresher prank), getting used to a sea kayak hull took a little doing. Getting my fat bum in the cockpit also took some work (why can't they make them like my river boat?).  The world was a happy sunny place when we arrived at Sandsend and started kitting up. I was slightly fearing becoming a 'boil in the bag' Pyro as I pulled on my dry cag and trousers, but there was enough of a breeze to keep me cool, and a couple of practice rolls showed I could cool myself down if necessary. We set off north, taking bearings, noting transits and points of interest, stopping at lobster pots to check tidal drift and pondering what we'd do if that silly idiot up there fell off the cliff. Padllign along to Runswick bay was quite smooth, a little bit more exciting when Laurent decided to get me a practical demonstration of an overfall (not a very big one, but enough to scare me a little) and a nice smooth sideways landing at Runswick bay marked lunch time. Coffee, ham and taramosalata sandwiches and a Nutrigrain or 2, a bit of scrambling on the cliffs and then we set off back.   Getting back to Sandsend was fine, nice current with us all the way, blue skies and sun, and then came the obvious ending to the day - the obligatory 'rolls, rescues, bailing and sculling' session. I now know for certain that I can't hand roll a sea kayak. Close, but no cigar...  2 hours biking on the moors, fish and chips and a few light beers on Saturday night and a good amount of sleep (well, good for someone kipping on a sofa) and it was time to head for the sea caves at Flamborough. Myself, LynneW and the Hairy Frenchman pootled off in search of the York Uni boys. Bertha had been replaced with something a little more manueverable, but since I needed to paddle long boats it was a very 'old-skool' Prijon Hurricane. The boys hadn't checked the tides properly, so a bit of car-park faffing was done while we waited for there to be enough water to get through some of the shallower caves. we all paddled out in formation, looking out for the Guillemots, Puffins and Cormorants that inhabit the cliffs at Flamborough, mainly so the York boys didn't get their nice shiny river kit 'dirtied'. Some of the caves are really narrow, and I had a bit of a hairy moment when a freak wave caught me and I nearly ended up pinned across the tunnel. Who would have thought that stern rudder works upside down as well?   A lovely paddle out and round, in and out again lead us to a very nice place to sit and have our lunch and a bit of a cliff jump. Backflips all the way. And then it was time to paddle home, to get an ice cream, to try and unzip Laurent's drysuit as we pushed him in, and to organise a strangely successful impromptu barbeque back in Leeds. More beers, sleep and then back into work, a very tired, but now 4* qualified, paddler boy.

      We went up to stay in Lesley's caravan on Loch Sween (NR712791) for the weekend. Rob & Lesley were there too and we (Nonie and I) brought along Heather & George and Sanna (au pair from Sweden), so it was a packed caravan! It's a long and windy 4+ hours from Glen Isla over to Lochgilphead and beyond but we got there by 9pm or so (met Lesley in Lochgilphead and Rob arrived on the bus from Glasgow with stories of drug busts in Iverary). We were all set for a tough weekend's training camp with both the sea and hills on our doorstep.   Saturday   Rob and I paddled round from Castle Sween to Muileann Eiteag Bagh (NR715738) which is about 11km. As we went round the headland there were a few small wind-blown waves coming in from the south-west. Just enough to make it necessary to concentrate on steering and for poor old Rob to throw up :) (Sorry, Rob - I wasn't going to mention it... but). Arrived at the beach just in time to meet the rest (who'd had a 1km walk in from the road end). Had a great couple of hours playing in the sand and stuff. Except poor old Ben (the dog) needed a trip to the vets because of a problem with his eye so Lesley shot off to Lochgilphead.  Which meant I got to paddle back with Nonie in the other direction. Very warm and the sea now quite still. Beautiful, so I decided to put my head down and see how quickly I could do it. Nonie decided, wisely, to look around at the hills and stuff, but still only trailed me by a couple of minutes.  Back to the caravan with thoughts of a run somewhere. But we decided to settle for just talking about a run and started to prepare the barbecue instead. And then a quick surprise ride in a RHIB (Rigid Hulled Inflatable Boat, if you're interested) for Rob, Sanna, Heather, George and me over to Eilean Mor (NR666753). Really memorable: fast exciting ride on flat seas, warm sun, green-brown hills, and culture too! Eilean Mor is run by Historic Scotland and has a wee chapel and stuff on it.  Imagine Heather (6) & George (4) holding onto RHIB with the wind blowing their faces flat and their hair back - grins wide. Thanks for the ride, Mouse.  Later, barbecue into night with neighbouring caravans. Nice.   Sunday   More laid back. Down to the beach about 400m south of the caravan (overlooked by Castle Sween). Damming rivers. Paddling about in kayaks for Heather and Sanna (across to Danna Island) and round in circles for George. Rob had a good bash at rolling a sea kayak. Nearly got there but led astray by confusing and inaccurate advice from me. Do what I do, not what I say, Rob! Next time. Lesley rolled easily after a gap of 20 years (she must have be rolling  very  young, right?     Then, time to pack up. Everyone except me that is. I left them all to it while I disappeared into the hills for a short run. Very steep, very boggy, very heathery. That's my excuse for only averaging 5km/hour! Long drive back east.   A really, really good weekend. Not so much training as holidaying (which is no bad thing). Thanks a bunch Lesley (for the caravan) and both Lesley and Rob for being excellent hosts. Again?  (Photos soon, when I get round to it).

      This years race started at the hotel. Just under 130 folks met up on Saturday morning .... the usual mix of beardies, racing snakes, tubbies with some wimen thrown in to dilute the ugly. The first road section was mad - more like a 10k road race than anything. Clever German thought ..... "dinnae get caught up in the event, plenty time for the fast stuff". What I failed to take into account was how hard it would be to pass anyone in the forest section. Once on the open hill, it was easier to make up ground but the effort required was sore. Over the first steep ascent (they put us on a more direct line to the left of the tourist path) and the field was really spread out along the plateau section. Again, they put us on a more direct line towards the summit ridge. I was just starting up that last climb when the lead runner came past at a tremendous pace !    Reached the cairn at 1hr 2mins. Was trying to get there under the hour but just couldn't get the time back after the forest. The descent started well with hopes of under the 30mins. The summit ridge and first descent were fantastic fun. However by the time the plateau was under the heels, the legs were screaming ! Bad enough the quads being sore the day after ..... but during ???? At the end of the plateau, it was fast becoming as funny as the long score with cramp. The section towards the forest was torture ... not only the feeling in the legs and being unsure of the footing but also watching the sub-90mins target fade. By the time I was back in the forest it was more about keeping running than getting a time. Nearly spewed heading back along the road to finish in 1:37:45  The upside as I walked back to the car was seeing Lynne, she smiled said "well done" and handed me a whisky ! I spent the next 20 mins lying on a rock eating a snickers bar with ma whisky - intermittently dipping the feet in the loch. Other folks were having wee cool down runs and eating fruit. Lynne commented "is that not what you should be doin ?"  Next year target - Sub 90 mins !  Cheers The German

       The run …  Vale of Leven 10k is the last in the Polaroid road race series. Despite entering the series for the last three years, this was the first time I wasn’t double booked and could actually attend (actually I was double booked but that is another tale).  The start was down by the railway station before a loop led up into Balloch country park and a short hill which broke the field up a little. An easy descent back into town before heading out towards Jamestown, Bonhill, over the river Leven and a return to Balloch via Alexandria.  At the 5km point things were looking good for a new PB with 20 minutes and 29 seconds on the watch (previously I managed 40:37 at the faster Dumbarton course). Once again, no amount of effort seemed to pull back the 29 seconds to get under the magic 40 minute mark which would have been perfect – was the previous best at Dumbarton beaten … not sure. I stopped my watch at exactly 40:37 ! Will see the official results soon I suppose.  Quick yap to a lass I was at school with, then off north to the river Teith …   Maybe ma boat is too wee ?  I sent Rossco a txt to let him know I was just past Drymen (his burd was on cook duty). About 40 mins later I got a concerned call asking where I was … apparently the journey should of taken half the time and I had taken the tourist route ?!?!?  Conversation over lunch (which was cracking – cheers Lynn) centered around the New Zealand All Blacks and personal in-security. Fully fed, we fully loaded loaded the car and headed up to Eas Gobhain which flows into the Teith. An easy start and an easy float for a while. Passing the meadows we debated if the river was up or down on the last time. Before long, we were using hands to lift the bottom of the boat off the river bed. Shortly after we were out and walking over a section that was almost completely dry.  After the luxury and space of the sea kayak, the Riot 007 seemed ehhhh … tight. After the run the legs were sore but after an hour in the 007 I couldn’t even feel them. Ross suggested we pulled over and stretched the legs a little. My problem was standing up ! As I wiggled about trying to get onto the bank the blood returned which in retrospect may not of been a good thing. Back in the boat, cramp threatened for the remainder of the journey. Major memory of the trip was watching Rossco fall into the river whilst exiting the kayak at the get out.  It was great to be back on moving water again !!!

         Policy – if in doubt … do it.     Over the last seven days I have wondered if this should be posted. For me, it is open head and heart material. The memories and feelings associated with the days before and after 70 wild miles are pretty raw. Maybe what is below should remain in my head but I have a nagging fear of forgetting which kinda makes me go with how I feel at times …..    A difficult decision …  My Mum’s fight with lung cancer had been going on for 12 years. Over the past few months her condition had been getting worse. Gut instinct was to stay at home in Glasgow. Following a conversation with her and my Dad, gut instinct was overruled and I headed north towards Glen Coe.   Pre-race …  When it comes to accommodation in the Coe, the location of choice is to camp at the back of the Kingy. This is more for historical reasons (the Big Yin and I had a misspent youth based here) than anything more practical. Having said that, with and early start from the White Corries next morning, it made perfect sense. Kayak off loaded, tent up and it was time for food and a beer. Maybe a sign of age but I choose the lounge bar with the higher degree of comfort as opposed to the more usual climbers bar.  The alarm went off just after 6:30am and the stove sparked into life for morning coffee. Carbo loading continued with a bag of mini jaffa cakes complete with the “smashin wee orangy bit”.  Up at the White Corries bikes were being assembled, brakes tested, tyres checked …. i.e. much faffing about.  The paranoia about "was all the right gear in the right transition bag" and "was the right tranisition bag in the right van" soon disappeared – there was a serious 47 mile time trial to be done … too late for worrying !   The Bike …  47 miles is a long way. Across the Rannoch Moor, on a road bike and 47 miles is closer to madness.   In 1990 I remember crossing the moor on a suzi 600 bandit and feeling incredibly small and this felt worse! Still - heid doon / @rse up and arms onto the tri-bars. After the initial nerves settled down it was great. The 64kmph descent down towards Bridge of Orchy was “interesting” – easy time improvement to be had but at the risk of a bent bike and body in the event of a crash. It seemed like no time at all before the race marshals were warning of the right turn at Tyndrum. The road sign announced that there was 24 miles to Taynuilt and the finish – a check of the cycle computer showed that the sub 2 hour target was well possible. By the time the undulations in the road hit the legs, that target seemed …less possible. With Taynuilt in sight the same computer indicated that the target had been missed and a damage limitation exercise begun with everything possible getting thrown into the last mile or so up to the pier.  A split of 2:05:46 – just over target but the best that could have been achieved on the day.   The Kayak …  Thankfully Iain Burns joined the army and donated a sea kayak for beer and curry. I say thankfully because I really wouldn’t be up for a 10 mile paddle in the wee Riot 007 play boat thing I own.  The mass start was fantastic with boats of every shape, size and type. Watching the brave (and skilled) folks in the tippy marathon boats trying to stay upright helped to pass the time till all hell broke loose and we were off. Very quickly the field broke into those who knew what they were doing … and those who wondered what they were doing. I have heard of magnetic boulders in rivers but the north shore of Loch Etive ??? At one point I hadn’t put a right stroke in for about 10 minutes. All the effort was being put into the staying in a straight line – which meant left, left, left left, left … etc.  My shoulders and back were agony by the time the finish was in view. From a previous trip here I knew there was still a long way to go.  A split of 2:01:26 – again just over the target of under 2 hours (which could have been achieved if I had tried harder in the early part of the paddle ….. AAAARRRGGGHH)   The Run …  Having had a practice run over this section, the confidence of knowing where the three really nasty hills were, was tempered with heavy post bike / post paddle legs. My overall aim was to get under 6 hours for the total 70 wild miles. Fearful of attracting cramp and having to walk, a steady pace was adopted. With each mile marker that went by, the legs loosened off. The superb scenery was added to the bucketful of memories that continue to live in various parts of Glen Etive.  The only downside of the run, was having to jump clear of a minibus and into a ditch – the annoying thing was it was being driven by a race marshall who should know better !  Mile 11 … no point in finishing with anything left over so the pace was increased to everything that could possibly be sustained for the remainder of the distance.  A split of 1:36:10 – better than I could of ever have hoped for.   Post Race …  A quick set of goodbyes /congratulations, car loaded and the journey south started. Usually the race medals go to Mirren. This time I gave mine to my Mum.  About 10am on the Sunday morning, I got the phone call to tell me to get over to the house quickly – my Mum was worse. Early afternoon, an emergency doctor prepared to give a dose of diamorphine to make my Mum comfortable. The effect of this was explained and my dad, sister and I said everything that needed to be said. Overnight, my dad and I took turns overnight in checking on her. Around 6am on the Monday morning we were looking at her still fighting for breath .... and wondering how she was still managing to achieve it  ! I nipped out about 8:30am to take Mirren to school and just before 9am - my Mum died with my dad by her side.  Over the next few days some thoughts about 70 wild miles rattled around the head.   Was it the right decision to race ? For sure – life is about getting out there and trying. If you have your health and fitness it should be used whenever you have the chance … you never know when it might not be there.   Are results important ? Again, I think they are. Without targets to work toward how do you measure yourself ?  What is more important than results ? – your family and pals. Without these people to share it all with, the experience could be empty. My dad summed it up “the best bit about going out on the bike, or into the mountains … is coming home” Coming home has changed forever now.   I also thought about how I had come to take part in 70 wild miles. A quick trace revealed it came from taking up paddling. I had thought about it in previous years but dismissed it due to the kayak section. How did I take up paddling … by meeting Nonie at last years Hebridean Challenge which was due to Rob … which was due to taking part in SAS Jungle … etc …   Like I said … the most important thing about a race is having good folks around you.   On a lighter note …    During the cycle I saw a couple of folks with "in memory of Mum and Angela" signs on their backs. This broke me and in both cases I passed them in tears. Would of liked the opportunity to let them know "why" but also kinda like the idea of them thinking ...... "WOW - how hard is that guy trying that he is crying" !!!!!!!!!!!

      Let's begin at the beginning.  It's a nice sunny afternoon. I'm stood in a layby with my manager and his girlfriend, going through a bizarre series of stretches. Everyone else who posts to this blog is off doing crazy things in Glencoe. So what am I up to? Waiting...  We wait a bit more. Then Chris turns up in his Volvo. Then Matt, and all of a sudden there are 8 of us. We all do some more bizarre stretches and try and psyche each other out.  We walk over to the 'start line'. Someone says 'go'. We all run off.  This is the fifth running of the annual YHA (+ hangers on) Pen-y-Ghent race/fun run. I say fun run, as you're not supposed to race on a public path without police permission. It started as a 'lets go for a run sometime' comment from the manager of Stainforth YHA to some of his staff, then suffered under the effects of excess testosterone and became a race.5 year on and the hormones haven't worn off yet...  Pen-y-Ghent is a big hill. 694 metres, according to my map. There's a very steep path up one end. Guess which way we're going? Got it in one...  I've been spending a lot of time on my bike recently, hence I'm not such a great runner. Aiden, my manager, has been training for this. Chris, the manager at Stainforth, runs this about once a month. The others I've never met, so I don't know. As we set off, I go hard, keeping with Aiden and Simon. I think I can keep this pace up but I'm wrong. The gradient and surface changes make it hard to keep a rhythm going, and the fast start was the wrong idea: I've never run this race and it's been a long time since I did anything like it. So, I flag early on - after about a mile, I'm 30 yards back on Simon and Chris is about 30 yards behind me, but looking a lot fresher as we reach the first stiles. He passes me soon after.  The constant climb to the 'base' of the hill is a long drag, slight drops at times, but never enough to really relax and catch your breath. So, I chug along, keeping my own pace now, not aiming for the others: there is a chance I can reel some time back on the descent, as I know Aiden can't descend very quickly. But Chris and Simon can...  Ellie is 100 yards behind me, Matt 50 behind her, and I can't see Phil and Robin. I get to the steepest part of the climb (yes, those are crags on the map - yes, it is a 'climb', pretty much...) and pause briefly. The rough steps slow everyone except Chris down, and he goes up them like they're not there. By the top he's caught Aiden and is gunning for Simon.   I'm just aiming to get round, and hopefully stay ahead of Ellie, who seems to be gaining on me (must be her personal stereo). But I scramble over the last rocky step, look up, and see the trig point 100 metres away. I set off again, and there's no way anyone will catch me on the descent.  Pen-y-Ghent race route - 8.9km (5.56 miles), 464m climb.  urlLink     urlLink     As I top out, some other members of the YHA staff who walked up earlier are having a barbecue at the top. 'Well done!' says Alex. "If I'd know it was that steep, I'd have brought f'ing crampons" I reply. But it's mostly down from here. Over the stile and it's time to move. I look along the path briefly, and see Aiden a long way ahead of me. I'm not going to catch him, so I concentrate on going at a fast but safe pace. The descent is rocky and loose and at one point I see Aiden fall, but he gets up quickly, dusts himself down and he's off again.   The pain arrives at the gate into the lane - the last 1.5 miles is along a walled lane, not climbing, but not downhill enough for 'gravity assist'. so I drag along, trying not to hurt myself. At one point I glance back and see Phil about 500 yards back; he's made a lot of time up on the descent, passing Ellie and Matt. Robin's still nowhere to be seen.  I remember the advice I was given at the start 'turn left through the farm yard', and vault the gate, then trundle on to the bridge to finish. As I get there, the others congratulate me, and Chris tells me I've done 63 minutes, which quite cheers me up. I've come 4th, although I'm 7 minutes down on Aiden in 3rd. In a way I'm happy, as it tells me my running is better than I thought it was, but in a way I'm unhappy as I didn't run how I should have and lost time as a consequence. Oh well, I'll know for next time.  As the others finish we clap them in. Everyone who's raced has set a PB, which is quite nice. The hostel's closed this evening, so we can relax a bit. I neck some water, grab a CamelBak shower in the layby and then head to the pub for a nice pint of Landlord and a curry...

      70 Wild Miles   12th June the day when of us has been waiting for dawned with only a hint of rain in the sky.  I had a plan in my head for this race  but after a few months of interrupted training it was time to put it into action (the details of the interruptions are not for listing on a family site like this one but believe me many a tube of ointment was packed in all my transition bags).   Bike   I started the bike at just after 8.00 and it was nice to get the stress of preparing out of the way and just start cruising down the road. I spotted Dave (Outside Edge) just starting down the road a couple of minutes in front of me to give me something to aim for.  The first half of the bike was fantastic with big sweeping descents and even the climbs seemed like fun.    Then came that turn.  The course direction stated turn right at Tyndrum.  The other way of putting it would be 'at Tyndrum point your bike into the biggest wind you can find and slow down' Only 24 miles of head wind to get to the end of the bike.  I tried to stay focussed and down on the tri bars but still no sign of Dave.     All went smoothly for the next 20 miles or so and then my front wheel hit a massive pothole - I looked down expecting to see a flat tyre but it was still running - the wheel now with a very jaunty wiggle to it but was still going round.  Then a glimpse at the tyre showed it was very squint - I was running tubs instead of normal tyres.  Very quick and light but if they are on squint they tend to fall off the wheel.  The next 4 miles were spent with a slightly more cautious attitude going down hill and a bit of an aversion to standing on the pedals !!!   Then two miles to go there was Dave !! 40 miles to catch him but I did it.  I passed him on the last hill before the finish - he then passed me on the last down hill so he managed to finish first after all.    All in all happy with the bike and felt a bit fresher than I thought I was going to after being unable to push hard for the last few miles.   Kayak   A big mass start for all the boats and I quickly settled into my lack of rhythm.  It took me a long time to find any sort of pace or any sort of anything.  Eventually settled down a bit to find myself way over to the left of most people.  I could see what I thought was Lesley about the same pace but actually with other people so I knew my pace was OK.  With a bit of a cross wind I was struggling to relax and for me that just makes me go slower.    After what felt like 4 hours I had a quick look at my watch I found out I had bravely made it through the first 30 minutes of the paddle.  Relaxation was not helped by the boat nearest me managing half a roll (the down bit).   A long time later I rounded the headland and could make out the finish.  I was not a happy bunny as I dragged myself in after a couple of hours to finish but two legs done and one to go.  Run  12 / 13 miles of running fun.  Now I had been warned that this course was mostly uphill but this is incredible.  I am certain that a chain of yaks passed me near the end and I regretted the lack of supplementary oxygen at times.  I ran the first four or so miles with Lesley (more for my benefit than hers as I have a real habit of running too fast at the start).    Then on a nice big hill I decided it was time to run fast or I would never have time to get really knackered and mess up the end of the run and be forced to walk.  Thankfully I managed to get this right so by mile 10 I was reduced to walking breaks in between running and this was gradually replaced by running breaks in between walking.  The only highlight of this section was when I managed to pass people by walking quicker (sorry Kenny you might be able to do a 1hr 46 min bike but when it comes to shuffling I am just too quick).  So after a longer run than I had hoped 70 wild miles was over.  There are many other tales to tell from my day and others but I guess they will have to wait to be poured out over a few pints.  Great race, great day, great company, great weather, rotten last 4 miles.  Will I be back – I’d of thought so.

      Just back from Glen Coe and another frantic  urlLink 70 Wild Miles  race. Frantic mostly because of the amount of organisation involved.  A brief description of the race: road bike from White Corries (Glen Coe ski centre) south to Tyndrum and then west to Taynuilt (about 43 miles); kayak north up to the end of Loch Etive (10 miles); run up the road along Glen Etive (about 12.5 miles). You'll maybe notice that that doesn't add up to 70 miles but "65.5 Wild Miles" just doesn't sound as good.  There's lots of preparation involved: bike in working order, kayak that doesn't leak, paddles, kit bag at the end of the bike with kayak stuff in, kit bag at the end of the kayak with running stuff in, kit bag at the finish with warm stuff in. It sounds simple enough but it becomes more complicated when you try and do it. Not sure why. So it took us about a day to pack and we set off for Glen Coe in plenty of time. Then my car broke down :( I don't have the heart to relate all the details (and you probably don't care), but the consequence was that instead of arriving at 6pm the night before the race we arrived at 10.30pm having not had a proper meal. I hastily eat some pasta not quite sure whether carbo loading was wise or relevant at that late stage - but it tasted good. I got to sleep about 11.30pm and slept soundly until 5.55am whilst Nonie sleeplessly mulled over the logistics of the next day inbetween short spells of sleep.    Bike   Okay, so you get the picture. Lots of organisation, plans awry, lack of sleep. But the weather was good and I was at the start with all my gear and nothing holding me back so I was ready for anything. My start time was 8.00am but they are pretty laid back at the race and after a few delays I eventually set off at 8.25am. The roads were dry but there was a strong headwind (which isn't unusual). Eddie Ward set off about 30 seconds before me and I set my sights on overtaking him as soon as possible. Over the 30 minutes he slowly crept ahead and I eventually lost sight of him. Damn. He was in red and I kept catching people up thinking it was him only to be disappointed when I passed them. But I got to Tyndrum in a little under 55 minutes and I was hurting but feeling good. I eat a energy gel (which I'd cleverly taped to the bike frame so that it opened as I riopped it off - what a pro). I think it must be psychological because within about 5 seconds I felt ready to up the pace. The wind had cleverly shifted (or more likely, was funnelled by the hills) so that despite turning from south to west we still had a head wind. Grrr. And then, hooray, there was Eddie ahead of me. I accelerated so that I could pass him with the maximum degree of humilation and laughed at him as I passed - why is it so easy to be cruel to your good friends? I felt good now and was really pushing it. Passing lots of humans and being passed by the other proper cyclists. I didn't mind because I don't really feel in the same league as them. They shoot past me with such speed in a blur of bright colours and a smudge of expensive bike that I barely have time to shout out a good natured "well done!" (I am very polite to people I don't know). 4km to go and I'm starting to run out of beans - still going much faster than last year but I'm looking forward to the end. Head down and hang in there. And then... "hey Billy!" (add dopler effect yourself) as Eddie passes me. "Aghgrhgh" I cry and stand up on the pedals. He will not get away from me! He is 50 metres ahead of me before I have time to react, but I suddenly find that I DO have some energy left after all. I manage to hold my distance and even catch him up a little and close the gap to 20 metres. But then we hit some traffic: cars are slowing down because of bikes turning right into Taynuilt. Eddie takes no prisoners and cuts onto the right hand side of the road and starts overtaking like a demon. I'm not sure this is wise but follow him anyway. The cars seem quite docile. We turn off the main road onto the narrow road to the pier. Eddie just ahead of a BMW. The BMW driver decides to drive at 15mph for safety reasons (there are a lot of bikes around). Well, fine and dandy, but I WANT TO GO FASTER. He eventually sees me filling up his rear view mirror and puts his foot down. A kind marshall pulls some cars to the side to let me past and then I am stuck behind a kayak trailer. I can't complain; these are volunteers taking my kayak to the start of the race; but I'm still angry because I WANT TO GO FASTER. He too sees me swerving behind him and pulls over to let me past. The open road lies ahead. Well, not exactly open: it is littered with slow moving cyclists and pedestrians. With oozing ill-grace I cut past them all but do manage to shout out my thanks. There is Eddie right ahead, and (ha, ha) he's stuck behind a truck doing 10mph. I catch him up and we cruise the last 2 minutes at a snail's pace  He assures me that the only reason I caught him was traffic, and I am equally confident that the only reason I didn't pass him was traffic. Sigh, I guess we'll call it a draw. Our times were both 2h 08m.   Kayak   So now we have a couple of hours break before the kayak start. Always delayed because of the time it takes everyone to register and get ready we set off at 12.26pm. It's a mass start and I am about 1/3 of the way back through the field. I spend the first three minutes fighting my way through slots in the traffic. Then the water gets really choppy: there are boats sideways, a few capsizes, and everyone is looking for gaps. My fast, but unstable, boat is good at shooting through the gaps and it is easier to paddle at speed so I quickly cut out of the mass of paddlers. Ahead of me now are the hard core marathon boats and, annoyingly, Steve. He's in a river racer (slower than my boat) with 25 year old slalom blades. Technically, there is no reason why he is going so fast, damn him. I do pass him after about 10 minutes and he pops onto my wash and chats away. Damn him again. There are a few choppy waves and I accelerate hoping that the wash will get confused and he'll drop off. His voice fades and eventually stops - I think I've lost him. [I can't look behind me in my boat - I'd almost definitely fall in!] There is another marathon boat ahead of me and the paddler is obviously fit but not a canoeist. He has bad technique and I'm sure I can pass him. Bizarrely, he stays ahead. What is going on? My boat is as fast, his technique is bad. Grr. I hope that he has misjudged the pace and will fade soon. After about 40 minutes the water starts to get really choppy. Waves are breaking over the boat and hitting the cockpit. My cleverly designed bit of plastic, taped on around the spray deck with a foam block inside to give it shape, is very effectively shedding the water and I feel smug with myself (but thanks to Keith Brown for the idea - I would have sunk otherwise). The guy in front is a bit less sure in the waves and eases up. This is my chance and I scoot past him. But the waves are a bit scary. Not really big but I'm worried about falling in. There is no chance to roll a marathon boat and a capsize would mean a 15 minute loss of time whilst I was rescued. The scenery is absolutely beautiful but I can't spare any concentration to look at it. I am focused on my paddles and the waves within 10 metres of my boat and nothing else. I definitely feel that if I day dream I will be in. 20 minutes later the waves die down a bit and I can concentrate fully on going fast again. There are about 5 boats ahead of me. I say "about" because the lead guy (James Block) is so far ahead that I can't even see him. There is one guy who is about 400 metres ahead that I might be able to catch. He has veered off to the right and I think I might have the faster line. I am definitely holding my distance behind him now but I'm not making any impression on the gap. The end of the loch comes into view and it looks about 10 minutes away. Experience tells me that it will be a lot further than that. I'm hurting (and have been since the start) but feel strong and can keep the pace up. I can hear thumps and splashs behind me but dare not look round. It's either waves hitting the rudder, my paddle splashes on the back deck, or Eddie right behind me. I decide not to take any chances (the image of him passing me on the bike still vivid in my head) and up the pace. When I eventually finish I stop the clock and with the safety of the marshalls holding the boat look behind me: no one even close. Oh well, it was a good motivator! My time was 1h 32m.  Eddie comes in a few minutes after me and Steve behind him. Nonie puts in a very good time (she is in a slower boat than me) as does everyone else. The kayak section is strange: the exhaustion is completely different from the bike or run. But it's great to have finally got off that long, long loch.   Run   Time to eat a little and drink a lot. And stretch - my thighs and arse are still sore from the bike and I'm not entirely sure I can run more than a mile. A few practice jogs up and down the road only emphasize how stiff I feel. My right knee hurts and my left shin aches on every stride. None of which is too painful, but I worry what it will be like after 12 miles. Ah well, I decide to set off up the hill (you can choose when to start). I'm timing each mile and they seem reasonable (about 8 minutes). I am doing arithmetic as quickly as I can: it's 12.5 miles and my target is 1h 50m... by the time I've worked it out another mile has passed and I have a whole new set of calculations. Being slow at maths sure helps pass the time. It's actually going pretty well and I feel good up to mile 7. Then I start to shorten my stride and I'm slowing down - my usual fault. I really concentrate on  my style. I'm on target for 1h 50m and if I fall behind that then my goal of beating 5h 30m for the whole race is gone. It's hot and I'm sipping electrolyte from my hydration pack. I pick up some bottles of water from the water stations and swill out my mouth and pour some over my head. The miles go past very slowly now and from mile 8 - 11 drag on and on. And then it gets even harder. With half a mile to go I am looking at my watch trying to calculate my time. I think I can make it and it spurs me on - I don't pick up any speed but I am at least not dropping off. I have nothing left for a sprint finish (but I could probably have gone faster if Eddie had gone past me!) and 1h 45m gives me a total of 5h 26m and I'm very pleased with that - 3 or so minutes faster than my target. I resist the temptation to lie down in the cool grass and manage to stumble around eating and drinking whatever I can find. Phew.

      As a graduate of Leeds university, and partly due to living pretty much ON the Carlisle-Settle-Leeds railway line, I still spend a lot of time travelling to Leeds to visit my mates and party every now and again. Being as I don't own a car, I've always biked to a station and got the train: first Dent (2 miles), then Ribblehead (about 8 miles), then Settle (17 miles by road, 20 off-road)...  So, as my so called 'training' progresses, I get further away from work to the station. Fine. But the natural conclusion ahs to be to bike to Leeds, yeah? Yeah...  Obviously, I had to try one day, so, one sunny afternoon, with at least 2 nights off to recover, I set off from YHA Dentdale to seek my fortune on't way t't big city...  From Dentdale to Ribblehead is a nice ride, up a big hill on the road, then climb a little bit and descend on some nice moorland singletrack, watch out for the dogs as you fly through the farmyard etc etc... Ribblehead's a lovely place. Big viaduct. Ice cream van - no, I didn't stop.  A little more road brings me to Selside and the bridleway/BOAT across Ingleborough Common - wild moorland doubletrack, scraps of limestone pavement (ever tried riding on limestone? When it's dry, it's like riding on sandpaper. When wet, like riding on soap...). The view out across the common is beautiful, and the recent access restriction order means no more motorcrossers to avoid.  The lane down to Settle via Wharfe is technical double/single track with a lovely ford and stone bridge - time to test the trials skills again - and a little back road down to Stainforth and Settle...  From Settle, my nice safe knowledge of 'yeah, this is fine' is gone. I'm not at a 'point of no return', the railway runs pretty much exactly whe I'm riding so there's plenty of chance s for a 'sack this' moment, but the sun is shining, and I'm a sucker for sunny days on a bike.  I grind up the hill out of Settle, Sleipnir's knobblies treads singing quietly on the tarmac. It's a hard hill, but I'm in a good mood and it passes quickly. The next bit's boring: all road. We pass through Bentham and Hellfield quickly and head on to the place where I've told myself I can have an icecream is I want one: Skipton.  I ride into the middle of Skipton and find an appropriate shop, then go and sit by the canal. Enjoy my 99, it makes a change from the nutrigrain bars which are my standard fodder on long rides.  From here it gets interesting. 29 miles of quite scenic and quite lovely canal towpath. I've paddled this many years ago (OK, not that may, but a few) in a stage of the Trans-Pennine Canoe Race, but it was dark then and all I wanted was a dry pair of shorts. Now it's sun-dappled and lovely and all I want to do is ride. And it's flat. The only times i have to slow from cruising speed are to avoid pedestrians and dogs (and consequently a potential swim in some fairly yuk looking water) and under bridges (ditto...), so i sit at a constant cadence and aboput 14mph for 2 and a bit hours. The canal weaves it's way from Skipton via Gargrave, Keighley, Shipley and the top end of Bradford into the centre of Leeds, but you never feel 'urbanised', you're just riding along next to a canal, the stuff around you is trees and grass and fields, and citys are something that are happening to other people while you toddle along at whatever pace you like.   All in all, just over 6 hours later I arrive at Granary Wharf, Leeds quite happy. The afternoon has flown by, and a text message tells me there's burgers and cold Guinness waiting for me in the park...

      After an absence, two mountain days within a week was perfect !  A return to Arrochar and a return to Ben Narnain. Company this time was some friends of a girl that I work with. Mike was over from Canada and hoping to get a Munro tale to tell back home. Alan and Irene just looked over excited (a look which took some knocking out of them).  For those unfamiliar with the soon to be replace pipe track route of ascent, it has been described as:   “The start is a good warm up, taking a brutally direct line up the line of what was a rack and pinion railway used to construct part of the Loch Sloy catchment area for a hydro-electric scheme”    Brutal is about right. Over the years the erosion hasn’t helped either!  By the time we were at the point where the path takes an easier traverse line towards the Cobbler (we were continuing straight up), Mike’s knees had decided enough was enough. With about another 2000ft of climbing and a full 3000ft of descent the hard choice to descend was made.  The remaining folks continued up towards the summit whilst the cloud swung in and out either giving or stealing the view as it wanted. Just before the last push up to the trig point a sheltered lunch stop was chosen and Alan dished out a fantastic rice and veg dish with a selection of teas – tremendous!  Time was pressing when we arrived at the trig, so it was photographs, quick bearing and down towards the bealach between Narnain and Ime. Alan decided to make the descent a little more interesting by trashing his ankle a little – which looked sore. Few brufen he was back to skipping down again.  Last bit of the pipe track was made torture by the addition of the midges (doesn’t bode well for next weekends camp ?!?!?!?).  Back at the car (and with the Munro virginity lost) the pain in the legs for Alan and Irene seemed to be replaced with that over excited look that had started the day. Only another 283 mountains to go ….

      What do you get if you add a pretty girl, a humid night and an Audi TT ? The correct answer (but not probably the one that first comes to mind) is last nights Clydebank 10k Road Race.  A little explanation is required – the pretty girl is Nicola (my dentist), it  was  a little humid, she does drive a really nice black TT and after Helensburgh last week we were going to run together to try and get her a new PB.  The race start was, as always, mad – confusion to exactly where the start was and confusion to had the clock started. The congestion remained until the industrial park where there was an opportunity to spread out a little. Going through 3km a quick pace check indicated that we were on target. Settling down, we were bang on time for under 45 minutes at the half way mark. Unfortunately around 7km we had to slow up a little but Nicola put in a fantastic last 1k to finish in just over 48 minutes.   As tends to happen with 10k races … no matter how sore it is at the time, recovery is quick. Disheartened about not achieving a new PB ? Nope – there is always Dumbarton next week or Kirkintilloch on the 24th June or ………….

      The Cobbler is one of those hills that has something for everyone – unfortunately in our case it was rain !  Can’t remember exactly what age I would have been when I first gazed up the steepness of the pipe track path but it would have been in the company of my Dad, Uncle Jack and Alan for sure. Since then, there has been summer and winter climbing (including a few epics on Punsters, hilarity on Recess Route, ice axes and bad language from the Gnome to mention a few), day rambles and numerous hill running trips. The easy access from Glasgow also helps!  The original plan for the weekend had been a big backpack / camping shot with some Venture Scotland folks. Due to family illness and a new lass (for one of the other guys) the plan was scaled down to a single day gig. Just outside Paisley my mobile beeped to indicate that Gina had left her waterproofs in Edinburgh – brief glance through the windscreen indicated that was a bad move (which she remedied with a £12.99 top in Balloch).  After introductions in the car park, the team consisting of Rhidian, Mike, Raymond, Gina, Ailsa, Emma and myself (is it just me or are there more girls on the hill these days) made for the soon to be replaced path leading up towards Ben Narnain and the traverse round to towards the Allt a’ Bhalachain. Every combination of base layer and waterproofs was tried without much success. The cloud was ridiculously low with even the Narnain Boulder being covered! Quick bit of navigation tuition for Ailsa, before heading up into the Corrie where another two girls and a guy joined up with us. The rain got worse. Once at the bealach the decision was easy – “nae big traverse of the tops … simply got over the centre peak and get tae!” A couple of guys were roping up for threading the needle - one for another day.  Once down onto the grassy ridge that runs parallel (but above) the path we had come up and it was hands in pockets relaxed type stuff again. Possibly a little too relaxed as I managed to drop a little lower than ehhhh …… planned. This resulted in a battle with the forestry to regain the correct path – OPPS   Lesson for the day was concentrate on the nav rather than the sh!te patter.  Veggie burger, chips and some of Gina and Emma’s ice cream over at the Pit Stop (Ailsa had been wanting a skinny latte and a low fat muffin – typical Edinburgh lass) before heading up to Grandtully via Glasgow.  The weather wasn’t what we had hoped for but once again proof that the worst day on the hill is still better than the best day stuck inside !

      Just back from a weekend camping at Grandtully (NN913531). It's a lovely site run by the  urlLink Scottish Canoe Association  in an old station yard only about 200 metres from the rapids on the Tay. (If you want to book the site, call The Riverside Inn.) It was mostly a family camping weekend but we did manage to squeeze in some training too.  #1 - Friday evening. Heather W. (not daughter, in other words) and I went for a short hill run heading from Strathtay over towards Pitlochry. About 25 minutes up and then a few minutes running around on forest tracks one the top. I was finding it really hard to match Heather's flat ground speed. I'm starting to realise that my how-fast-I-can-run-for-10-minutes speed is not that much different from my how-fast-I-can-run-for-60-minutes speed. I need to work on that a bit (although I have no intention of running 10 minute races). It was certainly good practice for the 70 Wild Miles (which, to mix my units, includes a 20k run).   #2 - A bit later Friday evening. Nonie went off down the Tay a short way in her river racer. Very shallow and she ended up walking up some of the small rapids on the way back because it was too shallow to get her blade in. Annoyingly, those same rapids also got quite deep at the top so she ended up wading up to her waist and struggling to get back into her boat whilst hanging onto a tree!  #3 - Saturday afternoon. Nonie, Linda O., Heather W. and I went for the run from Strathtay over to Pitlochry and back. A bit like the previous day only we dropped down the otherside before returning: two tough climbs. Total time was 80 minutes for Heather and me. I can cope with putting my head down to grunt up hills, but again it was the challenge of opening up on the flat and downhill bits that I found hardest. It's mostly in my head, I'm sure.  #4 - Heather W. and Gordon [side note: Nonie, Heather, Gordon, Linda and Pyro are all in the same Heb Challenge team] did a practice swim on the Tay with Nonie supporting in her kayak. The idea being that it would be a bit like the sea (not flat like a swimming pool, murky and cold). They shot off downstream for about 300 metres and then tried to head back. They then realised how hard it is to swim against even a slow current. They could only barely make headway and ended up getting back with a bit of clawing/walking. Still, good practice!  #5 - Nonie, Graham and I did a 9 km  paddle on Loch Tay. Quite a stiff head wind (on the first half) but the waves were quite small. Nevertheless, it was pretty tough going. There is the physical extra drag of the headwind to contend with, the effect it has on your steering, and the shift in focus too. The latter is at least something I can work on. On the flat with no wind I find I can really focus on propelling the boat efficiently. With a wind or waves, I find myseld easing off a bit. It's hard to describe: it feels harder but my muscles are working less. I think there's a tendancy to say "these conditions make it hard for me to perform at my best, therefore there's no point trying 100%". Nonsense of course. I also had my usual swamping problem with my low lying marathon boat. The more water it gets in the lower it lies and the more water I get over the deck and the more it lets in, etc.. Keith Brown suggested some arrangement with taped down polythene over the deck to try and divert the waves a bit. I'm going to experiment a bit. It would be crazy to lose the advantage of a fast boat by having to empty out half way.  #6 - Heather W. had another swim session - this time on Loch Tay. No problem with depth this time, but the waves make it hard to breathe. Graham cheered her up: "Despite the pain, I can really enjoy the biking and running on the Heb Challenge. And I can imagine the kayaking being fun. But the swimming? That just looks plain hard." (Paraphrased from bad memory.)  We filled in the rest of the weekend with kayaking and canoeing with kids and the day-to-day chores of camping. All of which is a lot more tiring than adventure racing. Managed to get a lot of kids and adults wet above and in the water. But more about that elsewhere.

      Some background first. We ran the first Challenge in November 1999 and we've done one or two a year since then. It's a combination of mountain biking and walking. It's not a race - we all stick together as a friendly bunch of folk. The challenge bit is seeing if we all make it back. The Challenges all finish at our house so part of the challenge has been to come up with original routes each year. We've had anywhere between 7 and 16 people and some people do it as a relay.  This year's start was beside Backwater Reservoir (about 20 minutes drive away). Only a few minutes behind schedule, we set off at 09.20 heading north for Craigie Thieves: Ian "Bownsie", Senja, Ian "ITN", Gary, Callum, Biffo the dog and me. I spiced up the otherwise mundane road section (the first kilometre) by dropping Biffo's lead beside the road and Bownise jumped at the chance to run back to get it. "Fetch Bownise! Fetch!" said Biffo and Bownsie obediently complied.  Before long we were starting the gentle climb up onto the plateau that bridges the glens of Isla, Prosen, Clova, Doll and Shee. Once up on the plateau there is an enticing bagful of hills within reach and it takes restraint to stop yourself wandering off for a few days. We settled for the relatively close but intriguingly named Craigie Thieves (689 metres). The path was varied: sometimes a Land Rover track, sometimes a sheep track, sometimes a pooled bog and our speed varied accordingly. The air was windy and speckled with teasing drops of rain - it was hard to know what to wear with everyone swapping between shorts and waterproofs. But visibility was good (for navigation if not for views). A slight confusion (good natured, right Bownsie?) and we found Craigie Thieves and dwelt there a while to take it all in. The clouds were rushing overhead but with plenty of blue sky to inspire confidence. Nothing too worrying but it would surely rain hard soon. Glen Prosen with the Prosen Water was visible to the east; the river meandering its way down towards Kirriemuir, sparkling in the sun. We traced out hills and routes we'd taken on previous trips and our minds wandered back to relive them.         But the wind flustered through us on the exposed peak and we quickly carried on to the north-west, dropping down into the Glack of Balquhader pass. It was slow going - steep and heathery and we needlessly man-handled Biffo over a deer fence twice on the way. As soon as we'd dropped down onto the top of the pass (we were perpendicular to the normal path) it was time to climb up the other, steep side and onto Broom Hill. Beyond that on Bawhelps (830 metres) the weather was turning bitingly worse. It was now very windy (force 5, I'm guessing) and with a not-quite-sleet-but-close-enough rain. Visibility was dropping so we quickly double-checked maps and bearings and headed west to go down to Auchavan (in Glen Isla) where Nonie was waiting with the Land Rover and bikes. Bownsie and Gary looked at the maps a little more closely and discovered that we were actually about 400 metres south of where we thought we were but we could adjust our route a little so it was okay. It was now only about 2k to the transition but it did seem to drag on a little. I'd underestimated the time it would take and we eventually turned up at the Land Rover 40 minutes late (it had taken 4 hours 10 minutes) - I think that was mostly down to the terrain and lack of paths.  The Land Rover was full of friendly faces and we were met with a rush of children to cheer us on. Nonie and Jane had unloaded the bikes and were waiting with coffee and sandwiches (thanks!). The rain had now settled in: not particularly heavy, but very enthusiastic. Half an hour later and everyone had changed footwear and clothing and pumped up tyres and we were ready for the second stage. Senja and Callum (Callum is 12 and had done a remarkable job of keeping up with the tough pace) headed back to the house with Nonie, and Jane joined us so now we were five.  The first 8k was a fast road section, tempered by the strong, wet head wind. And then, tantalisingly close to the pub (see later) we headed up the hill south out of Brewlands Bridge. This hill has featured a lot in the challenges over the years and it is remembered bitterly by most. It's about a 20 minute climb without much chance to rest. Once at the top, we jinked left to go straight back down again! But this time it was off-road along part of the Cateran Trail. Pretty good fun, with lots of ruts, heather and rocks to keep you on your toes.  The next section was a 12k circular route around Glenmarkie forest: muddy but good tracks with a fair bit of climbing. We whizzed round - enjoying the final swooping 3k back down to the road. The rain picked up again (it had been sunny for a while) which cheered us up no end as we headed for the Glenisla Hotel for a quick beer :) It was pretty quiet inside with just one customer on his bar stool. He gave us lots of unsolicited advice about the quickest way to get home but completely failed to comprehend that we didn't necessarily want to go home the quickest way. I had planned a slight detour to take in a river crossing and he was at a loss as to why we weren't going to take the much more convenient bridge. We left him pondering and returned to the sunshine again.  A short 3 or 4k on the road and then we headed down across a field and stopped before the River Isla. The level was low and this was, according to tradition, a ford but we all hesitated about riding across. Bownsie put pride before sense and bravely set off into the water only to come to a complete stop after 2 metres. Damn, now we all had to try. And we all did, with Gary giving the best impression of someone actually expecting to make it - but none of us made much headway and we ended up wading across. Then, a steep grassy climb up the other side to get back to the track that we should have been on if we'd followed the bar stool route. Everyone was relieved to learn that it was only 2k along a track to go - to waiting children and friends. Not to mention the fridged beer and ovened food :) It had been a long day: four hours walking and three hours biking (plus transition and pub which don't really count) totalling 51k. Well done to all who challenged. And a double well done to Nonie for the child care, cooking and transition logistics. What more could we ask for?  These Challenge weekends are wonderful: the ideal combination of friends and hills (and this time a river too). We manage to get the challenge about right I think - hard enough that you have to push yourself, but easy enough that we can all keep together as a group and still have enough energy to party in the evening. It would be nice if we could involve some of the children now they are bigger (although they have a darn good time playing at the house). We might initiate a junior version on the Sunday next time… Thanks for coming everyone.

      The Heb and Rat Race have been fantastic. "But what next" I hear people cry (maybe only in my head, but hey...).  I'm gonna be out of the groove for a while, but looking to get back into it for September time. I'm going to spend the rest of the time faffing, planning and basically being an Armchair Adventure Racer. And they say that forewarned is forearmed  (and if you're forearmed you can hold twice as many swords...)  , So I'm posting a list of events that I'm looking to do in the future, and if anyone else wants in on the jollies, mail me or post summat.   26th Sept - Carsington Water Challenge, Carsington, Derbyshire  3 hour, 3 person mixed teams. Have a girly in the form of Katy Curtis, Canadian AR'r who's coming to Leeds Uni in September.   2nd Oct - Ace Race, Southern Scotland.  2 day, 4 person mixed teams. Pyro, Katy + + ?  9/10th Oct - Polaris Challenge, Lake District  2 day Trailquest event. Enteringpairs with the Canadian again. She's gonna be really hacked with me by this point, I suspect...  Anything else around then that people can think of and need people for, give me a shout.   Smoke me a kipper...   Pyro

      I've posted Nonie's blog for the Hebridean Challenge. In five parts, dated on the day they happened. But that means that they can get lost in the long list of old blogs. So this entry is just to point back to them. Here's  urlLink day 1 .

      I had my first experience of "proper" mountain biking last weekend. When I say "proper" I mean with marked trails and good tracks and hills and banked bends and things.  As compared to biking over hills along whatever tracks you can find. I think I prefer being out in the wild but it makes an exciting change.     Met up with Neil Baxter in Edinburgh, picked up Davey Cuthill and then headed out to Glentress to meet Tony Tickle there. All four of us are doing the Grand Canyon in October and this seemed like a good excuse to disguise some fun on bikes as training. After a bit of faffing around with pumps, inner tubes and stuff we headed up the wide forest track. Very quickly we were up into the trees and speeding up hill along a narrow track. I was already having fun - going up hill round where I live is a lot harder than this.  The ground is very dry and it's fast going. We stop at the top car park (why would you drive half way up the hill?) and have a wee stretch to pretend that we're athletes.   A bit more climbing and we are rewarded by our first downhill section. Ooh, this is fun. I'm on the brakes quite a bit, but the bike is shaking and rattling and I'm going as fast as I dare. All too soon we are at the bottom of the section and we shift back into climbing mode.      The sun is shining and we're all dazzled by the dappled plunges of green around us. We can see rolling hills to the south and we have frequent stops to absorb it all. This time we climb for a lot longer and we eventually reach the top (of our route). It's been a steep climb but, surprisingly, it's been a lot of fun. And we still have the downhill to go.     We push off down the red route and I'm slowly learning how fast I can go. It's easy too go to slowly and cruise down but my efforts to keep up with the others stretch me a little. Some of the hairpins are banked which is something to learn about. You can go faster, of course, but you have to watch out: if you carry on accelerating round the corner you get higher and higher up the bank. If you come off the top then you are going to be flying into the trees.     There have been some forestry operations so we cut onto the black run to see if the surface is better. This is fun. Then it starts to get really steep. Up to now you could get down anything just by slowing down. But now I'm doing 1ml/hour and it's still scary. Neil is ahead and he locks up his front wheel and over he goes in a graceless fall over the handle bars. Ha, ha, laughs all round. With the benefit of his experience I get down and look round just in time to see Tony do the same.  Ha, ha, laughs all round. Tony doesn't move. Laughter stops. "Tony, Tony! Speak to us, Tony!". But he talks and we are less worried. Davey extricates him from his bike frame which seems to have entwined itself around him. All seems fine, but Tony is grumbling ever so slightly and blood trickles down his leg. He's got these "bear trap" pedals. A clever invention with sharp spikes on the pedals so that your shoe doesn't slip off the pedal. Trouble is, they also make an effective weapon (in situtations when your bike turns against you).     Neil becomes all efficient and suggests that we get Tony back to the car before his body's own drugs wear off and we need to add some more of our own. In fact, Neil gets so efficient that he speeds off down the track on his own - only to turn back after a couple of minutes and wait for the rest of us! I wistfully look at the remaining black section that we are bypassing. I'll be back to do that another day. We get back to the car within about 10 minutes and we start to look at the leg. It's looks bit dirty and we decide to just give it a quick wash and antiseptic wipe and get him to hospital.     40 minutes later in Edinburgh and he's being cleaned and stitched up and we're all happy again. And thanks to the glorious NHS we're back in time for our planned beers and curry. We nip to Montpelier's in Bruntsfield to try and remember how nice it used to be. Then a fantastic curry at the Himilaya. Followed by better beer and even better whisky at The Ettrick Hotel. Thanks for a great start to the weekend guys!

       Sunday 4th July 2004    It sounded like a plan …  Work an “easy” nightshift, grab some sleep on Gina’s floor then a ramble up and down Ben Ledi before heading back to Edinburgh to see Bonnie Raitt at the Usher Hall. In the end the shift went horribly wrong and I only made it to Gina’s for a cup of coffee before Ailsa picked us up. Don’t think I saw the end of the street and was gently woken in Callander about an hour later.  Last time I was up on Ben Ledi was with my favourite Texan (who put Lance Armstrong into 2nd place) – a lass called Wendy. This time was with a group consisting of Emma, Gina and Ailsa. The previous route was reversed saving the aptly named “stank glen” for the descent. Weather was pretty much everything – heat and sun to start with, wind and rain on the summit, dry and breezy on the descent.  There is something special about being in the mountains with girls – LUNCH !  In the same way Wendy always brought an interesting change to my garage bought stuff, this time was no different. Can’t remember who brought what but as we sheltered just off the summit cairn, a selection of oat cakes, goats cheese, camanbert and cashew nuts were passed about.  Once back at the car it was sleep time again for me … for an hour at least. Still plenty of time to catch up on that mid-week.

       Sunday 31st August 2003  - A last dose of revision for the imminent Mountain Leader assessment was planned for the Sunday afternoon. The venue was the crags low in Coire na Ciste on Cairngorm. During training this location was midge hell! Apparently, this was on the only known occasion that an ML training course was forced of the hill by the wee menace! Things had been going well with direct, indirect belays, Thompson knots etc... during a classic abseil Jasmin's feet lost contact with the rock and she rotated out and swung into a rock corner, hitting it square with her back. Quick rescue and she was back at the top of the crag and in the South African abseil position - but the back didn't feel right ...   ---------------------------------    Wednesday 30th June 2004  - In the end, her back was as far from “right” as it can be. A severely bruised spine, two nights in hospital and 8 weeks later and it was still sore and unable to bear any additional weight. Withdrawing from the 2003 assessment was inevitable even before it started.  That afternoon was relived a few times following a phone call from Jas to say she was heading back to Glenmore Lodge in July 2004 to complete what had been started 11 months before. The main purpose of the call had been to arrange a mock assessment style expedition. From her point of view, it was an opportunity for preparation from my point of view it was an opportunity to play “assessor” (as opposed to just an “ass”) and to ehhhh … bag a handful of subsidiary tops needed for the collection.  With free weekends being scarce, we opted for a wee mid-week gig. The format was simple 3 nights wild camping with loads of navigation and route finding on steep ground in between times.  Bite to eat and a pint in Café Mambo then up the ski road to the usual tramp up to Coire an t-Sneachda and the goat track. Some folks have complained about the repetitive nature of using this access up to the Cairngorm Plateau. I prefer to think of it as visiting an old friend you haven’t seen in a while. Once at the bealach the fun began – an easy start with the summit of Cairn Lochan being the first nav target (yup – one of the subsidiary tops cattled). The next few hours were spent with some more ambitious features e.g. specific index contours, indistinct cols before the first camp over at the twin lochans on Carn Etchachan.   Next morning it was time for Jas to find a suitable route and lead down from the summit of Carn Etchachan dropping down the steep boulder strewn slopes to Loch Etchachan. From there, we headed up Beinn Mheadoin for another wee top then onto another hard to find contour ending with the descent down to the Hutchison hut and lunch. The day continued with the ascent up onto the bulk that forms Derry Cairngorm and onwards to the top of the “tailors” burn below the summit of Ben Macdui. A decision had to be made – drop down into the Lairg Ghru and head for Braeriach (optimistic eh ?) or camp until it was dark and some night nav. We choose the later as it was more relevant (plus we were tired and hungry). Tent up, fed and into the sleeping bags for a snooze.  For some reason I woke … at 00:50 !!! Sleeping in for night nav is just plain embarrassing. Within ten minutes, packs were packed and the we were off towards the summit of Macdui. Sounds silly but the views were amazing ! To the left we had a full moon breaking through the drifting mist and by the time we had visited the RAF memorial, north summit, a couple of index contours – we were seeing the start of sunrise in the east. By about 03:30 it was too light to continue and the tent was up again.  Next morning we continued over towards Lurchers with the emphasis being on timing and accurate pacing.  Mid-morning and we were down on the route back to the car. For some reason people do look at you strange when you are descending at the same time of day they have only just got out onto the hill – can’t think why. The fantasy food conversation was in full tilt by the time we reached the café down at the ski centre. The lass behind the counter informed us that if we wanted hot food then we had to go to the “restaurant” at the top of the funicular – ehhhh NAW ! So back down to Aviemore it was.  For Jasmin, there is only the real assessment to go now …

        "When first I came unto this land, And the roads lay bare before me. And the miles and miles of eagle feather wind, Blew through the singing valley...   There's so much could be said about the Hebrides, and about the Challenge itself, but the words don't always work. Once you've been there, there are things stuck in your head that don't want to be written down, or trapped in silver nitrate - they're utterly personal. Well, the Heb Challenge is both brutal and beautiful, and the combination does the same thing, but to greater effect. Pain, joy, beauty, humour and frustration, all in one 5 day, sleep deprived dose.    ...if i had heard any name or word There'd be none could well describe it For my heart was the heart of beast and bird And they spoke to me their language."   I can't possibly recount every inch of the race, but it would be good to put some of the best bits down, some of the silliest, and some of the just plain entertaining:  The team consisted of captain Nonie, Heather, Linda, Gordon and Pyro. We were team Pyro & the Vets - the amusement started with trying to find a name, but a pun on Benny and the Jets won out. Some of the training has already been recounted here by myself and others, but it was realised early on that I'd not have a chance to meet the rest of the team before being 'on the brink' already.    "is this the calm before the storm, or the storm before the calm?"   Meeting at Oban, feeling ropey from one too many pints of 80/- in the Ben Nevis, watching Linda get progressively greener on the ferry out, meeting up with old friends like the One.Tel team and new friends like H4 and Hitchhikers, camping for 3 nights on the machair, waking to the surf and going to sleep to the rain. Epic planning sessions, wrangling over who, what, when and where (fortunately, no-one ever posed a 'why'...). Intimate Bike Surgery in a car park when I realise the chainrings are worn enough to slip.    "Spread your arms, hold your breath, and always trust your cape."   Being the only team to beat the 'only 2 bikes' rule on day 1 by using scooters, paddling along, realising that despite a nice expensive, lightweight boat, I was destined to be near the back of the pack (mental note: kayak polo is  not  a good training method for 20-odd km paddling days...), having a lunch stop at Castlebay and already being badly in need of pie, finishing at Aird Mor, travelling back to the site of last years ceilidh and being fed IPA by the H4 team while one of their team members was in agony with cramp.    "Where the eagle glides descending,there's an ancient river bending, through libraries and museums, galaxies and stars"   Watching Nonie get more out of the Inuk than I ever could when she came in first on the sound crossing, MTBing across the machair on South Uist past a hostel I stayed in 5 or 6 years ago, wheels spinning in deep sand. Having tea and sandwiches at transition while Gordon hacked up Beinn Mhor, then blasting off for 3 stages on the trot - MTB, road bike and run, dragging my sorry carcass up Eaval and Bunabhal behind Gordon, trying just to get to the finish before I died.    "Still the wind lifts me up, so light am I, and it blows me on and on, Far above this place I've given the name 'home'...   Hacking round Lochmaddy bay to the top checkpoint on the kayak mystery stage, being one of only 2 teams to get all the checkpoints, flatting on the way back (didn't realise then but this was due to a cracked rim weld) and getting very frustrated changing a tyre with very bendy cheap tyre levers, then hacking back in a real mood, only to be told we had a time out (blooming typical). Racing off and grimly hanging on to Linda, Heather and Gordon as we pelotoned it to the ferry terminal, Gordon putting £1 into the vending machine on the ferry and it not letting him have his crisps (schadenfruede, I know, but...). Driving into Tarbert, setting up and then blasting off for one of the best MTB loops available, struggling up the big hill on the Rhenigadale path, knowing exactly how Rob felt last year, then hammering the descent and having enough left on the road leg to Scalpay to catch 7 minutes on the guy in front.    ...I long to see the living tree that heart and hearth hath grown, In a land that's not just made of dirt and stone."   The long wait at transition while Heather ran, Linda biked and Nonie paddled, having tea and cakes with One.Tel and H4, then cruising along the road with H4 and Friends of Genghis to start the MTB time trial. More long drags, the frustration of a slipping granny cog, meaning I couldn't attack on the climbs like I should have. More epic descents as well, both steep, technical and just plain cool. The last offroad hill, worried I'd passed the checkpoint, then finding Gordon's little 'signpost' to the sheiling. being paced up the last hill, then tagging, pulling in, and falling over still clipped to the bike.  Having a bit of rest, then setting off to paddle up the side of Great Berneray while Nonie blasted past on her road bike, with the 'big bloke' from FoG drafting off her (would have been better the other way round...), hating the swell round the headland, then surfing in to the 'meet teams and portage' section to find I was short of a team. Running across the bogs in a BA and portage boots to stop the clock, and watching Matt fall out of his boat while getting in on the lochans. Supporting Heather for the swim and then running up the road to the hall paddles in one hand and boat in the other.    "Why do I keep f**king up?"   Puncture. Again. Same reason, waiting on the side of the road for the van to catch me to change the bike. Nonie blasting in from a road bike sectiobn to find the others asleep in the van. Laughing at H4 as Ant rode off with Rhoda's map. Going knee deep in a bog. Getting in the boat on friday morning expecting another racing slog, only to find we were having a social paddle. Finishing said paddle at 9am, and waiting 'til 1pm for a pickup, being fed by each consecutive team as they came to get their paddlers. Another slog of a road bike leg, then running across the heather, thinking 'only 3 1/2 km to go'. Hitting checkpoint 166 spot on, despite trying to do fine nav on a 1:50,000 map. Misplacing Linda temporarily. Jogging through the woods to the finish, stopping occasionally to stop Linda hyperventilating.  The last run to the finish.   Crossing the line, feeling close to tears.  Shaking hands, hugging and congratulating other teams and each other.  Cheering in the last finishers.    "...and he drew that bow across those strings, it made an evil hiss, And a band of demons joined in, it sounded something like this..."    Dancing the Orcadian Strip the Willow, spinning Claire off her feet. Jon 'Raffling' the top kit prize. Moira's 'Paddler's Paddler' prize and Jas Hepburn's impromptu poem. Dancing, drinking, chatting, swapping e-mails.  Sleeping.  Fried breakfast.  Sleeping in the van. Stopping for another 'transition' when H4 shredded a tyre (don't know where, I just woke up and started getting ready to run...)  Bill cooking for us.  Getting up early (again!) to go paddling on the Tay.  FINALLY managing to get a smooth surf on Stanley wier (thanks Bill and the two Ians!)  More sleeping.  Thinking "hmmm. Rat Race in 1 week. Better start carbo loading..."  That's enough from me. I can't put into words the feeling of accomplishment, joy and relief, but anyone who reads this who knows the feeling will remember. I'll end with another quote.    "When first I came unto this land, And the road lay bare before me, And the miles and miles of eagle feather winds Blew through the singing valley. If I'd seen then where we are now, Would my path have been a straight one Into the heart of the nameless wild To live and sleep, Not lonely, but alone."

       Friday : an even earlier start – kayaks had to be at start (northern end of Gt Bernera – Bostadh) for 06.30 but in order for vans then to drive round to where they needed to be we revised this to 06.00 i.e. leave hall at 05.30. Clouttie dumpling in mouth, Pyro and I headed up to Bostadh to leave me with kayak to await kayak start. Lovely clear and warm AM – again forecast winds (Force 5) and deteriorating weather simply didn’t appear (got windy later in the day – for the kayakers road bike time trial, of course – but that’s later). Met Joe, (solo) and Lindsay who had camped night there – thought that I could have done that with kids if we’d been following Bill in the race. Fabulous camp spot, lovely beach.  Fabulous paddle, mass start so a true race for once. Bit of caution about the swell coming in from north west but in fact it was fine – moderate swell but no wind and no chop so still felt pretty stable and very paddleable. Pyro had had only rough seas of whole race day before when they rounded other side of Gt Bernera coming up Loch Rog an Ear and met some chop at the headland (then had to be diverted from planned route into beach to avoid mountains of stranded jellyfish heaped on beach). Charged round the corner at Siaram Bostadh – James and Callum already gone but I hung on to Anthony’s coat tails and refused to give up fourth place as we slogged and surfed down between Pabaigh Mor and Bhacsaigh to the beach at Bhaltos. One of our shorter race legs – only c. 40 mins.  Came in fourth (but only just!) to accompany Gordon on swim along beach – beautiful, took a few photos while trying not to bash G on head with rudder.   Leap out of kayak as G finished to tag L off on short hill section; I handed over kayak to Pyro, (doing next race leg) and ran up beach with G and H back to bus to get changed to do road bike leg after L came off hill – only a 20 minute run so had to be speedy. L came tanking in and I set off on road bike with L, G and H in bus chasing me off Bhaltos isthmus and off to west Uig. Legs tired and got my gears wrong on first hill but after that got my head down and felt stronger again. Only 8 or 9 km to point where bus waiting (just behind Uig beach) with G ready to set off on long hill run over Suaineabhal and Teinneasabhal and down to L/R track where he was to meet H (biking in from gravel pit where track joins road). Bus, L, H and N round to gravel pit to drop H off with mt bike so she could cycle in and swap over with G – H to do Snaidibridh and Mealasabhal up above Mealasta on the coast (where we started epic paddle into Reasort and down to Huisinish last year). H set off and N and L waited just off road at end of L/R track for G to come back out with mt bike. Even had a wee sleep! Very sociable – lots of other teams waiting there for people coming off hills in various directions. Only about 4 teams (of which we were one) attempting all the hills on this section.  G in and we drove round to wait for H. Fabulous views, fantastic beaches on drive round. Another pleasant wait, L ready to do her road bike bit back to Miabhaig where we were to collect Pyro coming in from kayak section.  H came in off hill looking really strong – tough ascent and descent, boulder scrambling at top but she’d made good time. Linda away and we drove back round to collect Pyro. Now about 2PM and it turned out second kayak section had turned into a cruise (by general paddler consent and fact that winds were rising) so Pyro had had good fun that AM but had then been waiting at Miabhaig since 9AM!! Collected kayak and got Pyro ready to take over from Linda when she arrived – Pyro on mt bike with slicks doing next rd bike section down to southern end Loch Rog Beag – set off in bus to chase him and found home by side of road with another puncture!!  Screeched to halt, gacve him N’s road bike and he set off again while G fixed puncture and discovered a split weld on the wheel frame which was probably responsible for Pyro’s multiple punctures. Luckily we had a time-out at next stop where I had to start kayakers’ road bike time trial section so no great rush to fix puncture and follow P down road to checkpoint. Then N on bike for time trial from end Loch Rog Beag to end Loch Rog and Ear – only about 9k but disappointingly my legs now feeling bike-tired and the forecast Force 5 wind now arriving (and yes, from NE so it was a head wind!). Didn’t feel as good as day before but did what I could and it passed very quickly – then more complicated hand-over to 4 bikes (G, L, H and P) to get last points required to make our 150 total for the week. I followed on in bus (in case of more punctures) as they retraced the route I’d cycled in opposite direction day before along the red road back to Acha Mor and down to Luirbost. Here, between us we managed to get lost looking for a left turn in Luirbost back towards Stornoway (turned out it was helpfully and incorrectly signposted Ranais and not Stornoway – wonderful chat with dear lady from whom we asked directions. She was most concerned that we should not take that road as it was very windy and narrow – we just wanted to know if it was the road we were pointing to on the map!!!!).  Off again – very happy to see marshal (Pyro’s pal Jeff) at checkpoint and then final orienteering bit with Pyro, Nonie and Linda/ Heather each doing different checkpoints across soggy moorland Mointeach Airinis south of Stornoway.  Very irritatingly I got mine despite (I thought) following right bearing – instead ended up at Heather and Linda’s checkpoint!! At least I then knew I was wrong and which direction to head back to find mine. H came with me to help and we found it quite quickly and slogged across deep heather and bog and steep rocks along side of one of larger lochans to forest edge where we were to meet Pyro and Linda. Unfortunately Linda had by now got lost after H left her so we regrouped, left H on most prominent hillock and P and I went in different directions along coast road. H very worried because L was so tired but L appeared soon after, running in from south – had got completely lost but worked out where she was and came back the right way after a bit of a detour!!   Last slog in across the woodland to west of Stornoway harbour, L struggling now and hyperventilating so we took it slowly, jogged and walked into castle grounds via Cuddy Point (starting point from last year!) where Gordon was waiting for us. Ran across finish line for a very welcome greeting from assembled marshals and principal of College and then hung around for a bit to cheer in Friends of Genghis when we heard they were coming in a few minutes behind us. Several other teams turned up all washed and ready to party, having got in ahead – hugs and congratulations all round. Tired, smelly, sweaty, relieved, satisfied, sad, already starting to think of the next time – ready for a wash and food!!!!!  Headed to the hostel for rapid showers and then to British Legion (fortuitously about 200m from hostel!!) for food, phone home, bottle of wine, chocolate, prize giving (lovely and unserious – what was Jon’s comment – “the winners always come first and get the prizes” so he did opposite and awarded prizes for “best newcomers” (Friends of Genghis) etc. etc.. We won a bottle of wine for being the team with a more mature palate……Summed it all up really.

       Thursday : yes – an early start! Got Linda ready on her bike – her turn to do the swoopy road back to Tarbert, then tag Heather for hill run over peaks north of Tarbert, who was then to tag Linda again for (another!) road bike up to Abhainn Suidhe castle.  Meanwhile, P and G had a lazy morning (!) getting ready for their mt bike through the hills of North Harris. We’d decided on a tactical dumping of the big hill running time trial in order to save peoples’ legs so we could still get all required points (150) by end of Day 5 and not be hours behind all the other teams today. The dumped time trial was the peaks north of Abhainn Suidhe and south of Loch Resort (Ceartabhal, Tiroga Mor etc.) which I think Iona ended up doing on her own in Team 70% last year.   Meanwhile, I was dropped back at my boat at top of West Loch Tarbet for a timed race (set off as our road bikes came into the checkpoint) to Abhainn Suidhe. The idea was that either road bike or kayak tagged the time trial hill runner at Abhainn Suidhe (only about 4 teams put up time trial hill runner but all kayaks and road bikes still did their race legs).  Some of the slower kayakers had fast road bikers in their teams and vice versa so I was left chatting on start line with James, Callum, Anthony until Linda stormed in and set me off – at least having slower kayakers ahead meant we had someone to chase but after catching two people it was then a long hard slog up the Loch – beautiful and very calm again but monotonous. It’s quite nice to be able to see where you’re going from the start but it doesn’t half make it seem slow as the land around changes only every so slightly as you slog your guts out and the bum starts screaming in pain (didn’t seem to get my seat pad right this year or maybe my bum is less padded than in the past!). Also – it was much the same view we had enjoyed day before on cruise back from Taransay!! Finally the inlet to Abhainn Suidhe appeared, Anthony cruised past me and I slogged it out to the line trying to catch the slowest of the solo paddlers. Head down so hard I almost missed seeing the castle! Very welcome rest, chat to Linda – her bum sore too from all the road biking. She had brilliant idea of asking Woody and the other safety boat crew if they would give a few of the bikers a lift back to Tarbert (they were now meant to cruise back on road bikes, having finished race leg). Of course they said yes and loaded up bikes and bikers for a wild ride back to checkpoint M32 (inlet north of Tarbet where Abhainn Suidhe  road joins main road up centre of Harris).  We kayakers of course still had to slog along on another “cruise” – effectively same one as yesterday, back to same checkpoint where buses were waiting and mt bikers setting off on the mt bike time trial. Again I struggled – convinced I was going to fall asleep and fall in!    Finally made it to the bus, saw Pyro cycling up side of Loch to start of mt bike time trial and Gordon went off a bit later. Then drive with H and L up to next checkpoint – end of mt bike time trial to await our two triallers.  Nice place to stop at top of Loch Seaforth and a good long break to get fed and changed for my new activity (splitting road bike time trial with Heather) – Pyro to do kayak leg later in day. Gordon won the battle of the time triallers and came in looking suitable muddy and knackered. Pyro soon after also looking knackered – for a while I thought I might have to jump back into kayak later to keep Pyro alive but he rallied (as youngsters do!!). Heather off on road bike after a slight hiatus with screw falling out of cleat on her shoe – rapid change of footwear (Nonie to Heather and Pyro to Nonie – similar sized feet in a Heb team is a big advantage!!). Chased H up the road in the bus and she seemed to be going well. Stopped in our allotted layby and I got ready on side of road to take over on same bike as she leapt off. Worked well and I got my head down and chased the Friends of Ghengis biker ahead. A few hills heading north then turned west and started to blast along the red road towards Berneray and Uig. Kept catching FoG biker on the hills then he would get away from me on the downhills – most odd and frustrating. Finally settled in behind him (not allowed to draft on time trial so I just sat close enough to get some shelter from the (inevitable and ubiquitous) head wind). Finally got past him after Berneray turn-off and left him behind after he’d drafted me for a bit. So good to change activities and feel I could really push at something – and completely different sitting position so even my bum was fine! Feeling really strong and came screaming in to check point M37 to carry on up the side road to Hotel Scaliscro at end of which Gordon was meant to be waiting to be tagged – to realise Gordon and Heather were leaping around beside the van, not ready!! They had all been asleep or chatting. Meandered along yellow road until Gordon caught me up on his bike, then speeded down to end, saw G set off on his hill run and pushed his bike back out along out to van, while riding mine (one controlled crash when I realised I couldn’t reach brake one-handed and decided that ending up in a heap on the sphagnum with bikes on top of me was safest option).   Drive round to await Gordon coming off his hill run – decided to split this section with L doing a road bike bit in middle to relieve G’s tired legs. Waited and waited. Checked and checked that we were in right place. An hour went by – very pleasant, sunny, beautiful spot, but we’d thought Gordon would be much less than an hour. An hour and half – Heather saw movement at top of hill (Gordon?) but then nothing more for ten minutes. Then Robin from One.Tel came marching across the bog below us from completely the wrong direction (?) shouting at someone on her mobile phone to fetch the bus in to meet her (we thought mobiles weren’t allowed!). Then more movement of sheep and Gordon appeared – very knackered, had got lost, set off too fast after I woke him up from his slumbers and never quite got himself orientated! Jumped in bus while Linda linked G’s running legs with (another!) road bike up to final check point just south of Gt Bernera.  Drove bus on to Gt Bernera realising that we were now going to be late for Pyro and his portage out of sea into fresh water loch at old Norse Mill just east of Breacleit. Realised how slow our brains were becoming with exhaustion and lack of sleep – 3 of us had been sitting waiting for Gordon for an hour and half while we could easily have driven up to Gt Bernera (or biked) and dropped  someone off to help with portage. Drove up leaving Linda and Gordon at last check point, H dropped me off to run across moor and just miss Pyro and his portage by about 5 minutes. He had (gallantly) yomped across moor in his full canoe gear and wet suit booties to stop the clock as we weren’t there to help with portage. I raced after him, missed again (he was now on his way back to kayak) and finally caught up with him to help with mini-portages in middle of paddle down Loch nan Geadraisean. One.Tel doing similar manoeuvres – this was where Matt their paddler managed to “swim” while trying to get back in boat after a shallow bit (he too had had to yomp along moor in canoe kit!). Final portage across into Loch Breacleit to find H waiting for swim and L also arrived on bike to help. Sprint around the Loch while H swam and Pyro supported – to help at northern end with final portage and run up to community hall and finish. G in from last leg of run.  Good finish and good fun despite some rather rocky organisation in final hour or two!   Final night of planning with cotton wool for brains and slightly frayed nerves and tempers. Very good food again – even left out Clouttie dumpling for breakfast. Crash.   Go to  urlLink Day 5 .

       Wednesday : yet another early start – down to Lochmaddy for mystery stage. First a swim round headland (Heather supported by Nonie) then immediately into free stage – collecting as many checkpoints (in order) as we wanted to go for around Lochmaddy. Three had to be visited simultaneously by kayak and land based (runner or biker), other four on islands for kayak alone to visit. Whole thing to be completed in less than 90 minutes or penalties incurred. Set off hard but very difficult to read poor copy of 1:25000 map on deck with wet map case and early sun shafting down. Followed James as closely as I could until (quite soon!) he vanished behind islands. After that pretty much on my own – Callum overtook too but his land runners missed checkpoints and no other teams tried for them all so James’ and my teams ended up being only two to complete that stage without penalties. Great to come storming in and see Linda and then Pyro exactly where they should be! Fun stage once I got my head round the new scale of things – tanking around little islands looking for bright green spots of marshals. We completed whole lot in about 75 minutes then I came in to tag 4 bikes (points, points points!) to head off to ferry while I chased them in bus. Lovely drive around and impressive seeing our “peloton” of bikers working the hills on the way to Berneray causeway. Got there just ahead of them to unload kayak and wait for Sound crossing while rest of team drove across causeway to new ferry terminal to catch ferry. Again we set off soon after ferry left – I was in second wave this time, overtook Moira and others quite soon but then had no-one to follow and managed to head rather further out towards St Kilda than intended! Heading for gap between Ensay and Killegray (I thought) but realised when I saw James and Callum race past me about 500m to east that I hadn’t got quite right route! Amazing conditions again – swell but calm across Sound. Weird currents and rivers of flow in middle of sea through gap between two islands and across to Leverburgh. Good fun, nothing scary. Hard work and seemed a long slog into Leverburgh to tag bikers to head off along yellow coast road up east side of South Harris.   Jumped in bus with Linda and Pyro to be ferried up to Horgabost beach on north coast of South Harris directly opposite Taransay. L and P off with bus to get themselves in position for tags from H and G after they had done wiggly road bike and run route up east coast. Pyro mt biking (one of the big ones – round via Reinigeadal to Scalpay) and Linda doing a couple of big peaks running north to Tarbert (lower peak on Uabhal Mor and Ceann Reamhar). Beautiful day (again!) – lay in sun eating, sorting out kit (paddle in running gear this time to do sprint up Beinn Ra on arrival on Taransay), drying clothes, chatting to other kayakers until safety boats appeared. Then a mass start sprint to Taransay – just over 3km, one of shortest race legs, good to be able to see where we were heading all way across and still be able to see James and Callum all the way too! Arrived on beach in fourth place, set off up hill, lovely running to start then hard slog on heather and peat and rocks, lovely run back down for clock to stop on beach. Overtaken by Andy and Tim on run and overtook one person so ended up fifth – pretty chuffed! For once remembered camera and even took a quick “time-out” at the trig point to take panoramic shots of views of top of Taransay – St Kilda etc. out to sea; fabulous views of North Harris hills and beaches to east. Hot sun, blue skies – who needs forecasts! Passed by James (being rapidly overtaken by Callum!!), Andy and Tim on their way back down to beach (I was still on the way up!) – headed back down to join them and went into sea for a glorious swim. Then an interminable “cruise” back to Tarbert. Really tough – took about 2 hours and I was struggling to stay awake! Beautiful, lovely views of cliffs and beaches and seabirds but very hard neither racing nor dawdling. Bum screaming, just wanted to stop! Big relief to get to end of Loch A Siar (West Loch Tarbert??) and finally find grassy patch near school to leave boats. Couple of team buses then delivered us all back to Scalpay for famous fish pie and other goodies.   Meanwhile, having completed road bike/ run (H and G), hill runs (L), H and G had done road bike along swoopy hilly coast road to Scalpay and together with L then done bike/ run round Scalpay itself (including their encounter with Fred Macaulay’s Dad’s cousin and his gift of shortbread).  All met up at Hall – for usual: food, more food, planning, briefing, massages and bed!  Go to  urlLink Day 4 .

       Tuesday : another fairly wet and wild night and this time we had to be up and packing up wet tents at 5.30AM. Drive round to Ard Mhor for kayakers to get ready (Nonie today) and rest of teams in ferry queue by 06.45. Ferry set off first, kayakers soon after. We were set off in reverse order of times from day before – they weren’t sure where to put me as I hadn’t paddled day before so I was set off with Moira from All Over the Place. We were allowed to paddle straight across the Sound and I could almost see the ferry terminal on far side (Eriskay) from the off. Fabulous paddle – almost flat calm, glassy seas, quite a swell in the middle but still possible to paddle almost as if on flat water and not worry too much about staying stable. Shoals of auks – guillemots, black guillemots, lots of razorbills, flighting around and on the water. Chased the ferry across, watched it go out of sight round sea wall and then 20 minutes later, the return ferry coming out towards me. Not sure what to do, headed left as I thought the ferry might have to take same coast-hugging route it had on way across. Ferry headed right towards me so I paddled faster, keeping left and eventually ferry gave up and we passed left to left (probably I was meant to go right and pass right to right?). Feeling strong and came in ahead of the field – good feeling with all the teams waiting to be tagged by their incoming kayak. Set Gordon off in the lead on bike across causeway from Eriskay to South Uist.  I ended up third equal time on that leg – pretty chuffed, beaten only by James Block and Callum Urquhart – nice boat!!  Meanwhile, G raced on road bike across causeway, up to a checkpoint on south side Loch Baghasdail and then to tag mt bikers (L and P) to set off on a S Uist machair ride and H on a run over Triurebheinn, Stulaval and Trinival to the east of the machair. We got kayak loaded and jumped in bus to take L, P and H to their respective start points. I collected G after he tagged H (slight hiatus when my brain stopped and we missed turn off while G was tanking up behind us on bike!). Drove north up main red road (spinal route) to another check point to await incoming bikers (L and P). Glorious weather again – stripped off kayak gear, hung clothes all over bus and ground to dry. Eating, rehydrating etc. G resting before big Beinn Mhor run.  L and P (and lots of other teams) came tanking in on mt bikes. I then set off on road bike – back down red road and on to side road to meet H coming off her run. Scooter on my back in a rucksack to help H out.  Lovely ride down shores of Loch Eynort and then sat in the sun watching various runners come in off the hill and chatting to Gordon from Heb Hash House Harriers also waiting for his team runner. H arrived and I tagged her and set off racing back on road bike to tag G at bus to set off up Beinn Mhor. We decided to ditch the next stage (swim across causeway at Loch Bee) so as not to miss kayak leg later in day. (In fact, looking back, we could probably have managed both if we’d had swim set up, with H and me in place in advance of G coming down off Beinn Mhor – but it’s hard to judge these things when none of us is a good enough hill runner to judge our finish times at all accurately). G was pretty quick in fact – he came in, tagged P again for another mt bike machair section, then rest of us with bus moved up to end of swim causeway. P came in, then went out straight away again with L and H for long road bike section (P on mt bike!!). This road section took them up on to N Uist, followed by a run across the bog to bag Eaval and Burrival (G, H and P). This meant mad Pyro doing 3 hard sections in a row – mt bike, road bike, run – nutter but then he does have 20 years on the rest of his team! L then met them with bus at end of run to do road bike along Loch Euphort and final tag to G to go up last checkpoint and bike in to Carinish Hall for end of day.   Meanwhile, G took bus, kayak and me up to Grimsay for start of next kayak section. Managed to get that bit wrong – meant to drive anti-clockwise round Grimsay and I forgot and thought we were to go clockwise – result was I saw Catriona and Mike’s croft though, which was nice! To Kallin to pier to launch kayaks. Long, lovely cruise paddle around Ronay, out to sea and up main east coast of North Uist. Some swell but again almost windless, calm, sunny and beautiful. Sea like molten chocolate. Rainbow out to sea. Sociable, chatting, RHIBs chugging alongside. Up off Floddaybeg and we regrouped to be set off racing again in reverse order of day before times, Moira and me at the front. Tough paddle up the coast, quite hard to read coastline, so I was very glad when James and Callum overtook me and could let them work out how to spot the very narrow entrance to Loch Euphort into which we had to turn (saw James ahead disappear a couple of times up blind “inlets” – and then re-appear!).  Beautiful moment when porpoises suddenly appeared about half a km ahead and we were able to paddle up right through the middle with them porpoising and playing around us (12 or 15 including at least one tiny one). Saw some runners coming down off Eaval to our west, lovely evening sun. Slog up Euphort – paddles slapping and slurping off unpleasant concentrations of large jellyfish all around. Anthony and Matt finally reeled me in on the long haul (oh so long) up the Loch and I ended up fifth on that leg – very good to finish, in a light refreshing rain shower, and see team there waiting to help with kayak onto roof and back to hall to find Gordon and food and massages awaiting.   Go to  urlLink Day 3 .

       Monday :  relaxed and fun start to the race. We’d agreed that Pyro would do Day 1 paddling so that left me having to run around a lot! First stage was to drive along to southern end Vatersay Bay, then a Le Mans style start to the whole event with team carrying kayak and running across to Bagh á Deas to launch Pyro and the boat off on a paddle back round the headland to Vatersay beach to escort swimmer (Gordon) in a swim parallel to and south along the beach to tag runners (Heather, Linda, me) to set off on a tour of the (low) peaks of Vatersay (Am Meall, unnamed and Beinn Ruilibreac). Good fun – I felt slow and we were passed by a few teams but I kept reminding myself that times weren’t too critical – putting three  runners out on this section meant a good start to the points-gathering which is an essential part of completing a Heb. Best memory of that leg – running up a potato field behind Friends of Ghengis runner and then freeing his foot when he got stuck trying to clear a barbed wire fence. Slog along dunes almost back to campsite to hand over to Gordon and Heather for next running leg and start to scrutinise the rules and map for that afternoon’s mystery stage (only handed out after starting portage). H and G off to bag Theiseabhal Beag and Theiseabhal Mor on Vatersay while N and L took van round to causeway on to Barra.  Meanwhile, Pyro in kayak had a race paddle round to Castlebay (where they stopped for LUNCH!!) then later a long (16k?) paddle right round east of Barra up to Ard Mhor (new ferry terminal).   H and G came spanking across causeway to tag L and me and we set off up a steep scramble to find checkpoint on shoulder of Beinn Tangabhal on Barra, followed by a yomp across the moor to another checkpoint in a Dun (burial mound) on the northern coast of that part of Barra. Good fun – we felt slow but steady – found both checkpoints and made good time back along the coast to the bus and G and H waiting for us at Tangasdal (place we camped at end of event last year). Nervous point at end when we thought we’d ended up wrong side of a large lagoon but we found a way across without getting immersed and it was great to run up to the familiar grassy flower field of 13 months earlier. Also very satisfying to meet other teams who had gone faster but failed to find our 2 checkpoints.   Then began the free stage – get as many marked checkpoints as you can in any order with 4 people and two bikes in any chosen combination (including meeting and swapping partners/ bikes if desired). We opted for simplicity – H and G as faster runners set off on bikes to do all furthest distant checkpoints while L and I did the 3 closest but highest ones. This involved L and me scootering through Castlebay to save our running legs, out the other side, dump scooters in an overgrown ditch and then leg it up Sheabhal (383m) and Grianan (295m), picking up another checkpoint on way back down to Borgh and Tangasdal. It wasn’t exactly running but we scrambled up Sheabhal, on hands and knees at times (I can see how Iain managed to get out of control on way down last year), past the white statue of Madonna and child to the check point on top. Brief stop to put on waterproofs – we could see heavy dark clouds and rain piling in off the sea to the west and I hoped it wasn’t getting squally and rough for Pyro out to the east of Barra. Fabulous views – couldn’t believe I hadn’t taken a camera with us. Off the back of Sheabhal and Grianan, back down to road and slogged along towards Tangasdal picking up another check point on the way. Then out to a fourth by the Burial Ground north of Tangasdal – leaving a red hat on a fence post at the start of the track as we came out to let H and G know we were ahead of them and had done that last checkpoint. It was only on the way down from that run that I realised we should have ditched one or two of the furthest check points – with only a 25 minute penalty we would almost certainly have ended up with a quicker time by taking the penalty and missing some of the furthest away ones. L and I jogged in to the finish of the day (H and G time would count as they were behind us) and Pyro was there waiting having got a lift back with a faster team. H and G arrived soon after – very relieved to have found the red hat in place which saved them going for the last check point. They had had more gruelling afternoon – running across various unsuitable bits of terrain in bike shoes with cleats on. Quick diversion to Castlebay for very welcome showers in the school, collect scooters from ditch and back to Vatersay for a sumptuous meal (laid tables, flowers and candles), briefing, planning and bed.  Go to  urlLink Day 2 .

      Hmm…. Where to start. Another glass of wine. My second Heb and very different from the first. Not quite as nerve-wracking and awe-inspiring but fabulous nonetheless.    Saturday : arrived on Barra after a pretty unpleasant and heaving ferry crossing (about a 6-er on the Rob-throw-up gauge). Linda suffered despite her pills; I headed for the loo just to be safe and fell asleep in the shower when I found the loo occupied. Meanwhile, Bill was away down the road to Norfolk via York with Heather, George and Biffo to visit families and have parties. Week before was strange – packing for Bill and the kids, sorting out Heb gear, wrestling with software and maps, trying not to train too much.     Also strange arriving in Castlebay – scene of some of the most intense emotions of our race the year before – Iain injured storming down off Sheaval, last leg out to Kisimul Castle and feelings of euphoria at completing the event – and now here we were arriving at another beginning.  Drove across to Vatersay to camp on the dunes behind Vatersay beach. Fabulous location, great northern divers, auks, otters and seals in the bay.  Calm blue water, endless beach and soft sand to pitch tents in.    Sunday : spent the day missing Bill and the kids and pottering around with gear. Pyro had a go in the lovely new red Inuk (and fortunately liked it); planning sessions with maps and coloured pens and flip charts and lots of scribbling. Kit checks, bike fixing, registration etc. Meeting familiar faces from last year and getting to know new ones. Early-ish bed and torrential rain and winds all night – not a good sleep despite relatively late start and long lie Mon AM.
