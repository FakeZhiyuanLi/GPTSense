						   On December. 15,  the People's Republic of China commenced a series of press releases on "Uygur Terrorism" in which they "publicly" and for the "first time" identified Uygur organisations and individuals that they claim to be terrorists.   The Uygur are a Turkic/Muslim ethnic group numbering some 7 million who live mainly in the economically and strategically important north western border region known as Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.   A Caucasian race and speaking the Turkic language the Uygur have long harbored sentiments of independence and there were several isolated incidences of violence perpetrated in the 1990s by individuals or small groups claiming to represent the cause. More realistically today the Uygur generally seek nothing more than greater autonomy and cultural integrity within the PRC  The Chinese have repeatedly claimed that there existed several well organised and active "separatist/ terrorist" organisations whose objective is independence from China and the establishment of the independent state of  East Turkestan .   They have attributed some 400 terrorist acts to these groups which they claim have resulted in 200 deaths and 400 injured since 1990.   On the basis of this "organised" and "ongoing" terrorist activity the PRC has very heavily cracked down on any form of dissent, rights of association, free speech and religious freedom. Amnesty International, among other groups and commentators, has claimed numerous incidences of unlawful detention, prison sentences and even executions in the name of the  "War on Terrorism" .  It is also claimed, by some who are knowledgeable in the "Uygur Question", that like some other states in Central Asia and elsewhere, China have used the events of  "9/11"  and the subsequent "War on Terrorism" to mask an ongoing and meditated attacks on this ethnic group. By bringing their policies toward the Uygur under the banner of The "War" they have been successful in achieving their objectives without international scrutiny, and further, in fact, the likes of the US have turned a "blind eye" to these activities as a trade off for Chinese support.  Among the organisations listed in these series of press releases was the " East Turkestan Islamic Movement " a little known group who had been listed in 2002 as an internationally recognised terrorist organisation by the UN as a result of lobbying by China and supported by the United States.  The press releases claimed the leader of this so called terrorist group was one  Hassan Mahsun an Uygur living in exile who, it was further claimed, had strong ties to  Al Qaida  and had masterminded, among other things, several bomb attacks within China. These claims had been refuted by Mahsun in several prior interviews.  These were the events of December 15 2003.   On December 23 2003 it was reported by the  urlLink BBC  that Mahsun was killed in October 2003 by Pakistani soldiers in a raid on a suspected Al Qaida hideout in South Waziristan, Pakistan. It was further reported that the Chinese Government were involved in making positive identification of the body through DNA testing.  On the same day as the BBC report the Chinese newspaper  Xinhua  ran a similar story. Later that day Xinhua edited out all links to the story claiming it had been withdrawn because of it's "sensitive nature".  urlLink (Yahoo News)  How then does the PRC release fairly significant press statements identifying the virtual "Bin Laden" of Uygur terrorists groups when they supposedly actively participated in the identification of his body in October? Why was the Xinhua article cut?  It would seem that these events give strong credence to the arguments that the PRC is waging a calculated and pre-meditated campaign against the Uygur. At the very least it raises some very serious questions.  How could this happen? Perhaps because the press release was written well in advance and set for release at a particular opportune time?   Does the cutting of the Xinhua article prove that the PRC recognises it's fairly significant mistake?   Does the fact that this mistake was allowed to occur at all prove that the case for the existence of Uygur terrorism argued by the PRC is not taken seriously enough, even by them, to the point that the death of China's "Bin Laden" is of so little consequence?  These questions raise very serious doubts about the Chinese claims as to the existence of Uygur terrorist groups and in doing so suggests that the Chinese "War on Terorism" is in fact a war on the Uygur and their human rights.  It also casts serious doubts on the US's and other countries' foreign policy towards China ( and other countries for that matter) in respect of  human rights violations in the name of the "War on Terrorism".  In pursuit of the objectives embodied in the "War on Terrorism" are we "throwing the baby out with the bath water"?

						   The People's Republic of China on December 15  released a series of statements concerning the Uygur ethnic minority of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region of China.(People's Daily News Agency)  They identified what they say are Uygur terrorist groups and leaders.  Whilst all commentators acknowledge that there have been incidents of violence carried out in the name of Uygur independence there has been no solid evidence supplied by China or the US that there does exist organised "Uygur terrorist groups"  I mention the US because in September 2002 they supported China's request to have a little known Uygur Independence organisation (ETIM) proscribed as a recognised terrorist group. This was done, no doubt, to assuage the Chinese over US involvement in countries on the their doorstep.  Under the guise of being a global supporter of the "War on Terrorism" and with the tacit "support" of the US, the Chinese have continued a systematic attack on lawful dissent, religion, rights of association and freedom of speech among the Uygur peoples.  This has involved detention, imprisonment and reportedly even execution.  Yes, the "War on terrorism" so bravely lead by the people of the free world and the US in particular does have it's downsides, not only for the Uygur but also other Turkic/Muslim peoples in Central Asia.  We can not lose site of the "smaller picture" and turn our heads away from the gross misuse of a valid policy by a small group of Central Asian nations and China. We must fight terrorism yes but, we can not sacrifice the human rights of thousands (maybe millions)  of people to get one man. What is that old saying? "It is better that a thousand criminals go free than one innocent man condemned". The analogy must work in the "War on terrorism" as well.  The double standard is that the US and other countries were once  very serious critics of Beijing's treatment of the Uygur ethnic minority. Cases of human rights violations elicited quick and vocal criticism from the US and rightly so. However, with the advent of "9/11"  the US and her allies have gone soft on China with regards to Human rights. That is not to say that they and the US in particular has been silent but they have lost the sense of urgency and have watered down their diplomatic responses to such incidents.  China obviously recognises this and is exploiting it. Therefore, any actions they take against the Uygur they claim it is against terrorist elements and mask it by calling it the "War on Terrorism" and as such the world looks the other way.   The US  is obviously grateful  for China's support in the "War" especially as to how quietly and magnanimously China has accepted US troops only a stone 's throw away, but, this gratitude does present them with a major policy dilema. "How much trade off do we allow?"  And this is a moral/philosophical question as well as a political one. On one hand the Turkic Republics of Central Asia (the ex Soviet Republics) and China are supporting the war on terrorism, the former allowing bases and US military personnel in their countries, and the second providing at least moral support. On the other hand the US and others, are turning a blind eye to the excesses and violations of Human rights being acted out in these countries in the name of the "War on Terorism".  Let us achieve the objectives of the "War on Terrorism" but in doing so not ignore and by doing so condone lesser evils for the sake of it.  Let us not chuck the baby out with the bathwater!

						   Feel free to email your comments  In his article  Ethnic Conflict Prevention in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region: New Models for China's New Region” author Dru Gladney ( Professor of Asian Studies and Anthropology at the University of Hawaii.) makes some glaringly naive assertions about the political and social situation in Xinjiang China as it concerns primarily the Uygur people.   The article attempts to analyse the ethnic situation with particular attention to the Uygur majority whom in his words he describes as the “restive Uygurs” He then goes on to offer models that are available to the Chinese to alleviate and prevent rising ethnic tension and violence.   The good professor shows a very shallow understanding of the situation as it concerns the Uygur both in Xinjiang and in diaspora.   Firstly as to his assertion that the Uygur are “restive”. It would depend I suppose on the definition of the term “restive” which in my mind means intractable or resistant of control. It can also mean fidgety due to lack of rest. If it is the former this has negative connotations for those unfamiliar with the situation, that is, that the Uygurs, as a whole, are actively and even violently resisting the Han Chinese and PRC Central Government. This assertion is patently incorrect and will mislead readers as to the mindset of the Uygur people.   The Uygurs as a whole are not intractable nor restive in the sense the article implies. A casual observer would take away from the article the feeling that the Uygur are on the verge of mass rebellion, waiting for a banner to follow to rise up in violence and bloodshed. Yes, they resent Han immigration into Xinjiang but no more or less than any peoples who for 2,000 years have enjoyed pre-eminence culturally and numerically in their native land. Are the European Americans not “restive” over Hispanics are the Australians not “restive” over Asian immigration? And the latter two have not experienced going from a 74% majority to a 49% minority in 50 odd years despite doubling their own population.   These are figures that no one who has not experienced such rapidity of change can comprehend. Of course there are grumblings and resentment, that is only natural. Yes, some actively shun association with Han Chinese to the point of refusing to get into a taxi with a Han Chinese driver. These are just the same little “protests” carried out by millions of people around the world daily. Yes, they resent the apparent economic disparities between Han and Uygur but they are not in absolute terms worse off, they are relatively worse off, there is a difference.   The author mentions the lower levels of literacy and the lower life expectancy and other social/welfare indicators of Uygur people lag behind compared to the Han. Again this is misleading at least in context. He fails to mention that yes whilst this is true the situation with all social/economic and welfare has improved markedly since 1949.   He then goes on to paint a picture of a growing, vocal and well organised international campaign on behalf of the Uygurs particularly on the Internet. He ventures a figure of some 25 active organisations and states the cities they operate from. Impressive? The facts are quite different. He mentions active operations in Australia and Melbourne in particular. I run three websites in Australia concerning the Uygur and Turkic peoples of Central Asia. One is a group I started in the naive belief that I could help new Uygur arrivals to this country. I have not once been contacted in any shape or form from any Uygur Organisation in Australia nor have I run across any Australian website other than my own despite countless hours of research. As for other organisations growing and becoming more vocal and organised the good professor must never have gone to Google and searched on the term Uygur. You have the Uyghur American Association which is still active but much less so than several years ago. Uyghur UK Association is out of date. East Turkestan National Conference hardly a hive of activity, East Turkestan National Freedom centre Washington – gone, Taklamakan.org, East Turkestan Information Centre, Uygur.Org all either one, inert or but shells of old information. As well, the activity in the Uygur discussion groups, even Uygur language ones, have few posts. Essentially the Uygur internet/cyberspace campaign that he speaks of peaked in 1999 and has been in rapid decline ever since. In one of my articles I call the Uygur Natioanlist websites the “rotting hulks of the Uygur Independence Movement.    The professor then goes on to propose several models to relieve ethnic tension in Xinjiang, to wit the Alaskan, Hawaiian, Australian, Scotland and West Bank models (the last one obviously for some scare mongering). It is incredible to believe that an expert could put forward the raft of models he has. His Alaskan, Hawaiian and Australian models relate to indigenous peoples whose histories cultures and circumstances are in no way analogous to the Uygur situation.   The Australian aborigine at the time of European arrival were a semi nomadic stone age culture, the Innuits and Hawaiians were also not that greatly advanced on the Aborigine at the time of the arrival of their European colonists. These peoples were deprived of their very existence not necessarily through violence but through deprivation of the homelands, their traditional livelihoods. Their ability to thrive and prosper and to live the lifestyle they had been used to had been irrevocably taken away from them by a foreign culture. This is not so with the Uygur.   The Uygur are an established civilised people by world standards. They once ran a great empire. Their legacy to the world in arts, culture, governance, trade and other areas is great and goes back at least to the 8th century.   They are not a peoples whose way of life was totally robbed by a strange and foreign culture. They still trade and conduct business much as they have done for 2,000 years. They still farm, they go to mosques they dance the Dolan, they still write. In other words they still continue, essentially, the culture they have been developing back from the 8th century. The difference is now they have cultural and economic competition in their land.   But this competition is not unknown to them, it is not a strange and foreign culture to them. The Uygurs have fought with and against the Han Chinese since 100 BCE. They have been dominated and subjugated by them for centuries and at one time even considered invading them much as the Mongols later did. They have traded with them, they even were a major player in the introduction of Buddhism.   This is in no way similar to the Aborigines, Innuits or Hawaiians. The Uygur do not want welfare, handouts or thousands of acres of barren land. They want to maintain their cultural integrity and to play a significant part (and not necessarily the only part) in the government and future of their homeland and to maintain within reason their cultural identity.   The professor also puts forward the Scottish model and rightly so, but, for two reasons. Firstly, when the Scottish model was introduced the Scottish people were far and away the majority ethnic group in Scotland and remain so to this day. In Xinjiang, however, some observers now believe that the Uygur do not even have parity with the Han let alone when the other ethnic groups are factored in. Even if a moratorium on migration to Xinjiang were put in place today they would never regain their majority status.   The second consideration is that Scotland economically has not and does not have the attraction of Xinjiang in terms of under developed resources and economic opportunity nor did it have the strategic importance. No Englishman particularly cared if the Scottish had a degree of autonomy because no one wanted to go there. That is not being facetious that is just the facts from an economic viewpoint.   No, the Scottish model on the surface looks appealing but could not operate in the manner the Professor envisages, maybe if it had been implemented in 1949 but not now. The professor is leading from an assumption that the Uygur have some right to “own” Xinjiang. That may have been true but they are now dispossessed. And they unfortunately will never have that right again.   The last model, the West Bank model, is ludicrous at best and scare mongering at worst   Yes, once again there are some superficial similarities in the two scenarios but a little investigation and analysis would reveal to any reasonable person that a West Bank scenario would never occur in Xinjiang.   The professor essentially implies a scenario where al qaeda or the Taliban will strike a banner and a disillusioned Uygur people will rise beneath it resulting in a Central Asia “West Bank”.   Firstly, the Uygur are not and have never been Islamic fundamentalists. Their brand of Islam bears no similarities to that of the Taliban or al qaeda in fact it is highly secular. Secondly, they are a Turkic people not an Arabic people as the other two are. Thirdly, even at the height of the Taliban, even with the catalyst effect one would expect from the decline of the Soviet Union and the setting up of the Turkic Republics, even given their physical proximity to Afghanistan there still have been no conclusive linkages of any great import between them. Yes those organisations trained some militant Uygurs (1,000 odd were rounded up in Afghanistan) yes they may have supplied some minor economic support to a minuscule minority but given the foregoing it is obvious that the majority of Uygurs have no truck with these organisations. As the professor rightly points out the Uygur people, as a whole, have not resorted to, or supported, the use of violence and terrorist activities to achieve an end. So what would change in the foreseeable future. If they were ever going to do it then between 1991 and “September 11” would have been the time but they did not. This analogy quite frankly, like a lot of so called “informed comment” on the Uygur situation, is facile.   Something needs to be done in Xinjiang that is without question. The Uygur are the descendants of the original owners. As to their rights to ownership today that is one only Solomon could decide. But it this very question of ownership that is muddying the waters and blocking the way forward. Ownership implies restitution or compensation a trap the professor falls into with some of his models and one that quite a lot of people fall into.   Should the goal of the Uygur be restitution? Do we wave a wand and move out the Han en masse some who now are second and third generation themselves? Do we write a blank cheque or dismantle the Han supplied infrastructure and ship it back to them on the railroad they built and return on Donkeys.   Should it be monetary compensation for the “stolen land”? How hard to implement an Australian or Alaskan model with 8 –10 million Uygurs (1 million in diaspora who have been away from their homeland for up to 40 years)?   Or, do we accept the situation and strive to develop a model where the Uygur can retain and re invigorate their unique culture? Where they are educated and trained to do the jobs the Han are now doing so they can participate fully in the development of Xinjiang and the resultant economic flow on. A model where they are assured rights at least equal to Han Chinese.   If pre 1949 was a good time to do something, if 1991 to “September 11” was an opportune time to do something than perhaps, with the Olympics and the opening up of China, now is a good time to do something.   Let us not allow journalists looking for a sensation beat up some Kashgar taxi drivers comments or ill informed “experts” looking for publication or the Uygurs in diaspora, who do like the Europeans in exile post 1945 did when they sat in foreign lands and plotted the downfall of the Soviet Union, to dictate or drive the future of Xinjiang. Let it be the Xinjiang Uygur and the Han, each giving up something small to gain something large.    Stephen Sullivan  Sydney Australia

						    urlLink uighur-l NEWSPAPER SLUR ANGERS UIGHURS    The Uygur people of Xinjiang China are in really a very unenviable position.  They do not wear saffron robes and are not Buddhists (or at least not any more) so they do not attract the attention of the Richrd Gere's of the world as the Tibetans do. Somehow after "9/11" being Muslim does not elicit a lot of world sympathy.  They live under a regime whose censorship laws are so harsh that you could be imprisoned ( and possibly worse) for handing out leaflets that are anyway negative of the state. So, they can not effectively get the message of their plight to the outside world.  They live in a country that is on the verge of an economic boom that has all the capitalists "free" nations around the world almost salivating to get a part of the bone and willing to bury any scruples or ignore any "minor issues" of human right abuse in doing so.  But the Uygur are a Turkic people and until fairly recently that meant something important to them. They had a worldwide brotherhood of "kinsmen" stretching from the Central Asian plateaus through to the Caucuses and to Turkey. Among these "brothers" they sought solace, moral support and inspiration. In many instances their lives where saved by being able to step across the borders. Generations of Uygur intelligensia have looked to Turkey for inspiration as leaders and supporters.  As the article cited above attests this is no longer the case. Where once they sought a shoulder now the Uygur may face a fist. Where once they may have sought sancturary more than likely now they will be mached back to the borders and forcibly repatriated no matter what their possible fate. Where once in Turkey they had parks named after their nationalist leaders now the Uygur organisations in diaspora are refused the right to hold peaceful international meetings.  This then is the reality of Central Asian and Turkish politics today where "brothers" can be ignored.   Is it because the Uygurs are international terrorists, a threat to regional peace and safety? No it is no more than a desire by these nations to curry favour with the Chinese. The Central Asian states, predominantly run by near  despots who came up from the ranks of the old Soviet regime, see the wealth of opportunity of being seen to be supportive of Beijing. Trade deals, billions in potential investment and 1 plus billion potential consumers can do a lot to turn a fellows head. Being less than vocal in supporting the Uygur is a small investment indeed.   The "Great Game" of the 19th and early 20th centuries that was played out between Russia and Britain over Central Asia and northwestern China is back on and being joined by the likes of the United States, China, India and some European countries including Turkey. Each is trying for an economic and/or military presence. The Central Asians are falling over themselves in accomodation, hedging bets all for the almighty dollar, yuan or ruble.  The article cited reports how a Kazakhstan newspaper essentially branded the 200,000 plus Uygurs living in Kazakhstan as terrorists and trouble makers. This is not a new story though it has not been as publicly stated before. In Uzbekistan there has been rumblings against the Uygur residents there for some time. The publication of the article mentioned does however mark an important turning point for the Uygur.  Whilst the Kazakhstan Interior Minister distances his government from the opinions expressed one can not help thinking back to the early rumblings against another ethnic group. Not that one expects a "final solution" to the Uygur question but the outcome could be less than pleasent for the Uygur of Xinjiang and Cental Asia generally if they remain friendless in the world.    The Uygur truely are in an unenviable position. Alone in the world, championed by no one and now sold out by their brothers for 12 pieces of silver. It is hoped that they are happy with the money and do not want to take a part in the execution.

						      Uygur Detainees at Guantanono     urlLink Terrorism & Security | csmonitor.com   Whilst I am a great supporter of a "War on Terrorism" I am getting increasingly concerned about certain aspects of it's prosecution.   I have argued extensively that China's contribution to the "War" for example is little more than a mask for it's continued suppression of their  Muslim minority, particularly the Uygur of Xinjiang. I have also alluded to the feeling that I am getting that the "War" is being used increasingly as a political tool and that the hunting down of Taliban "stragglers" does not constitute an attack against the core of Terrorism.  Having just read the above article I am becoming more frustrated.   It has been a considerable period of time since the inmates of Guantanomo were incarcerated. We know little about them. We do not know if they are high ranking "terrorists" or just "foot soldiers" caught up in the culture of the Taliban. There are now questions being raised as to the process under which they will be tried.  It was of particular concern to me to learn through this article that there are apparently children among the incarcerated who must have been as young as 15 or 16 at the time of their capture. No one will argue that someone so young can be guilty of terrorist acts but surely fairness would require that their age be taken into consideration in all areas of their handling and processing. If they were not terrorists when they went in they will be definite candidates when they come out.  Among the detainees apparently are three Uygurs (the Uygurs are a Muslim ethnic minority from Xinjiang a north west border region ) and it was mooted recently that they would be returned to China for trial. It is obvious to many commentators, myself included, that such a move would ensure their execution under a Chinese legal system that treats, even the most relatively minor cases of political dissent, as a capital offence, especially if it is perpetrated by an Uygur.   The detainees, firstly, must, as a group, be treated as POWs and accorded the same rights as provided for under the Geneva Convention. There future must be decided sooner rather than later. If there are suspected terrorists among them they must be identified and brought to a speedy trial. If they are to be repatriated they are done so with due consideration to their possible fates.  To defeat something you must be equal to the challenge and you must be better than that which you battle. In the "War on Terrorism" we have done many things that do not make us better than the people we fight.   We have allowed gross human rights violations in the name of the "War" witness China and Uzbekistan, we have brought undue suffering and stigmatization to a world of Muslims. We have allowed indefinite and cruel incarcerations against all our supposed democratic principlesand supported at least de facto very undemocratic regimes.  Let a real "War on Terror" continue but let us not stoop to the level of those we truly must battle.

						       The moral problem that arises out of state run propaganda does so, not as a result of the target audience believing in the veracity of the propaganda, but, when members of that audience do not believe, however choose to act as if they do in furtherance of their own agendas.   A practical problem that arises out of the running of state propaganda, and one that the Nazis had managed effectively, is that for propaganda to be effective the propagandist must be consistent in the untruths and misinformation he propagates. Holes in a boat will eventually sink it.  The People’s Republic of China has, within it’s borders, a relatively little known ethnic minority the Uygur , who live predominantly in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR) in China’s north west border area.  The Uygur are Caucasian, mostly Muslim and speak a Turkic language. The inclusion of the name “Uygur” in the regions title is reflective of the situation in 1955 when the Uygur were by far the largest ethnic group in the region. They currently number some 8.5 million  and up until the early 1960’s lived a fairly insular and relatively politically free existence as a result of Xinjiang’s geographical remoteness and it’s then apparent economic bareness. That situation had existed, despite the fact that they had been nominally ruled by successive Chinese regimes, since 1876. Going back in time the Uygur had been in the 9th CE, rulers a great empire in Central Asia and in the 1940’s had established a short lived independent state of Eastern Turkestan..  Since the early 1960’s, however, things have changed dramatically in Xinjiang. The discovery of rich reserves of natural resources and the increasing strategic importance of the area brought about a PRC policy to populate the region with a resultant inpouring of Han ”migrants”.   The Uygur in a relatively short period of time therefore, have gone from a position of hegemony in 1949 to one of near tenuity now. Their traditional economy has largely been supplanted and their environment has been irrevocably changed.  But the Uygur, to date, has demonstrated a remarkable resilience to these changes. They have refused to be assimilated since the communist takeover as they had refused to be totally subjugated by the Chinese since their first recorded meeting in 63 BCE. They stand out like a sore thumb on the hand of Chinese homogeneity.   From their earliest history the Chinese have pursued an active policy of expansion and assimilation as they moved outwards from the East and the last 53 years under communist rule has been no different. From the early Mao period the PRC has followed an undeclared policy of assimilation of ethnic groups, the Uygur, however, have been less than totally acquiescent to this policy. And, this, the PRC does not like one iota.  Initially, the policies implemented to achieve the PRC’s goal were fairly benign in nature, almost paternal, but, with the failure of the Uygur to comply, the methods have become more overt and much more direct. They have escalated from the novel such as “intermarriage bonuses”, through attempts at religious re-education, to more multi-targeted and concerted plans.  Prior to the riots in Gulja (Yinning) in 1997  the Chinese policies had gone fairly much unnoticed by the outside world but with this event the situation altered considerably.  It is not just coincidence then, that subsequent to the riots in Gulja and the severe government recriminations  that followed and the world attention ensuant, that the word “Terrorist” began to increasingly replace the century old terminology “Separatist” and “Splittist” to describe those seeking independence from China. The term “Separatist”  not having quite the same evil connotations that the term “terrorist” does.   The propaganda machine had been kicked over.  It was put very much into high gear with the events of “9/11”.  Within a month of that date, and before the dust of the Twin Towers had settled, the PRC had commenced an orchestrated propaganda and lobby programme in an attempt to couch their policies within the  terms of the “War on Terror”. In doing so they hoped to mask the actions they deemed necessary to finish the task of breaking the collective will of the Uygur people.  For propaganda to be successful, however, it must be universally believed and, to be believed, it must be themed, it must be constant and it must be consistent in the misinformation it provides. To this end the PRC has  almost  failed miserably.  If it were not for the fact that the PRC’s propaganda is meant to mask serious human rights violations including mass detentions and executions it would be almost comical similar in the vein to the “Keystone Cops”. The PRC has contradicted itself over their facts more times than can be touched on here. These contradictions are not minor, nor are they so deeply hidden that it would require minute investigate analysis to reveal. These are contradictions of purported facts that an average person, with half a day to spare, a computer, access to the Internet and either the CNN’s, BBC’s or People’s Daily archives would easily be able to uncover. Some examples are:  In 1999 it was reported that the head of the XUAR,  Abdul’ahat Abdurxit , had stated that terrorist incidents had died down and had consisted of several bombing and one or two politically motivated assassinations in the previous ten years.  Then we have post “9/11” statements from the PRC claiming over 200 hundred terrorist incidents since 1987 perpetrated by 15 Uygur terrorist organisations and resulting in 163 deaths and 440 injuries.   As recently as December 2003 we had an extraordinary series of events. On the 15th December the PRC, through it’s news organ the People’s Daily, released an item naming for the “first time publicly” Uygur terrorists organisations and their leaders and openly called upon the rest of the world to assist in their capture.  One of those named was the alleged leader of the  East Turkestan Islamic Movement , (ETIM) the only internationally proscribed Uygur terrorist group and considered by the Chinese, supposedly as one would think, public enemy number one.    On the 23rd of the same month the PRC had to provide a statement saying that this Uygur  “Bin Laden” had actually been killed in a raid by the Pakistanis on a rag tag bunch of Al  Qaeda suspects two months prior.  To add insult to injury the Pakistanis claimed that the PRC had aided in his bodies’ identification at the time. Is this the tenor of a nation so in fear of it’s supposed terrorist threat?  The disturbing thing in all this, however, is that despite these and many more glaring anomalies; despite the various Uygur diaspora organisations  tearing apart every Chinese Communique for accuracy; despite the remonstrations of several Human rights organisations such as Amnesty International ; despite the warnings of the UN Human Rights Commission  and, despite the analysis of academic experts, that the world’s leaders continue to appear so “blind” to the propaganda.    When the US State department supported China in the listing of ETIM as a proscribed organisation by the United Nations it released a statement which said, in part, that it had done so based on the facts provided by the PRC and some nebulous news articles printed by Hong Kong and a Russian Newsagencies.   Not only was this fairly weak “evidence” but it came less than a year after a US special envoy on counter terrorism stating that the US did not consider Uygur independence organisations terrorists.   One simple “wink wink, nudge nudge, you scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours’ for whatever reasons, in the name of whatever “greater  good”, had validated and provided endorsement to the PRC’s policy of enforced Sinofication and effectively allowed the PRC greater scope and freedom to complete the task at hand. Without over dramatisation had we not seen this all before in diplomatic relations with pre War Nazi Germany?  Much harm has been caused, human rights have and continue to be to be severely violated, executions have not stopped  all with nary a word of reproach from the “Free World”. The time has come, some two and a half years after the “War on Terrorism” was declared, for the world to step back and re-identify it’s real enemies and then to strike them hard and relentlessly. The war on genuine terror must be pursued vigorously and ultimately be successful.  But, it is also now time to identify those regimes that are using the “War” to mask the furtherance of their ethnic, religious and political agendas and strike them , metaphorically speaking, equally as hard.   It has to be remembered that a terrorist is not only the person on a crowded bus with a bomb. Terrorist states have far greater power and projection than any supposed terrorist generalissimo whose end is dying in the mud of some Pakistani backwater town.    =========================================================== About the Author: Stephen Sullivan is an Australian and amateur “Uygurologist” and author of several articles on the Uygur people.

						    The "Uygur Question" needs resolution. It needs resolution for a variety of reasons.   It is undoubted, despite PRC protestations to the contrary, that the human rights of the Uygur people of Xinjiang are being violated. There are unlawful detentions, there are sham trials and there are even executions. Religious freedom whilst far from being trampled is compromised. Freedom of speech is non existent, fear is pervasive.   The Uygur's unique culture is being eroded at a rapid rate whether intentional consequence of PRC policy or not.   The "Uygur Question" needs resolution from the Han Chinese perspective too. The "Uygur Question" is a constant thorn in it's side domestically and internationally. It drains resources and manpower. It invokes fear, real or otherwise, in it's citizenry as well as within the organs of power. It presents a strategic problem that the Han can do without.  The loss of the Uygur culture will be a loss to the world as well. It will be of no less importance than then the disappearing Amazon rainforests, or Panda habitats or tiger populations, or the many other issues that takes the world's attentions.   Not reaching a solution will see the total destruction of a unique culture that goes back some 2,000 years, the culture of the roots of a tree that has spread it's branches throughout the world and impacted upon it so greatly. These are a people that once ruled a great and mighty empire at the crossroads of great civilisations. The mighty Mongol Khans held them in great esteem and adopted many of their cultural elements, which they then took with them throughout the known world. The Uygur culture is a time capsule.  A solution can be found and there is no better time than the lead up to the Beijing Olympics for the wheels to be put in motion. In fact it may be the last opportunity, for, not for a long time hence, will the PRC be so yearning for world approbation.  The solution, I believe, can be found in the acronym LACIM.   Leadership   The Uygur must raise from it's ranks a leadership group that can crystallise realistic objectives, unify the Uygur people in the attainment of same and be able to negotiate and facilitate change at the highest of levels.   This leadership group and the process of identification and funding must be supported and facilitated by the People's Republic and the international community. Without freedom and support it is unlikely that people of the right calibre will step forward given the PRC's history on dissent and dissidents.  The criteria for membership of this group is that they must be   young   intelligent and educated   worldly and modern   understanding of the needs of the Uygur peoples and other cultures in Xinjiang   cognisant of the culture and psychology of the Han   acceptable by higher Han society and government   acceptable by the greater world    Paradoxically that class of Uygur that is often derided by their fellows, the Han educated, so called "Sinofied Uygurs", provide the best criteria fit.  Many Uygur children are selected by the PRC for special education within the mainstream Han education system. Many are taken to school in Beijing and educated through to university standard, many go on to post graduate study. They are young, well educated, more in touch with the modern world obviously fluent in Chinese and generally in English. They have lived the Han culture and value system and as such they are not only able to successfully negotiate with the Han but will have very real credibility with the greater world generally.  There are also academics, artists, etc away from China who have world experience without any political allegiances that may fit the criteria.  The Uygur in diaspora who run "Uygur Organisations" from the comfort of Europe or the United States have no role to play in this leadership group. Like the post Tzarist Russian emigre class they can offer little and in fact will be a major hindrance to the process if they continue with what the PRC see as "China Bashing". Quite frankly such organisations have done little to further the Uygur cause and with each successive day away from Xinjiang the increasingly less relevant they become. They do not, however, have to be totally cut out of the equation and can, through their myriad of international contacts, provide support and encouragement to this new group and the process they must undertake, however, this will require quite a considerable "sea change" in their posture.  Nor either can the supporters of Pan Turkic or Pan Islamic ideologies play any role. Their ideologies are completely the antithesis to the process that needs to be undertaken. It goes without saying that militant elements of any persuasion need not apply.   Acceptance     Uygur   The new Uygur leadership must sell "acceptance" to the reality that there will be no "Free Eastern Turkestan" or that Xinjiang will become a part of a Pan Turkic or Islamic state or confederation. Not only must the Uygur people "accept" but they must also be seen to "accept" and support the dropping of any claims to independence. This is of vital importance to the process.  They also must accept the fact of the current demographic situation and that this can not be undone.   People's Republic   The PRC must accept the Uygur as an ethnically and cultural diverse peoples and different to the Han Chinese. That, attempts at forced "Sinofication" or cultural assimilation will not only fail and possibly result in bloodshed but, that it is not the result that in the longer term will be in the best national interests of the PRC.   Further, they must accept that in the long term, if a non peaceful resolution of the "Uygur Question" can not be found, then that will adversely effect China's standing in the eyes of the world and impact negatively on all of it's international relations. The "War on Terror" has provided a temporary mask for the "Uygur Question" but this will not always be so.  The PRC given it's recent "New China" policy can actually gain international kudos by it's mature handling of the "Uygur Question" and preserve for future generations a culture that has been so historically important to the Chinese Nation.   Concessions   For the process to commence, let alone succeed, there must be a demonstrative willingness and desire by both parties, Uygur and Chinese, for it's success. This will require both parties providing "concessions" to prove the bona fide’s of their intentions. Mandatory concessions would have to include     Uygur Concessions     An international demonstration by the Uygur that they formally, renounce any claims of Uygur or Islamic sovereignty over Xinjiang. Examples could be by way of Plebiscite or referenda.   Similar demonstrations that they renounce all Pan Turkic and/or Pan Islamic ambitions for themselves and the region.   Publicly disassociate themselves from any organisation  that promotes such ideologies   Demonstrate that they are willing to accept the current demographic make up of Xinjiang and they will not request redress. Further that they will work within it for the good of all Xinjiang's people and China generally.   Demonstrate that they accept that the Chinese language is the main language of Xinjiang in terms at least of higher education, trade, government and employment.   Acceptance of PRC population policies and acknowledge that despite whatever  policies and programmes  are put in place that the Han will eventually become by far the dominant ethnic group in Xinjiang.  Renounce all claims as to financial or material redress, a la the Inuit and the Australian aboriginal scenarios, other than as set out below. That is no land rights claims or claims for compensation.  All Uygur diaspora organisations to review their agendas in support of the process or else publicly be disassociated by the Uygur of Xinjiang.   Concede that Uygurs who have committed criminal or terrorists acts must be made available for judgment by duly constituted courts within the state framework.   That the Uygur ,as part of their willingness to recognise the realities of the current and future demographic situation, offer that the word "Uygur" be omitted from the title of the region     PRC Concessions .   An international demonstration that it accepts the concept of multi culturalism within the Chinese state and particularly as it concerns the Turkic people of Xinjiang. This could be by way of official government statement.   Announce that all policies and legislation currently implemented in Xinjiang will be reviewed by an independent body for purposes of determining the "Sinofication" effect inherent in them and, for them to be amended accordingly.   Announce a moratorium, for a period to be negotiated, on Han migration to Xinjiang.  This moratorium is to remain in effect until other elements of this process have born fruit. Put simply, no Han Chinese can "immigrate" to Xinjiang within the period of the moratorium. Economic, social and employment needs to be met by contract workers or by way of "working visa" arrangements similar to any nation state or by exception through negotiation with the Uygur leadership.   Implement workable "Affirmative Action Policies" to raise the quality of the Uygur  to a level to allow them to compete equally with the Han for employment and business opportunities in all sectors of the economy, including the Public service, and to ensure non discrimination. This will be a determining factor as to the to the length of the moratorium on Han immigration.   Be willing to negotiate long term "Flood controls" on Han immigration to the region and actively encourage the return of Uygurs now in diaspora.   Exempt minorities from family planning legislation as a partial offset to the inevitable growth of the Han population through natural increase and immigration.   Announce the setting up of Minorities Cultural Trusts eg Uygur Cultural Trust. These trusts are to be the beneficiaries of a set percentage of Xinjiang GDP. The purpose of the trusts to be worked out as to the minutiae but include at least  - A trust similar to the National Trust of England   for the preservation of culturally unique buildings, infrastructure and areas of historical and cultural importance. This could include legislation similar to "Sacred Site" legislation in Australia which allows the Aborigines control over access and usage of these areas. For example areas of Kashgar or Turpan could be set aside for the Uygur whereby they have the right to manage business and residential usage.  - Sub Committee for the setting up and management of cultural education system to complement and provide for eventual integration into the Han System  - Sub Committees to govern all other aspects of Uygur and minorities culture eg performing and graphic arts.  Reconstitute the government system so that it can be fully representative of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang  in line with the original "Autonomous" regional model that was so noble in theory and intent but did not work in practice. This would include electoral re-distributions and the avoidance of gerrymandering.   Allow and provide infrastructure for the minorities to educate their children in a manner that will ensure an  cultural grounding whilst preparing the child for full integration into the Han System by late primary or early secondary levels.  Announce amnesty for political dissidents and provide a facility for the peaceable re integration of non- violent dissident groups and individuals without fear of retribution.  Repeal or renounce any legislation or policies limiting or denying freedom of religion, speech and association.   Implementation    Realistic time tables to be negotiated   Regular evaluations of progress   Dispute mechanisms agreed to   Requests for international support both moral and material (eg Foreign training scholarships etc)  Community consultation, involvement and ownership of the process.    Monitoring   The whole process, for reasons of transparency and dispute resolution,  must be oversighted by an independent international body agreed to by both parties.     Conclusion  There can be a solution to the "Uygur Question" that is win/win for both the Uygur and the Chinese.   Additionally, a peaceful resolution can be an important component of the success or otherwise of China's quest for international integration and acceptance.  The process is by no means an easy one or one that can be implemented successfully overnight.   The concessions recommended are not inconsiderable, and, will require enormous goodwill, foresight, political will and courage. As well intensive analysis and planning and a great deal of "marketing" will be required.  But the result will far outweigh the cost and it's achievement does not destroy or unduly compromise the basic wants and needs of each party or their long term goals. Yes, there are, what appears to be, impossible requests for concessions, but if closely analysed they are but small relative to the possible positive outcomes. Of course the party die- hards and the Uygur nationalist organisations will need some heavy convincing.  The summary points of the hoped for outcome are:   The Chinese will be assured that Xinjiang will not become an area of political turbulence and even armed insurgency and, as such, can divert resources to the continued opening up of this strategically and economically vital area. China's national integrity is assured and even bolstered   International kudos will flow to the PRC with contingent goodwill. One thorn will be removed from their side.   Success will greatly lessen the hopes and aspirations of Central Asian terrorist or Islamic fundamentalist groups thus adding to the stability of the region.  International pressure over Taiwan will decrease as the Chinese can demonstrate to the world their reasonableness.  The Uygur will have sufficient control over their cultural and religious integrity and political life to maintain their cultural integrity far into the future.  The Uygur can be raised, through affirmative action programmes, to more fully and equitably participate in the share of the economic benefits of the region thus lessening a major element of potential unrest and increasing economic results for Xinjiang.   The Uygur, not being a small part of the population, have an important economic role to play. By effectively making them partners in Xinjiang's economic results through indexing funding to the GDP the area is assured of their participation.  An economic boom will ultimately ensue, particularly with regards to tourism, which very much untapped at present.   The Uygur if they are supportive as a result of these initiatives are the perfect conduits (as they have been for 2,000 years) for trade to and from the Central Asian Republics.  Fear and violence will be eradicated among the citizens of Xinjiang.    The Uygur Question can be solved it just needs the political will .             ========================================================= Footnote: The Uygur are a Turkic Muslim ethnic minority of China numbering some 7.5m the majority of whom reside in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in China's northwest.

						     urlLink China Study Group     The 2003 socio-economic statistics for China in 2003 are out and show a staggering 9.1% increase in GDP over the previous year with little increase in inflation figures.  What is very interesting to note is the absolutely staggering fuel import figures.  "China last year imported 91.12 million tons of crude oil, up 31.3 percent; 28.24 million tons of oil products, up 38.8 percent; and 37.17 million tons of rolled steel, up 51.8 percent."  At this rate China will become highly dependent on the outside world and as a result increase it's susceptibility to any form of pressure economic or social.  As well, such increasing integration into the world economy can only further assist in the opening up of the channels of communication at all levels which can only be a positive thing.  From a human rights perspective this is good as it will allow foreign governments and organisations increased economic leverage to elicit change.

Even with a reported 30,000 staff attached to the internet censorship department one would have to think that they face an uphill battle and will have to one day just give up!  Here's hoping at least. I have a lot of friends in Xinjiang that have never seen my websites which I have dedicated to them.

						     urlLink United Press International: Analysis: Pressure mounts on China rights     The recent US report on Human Rights in China paints a very damning picture and with good reason  but it is said by some observers that all is not bad. The above link is to an analysis of trends in China's Human Rights and concludes that the question of Human Rights "management" is increasingly being taken out of the hands of the authoritarian government and old hardliners and into the hands of social pressures which erodes the government's stance.   The analysis argues that  freedoms are " burgeoning out of official control " and that the likes of the internet, inbound and outbound tourism and travel, greater involvement in the world economy among other things are enlightening the Chinese people who are now setting the pace of Human Rights Reform  not the PRC government.   The article cites The U.S. annual Country Report on Human Rights Practices in acknowledging "rising urban living standards; greater independence for entrepreneurs; the reform of the public sector ... and expansion of the non-state sector increased workers' employment options and significantly reduced state control over citizens' daily lives."  To quote en block   'Yes, say China supporters, old habits die hard, but the key word in the above quote is "space." Society has become more porous, they argue, and though people do get caught in the nets cast by suspicious and conservative officials, the majority has more freedom than ever before to read, think and discuss, if not to publish their views.  "The social environment is opening up," said a Chinese journalist, who preferred not to be named despite her insistence she enjoys greater freedom of expression than before. "People have more space to live, to breathe, to think, to express themselves. This is the result of the flow of information, from the Internet, from people who have been abroad. There is more exchange with the outside world, and no one can stop it."                              ..they (the PRC) know what is expected.                               -Academic-               The article goes on to quote an academic who has a very unique turn of phrase  " They know what is expected. At least when they are cracking down on people, when they're putting them in prison, when they're shooting people, they do it with a bad conscience. This is a very big difference from the past," she added.   I do not have any doubts that increased interaction with the outside world will have the effect of increasingly taking away from the Chinese government the ability to set the Human Rights reform agenda and timetable.  And I agree with the articles analysis that in their own minds the PRC government feels that they are making great leaps and bounds with Human Rights reform but they just do not yet see things in quite the same way as others do.   What did it used to be called in the Vietnam War days? People Power?

						     urlLink China to issue Human Rights Record of the US     According to the above linked article The Information Office of the State Council of China will issue on March 1 the Human Rights Record of the United States in 2003, in response to the latter's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices which they claim contains "many distortions and denouncements".   This is a diplomatic tit for tat thing and should not really be seen as too important. It certainly does not mean that the PRC government did not take on board what was said in the US  report.

						     urlLink China Study Group      The following is a full reprint of the linked article. If the Chinese can do this so easily to their own Han citizens then, in light of my article yesterday, what are they capable of doing with the Tibetans and the Uygurs?                              ..100,000 families, over 300,000 people have been evicted..                               -Scott Leckie-              "China had evicted 300,000 people from their homes in Beijing to prepare for the 2008 summer Olympics, the Geneva-based Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions (Cohre) said yesterday.  The group said the evictions were part of a global crisis which saw an average of six million people illegally thrown out of their homes every year.   The mayor of Beijing, Wang Qishan, admitted on Saturday that in some cases the demolition of homes and evictions had been conducted illegally.   Scott Leckie, the executive director of Cohre, said: "Large international events including global conferences and sporting events like the Olympic Games are mostly accompanied by forced evictions.    "Nearly 100,000 families, over 300,000 people, have been evicted so far in Beijing, and thousands more evictions are expected." He said Cohre, a non-governmental organisation accredited to the UN in Geneva, was calling on the International Olympic Committee to try to stop the evictions.   It was asking companies to withhold sponsorship to countries hosting the games if they carried out evictions. Cohre had reports that Roma residents in parts of Athens had been evicted ahead of this summer's games. "

						     urlLink Reuters | Breaking News from Around the Globe    Very predictably  China has responded quickly to the release of the U.S. State Departments 2003 Human Rights Report in which it accused the Chinese Government of "backsliding" on human rights during 2003 after positive trends in 2002.  According to a Reuters report (see link) China has responded by criticising the United States  Human Rights Report but significantly stopped short of warning of a setback in ties with Washington.   "China wants to express its strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition,"  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said of the annual U.S. report on human rights around the world, branding its criticism of China as being  "without reason".    "We hope the United States can treat China's progress and achievements on human rights objectively and correctly, and correct its mistaken submission of such reports."   To add further pressure on the Chinese government US Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor  Lorne Craner  told reporters the United States was heading in the direction of a U.N. resolution on China's rights record.  Earlier in the month, China told the United States to " think three times " about introducing a resolution at this year's session of the Geneva-based U.N. Human Rights Commission, which begins its six-week meeting on March 16.  In the past the US has been fairly scathing in it's criticism of China's Human Rights record however with the events of "9/11" and the subsequent moves in Afghanistan and Iraq the Bush Administration had drastically scaled back it's criticism in an attempt to garner Chinese support for it's initiatives in the "War On Terror".  The Uygur being a Muslim people have been particularly ignored during this period as US elected officials, seeing little political capital in supporting Muslims, have virtually ceased any open support.   It will be of interest now to see if the US will follow through by introducing the resolution at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in March   I have said it before and I will say it ad nauseum that with the Beijing Olympics around the corner and China's rush to fully join the world economy that there has never been better times to achieve change within China as it concerns Human Rights. All it needs is the political will of the western "free" world

						    urlLink Asia Times Online - News from greater China; Hong Kong and Taiwan :    Asia Times online has been running a three part series on Tibet and in Part 1 they examine the effects of the forthcoming Beijing Olympics on human rights negotiations concerning Tibet but which would also hold true for the Uygur  " When astronaut Yang Liwei rocketed into space on China's first manned spaceflight, he carried with him the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games banner and China's national flag. Just like the spaceflight, China's award of the Olympic Games represents the coming of age for this growing world superpower.   On this historic flight the Olympic Games logo was flown high. But the Chinese government fears that the banner will be dragged through the dirt by protestors when the games begin. 'Free Tibet' and human rights agitators are gearing up to protest, and the government does not want their glorious sports epic sullied by dissent at home or abroad. "   WE gave Beijing the Olympics and I wonder in doing so did we take into consideration one of the Olympic Ideals  " Olympism is a philosophy of life, exalting and combining in a balanced whole the qualities of body, will and mind. Blending sport with culture and education,  Olympism seeks to create a way of life based on the joy found in effort, the educational value of good example and respect for universal fundamental ethical principles." Olympic Charter, Fundamental Principles, 2."   " Fundamental Ethical Principals " three words that do not describe China's stance on Human Rights.  But the decision is made and provides very real opportunities to elicit change from Beijing.  As the Asia Times article postulates China is fearful that it will lose face in front of the world if the Beijing Olympics is used to highlight their human rights violations.  Now this can go two ways, either they will, over the next four and a bit years, attempt to address their shortcomings in a positive manner or they will employ extreme measures to make sure that the likes of the "Uygur and Tibetan Questions" do not raise (from China's perspective) their "ugly heads" and spoil the show.  If it is the latter you can expect it to quite brutal. A possible scenario is as follows  1. One  to two years out a series of mass detentions will occur of those people within China likely to attempt to cause any disruption. The timing will allow for the ensuing ruckus to die down. 2. Tibet and Xinjiang will be "Locked Down" with travel by Uygurs or Tibetans outside these areas forbidden in the lead up to and during the Olympics. 3. Tibet and Xinjiang will be "locked down" and travel to these areas by foreigners will be denied on the basis of a  jumped up "terrorist threat"  None of these actions are really in the spirit of the Olympics I am sure you will agree.  It is time now, some four years out, that the message be given to the Chinese in no uncertain terms that actions of this type will not be countenanced.  As well the "free"* world must use this run up to the Beijing Olympics to press for change in Beijing policies towards it's ethnic minorities and religious groups.   We have a marvelous opportunity here that should not be squandered. We can, if we do it right, make the Beijing Olympics a celebration of a Brave New World. If we don't we will expose the whole Olympic ideal as a mockery and a sham   * Readers may wonder why I put the word "free" in inverted commas in my posts. Well I do it because the word "Free" should not only denote the condition under which the people in that particularly country live but also their desire for the conditions of all people in the world. How can we be "free" if do not fight for the rights of those who are not. Most times I feel the word "greedy" is more befitting.

						     urlLink GoUpstate.com: An online service of the Spartanburg Herald-Journal      The last of 14 Tibetan "singing nuns" was released Thursday from a Chinese prison, granted a sentence reduction after nearly 15 years behind bars.  Phuntsog Nyidron's sentence was due to run until March 2005, but she was granted an early release.    Phuntsog Nyidron  was arrested at age 22 in 1989 on charges of "counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement" and sentenced to eight years in prison.  In 1993, she and 13 other women became known as the "singing nuns" after they used a tape recorder smuggled into the prison to record songs about their love for their families and their homeland. Their sentences were extended after the tape was smuggled out of the prison.  The linked article states the belief of interested parties that the release came about due to  pressure from the United States and a desire on  China's part to be seen as conciliatory ahead of planned talks between Chinese officials and representatives of the Tibetan Government in exile.  Such "strategic" individual prison releases is a common tactic of the Chinese to gain bargaining power ahead of any negotiations with foreign countries or organisations.   Regardless of the reason thankfully another innocent is free.

						     urlLink BBC NEWS | Business | McDonald's bets on Chinese growth     Fast food outlet McDonald's has said it is planning almost to double its outlets in China ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.   The burger chain has also agreed a fresh eight-year deal to sponsor the games for an unrevealed sum.   "It's an investment we obviously think is worth it for the long term," said McDonald's chairman Jim Cantalupo.   It is a hard question isn't it? The problem of unfettered foreign investment is a conundrum.   On one hand it has positives: shareholder returns, greater involvement of China in global economics, more communication channels opened up, greater prosperity for the Chinese people through employment opportunities etc etc. But on the other hand we can be seen to be giving de facto approval to China's human rights violations and exposing the essential avarice of free societies.  Depending on the school of philosophy you adhere to will provide differing answers to this question.   At one end of the spectrum we have the position that it is morally wrong to be involved at all if even one individual continues to suffer, at the other it would be held that the benefits to humanity as a whole outweigh the negative effect on a relatively small group.   I think that individual organisations must, by and large, have the right to seek economic opportunities as and when they feel fit but be self regulated in doing so. Part of this self regulation would be to prominently display in the likes of any prospectus or annual reports their economic interests in countries that are identified  as human rights violators thus allowing shareholders to make informed decisions. We see examples of this type of self regulation in the so called "green corporations" whose investment strategies must, by self regulation, meet certain predefined environmental characteristics.  I am sure that a great majority of the shareholders of McDonalds for instance have never heard of the Uygur and feel that the Tibet problem, which received such wide exposure in the 70's and 80's but not as much now, had pretty much been resolved.  The government of the corporations principal residence must also have oversight of planned investments with legislation similar to the various "Anti Trust",  "Monopolies" and "Arms sales" legislation where they can veto such plans if the corporation has not exhibited  due diligence or at least demand some human rights concessions from the target country as a pre-requisite for approvals.  Obviously this is not the venue to go into depth but I am sure these things are feasible.   I wonder when shareholders last checked their investments and thought whose blood was on the dividends cheque?

						     urlLink China Legal Reforms Accompanied by "Backsliding" on Human Rights      Well it looks as though the U.S. might be once again hearing the voices in the wilderness concerning China and it's "War on Terror" and other human rights violations.  The  2003 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in China   is officially out.  To cover themselves for not being critical in their last report the U.S Government states that after some positive moves in the right direction in 2002 the Chinese have been guilty of "Backsliding" in 2003.  Let us hope that  this may be the start of some (to use an Australian idiom) "fair dinkum"* pressure not only from the US but all "Free" nations.  * fair dinkum = Honest

						    urlLink Dalai Lama's Envoy Speaks Out.... - www.phayul.com    The Uygur and Tibetan situations are very similar. In reading any story on Tibet or the Uygur you could just swap names and you would not know the difference. The Chinese are consistent if nothing else.   The linked article deals with the Dalai Lama's Special Envoy Lodi Gyari thanking the South African Catholic Bishops' Conference for support of the Tibetan's situation.      Special Envoy Lodi Gyari right of picture     A few of things about this article stood out for me beside the litany of human rights violations that we are so familiar with in the Uygur's situation.  Firstly is the theory he puts forward that China's policy towards the Tibetans (and we can assume the Uygur) is as a direct result of the break up of the Soviet Union.  He believes that through the PRC's analysis as to why the Soviet Union collapsed they came to the conclusion that something similar could happen in China. Further, he believes that they identified religion as being a key determinate in the Soviet's demise.  They conducted this analysis, he postulates, to attempt to avoid a similar fate:    "They did this because they wanted to take pre-emptive measures to prevent the same thing happening to China and Tibet' .   'Their investigators reported that the disintegration of the Soviet communist system largely came about because the people's religion, particularly the Catholic faith, had outlived it. This is the view overall in China, particularly for Tibet'.   The article then goes on to provide facts as to anti-religious policies in Tibet to support this theory.  If one believes that this was an overriding concern why then has this policy really only been used against the Tibetan Buddhists and the Uygur Muslims and to a lesser known extent Christians? Muslims for example in the "Inland" (Eastern China and predominantly Hui)) have very few restrictions placed on them in comparison with the Uygur.  I think that this "religion theory" does go a long way in understanding China's position vis a vis the Uygur and the Tibetans but falls short of a total answer. I have no doubts though that some serious soul searching took place within the ranks of China's politburo in the early 90's.  There are some things that set the Tibetans and the the Uygurs apart from other religious groups in China      They are congregated in particular areas   They are reasonably sizeable   They are in border regions and,   they are ethnically different    I think then that yes religion would have been identified as a potential threat to the regime but it had to be combined with certain other characteristics, namely the above. That is why some religious followers have fared better than others.   The exception of course is the Christians. By some reports they have fared even worse than the Uygurs or the Tibetans but because of their diverse nature their treatment has not come to the the attention of the world to the extent of the former.   I can only conclude that they constituted different types of threats. The Tibetans and Uygurs as separatist threats and the Christians as long term regime threats. Memories of Christian Missionaries must hold fearful connotations.  I would not hesitate to throw in the race/racist angle as well as being a factor in the treatment of the Uygur and Tibetans. I think xenophobia has very much a lot to do with it.  The second very interesting thing about the article was the fate of the  Panchen Lama   who was abducted as a child in 1989 and stands (if he is alive) to succeed the current Dalai Lama.  Having personally come late to the Tibetan's problems I am not totally au fait with this story but am amazed that it has not received far more attention. To use a Christian analolgy  isn't it tantamount to kidnapping the Pope or the Archbishop of Canterbury?  The penultimate point of interest for me was the question of globalisation and the ever  increasing economic involvement of Western nations with the Chinese government.  Mr. Gyari felt it was unfortunate that many Western politicians had ignored religion and religious questions in their dealings with the Chinese. This for me is an understatement. In their quest for the almighty dollar, or whatever currency they have they have not only ignored human rights violations but have effectively condoned them. Never has the time been better to use economic sanctions as a tool to force change on China.  Finally, Mr Gyari spoke of the Chinese leadership and his hopes that the newer crop, being far more worldly then their predecessors, may provide a ray of hope for the Tibetans and by extension the Uygurs.  This is something I too believe and hope for. China by entering the global economy has to move totally away from isolationist and insular type thinking and policies.  I do not think it has happened yet and I feel it may take a generation or two having spoken to younger Han who still are very Red Bookish and very defensive when it comes to such things as ethnic relations, but it has to happen. The Titanic could not turn on a sixpence but maybe a "sixpence" can turn China.  I hope that The Tibetans and the Uygurs are prepared to look longer term and in the meanwhile bide their time to a certain degree.   We have to get our "freedom loving" governments to put a bit of a financial screw on, not to much to turn the Chinese back but enough to allow them to move positively forward

						     urlLink Colin Mackerras Staff Profile     Last evening I had the pleasure to attend a presentation at Sydney University by Professor Colin Mackerras of the Griffith University,  Queensland Australia.  Professor Mackerras is a world respected Asian scholar specialising in China with a particular emphasis on Xinjiang and the Uygur minority.  As well he is a regular visitor to Xinjiang and has recently returned from a three week "field trip" which included visits to Urumqi, Aksu, Hotan Kashgar and Yarkend.   His one hour presentation, followed by a question and answer session, concentrated mainly upon his general impressions as to the changes he has seen in Xinjiang over the period of his many visits.   Some of the Professor's major observations include a perceived  strengthening of Islamicism among the southern Uygur, an easing of Han/Uygur tensions, rapid modernisation, demographic changes and an emerging Uygur middle class.    State of Religion in Xinjiang: Strengthening Islamicism .   The professor's field work on this trip included many interviews with Uygurs and he attempted at every opportunity to speak to Uygur clerics in the cities that he visited.  He came away with the impression that in the south of Xinjiang, particularly Kashgar and Hotan, that there was a strengthening of Islamicism among the Uygur there but this was not reflected in the more Han dominated areas of the north.  Whilst not stating outright, one draws the conclusion from what the professor related in his presentation, that the PRC may be very sensitive to this issue specificly and the situation in Kashgar generally.   In his opinion he  thought he was monitored more closely in Kashgar by State Security then elsewhere in Xinjiang to the point that a planned trip to an Uygur school was vetoed by officials even though he had been allowed fairly open access to such facilities elsewhere. Unfortunately he did not expand on any theory that he may have on reasons for this growing Islamicism                            Strengthening of Islam among the Uygurs in the south..                               -Prof Mackerras-                He noted in the presentation that in speaking to Muslim clerics they seemed very reticent when it came to discussing the general state of Islam in Xinjiang. Whilst they were more than happy to discuss affairs at their particular masjid when it came to the larger picture he was given a stock answer of "speak to the authorities".   As well, and not surprisingly given the the Chinese governments cleric "re-education" programmes, there is little support for Separatism or Islamic extremism among the Uygur clerics.  He was able to confirm that Uygur boys under the age of 18 were not allowed by PRC policy to enter Masjid prayer halls but were able to be in the general environs of the Masjid.   Modernisation and The Economy                             Modernisation has brought benefits to the Uygur..                               -Prof Mackerras-                Professor Mackerras commented at length on the modernisation of Xinjiang that he had witnessed over the period of his visits.   His feeling was that, on balance, modernisation has been  beneficial to the Uygur despite the fact that some older Uygur areas have been demolished.   He cited the leveling of the square in front of the Id Kah masjid as a particular example. Whilst a new square in keeping with the historic and religious significance of the area had been promised by the Han authorities at the time of his visit this was not complete.  He was however critical as to the provision of such infrastructure as running water and health care delivery which he believed could be markedly improved in Xinjiang. He did qualify this by saying that it was a general problem and not one related soley to the Uygur.  Of particular interest to the professor was the rapidly expanding cotton industry in Xinjiang. He thought it possibly a double edged sword, on one hand it had brought increased prosperity to those Uygur involved in the industry but on the other it raised concerns as to the long term effects of the large water requirement on the environment.  With regard to living standards he noted that despite evidence of pockets of poverty  among the Uygur there had been an obvious general increase in ethnic minority prosperity, though, he believed that the rate of wealth accumulation for the Uygur, was nowhere near the level the Han had achieved.   Emerging Uygur Middle Class                             Emerging Uygur middle class..                               -Prof Mackerras-                It is the professors contention that modernisation and economic development in Xinjiang had brought about the emergence of a burgeoning Uygur middle class.  This new Uygur middle class is typified by an acceptance of Han economic and political dominance and permanency in Xinjiang and a desire to better themselves within this environment.   They seek Han education for their children in preference to the Uygur and enjoy the economic benefits and trappings that come with working with the Han. They still however suffer social discrimination at the hands of the Han.   Ethnic Relations   Professor Makerras is of the opinion that ethnic tensions as between the Han and the Uygur have reduced quite markedly in the last several years. He believes that the Chinese "carrot and stick" approach to ethnic relations is having it's effect.  He notes that most tension exists between the Uygur and the newer Han 'migrants" rather than those Han who settled in Xinjiang in the fifties and sixties. He believes there is a measure of mutual respect between these  Han and the Uygur that does not exist with the newer breed of Han "migrant".  This class of "migrant's" loyalty to Xinjiang is transient and based only on a desire to "make a quick buck" and return to the inland. They are also obviously very much imbued with PRC propaganda and as a result treat the Uygur with open disdain thus fueling ethnic tension.                            Little open support for Separation..                               -Prof Mackerras-                Surprisingly the Professor noted very little solidarity among the Muslims of Xinjiang. The Uygur, Kazakhs and the Hui worship in their own mosques and provide little support to each other as a religious community. In fact he pointed out that  there is quite a lot of ethnic tension as between the Uygur and The Kazakhs despite them being both Muslim and Turkic.  With regards to the issues of Separatism he found little support for the concept among the Uygur he spoke with but he did qualify this by saying he did not expect them to be vociferous on the subject to a foreigner. He went on to say that The PRC's position on "Uygur terrorism" was to a large degree political opportunism but that it was not without some basis.   Demographic Changes   An interesting aside was the professors observations about the data from the 1990 and 2000 official population censuses.  He claims that the initial figures released by the PRC showed Xinjiang's population to be 19.25 million and this reflected a rapid increase in the Han proportion above the 1990 census. This total population figure he noted is also sometimes quoted as being 18.49 m.  The difference apparently is in the number of "non residents" captured in the census.   He theorises that if "non residents" mean people who have not been in Xinjiang for more than twelve months then this differential of some 791,000 must represent Han immigration in a twelve month period, less of course true short term visitors such as tourists, army and business people.  Whatever this latter group's numbers are these figure are truly startling. If we extrapolate from that then upwards  of some 750,000 Han have entered Xinjiang permanently since say 1999 giving credence to those commentators who believe the Han is now the dominant ethnic group in Xinjiang.  Another point raised by the Professor is that on this trip he saw much less evidence of larger Uygur families. Whereas before he would often see families of up to nine he did not notice this so much this time. He did not elaborate as to what he thought the reasons for this may be.    Conclusion   The Professor's conclusion was that through a policy of "stick and carrot" the Chinese are winning the battle for Xinjiang, if in fact they have not already won it.   Modernisation and rising living standards have gone a fair way in lessening ethnic unrest among the Uygur and whilst he does not catagorically state that the "Uygur Question" is solved from a Chinese perspective he believes that it is on the way to being so.  Finally, he could not forsee any future separatist inspired strife of any consequence and as such believed that the Chinese are being unreasonably hard in continuing their fairly heavy  policies and practices concerning the Uygur.

						    urlLink Banned Books Week      Tohti Tunyaz  was an up and coming young man. I say he was because at the moment he has had his career put on hold by the Peoples Republic of China.  You see Tohti is a spy. Or so they say.   Tohti is an Uygur and an historian and he has currently 3 years into an eleven year sentence in an Urumqi Xinjiang jail for " stealing state secrets for foreign persons"    The Man   Tohti Tunyaz (pen-name: Tohti Muzart) is an ethnic Uighur historian and writer.  Tohti graduated from the history department of the Central Institute of Nationalities, Beijing, in 1984 and was assigned to work for the China National Standing Committee. During this time he reportedly formed a close relationship with former Xinjiang governors Seyfundin Eziz and Ismail Emet, and was involved in the translation of some of Eziz's works.   Tohti began studying for his PhD at Tokyo University's School of Humanities in Japan in 1995, specializing in Uighur history and ethnic relations. He has reportedly published several papers on Uighur history in Japan, and has published a book in Beijing.   Tohti is married with two children who remain in Japan    The Arrest   Tohti re-entered China for the purposes of research for his doctoral thesis He was arrested in Urumqi, Xinjiang on February 6, 1998 where he had gone to collect research material. He had reportedly been watched by security police for some time prior to his arrest, and he is claimed to have been arrested with allegedly sensitive material in his possession  Some reports claim that the content of this material related to ethnic relations published for classified circles only, others that it was material published for the general public.   Tohti Tunyaz is said to have been formally charged with  'inciting national disunity' and 'stealing state secrets for foreign persons'  charges that were upheld by the Supreme Court.     The Court Decision and Response   Tohti was convicted in March 1999 by the Urumqi Intermediate People's Court, and his conviction and 11-year sentence in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region Prison No. 3 was confirmed on appeal in March 2000.   The courts decisions was based on the supposition that the Tohti intended to publish a book in Japanese for the purpose of instigating national disunity, and made copies of confidential documents at Urumqi in order to leak them to foreigners. Also it was alleged that he published a book in Japan in 1998 entitled  The Inside Story of the Silk Road  which incited national disunity and saparatism.   According to the court's decision, which was reportedly read by supporters in Urumqi in  August 1999, neither the book nor its manuscript was submitted to the court as a proof.   As far as is known Tohti's colleages claim that he wrote no such book in Japan. As to leaking confidential documents supporters state that it would appear that the only proven "crime" is that of obtaining and copying part of a 50-year-old document for his research with the help of an official librarian, which the authorities claimed was "theft of classified information" and "inciting national disunity"  It is further claimed by supporters that the  "foreigners " who was alleged to have received the documents were never identified at the trial. Consequently, his supporters argue, the decision was based on a misrepresentation of the facts concerning Tohti's scholarly activities. His real and only intention, they say, was to collect source materials in order to complete his doctoral thesis dealing with the modern history of the Uygur people.    "It can't be,"   they said, recalling that Tohti was well-known for being critical of the Uighur independence movement.  Tohti's wife has stated   "If my husband were a real believer in independence from China for his home region, he would be ready to risk his life,"  said Tohti's wife Rabiya, 37, who lives in Japan with their son and a 4-year-old daughter.  "But the Chinese court's charges are unjust and intolerable. I should have appealed to the public earlier."  referring to her having kept quiet at the time of  his arrest. ."  urlLink  Kyodo News 22/9/2002    In December 2001, the  United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention  issued an official opinion declaring Mr. Tohti to be arbitrarily detained. It further concluded  that the Chinese court's sentence was in violation of Tohti's freedom of thought and speech by extended interpretation of "state secrets" and that it violates  Article 16 of the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and stipulations in the  International Covenants on Human Rights .   The committee's official opinion that Tohti was arbitrarily detained is nonbinding because China did not ratify the treaties  Tohti has received wide support from Academic circles in Japan and in August, 1999 Professor Sato and a colleague, Professor Kishimoto Mio, visited Urmuchi in order to see him.  Two other Professors (Kishimoto and Yamaguchi) visited Urmuchi together with Tohti's son in 2000 and were afforded a short meeting with him.   The Japanese government has little to say on the case taking the line that it is an internal affair of the Chinese, in fairness to them, however, Tohti was at the time of his arrest a Chinese citizen.  " The Japanese government has no say in (China's) domestic affairs, " said an official at the Japanese Foreign Ministry's China and Mongolia Division in charge of human rights. " The issue of ethnic minorities is a raw nerve in China. Doing nothing could be useful for (Tohti). "     Analysis and Conclusion   My first reaction to learning of the background of this story was to jump up and down ranting that the Chinese once again have committed a gross violation of human rights.  But as I thought about this and other high profile cases such as that of  urlLink Rebiya Kadir  the more I had to take a step back and consider the whole thing more deeply. Not only about these particular cases but the whole strategy of dealing with the Chinese over such matters.  Firstly, we have to admit that a nation state has the "right" to treat it's citizens in accordance with the laws of the land. In doing so, by and large, it's actions should not normally be the concern of others.  If I can draw an analogy here, what one family deems to be the correct way to raise children may differ from how other families view raising children. This is certainly just as true within a culture and definately true between cultures. Being different is not wrong per se.   A family also is not obliged to justify every decision it makes as to how it raises those children.   Again there is a line in the sand and obviously this line, if overstepped, can justifiably draw outside criticism and intervention.  What we have in the Tohti case is a court exercising authority vested in it under the constitution of the People's Republic of China. Like most such cases in China there is very little transparency. Without being a Constitutional lawyer one would think that this is because the constitution does not require such openness and transparancy.  So, essentially we have a case where due course of law has been followed in the Chinese context. Essentially then we have very little recourse and the Chinese can effectively say "mind your own business"  What the problem with the Tohti case and all the others involving the Uygurs, Tibetans et al is not that the result is wrong but that it is not  seen to be right . Therein lies a very major difference.  What we are prone to do is "humanise" the process. In other words put a name to a case.   We then run off and say free Tohti Tunyaz  Why do we automatically do this? Because some friends and relative say he is not a spy and because it is China?  But the esssence of the problem is that Tohti Tunyaz may very well be a spy and by humanising the case we allow the Chinese to scoff at our stupidity and ignore us further.  In the words of the Japanese government spokesman by humanising a case we may very well be detrimental to the person if that person is innocent.  We therfore should not out of hand be demanding the release of Tohti because we believe he is innocent but instead we should be asking  for proof that he is guilty. Again a very subtle difference.  Back to our analogy, if the children of family are in danger then authorities should act. It is to them that we should go when seeking intercession. In the case of China the "authorities" are the U.N. and our individual Governments.   Amnesty International et al will not get one person released from a Chinese prison and may in fact be responsible for that person serving a full term where otherwise he may not have. The Chinese will not want to lose face as an early release may evidence that they have cowed to international pressure.  What I am saying then is that we can not tell the Chinese what to do, we can only show them why it is in their interests to act in a certain way.   In the family analogy a Child Protection Unit Officer will say to a parent "alter your ways or we will take decisive action"  We should not be lobbying China or criticising China we should be lobbying and criticising our governments for not showing China why it would be in their interests to act in a certain manner and for not sending in the "Child Protection Unit".  Do we send in the "Child Protection Unit"? Obviously not, China has the Olympics don't they?  Look at todays headlines alone  urlLink Ford Plans $1 billion Plant in China  and  urlLink Australia China Free Trade Talks . Every day you will see hundreds of such examples.  We not only do not send in "The Protection Unit" but we are crawling over ourselves to aid and abet them in their abuses.   China has well and truly entered the big world. The are subject now as never before to the inter-dependencies arising from globalisation and their ever increasing need for foreign trade and investment.  Do our governments say " Hey China we are not going to invest one more dollar in you or buy any more of your goods or sell you anymore of our raw materials until you become far more transparent? No we do not.  Save your breath berating the Chinese. Any nation that can and does regularly shoot it's people in back of the neck or throw them in jail arbitrarily is not going to have any concerns over a few emails or news articles.  Berate your governments, flood them with emails.   It is funny but elected democratic governments can be fairly attuned to Public Opinion.   Tell them it is time to send in the Child Protection Unit!   P.S. May I just say that I mentioned Amnesty International only because of their high profile and that they have my full respect in what they do best, that is, alerting us to these sorts of problems.   As for Tohti I will not say that he is innocent or guilty (1997/1998 were difficult times for the Uygur and many Uygur did things outside of their character as a result) and I will not be signing any petition to the Chinese Government. I will however be sending some emails to the Australian Government (I am Australian by the way) asking them to consider penalties unless the Chinese become far more transparent. I would not hold my breath on either result.

						    urlLink Radio Free Asia          Uygur Defectors In Toronto Picture courtesy of the "Toronto Star"      You may remember the story from a week or so back about the seven members of an Uygur Acrobatic troupe that defected in Canada during a Chinese Government organised cultural visit there to celebrate Chinese New Year.  Well, in a follow up one of the female Uygur acrobats has told how she and other woman of the troupe were co-erced by their Chinese "minders" to perform extra- curricular duties.   Aygul,   one of seven Uyghur acrobats,  stated that   "Once we were taken to a private party room in the Fulu Hotel to carry out a so-called political duty " Aygul said.  "After the performance, we were not allowed to go back home but forced to eat and drink with the official leaders. The worst thing was, we were forced to keep the official leaders happy by drinking alcoholic wine, even if we said no"   She said the Manager of the acrobatic troupe,  Zheng Qinhai , also commanded women in the troupe to invite his guests to dance, as a   "political duty".   "After drinking alcoholic wine, we were also forced to invite the official leaders for dancing. It is actually against our traditional rules"  she said. (The Uygur being predominantly Muslims are forbidden from drinking alcohol)  Members of the troupe complied through fear of losing their jobs.  More worrying however is the report that the Acrobat's families back in Xinjiang had been threatened.  Aygul said her family in the regional capital, Urumqi, had already received threats from the Chinese authorities.   "They told my family that without my going back to Urumqi, they would confiscate our house. It is so unfair. We just bought that house by saving every single penny... for 20 years... It is our private house, it is not a free house given by the government. They have no right and no reason"  she said.   This story highlights a problem with touring "Cultural Groups" from China in that they are used as part of the overall Chinese Government propaganda supporting the notion that the country is "one big happy family".  Every occasion of any importance in China, such as visits of foreign dignitaries, has the obligatory trouping out of the "happy ethnic group" to dance and perform their unique music.   One can not of course blame the performers, they are doing what is in their nature to do and in most instances it is a way for them to earn above average wages and to travel.  In the case of the Uygur at least these "performances" are nothing more than tools of state propaganda and are treated by the Chinese as  little more than "dancing bear" routines.  One can only hope that the families of the defectors are not unduly treated by the Chinese government

						    urlLink NPR : Tibet 'Treasures' Exhibit Prompts Protests   An exhibit of Tibetan art which opened in California has apparently aroused protests from "Tibetan Exiles" according to a local radio station.   Regardless of the political situation in Tibet or Xinjiang the cultures of the these peoples must be celebrated and I would think it highly unlikely that either would have "protested' against any exhibition of their art unless it was run by the Chinese government for propaganda reasons.   Any publicity is good publicity for the cause of the Uygurs and Tibetans but I am continually amazed that a small Tibetan art exhibition in a town in California can make it into the work news when the Uygur, whose cultural art by the way is of a high calibre as well, rarely rate any media coverage.   I will make it a subject of a post one day as to why this is so for the dynamics of international "protest" is very intriguing.   Check out the five photos they have in the article, it is worth the visit.

						    urlLink Demographic Trends: China      China is a populace place. At 1.3 billion people and growing rapidly population trend analysis must be of paramount importance to government planners.   The above linked article highlights some disturbing trends in China's demographics such as           "The sex ratio" in some areas of China is as high 130:100 (male/female) and generally is higher than the accepted world ratio of around 103:100   By 2025 there will be 300 million people in China above 60 years of age   In ten years China will face a "bride shortage" unprecedented in world history    Of course China's 'two child' policy has a lot to do with two of these trends. Parents are practicing  "birth sex selection" through the likes of abortion to ensure the birth of sons who are considered better long term investments in terms of rural labour and as "superannuation policies" for parents.  The other trend, the aging of the population, is a concern as China does not have an aged social security programme nor has superannuation planning been a priority in China as it has in the west.  In the words of the columnist whereas Japan got rich before it got old China will get old before it gets rich.  The social ramifications of these trends are immense. A population bigger than the United States, a very high percentage of which having no form of income other than as provided by family, and millions of men without partners.   The psychological impact on the mental health of the nation alone is staggering to contemplate let alone the financial aspects.  It is interesting to note in her article that the skewing of the sex ratios does not apply (yet) to the Uygurs and the Tibetans whom as minorities had, until recently at least, been excluded from the "two child policy" and whose religions would look poorly upon certain "sex selection" techniques.

						      urlLink Book exposes the misery of China's forgotten peasants - World - www.smh.com.au      In my studies of the Uygur people I am often amazed at the juxtaposition of urban Han prosperity and rural poverty evident in Xinjiang.  When one looks at the modern glass and steel city of Urumqi (home to a majority Han Population) and the unpaved and poorly serviced rural towns like Lop one can not help feeling that in Xinjiang the money goes where the money comes and where the money comes the Han go.    This article about a new book by Chen Guidi and Wu Chuntao, a husband and wife team who spent three years researching their 460-page  Report on the Condition of China's Peasants , say China is becoming "one country with two systems" is truly timely and it is far overdue in highlighting what is becoming an increasing chasm not only for Uygur rural peoples but obviously for the rural peoples of China generally.                            Palliative measures get introduced when the poverty cycle becomes a crisis, but no fundamental reforms are introduced to change the social and political system that exploits the peasants                               -Report on the Condition of China's Peasants-                     It is all very well for the PRC to be riding the crest of an export boom and raking in the hard currency if it does not, to a degree at least, share the benefits of this new found wealth with all peoples of China, especially the ethnic rural minorities.  Xinjiang has always been a hard place. It is an area of mountains and deserts interspersed with oases a region where the Uygur have eked out an existence for nigh on two thousand years.    There are numerous problems of desertification  rising salinity levels and infrastructure all which will only further impact on rural poverty.  It is hoped that this book may draw some world attention to what feasibly is a potential source of internal strife and in a land of 1.2 billion this is to be avoided at all costs.

						      urlLink Press Release - USCIRF Recommends 11 Nations to Secretary Powell As Countries of Particular Concern     The U.S.  Commission on International Religious Freedom  (USCIRF) has recommended to the US   Secretary of State  that it designate 11 countries as "countries of particular concern" (CPCs) for the systematic, ongoing violations of religious freedom. Not suprisingly China is one of the nations classified.   The U.S. Congress created the Commission in 1998 and the Commission is charged with identifying countries that practice on-going violations of religious liberty and recommending economic and diplomatic steps that the U.S. government should take to pressure governments to end religious persecution.   The covering letter of the commission's findings to Secretary of State Colin Powell (Feb, 10 2004) states in part:  " The Commission remains especially concerned about the situation in China, where repression of religious freedom continues to be a deliberate policy of the Chinese government. In the past year, Chinese authorities have intensified their violent campaign against religious believers, including Evangelical Christians, Roman Catholics,  Uighur Muslims, Tibetan Buddhists , and other groups, such as the Falun Gong. This campaign has included imprisonment, torture, and other forms of ill treatment. As you know, the Commission attempted to travel to China twice in the past year but was thwarted in both attempts by unacceptable limits imposed by the Chinese government that prevented such a visit. The Commission recently visited Hong Kong, but continues to seek a visit to other regions of China."                                 Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance                                 - Article 18, Universal Declaration of Human Rights               The Constitution   Religious freedom in China is “guaranteed” under the Constitution of The People’s Republic of China (1998) as the following extract states:   Article 36 of the PRC Constitution (as amended) 1998   " Citizens of the People's Republic of China enjoy freedom of religious belief. No state organ, public organisation or individual may compel citizens to believe in, or not believe in, any religion; nor may they discriminate against citizens who believe in, or do not believe in, any religion. The state protects normal religious activities. No one may make use of religion to engage in activities that disrupt public order, impair the health of citizens or interfere with the educational system of the state. Religious bodies and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign domination."      Article 36 of the Constitution is quite clear in guaranteeing China’s citizens the right to enjoy freedom of religious belief.   There is however a rider, one that is all powerful:   “ No one may make use of religion to engage in activities that disrupt public order..”  or “interfere with the educational system of the state”   The Reality   The Chinese claim that the Uygur people of Xinjiang, as do all China's citizens, enjoy great religious freedoms. The supporters of the Uygur and independent organisations and commentators say they do not.   The Chinese claim that:   “ The great majority of Islamic people in Xinjiang and other religious believers there are patriotic and law-abiding and conduct their religious activities as permitted by laws and regulations and government policies. ”  urlLink Chinese Embassy US   The opposition claims that the “ laws and regulations and government policies ” amount to nothing less than religious persecution and denial of Uygur rights as set out in the constitution. And further that these “laws and regulations” are  being used to destroy Uygur culture.  What then is the true case? Who is right?     Firstly some history......    Prior to the  urlLink Cultural Revolution  in 1966 the Uygurs enjoyed almost normal freedoms of religion. With the advent of the Cultural Revolution  there was a massive wave of anti religious feeling throughout China and, for Xinjiang and the Uygur, this resulted in deprivation of religious freedoms and the destruction of many hundreds of masjids (mosques).  After the Cultural Revolution in the years 1983 to 1996 Uygur Muslims experienced virtually no religious persecution, on the contrary their religion began to prosper.  Masjids destroyed in the days of the Cultural Revolution were repaired and rebuilt and the total stock was actually added to. Restrictions on trips to Mecca were loosened and reputedly some 30,000  Xinjiang Muslims were allowed to take the trip. State Officials, employees and young people were not banned or actively “discouraged” from openly practicing their religion as is the case today.   It would appear, however, that in years 1996/97 the Chinese authorities’ position vis a vis the Uygur changed dramatically and from the Uygur's point of view certainly not for the better.   Whether the Chinese became aware of some significant Separatist/Islamic/Terrorist plan, or concluded that the growing Uygur unrest and sentiment for Uygur Separatism had either religious foundations or that religious gatherings were being used as venues to ferment unrest, we may never know. We do know that the Chinese attitude as it concerns the "Uygur Question" changed very comprehensively and very brutally.    Now to today   It is impossible to analyse all claims of religious persecution in the space available in this format so I will look a few items only.     Masjids And Their Use     A point often made in any article on Uygur religious freedom is that those under the age of 18 are not allowed to enter mosques.  Prior to 1996 this does not seem to have been the case.   It has been said that this is a distinct policy of the Chinese applied only to the Uygur and is an attempt to break the  “religious cycle”  to raise up a generation of "Uygur atheists".  (The) “ Chinese government is trying to cultivate Uyghur’s next generation as an atheist.(sic) If you visit east Turkistan you will see on the door of each mosque was written that less than 18 years old are forbidden to enter”  (sic)  urlLink  Religious Intolerance    (It must be said that while this particular case is unique generally speaking in China children of primary and secondary school age are not allowed to be overtly religious in public.)  I put the question as to what restrictions are placed on "Inland Muslims" (closer to Beijing) to a  urlLink Muslim Hui  from Yunnan China who is a devout Muslim but no great lover of the system and his answer was:  “ Yes, there are some restrictions, for example primary school and middle school must be non-religious in China ”  In response to my question as to age restrictions in Masjids he goes on to say,   “ but not the kind you mentioned, even junior communist members can go to Masjid in inland China”    So it is obvious from this and other anecdotal information that this is a distinct discrimination against Uygur Muslims that is not practiced against Chinese/Hui Muslims. As such it must be an open violation of the Constitution despite the rider, for why would any 17 year old Uygur boy, by going to a mosque, be more likely to “ make use of religion to engage in activities that disrupt public order .” than his Hui ethnic counterpart?   Another standard complaint raised in the West is that the building of Masjids is outlawed in Xinjiang.    Tom Malinowski   Director of Human Rights Watch testifying in front U.S. House of Representatives Committee on International Relations recently stated:  “  As the State Department report makes clear, authorities in Xinjiang have in fact cracked down on all independent manifestations of faith by Muslims. Officials have prohibited the building of new mosques....”    The Chinese in response to similar criticisms in the past have kept a line similar to the following quote:  “ There are nine million Moslems in Xinjiang, accounting for half of all the Moslems in China, but the number of mosques in the region totals 23,000 and represents two-thirds of the total in China, or one mosque for every 200 Moslems”   urlLink Chinese Embassy USA   From my understanding the Chinese figures are reasonably correct and therefore it does beg the question as to why the Uygurs would need more mosques? (if in fact they really do) In a land of religious privations the per capita mosque count must be considered reasonable.  The real problem however is not not being allowed to build masjids but in the ability to use them as they wish. The Chinese position is very much like the United States saying to it’s citizens that they have the right to bear arms but you can not have ammunition:  “ In its survey analysis of the religious freedom situation in the Xinjiang-Uighur Autonomous Region of north-western China (previously known as Eastern Turkestan), Forum 18 News Service reports on the pervasive state control over the religious life of native Muslims, who make up about half the local population. Mosques are strictly controlled by the authorities and all the imam-hatybs are state-appointed. Posters on mosques declare that children under 18 cannot attend, while an unofficial order bans employees of state-run companies from attending under threat of dismissal.”  Muslim News UK    Islamic Literature   Another point often raised is the freedom of religious literature. It has been claimed that many religious texts are banned and that some, for example, are banned from sale in the Uygur language but are freely available to non Uygur Muslims. This would seem to be borne out by many sources.  Rukiye Turdush in her moving article  urlLink 35 Days in East Turkistan  reports on a conversation with a Hui Muslim:  “One Hui [Chinese Muslim from Central China] man..... tried to explain Hui history to me.   ‘ For us religion is not very restricted. I don’t understand why the government has restricted the Uyghur’s religion. Usually most of the religious books which ( are banned from use ) used by the Uyghurs are published by our publishing house.’  he said.”  There are many other supporting anecdotal reports along similar veins.                             The state protects normal religious activities                                 PRc Constitution                    Private Religious Study   Another oft heard complaint is that the Uygur are restricted from the private study of the Qu’ran. By private I mean not through the Masjids but either in home groups or Uygur religious schools (madrassas). It would appear that the Chinese have a great fear that small groups of Uygurs meeting behind closed doors pose a security threat. As such these Madrassas  (Islamic Schools) are outlawed and even small gatherings of families and friends for religious study are not tolerated  " Fear is rampant among the Uyghur religious community. There is no place where ordinary Uyghur Muslims can teach their children what their forefathers believed for more than one thousand years. I always wanted to teach my son Azimat Ghayret who is now in Urumchi to study Quran. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any place to send him since China considers private religious education as illegal religious activity.”   Ghayret Sidik  urlLink  Testimony to the US Government Committee                               No single person in China has been or will be detained or imprisoned simply because of their religious beliefs or their legal religious activities                                 PRC American Embassy 2000               Conclusion  Despite the “guarantees” of the Chinese Constitution and the words of their Ambassadors and others there is no unfettered freedom of religion in China.  For the Uygur it appears that they are being singled out for repressive religious policies above and beyond that which the other ethnic or religious groups are experiencing (with the possible exception of the Tibetans).  The Chinese are using the constitution (which supposedly guarantees religious freedom) to actually assist them in denying same to yhe Uygur. By using arbitrary judgements of “state security” and “public order” backed up by state run courts they are severely curtailing the Uygurs peaceful enjoyment of their religion.   Uygurs are being harassed, jailed or even worse for their religious beliefs.   In the words of  Ghayret Sidik   “ Today, the only way for the Uyghurs to be a good citizen is to give up their religion, culture, tradition, and way of life and totally conform to the standard of the Chinese government”.

						        The  Uygur Letter   is dedicated to the Uygur people of Xinjiang. It’s raison d’etre is to help promote world awareness of the Uygur and the situation they currently face in China.  If they are known at all, then they are known to a majority of people as just one of the 56 Ethnic groups in the world’s most populated nation. Their “claim to fame” is that they suffer human rights violations at the hands of a nation of people, whom predominantly are ethnically and culturally different to them.   Their story to many is very much a contemporary one, one of international politics, dissent, nationalism and human rights. A story of an indigenous people battling to maintain their culture and way of life in the face of a rolling juggernaut.  But the Uygur are more than that.  The Uygur have an incredible  history. They have an wonderful culture that has had an immense impact on Central Asia, China and the world. Their music and dance for example is both beautiful and passionate.   The Uygur people are enigmatic. They have a timelessness about them that one can not describe.  Like the wolves that figure prominently in their folklore, they have a presence that speaks of an unstated superiority in the scheme of things. It is not the “superiority” of say an American an Englishmen or a German. It is somehow different, it speaks of having seen it all and having survived, of waiting.  Over a period, depending on how news breaks, I would like to introduce you to them. Their history, their culture, where and how they live. I think it is important to put a face to the people.  Today I would like to talk very briefly of the early history from their days of nomadic roaming across Mongolia and southern Siberia through to their empire and eventual migration to what is now China.    The History.........   Uygur history has been played out on a stage that would try even the most inventive of fantasy writers in their attempt to recreate it. Towering snow caped mountain ranges, blistering deserts, rugged mountain passes and verdant oases. All in an area that is the farthest point from any ocean on our planet.   Add to this scenario marauding tribes of "barbarian" nomads, battles and conflicts, in-fighting, historic trade routes and political intrigues at the highest office of some of the greatest empires and Dynasties in history, the Uygur were at the center of it all. Not only as bystanders but as active participants.  The influence of the Uygur on the history of central Asia is undoubted by any who know it; their influence on the history and culture of the world is grossly unacknowledged and underestimated.  For over two thousand years the Uygur have played a central role in the historical and cultural development of the central Asian region. Around the time of Christ the Uygur were emerging as a potent political, military and cultural force.   In constant battle or confederation with the numerous tribes of the region as well as the dynasties of the Han and Tang Chinese the Uygur grew into a great Central Asian empire. Their influence as concerns religion, literature, law making, diplomacy, industry and trade was immense.                            Compared to the Europeans of that time, the Uyghurs were far more advanced.                                 Albert von Lecoq                   The consequences of these experiences combined with their political and intellectual maturity would eventually, through their subsequent influence on the Mongols, have ramifications felt around the world and have a very real influence upon civilisation as we now know it.  Being at the very crossroads of two great cultures, East and West, the Uygurs acted as conduits for the transference of culture and tradegoods. Over the centuries they have been involved, one way or the other, in the intrigues, the strategic and political positioning of great religions, nations and empires.   The Chinese Dynasties, British and Russian Empires, the Soviets, the communist Chinese and lately the Americans all have wooed the Uygurs and just as many times betrayed them. Buddhism and Islam have both been championed by the Uygurs and their influence in the growth of these religions in both in Central Asia and China is very significant.  To a modern world, that knows little or nothing of them, claims as to the Uygur's global influence would come as a great surprise. However, in learning more about these unique people, surprise will give way to admiration of a people that for 2,000 years have defied great events and empires to develop a unique and wonderful culture in the very crucible of modern civilisation.   A people who have, to this date, over 2,000 years, maintained their cultural an ethnic identity in the face of immense military and political powers and pressures.   Ab Initio: Rise and Supremacy    The tribes and clans that would eventually become known as the Uygur rose in Mongolia and Southern Siberia and were first mentioned in Han Dynasty histories in the first century BCE.  There is hypothesis that the Uygur were descendants of the Hun, however this does not seem to be proven. Chinese records would indicate that they can definitely be traced back to the Dingling nomadic tribe that roamed north and north western present day China and in areas south of Lake Baykal (south central Siberia) and between the Intush River and Lake Balkush.  In 744 CE the Uygurs threw off the yoke of the then ruling  Go Turk   tribes and under ruler  Khutlugh Bilge Kul Khagan  (Khagan meaning Ruler/King) founded the first true state constituted under the name Uygur.  The Uygurs commenced the building of this empire by subjugation of other Turkic tribes of central Asia and eventually extended Uygur sovereignty north to Lake Bayakal, east to present day Gansu China and South west to present day India. The capital of the Uygur empire was established in Togabash on the banks of the Okhun River and their empire became known as the “Orkhun Uygur Empire”  As an example of their power and prestige in the years 755-757 The Tang Dynasty of the Middle Kingdom China were facing an internal rebellion and requested help from the militarily powerful Uygur to help quell it.   The Uygur successfully prosecuted several campaigns and eventually the Tang where triumphant. In reward they bestowed favourable trade terms on the Uygur as well as an annual Tribute measured in silk. The Chinese Emperor also gave his daughter as a bride to the Uygur Khagan and all told in the period 740 - 840 CE three Chinese Princesses would become Uygur  Khatuns  (Khagan’s wives)  The Uygur empire came to an end in 840 when the Kyrghiz, another Turkic tribe, brought the Uygur predominance to a close.  It was after their defeat at the hands of the Kryghiz that the Uygur migrated to the Tarim Basin area in what is now present day Xinjiang and to the now Gansu Province in China, areas that had formed part of their previous empire.

						           In a recent article   urlLink “Uygurs: Friendless In Central Asia”    I alluded to the role China plays in manipulating sentiment among the Central Asian nations and others concerning the “Uygur Question”    (Ahmadjan Osman pictured courtesy of Al-Hayat (Arabic) )   Essentially, I argued that China uses it’s economic clout to impel these nations into taking a pro-China stance over the Uygur Question in return for economic, diplomatic and other favours. As such, where once the Turkic countries showed support for the Uygur now they are more than likely to turn a blind eye at best or actively support China at worst.  But it is not only the Uygur’s Turkic “brothers” that are increasingly distancing themselves from their situation. Other nations too are being “encouraged” by China, in it’s day to day diplomatic relations, to act in a way that is detrimental to the Uygur cause.  A recent event that appears to have the hand of the PRC in it is the deportation of a respected Poet from Syria.  Ahmadjan Osman  is a Poet,  well known in the Arab world for his command of the classical Arabic poetic tradition, is married to a Syrian national and has resided in Syria for 15 years.  But he is also an Uygur and an occasional contributor to Radio Free Asia, an organisation, among other things, often  critical of the PRC’s ethnic policies.   These two things it would seem has resulted in his deportation from Syria. This has occurred despite the foregoing and despite having the support of  270 prominent figures in the world of Arabic poetry, including the Syrian poet and Nobel Literature Prize nominee Adunis, who have signed a petition, and staged a demonstration against the deportation order.   Osman in an interview with  urlLink Radio Free Asia  after his deportation claims that he has never used either his poetry or his contributions to Radio Free Asia for political ends and knows no reason why the Damascus authorities have acted as they have.  Why then has Syria deported him?  One can only conjecture that the deportation came about at the behest of the Chinese Government, who are known to have a strong and growing influence in the countries of the Middle East. This is especially true with nations like Syria who are feeling isolated and a little vulnerable with the recent changes in Iraq and Libya.  China seems to delight in obtaining these small concessions, these little shows of support from their client states or those wishing to curry favour with them.   In getting Osman deported it would serve the purpose of sending a strong and unconditional message to those Uygur in diaspora and at home that the tentacles of the PRC are long and far reaching and that no “victory” for them is too small. It is telling them “do not think you can use your position or potential influence against us”.  What is in it for the Syrians?  Economic considerations perhaps, promises of support in the event of America moving against it? Who knows? But somewhere along the line they will be repaid, of that there is no doubt, that, after all, is the nature of diplomacy.   They are small these PRC victories but they are far from hollow ones. Each in it’s own way is another “straw on the camels back”, each weighing that little more heavily upon the collective will of the Uygur people.  =============================================================   The Uygur (Uighur) of Xinjiang need the support of the world in the attainment of basic human rights.

						      The People’s Republic of China is predictable if nothing else.   Recently in the world’s media China has been getting quite a lot of attention over the “Uygur Question”. It started in earnest in December last year when the People’s Daily, the PRC’s official news organ, published a list of  “Uygur Terrorist Organisations”.  This type of press statement by the PRC is not unusual and it appears to be a part of a premeditated, pre-programmed and ongoing justification of their continued violations of the Uygur’s human rights in the name of the “War on Terror”.  What was striking about this piece in particular was that at the top of it’s  “most wanted” list was a supposed terrorist leader who had in fact been dead for almost three months!  I commented at the time in my article  urlLink China’s Bin Laden: The Terrorist China Forgot”   that such a significant faux pas was perhaps indicative that a) China’s stand on terrorism has another agenda,  b) That these press releases are written months in advance and pre scheduled for periodic release and c) just how seriously do the PRC believe their own propaganda (not very obviously).  I have also mentioned on several occasions that the PRC is very reactive to the world's media if it is critical of the PRC's Uygur policies and that as sure as the sun rises once they have received significant criticism up will pop a new “justification” piece.  Well, true to form we have yesterday a fresh item of  “news” appearing in another lesser known official news agency the China Daily (also mirrored in Xinhuanet).  In an article entitled  urlLink Joint efforts to combat terrorism saluted   China Daily) Updated: 2004-02-13 23:07 the lead in paragraph states and I quote:    “The Chinese Ministry of Public Security on Friday reiterated China's firm support for international co-operation in combating terrorism and its hope of gaining more assistance from other countries for its anti-terror endeavour.”    All very fine and well you may say. A noble cause and a just sentiment.  They then go straight on to say, and again I quote whilst holding back an undignified  chuckle:  “A ministry spokesperson said the publicising of a list of the first identified "East Turkistan" terrorist organisations and 11 terrorists by the ministry on December 15, 2003 has drawn active responses from the international community”  Well you have to hand it to them for they tell no lies here, however, they do neglect to mention that they are not responses of overwhelming support as you would imagine from reading this paragraph.  If by “international community” they mean the Diplomatic Corp then I have not seen one thing for or against from this august body concerning the December article. If they mean the international media, web chat sites, forums, blogs, notice boards etc then they did receive very active responses; overwhelmingly negative.  The China Daily then goes into full justification mode with supposed “confessions” of Uygur prisoners pointing an accusing finger at the head of ETIC,  (East Turkistan Information Centre headquartered in Europe) Abudujelili Kalakash  claiming that he personally ran Uygur terrorists within China supplying them with equipment and money.  As well the leader of the WUYC (World Uygur Youth Conference) Dolqun Isa  comes in for similar treatment being also accused of several similar things.  Finally, it gives the dire warnings that  ETIM   (East Turkistan Islamic Movement), whose alleged leader died last year is planning revenge attacks. In other words read "stay tuned we will have reports of these incidents coming soon in our main bulletin".  Of course I and no-one else can verify these claims and please see my levity in the last paragraph for what it is, but, one truly has to question the veracity of any information garnered from Uygur prisoners given China’s alleged use of torture as a method of obtaining “confessions”    One can only look for patterns in an attempt to learn the truth and the pattern I see most clearly from the PRC in it's press releases is one of pre-planned propaganda, immediate reaction to criticism and the setting of the stage for further "reveals". Stay tuned for the next installment!   =============================================================  The Uygur (Uighur) of Xinjiang need the support of the world in the attainment of basic human rights.

						      In February 1997 there erupted riots in the Xinjiang city of Ghulja (Chinese name Yining) involving, some say, 1,000 Uygurs and resulting in the direct deaths of between 10 and 200 Uygur and Han Chinese depending on whose version you believe.  The Ghulja riots marked a watershed in the the Uygur's human rights history and it had two very opposite effects.  On one hand it focused the world's attention on the Uygur cause. Whereas before the P.R.C had been very successful in hiding the unrest growing in this large ethnic group in Xinjiang the advent of Ghulja changed that forever, never again would what happens in Xinjiang remain totally hidden.  Ghulja brought the attention of the world's press to Xinjiang, focused human rights activists on the plight of the Uygur and gave impetus to the Uygur in diaspora to take up "cyber activism" in a significant way.   In that respect Ghulja was a positive despite the unfortunate deaths of peoples caught up in the riots.  However Ghulja marked another turning point, one that seven years later has appeared to have totally negated the "positives"  China's response was swift, brutal  and had a far reaching impact on the future of the Uygur.  Within hours and days of the riot martial law was instigated in the major cities of Xinjiang. Thousands of Uygurs were rounded up and thrown in jail, tens of them reportedly, never to be seen or heard of again.  There were reports of summary executions of up to 30 Uygur on the day of the riot, other reports had in excess of 30 Uygur dying as a result of being left in the open in minus 17 c temperature after being drenched with fire hoses and arrested.  Executions of alleged participants numbering in their hundreds began almost immediately with the last Ghulja "rioter" to be executed only as recent as October 2003.  Despite this massive response and it's immediate effects this was not the only end result of Ghulja. The PRC immediately claimed that the riot was  organised by "Uygur terrorists" and  begun in earnest an intensive  propaganda campaign both internally and internationally "justifying"that the PRC "crackdown" on the Uygurs equated with what would be later to be termed as the  "War on Terror"  Ghulja thus was a double edged sword for the Uygur. On one hand it provided the much needed international awareness of their cause but on the other hand cost them immensely in terms of loss of life, rights and liberty, consequences that still very much being felt today. If we were called to prepare a balance sheet on Ghulja and it's after effects the Uygur would undoubtedly be very much in the red.  What were the events of the day? Was it a "riot" organised by "Separatist/Islamic Uygur Terrorists" or was it a spontaneous uprising against Han rule and ethnic policies? Has the P.R.C been justified in using Ghulja as a peg on which to hang it's "War on terror" against the Uygur? Did the moment of "glory" for the Uygur people mark also the commencement of a programme that would eventually crush it's collective will and provide for their ultimate "defeat"?  I am currently researching an article where I hope to bring together interviews with real people at the scene at the time as well as wade through the propaganda and conflicting reports that have come out of the incident  so as to make some sense of what actually happened and its ramifications for the Uygur people. With a little luck this will be appearing in "The Uygur Letter" very soon.    Changes   To those who have visited "The Uygur Letter" before you may notice some changes to the look and format. One is the introduction of the "Blog Roll" which allows you access to all the information I source on a daily basis through my RSS feeds.

Absolutely incredible why not give a go?   An Anniversary: When do The Uygurs and Tibetans  pop the Champagne?   An interesting anniversary has just passed, that of 25 years since US diplomatic ties with China were restored. Who would have believed how time flies?   For a walk down memory lane from the PRC's perspective go to the   urlLink Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the PRC    The Face in the Photo    I have spoke of the planned piece on Ghulja and the update to the look of the site. Some may have noticed a picture of a man behind bars at the top right of the page.  This man is Abduhelil Abdulmejit and he was considered by the Chinese to be the Chief Organiser of the Ghulja Riots.  Abduhelil Abdulmejit organized social gatherings started by Uygurs in Ghulja in 1994 to combat widespreaddrug abuse and social problems among youths. Authorities banned the gatherings in 1995, apparently fearing their growing strength.  Married with three children, Abduhelil Abdulmejit was arrested immediately after the riots in Ghila and spent 44 months behind bars suffering it is claimed by such sources as Amnesty International continuous torture and deprivations.  Unfortunately Abdhur died in 2001 supposedly of "pneumonia" whilst in a Chinese prison and was unceremoniously buried without his relatives getting access to the body or the grave.   Following is  an AP 2001 report concerning  ETIC and Amnesty International claims regarding Abdhur and his treatment at the hands of the PRC.    China Protest Leader Said Tortured   By JOHN LEICESTER, Associated Press Writer  BEIJING (AP) - Police have tortured to death an organizer of one of the largest uprisings against Chinese rule in China's restive Muslim northwest, according to a separatist group.  Abduhelil Abdulmejit, imprisoned 44 months ago and repeatedly interrogated and tortured, died Oct. 17 in the Chapchal Su Detention Center in the Xinjiang region's Yili county, said the East Turkistan Information Center, based in Germany.  A detention center official confirmed Abduhelil Abdulmejit's death but said he died from pneumonia at the central prison in Yining, Yili's county seat, not at the detention center. The official, reached by telephone Tuesday, did not provide other details or his name. An official at the Yining prison refused to comment.  The Information Center said police buried Abduhelil Abdulmejit in prison clothes in a shallow grave in Chapchal. His relatives and friends have not been allowed to visit the grave, the center said in a report posted Saturday on its Web site.  The center is one of many overseas groups demanding independence for Xinjiang and its dominant ethnic group, the Uighurs. It described Abduhelil Abdulmejit as ``chief organizer'' of Uighur protests that shook Yining - a city near China's border with Kazakstan - in February 1997.  Hundreds took to the streets shouting ``God is great'' and ``Independence for Xinjiang'' on Feb. 5. Police and soldiers moved in and two days of beating, shooting and burning ensued.  By the government's count, 10 people died. Uighur exile groups contend that at least 100 died and that security forces used water cannons, tear gas and bullets to end the protests. Amnesty International estimated that in the two weeks following the protests 3,000 to 5,000 people were arrested.  Uighurs declared a short-lived East Turkistan Republic in Xinjiang in the last years of World War II, but the region has been firmly in Chinese hands since the Communist Party seized power in 1949. Militant Uighurs have in recent years carried out a campaign of bombing and assassinations against Chinese rule.  Amnesty International reported last year that Abduhelil Abdulmejit organized social gatherings started by Uighurs in Yining in 1994 to combat widespread drug abuse and social problems among youths. Authorities banned the gatherings in 1995, apparently fearing their growing strength, Amnesty said.  Married with three children, Abduhelil Abdulmejit was arrested immediately after the demonstrations erupted in Yining, the Amnesty report said.  Citing unofficial sources, the report said prison guards made him face a wall with arms raised while they beat him, set a dog on him and tortured him.  In a statement Tuesday on news of his death, London-based Amnesty said Abduhelil Abdulmejit's case was typical and highlighted ``the urgent need for international action on torture.''  China's government acknowledges that torture occurs in prisons and police stations but says it does not condone it and is trying to stop it.       ===========================================================  The Uygur (Uighur) of Xinjiang need the support of the world in the attainment of basic human rights.

						     China is a huge place, of that there is no doubt. With over 1.3 billion people it faces enormous pressures and challenges that only the people of Asia and the subcontinent can truly understand.  This was brought home to me again recently when talking to a Kazakh friend of mine in Shanghai  about the Avarian “Bird” disease currently threatening China. All this very intelligent and educated man could offer as to the why’s and where’s was the intonation “too many people, too many people”  This ‘analysis” may sound simplistic to the scientists and medical experts who attempt to understand and contain the spread of this disease but, sometimes, simple analysis is best.  China has huge problems as a result of population pressure. People need to be fed, employed, clothed, warmed, transported and made to feel secure. As the P.R.C. officials have said on countless occasions, in part justification of it’s Human Rights record, is that the idea of widespread unrest and lawlessness in a country with the population the size of China’s is unthinkable.  China is starving for fuel, it is short of many resources, it is sinking in it’s own pollution, hygiene is poor and it’s environment and natural resources are being degraded at a rapid rate. The threat of Avarian disease, SARS or any number of untold other diseases is very, very real.  Add to this the challenge of having 56 ethnic groups within it’s boundaries and large representations of the major world religions, often than not, very different in ideology and outlook to each other.  The sum result is an unbelievable challenge for any government and, one that you can not help but think, would be beyond the capabilities of a totally democratic government in the Westminster style.  As commentators and analysts, especially those of us with a Human Rights bent, we can so easily fall into the trap of, for want of better words, “China Bashing”.  That very comfortable zone where it is easy to provide criticism but rarely put forward solutions.  The P.R.C. say that we are witnessing the birth of a “New China”, a China that will take her place in the world as an equal and be able to hold her head high in the company of her peers.  Certainly her rhetoric is there and sometimes we must state our goals before they can be realised. There is a time delay between when we say “we are going to” and the time we can say “we have done”  I think we must accept that China does truly wish to evolve. Students of International Politics and followers of  Machiavellian theories can and will offer arguments to the contrary, of that I am certain. As wise people we must listen to their arguments. It is certainly not unknown in history that nation states can say one thing and mean another, something Neville Chamberlain learnt to his eternal chagrin..  But if we work on the premise that this is a true and genuine intention on behalf of the P.R.C. then we must act differently. We must give the benefit of the doubt.  But like a New Years Resolution we sometimes need a little egging on or, even, not so gentle reminders as to our flagging resolve or lack of urgency.   Despite our being able to emphasise with China’s unique problems we must still maintain the pressure on China over human rights violations and remind her, as a friend would, of her resolutions and pronouncements.  Yes!  China we understand your difficulties, we emphasise with the challenges you face and the difficulty of the job at hand. We realise that the Titanic can not be turned on a sixpence, that in many echelons below your Politburo there are people very set in their ways.  But China, you must sometimes give before you receive. You must be seen to be at least trying and unfortunately, in the area of Human Rights, you are still not seen to be.  We want to welcome you into our bosom but you can not expect to be received as an equal when you maintain your programmes of oppression, victimisation and worse against the likes of the Uygurs and the Tibetans.   China, how can you expect us to shake your hand as a friend when it continues to be sullied with the blood of your peoples?               The Uygur (Uighur) of Xinjiang need the support of the world in the attainment of basic human rights.

						     urlLink China: Criminal Charges Misused to Target Tibetans (Human Rights Watch, 9-2-2004)    The Chinese methodology to quell dissent obviously is consistent in it's application if nothing else.  The above story is of of Tenzin Delek, a Tibetan Monk given a commuted death sentence for 'splittism" and other charges and his story is so typical texbook stuff that I am sure there really does exists one and is handed out to all levels of officialdom.  The Textbook on "Handling Dissenters at Local Level"  goes something like this.  Chapter 1  In the case of minor first time dissent     Identify the individual who is criticising the state   Lean heavily on him to desist   Put a warning out by leaning on his friends, relatives and associates   Harass the said individual constantly over minor things such as whose pictures he has or does not have on his wall at home. (N.B. Imperative that Mao's photo take precedence over God's.)   Give him a taste of jail a couple of times over some trumped up matters. (N.B. Publicise this heavily)   Jail some friends or relatives. (Footnote: Whereas someone may disregard his own welfare it is harder for him to ignore what is happening to those close by him. Effectiveness rating 8/10)    Chapter 2 Hard Nuts  If the said dissenter continues after all avenues in Chapter 1 are exhausted please refer to chapter 2      Accuse dissenter of one of the following: "Splittism" "Terrorism" "endangering National Security".   Accuse said individual and any one (number is at the discetion of local leaders) of his friends of letting off a bomb (in the event you have used this too much in your prefecture recently please feel free to accuse him of "Mass Poisoning".    Conduct closed door trial in the interests of "National Security" (N.B. Do not publicise proceedings)   Sentence both to death and execute "co-conspirator"  immediately   Show the benevolence of the State by commuting said dissenters sentence to life imprisonment. This serves the added purpose of dissuading others who may wish to follow him.    The case of the Tibetan monk as set out in the Human Rights Watch article is mirrored countless times with others throughout China.   The Uygur ethnic minority of Xinjiang are treated in exactly the same manner day in and day out.   The terms "splittist" "terrorist" "bomb maker" "poisoner" et al are bandied about with such gay abandon by officialdom that they must have pre prepared templates. "Choose a category and insert name...."  But the bottom line is, and we must never lose sight of it even though we may employ the device of parody in highlighting it, is that this is happening on a daily basis to thousands within China.     Real people are made to suffer real fear, real deprivations and ,all to often very real death.

						     urlLink TheStar.com - We had no rights: Acrobats     What a wonderful story.           Picture courtesy of the "Star" Uygur Defectors In Toronto     Seven members of the Uygur ethnic minority of Xinjiang China on a  Chinese organised cultural touring party to Canada left their minders and presented themselves to Canadian officials claiming asylum and seeking refugee status.   The seven, were all members of an official Chinese acrobatic troupe visiting Canada for the Chinese New Year celebrations.   In scenes reminiscent of the Cold War the group clandestinely contacted the local Uygur emigre community and, after having to spell out the name on a nearby football stadium to identify their location, organised their mercy dash for freedom with a no doubt amazed local Uygur.   Later that day  whilst their minders were not looking the group rushed to a waiting getaway car and sped off to a possible new life and freedom in Canada.  "We were very afraid and we could hear each other's heartbeats when we got in the (getaway) car," a group member named Sirajidin told the Canadian Star Newspaper.   The seven, five men and two women are a part of the minority Uygur ethnic group of Xinjiang an “autonomous” region in China’s north west.  The Uygur are a Caucasian, Muslim peoples of Turkic origin numbering some 8.5 million in China and have for long been a victim of gross human rights violations including restrictions on basic freedom of association and religion, false imprisonment and even executions.  Since "9/11" the Chinese have used the "War on Terror" to mask even greater privations aimed at breaking the will of the Uygur who, for a period in the 1990's, showed a desire to follow their "Turkic brothers" of the former Soviet Central Asian states in achieving independence.   Under the guise of the "War on Terror", the People's Republic of China have cracked down harshly on any form of dissent by the Uygur in Xinjiang. Human rights groups such as Amnesty International have chronicled numerous incidences of false imprisonment, torture and executions whilst the Chinese attempt to portray to the world that, apart from some “Uygur terrorist” activity, all is well among the ethnic groups of its far north west region.   "We performed for the government and they used us to create this image of ethnic unity. We didn't have a choice. We had no right to oppose," juggler Dilshat Sirajidin told the "Star Newspaper"  The Star goes on to report that yesterday the acrobats were “greeted like heroes” by the entire Uygur community of Toronto at a local restaurant. Most of the close knit Uygur family of Canada are themselves exiles who fled what they called "political persecutions and ethnic discrimination” the Star reported further.  But Toronto was not the only place for Uygurs to be celebrating.   Uygur Internet forums and chat rooms were awash with news of the defections. It brought with it cheers and congratulations and a strange new lease of life among the Uygur in diaspora who plod on relentlessly in the hope of getting the wider world to pay attention to the plight of their brothers in China.  The defections could have not come at a better time for those Uygur as recently reporting of the Uygur situation had increased markedly in the world media perhaps breathing new hope in lungs tired from calling in the wilderness.  Rudolph Nureyevs they may not be but something tells me this group of Uygur performers may have just completed their best show.

						    urlLink 3 arrested for bombing Chinese restaurants in Australia   Part 2  They must be really short of news in China as the story of the Perth West Australian deranged teenager who painted swastikas on three Perth Chinese restaurants has surfaced again.  This earth shattering event has been headline news now on two occasions in the official news organ of the People's Republic of China, the "Peoples Daily".  The story has livened up with the appearance in court of a total of three men being charged for aggravated burglary  The beauty of this story update is the final paragraph and I quote  "Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio reported Saturday that police will continue to investigate whether the three are involved with an  organized group , (my emphasis) although Western Australian police Commissioner Barry Matthews said it is unlikely."  The Chinese government appears to love a good conspiracy theory don't they? One sometimes think that they are suffering some sort of collective persecution complex.  On a different note I had the opportunity to take the family into Sydney's Chinatown for lunch today  and a look around ( I actually like Chinese food and Chinese people) and we were confronted with a booth of people protesting the PRC's treatment of the  urlLink Falun Gong group. The graphic images displayed of alleged torture victims was disturbing to say the least.   Whilst I know very little about this group the pictures were very reminiscent of ones I have seen of Uygur people after Chinese officials had "interviewed" them.  When will the Chinese government realise that they can not be taken seriously as the "New China" whilst images like this float around the world?

						     urlLink The Record    In China's crackdown on the freedoms and rights of the Uygur people of Xinjiang it has used as it's major excuse to the world that it is doing so in the cause of the "War on Terrorism". The PRC have stated ad nauseum (and sometimes with great contradictions) that the Uygur harbour large and well organised terrorist organisations which threaten the peace not only of China but internationally as well.  The news report above finally gives some numbers and nationalities to the 650 odd detainees in Guantanamo Bay. It claims that there are twelve identified Uygurs among the 650 detainees in Guantanamo. This represents less than 2% of the total. (By way of comparison Britain has nine and Australia and Canada have two apiece).  Finally, these figures give some credence to a point I have made many times, and that is, if there was such a strong and organised international Uygur terrorist movement active in China and abroad during the Taliban period, why were so few caught in Afghanistan?  Surely, given Xinjiang's proximity to Afghanistan, given the Muslim affinity and given what some would say were very comprehensible (if not justifiable) reasons for "Uygur terrorists" to align themselves with the Taliban and Al Qaeda,  one would expect a sizeable presence of Uygur "terrorists" among the 650 captured.  There are no "internationally/UN recognised" British terrorist organisations but they managed to have nine caught (and Britain is just a little farther away than Xinjiang). Another example is Jordan an ally of the US that has THIRTY representatives!  The Chinese have claimed on numerous occasions that there were one thousand Uygurs trained by the Taliban and Al qaeda in Afghanistan. They further claim that there were close connections between Bin Laden and the East Turkistan Islamic Party (ETIM) the "organisation" listed by the US and UN as an international terrorist organisation at the insistence of China.  I keep getting back to the thought that  if I were the leader of a well organised, effective and growing terrorist organisation, and, I was within walking distance of people and groups that could train, equip and fund my operatives, then I would have sent them to Afghanistan and in significant numbers.  Uygur leaders and commentators in diaspora have long attempted to refute the PRC's claim as to the existence of an extensive Uygur terrorist apparatus. It is interesting  to note that the number caught pretty much reflects their previous assessments of there being no more than fifty to eighty Uygur  involved with the Taliban forces in Afghanistan  I am sure that someone is going to say that the Uygurs were probably able to slip back into Xinjiang or were able to easily blend in with the local populace and thus avoid detection, and, yes, this I would have to agree is a possibility. But so could a lot of the others have done the same, the Saudis for example. No, I think that it is reasonable to assume that relative numbers caught or escaped will have been pretty much the same for any Arab/Turkic looking people.  Where does this leave the PRC and their claims, and, the "Free Nations" that have supported them by turning a blind eye to their policies and actions?   Well, I think that the mask of the "War on Terrorism" used to hide PRC's continued violations of the Uygur's human rights has well and truly slipped to fully reveal the face of outright duplicity. In looking into that face the "free world" must now finally be able to see see that it has been well and truly conned.

						     urlLink TheStar.com - Chinese acrobats seek refugee status    Yes it is a fine line that the Chinese Government walk when they let their happy nationals out of the country on "cultural Exchange" programmes. It must be a  real balancing act for them to decide whether to let them out or not in the first place given the recent happenings in Canada.  The above refers to a Canadian newspaper report that several "Chinese" Uygurs from an acrobatic and tight rope walking group on cultural exchange trip to Canada have left the straight and narrow and tumbled right into the arms of the Canadian Government seeking refugee status.  All poor attempts at puns aside the main point is that several Uygurs who were representing China have sort political asylum in Canada and that must say something.  I do not recall too many people from Australia, the US or other "free countries" having to seek political asylum to prevent them from being returned to the bosom of the homeland where they are happy and contented. These performers to boot would have been receiving preferential treatment in China because of their positions so, if they did not like it, than what must it be like for the average Uygur in Xinjiang.  I trust that the Canadian officials recognise that they are true political refugees and that if they were, for whatever reason deported back to China, that there fate would be at least a long jail term if not worse.  A few less lives for the PRC to juggle with.

						    urlLink Australian PM: Racist attacks 'disgraceful'    The above article appeared today as headline news in the China Daily and the People's Daily both Chinese state run news agencies.   Essentially it concerns an allegedly mentally deranged youth who drew swastika images on the walls of several Chinese Restaurants in some outer suburbs of Perth, a smaller Australian state capitol city.  It is of no doubt that it was racially motivated whether against the Chinese in particular we do not know. (There are very few other ethnic restaurants in these outer suburbs).  Whilst of course the act must be deplored it must also be put into some degree of context. Does it warrant sub headline news in the aforementioned publications? I would think not. I would not even rate it for a place on page 150.  When we look at the acts of blatant "racism" being conducted on a day to day basis against the Caucasian Turkic Uygur minority in Xinjiang China it is even harder to understand it's importance.  It appears to me that whenever there is any criticism in the world press about China's treatment of it's ethnic minorities that the PRC finds some issue to report as if to say "He who is in glass houses..." But are we not scraping the barrow with this one?   Recently there has been several articles appearing in the world press suggesting that China's neighbours in the Turkic Republics are cracking down on their Uygur populations in response to China's pressure and or financial inducements. From out of nowhere in the last couple of days appears an article released by the Krygyzstan authorities naming two Uyghur men as being responsible for a bus atrocity in Bishkek in March last year. urlLink News Scotsman 3/2/04   This is despite the same authorities having ruled out Uyghur complicity in the crime  urlLink Uighur-L List  mid of last year. (the crime by the way was the slaughter of 21 ethnic Uygurs on a bus in Bishkek in March 2003, hardly one would think the act of "Uygur extremists" supposedly fighting on behalf of their brothers in Xinjiang)  I am not saying that in this particular instance the PRC pressured the Krygyz authorities but it does seem rather coincidental.  If you watch these two Dailys I am sure that you will see that this pattern of reaction is quite obvious and in many cases contradictory to what has been said before. It is almost childish in it's lack of political understanding and maturity.   By gosh most people would not know where Australia was let alone the outer suburbs of Perth and one poor mentally ill youth has found himself to be almost an international incident for a day.

						    urlLink 35 Days In East turkistan Article"T     When one supports a cause from afar one can be forgiven for those occasional quiet moments, late at night, sitting alone in front of a computer screen, when he thinks to himself  "Is it all worth it? What difference can my small 'blog' or websites or forum posts or  "Letters to the Editor" make?   Then you read the detractors who accuse you of "China bashing".   "Does not China, after all, have 1.3 billion people to worry about?" they say  "Must not that the rights of a small minority come behind the welfare of such a huge mass of humanity?"  "Anyway" they intone "the Uygur people are happy, their position is much better today than in previous years"   The doubts can come to one far from Xinjiang and the peoples he admires so much. After all even the "official" Uygur organisations on the web are far less active then they were a couple of years ago. Their message boards are getting thinner, the "Latest News From Xinjiang" is very late in deed, not in time line but in age.  Then you read an article like the one cited above and you feel the stirring once again, nay a strong emotion, one that does not just stir but jumps inside your heart. Then you remember why you do it and all of a sudden your small "blog" is important for if there were but 100 small "blogs"....? if there were a few more posts to message boards...? if the Uygur organisations dusted themselves off and realised that inertia had set in and say "hey I remember why I did this originally, lets do it again with the same fervour" then things can be changed.  We may have forgotten the life the Uygur of Xinjiang must live but I can assure you they have not. We may no longer be as attuned to the daily deprivations of life and liberty they must live under, they will have not. When you read this sitting at your computer you will not have the Internet Cafe owner looking over your shoulder ready to report you, they do.   We may have forgotten them but they will not have forgotten us, they will not have forgotten the promises we made so boldly from our warm heaths in Munich, Istanbul and Washington in the heady days after Gulja and the ensuing executions and mass detentions.  I thank the authoress of this article for the re-enforcement it has provided me and I admire her courage for going back and doing what she did. Now, if we can only "go back" and do what we have to do, that is to maintain peaceful but consistent pressure on the PRC to achieve basic human rights and cultural self determination for the Uygur people of Xinjiang.  Let us show them that we have not forgotten them after all.

						    The Uygur (Uighur) of Xinjiang need the support of the world in the attainment of basic human rights. This blog of news commentary and analysis hopes to add to pressure on the People's Republic of China to bring about positive change. ========================================================  Today I decided to enter into the world of RSS feeds. Don't ask me too much about it because I am not too sure myself. All I know is that it is supposed to allow people to be made instantly aware of any new posts which I make.   To use computer terminology my RSS is still in it's beta testing stage.   Anyway it was in exploring this "new" technology the I came across "The Argus" (see link to right) run by whom I assume to be a young American named Nathan. It is a blog dedicated to Central Asia and Nathan had referred to an article of mine in one of his posts that had been picked up by "Media Monitors" and then "Google News".  Nathan is very much pro Uygur and it is good to see another "blogger" who is interested in the fate of our friends the Uygur of Xinjiang. I look forward to reading more of Nathan's musings. Good luck Nathan.

To try to even do that means mines are working when they should be closed down due to safety reasons.   Upwards to 10,000 Chinese per annum lose their lives working in " Dickensian " conditions may others are injured or crippled and The EU wants more coke ?  Do these people not read papers?

						     urlLink  ABC News Online :      "Australians are being asked to comment on the idea of a free trade agreement (FTA) with China.  A trade and economic framework signed by Beijing and Canberra last October calls for a feasibility study of an FTA.  A task force created by Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has called for public submissions and comment on a free trade treaty with China.  The task force says it will consult business, interested organisations, the public and state and territory governments.  The study is to be completed by October next year."    So reports the Australian Broadcasting Commission. At last this is the type of dialogue needed, to allow individuals and NGO's some input into whom and how we trade with China.  I maintain that trade with China benefits everyone if it is done responsibly and that human rights concerns are taken into consideration.   That we use the economic bargaining table not to just count money but to help elicit change.

						     urlLink VOANews.com     The reports of the arrest of three woman associated with the  urlLink Tiananmen Mothers  protest group is more evidence that, more often than not, the tail wags the dog in China and points to one of the major problems facing the Chinese government.  On Tuesday the Chinese Government released a "White Paper" on China's Human Rights initiatives. This "White Paper" was released in response to continued criticism of China's Human Rights record and, particularly, to counter a resolution by the United States, concerning China's Rights record, at the currently in progress United Nations Human Rights Commission .  The "White Paper" was not something that was thrown together over night. It was obviously carefully put together in anticipation of the U.S's resolution and released at the opportune time. One would have expected that major organs of state would have expected it.  It is a detailed document in some respects especially concerning the great strides China has made economically and the flow on effects to the living standards of the people. It proudly boasts massive increases in such things as private car ownership and mobile phone usage.  China sets great store on the "welfare" of the people as a whole being the litmus test for the effectiveness of it's policies on Human Rights. They believe that given China's population and unique set of circumstances that  benchmarks used by the west are inappropriate as far as China is concerned. The individual's rights are subordinate to the whole.  With this philosophy they can almost blissfully, like an innocent child, give to the world this self generated report card and seem to honestly believe that they are in a good position. And, to a degree they are.  Recently the National People's Conference voted to enshrine  the concept of Human Rights in the Constitution. It is hardly a specific clause and falls short of providing any real legal remedies to anyone feeling they have been denied their "constitutional rights". It is, however, an important and historical step. As the Chinese government point out the passing of this constitutional amendment  recognises formally the " concept " of Human Rights at the highest level. By becoming a part of the Constitution it becomes a " Guiding Principle " by which all strata of government should be guided in all that they do.  And this is all very well and good but this incident over the Tiananmen Mothers and many other incidences too numerous to recount point quite clearly to the fact that whilst the "head" is thinking one thing the "body" is doing something else.    Given the importance of this document and the very specific timing of it's release how could a thing like this arrest occur? Why would the Government allow an opportunity for the world to, once again, point an accusing finger at what, without doubt, has been the most controversial example of China's lack of respect for Human Rights bar none. And, to cap it off, it arrests  mothers  in their late 60's who are still, like anyone would be, devastated by the loss of their children and husbands.  Combine with that the fact that the resolution this "White Paper" is meant to draw heat from is a tradition of the Americans that   commenced with  the Tiananmen Square massacre> Given this fact one would have thought some planning would have gone into it's release.  And surely it can not be lost on the Chinese that when the majority of the world thinks human rights in China it thinks two things : Tiananmen  and  Tibet . Why didn't they just go for a double and burn down some Tibetan Buddhist temples as well, it could not have made matters any worse!  This is evidence that in China the " tail wags the dog ". Time and time again we are confronted with the sight of China taking two steps forward and one step back. The reason is because at the lower levels of the government apparatus and judiciary they run their own race. They appear to operate in a  Mao time warp   oblivious to the direction of the top. They still appear  to pursue the old party line and there does not seem to be any degree of accountability whatsoever.  Imagine, if you will, a thing like this happening in the West. Blood would be bayed for, heads would roll at the highest level. But no, not the Chinese.  urlLink Premier Wen Jiabao  and  urlLink  President Hu Jintao  would probably now be climbing the walls and tearing their hair out. If they are not then they should be.  In one foul swoop the positives that could have been garnered out of this "White Paper" release have been almost destroyed. I say almost because the number of news articles appearing on the "White Paper" far outnumber those on the mothers arrest.  Change in China must be effected from the bottom as well as the top and meet in the midde. China must instigate policies that allow for more accountability and transparency and this accountability must extend all the way to the top. China's cancer- like official corruption problem is but another example of this lack of oversight, accountability and transparency.  In the west accountability is aided by elections, a free press and the right to protest and dissent. If China will not allow such things then it must have a system to provide it alternatively and that must come from a strong government. Firm within itself   Until China can do this it will always will encounter these types of problems and the head can say and think what it likes but the tail will wag along independently and happily.

						     urlLink :: Xinhuanet - English ::     Well, as stated in my previous post the "surprise" "White Paper" on China's Human Rights progress is now available in it's full text copy on  Xinhuanet .  The link above goes through a proxy as Xinhua block me from seeing their site so you might, if you want to take a look at it yourself, go directly to Xinuanet. The proxy is a little slow to say the least.  Well the "White Paper" is a big document of that there is no doubt. Like all the PRC's official responses to criticism, be it a press release through Xinhua or the more formal "White Papers", this has obviously been prepared for some time even though it's publication was only announced yesterday.  There is no doubt that this is China shifting into full "justification" mode. It is detailed, at least to the economic statistics, and it leaves virtually no stone unturned. We learn about the " Measures for the sheltering and send off of urban vagrants and beggars'  law being replaced by the " Measures for assisting and managing urban vagrants and beggars" law which we are told provides for far greater treatment of homeless and beggars. I point this out not because it is not an important law change in itself but one hardly of import given some other areas of human rights shortfalls. (This law, by the way, has actually been put into practice and beggars/vagrants are now by all reports treated with a little more humanity than previously).  The PRC realises one thing and that is that when you talk statistics in China it is mind boggling to us in the west. They therefore use statistics to "sell" the idea that they are faced with situations that western countries could not imagine. In doing so they are saying that " our  position is unique so please cut us some slack on Human rights ".  This argument certainly is not without merit. The sheer size of everything they do is astounding. Some of the figures they rattled off are      Private car ownership in 2003 was 4.89 million vehicles up 1.46 million on the previous year. That is right,  1.46 million. Astounding.   Mobile phone ownership increased by 62.69 million units 2003 over 2002 to a total of 286.69 million.   49.08 million new household telephone connections happened in 2003   Private dwelling construction rose 20% in the last few years and 72% of urban dwellings are now privately owned. 94% of all new private dwelling construction in urban areas is destined for private ownership   The "White Paper"  has literally hundreds of similar examples covering virtually every aspect of China life and they  are  all very impressive.  There is no doubt that things are moving in the right direction if even half the data is correct.   Ethnic Minorities   Given the size of China's ethnic minority groups and the unique problems they face, for example the Uygurs and the Tibetans, the "White Paper" dwells vey little on this important subject.  It talks about religious freedoms, growth in the numbers of clerics and places of worship and even the size of the print run of the  Bible . However the extent of what they say on this important subject can be summed up in the following quote:    Ethnic minorities enjoy " the rights to independently manage the affairs of their own regions and their own ethnic communities"    I wonder what your average Tibetan or Uygur would say to that? Quite frankly to call a "spade" a "bloody shovel" this statement is an outright lie, I can use no more diplomatic a term.   The Uygur and the Tibetans have no say in the management of "their regions" and the management of "their own ethnic minorities" is also almost non existent. They may for example have the "right" to manage their own religious culture to a degree but the rules by which they have to abide are firmly laid down by the government regardless of the wishes of the minority.  We could go on and on but suffice to say the "White Paper" " whitewashes " the ethnic human rights situation in terms both the space given over to it in this document and in terms of facts.  As I said it is an expansive document. To sum up, for the avid " China Watchers " it provides some very good detail and gives a very real an insight in to what the Party sees as being important as regards Human Rights.   For the average person, maybe not so close to the reality that is China, it would certainly provide a "warm feeling" that things are going in the right direction. Statistics often do that.  It does evidence progress in a lot of areas of that there can be no doubt, but is very much a case of the  Beggar and the Uygur . The beggar is treated humanely and his treatment is hailed as a wonderful step forward for the cause of Human Rights in China. The Uygur, on the other hand, maligned and abused through none of their own fault, are not even mentioned and ethnic problems generally have not anywhere near adequately been addressed. The Chinese see the small picture but are blind to the larger at least where Human Rights is concerned.   Linked Article Read Rating : A Must

						     urlLink  Yahoo! :      "China has issued a white paper on its human rights achievements in the past year, admitting a poor record but pledging to improve human rights protections in the nation of 1.3 billion people."    The article goes on to say that much of China's recent rights progress cited in the  40-page paper  was attributed to amendments added earlier this month to China's  constitution including wording that "the state respects and safeguards human rights" and an amendment on protecting private property.  I have not seen the document yet but the Yahoo report says that the Chinese believe freedom of speech, religion and the press all witnessed improved protections during the past year but did not provide any detail to back up the claim  The Yahoo report goes on to say, not unexpectedly, that much of the  white paper  appeared written exclusively for foreign consumption with information selectively used and placed solidly within the context of rights improvements.  China is very predictable in the way it handles criticism as there is always some response either through Xinhua or the People's Daily. A "white Paper" its usually reserved for things considered greatly important. Previous White Papers have been about Xinjiang and the Uygur and one on Tibet.  I am off to find the original.

						     urlLink China Daily :      I am constantly amazed as to the things the  China Daily   can come out with.   In these times of internet censorship by the Chinese government I am often caught scrolling up to the masthead of the China Daily site just to reassure myself that that is where I am.  Today is no exception. Here I am going through news stories and I find one that says the following:    "China and India both watched the launch of the US war on terrorism with unease. Admittedly, each has found a way of benefiting from it. China made the US include Uighur militants in Xinjiang in the general condemnation; India made sure Kashmiri militants were generally condemned too."    I think to myself I am on the China Daily site aren't I? One of the top five Chinese news sources? The one with the nice "new China" touch of trying to "flog" a chart of the Communist Party on it's front page.  Then why am I reading an article that says effectively that China  benefited  from the " War on Terror " because it got the U.S. to "Include Uighur Militants in the general condemnation"  Is this an admittance that the crackdown on  urlLink  Xinjiang's Uygurs    is being carried out because China  benefited  from the  "War On Terror" ?  How else would they  benefit  unless because their crackdown on the Uygurs would have been widely criticised otherwise?    "Admittedly each has found a way of benefiting from it"     Is anyone supposed to benefit from the "War on terror" other than people? People who will not have to live in fear or be injured or die? I did not think countries were in this to benefit from anything else, openly at least!  Perhaps a Freudian slip on behalf of the journalist and editors. One thing about keeping up a lie is that you have to have a good memory. Sometimes I think the China Daily forgets who it is writing for.   Linked Article Read Rating : Worthwhile

Essentially wheat production has been falling quite dramatically for some years now and for a variety of reasons. In this article the Politburo is reported to have  talked about increasing of rural incomes as one measure to attack the problem, but this only goes so far because  a) average land plots are too small to be efficient and b) state ownership of property is a disincentive for private capital investment needed to agglomerate holdings and capitalise production.  Increasing rural incomes may alleviate poverty and go some way to decreasing the growing disparities in wealth between urbanites and country people but it will not grow anymore wheat.

As urban incomes skyrocket rural incomes continue to decline relative to the cities. The linked articles talks to some farmers about the ways they make ends meet, usually by holding down other jobs or being involved in small business.  China's wheat crops are in decline and have been for some years (see post below) and there are many reasons and the one mentioned by Shi is only one albeit an important one.  In a modern era small farm lots are not economic or efficient. Plots of the size mentioned in the article ( 3.5 hectares) are ridiculous for most commercial crops let alone wheat. Economies of scale just are not there.  Also state ownership of land is holding back production. The article quotes one farmer saying what he would do with the land to improve it if he owned it. He states he is not going to spend his hard earned money adding value to and improving the land if he does not own it.  Agrarian reform is going to be a huge task for the Chinese Government. Until there is private ownership of property farmers will not invest and farm sizes will not change to allow for increased efficiencies.    Linked Article Read Rating : Worthwhile

"    In an interesting turn of events China is to publish one of it's famous " White Papers " on it's Human Rights progress,  assured by the People's Daily to be packed solid of facts and figures.  These " White Papers " are usually self jusifying documents that are heavily "weighted" (to put a diplomatic spin on it) towards China's point of view. Early last year the PRC put out a urlLink "White Paper"  on  urlLink  Xinjiang  (read Uygur) in response to growing criticism of their attacks on Uygur freedoms and liberties under the guise of the " War On Terror " Whilst a good document generally in terms of facts and figures it tended to do a bit of history re-write.

If that is born in mind then they can be very useful particularly in giving insight into the Chinese mindset on a particular topic.  I await this one eagerly.

						     urlLink Reporters sans frontires - China :      Reporters without Frontiers  claim that the recent arrests and jailing of journalist was a plot by the Chinese Government to deter others from overstepping the mark on criticising the regime.    "the plot aimed to keep Chinese journalists in a state of fear, it said. 'While the Communist Party boasts of having included protection of private property in the Constitution, press bosses and journalists are sentenced to heavy jail terms for having turned their daily into an independent and going concern,' said Reporters Without Borders. "    It would appear from the article that the Chinese Government has taken exception to the journalistic and editorial team of the weekly newspaper  Nanfang Dushi Bao  whose jailing, so supporters claim, was linked to their revelations on the Sars virus and the death of a young graphic artist who was beaten to death in a police station.  The official charges were "corruption" embezzlement" and "appropriating State Property" and related to them "receiving" money from the paper. The fact of the matter  was not denied in court but defended as normal practice in the Chinese newspaper industry which  Reporters Without Frontiers  claim to have confirmed is the case.  Such cases are hard to ajudge from afar. Because one is a defender of Human Rights does not mean ergo that one is above putting one's hands in the till.  We must applaud bravery in journalism but also applaud the Chinese  taking strong action to stamp out corruption in state run industries (which all newspapers are) and among state officials Such  practices  are rife in China officialdom and have a major impact on individual human rights as can be seen in the many cases of forced evictions prompted with a greased palm. Which catagory this falls into I hesitate to call.  In cases like this we can only look for patterns and hold back from drawing unfounded conclusions in isolation.

In the mud-brick village encircling the Baixing coal mine, so many lives had ended already with an explosion deep in a hole that it seemed part of the regular flow of time."    China's coal mining industry kills up to 10,000 miners per year. Most deaths happen in small private mines that operate with little official scrutiny, many operate illegally but are conveniently ignored by graft hungry officials.  China knows it is a huge problem but what can she do? Coal is vital to the economic miracle that is modern China. It is relied on for up to 75% of energy needs. The economy churns forward fueled by the deaths of so many scraping the black deposits from dark and dangerous mine shafts. Last year  urlLink Premier Wen Jaibao  called for strict policies to curb the death toll. Within weeks the nation was in a mess, homes were going without heating as production fell dramatically. It could not be sustained so the "crackdown" was lifted.   The linked article brings a small insight in to the human face of mining deaths.    He had to go to the mine, said Li Guixiang, whose husband, Xi Chuancai, was among the dead. Five months earlier, Xia's older brother died in an explosion at a nearby mine. Another brother lost both legs when a shaft caved in four years ago. Lia's neighbor, Liang Shouhua, sat beside her, mourning the loss of her own husband, the third of three brothers to die in a mining explosion.   If they didnt do this job, they wouldnt have any money for living, Li said. You have to eat.     The coal mining industry can not be shutdown to fix this problem, the nation needs it's output too much. But China has a  responsibility to it's workers . The problem will only worsen as production is pushed harder and enormous annual growth rates are demanded by this burgeoning economy.  China has to start throwing some serious money at the problem. It has to develop a strategy were the industry can still function but is gone through with a fine tooth comb. China needs more than just the couple of thousand mine inspectors that it currentl has monitoring 200,000+ sites. It needs to ask for help from the international community to supply experts to assist in bringing down a death rate that is 350 times greater than the U.S, Britain or Australia, other large coal producing countries. It needs perhaps the international mining countries to supply coal on a  Lend Lease  type of arrangement to take the pressure off demand to allow programmed closedowns and rectification.   It just needs action not words.    Linked Article Read Rating:  Worthwhile

						     urlLink >>> AsiaNews.it  :       "....on Feb. 8 the government had increased public financing of farmland to around 3 billion dollars, a 25% overall increase, as part of a rare emergency financial measure. Such state provisions signal a growing alarm over a potential food emergency, especially in terms of the country's growing need for grain.  "    In 1950 grain production in China was 90 million tons. In 1998 it reached a record of 329 million tons. In 2003 this had declined to 323 million. To put it in perspective the amount decline equaled the total production of Canada, itself a leading world grower.  The ability of China to feed itself into the future is in serious doubt as wheat is not the only crop suffering declines in a nation that increase it's population by 11 million per annum.  What has precipitated this decline and what are the ramifications not only for China but also the world? The linked article puts forward some hypothesis.  The article contends that obviously demand for food and wheat in particular will only go up in China, this is obvious given it's steady population growth. But the growth in the economy that has seen per capita income increase considerably over the last ten years has also grown demand at a greater rate than population pressure alone. More money means a desire for more food can be more easily accommodated and this trend will continue as China's wealth grows.  So we have rapidly increasing demand with reducing supply. Why has supply not only failed to keep pace with demand but has actually slipped backwards?  The article points at a number of factors. Firstly the sum of land put aside for cultivation has and will continue to decline. Reducing water supplies generally and a need to divert this limited resource to urban areas has had an impact on the amount of crop sustainable land available, desertification and the policy of reclaiming land and planting trees to offset it and pollution generally is also impacting.  Increased industrialization and urbanisation is gobbling up land stocks. An interesting example provided was that for each additional fifty motor vehicle hitting the roads of China one  hectares needs to be set aside for roads and parking space, incredible. In a recent post I mentioned the sales of luxury vehicles numbered some 95,000 in 2003 that is 1,900 hectares alone just for luxury cars,assuming of course they are incremental to the national fleet.  Add to this infrastructure requirements such as a national transportation system to move people and manufacturing goods for export. All land hungry.  We also see a drift of workers from the poorer rural areas to the cities restricting labour availability. One factor I would like to put forward is the effects of the one child policy on rural economies. Traditionally in rural areas world wide large families were had as a means of supplying cheap and available labour to marginal farmlands. People had several children and employed them in working the land and they did so at little cost. The one child policy has put paid to that. Marginally productive land is no longer viable if it requires hired labour.  The one Child policy is 25 year old this year. The first generation of farm labour not to be born must now be having it's effect.  All this does not mean starvation for the Chinese in the foreseeable future, they have through their headlong rush to industrialization given themselves the means to pay for any shortfalls in national food production for some time. What ultimately it will mean for the rest of the world is rising food prices as Chinese demand pushes prices up.   Linked Article Read Rating : Worthwhile

						     urlLink China Daily :       "The Ministry of Land and Resources on Friday launched a national campaign to shut down coal mines that cause pollution or those without licences."    In light of the upwards of 10,000 miners that die annually in China's private coal mines and the enormous degradation to the environment coal production and consumption causes such a move is welcomed.  China however has a history of promising these coal mining reforms especially after a spate of Coal mining accidents but rarely follows through. Coal providing about 75% of China's energy requirements and working at capacity is just too important to the government for them to take the measures needed.

						    urlLink VOANews.com :     "Since China started opening its economy to the rest of the world a quarter century ago, about 400 million people have been lifted out of poverty. "    Interesting figures and if true a remarkable and commendable result. These figures do give rise however to an interesting debate as to what constitutes  poverty ?  China says about 60 million citizens still live in abject poverty and they claim the "poverty Line" is  less than $79 a year. Apparently this figure is also called the " benefit line " by the Chinese, the figure below which people can apply for government benefits.The World Bank on the other hand estimates that China's truly poor number around 200 million as they use the international standard of living on $1 a day to measure poverty.  China counter claims that the poverty line figure of $1 per day does not take into consideration subsidised housing.  I suppose that only those actually living in poverty in China can tell us a true figure. Obviously there is some merit in what the Chinese say. Housing costs are a very significant determinate of discretionary income, ( I am defining discretionary income here as total income less tax less basic housing) however the difference between $365 per annum and $79 per annum could not surely be put down to housing costs.  The bottom line, as Bruce Murray, who heads the  Asian Development Bank's  mission in Beijing is quoted as saying in the article is that   China needs a broader welfare system to provide a safety net for marginalized groups.     This is particularly true as it concerns the elderly. The one child policy introduced in China 25 years ago will increasingly impact negatively on the welfare of the aged as traditionally children provided significantly to the financial support for aged parents, less children means less support.  Despite being very much still in a developmental stage China should be in a position to widen social security safety nets to some degree, especially for the aged and disabled two of the most vulnerable groups in China.

						     urlLink The Washington Times: World        "Private human rights organizations and Western diplomats say the draft resolution that Washington has started to circulate in diplomatic circles is 'mild' and stops short of condemning human rights violations by China. "    The resolution referred to is one supposedly to censure China over it's record on Human Rights and is being circulated at the United Nations Human Rights Commission currently in it's annual sessions in Geneva.  This report is interesting because it seems to be further evidence that the United States Administration is very luke warm on such a significant condemnation of China and perhaps is only going ahead because it has been backed into a corner. The reported "mildness"of the resolution's wording is almost as if they are saying "ok if we have got to do this let's make it as painless as possible"  Even though Washington signaled very early on that it was likely to propose such a resolution it seemed more "threat" than anything else. Unlike prior years there was very little conviction shown in what was being said out of Washington. When asked by reporters on several occasions whether the U.S. would go ahead with proposing the resolution  State Department spokespersons  used language like "almost certain to" rather than language evidencing greater conviction.   Secretary of State Powell  too was also ominously quiet on the situation throughout the lead up. It was not until the United States House of Representatives passed their own resolution almost unanimously, recommending that the Bush Administration go ahead with the tabling that that there was any real certainty that it would happen at all. The House's action had essentially backed the Administration into a corner.   We also had a reported telephone conversation between Powell and the Chinese Foreign Minister on the eve of the sessions which, as I commented at the time, seemed as if either some deal was going down or it was a "heads up" and apology in advance.  In fact when the U.S intentions as to the resolution tabling were publicly confirmed the Chinese Foreign ministry stated that the Americans had " gone back on their word " as if confirming that some deal had been brokered and was now being reneged upon.  And finally there was the apparent delay in getting the ball rolling in Geneva. When questioned as to this at a recent  State Department "Noon Briefing"  the State spokesperson was very defensive and when asked how much support the resolution was likely to receive he stated that they did not know. How do they not know unless they do not really care? This is diplomacy after all and it is all about backroom lobbying and for the U.S. not to know how much support such an important resolution was likely to enjoy is, to say the least, incredible.  I am betting that the Administration was originally not going to go ahead with this resolution and had assured the Chinese as much. Whether they brokered some trade off with the Chinese it is impossible to know but very likely. Then, when the House of Representatives voted so overwhelmingly to recommend that the resolution be tabled, the Bush Administration was stymied.  Quick apologetic phone calls to the Chinese, vacillation on the timing of the resolutions introduction, calls of "foul play" from the Chinese and finally a "mildly" worded resolution.  Am I reading too much into this?   Linked Article Read Rating : Worthwhile

						         I have to post this photo which is appearing over at the Uyghur Information Agency (an Uygur Diaspora news and current affairs site-see link in menu).  It is in protest at a recent report that the Chinese government are stopping Uygur language tuition in 50 rural schools in Xinjiang. It also refers to the general pressures on and discrimination against  the Uygurs over the use of their language.  The caption says "From today you all speak, write and read in Chinese. Only Separatists speak Uygur" The mouth gags have Uygur script on them.   Do you notice that only one girl is wearing the traditional head covering of Islam? Despite Chinese claims of Uygur  Islamic extremism  and Islamic  terrorism  the Uygur ,whilst being devout Muslims, practice a much more liberal view of Islam unlike the Muslims of Arab extraction. Also, unlike the Arabs, the Uygurs have a great liking for the West and America in particular, traditionally looking in that direction for assistance and support rather than to the middle east.  A little trivia. Do you now the Uygur script was adopted by  Ghengiz Khan  as the first written script of the Mongol Empire. In those days the Uygur were respected widely as a people of learning and high culture. The Mongols, who nominally ruled the Uygurs for a period, used the Uygurs expertise extensively in law making, governance and diplomacy.

This is a point that is constantly brought up whenever the Lama visits foreign countries  The reason is that these governments do not officially recognise the  Tibetan Government in Exile  as being "legitimate" and as such any official reception would be against diplomatic protocol and bring very loud howls of protest from the People's Republic.  I do not think that this phases the Lama as much as it appears to phase the Tibetan's supporters.

						    urlLink  www.phayul.com     Well there has been  criticism of China coming through at the Geneva UN Human Rights Commission hearings underway at the moment but the tone of countries appear tempered as a function of what potential trade deals are around.  The  United States  as widely reported recently tabled  Resolution 503  calling for condemnation of China's recent Human rights record and now  Phayul,   the Tibetan news site brings us some excerpts of statements made by various countries at this year's Commission hearings.  The  European Union  called  for continued dialogue on Human Rights between China and itself whilst voicing their concern as to the repression of the cultural and religious rights of the Uygurs and Tibetans.  The  Australians  only just fell short of outright praise with only a veiled side swipe at China using the " War On Terror " as an excuse for persecution of ethnic minorities. Whilst they identified the plight of the Uygur and Tibetans it was pretty weak stuff. Some big trade deals have gone down lately and  there must be some more coming up! Australia is having a dream run with it's trade deals of late.   New Zealand  too was less than firm failing, in the excerpts at least, to mention the Tibetans and Uygurs by name. Now I know for a fact that they want the " honour " to be the first western country to enter into a  Free Trade agreement  with China.   Canada  ,which is home to many Uygurs and Tibetans, spoke of Uygur and Tibetan rights whilst  Norway  only mentioned the Tibetans.    It is a delicate balance this diplomacy thing, of that I am sure. Diplomats must frame their words in such a fashion to get a point across without causing outright offence or backing a country into a corner that it has no way out of.  As well, China has made gains in Human Rights, of that there is no doubt, so some acknowledgement and encouragement must be given in that quarter.   Let us hope that this is the motivation for the rather tepid criticism and not the fear of losing that lucrative trade deal or investment opportunity.

						      China with it’s population of 1.3 billion is "home" to 56 ethnic groups. One of these is the little known Uygur people of Xinjiang which, with numbers at 8 million, is a sizeable group and by far the most different culturally to the majority Han Chinese.  The Uygurs (pronounced Wee-Gurrs) are a Caucasian Turkic speaking people who have for over 1,200 years lived in what is now known as Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in north west China,   Xinjiang is a huge area. At 637,000 sq mi (1,650,257 sq km), It is some five times larger than Italy and comprises one third of the total land mass of China. Geographically it is best described as two large basins nestling on either side of a great dividing mountain range, the Tian Shan.   To the north west of the Tian Shan is the Dzungaria basin and, at it’s eastern end on the Kazakhstan border, is the Dzungarian Gate, a pass which for centuries was used as an invasion route by conquerors from central Asia. It is in this basin that the Xinjiang capital city Urumqi (Urumchi) is situated   The crater like Tarim Basin lies in the south east and is home to the Taklamakan Desert, the world’s tenth largest desert, famous for its swiftly moving sand dunes.   Scattered around the Tarim and on the edges of the Taklamakan are oases towns that once sat proudly astride the great Silk trade routes that crossed through Xinjiang linking China and the east to Europe.  Xinjiang was a barren, desolate and inhospitable land when the Uygurs migrated there en masse some 1,200 years ago but, even then, they were no strangers to this land. It had been, for the previous one hundred odd years, one of but many far flung dominions ruled by a mighty Uygur Empire.  The Uygur, as they are known today, grew from a number of tribes and clans that lived a nomadic lifestyle in Mongolia and southern Siberia for untold centuries before the time of Christ. Through alliances several tribes grew together in size and strength to a point where in 745 CE they were able to form the "Uygur Orkhan Empire" centred in Mongolia. For the next hundred years under the leadership of various Khagans (Rulers) they stretched their empire by subjugation and expansion throughout Mongolia and most of Central Asia, east to present day Gansu province in China and south to Tibet and India.  Controlling the very hub of the "Silk Road" trade routes they became rich and, with a mighty army, widely feared. So great was their military power that the rulers of China’s Tang Dynasty pleaded with the Uygur to assist them at a time when an internal rebellion threatened to rent the sovereignty. This they did and were rewarded by the Tang with an annual "Tribute" of Silk in perpetuity and the hands of many Chinese princesses.  So great was their empire that at one stage they even contemplated conquering China, a move that would have changed history, but internal strife put paid to that idea.  In 840 CE the Uygur were defeated by another Turkic tribe and rather than live in subjugation migrated en masse to present day China. Though defeated their move to the Tarim was the start of a golden period of culture. Taking up a sedentary lifestyle and eking a living from the harsh land and the traders of the Silk Road they became highly respected for their culture and as a centre for Buddhist religion and learning.   With the advent of the Mongol Empire the Uygur nominally became vassals but so great was the respect in which they were held by the Mongols that they were left virtually to govern themselves. In fact the Uygur became the mentor of various Mongol Khans serving and instructing them at high levels in areas of governance, law making and diplomacy. It was to the Uygur that Ghengis Khan looked to when developing a written language for his empire and it was the Uygur script that was adopted and used.  The Uygur had converted to Islam by the 15th century and remained virtually independent until being invaded by the Qing (Manchu ) Dynasty in 1876. From that date on, apart from a few years of independence in the 1940’s, they have remained under Chinese rule and their homeland has become "Xinjiang", meaning "New Territories or Dominions" in Chinese   The Communists   The Communist Party of China marched into Xinjiang unopposed in 1949 displacing a crumbling Nationalist government. The leaders of the Uygurs were promised that Xinjiang would become an "autonomous" region under the umbrella of the Chinese State. The Uygur were at that time the majority ethnic group and numbered 3 million to the Han’s 300,000.  In hindsight the promises of Mao Zedong and the CCP to the Uygurs were nothing more than sops to keep them under control until the "Centre" and Communist rule could be consolidated. Perhaps a portent of things to come was the mysterious crash of a plane in 1949 carrying most of the Uygur’s leaders to Beijing for negotiations with the Communist Party. Whilst there is nothing to say that it was any more than a highly coincidental "accident" the decapitation of Uygur leadership was to be an ill omen.  It took they Communists until 1954 before they could turn their full attention to the Uygur and Xinjiang. In 1955 the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region was officially proclaimed and from then it was a slow downward spiral for the Uygur.  1957-60 and the Collectivisation and the "Great Leap Forward" policies of Mao Zedong were hard for the Uygur. Historically Uygurs were self employed artisans, traders or small land owners and farmers and as such felt the changes that communism brought with it hard to accept. As well, being Muslim, many of the new communist rules and policies clashed with their religious beliefs and practices.  By 1964, with the Chinese first atomic tests carried out in Xinjiang and with the first wave of Han immigrants having arrived, the Uygur began to realise that the promise of autonomy was perhaps nothing but an empty illusion.  Han Chinese migration to Xinjiang had commenced in the 1950’s. An early trickle became a stream and finally in the late 1960’ and 70’s a torrent. By this stage the Uygur who had outnumbered the Han in 1949 began to see their position in their own land gravely threatened.  Notwithstanding, life even with it’s new communist stamp, continued reasonably quietly for the majority of the Uygurs until the mid sixties. The "Cultural Revolution" that commenced in 1966 saw Red Guards destroy many mosques in Xinjiang and the Uygurs experienced the first real clampdown on their religious and basic freedoms.   After the Cultural Revolution the situation lightened slightly. Mosques were re-built and religious persecution eased, however Han migration picked up pace as the economy and infrastructure of Xinjiang grew and the wealth in the ground became more fully appreciated.  The late 1980’s saw the beginning of the demise of the old Soviet Union and the beginning in earnest of the period of Uygur persecution and human rights violations that in one form or another continues to today. These two occurrences were not simply coincidental.  The Chinese watched closely as the old Soviet Union imploded to analyse the reasons why the birthplace of State Communism was falling apart. It would seem that their analysis identified two factors for the Soviet’s demise namely race and religion. The Chinese came to the belief that these two factors were the enemy of socialist regimes and therefore began the implementation of strategies to combat these twin "evils" and so ensure the long term survival of communism in China.  Two other factors came into play as co-determinants of the Uygur’s future.   Firstly, the demise of the Soviet’s saw the setting up of several central Asian republics all of which were Islamic and most of which were Turkic peoples. Their physical proximity, "blood lines" and similarities in culture and religion made it seem quite feasible to a watchful Beijing that there could be an attempt to set up some form of Pan-Turkic or Pan-Islamic alliance that could involve Xinjiang.  Coincident too was the pro democracy feeling that swept the world and the upcoming handover of Hong Kong to the PRC, at that time an unknown quantity. These factors, combined with the rumblings in Tibet, posed a significant potential threat to the Central Government. They feared a domino effect if the likes of the Uygurs or Tibetans were to attempt to "separate" from China, one that could involve Hong Kong and then perhaps any number of the other ethnic groups within China.   To a degree their analysis was correct. The fall of the Soviet Union and the setting up of the Central Asian Republics breathed hope into some Uygur that they perhaps could achieve their dream of an independent free state of East Turkestan. Many small groups sprung up talking independence of one form or another. These groups though small, ill organised and unfunded were nevertheless considered to pose a real threat in the eyes of the Chinese.  Tensions between the Han and Uygur continued to rise against this backdrop as a result of the continued "flood" of Han into Xinjiang and the privations the Uygurs were forced to exist under. A series of disturbances commencing with a riot in Hotan (Khotan) began in 1990. Though small and isolated they were harshly put down by the Chinese government.  The Chinese began, during the nineties, to increasingly identify any type of dissent by the Uygur as being "splittist" or "terrorist" inspired. It is without doubt some Uygur groups did cause problems during the course of the 1990’s,including acts of violence, but it was never what could be correctly termed terrorist activity. If violence was inflicted it was against the government or very specific targets such as pro-Chinese Uygur clerics, the general public was not, by and large, directly involved.  The decade of the 1990’s therefore became a watershed one for the Uygur. It witnessed even larger inflows of Chinese Han into the region and by the end of the decade the ratio of Uygur to Han had gone from 10:1 in 1949 to almost parity.  It was also a period when the Uygur finally realised that the "autonomy" and "self determination" promised them would never be delivered. The crackdowns on rights of association particularly religious gatherings increased, travel was restricted and "re-education" programmes saw the independence of the Islamic clerics destroyed. The perceived "rape of the ancestral land, the growing wealth disparities between Han and Uygur, the destruction of Uygur heritage through wholesale demolitions of Uygur areas, all these things fostered a feeling of intense marginalisation among the Uygur.   If the 1990’s were to be a watershed decade then 1997 was to be the watershed year. The hand over of Hong Kong, scheduled for mid 1997, was a period of some trepidation and one seen by some Uygur as being perhaps a "now or never" time. They collectively knew that if the Hong Kong handover went smoothly then their fate was sealed.  In February of that year a small demonstration numbering around one thousand mainly Uygur youths protesting religious persecution ended in a blood bath. Depending on whose version of events you take either 9 people died or hundreds did. It was however what ensued was also of  major importance. The response to the incident in the small town of Gulja (Yining) was quick, expansive and extremely brutal by any standards.  Immediately following the incident Martial Law was imposed in all the major towns and cities of Xinjiang and thousands of troops were sent to the region by Beijing. The Chinese appeared to work themselves into a frenzy concerning what they called the "three dangers" "splitism, religious extremism and terrorism". Despite a relatively small number Uygurs being involved in the incident in Gulja within weeks it is reported that several thousand Uygurs had been interrogated or imprisoned throughout Xinjiang. There were also uncollaborated reports of torture and summary executions.   In response to this frenzied situation several revenge bombings took place in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, and Beijing. These bombings and other "terrorist" activities that China has claimed have occurred since that time have never fully been proven though some, no doubt, did occur. The Gulja Incident, despite it’s  spontaneous eruption, was also categorised as a premeditated act of terrorism.   Any remaining freedoms of association, speech or of religion were curtailed after Gulja and have, to this date, never fully been restored. Any form of dissent was considered the acts of "terrorists" and "terrorism" and treated accordingly.  It is estimated that as a result of the Gulja incident some 220 Uygurs have been executed. Many others have died in prison of "illnesses" such as "pneumonia". The last person executed over this 1997 event occurred as late as October 2003. Why he was kept alive so long after most of the others were despatched within days and weeks is anyone’s guess.   With Gulja the world changed from bad to worse for the Uygur and the events of "September 11" provided the Chinese an opportunity to legitimise their gross violations of the Uygur’s Human rights by labelling the Uygur as religious extremists and terrorists. By identifying the Uygurs so the Chinese were able to mask their abuses from an outside world.  Since "9/11" the Chinese have made many claims including that large numbers of Uygurs fought with the Taliban and that Uygur "terrorist organisations" were strong and active and receiving funding from Al Qaeda. Whether through ignorance or design the west has swallowed it all to the point of supporting China in obtaining a U.N. listing of a little known Uygur independence organisation as an international terrorist group. This despite the majority of world commentators seriously doubting the veracity of most of the  allegations.  In all this the Chinese Government has kept up incredible pressure on all aspects of Uygur life with an ultimate view of rooting out any desire or will to "separate" and to destroy the "three evils". It is a thinly veiled policy aimed at breaking the collective spirit of the Uygur people by destroying their culture and in doing so neutralise them as a potential problem.   Future Of the Uygur   The dye, for all intents and purposes, has been caste for the Uygur. If they had ever had a possibility of achieving a free East Turkestan that was lost in 1949 and the majority of Uygurs are now resigned to that fact. For this once great people, former rulers of most of Central Asia and one third of today’s China, mentors of the Mongol Empire and champions of Buddhism, their only hope now is that, with support from the "free world", they will have the opportunity to determine their future within China and to live a life free from persecution.  Whether this support will be forthcoming in light of the Uygurs religious affiliations and the lure of the burgeoning Chinse economy is another question.

						    urlLink People's Daily    I am drawn to post this link because I think despite my last three posts today being criticisms of Human Rights violations being perpetrated by the Government of China it is important to remember that there have been some very fine improvements over the last two years.  The People's Daily attempts to highlight some of these in it's article questioning why the U.S. has sponsored a resolution against China in the U.N HR Commission currently underway.  Most taken in isolation are  no great shakes in terms of importance but they perhaps are portents of a promising future. One of the examples given is as follows:    The decades-old compulsory practice of rounding up and extraditing people found roaming in cities gave way to a sympathetic relief programme, and police were prohibited from conducting unwarranted identification checks.    I can vouch for this being true as I carried a news item recently of Chinese complaining  vehemently about the rise in the incidence of beggars on the streets of China. Everyone blamed the repeal of a law, that used to allow for "measures" to keep these people off the streets, for this sudden plague.  We must applaud the good as well as criticise the bad in China's journey forward so this post is for all the good changes...... now what about this blog censorship thing?.....

The original letter was much revised by others on the net and this latter version was the one tended to the courts.  The sentence is considered quite light by Chinese standards especially as Ouyang Yi has a history of arrests on similar charges.  What can you say?

						     urlLink People's Daily :       "...if the means of development as high input and heavy pollution with low efficiency continues, environmental loss will be four to five times as much as that at present. "    So says  Qu Geping, Chairman of China Environmental Protection Foundation,  at a lecture given in Beijing recently.  Joined in the lecture by  Maurice F. Strong, special advisor to US Secretary-General and Chairman of Earth Council    lectured on the concept of " sustainable development " in China.  With China's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) having reached 11 trillion yuan (US$1.33 trillion) in 2003 and with this figure expected to quadruple in 2020 to USD 4 trillion the Chinese Government has some major problems balancing the need for economic development with the needs of the environment.  The People's Daily reported Mr. Strong as stating that the hardest environmental problems ahead for China are the  land deterioration  and  water pollution . The downfall of the productivity of China's soil will incur serious results for China which is now nourishing 22 percent of the world's population with only 7 percent of the world's land.  This fact is not lost on China's leaders having in 2003 enacted the " Environment Impact Assessment Law " stipulating that new projects can not be commenced until being evaluated as to their possible impact on environment.  Having Laws is one thing enforcing them is another al together different thing. China's record on enforcing laws of this kind has been very poor, one only has to look at the number of coal mines operating quite openly that have been "officially closed down"   Linked Article Read Rating : Worthwhile

						     urlLink China Daily :       "China's largest onshore oil field, Daqing Oil Field, faces ``imminent exhaustion'' of its exploitable reserves, local authorities said Wednesday."    The  Daqing Oil Field  once boasted apparently 2.2 billion tons of exploitable oil reserve and this is now down to an estimated 500 million tons.   Energy is a huge problem for China. The demand for it is great obviously because of the size of the population and the climate but also because of the surging economy and commercial requirements.  Coal currently meets 75% of China's energy requirements and she has the third largest coal deposits and is the largest consumer of coal in the world. Currently some 200,000 coal mines operate to exploit this valuable resource.  China faces several major problems relating to energy. Firstly coal and coal mining has an incredibly detrimental effect on the environment. Pollution is a very major concern to the Chinese Government. Secondly China is extremely inefficient in it's energy usage and the state heavily subsidises energy costs for the "private" sector. To achieve a 1% increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) requires more than a 2% increase in energy consumption.  This problem is not lost on the Chinese Government and they are desperately seeking ways to fuel projected growth through importing of gas and oil, exploring nuclear power options and pursuing hydro_electrical schemes such as the  urlLink Three Gorges Project

						    urlLink Yahoo! :      "Shen said Washington went back on its word to 'suddenly' announce the resolution amid consultations between the two. "    So has been quoted  Assistant Foreign Minister Shen Guofang  on the decision by the U.S. to introduce a resolution condemning China's Human Rights record at this years U.N. Human Rights Commission sessions in Geneva.  I have said in several posts leading up to the Geneva Conference that the vibes I was getting was that the U.S. would not seek such a resolution this year as it had not done last year.  So confident was I that I laid a bet here at this blog that it would not happen. My feelings were based on several things. Firstly the release of some high profile political prisoners, some very open "Mea Culpa" statements coming out of Beijing, the amendment to the constitution  and several other events. Secondly, the failure of the U.S State Department to categorically say in the lead up to Geneva that a Resolution would be introduced. It was statements such as " almost certain " when pressed for what their direction will be that said to me some behind the scenes negotiations were happening. Then we had the phone conversations between  urlLink U.S.Secretary of State Colin Powell  and the  urlLink Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing  in the lead up to Geneva.  My confidence swayed slightly when the U.S. House of Representatives voted almost unanimously to call upon the President to table such a resolution.  Now we have Assistant Foreign Minister Chen saying that the U.S. "went back on it's word to suddenly.." Introduce the resolution much as if some deal had been brokered that the U.S. suddenly reneged upon.   The   urlLink  State Department's Noon Briefing   the day before last had the Spokesperson wiggling uncomfortably when pressed as to why the Commission was under way one week before State announced it's intentions. He also was a little uncomfortable when asked as to what support the U.S. expected for it's resolution.  Did the President and the State Department broker some deal? Did the House of Reps motion throw a"spanner in the works"? And now are The Chinese, perhaps justifiably, a bit peeved off?

						     urlLink State Department Noon Briefing, March 22, 2004     I have touched on this before today, the fact that the U.S. will sponsor a resolution at the currently running U.N. Human Rights Commission sessions in Geneva.  I point to this particular State Department briefing for a couple of reasons.  Firstly, one of the reporters questioned why it took so long to table the resolution. It is a question that have I asked myself over the last week and abit. I got the impression that maybe it would not happen and then if it were possibly to happen the delay may evidence some on going discussion or negotiation with China.  The spokesman's response does not throw much light on any reasons for delay (if in fact you can call it delay) What did come through however was that perhaps there is not a lot of support for the resolution from other member countries.  In response to a straightforward question as to what support the U.S. has, he answered.    MR. BOUCHER: (State Department Spokesperson) I think -- I don't think I can make that kind of judgment at this point, that there's -- obviously, there are other people who are concerned about the situation in China. It's sometimes difficult to turn that concern into actual votes in the Commission, frankly.    Not a particularly encouraging reply. All in all very unpromising.  These resolutions that the U.S. has sponsored against China each year it has been able to, bar last year, never do get passed due to the Chinese Bloc but the U.S. have always done it with a little gusto regardless. Not this time.   Maybe a case of "Gotta do it but wish I didn't" ?    Linked Article Read Rating:  Worthwhile

						     urlLink People's Daily :       "China should balance economic growth with environmental protection to avoid repeating the 'first pollute, then control' mode, said Xu Kuangdi, president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), on Monday. "    China's phenomenal growth is not without it's drawbacks. One is the effect that industrialisation is having on the environment; land degradation, air and water pollution, all these are already monumental problems and given that China wishes to quadruple it's economy by 2020 not likely to get any better without some significant policies and actions implemented now.   China relies for 75% of it's fuel requirements on coal burning and one only has to have a look at Europe and particularly England in the 19th century to understand the effects of a coal fueled economy. As well the country is grossly inefficient in it's energy usage thus compounding the potential problems.  Whilst the Government is implementing cleaner energy sources such as hydro and atomic energy the fact is that for the foreseeable future coal will remain a mainstay energy supply.  The linked article cites the president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering drawing attention to the potential problems and offering generalised solutions.  He focuses rightly so on the efficient use of energy as being one thing that must be addressed to avoid what well could be an environmental tragedy. But it can not be the only solution, energy management can only go so far. China must reduce it's reliance on fossil fuels particularly coal which is far and away a "dirtier" source even than oil derived fuels. How it can do this I have not a clue.   I do not think however that it can be done to a degree to counter the negative environmental effects of the proposed economic growth. If this is the case than China is going to face one huge problem come 2020.   Linked Article Read Rating:  Worthwhile

						        The  87 coal miners working the face of the  Mengnanzhuang coalmine , a “Village” owned operation in  Shanxi Province China , on March 22, 2003 noticed the smell of gas building up in the mine shaft they were working. Fearing an explosion they began to evacuate but were confronted by the mine manager and forced by whatever means or threats back to their positions at the coal face.  One hour later a massive explosion ripped through the mine killing all but 15 of those working down there that day. The “rescue” operation was so pitiful that three days later on March 22, at least 30 bodies were still to be seen under plastic sheets decomposing in the direct sunlight on the grounds outside the mine entrance. The 15 that survived are believed to have “ran away” after defying the Managers directions to return to the coal face and in doing so saving their lives. The coal mine at the time of the accident had been "officially closed down" since January.   This description of the events leading to the  deaths of 72 men  is, unfortunatly, not an execeptional set of circumstances. The Mengnanzhuang mine is like so many of the reputed 200,000 coal mines of China’s Coal mining industry whose operations officially kill on average  18 Chinese miners per day .( some analysts place this figure as high as 28)  China is the largest producer and consumer of coal in the world and sits on top of the globes third largest coal deposits. It’s 200,000 odd coalmines pump out in excess of 1.4  billion tonnes of coal a year which is one-third of the world’s output and despite this volume can not keep up with local demand.   It also has the unenviable reputation of pumping out, according to some sources, some 10,000 coffins per annum.  Coal mining in China is a very, very important industry. Coal is the primary fuel source in China and is used to generate approximately 75% of all China’s energy requirements and underpins China’s massive and meteoric economic rise over the last twenty years.   Without coal China’s industries would literally grind to a halt, countless thousands would die from the cold and China’s economic “miracle” would evaporate overnight.    It is so important that the Chinese Government has, over the last ten years at least, been willing to trade the lives of 10,000 miners per year to keep the industry producing. Each year the government demands enormous percentage increases in production just to try to keep pace with demand. Increases of a magnitude that would be considered unsustainable in most industries let alone one with such huge occupational health and safety issues.  The statistics of the industry are mind boggling. In 2002 output was 1.4 billion tonnes. In the period January 1 2004 to March 7 production was estimated at 262.29 million tonnes putting it on target for a full year output of around 1.8 million tonnes. These 2004 figures are up some 21.7% on the corresponding period in 2003.  China at one time had 430,000 coalmines and it is estimated today that there are some 200,000 in operation. Essentially there are three types of coal mining operations running in China, The State Owned Enterprises (SOE’s) which typically are the giants in terms of per mine output, the Village owned mines which are run by and for local villages and the privately owned or “Local” mines.  With economic growth at 9.1% in 2003 and planned economic growth of  8% p.a. in the next five years the demands on the industry will be enormous. As a rule of thumb coal output has had to increase in excess of 2 percentage points for every one percent of economic growth. So if the economy is growing at say 8% per annum coal output must increase by 16% to keep pace. China obviously is desperately searching for alternative fuel sources but for the foreseeable future coal will remain the mainstay.    What does this mean in terms of fatalities in the industry? It means ever growing numbers. China’s fatality rate is 3.824 deaths per one million tons as compares to fatality rates of .1 for both Australia and the US the 4th and 2nd ranked producers respectively.  Sustaining growth above double figures in any business for any length of time is extremely difficult. Mature businesses can handle it better than immature businesses. To ask businesses in a high risk industry coming off the base that a majority of China’s coal minors are coming off to achieve sustained annual growth in excess of 16% for the industry as a whole, is inviting catastrophe,   This situation is further exacerbated when we realise that the overall growth rate is being supported more by the private and village mines then the state owned enterprises, Some of these former category mines are experiencing annual output growth of as high as 30%. 50% of China’s output is provided by such mines and they are the mines most at risk  So we have a situation where    output requirements are growing at an generally unsustainable rate in terms of management capabilities, mine infrastructure and OH&S considerations.    These growth requirements are being met more by the smaller and less controlled mines, the very same mines that contribute the highest to the death toll.   More output requires more workers and these are literally being thrown down the shaft with little or no training or experience.  The end result given the current state of affairs is obvious: exponential growth in deaths and injuries.  So what is the government doing?  For the last ten years and on a regular basis, generally co-incident with some tragedy, the government announces rafts of reforms and penalties supposedly designed to clean up the industry.  Despite the fact that probably 200,000 mines have been permanently closed down in that period the governments announcements have been little more than rhetoric.  In August last year  Premier Wen Jaibao  personally ordered a complete overhaul of the industry as it concerns OH& S . His pronouncement immediately resulted in all but the major four coalmines being either closed down or ordered to reduce or pause production until such time as they were able to upgrade safety.  So great was the consequent loss of production (estimated to be 36.64 million in the third quarter 2003) and so major was the flow on effects to high energy use industries such as steel production, that in September a directive was given that “checks had to be sped up and coal mines re-opened”. In November the State Development and Planning Commission ordered all of the SOE’s to increase production as much as possible and that coal mines under “rectification” were ordered to resume production as soon practicable.  Once fully back in production the industry has in the first  two and a half months of 2004 increased production 21.7% above the corresponding period in 2003. The local and village mines, those most at risk from an OH& S viewpoint increased production 30.3% and 25.2% respectively.   Apart from periodically announcing reforms and industry shakeouts and the Wen directive the government does precious little.    There are 200,000 odd mines and only a few odd thousand mine inspectors nationwide. (Juxtapose this to the reputed 30,000 state employees assigned to Internet censorship and monitoring)   Most of the mines are local or village owned mines where graft and corruption is rife and laws are circumvented in a myriad number of ways. Workers for example are paid “off the books” to avoid certain legislation. The bottom line is that once you move away from the SOE’s the industry is a cesspool of greed and corruption  It is obvious, given the turnaround in policy, that the Government has decided that economic growth must come first at all costs and part of that cost is the price in terms of human lives and suffering.  The situation can not improve on the basis of the current legislation and the demands on the industry. Obviously wholesale shutdowns and other safety “rectification “ methods can not be the answer as the nation is just too dependent on coal as can be seen in the results of the Wen exercise,  The only real fix is the establishment of alternative fuel sources combined with a drive for more efficient use of energy, but that is along term solution. In the meantime the Government must find ways and means to dramatically reduce this slaughter of innocent workers in the name of the “national good”  Firstly, from the Chinese governments point of view, more money and resources are needed to be thrown at the problem. The 2004 mine safety budget of 2,2 billion Yuan (US$265m) despite being 200,000,000 up on the average of the previous two years is apparently inadequate. Having only a handful of inspectors clearly is. A massive anti -corruption drive is required to eradicate corruption at all levels within the industry and the setting up of workers Unions or advocacy bodies to watchdog and protect workers rights is a necessity.  Secondly, the international community needs to get involved as clearly the problem is too big for China to solve on her own. What this is likely to entail I am not expert enough to provide a solution but for thought starters a combination of any of the following plus any other practical solutions that no doubt escape me would be a start  1. A “Lend Lease” type arrangement to supply fuel to take the pressure off local producers so as reforms can be implemented, 2. Provision of high level expertise to investigate the industry and propose reforms. 3. Provision of experts on the ground to aid in implementing reform 4. Provision of expertise in energy management to investigate and propose reforms to energy management by industry and the nation generally. 5. Economic sanctions or penalties benched marked to safety results.  Essentially whatever and for how long it takes to reduce significantly this tragic and wasteful loss of lives.   This problem is huge, it will not get better by itself only worsen and it is a gross infringement on Human rights. China and the international community must act decisively and act now to turn this problem around.

"    What China is essentially saying here is  "bud out of our affairs as it concerns Human Rights in our country"   China has long maintained, and not without some justification, that the situation regarding human rights in China is unique and other nations and people  should not attempt to impose their value systems on China. They argue the welfare of the whole must take precedence over the welfare of the individual.  Obviously, pre-empting criticism expected to come at this Geneva based U.N. Human Rights Commission annual meeting, the Chinese spokesperson has set the stage as to what China's "defense" will be.  But, whilst I have some sympathy for what China is saying, I do not believe their "unique position" justifies their excesses.  Yes, they are a populous country but so is India and the latter's record whilst not perfect is better than China's.  Yes, they have a diverse religious and ethnic base to contend with, but not more or less than a lot of countries.  No, I am sorry. This argument whilst going some way towards mitigation does not exonerate.  The problems in  Tibet  and the " Uygur Question " do not stem from population pressures, "terrorism" nor any other overriding human rights considerations. The problems are purely a result of race, religion and defense of what China see as it's national "integrity"   It is time they stop making excuses and start making some headway on Human Rights.

"    Well the Brits are first in with some comment at the United Nations Human Rights Convention in Geneva  in session at the moment.

The State Department did not propose a Resolution last year stating that China had made good progress in it's Human Rights trend. This year however "State" has accused China of "Backsliding"  Mr. Bill Rammell, MP and Foreign & Commonwealth Office Parliamentary Under-Secretary Of State, gave an address at the High Level segment of the Commission's 60th meeting.  Mr Rammell went on to say:    "But, there are times when the level of violations so high, when the consequences for the victims, the region and the world are so great, and when the political will to tackle the problems, alone or in cooperation, is so manifestly absent, that we have to take more immediate action. In these situations, we must sometimes rely on pressure - peer pressure - as the only means left by which to promote and protect those human rights which underpin the freedom, justice and peace to which we all aspire."

A quick search on Google showed many others over the years. Each has resulted in  numerous  deaths  and injuries.  In a BBC article entitled  urlLink  China Admits Grim Safety Record  a Chinese Official stated that in 2000 there were  5300 mining deaths  and the then the Year to Date October 2001 figures were 4500.

One of the earlier articles suggested that the real casualty figures are greater than  10,000 deaths per annum.   The Governments of the free world and companies doing business in Xinjiang should also be asking questions and threatening sanctions. This is an horrendous loss of life.  China must be called on to convene an investigative commission immediately to analyse work place safety in the industry and to implement rapid and across the board changes to rectify this incredible state of affairs.

						        Two Australian Newspapers are carrying this story that  Cao Siyuan  has fled China. Details are sketchy but it is known that Cao was in the U.S. to attend a seminar entitled " Amending China's Constitution: From Dictatorship to Peaceful Democratization " which took place on February 24, 2004, at The Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE) in Washington, DC.  Cao Siyuan is one of the more radical advocates of political reform in China  and he  runs a consultancy in Beijing offering advice on bankruptcy and mergers.    Cao enjoys a considerable stature in China, since he helped to draft the country's bankruptcy law in the 1980s when he got the nickname " Bankruptcy King "    Cao Siyuan was a senior adviser to Party Secretary General    urlLink Zhao Ziyang    and was arrested in 1989 for his role in proposing a legal challenge to the declaration of Martial Law in Beijing after  Tiananmen Square  massacre. He was released in 1990. Interestingly current premier Wen Jia Bao worked at the time for Zhao Ziang but was able to survive politically despite the fall of his boss over the internal party upheaval as to how to handle the Students of Tiananmen Square.  A copy of one of his papers can be found at  urlLink  The Future of Chinese Political Reform   which I believe was delivered at the University of California LA  According to the Australian news report Cao had been under close scrutiny by security forces in the lead up to the National People's Congress. The report does not say when he left China only that he had a "one way" ticket.  If this report is true it could be a huge slap in the face to the Chinese Communist Party so close to the NPC approving the two constitutional amendments relating to private ownership of property and Human Rights. Both topics having been mainstays of Cao's activism over the last several years.

I have only one criticism however for in the article the author infers that the use of the word "terrorist" to describe Uygur "separatist/nationalists" only came into the Chinese lexicon after "9/11". This is not the case to be fair the Han began using the word as a metaphor for "separatist" ( name given by Chinese to those Uygurs seeking an independent Uygur state) frequently after the Uygur "riots" in Yining (Gulja) in 1997 as a consequence of which it is claimed many hundreds of Uygurs were executed and imprisoned, and  some consequent retaliation attacks.

						    urlLink The Epoch Times :       "On March 10, in Kashgar, Xinjiang Province, an elderly man was killed when he refused to vacate his home while it was being demolished for new land development. "   urlLink The Epoch Times   I find this report disturbing on two fronts. Firstly, and obviously, someone has reportedly died and that is enough in itself but on a second front such an event occurred whilst the National People's Congress was in session with it's obviously premeditated theme of " People First " (this incident is supposed to have happened around the 10th of March)  Alright, you may say we have here a local, over zealous, official whose orders for a bulldozer to go in when someone was still in the house resulted in an accidental death. Obviously the death was not intended but on the other hand injury or death to the person is apossible scenario when you drive a bulldozer into an occupied house. This in my books constitutes manslaughter as any anyone acting with a similar result in most free countries would now be facing criminal charges.  But this event is typical and the Chinese have a very long history in forced home evictions. Thousands have reportedly occurred in Beijing as China  makes way for the  Beijing Olympics . Hundreds have occurred in Xinjiang and primarily those most effected are the Uygur ethnic minority. More times than not graft and corruption is involved in these forced evictions. To quote the article;    "A man surnamed Shan, manager of the Real Estate Management Division of KRPC, said that the local government even showed forged documents to force the company to tear down retired employees recreation center. Shan said that although the company knew the government's actions were illegal, they did not dare to oppose the government for fear of the consequences.    This type of things happen more often against the Uygur because, by virtue of their repressed and fearful position, it is unlikely that they will make formal complaints. Corrupt officials in the pay of the developers can virtually do as they please   Legally, of course,the State is the owner of all property in China, as such they "legally" have the right to evict "tenants". It does not matter, as probably is the case in this instance, that we are talking one hundred  plus year old buildings that were "appropriated" by the communist Government in 1949 from the very same people they are now evicting. The law is the law.  But look at this case in point to understand the methodology and inherent cruelty in the Han's actions. The tennant " received notification a week before the demolition " according to a local policeman. This person as is the case in many instances, could have been living in this house for decades and it may have been in the family for one hundred plus years. To receive one weeks notice is a horrendous.  Then, as is the case here, the dispossessed are offered "compensation" or "relocation expenses". This compensation has nothing to do with the house value it is literally just enough to re-locate. A dispute over the monetary value of the compensation payment appears to have been the catalyst for this tragedy  What is an added concern is that these demolitions are wholesale and do not take into consideration any heritage/cultural  value of the properties. Admittedly to a westerners eyes some of the demolitions have been of properties one could class as "slum" properties however they are part of a cultural lifestyle.    urlLink Kashgar (Kashi)  , the city in Xinjiang where this incident is reported to have occurred has been an Uygur city since well before the 9th century C.E. It was once an important Silk Road town and was visited by Marco Polo in the 13th century. As a center of learning religion and culture it was once pre-eminent in Central Asia. To turn it into a concrete and glass jungle as the Han have done with the Xinjiang capital  urlLink Urumqi  is a travesty and this alone should bring the attention of the world upon what is happening there if the death of an old man does not. No one can stand in the way of progess admiitedly but wholesale destruction is another thing.  Apart from the heritage implications we have the cultural aspect. Uygur homes typically are very open airy affairs. Some have garden and rooftop areas suitable for outside seating. This is important to the Uygur. They relish the opennessss and it is a part of their culture to "entertain"  and have visitors and family around.  What they are offered by the Han, if they are lucky, is small units in multi-storeyed housing blocks. It is like caging a lion and the Uygur detest it. It literally is destroying the social and cultural fabric of their society and is  claimed, by the Uygur and their supporters, that these forced house evictions and demolitions are but one of the many "tools" being used in Han policy with the objective of achiving  the " cultural genocide " of the Uygur people.  These "small" incidences should not go unnoticed by the international community as they form part of a much wider picture of Han violations of the Human Rights of certain ethnic groups, the Uygurs in particular.

As background all of the three major Blog site providers in China were closed down completely recently (and I have not heard if they are back yet). Where before the Chinese censors would close down an "offending" site if it overstepped the political mark this time they have gone wholesale and closed down whole providers.  As well Chatrooms which are big in China have been getting just as rough scrutiny.People being redirected to other sites, posts being wiped etc.  Even searching for "offending" terms on search engines like Google ended up with the user facing a blank screen.   As you can imagine the internet "surfers" "Bloggers and 'Chatters' of China are furious and thus this article written by one of them in an attempt to understand the long term ramifications of this latest "purge".  There is much debate as to why this is happening. Some say that it was because of the recently completed National People's Congress, others the elections in Taiwan. Most likely it stemmed from a letter sent to the Politburo by an esteemed Beijing Doctor requesting them to re_appraise the Government's role in the Tiananmen Square Massacre which was leaked and caused much debate.  Whatever the reason the response is pretty huge by all accounts.  The future of the Internet in China? Who knows at the moment.   Linked Article Read Rating :   A Must

						      I have just installed a countdown clock counting the days, minutes and seconds till the Opening Day of The 2008 Beijing Olympics. (8/8/08)  I assume the Chinese chose that date for it's numbers with "8" being a very lucky number for the Chinese people. I am hoping that that day will also bring luck to those currently suffering Human Rights violations as well.  I want to draw attention to that date because I believe that between now and then will be the best time that perhaps there will be for a long time for the People's Republic of China to completely change it's views on human rights especially as it concerns the Uygur of Xinjiang and the Tibetans.  We must remain cognizant of this ticking clock and ensure that as hosts of the Games of Peace and Goodwill among men that the Chinese Government is continually reminded of it's obligations to humanity.  Let us hope that these Olympics do not bring with it additional suffering for the peoples of China.

						    China's Workers -- and Ours Date: 2004-03-17     urlLink China's Workers and Ours   I have much empathy for anyone who loses his job but I take umbridge when anyone hides behind a very shallow veneer of claiming they are doing something to protect someone else's Human Rights.  The Union at the center of this action is masking it's desire for "protectionism" behind a facade of caring for the Chinese workers.  China has what in the language of capitalism is called a "comparative advantage". It is exactly that which at one time or another every developing nation has had.  We saw it with the Japanese and Koreans and we are seeing it now with the Chinese and the Indians.  It is a developmental stage. As GDP and a nations wealth increase so too will the demands of labor in terms of wages and conditions. Up will slowly creep the labor components of cost and along with that price to the end user. Thus an initial comparative advantage will disappear and need to be replaced with one more sustainable.  Such an outcome is as certain as day and night.  In the meantime whilst the working class must labour in what we call "sweatshop" conditions they are improving their situations twofold. Firstly they receive income. Something is better than nothing. Secondly they are contributing to the accumulation of national wealth.  It is once national wealth reaches a certain "critical mass" that these "sweatshop" workers can bargain for improvements in wages and conditions. They can not do that until wealth has been accumulated. It is not a case of the chicken or the egg. It follows a well trodden path.  Now by calling for sanctions, economic penalties, tariffs or whatever, you can not say to any degree that you are helping these poor "sweatshop" workers. These actions will only lessen demand putting a downward pressure on wages and conditions as companies attempt to remain competitive at a rate return to justify their investment.  In an undeveloped country which China is, they do not have the excess capital be it human, intellectual or monetary to allow them to move easily from one means of production to another, from one industry to another.  Any attempt to "turn off the taps" now will not aid one iota the human rights of the Chinese worker. Their human rights are being advanced now by being able to take advantage of a "comparative advantage" they have now.  One can not live by the sword and not accept the possibility that one may die by it. That is what this claim by organised labor in the US and more than likely supported by their employers is attempting to do and disgracefully couching in terms of worrying about the other guy?   Get real fellows and treat us as the mature intelligent people we are and do not try to peddle this mean spirited garbage to us.   Linked Article Read Rating : A Must

						     urlLink China Daily       "A survey conducted recently in Ningbo, a coastal city in East China's Zhejiang Province, indicates that beggars are testing the limits of kind-hearted people's forbearance. "    Well it looks as though the poor people are getting up the nose (or should that be on the nose) of the  nouveau riche  in China.  This report provides harrowing reports of beggars actually accosting people as they walk the streets in China.   "They seem to have no shame," Tang says. "I do not know if he or she will jump on me the same way."   one person was reported to have cried.  I do not know really if beggars by nature have much shame, hunger maybe but no... Not shame.  And here is a cushy job,! How do you get this one:   "Ying Jianrong,  director of the district's Beggar Restriction Office,  believes that "99.9 per cent'' of the beggars in downtown Ningbo are not "real beggars.''    They needed an office and a director to determine that?  And how is this for a longwinded name for a law:   "Observers believe the recent increase of beggars in many Chinese cities has to do with the country's repeal of the 21-year-old  Measures for Internment and Deportation of Urban Vagrants and Beggars  last year.    I do not want to know what the "measures" were but it does not sound nice!  Then we probably have a voice of reason given what we know of poverty in China:   'Shen believes the only proper way to solve the problem is to reduce poverty through economic development, while better aiding poverty-stricken people through a more comprehensive social welfare system because the number of vagrants and beggars is likely to grow in the process of urbanization.    Then just to round it off we have this fine caring socialist type quote:   The existence of so many beggars has tarnished the image of the city, and their coercive begging has made them disgusting,''    says one gent with his nose out of joint.

						     urlLink Straits Times            "National People's Congress delegate Zhou Xiaoguang broke new ground recently when she took television advertisements seeking public views on what issues she ought to raise during this year's sitting of parliament."    The Straits Times journalist argues by providing some examples that the Representatives at the recently concluded  National People's Congress  are far more active in soliciting the opinions of their "constituents" than their predecessors and as such the NPC is not any longer the "Rubber Stamp" parliament that it has been.  Well from all reports there does appear more activity by the Representatives as the examples given would seem to attest. Many other examples were also supplied during the course of the Congress by the likes of the official Chinese news organs such as the  People's Daily.   That is all very encouraging and it would seem to be heading in the right direction, but let us remember that " democracy" is a learnt thing, an ingrained cultural thing. It can not be turned on at a drop of a hat or even at the direction of the Politburo.  It will take much education to bring the country up to speed on how to run a democracy even if the Party gave it's full support.  I have argued elsewhere in this blog that we are talking at least two generations and again that is only with the full support of the party.  At the moment the NPC remains a "Rubber Stamp" institution, that fact has not changed. What perhaps has changed is what some representatives see their role as being. If they see their role as being pro-active and act accordingly by getting out among their "constituents" (they are not universally elected) than it will ultimately put pressure on the party to reform. A grass roots revolution so to speak.  I do not know how widespread this new thinking is that the article describes but I would suggest at this stage that it is not very.   But, nevertheless promising.   Take a look at the article it gives some good insight into the process of the NPC.   Linked Article Read Rating : Worthwhile

The words of the  Dalai Lama  quoted from the linked Reuters story are not new. The Dalai Lama has long ceased to make "separation" from China his goal.  The realities for the Tibetans and the Uygur are such that "separation" or "splitting" as the Chinese call it is no longer an option for a variety of reasons.  The goal now must be to seek a degree of cultural autonomy and self determination within the Chinese state. To "free" the Tibetan and Uygur peoples from the extreme Human Rights privations they have laboured under for so long.  I am sure the opening quote is not reflective of the only reason the the Lama has for his postion but it is one that is not given enough recognition. Provided with the right conditions the economic future  and welfare of Xinjiang and Tibet and therefore the indiginous peoples would be much greater within China than without her.

						     urlLink Radio Free Asia :     "The Chinese government is planning sweeping educational changes in the northwestern region of Xinjiang which will force around 50 ethnic minority schools to merge with Chinese schools, imposing Chinese as the language of instruction on Uyghur and other minority schoolchildren, RFA's Uyghur service reports. "    One of the fastest ways to kill a culture is to deny it it's language. By denying a culture it's language you deny it it's history. You rob it of it's richness and stop it from handing down "oral" histories that are vitally important in keeping any culture alive and vibrant.  The Uygurs and their supporters have long argued that one tool in the Chinese government's toolbox for cultural 'genocide" is their limiting of the use of the Uygur language.  We have heard that the Chinese government has outlawed higher learning in the Uygur language, no university classes can any longer be conducted in it. We have heard that Uygur language books have been burned and been prohibited from publication.  All these things are true.  But even though I am an avid supporter of the Uygur's human rights and attempt in a small way to defend their unique and beautiful culture, I am a realist.  Language is important, of that there can be no argument, but as to whether languages of minorities, be they the Uygur in China or immigrants in Australia or the U.S, should take precedence over the state language I can not agree.  For better or for worse the reality of the situation of the Uygur is that Xinjiang is a Chinese state and despite the yearnings of many is likely to remain that way for many  generations to come.  The Uygur in diaspora and no doubt at home will seize on this report as further evidence of Chinese anti-Uygur policies but we have to be fair. The report mentions only some 50 small schools of which it would appear cater for several minorities. Given their size, ethnic mix  and possibly remote location  it can not reasonably be expected that the government provide Uygur language only tuition.  It is to be noted that up to a certain age the Uygur are allowed to send their children to Uygur language schools where students are instructed in all their subjects in the Uygur language. These are government funded schools.  Here in Australia ethnic minorities are allowed to set up there own private schools and whilst these schools do still receive a level of funding there is a rather large private contribution required from that community.   As well, they can choose whatever language they wish for instruction however all compulsory examinations must be conducted in English and along the way they must meet certain literacy and numeracy skills, this of course means there has to be abalance. This system seems to work quite adequately and happily.  So we have two different examples of ethnic minorities maintaining their language abilities, each in their way achieving the objective.  So, despite this announcement of the future of these fifty schools, the Uygur language is catered for to what I believe is an adequate level at least as it concerns lower level schooling. As it concerns Higher education I believe that it must be conducted in the language of the state, particularly as it concerns the Uygurs for their language unfortunately has not developed  a modern technical component. As well, Chinese will be the language that the higher educated Uygurs should be expected to use in their careers.  Having said that incidences as reported should be limited to unique cases and not become a rule. Any attempt by the Chinese government to water down the rights to  Uygur language usage at least at the lower levels of schooling must be vigorously opposed. Censorship of Uygur language books must be lifted. Restrictions on the private practicing of religion, and other cultural elements, in the Uygur language must be allowed.

I tend to side with this perspective though I do believe that economics can and should be used to bring pressure to bear on China to increase the rate of change in it's Human Rights policies. But this has to happen "upfront" not after a trade or investment relationship has been put in place as the U.S. unions are demanding.

						     urlLink Cheboygan Tribune        "WASHINGTON - Organized labor asked the Bush administration on Tuesday to impose economic sanctions on China, contending that the country has violated workers' rights in order to gain trade advantages against the United States."    The above article reports that for the first time in union history U.S. Organised Labour that it has attempted to seek redress against a foreign enterprise or country under a domestic U.S. Trade Law.  The report states  "The petition, filed by the  AFL-CIO  on behalf of its 13 million members, alleged that China was brutally repressing worker rights and this constituted an unfair labor practice as defined in Section 301 of Trade Act of 1974."    There has been much grumbling among Unions and Protectionists in the U.S. about the record $124 billion U.S. trade deficit with China last year and the loss of thousands of U.S. factory jobs as a result.   Similar concerns occurred in the seventies and eighties about the economic rise of Japan in foreign trade.  I can empathise with the Union's position and I agree that "sweat shop" labour is being used in China, but we have to look for analogies in the history of Japan where similar conditions applied early on in their economic development. It is what economists call "competitive advantage". As National Income rises, however, 'wage and conditions' demands follow suit and "sweat shop" economies gradually disappear as they have done in Japan.  It is vitally important for the long term Human Rights of workers that they have the opportunity to work in the first place. Any trade sanctions or tarriffs will put a downward pressure on wages and conditions in China as companies fight to remain competitive. The end result will only be the worsening of the human rights situation of the workers.  Unfortunately capitalism and the laws of supply and demand dictate these things. If one champions capitalism and free trade, as the U.S. does, one has to live with it's consequences, meaning, that the U.S. either gets out of those industries that it is not competitive with China in or becomes more efficent in those industries.

In this context it is hard to grasp why they revert to traditional hard-line authoritarianism in dealing with the issue of democracy in Hong Kong and Taiwan."    The above quote is from an article analysing the current state of affairs between the mainland and Hong Kong and Taiwan.  I am no expert on these relationships but the quoted text drew me to comment.  One of the things I find incredibly exasperating in looking at China is the lack of consistency in policy and implementaion. The Government can say and do things one day that make you think "Yes, things are changing" then the next day they will do something that makes you scratch your head in total bewilderment and exasperation.  This lack of consistency makes you, as a first response, necessarily  doubt everything that they say,rather than the more positive attitude of giving them the benefit of the doubt.  I have said that I hold great hopes for Wen Jiabao and his ability to transform China however when push comes to shove you may see a very different side of the man.  In relation to this story I can assure you of one thing and it is something that I have tried to get across to my friends in Xinjiang who dream of a separate autonomous state for the Uygur people, the Chinese will never give up one square inch of ground which they either occupy or claim.  I believe that they will go to any lengths to ensure this outcome and I mean any lengths. They will, if pushed to the wall on issues of territory ownership commit acts that would not be considered  rationale in a western sense. They will have no care as to international opinion or the effects on international trade or relations.  Like a tamed wild animal when threatened they will revert to the wild state in spite of years of apparent docility and acquiescence.   Beware the Dragon stirred.

						      The genesis of the recent historical amendments to the Chinese constitution concerning Human Rights and private ownership of property may well have occurred at a September 29 2003 meeting of the Politburo.  According to an article by Philip P Pan (Chinese Leadership Speaks of Reform but How Quickly?- Washington Post 14 March 2004) at this meeting two Law academics were invited to present a briefing on options for the reform of China's political system to the members of the Chinese politburo. As a result this was more than likely the formal introduction to the politburo of the thinking of the then new President and Premier Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao.  It was the formal beginning of what Pan calls a  'searching for a new political model for China'.   The new kids on the bloc Hu and Wen had sensed, as indubitably many others within the politburo had, that unless they effected change to the rigid and essentially corrupt political and judicial systems, that China, sooner rather than later, faced a potentially explosive political and social situation. A situation that not only would announce an end to the party but indubitably bring untold hardship, suffering and death to a large number of the Chinese people and unleashing a tide of events unimaginable as to it's scope and consequence.  This search for a model that will avoid this eventuality has two criteria. It must be able change the system for the better and it must, in doing so, maintain the power and hegemony of the Chinese Communist party.  Pan quotes  Li Lam , one of the two academics to address the Politburo on that day, as saying  'The bottom line of any political reform is that it must maintain the leadership of the communist party. The question is how we can make the Party, more clean, more honest, more efficient and more powerful?'   It is obvious then that this new system or model of government must necessarily fall somewhere between the two extremes of a western/capitalist/democratic model and the maxims of Marx and Lenin.  It can not totally embrace a democratic system because such a system would not guarantee the predominance of the Communist party nor, it is believed, could such a system adequately handle the uniqueness and the considerable number of socio-economic problems that arise from such a huge and diverse population. Especially one facing rapid economic transformation as well.  The latter is compounded  by the fact that a truly democratic system is completely foreign to the history and culture of the Chinese people. You only have to look at the relative failure of true democracy in the Central Asian Republics to get a feel for that. They, like the Chinese, had never experienced democracy in all their histories either as modern states or as clan/tribal communities.  As the Party searches for or attempts to evolve a new system Hu and Wen have at least been 'seen' to be effecting change both internationally and at home.  In an article in the LA Times ('Populism Percolates in China' LA Times 13 March 2004) author Ching-Ching Li cites a number of events where Hu and Wen have sidestepped historical precedents and have attempted introduce a degree of 'populism' into the leadership and therefore the party.  Visits to farmers, miners and Aids sufferers. Tours of SARS effected areas, emphasis on the plight of rural and migrant workers, crackdown on official corruption and perks. Release of political 'prisoners of conscience' and floated reforms to the sentencing and prosecution policies and procedures of the judiciary.   All in all having a decided 'glasnost' feel about it  This populism is seen as an important change in the style of the Government far more akin to the western democratic models of Presidents and Prime Ministers than the heretofore detached attitude of previous leaders.  Ching-Ching Li believes that this new attitude is being taken on board by the Chinese people:  'Most Chinese have come to see these acts not as merely public relations gestures but as genuine signs of change' he states   This would mean that ideological slogans of the government such as  'Wei renmin fuwu'  (`Serve the people') are being listened to and believed, at least to the extent that they evidence a desire to change.  On the international level the Chinese leadership has travelled tirelessly on the foreign circuit to 'sell' the 'New China' and get the message of  'heping jueqi'  (peaceful rise' or 'peaceful ascendancy') across to it's regional neighbours and concerned major powers. This too has not gone unnoticed at home.  Even last years first manned space flight was symbolic of this new breed of Government, notwithstanding that it's timing was quite co-incidental though nonetheless providential.  As icing on the cake we have the recently completed National People's Congress which, by and large, turned out to be a resounding political success for the ruling regime.   At that congress two important amendments to the constitution were 'rubber stamped' into law, namely the right to private ownership of property and the enshrinement of the concept of Human Rights.  It is amazing that such important constitutional amendments have either gone totally unremarked or acknowledged only with a grain of salt by a majority of commentators and analysts. The United States for example a long time critic of Chinese Human rights policy has been silent on the issue, no congratulations no well wishes, nothing.  Reporting generally has varied from a straight reporting of the facts, to half hearted analysis providing conclusions more often than not that the amendments are mere 'window dressing' and that by reasons of convention or legal effectiveness are worthless.  This latter conclusion may well be true. There is certainly not a lot of positive history of the constitutional 'guarantees' that existed before today. You need only look at the 'guarantee' on religious freedom to find support for these arguments, however to be fair these were drafted in a much different era then we face now and previous regimes have been a little harder than this one seems to be.  Despite the arguments as to their ineffectiveness, the importance of these amendments must be seen in greater terms than just their actionability for legal protection or redress.  Their historical significance at this juncture lies not in the mechanics but in the theory, in the concept.  It does not 'matter' whether a poor farmer from Gansu is unlikely to get past first base in any action brought under these clauses, it matters only that he thinks that he has this protection and could if he wished.  It does not 'matter' that millions of Chinese may never benefit from the private ownership laws by virtue of their impoverishment, it matters that they see that their children and grandchildren may.   What matters to them will be the 'concept' and the 'expectation' rather than the actuality.  The beauty of freedom is not in actually having to exercise it but 'believing' that you can if you wish. By a person 'believing' that he has a freedom then that person's whole attitude changes on a host of planes.  By 'believing' attitudes change, horizons broaden and expectations increase. These constitutional amendments, whether they are real in intent or mere sops to the populace, will without fail raise the expectations of the Chinese people.   Whether it realises it or not, the CCP has put in place a catalytic factor that will impel them, willingly or not, to implement further changes. Once the bar has been raised it can only rise, it can not so easily come down.  Despite what has happened over the last twelve months in China, and despite the positives as a result of  the passing of those two amendments, the Chinese will not march on to full democracy in the western sense, nor should it be expected to. It is not in the nature of the party or for that matter the people. They will however evolve a governmental model that will sit much closer to western ideals then Marxist-Leninist ones.  It will not happen overnight you only have to witness the contradictions seen every day in policy administration to understand that there is an educational process to be undertaken. The old "party hacks' will have to die out, the current leadership will have to sell these  'New China' ideals, their children must be taught acceptance and then and only then will their their grandchildren be raised knowing nothing of the old wiles.  We are not talking therefore five years, not even ten, we are talking at least two generations, however, barring anything cataclysmic, it will happen and these amendments will one day be judged rightly for the true historic importance they deserve.

						   The three Tibetan hungers strikers encamped outside the United Nations building in New York have entered day 27 of their protest with an open letter to the Secretary General of The United Nations Mr. Kofi Anann.  In their letter to Anann they state;     After 27 days, we are no longer hungry for food, only for freedom and justice.    With the antics of the United Nations Human Rights Commission as evidenced by China and other less than lily white countries ganging up to derail the United States' resolution condemning China's Human Rights record one wonders if the following words may be  true not only for the Tibetans but for many oppressed people such as the Uygur of Xinjiang.     We worry about the signal the United Nations is sending to the younger generations of our people. They grow increasingly frustrated and ask themselves whether a nonviolent movement will bring them the justice they hunger for. Your Excellency, please show them that violence and terror are not the sole means of compelling the United Nations to act. Please show them that you value peaceful perseverance and nonviolent methods.    The United Nations is becoming increasingly irrelevant to a younger generation of people world-wide, not only of the oppressed.

The forestation project, to build a total 446-km long and 74-m wide green wall, started in August 2003 to protect the desert highway from the intrusion of sand.       Eighty-nine percent of the desert highway, which was built in 1995, is located in a quicksand area.       Some 20 million trees will have been planted along the desert highway when the whole forestation project is completed in 2005.       In the second half of this year, more than 130 hectares of broomrape, a rare-breed plant used only in Chinese medicine, willbe planted.       The forestation project involves an investment of approximately 220 million yuan (about 26.5 million US dollars), with an appropriation of 100 million (some 12 million US dollars) from thecentral government.

						         "Coal-related deaths dropped 25 per cent during January-April period with 1,267 deaths reported in 854 registered cases. The total output of coal was up 19 per cent up over the same period the previous year. "    So states an article in  China Daily  reporting on Workplace Accidents in the first Quarter 2004. Good news of course but as the Daily points out there has been no "serious" accidents involving the death of more than 30 miners. This may be more good luck than good management though. (I placed inverted commas around serious not only because it is a quote from the article but that it implies that accidents with less than 30 deaths are not considered "Serious"! Hopefully an indication of poor journalism not state thinking)  Overall Wang Xianzheng, an official of the  State Administration of Work Safety (SAWS) , confirmed Tuesday in his latest report that, so far this year, 287,884 industrial/workplace accidents of various types have occurred, with 38,189 people killed nationwide.     The  urlLink vice-premier Huang Ju    is reported as hoping     "authorities will do a better job in monitoring factors that could lead to potential accidents by developing contingent schemes, emergency rescue operations, and ensure professional quick-response rescue teams are well prepared".     As it concerns the Coal Mining industry I think it needs a little more than that. With output growing 19% per annum over same period last year and demand not likely to abate China should feel lucky that the figures for the first quarter are so favourable.The industry has inherent problems that can only be remedied by considerable focus on the industry by the central government in terms of policy making, injection of manpower and finances into the governments supervisory organs and implementation of realistic penalties including custodial sentences for negligence at all levels. It also requires shutdowns and production limits for a great many operations.  This is unlikely of course because the output of the coal mining industry is of preeminent importance to China's rapid growth. The Chinese government has demonstrated time and time again that it is willing to accept a trade off in lives for sustaining the economic rate of growth it is experiencing.

						         "China has shut down 8 600 internet cafes in the past two months as part of an ongoing crackdown on the media, state press said on Tuesday."    It's a great headline but it may not be as sinister as it first seems and as the linked article implies with its tie in to recent blog censorship.  In October last year the CCP announced a new "educational campaign" aimed at reaffirming Communist Party's control over the press, including television, print and the electronic media. For example, in terms of television the CCP encouraged that TV stations produce more programmes aimed at promoting the party's theme of atheism and denouncing "cult" religions.  The crackdown on internet cafe's deals with illegal or underground internet cafes that are unlicensed and therefore "unsupervised" by the state. I do not think  that we can view this as a censorship matter though it has that element of course.  It is aimed mainly at underage users who frequent such places for, among other things, the national obsession of internet gambling. They are the modern day "pool halls" of the east.   As well all establishments where the public can congregate need supervision as to such things as fire and safety.   I am sure that anyone plotting the overthrow of the Chinese communist  regimes can find less sordid venues or alternative means to do their dastardly plotting!

The Narat Airport is the 11th airport in Xinjiang.      The airport is 330 kilometers west of Urumqi, the regional capital. It will cost 156 million yuan (18 million US dollars) to build.   Simayi Teliwardi, chairman of the regional government, said the airport will help promote social and economic growth and national unity in Xinjiang and accelerate the region's tourist development.       As Narat is near the Swan Lake and on Kunas Grassland, a state-listed tourist attraction, it received 133,000 visitors last year,gaining 27 million yuan in tourist income. The number of tourists to the region grew at an annual rate of 30 percent in the past five years."

						       "Even if Chinas Constitution defends atheism, atheists have all but disappeared from the Communist Party, said a Chinese bishop, who asked not to be named, when commenting on the new Communist Party of China (CPC) regulations."     According to the linked article appearing in  Asia News     "since the beginning of the year, new CPC government leaders have been briskly working on eliminating corruption and religious belonging from among their ranks."     Apparently two new directives, " Regulations of Internal Supervision of the Communist Party of China " and  CPC Disciplinary Penalty Regulations " were circulated within the Party earlier this year in order to slow down    "the bleeding of strict marxist orthodoxy"    Two articles in particular were cited in the article:    Article 49 of the disciplinary penalty regulations states that party members who organize, lead or act as central figures in any cult or "semi-feudal superstitious" organization will be expelled from the Party.   Article 56 party members who organize or utilize religious activities to oppose the Party, to spark upheaval or damage the unity of the country also face expulsion. Less serious participation can be penalized via warnings or "education".    As well the article reports that last October (2003)  State Administration of Radio, Film and Television  sent out a series of directives urging all state broadcasting companies to produce programs promoting atheism and to denounce "deviant beliefs."  Despite this the unnamed Bishop states that many CCP members are religious but keep quiet in pursuit of    "promotion and the rice bowl"    I have heard anecdotal stories that  urlLink Muslim Uygurs  who work for the government in  urlLink Xinjiang  adhere reluctantly to the strict rules on public servants and religion but upon retirement increase their daily prayer sessions to " catch up " on all they missed in their public service careers.

						   According to the Chinese Foreign Ministry site China has recently held further talks with New Zealand which is doing everything other than offering 100 New Zealand princesses as tribute brides to the Chinese emperor to get into a Free Market arrangement with China.      On April 21, 2004, Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Yesui held consultation on security and disarmament with Michael Green, Deputy Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade of New Zealand.  Zhang made positive remarks on China-New Zealand relations, indicating that the Chinese side stands ready to develop comprehensive relations with New Zealand in various fields. Green noted that China and New Zealand have no fundamental conflicts of interests and the two countries have great potentials and good prospects for further development of their relations.   The two sides exchanged views in depth on global and regional security situation, counter-terrorism, non-proliferation, the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), UN peace-keeping operations, national defense policies and military exchanges of the two countries.      I had to cringe when my New Zealand cousins stated that they had " no fundamental conflicts of interest "  with the Chinese.   What? The New Zealanders do not see it as a conflict of interest China's treatment of the Uygurs, Tibetans and non sanctioned religious groups? Do they now fully support these policies? They must as they do not seem to conflict with New Zealands outlook any more.   Are China's and the New Zealanders interests mutual over a boy kidnapped from his country and spending his 15th birthday in virtual prison and secluded from the world (if the Panchen Lama is still alive even)?  Is the slaughter that is the Chinese coal mining industry not a conflict of interest?  Are you not, New Zealand, interested in Human Rights any more? Does not your "interest" in Human Rights conflict just a little with China's? Maybe a tad?   I support increased trade with China. It brings wealth to the Chinese people and helps to alleviate their poverty. It brings increased communications with the west and facilitates the sharing of democratic principals and ideals but, when shaking hands with the Chinese do not totally ignore the blood on them as if it did not exist.  Yes, trade by all means but can we not use trade to facilitate the speed of change in China? Can we not say "We want to do business but we do have some conflicts of interest" Can we not attempt to  obtain even the smallest of concessions? A political prisoner here a minor freedom there?    Do we have to strip ourselves completely naked and throw ourselves so wantonly on the bed of the Chinese economy and say we have "no fundamental conflicts of interests?"

						     An interesting  CBC Canada  interview with the  urlLink  Dalai Lama  currently visiting Canada on a lecture tour which has also included the controversial meeting with the  Canadian Prime minister Mr Paul Martin .  The Dalai Lama talks about why politicians around the world decide against meeting him and states that he is not at all unhappy with that situation much preferring to being seen as a spiritual leader rather than a political activist.     "I think 80 per cent of my energy and time is spent on spiritual field. I always introduce myself as a Buddhist monk. Nothing else. So when someone, they consider me as a Buddhist monk, I'm very happy. If someone considers me as a politician, that's not very correct."     One of the very peculiar aspects of China's rather strong reaction to the Dalai Lama being met by foreign politicians is that they claim that the Dalai Lama is a "separatist" whose goal it is to see an independent Tibet despite the fact that the  Lama has stated on many occasions since 1992 that he no longer advocates separation from China. In this interview he reconfirms this position quite plainly.     "..My main concern for Tibet is preservation of Tibetan culture, preservation of Tibetan spirituality. I'm not much concerned about political field, whatever political status, OK, so long the preservation of Tibetan culture, preservation of Tibetan spirituality and environment fulfilled, then political status doesn't matter. Not much important. Personally, I have no interest in the political status of these things. I made it very clear, I think in '92, I made it very clear, when time comes for our return with certainty of freedom, then I will hand it over, all my religious authority to the local government."     It is as if the Chinese Government  wish to continue painting the Dalai Lama as a threat to China's unity perhaps to justify their actions in Tibet. Like the Uygur and the non existent " Uygur Terrorism " it provides them with a degree of at least "self justification " for their actions and policies towards these peoples.   The Lama also speaks in the interview of when he considers the use of violence or force as a legitimate tool  and uses historical analogies of the war against Nazism as an example of justifiable force. In general though he has a very simple rule advocating " gentle violence ":  "   If someone try to shoot on you, then there is no possibility to run away, then you have to hit back. Then possibly not on head, but leg or something like that. So that's not serious hit back, but more lenient way, more gentle way.

The  newly formed  World Uyghur Congress  first president was named as  Erkin Alptekin  son of famed Uygur Nationalist  Yusaf Alptekin  who fled Xinjiang with the takeover of the Chinese Communist party and conducted an international campaign for Uygur independence from then until his recent death.

Mr Isa is ranked number 3 in China's " most wanted terrorist " list and has held the position of president of the  Uygur Youth Congress  which is listed by Beijing as a "Terrorist Organisation" along with the  East Turkistan Information Center  which was also represented at the conference.  The main objective of WUC according to the press release will be      "to promote the right of the Uyghur people to use peaceful, nonviolent, and democratic means to determine the political future of East Turkestan".     To achieve this goal the organisation plans to      "  closely cooperate with concerned foreign governments such as the U.S., Britain, Germany, Russia, and international bodies such as the UN, European Union as well as human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch etc."    The new WUC claims that  since the  9/11 terrorist attacks in the U.S., the Chinese government has      hijacked the global war on international terrorism and has stepped up its  Strike Hard  campaigns aimed at terrorizing the entire Uyghur population. The Chinese government also branded almost all the Uyghur organizations in the world as terrorist and attempted to dismantle them with the help of the international community."      Platform of Non Violence and International Co-Operation   Despite several member associations of the newly formed WUC being branded as "Terrorist" organisations by the Chinese Communist Party  the WUC has declared that it will attempt to achieve it's aims through a policy advocating non violence and adherence to international standards.     "The World Uyghur Congress declares a nonviolent and peaceful opposition movement against Chinese occupation of East Turkestan and an unconditional adherence to the international accepted human rights standard as laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and internationalonal Covenant on Political, Economical, Social and Cultural Rights,adherence to the principals of democratic pluralism and rejectof totalitarianismnism, religious intolerance, and terrorism as an instrument of policy."    At the conclusion of conference a protest rally was staged outside of the Chinese Consulate in Munich to draw attention to the on going Human Rights abuses of the Chinese Government against the Uygur people in Xinjiang and the denouncing of legal Uygur diaspora organisations as "Terrorist groups"

						        "The increased presence of Chinese people and companies all over Central Asia is becoming a 'fait accompli'. "    So says the  Times of Kyrgyzstan  in an article that looks at China's  'peaceful rise' " as the most dominant nation not only in greater Asia but Central Asia as well.  My area of  interest has always been the Uygur people of Xinjiang, the Turkic Muslims that inhabit China's north western "province" that borders four Central Asian nations.  The Uygur being Turkic and having more in common with the likes of  urlLink Bishkek  than Beijing in terms of history, language and culture has made watching  developments in Central Asia of some importance to me.  Unlike some I have always thought that the dominant force in Central Asia would be either  Russia , with it's history and knowledge in the area,  India  with it's desire to gain a foothold in this strategically important area, or,  China  for, well, all of the above. I believed that whilst America seems to have the upperhand now due to her involvement in Afghanistan this would gradually change and ultimately the US would be relegated to the reserve bench.  But, still I thought that both Russia and India would hold the top two places and China would run a distant third mainly because of cultural differences. I felt the central Asians would be far more comfortable dealing with Russia, India and Europe than China.  Lately however I have had call to revise my earlier assessments and now place China squarely at the top of the pecking order.  There are two reasons for this change of heart. Firstly and foremost is China's great need for energy resources. As China continues to expand at it's current astronomical rate energy will be it's prime motivator in international affairs and trade. Where the energy is so will be China. The Central Asian countries are rich in energy resources that still remain under utilised and I believe the Chinese will wave whatever size carrot is needed to gain greater access to these resource and guarantee it's long term supply.  Secondly, the Chinese have an advantage over the other contenders, if they choose to make use of it, in as much as the Uygur people sharing many similarities with the Central Asians could be of great assistance in making further inroads into these countries. Already as a result of Russian and Soviet involvement in Xinjiang over the course of history and with refugees escaping Chinese oppression since 1949 there are several hundred thousand Uygurs already resident in Central Asian countries, many in business.  The Uygurs in Central Asia  however are not universally loved despite their "kinship" with the Turkic peoples there. Of recent years the Central Asian countries have, in their drive to create close economic relations with China, taken very much to heart the Chinese claim of the existence "Uygur Terrorism" throughout Xinjiang and Central Asia. Many Uygur have been forcibly sent back to China, many to jail and some even to execution. People of Uygurs ancestry are often referred to as "Uygur terrorists' despite in some instances the families have been in their new homelands for over 100 years. As well the success of the Uygurs in business has led to some hostility and resentment toward them.  Appropriate treatment of the Uygur by the Chinese however could do much to "rehabilitate" the Uygur in the eyes of China's Central Asian neighbours and prove in the long term to be of invaluable use in China achieving ascendancy in the region.

						         Falun Gong practitioners in Beijing’s Tuanhe Labor Camp stuff chopsticks into paper wrappers labeled “Sanitized for Your Safety.” They haven’t washed their hands for days.   There is no water.   Dozens of prisoners are crammed together in a tiny room where they sleep, eat, go to the bathroom and pack chopsticks. Some of the chopsticks fall on the floor and are stepped on. Others fall into the toilet basin.   Not a single stick can be thrown away, so they are picked up and stuffed in wrappers just the same, ready to be sold to restaurants in China and abroad.   Practitioners squat on the floor for 18 hours a day stuffing up to 10,000 pairs of chopsticks each.

						       I have had the pleasure of attending a lecture earlier this year by Professor Colin Mackerras of Griffith University, Australia who is a China expert with a special understanding and interest in  urlLink Xinjiang   and the  urlLink Uygur people.   Professor Mackerras along with Prof Dru Gladney of the University of Hawaii can always be relied upon to bring reason to the debate on the situation of the Uygur in Xinjiang especially as it concerns what China calls " Uygur Terrorism "  Professor Mackerras' latest offering printed in  Asia Times Online  is an insightful look through his eyes at the current situation in Xinjiang gleaned from a recent "field trip", one of many he has made to Xinjiang over the years.  Whilst I do not totally agree with everything the professor says I find that he brings to his work a "self honesty" that is not often found among "Xinjiang experts" who usually appear to "play to an audience". Which "audience" seems to depend on which side of the " Terrorist" fence they perceive their target market to sit.  My only reservations with professor Makerras’ summation of the situation in Xinjiang relate to my old hobby horses,  Religious extremism  and “ "Uygur terrorism" ”.  Regular readers of the China Letter will know that I, without one iota of hesitation,  believe that “ "Uygur terrorism" ” is non existent and that "religious fundamentalism" with all it's negative connotations is no more or no less common among the Uygur than say Christians in America or elsewhere.   Professor Mackerras states in his article that he believes that events like suicide bombings, as allegedly occurred in Uzbekistan recently, and other similar violence in Xinjiang are    "possible but unlikely"  . In that I am in full agreeance. What I disagree with is his reasons for them being "unlikely"  Professor Macakerras claims in the article that this type of occurrence is unlikely because the Chinese have now such a firm hold on the region through their combined policies of " carrot and stick " that the Uygur can not act. I dispute that this is the reason as I feel that it is "unlikely" due to my belief  that violence generally is just not in the makeup of the Uygur people. Quite simply they are not predisposed culturally or from a religious viewpoint to this type of activity.   Since 1949 and the Communist takeover they have had many opportunities when Han Chinese control has not been as tight as it is today to engage in such activities. During the  urlLink  Great Leap Forward  of the 50's and the  urlLink Cultural Revolution  extreme hardship and religious persecution was visited upon the Uygur but they did not respond violently, at least not in a ways we would call "terrorist activity" or even armed insurgency.  The professor mentions the  Barren incident  of 1990, the  Yining incident  and  Urumqi bus bombings   of 1997 and states that    "There is no doubt that on the whole the disturbances of the 1990s were indeed inspired by separatists, many of them deriving inspiration from Islamic militants.    I would agree with him that these incidences had a separatist dimension and may have drawn impetus from separatist notions once underway but disagree that religion per se was a driver.  I think we need to take a step back in thinking of the Uygur in Xinjiang and revisit the core situation.  The Uygur justifiably are the indigenous people of Xinjiang, despite protestations to the contrary by the Chinese, I think most people agree that this is a given. They are also a deeply religious people in the vein of many religious people worldwide, Christians or whoever, but are not, ergo, “religious militants”  or "fundamentalists" in the negative way this term  connotes in modern idiom.   Since the Communist takeover they have endured severe attacks on their culture , Professor Mackerras rightly points out more so then even the Tibetans who are a " Cause celebre" because of their treatment at the hands of the Chinese. Their position in their "own country" has been significantly diminished beyond most peoples comprehension and their religion has been overtly persecuted. I do not think anyone could disagree on those points. (other than the Chinese of course)  From the breakup of the Soviet Union and through the 1990’s Han oppression and persecution  of the Uygur increased tenfold as a result of the Chinese fear that the Uygur could take the cue from their Central Asian “brothers” and attempt to separate from China. Simple demonstrations of protest or dissent which is a fundamental right in "free" countries therfore were brutally suppressed by the Han. The Yining demonstration of 1997 alluded to by Professor Mackerras and which flared with horrendous results for the Uygur, if taking place in a “free country” would have most likely have come to a reasonable and peaceful  conclusion.  The Uygur have a legitimate right given all that has occurred to them to dissent from Han policy and even Han presence in Xinjiang. The right to dissent and the right to resist oppression and persecution is recognised universally as a basic human right. The right to bear arms is also generally recognised as a valid and legal response in situations where extreme coercion exists.  Oppressed peoples, unlike nation states, do not have armies at their disposal to defend themselves from attack. They historically do so through riot, armed rebellion, guerilla warfare and the like. Blowing up infrastructure for example in such situations is not (or prior to "9/11 at least) considered terrorism.   I have to continually hark back to and draw conclusions from the American's "War of Independence" when thinking of the Uygur and Xinjiang.  How was that war conducted initially?  Through riot, armed rebellion and guerilla warfare.  Was that a justifiable response to British "oppression’? Does what the British did to the Americans compare  to the situation of the Uygur and Han today? Are the Uygur any less justified, then the Americans of the 18th century, given their treatment at the hands of the Chinese government to resist?   I will leave you to compare both scenarios.  The Urumqi bombings of 1987 appear to be the only acts carried out by Uygurs that were pre-meditated and designed to cause civilian casualties. I personally can not condone the hurt to innocent civilians but acknowledge that this came in the aftermath and as a direct response to the Yining riots that saw thousands of Uygurs illegally detained, martial law imposed in Uygur cities, severe crackdowns on the rights of association,  religion and communication and upwards to 124 executions of Uygurs, many hurried and many of young people. In other words in an incredibly chaotic and fluid atmosphere. If that situation, on top of the general repression that the Uygur have lived under since 1949, is not considered justifiable cause to provoke a "valid and legaL" response to severe coercion what is?   Yes there were elements of separatism and religion in all these events but they were not inspired by them. I categorically refute that religion is a prime motivator as most commentators, even  Professor Mackerras, suggest. The Uygur were/are oppressed, discriminated against and persecuted on all planes; religion, economics, culture and race. Each and every one have played a part in the Uygur's actions and reactions, none more none less.  I wonder sometimes if it is  because the Uygur are Muslim that resisting religious persecution is considered evil or "terrorist" and  that the religius dimension is so often invoked in analysing the Uygur's situation. Are the Christians in China resisting Chinese persecution evil? I think not. Have the Uygur not the fundamental right to peacefully follow their religion or resist it’s persecution just because of the fact that they just happen to share that religion with some inherently evil people like Bin Laden?  All in all though Professor Mackerras’ observations are pretty valid and as I said inject a voice of level headedness and reason in the “Uygur Question” debate and are well worth reading and following.

						         "The U.N.'s top human rights body moved on Wednesday to increase scrutiny of how the so-called 'war on terror' is being waged worldwide by appointing a special investigator to monitor governments' actions."    Well the United States proposed resolution on China's Human Rights record has been defeated ( as everyone knew it would) but surprisingly the U.N. has agreed to appoint a "special investigator" to scrutinize how the "War on Terror" is being used by unscrupulous governments to mask their own human rights violations. I say surprisingly as this move was also expected to meet the same opposition from the same people that the U.S initiative met.  Two countries that come to mind in my neck of the woods that have used the "War" to mask their treatment of people and groups is China obviously with their treatment of the  urlLink Uygur people of Xinjiang"  and the dictator Karimov in Uzbekistan with his drive against all things Muslim and any political opponents.    The respected Human Rights organisation   urlLink Human Rights Watch   in an article applauding the move cites some examples of what is entailed     Abuses committed in the name of fighting terrorism include prolonged, incommunicado detention without judicial review; torture and other physical and psychological mistreatment of detainees; the transfer, return, extradition, expulsion and physical mistreatment of persons at risk of being subjected to torture; and the adoption of security measures that discriminate and curtail freedom of expression and association.      I would hasten to add to that list  executions . In the case of the Uygur many have received the bullet in the back of the head as a  result of claimed "terrorist activities". For example as a direct consequence of a peaceful demonstration in the Uygur city of Gulja (Yining) in 1997 that turned ugly as a result of alleged Chinese over-reaction it is claimed approximately 124 Uygurs were executed the last one only in October of last year.   I have not been alone in arguing that the " War on Terrorism ", in itself a just and right cause, has been to the detriment of countless millions of innocent people and that in our "War" we have run the risk of " throwing the baby out with the bathwater "  The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has now said in its Geneva sittings that any " response to terrorism " must " conform to international treaties on human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law " and will appoint an investigator to head up monitoring of the consequences of "counter terrorism" measures.  Cheers to the U.N and I mean that sincerely as against my  cheers to the FBI  from an earlier post today.

						        In my article  urlLink The Guantanamo Numbers: China's Duplicity Unmasked  I argued that if Xinjiang's Muslim Uygurs had such a close connection with the  Taliban  and  al Qaeda  as China has claimed ad nauseum since "9/11" surely many must have been captured by the Americans in Afghanistan?  Afghanistan shares a border with Xinjiang so it's only a stones throw away from a supposed 9.25 million " restive Uygurs " and " Uygur Terrorist " organisations. If I were a terrorist leader in Xinjiang or elsewhere surely I would have thought Afghanistan would have been the place to be for all my hundreds of followers ready to die for the cause! Nice and handy, Muslim brotherhood sort of thing, "shared ideology" with al Qaeda etc etc etc. Think of nowhere better to be could you?  But when the Guantanamo numbers were released how many of the 650 held by the Americans were Uygurs?  Well there were 30 Jordanians and Jordon is supposed to be an ally of America. There were 9 British citizens and they were  a long along way from home. There were even two Australians and two Canadians, not the sort of countries one would associate with Islamic fundamentalism and hatred for the west. And, don't forget all the other Arabs. So how many Uygurs then do you reckon? Remember before answering:  nice and close to Xinjiang, " restive people " so says the worlds press, " Islamic extremists and terrorists " so say the Chinese. So how many? 100, 50?  12! That's right, only 12 less than 2%.  So much for China's propaganda about scores of well organised "Uygur terrorist" groups in league with al Qaeda and training with the Taliban.  Most of the world's commentators have always treated Chinese claims along these lines with a great degree of skepticism. Why? Because there has not been one skerrick of proof validated by any one else other then China. The U.S State department  when they worked with China in  2002 to have a little known Uygur group the East Turkistan Islamic Party (ETIM) listed as an international terror organisation could list no proof other than to say they based their support on  information  provided by the Chinese and some Russian "news articles". They even categorically admitted that this ETIM had never been involved in any violence outside of China.  Now we have a Director of the American FBI visiting China currently coming out and saying that " some people in China share the same ideology as al Qaeda ". When pressed as to whether  he meant the Uygur he reiterated his "some people' statement:      "There certainly are individuals in China who could be described as having that same mindset as well as the desire to utilize terrorist acts to further their agenda, whether you would call it al Qaeda or a group loosely affiliated with al Qaeda and al Qaeda's leadership."     Whilst not saying outright yes his lack of a no  pretty well  inferred that it was the Uygur  whom he was alluding to.  Well Mr Mueller there are probably "some people" in The United States who share a "common ideology" with al Qaeda. Given the extensive list of nationalities captured in Afghanistan like the British, Canadians and Australians to name just a few a few I would say there are "some people" in many parts of the world that "share common ideologies" with al Qaeda. That does not mean that their peoples and countries are Terrorists, because that through your "politic" statement is what you have inferred here about the Uygur.  You have, by your lack of courage in answering the question more fully, once again branded the Uygur as terrorist and no doubt in doing so put a huge smile on the collective face of the Chinese government. A Director of the FBI no less allowing the less informed in the world to believe that the "world renowned" FBI thinks that there exists an  Uygur terrorist threat.  I can hear the collective sigh of 9.25 million Uygurs in China and a million around the world right now. "Not again?" they will be asking "why are we being branded so? What have we ever done to the world to deserve this?"  Three cheers for the FBI and enjoy your Peking Duck Mr Mueller. (Great Wall looks good this time of year!)      urlLink Yahoo!

						         "Suicide is the number one killer of people aged 15-34 in China, particularly young women in rural areas."    According to the linked article in VOA News suicide is the number one killer of people in China between the age of 15 and 34. Whilst in relative terms the youth suicide rate in China is below most western countries the absolute values given China's size are immense.  Some 250,000 people commit suicide on China each year and there are over two million attempts. That's the population of say a city the size of Sydney attempting to take their own lives each year.  What further stands out from this article is that the rate of suicides among woman is higher than for males which goes against world trends.  Female suicide is also more prevalent among the poor rural based women. It would appear also that the rate of "successful" female suicides compared to other countries is as a result of the type of methods used and there availabilty such as poisoning by the likes of pesticides used commonaly in rural applications.  Many suicides reportedly are as a result of failing to achieve such as in school or work a problem associated with developing countries.   As in most areas of health service in China mental health and suicide counseling services are very light on the ground particularly in rural areas.

"    The report finds that to meet this growing challenge of an aging population, China must implement an old-age safety net and establish a genuinely funded pension system.   The Graying of the Middle Kingdom report in PDF is available  urlLink  here    The report finds that   "the magnitude of China's coming age wave is staggering." "By 2040 there will be 397 million Chinese elders, which is more than the total current population of France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United States combined. How China navigates its aging challenge will go a long way toward determining whether it achieves its aspiration of becoming a prosperous and stable developed economy."    The " One Child Policy " is having an enormous effect on age distribution in China's demographics. Already experts have given warning about the possible effects on society of a situation developing where there will be an excess of 20 million males of marriageable age by 2050.  As well in an article on a related subject warnings are out about the possible problems associated with the rapid aging of the population as it concerns social security and pensions.  In an article entitled  urlLink China must rethink pensions or face crisis :  it states that    "Glaring shortcomings in China's basic pension system could leave tens of millions of people destitute in old age and provoke a crisis unless the government re-thinks its reforms, a U.S. think tank said on Monday."    All of this is exacerbated by the fact that the "one child" policy will have denied a generation of parents, especially the poor and those from rural areas, a traditional  source of income support, that of a large family.

						     Like all authoritarian regimes and excessively bureauracratic governments throughout history officials taking personal responsibility for outcomes has not been high on the agenda. From the "I was just following orders" type of thing through to blaming subordinates for all that is wrong has typified such regimes.  In China there have not been too many people willing in the past to stand up and say that the "Yuan stops here"  It is this lack of personal responsibility this lack of "ownership" of outcomes that is at the core of many of China's ills.  The coal mining industry for example that kills upwards of 10,000 people per year through lax mine safety, poor training etc is a prime example of the lack of personal responsibility.  The mine owners do not take the responsibility to ensure safe working conditions, government officials supposedly charged with responsibility of overseeing safety do not take personal responsibility. Graft and corruption is rife in the industry because it is always someone else's responsibility to fix. As a result many people die and countless thousands are hurt or are impacted upon by death and injury.  Countless examples exist where many lives have been lost and mine owners and officials have been able to walk away with nary a slap on the wrist and return back to their old jobs and old ways.  Things may be changing however according to the linked article from the  People's Daily . Some corporate and government high fliers have been forced by public opinion of late to fall on their swords and it would appear the general populace are appreciative and want more.  Transparency and accountability should become two by-words for attention by China's leadership and I am sure that the Chinese government can give it some great catchy name like the "Two Principles Theory" or whatever.  Changes along these lines are evident and it is hoped that they can be accelerated.   urlLink Will 'take the blame and resign' become a usual practice?

At least the Mine's owner has been detained for questioning!     The major fire took place down the shaft with Linkeng Colliery,a privately-owned mine in Daji Village around 10:30 hours last Wednesday. After the accident took place, a special on-the-spot headquarters for the rescue operations was set up, and more than 200 people were sent to help the rescue the miners trapped beneath the ground.

						       Representatives of Uygur diaspora groups have been meeting in Munich Germany over the weekend of the 16th and 18th April at the annual  United General Assembly of East Turkestan National Congress.   The annual three day Congress draws representatives from Uygur organisations in up to 15 countries for the election of office holders and to discuss short and long term strategies for the promotion of the Uygur cause worldwide.  Among the groups attending the conference are the  East Turkestan (Uyghuristan) National Congress (ETNC) , the  World Uyghur Youth Congress (WUYC)  and the  East Turkistan Information Centre (ETIC)   ETNC was established in October 1999 as an international umbrella body, and the WUYC in October 1996 to represent the Uyghur Youth worldwide.   According to their public platforms the ETNC, WUYC and ETIC disavow violence and declare adherence to human rights standards laid down in the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant and Political Rights and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.    The organisations are all legally registered in Germany and have been operating openly under the laws of the host country to    “promote, secure and lobby for the fundamental rights, to disseminate information about the human rights violations, to promote democracy amongst Uyghur people”.       China Labels Meeting "Terrorist"    Despite their open and legal status in Germany the Chinese government have labelled ETIC and WUYC as being  “terrorists” organisations and named their leaders as being wanted for “terrorism” activities within China.  On December 16, 2003 China released the names of four Eastern Turkistan organisations that it claimed were linked to  al-Qaeda  and had carried out “terrorist” activities within China. As well they named 11 ethnic Uygurs wanted on terrorist charges.   Among those organisations and individuals named were ETIC and the WUYC and their respective leaders  Abudujelili Kalakash  and  Dolqun Isa . Isa was named as number 3 on China’s terrorist “most wanted list” and Kalkash number 4.  As recently as Friday of last week China officially  “warned” German officials about the conference of the East Turkestan groups in Munich which Beijing describes as    "terrorist activities"    According to a Chinese spokesperson quoted by Xinhua the official Chinese newsagency ETIC and WUYC are meeting in Munich      “..with other 'Eastern Turkistan' separatist forces in order to set up a unified organisation for terrorist and separatist activities, which not only endangers China's unification and security, but also poses a potential threat to world peace, said the spokesman.”       Conference Address By UNPO General Secretary    The conference was addressed on it’s opening day by  Marino Busdachin, General Secretary of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation , an organisation set up as an alternative to the United Nations and representing indigenous peoples such as the Uygur and the Tibetans whose nationhood has been denied to them by external force.  In his opening remarks Busdachin said that UNPO commits its full support to  the Uyghur people in its    “struggle for freedom, democracy and the right to self-determination”.       Delegates To Demonstrate at Chinese Embassy    At the end of the General Assembly a  demonstration is planned  in front of the Consulate-General of the Peoples’ Republic of China in Munich to protest against the stepped up crack down in East Turkestan and the Chinese branding of  democratic Uyghur exile organisations as terrorists.

						        "Officials tout the blessings of communism, even though everyone, officials included, knows that communism no longer really exists in China. What does exist is an authoritarian government that is slowly losing control over its people and is unsure how to lead the country in the next millennium. "    I have taken this quote from an article by  Holly Krambeck who   currently resides in Beijing, where she works as an editor for China Today.   In the article the author looks at the history of China and trys to identify historical precedents and cyclical occurrences in China's long history in an attempt to analyse where China is going today.  Her bottom line is that the current Communist regime will be remembered for completing a cycle of  greatness, chaos, greatness   that she argues has dogged China since the Shang dynasty, in c.1500 b.c.   She believes China has been caught in a continuous cycle of dynastic rise and fall and that the Communist regime has taken China out of chaos but that it will be left to the regime that follows it to take China into the "greatness" phase of the cycle.

						        "China urged Germany Friday to stop activities by banned 'Eastern Turkistan' groups, and not to appease terrorism in any form.     I believe that the Chinese Government's constant attack on the name of the Uygur people of Xinjiang borders on being manic and must be reflective of their true feeling towards the people that they attempt to hide behind a mask of the " War On Terrror "  Apparently according to  Xinhuanet  a spokesman for the Ministry of Public Security has stated that some  "Eastern Turkistan terrorist" groups  are reportedly meeting in Munich Germany, including two terrorist organizations banned by China.   They claim these groups are meeting in order to set up a unified organization for terrorist and separatist activities against China.  Now the Uygurs number about 9.25 million in Xinjiang and  about one million in diaspora. This is juxtaposed with about the same number of Han Chinese in Xinjiang and many hundreds of millions elsewhere throughout China.  The Uygur are repressed and persecuted being subject to a many number of human rights violations that work effectively to destroy their collective will  for any confrontation with China,even if they were so desirous, which in my humble assessment they are not.  Uygur diaspora organisations are fragmented and to a great degree totally incapable of insinuating any  agendas on the Uygur or Xinjiang. Quite frankly they lack cohesion, funding and the ability to be able to project any meaningful power into Xinjiang. Publicly at least all of them proclaim as part of their "political platforms" peaceful solutions to the issue of Uygur independence.  With regard to " Uygur Terrorism " readers of my blog will know that I am of the opinion that Uygur terrorism does not and has never existed in any shape or form anywhere near that claimed by the Chinese government.   Yes, there has been violence inflicted by the Uygur on the Han and even on fellow Uygurs but these have  been at best opportunistic strikes, or strikes of retaliation against immense brutality, such as the Chinese response to the Yinning demonstrations in 1997 and do not meet the generally accepted criteria of  what constitutes "terrorism".  The Americans would balk at any suggestion that their "War of Independence" was a terrorist activity I am sure. As is oft said one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.  So I find it almost laughable that the quoted Chinese spokesperson claims that these alleged meetings in Munich not only endanger the " unification of China"  but claims also rather grandly I would have thought that it actually poses a threat to " World Peace ".   World peace nonetheless!  As a result of Chinese insistence and US payback for support for the "War on Terror" the PRC was able to have one alleged group, the  East Turkistan Islamic Movement  proscribed as an international "terrorist organisation" by the U.N.   This little known group that even the U.S State Department admits has never caused any violence outside of China ( and they admitted at the time they were relying on Chinese information proving terrorist acts within China) is the only internationally recognised Uygur "terrorist" group. All other groups and organisations identified by the Chinese government such as the  East Turkistan Information Centre  (ETIC) are diaspora organisations operating openly and legally in host countries such as Turkey and Germany. You can even visit ETIC's website but far from being a hotbed of terrorist intrigue you will find a dilapidated and non maintained site mainly archiving alleged Chinese human rights violations against the Uygur. Take a spin through your favorite search engine and search on the names that the Chinese constantly sprout as being terrorist groups inciting violence. You will find nothing but "cyber ship wrecks" of 1990's activism, if anything at all.  I have no doubts that among the world's 10 million odd Uygurs there are some who would like to plant a bomb in the Great Hall of China just as there are some Americans and British who would like to do the same at the  White House  or " Number 10 " These people however are few and far between, have no organisation and lack the wherewithal  to project any power in to China or affect "World Peace"  When will the Chinese cease this manic obsession with Uygur Terrorism?

						    This is a good article that summarises the " Throw the baby out with the bathwater " mentality of the world " War on terrorism "   It deals mostly with U.S. support of the highly un-democratic  Central Asian Republics  and Pakistan but touches on China and the Uyghur as well.   Whilst denouncing terrorism in any shape or form I feel that this incessant focus on  Bin Laden  and the ubiquitous  al Qaeda   has taken on a political life of it's own much to the detriment of many millions of people, the Uyghur and the Central Asians being  cases in point.

						    urlLink The Jamestown Foundation   I would like to take issue with several assertions made by Dr. You Ji in his article “ China’s Post 9/11 Terrorism Strategy” (The Jamestown Foundation. www.Jamestown.org 15/04/04) especially as they regard the issue of Uygur “terrorism” in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region in China..  In his article Dr Ji states that  “ China has not been free from transnational terrorist acts, with some Chinese minorities spurred into armed protest against the central government by ethnic separatism, Islamic fundamentalism and al-Qaeda's networks.”  He goes on to say   “..insurgents” for Xinjiang independence (Jiangdu) have launched successive attacks to destabilise Chinese rule since the late 1980s.”  Let us look at these totally unfounded statements. Firstly, that the Uygur as a people have been “spurred” into “armed protests” against the Han Chinese Government. Dr Ji’s choice of words would have the reader believe that the Uygur people as a whole are engaged in a continuing sizeable armed conflict with the Han Chinese with a view to destabilising Han rule. Nothing could be farther from the truth.  It is true that a majority of Uygurs consider the Han presence in Xinjiang/East Turkestan as being a colonial occupation. They believe that Han policies are detrimental to them as the indigenous peoples and that they are discriminated against as to race and religion. They also believe that it is the objective of Han policy to destroy Uygur culture to facilitate assimilation of the Uygur ethnicity into the Chinese nationality.  It is not true however that the Uygur people, as a whole or even in majority, support armed insurrection as a means of throwing off the yoke, as they see it, of Chinese rule. Yes, they would in their hearts long to see a free “East Turkestan” that is without doubt just as the Tibetans hold similar dreams. In that sense then they can be viewed as “separatists”. But holding a dream of “separation” from China and actually having the will or ability to enter into armed insurrection to achieve it is quite another thing.  Dr Ji’s asserts, rather poetically, that the Uygur are “spurred” on also, in whatever they are supposed to be doing, by “Islamic fundamentalism” as well as by association with the ubiquitous al Qaeda network. He then goes on to say that the Uygur and al Qaeda share common ideological goals.   I wonder if the good Doctor has actually ever been to Xinjiang or even seen any pictures of Uygurs? The Uygur people are Muslim predominantly, that is without question, but they are Sunni Muslims and adhere to the Hanafi school of Islam that is renowned for its moderation and liberalism. It bears now relation whatsoever to the “brand” of Islam followed by the likes of the fundamentalist Taliban of Afghanistan fame or al Qaeda.  One only has to look at pictures of Uygur woman to see that fundamentalism is not an issue in Xinjiang. Generally they dress very much in a western style with make up and jewellery. Whilst a majority will wear a head scarf there are very few who wear a hijab that is a basic dress form of Islamic fundamentalism.  As well alcohol is used in moderation by some Uygur which is something that certainly would not be tolerated in a fundamentalist society. I do not believe anyone with even a little knowledge of the Uygur would call them “fundamentalists” or believe they are “spurred” on in anything they do by “ Islamic fundamentalism”  Then Dr Yi claims the Uygur have an ideological brotherhood with al Qaeda and share common goals. Again nothing could be further from the truth. The Uygur, unlike al Qaeda, are by and large, pro western and pro American. They look to the west to support them and many consider their so called “Muslim brothers’ in Central Asia and throughout the Arab states to have failed to offer them support. It is common sense, China is an economic lure for the central Asians and for the Arab world the “enemy of my enemy is my friend”.   So ”Separatism”, “Islamic fundamentalism” and associations with al Qaeda ”spur” blighted Uygur to “successive” attacks on the mighty Han regime to “destabilise” it? I do not know what Dr Yi understands the word ‘successive” to mean but for mine it is acts following one after another with the inference of a close time frame. Without going in to a detailed rebuttal of the Doctor’s statement I can not see the very limited number of violent actions perpetrated by the Uygur against the Han since 1949 or even since the 80’s as being “successive” What has been independently verified, as distinct to what the Chinese Government claim, could in nobody’s terms be called “successive’ with all the implications that choice of word entails. At best violence being perpetrated by Uygur on Han has been extremely sporadic since 1949, of little real consequence and hardly what one could call organised or “successive” to the degree one would expect from “professional” terrorists organisations.  Dr Yi also characterises this so called “Uygur terrorism” as having a well defined programme built on base networks at” home and abroad” and that they are able to elicit a positive response from the general population.  Anyone with the vaguest understanding of the Uygur will know that if they have one problem as a people in all their dealings with the Han Communists is that they are not able to rally and organise effectively. Many commentators have remarked that it is due to a lack of common purpose and shared “identity” that has hampered the Uygur in achieving any positive concessions from China.  I am sure that Dr Yi should know that the concept of “Uygur” as a ”nationality” is something that existed for a short period in the 8th and 9th centuries CE with the Uygur Orkhan empire, but, went out of vogue with the Uygurss move to present day Xinjiang from Mongolia. It was only resurrected as a concept by “Uygur’ intellectuals in the late 19th century. Even as late as the 1960’s you were a Kashgarlik before you were an Uygur.  This lack of identity and common purpose makes it impossible for the Uygur to become organised with a well “defined programme” of action let alone “terrorism”. Since the short lived East Turkestan Republic (that by the way only held sway over 25% of the Uygur population in it’s short history) the Uygur have been unable to throw up from their midst any person or group to take on the mantle of “Uygur” leadership.  There are no organised Uygur “terrorist” groups active in Xinjiang, at least not to the degree a casual reader would think from perusing the Doctor’s article. There is no “Pan Turkism” (it is a rather outmoded concept since the demise of the Ottoman Empire and the Soviet Union) There are no organised terrorist organisations outside Xinjiang either. There is, full stop, no such thing as an “Uygur terrorist organisation” as the world understands the concept.  I can not prove that something does not exist but someone writing as the doctor has written is bound to backup his assertions with at least a modicum of factual data and not rely seemingly on information gleaned from Chinese propaganda or the likes of the “People’s Daily” or “Xinhua” the news organs of the Chinese Communist Party.  Two things in closing, every commentator in the world, bar Dr Yi, agrees that the Han Chinese are now at least at parity with the Uygur in terms of population numbers if not significantly ahead. Not, as Dr Yi infers by his use of outdated data (2000 census figures are out) that the Han are a minority in Xinjiang.   Finally I do agree wholeheartedly with Dr Yi that the Chinese have done quite well out of the “War On Terror”

						   With the passage of time memories of cataclysmic events like Tiananmen Square 1989, Gulja 1997 and countless others of the 80's and 90's in China have begun to fade. Those in exile from China's oppression in countless countries around the world are now showing the effects of age and family responsibility. Too busy, many of them,  with the daily grind of life to "man the barricades" with the zeal and investment in time they once did. Less and less are the postings on internet "message Board", fewer and fewer are the internet websites and protests events and petitions and lobbying of politicians and governments.   The linked article talks about some of these people, those that have stuck firmly to their original principals and those that struggle in their new lands and long for a return home to family, friends and familiar ways.  The article quotes an Oakland, California , resident Lin Muchen, who is in his 50s, and was involved in may pro-democracy events in China and was jailed as a result as saying that he understands why many have left the movement.      "When you live abroad you have to make a living, pay rent and sometimes you don't have enough time to organize or go to meetings," he says. "You don't have the time to write articles and even if you do, what affect will it have on what's happening in China?"     With China's booming economy and promises of reform it is understandable that many of these exiles are turning their eyes longingly to where their roots are. It is even more understandable when you see that the world that stood so steadfastly behind them in those times in condemning the Chinese government is now, more often than not, seen in smiling pictures of shaking hands, slapping backs and signings of lucrative trade deals, best of buddies.  There you are in a "foreign" country, far away form your ancestral home, away from family and friends with parents aging and dying, unseen and apart.   You read the papers or hear the news of people just like you, your contemporaries, your generation, buying new imported cars and  lavish apartments and holidaying in exotic places whilst you work perhaps an unskilled job barely scraping by.   The Chinese Government can be forgiving when it suits it's purpose and at the moment it is attempting to lure trained and talented people who have left China to return to the "motherland" and partake of the feast. The 'prodigal sons" are being welcomed home so to speak.      "If you become inactive or passive about what you think of the Chinese government, they may take you off blacklists," says Xing Zheng, president of the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS).     Maybe not all are welcome just of yet, maybe some never, but if you have some talent and are willing, if not to recant your past, at least leave it in the past then you may well qualify.  Time is a great leveler and age a great "forgettor". As human beings these exiles have a right to be where they believe they belong. If that is back in China so be it. They have paid their dues, they have done their bit. They certainly should not be looked down upon or see themselves as traitors to the cause.

						       Thanks once again to Stephen Frost over at Asian Labour News for the following story about another mine death in China.   As Stephen points out the story is not only of importance because it records for all to see another death in China mining's never ending " death conveyor belt " but also for detailing the lengths mine owners and government officials will go to in attempts to cover up mining accidents, especially those that contain elements of illegal or unauthorised activity.  This culture of silence, cover up and corruption, combined with a seeming lack of accountability through the mining industry generally, are the reasons why China's mining death toll, reputed to be upwards of 10,000 per annum, is the highest in the world by all benchmarks.   This atrocious record  is not just the result of occasional work safety issues but constitutes the  most gross of China's violation of human rights. The Chinese Government knows when it opens it's doors to business each January 1 that during the course of that year it will oversee, by it's knowledge of the situation and it's failure to act,  the death and destruction of so many people just as if it directly ordered their destruction.   Every shareholder of any international company that profits from involvement in any way with China's mining industry (other then the providers of mine safety technology and know how) should immediately petition their respective boards to provide a please explain as to their  Corporate Ethics . Like wise all foreign Governments should review their positions and bring the necessary weight to bear onto the shoulders of the Chinese to effect immediate and widespread reform of this "criminal" industry.

						       " Chinese police have warned leading dissidents to stay at home during the visit of US Vice President Dick Cheney, apparently out of concerns that they will raise issues over China's dismal human rights record. "    As they do in National People's Congress Times Chinese authorities have increased surveillance on known dissidents in Beijing.   The Chinese have not the man power to police the mine industry that kills 10,000 people a year but have enough people to put on 24/7 watches of dissidents and 30,000 officials to monitor the internet.  I carried a story recently about  Bao Tang  the ex high ranking Communist government official who was jailed over Tiananmen. He claims that his surveillance team numbers 20.

How can a regime that practices it's own brand of  urlLink  apartheid   against the Uygur people get invited to such a shindig?

						       The Uygur ethnic minority of China are a turkic Muslim people and are by far the most distinct ethnic group in China in terms of appearance, language and culture.   Inhabiting Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in China's northwest, so named to recognise that once the Uygur were far and away the most dominant ethnic group in Xinjiang, the Uygur are devout if rather secular Muslims. Being Sunni Muslims and following the Hanafi school of Islam they are both moderate and liberal in their practice of Islam.  In the Muslim world today they are rather unique in as much as that generally, as a people, they have an extremely high regard for the "West" and the United States in particular. In my considerable research on the Uygur, my monitoring of their discussion forums and my conversations with them I have but on rare occasions ever seen or heard any Uygur denouncing the west or America. I might also add I have only on one occasion happened across anyone who has advocated violence as a means of achieving their dream of an Independent Uygur Republic of Eastern Turkistan.  The Uygur are represented abroad by a variety of organisations that attempt to publicise the plight of the Uygur to a wider world. One of the most respected Uygur diaspora organisations in the world is the  urlLink Uyghur American Association  headquartered in Washington D.C in the United States.   Like most of the Uygur diaspora associations the level of their activity waxes and wanes but generally has decreased in recent years as a result of many factors such as available funding, swings in world opinion etc. No matter how passionate one can be it is hard to every day maintain a high level of enthusiasm in face of general world disinterest in your cause. Banging your head against a brick wall can take it's toll.  The UAA has a " phorum ", a discussion board  where Uygurs in diaspora and their supporters, or those just interested, can post news and discuss issues. It, like the organisation that supports it, runs hot and cold, depending on the type of news occurring at the time, but there is a core of stalwarts who scour the world news looking for articles that in some way impact the Uygur at home. Occasionally such a news item will fire up a flourish of posts as people have their say. Occasionally someone will post  something that is a little controversial and that too will get the "boards" pounding for a while.  There is an interesting discussion going on at the moment that for someone not very aware of the Uygur or feel, like many, that being Muslim they are automatically anti the west and anti-America, may be worth while having a look at.  It started when a poster commenced a thread essentially criticising the United States and calling for the Uygur to rely only on Islam to further their cause.  If one believes the propaganda of the Chinese that the Uygur are " Islamic extremists " " Islamic fundamentalists " and " Islamic terrorists " who are a common enemy in the " War on terror " then the replies to this original post may change your opinion.  It is well worth taking a look at, I think you will see a passionate but peaceful and conservative people who, whilst being devout Muslims, do not fit the world stereotype of what a follower of Islam is especially a group that is so often called Islamic terrorists by the Chinese government. (If you are so inclined feel free to offer your opinion as they are most welcoming of any show of support or interest even if you diagree with them.)  Whilst mentioning the UAA they have announced that they have received some funding from the  National Endowment for Democracy  (NED) a bipartisan not-for-profit foundation that supports the advance of democracy abroad through grants to non-governmental organization worldwide.  This will allow the UAA to increase the level of advocacy for Uygur rights. Theyalso have just moved to 1700 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington ( a stone thow from the White House). Not a bad address for an organisation representing a people who  the Chinese call   "terrorists".

						        "Shanghai, China's largest city is set to implement a new population policy beginning Thursday that will make it a bit easier for certain locals to have a second child. "   urlLink China Daily :   Shanghai, the most densely populated city in China is to  pass legislation to ease restrictions on it's  urlLink China's One Child Policy  Chinese law stipulates that a couple may have only one child however there has been some exceptions to these rules.   Couples in areas designated as rural may have a second child if one of the parents is disabled to the point of  having his or her "labour capabilities" grossly impaired. There is also the unofficial "one and a half child policy" in rural areas as I reported in a post recently. Under this unofficial policy some rural areas are turning a blind eye to rural couples having a second child if the first is a girl.  Ethnic nationalities too are "exempted" from the one child policy but in certain areas such as Xinjiang there is considerable pressure on people to comply.  The proposed change in Shanghai will allow a husband and wife who both are single children themselves to have a second child.  The "one Child Policy" brought in to curb China's rapid population increase 25 years ago this year is having some unseen side effects.  Partly as a result of the policy China's population is rapidly aging which is  almost an unheard of scenario in a developing country's economy.  The policy has also major implications for the rural economy. The one child policy effectively robs farming families of a cheap labour source making marginal farmlands non viable. It is also a major discouragement for the young to enter the rural industry. Instances of sex engineering as a result is rife in rural areas as couples choose abort girl embryos as girls are seen to have less economic worth and unlikely to provide for parents in the their latter years.  Another consequence of the "One Child Policy" is that as parents engineer the sex of their children and provide less in ways of medical treatment for serious ill girl children the male/female ratio is getting seriously out of kilter to the point that it is estimated that by 2050 there will be 20 million surplus males in China. The social, health and crime ramifications of such an imbalance can only be guessed at.

						           "There have been no blasts or assassination incidents in northwestern China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region over recent years, according to a news conference held in Beijing on Monday.   " urlLink China daily :      "The violent terrorists in Xinjiang are like rats scurrying across a street, hated and detested by everybody,"     So says  urlLink Ismail Tiliwaldi Chairman of Xinjiang Uygur A.R  and an Uygur .  The China Daily went on to quote him as saying that the "growing" stability was as a result of the Chinese Government crackdowns on "separatist" activity and the growth of the economy.    Such a statement as this by Tiliwaldi, that there have been no "bomb blasts" or "assassinations", would make a casual observer believe that Xinjiang has been rife with such occurances and that only in the last year or two have they been brought under control as a result of Chinese diligence and improved economic circumstances.  Let's look at this Teliwardi's assertion in the light of known facts and put this allusion of his into some context.  In February 1997, the year Hong Kong was returned to the mainland, a demonstration by some 1,000 Uygurs in the small town of Yining (population c. 250,000) was met by a brutal response by the Chinese officials. Whilst official Chinese records indicate that 9 people died and 198 were injured as a result of the clashes, Uygur eyewitness and diaspora organisations claim that the immediate death toll was significantly higher, upwards of 400, the majority of whom were Uygur.  The Chinese response to the incident was swift and brutal. It is alleged that within days of the incident over 30,000 troops were sent to Xinjiang and many to Yining in particular. So great was the troop movement in fact that it has been stated that Chinese Foreign Affairs contacted Kazakhstan counterparts to allay any fears of a strike against that country!  It is claimed also that thousands of Uygurs were rounded up and detained, not only in Yining but in other areas of Xinjiang . One Uygur "eyewitness" claims 90% of all Uygur families in Yining had at least one member detained. Martial law was immediately implemented in the major cities of Xinjiang and communications to Xinjiang were cut. Official executions of some of those arrested began days after the "riots" were put down and it is estimated that as a result of the Yining incident 124 Uygurs were officially executed, many quickly after the event. Some witnesses claim the approximately 30 Uygurs were sumarily executed on the day and their deaths kept secret. The situation, as can be imagined, with the lack of information, the troop movements and "official" executions, let alone the claimed summary executions, would have been absolute chaos. Even today what really happened in Yining is unclear.  It is also claimed that the Chinese fearing greater unrest throughout Xinjiang should the true extent of what happened in Yining get out issued a decree in Yining called the " three no's ": " no questioning " " no telling " and " no visiting "  to hide the extent of what happened in Yining from the rest of Xinjiang and the world.  In late February 1997 there were two bomb blasts in Urumqi the capital of Xinjiang Killing 5 people and one later in Beijing that injured five people. The two in Urumqi can definitely be attributed to Uygurs, not so the one in Beijing in which the modus operandi was completly different to the Urumqi bombings.  In fact if one was a real conspiracy theorist one would say that the Beijing bombing was rather timely to say the least. In all incidences though Uygurs were tried and executed for the crimes.  That then is the extent of the "bomb blasts" in over 13 years in Xinjiang (Chinese claim an Uygur bomb attack in 1991) and, whilst not condoning violence, one would think that given the reports and rumours that were coming out of Yining of mass arrests and executions that these Urumqi bombings were as a result of exceptional provocation in a particular set of circumstances. Not as one would think as being part of a widespread and ongoing programme of bombings that the Xinjiang leader would have us think.  With regard to "assassinations" the only assassinations Tiliwaldi could be alluding to is the death of two  Uygur Muslim clerics who were killed in Xinjiang in the 1990's supposedly as a result of their pro-Chinese stance and alleged informant activities.  Three (two?) bombings and two murders in over 13 years does not, in my view, justify the comments of the Xinjiang leader that infer an extensive  history of bombings and assassinations plaguing Xinjiang until recently.   This statement is essentially scaremongering and an attempted re-enforcement of the notion of an " Uygur Terrorist threat " that China has been peddling, rather successfully I might add, to the world since "9/11", to justify their repressive policies against the Uygur in Xinjiang.  There is no reduction in terrorist and separatist violence as Tiliwaldi stated because quite simply there  has never been   any such thing. The bombings in Urumqi happened 7 years ago and were as a direct response to a particular set of very emotion charged circumstances and had never been part of any pattern prior to that time nor have they been repeated. Likewise the "assassinations" were one off events that have no precedents or similar events occuring afterwards.

						      I really liked the article I link to below. It was written by a journalist who according to his bio has spent several years reporting in China.  Essentially he puts forward an alternative  report card   for the liberalisation and democratisation of China. A report card with some different benchmarks than those normally used by the international community.  I like them firstly because they are a bit novel but secondly because they are very good indicators.  His first benchmark is the   Return of Talent . In this he argues quite rightly that the net result of the "talent" leaving and the "talent" returning is an excellent indicator as how the "intelligentsia" view what is going on in China and the way the trendlines point.  This group of Chinese, educated and savvy, are motivated by opportunity. Opportunity to make money, opportunity to learn and opportunity to express their freedoms. If, for example, the economy maintains it's rush, if freedoms of learning, interaction and expression are enhanced this group of people will return from abroad in significant numbers. If these factors worsen they will continue to leave China to find them as they have done so in the past.   I like this one particularly as this class of Chinese are not only educated and should be attuned to change  but generally have the ability to move very quickly unlike the millions of migrant workers, for example, whom are shackled generally by a lack of education and severe financial constraints. This more mobile intelligentsia therefore are a better "liquid test" as to how things are really going in China.  The government too, recognises this "benchmark" and has been very pro-active in programmes to entice the "wanderers" to return home.  His second and third benchmarks concern   Migrant Workers . This much maligned and exploited class of China numbering by some estimates 130-150 million are, in the words of the author,  the most widespread case of human rights violations in China.  Treated as aliens, devoid of state protection they are exploited mercilessly receiving in many instances less money than a Shanghai beggar makes. They work the hard manual jobs in high risk industries such as construction and mining where injury and death is part and parcel of their world. Recently I commented on the sad story of a migrant worker woman who gave birth to a stillborn child because two doctors attending her walked away when she couldn't afford the bill  Many of these "migrant workers" or "floating population" as they are alternatively known, go unpaid and just recently  urlLink Premier Wen Jiabao  was taken enough by the plight of one such worker that the issue of unpaid wages to migrant workers (and others) was pushed up the list on the political agenda. It is estimated that 94 million migrant workers are owed over 100 billion Yuan in back wages.   Thus migrant workers human rights, wages and condition are,  it is argued by the author, an excellent barometer of social change in China and bear close scrutiny.  I am a little lost on the authors fifth benchmark which relates to  Children of laid off workers .   In China there are many hundreds of thousands of workers who have been laid of by the  Chinese SEO's (State Economic Organisations) in recent years. Made redundant by the shut down of inefficient state run enterprises they received scant benefits and do not have a great opportunity for re-employment. This heretofore "elite"of the working class are none too happy with their new situations.  I think what the author is trying to say is that if the children of these workers can go well in education and life then the "laid off workers"  will be less  unhappy and will cause no great concern to the state. They could however become quite a destabilising force if their level of dissatisfaction as to the future for their children rises. How you track and quantify such a benchmark is beyond me but nonetheless the author has identified, in my view, a very important indicator  in China's "report card".   His sixth report card indicator is the " yuppies" or "dinks " call them as you will. This group of young  nouveau riche  Chinese are blissfully enjoying the full fruits of China's rush to a market economy.  Driving imported cars, living in new and expensive housing, this group the author argues, bears close watching as an excellent indicator of where China is going and more importantly how it is going.  Unless checked some how by the government this new middle class will demand greater and greater freedoms. How the government reacts to those demands will be an important index of political and social change in China.  The next of the seven indices is the ubiquitous Chinese " web surfer ". This ever growing group of Chinese are interested in information and gaming and have see the internet as a method of disseminating ideas and discussing social issues. The government's response to this group is important in assessing change in China.  Already this year we have seen several crackdowns on chatrooms and bloggers and China reportedly employs some 30,000 people to monitor and censor the web.   Some overseas websites are classed as "forbidden" and are blocked from being seen in China. The BBC, the Catholic church and even innocuous small time sites like my  urlLink Uygur website  (ranked 2,000,024 in the  world) are blocked from viewing in China. My site for example whilst blocked still gets "spidered" on a weekly basis from China (why they do this when the Chinese people can not see it is beyond me but I suppose it keeps someone in work)  Put simply, liberalisation and relaxation of censorship of the net is a good indicator of positive change, the reverse is bad.  Finally a very novel one.     Dogs  are not allowed by law to be on the streets of Beijing in daylight hours apparently and their owners have always been upset by this longstanding rule. The author says (and don't laugh this really is a great indicatorto watch) that how this issue goes so does the nation.    When these dog laws are repealed China will be finally free!!

						           HARBIN, April 10 (Xinhuanet) -- At least five coal miners were trapped underground early Saturday by a mine explosion in Jixi city of China's northernmost Heilongjiang province, local work safety officials said.       The blast occurred at Hada village of Jidong county at about 5:00 a.m. when an unknown number of miners were working underground, they said.       The owner of the mine has fled after the accident and the coal mine has no operation license from the state, according to the Heilongjiang provincial coal mine safety supervision authorities.       Rescue work is going on by press time and local government officials have rushed to the scene. The cause of the explosion is under investigation    Why do the Heilongjiang provincial coal mine safety supervision authorities now know that the mine was not licensed?. Surley  these unlicensed mines must be known to authorities  before people die !   It is nothing short of criminal negligence

						      Earlier this year a Dr. Jiang Yanyong sent a letter to the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party calling on them to reassess the CCP's culpability over the 1989  July 4,  urlLink Tiananmen Square Massacre   Dr Jiang is a well respected former Military Surgeon who came to prominence during the  SARS epidemic  in 2003 by coming out publicly and detailing just how serious the SARS problem was. In doing so he forced the government, that was in a state of in public denial, to come clean on the true extent of the epidemic.  At the time of the Tiananmen massacre Dr Jiang was a military surgeon serving in a hospital in Beijing that treated many of the casualties of the attack. His witnessing of the dead and wounded has apparently haunted him ever since.  His letter was widely applauded with the general consensus that here was an extremely brave man, one who dared so publicly, to call the present CCP leadership to task over  probably the most sensitive incident in Chinese Communist Party history. And so he is.  So great was the public response to the leaked letter that it has been claimed that Internet discussion rooms and blog servers were closed down or heavily censored to stifle debate on the issue. Also, that the treatment of known dissidents, who normally come out to protest at National People's Congress time, was far more severe than has been the case in recent years.  This is by way of background to the main theme of this post.  Today I happened upon a post at  China Digital News  entitled  " The 'Best' Period for Human Rights" ". It was an article/letter translated from the Chinese and submitted by someone other than the author. The article carried no introduction and no biographical notes as to the background of who wrote it.   For someone not right up with recent Chinese history they could be forgiven for thinking that it was written by an man who, for whatever reason, was caught up in the Tiananmen Massacre in some way and served a jail term as a result. Now, apparently old and obviously frustrated, he has been prompted to right a fairly reasoned missive, though one laced with cynicism and a degree of pathos, questioning why the present leadership's is attempting to claim that now, 2004,  is the best period for Human Rights in China’s history?  In the letter the author speaks of having his freedom of movement limited and having his phone and Internet disconnected during the recent National People’s Congress, nothing more or less than that which happened to a lot of known “dissidents” at the same time.   However like Dr Jiang whom I spoke of at the beginning of the post, this author also had written a previous letter of some consequence.    One of the Most Extraordinary Letters In Chinese Modern History   In March 1999 this very same  author had written another letter that at the time was hailed as " one of the most extraordinary letters in modern Chinese history ". (www.democracy.org.hk. March 27 1999)   Like Dr Jiang, the author in a letter to the Politburo of the CCP, called upon them to admit that the Party had made one of the most significant mistakes in it's history over the handling of Tiananmen and one that, no matter how long the passage of time, would haunt it and the people of China to the core.  The author wrote this letter to the Politburo and it's members not as a stranger but as one who personally knew each and every one of them and,who, in 1989, was the second highest Chinese government official to fall as a result of opposing the party's decision to forcibly break up the students in Tiananmen.    The author of these two letters is Bao Tong who in 1989 was an aid to  urlLink Zhao Ziyang   and prior to that  in the mid 80's was  the  Deputy Director of the Chinese State Commission for Economic Reform  for the CCP Central Committee. An original revolutionary and associate of Mao Zedong there was only one person higher than him to fall and that was his boss Zhao Ziyang.  As a result of his support of Zhao, Bao was arrested and was held for two years in jail before being formally charged and another five before his release in 1996. Following that he still was to endure a further 11 months under house arrest.  Since then he claims in his latest letter that he has been watched 24 hours a day by a rotating team of about 20 state security personnel who, to give him credit, he does not disparage for doing the job they were directed to.  He claims also that every year around the time of the annual National Peoples Congress his phone and Internet connection is cut off  only to be restored at the end of the Congress. This year however, and rather ominously, the connection has not been restored and it is this that, at first impressions, seems to have prompted him to pen this letter in frustration.  In the now famous March 1999 letter to the politburo he, like Dr Jiang,  called upon the then leaders to take the step of openly coming to terms with the CCP’s guilt over Tiananmen and admitting that the 1989 leadership had made a terrible mistake.   In the letter he likened the Tiananmen Square students to other young and impassioned men who were not without their mistakes in the 1940’s many of whom were sitting the Politburo in 1989.   He said also that at all times the students in Tiananmen were “ orderly, their demonstrations constituted neither riot or rebellion ” and inferred that they were no threat to national security as claimed after the massacre.  He spoke of how  Mao Zedong  had the courage to openly admit that the  Cultural Revolution  was the nadir of the CCP’s post 1949 history but that the admittance of the mistake was it's highest point. He stated that Tiananmen now had became the Party’s nadir, but, like Mao, the leadership of 1999 could make amends and raise the esteem of the CCP in the eyes of an unforgiving Chinese people by admiiting errors of judgement  History tells us that his plea to the Politburo went unheeded. Despite what has to be considered an incredibly heroic stance and one fraught with immense danger, Bao was not punished though he was warned that unless he kept his own counsel he would be charged with treason.  One can not help thinking that this current  letter ,  given it’s timing in the lead up to the 15th anniversary of the massacre, is something  a little more than just an old man venting his frustration over the loss of his phone and Internet connection.   May you live in Interesting Times...   There is a confluence of occurrences here that do not bode well for the Chinese Communist Party.   Firstly and obviously this is an important anniversary year being the 15th since 1989. Secondly we have the Dr Jiang letter that caused so much commotion and to a degree set an agenda. Then we have the  urlLink Tiananmen Mothers  obviously planning something that has the central government worried enough to have a couple of them arrested as a warning.   Now this article/letter, (which I might add at time of writing I have not seen any verification as to it’s authenticity) , from a former highly ranked party official, now old but still persecuted for his ideals and courage.  A man who has suffered so greatly for his beliefs.   Lastly, on top of all this, we have another  man who  many call the  "Hero of Tiananmen"  ,  Zhao  Ziyang, the penultimate casualty of the Student protest, old, frail and likely enough near death in this very important anniversary year.  If I were sitting in the Politburo now I might be thinking that perhaps someone has wished upon the CCP a variation of that wonderful old Chinese curse:    “May they live in interesting times.”        Must Read Articles    For the latest leter from  Bao go to  urlLink China Digital News    For further reading go to a copy of Bao’s  original  urlLink 1999 letter to the politburo       Recommended Reading    As well for a good analysis on the tenth anniversary of the massacre CNN had a special in 1999 that includes some interactive photos  urlLink Why June 4 will be taboo in China for a long time .

						     urlLink  www.phayul.com     The indefinite hunger strike of three members of the  Tibetan Youth Congress  has entered day seven with the three Tibetans facing pretty bleak weather in their encampment outside the U.N. Building in New York.  The three are calling on the United Nations to step up pressure on China over human rights violations with regard to Tibet. As yet despite personally delivering a letter to the United Nations they have not received any formal reply.  The hunger strike is attracting the attention of other Human Rights groups many of whom have visited the trio offering encouragement  and taking part in  symbolic fast as a show of solidarity and support.  The "strike" is timely with the current sitting of the  United Nations Human Rights Commission  in Geneva where the United States has tabled a resolution calling for condemnation of China's Human Rights record.  Regular medical checks confirm that, though hungry, the three Tibetans remain in good health.   Linked Article Read Rating : Only If You Have The Time

I am not really good at maths but does that mean there is going to be very little arable land within 50 years?

So far, five miners were killed in the accident with one still missing, said Sun Banglun, an official with the municipal administration of coal mine safety. "    I am not keeping track of the number of deaths in China's coal mines I am just posting information as it comes to hand to highlight the veritable slaughter that goes on there.  Mine safety has got to go to the top of  urlLink Premier Wen Jiabao  agenda with upwards of an estimated 10,000 deaths per year in substandard and totally unsafe mines that should be closed down. The Chinese Government is just not willing to  cut production from an overstretched industry that supplies 75% of China's energy needs so that the problem can be fixed.  It continues as a glaring example of the states lack of respect for the sanctity of individual human rights.

						     urlLink  Xinhuanet -  :     In an article published today in Xinhua (and totally unbeknownst to me at the time [see earlier post today] ) the official Chinese news agency asks the question "What's the weakest link in China's healthcare system?"   Finance? Infrastructure? Governmental attention? All of these are candidates Xinhua says but a leading government health official   urlLink Vice-Minister of Health Gao Qiang   says it is the lack of trained professionals especially in the rural areas  "Official statistics indicate the rural areas, with 70 per cent of the country's population, have less than 30 per cent of the medical resources. " Gao Qiag is reported to have said.  Having  a successful health care system is all of the above but mostly you must first have political will, infrastructure and a public health system that is non discriminatory.   Train as many health care workers as you like but unless you have a culture of caring, infrastructure and a universal health care safety net you will not be able to provide an adequate national health system that is capable of attracting  workers, especially to the rural areas.

						    urlLink The New York Times      The New York Times reports that in a surprise move  urlLink Premier Wen Jiabao   has unexpectedly suspended plans for a massive dam system on the  urlLink Nu River   in western China   His personal involvement is a rare and surprising response that has shocked observers for Chinese leaders are not renown for  there concern about the environmental effect of major public works projects.  Environmentalists consider the Nu, which rises in Tibet and flows 1,750 miles through Yunnan Province between the Mekong and Yangtze, one of the last pristine rivers in Asia. Its upper reaches flow through a canyon region so rich in biodiversity that a United Nations agency last year declared it a  World Heritage Site .  In a written instruction Mr. Wen ordered officials to conduct a major review of the hydropower project, which calls for a 13-stage dam and has been widely criticised by environmentalists, scientists and even by the governments own  State Environmental Protection Agency .   China's government has historically had an atrocious record on the environment. Pollution levels for water and air are among the worst in the world. Recently, though, Mr. Wen who has developed a name as a populist leader has spoken about the need to emphasize environmental protection. A geologist by trade Wen apparently is very knowledgeable on rural issues having spent several years of his early life working in the countryside.  Moves such as this would seem to indicate that the new leadership is continuing to break further away from the CCP "old guard"

						         " Doctors in China caused the stillbirth of a baby and left its mother in critical condition Sunday because she could not afford to pay for emergency care. "    China's Medical system does not have a "safety net" like so many others. If you are wealthy you are ok if you are in the employ of the Government you are ok if you are a migrant worker in China with only $37 to pay a major medical bill your life is not worth it.  This story is about a migrant worker in China whose child was delivered still born and who almost lost her own life because two doctors and an ambulance that arrived to her emergency delivery turned around and went home when she did not have the money to pay the bill.  Human Rights is not only about political dissidents being denied natural justice or being incarcerated for life., or bloggers being shutdown. It is not only about religious persecution or whether you have the right to vote.  The most basic of Human Rights is the right to life. Those who deny life are the most base of Human Rights violators.  When China is spoken of lately it is in the glowing terms of her great advances in human rights reforms. "China is guaranteeing private ownership of property" " China is guaranteeing Human rights in the Constitution". "China is executing  less  people." "the government is recognising the rights of beggars not to be arrested and deported to their home provinces"  These things are good and China is to be applauded, but when the rest of the world says we are not going to support the Americans with their Resolution at Geneva because China is getting better then they are making one hell of a mistake.  Are there degrees of human rights violations? If I rob you for $10 instead of $20 am I any less a criminal.   Do we have a "benchmark" and say ok those guys have reached it so let's forget criticising them and in doing that stop encouraging them to greater heights?  A child is denied the basic human right, the right to life because his mother is an impoverished migrant worker that the system does not recognise as human enough to get free medical treatment in such a grave emergency.  This is not an isolated case, people die in China daily not only from a "bullet in the back of the head" or "pneumonia" in a work prison, or falling down the steps of a police station or by being trampled by a bulldozer pleading for their homes.  They die also because this wonderful economic powerhouse, this miracle of industrialization does not value the sanctity of life enough to invest the money to guarantee even the most basic of medical rights to the poor and impoverished.  They say of their treatment of the Uygur, the Tibetans and of religious groups that the welfare of the few should not endanger the welfare of the many. They say they have to act like this because they face "unique problems" as a developing nation and as one so populous that we in the west can not comprehend.   There is some mitigation there of course but does it not say something about the "corporate culture" of a nation when two  doctors  at the scene of an emergency can turn around, walk away and let a child die because the family had no money and the system allows it.  "Don't criticise us" the Chinese say "Look what we are doing, look how great we are" "Why does the United States involve themselves in our internal affairs?" "Why do you propose this resolution?"  Why, because one of the reasons is your culture allows innocent children to die and this is a the ultimate reflection of your how civilised you are.  But perhaps you would call that child a "separatist" because he certainly is no longer a part of your great nation.    urlLink  (United Press International) :

The draft resolution presented on Thursday to the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva has no co-sponsors though there is a belief that some nations friendly with the U.S. will vote for it.  Famous Chinese exiled dissident  urlLink Harry Wu   has called the lack of co-sponsors as being "weak"  Whilst there was never a hope that the resolution would be passed as China has successfully defeated all previous resolutions of it's type, the lack of co-sponsors and support generally is a blow to anyone interested in Human Rights and provides China with a  significant "win".  There is no doubt that China is making progress in Human Rights but progress coming off such a low base does not mean she is anywhere near up to scratch. The failure of the international community to maintain the "encouragement" of China towards Human Rights reform essentially allows China to take the foot off the pedal.   I think it was Mao who had the theory that you advance when there is no opposition and retreat when there is.  I have been running a poll here at the  China Letter  as to whether people think Resolutions of this kind work. All votes bar one so far say yes they do to varying degrees, the dissenting vote feeling they are  counterproductive and make matters worse.  Whilst I do not support " China Bashing " I think that the Chinese respect firmness and consistency and this weak kneed approach by the international community driven no doubt by an economic agenda will not speed up the rate of change in China.

						     urlLink IHT: Philip Bowring: Blaming Al Qaeda for everything :      "From Uzbekistan to Mindanao, from southern Thailand to Chechnya, from Iraq to Xinjiang, government responses to local insurgencies are creating a climate whose chief beneficiary is Al Qaeda."    Could not have said it better. This quick article says nothing new but we have to keep reminding ourselves that al Qaeda is not this all pervasive, all strong, octupus of an organisation that threatens the world.  So much pain and suffering and even death has been visited upon innocent people all over the world in the name of the "War on Terror". The Uyghurs of Xinjiang are a case very much in point.  The world's bumbling rush to take the "war" to al Qaeda provided the Chinese government the excuse to further repress the Uyghur for no other reason than they were Muslim and it allowed the Chinese to mask their true objectives from the international community.  The rooting out of terror wherever it may be is an important objective of free nations but in doing that let us not lose our objectivity , let us not go tilting at every windmill thinking that it is al Qaeda. let us not let our politicians manipulate us with the "War on terror" for their own political objectives.

'The three unearthed ancient musical instruments are well preserved and intact,' said Zhang Yuzhong, deputy director of the local archaeological institute.       'The three musical instruments may be even older than the two Konghous excavated in Zhaluguke tombs dating back 3,000 years to the sixth century in Qiemo County of Xinjiang in the 1990s.

"    The Uygur people of Xinjiang are famed for their musicianship and plucked instruments are very prominent in their culture and have been for countlless centuries.  It will be intersting to see what the origins of these are as Uygur history can only be reliably traced back to 300 BCE when the Uygurs ancestors the  Dingling  were first mentioned in Chinese and Persian histories. Prior to that it is thought that the tribes that were to become known as the Uygur lived a nomadic lifestlye in southern Siberia and Mongolia.

						    urlLink Harvard     I recently had the pleasure to attend a lecture at Sydney University by  Professor Colin Mackerras   of Griffith University Brisbane, concerning the current situation in Xinjiang. I reported on this in a previous post in the  China Letter . The above link takes you to the published paper which formed the basis of that lecture.  Without rehashing that post I commend you to a reading of this paper put together after a field trip Professor Mackerras undertook in Xinjiang in late 2003.  Professor Mackerras is a world renowned China expert but has an affinity with Xinjiang and has visited there quite often in the last decade or so.  His conclusions essentially are that the lot of the Uygur has improved over the last ten years as evidenced by his personal observations and a variety of indicators but, obviously, serious problems still exist.  The professor's viewpoint is less than palatable to some Uygur in diaspora and I have have had quite "warm" discussions in Uygur bulletin and newsboards over my original post of the professor's assessment.  There is unfortunately a number of these Uygurs who perhaps do not want to consider that things may be improving even slightly for the Uygur at home and that the desire for independence does not burn as brightly within Xinjiang as it once did and still  obviously does with them. That is to be expected and is understandable as many of these people left Xinjiang at the height of Han oppression and brutality and suffered personally.  There is nonetheless serious problems still existing in Xinjiang for the Uygur as their exists a similar situation for the Tibetans. When something improves from a very low base it still may not be anywhere considerd acceptable despite the positive movement.   Professor Mackerras' assessment is based on cool headed analysis despite a certain "love" for the people and the area. Definately a must read for anyone interested in the Uygur and general Han Chinese ethnic policy.   urlLink  Professor Mackerras' website.  for a list of other publications on China and the Uygur.

						        In a thought provoking article entitled  urlLink Where is China Heading?: Analysis of the coming Leviathan   Dr Moonis Ahmar , a visiting fellow, Asia Research Centre, London School of Economic and Political Science, argues that there exists today six “fault lines” in the Chinese system that pose potential threats to the stability and future direction of the country and ergo the future of the Chinese Communist party.  Despite the expansive title however the doctor fails to answer his own question adequately enough  but certainly provides some thought starters as to the dilemmas the Chinese Communist party must be facing as it manages the country’s transition from a Marxist state to a market economy.  To expand on his analogy, Dr Ahmar believes in essence that Chinese society today is akin to a city straddling several seismic fault lines, each capable of slipping and setting off an earthquake that could rock or even destroy the city.  These ‘fault lines’ he identifies in the article as being   Ethnic divisions  Economic inequality  Unemployment  The floating population  Corruption, and  Taiwan    Ethnic Fault Lines: Uygurs and Tibetans   In his ethnic divisions “fault line” assessment the article identifies the situation in Tibet and Xinjiang as being ones that could have a major impact on Chinese society.  What I find amazing is the constant referral of academics and commentators to the “threat” posed by ethnic division in Xinjiang and  urlLink   Tibet . It sometimes appears to me that they believe that at any moment the  urlLink Uygurs  and the Tibetans will pounce upon their Han oppressors, slit there throats and then what?  March on Beijing?  The Uygur number about 9 million and the Tibetans 5.5 million, they have no army, they are considerably out gunned and just a little outnumbered.   Some of these commentators point to Chechnya and to Afghanistan as being examples of the trouble a small number of highly motivated people can cause a large nation but these were two completely different scenarios.  The Soviets were in their death throes when these two situations caused them their heartache, her military was demoralised and badly equipped, there was not a lot of political will. Contrast that to China, a completely different story, a country on the rise with more than enough military muscle and political will to handle anything the Tibetans or Uygurs could throw at them even if the latter were inclined to do so.  Yes, the Uygurs and the Tibetans in their hearts wish and dream of independence but neither are a stupid people, nor have they shown any desire, as peoples, to achieve their dreams through violent means. The Chinese through their continuing policies of cultural oppression and harsh “crackdowns” have all but successfully destroyed the “will” of these blighted peoples.   No, in my view ethnic divisions can not be considered one of the major threats to the structure of Chinese society as the Doctor argues.     Economic Fault Lines: Unemployment et al   The Doctor speaks of two economic “faultlines” and one with both economic and social considerations, that is: economic inequality, unemployment and the floating population. He rightly identifies that these are real threats to any society not only that of China, but, as he points out, so long as the economic miracle continues these pose no immediate problems. As long as the affected peoples have reasonably full bellies and are treated to sops once in a while, as the government is adroitly doing, then these do not pose immediate threats.    Corruption and Taiwan   He then moves on to corruption which as we all know China appears to excel at being ranked as one of, if not, the most corrupt nation on earth. He believes that whilst the government has the rhetoric on fighting corruption it is short on fulfilment.   I think that this is probably a harsh assessment. The problem of corruption is so endemic and so historically entwined in Chinese culture that no one would be able to eradicate it overnight, if ever. Having said that I feel the government is beginning to make headway and is certainly doing enough to ward off the effects the doctor envisages such as a declining work ethic with all it’s negative connotations. As I said corruption or at least it’s more ‘acceptable”  form of giving and expecting “fringe benefits” is something that goes very much with the territory in China.  Finally he speaks of Taiwan which it must be admitted by all to be the San Andreas of Chinese fault lines and needs no further discussion here.  With regard to the future of the Chinese Communist Party I agree with the assessment that at present given the booming economy and the historical importance of the party to China that the Chinese people do not seek, at the moment at least, an alternative. The Pro-democracy elements are small and not organised and the Chinese people in all their history have known no other way than autarky and are not generally uncomfortable with it.     Religion: Oof Seismic Importance?   Whilst the Doctor makes no mention of religion I assume he does, by omission, not deem it a potential “faultline”. I too do not believe that religion per se will be a problem for social stability albeit that the continued rise of Christianity will be a problem as to the longevity of the CCP.  Some analysts point to the Islamic factor but that is just not real. Whilst China has many Muslims they are no way unified nor likely to “rise” so to speak as one under any Islamic banner. A major fault I believe in many commentators analysis, and one I might add is the result of improper research, is in seeing the Uygur as being driven by any form of religious fundamentalism or extremism. Even if that were to be true they could not get support from the likes the Hui Muslims or even their “Turkic brothers” the Kazak/Chinese.    China's Shifting Sands   Crystal balling China is no easy task there are just too many variables. Problems like pollution and general degradation of the environment are never identified as potential “faultlines but who is to say that they may not become considerable factors in social stability. Many human rights issues may be dark horses as well.  As the Doctor quotes  urlLink  Deng Xiaping   as saying “    the Chinese people are like a plate of sand  ” and I for one would not like to be doing the balancing act.

						    urlLink BBC NEWS        "'In most of the countryside in China we have what we call one-and-a-half-child policy. That means if a young couple's first child is a male, they must stop child-bearing. If the child is a female they may have a second child,' he said. "    I have carried this story before about the demographic time bomb ticking away in China. According to projections there will be 20 million excess males in China by 2020 resulting in what will be the largest gender imbalance ever experienced in a sizeable nation.   This unheard of state of affairs can be directly traced to the " One Child policy "  the Chinese introduced 25 years ago this year to curb population growth in the world's most populous country.  The result of this policy is that with modern sex determining techniques and birth control methods (read abortion) the Chinese people, particularly the poor rural people, are manipulating births to ensure that they have a boy child.  As the linked article infers as well, infant mortality among girl children is higher than among boys as families are prepared to invest less resources in keeping alive gravely ill girl children.  The reason for this is that  in rural areas boy children are seen as both a source of cheap farm labour and as "superannuation policies" for parents in  this social security challenged land.  What this will mean once the imbalance becomes significant no-one can precisely predict other than to sound general warnings of a potential dramatic rises in mental health problems and crime, particularly rape and child sex abuse.  I led this post with  a quotation from the article by a  population expert from  People's University in Beijing  Zhai Zhenwu which I found particularly intersting. Zhai  claims there is an " unofficial child policy " in rural areas where if the first child is a girl than the authorities will look the other way if the couple were to have a second child.  The article does not mention it but the "one child policy" must be contributing to the current rural crisis of falling output and migration from the rural areas to cities.  Children, as a form of cheap rural labour, probably made the difference between much marginal farm holdings being economically viable or not. As this source of cheap labor dries up people are abandoning their holdings or productivity decreases through the inability of landholders to afford "market rate" labour.

						     urlLink Constitution helps man fight for home :       "At 63, Huang Zhenyun says the newly-passed amendment to the Constitution is the key to keeping his house from being torn down -- at least for a while. "    In the lead up to the March  National Peoples Conference  (NPC) there was much debate as to how " real " the planned amendments to the Chinese Constitution were. The two amendments concerned private ownership of property and a "Human Rights"  Some argued that they were not worth the paper they were written on, some suggested that the judiciary would fail to give full force to the law. Some " experts " wanted every i dotted and t crossed before they would consider it of being  any use. Some people pointed to the constitutional guarantees that already existed, such as the guarantee as to freedom of religion, and used that as an example as to why amendments were nothing more than window dressing.  My argument at the time, through posts in the  China Letter  , was that these two amendments were of immense historical  importance and would, over time, act as catalysts in bringing sweeping changes to China.  Yes, I agreed with all the commentators as to the  enforceability  or  actionability  of the laws and yes I agreed with them when they said that guarantees of religious freedom already in the Constitution had not been effective.  But I argued that the importance in these two amendments was not in their "actionability", the ability to obtain redress, the  importance lay in the " expectations'  that they would raise in the Chinese people.   I argued that it was not the actual exercising of a freedom that was important, we in the west have many constitutional freedoms we do not exercise to the full extent, but that "freedom" comes from believing  that we could if we wanted to. It is a mindset thing. If you start thinking you have a freedom, no matter how unrealistic in reality it is, your whole mindset and outlook changes. You start to "expect" things to be a certain way, you expect things and people to behave in a certain way.  It is like a canary in a cage with the door open, it may never fly out but I bet it feels a hell of a lot happier thinking it can if it wanted to.  It is these expectations that will be the driving force behind a "new China" and the linked article is a perfect example of these "expectations" in action.  64 year old Mr Huang Zhenyun and his wife are  battling the local authorities and land developers over the amount of compensation for the forced reclamation of their house and land, property that has been in the family for two generations.  It is unlikely that he will win or receive the compensation that he wishes. It is unlikely that he will be able to challenge any outcome with his battle with the authorities in any Supreme Court action under the Constitution, but here he is with his wife proudly relying on the constitution and it's "guarantees".  In what would have been a powerful and moving image Huang said he held up a copy of the document as he stood at the gate of his house as bulldozers arrived. The bulldozers went away.  The bulldozers will be back, Mr Huang will receive less than his claim but just think about it, think about what the " expectation " of a freedom has done in this instance. Think of the ramifications, the small seismic wavelets that go out from a small protest like this, think of the image of this man and his wife clutching a piece of paper with the red and gold seal of the People's Republic on it's cover to ward off a bulldozer, a piece of paper that they believe "guarantees" them a "freedom".   Think then, if you will, of 1.3 billion people clutching a piece of paper that they think "guarantees" them a freedom, then tell me these amendments were not worth the paper they were written on.

With Zhao ill and of advanced age, recent calls on the Politburo to re-assess the Communists Party's culpability over the tragedy causing much interest and the 15th anniversary of Tiananman coming up in June, the death of Zhao might just be a catalyst for further pro-democracy activity.

						    urlLink Article (washingtonpost.com)      I am very wary of taking all news articles at face value. Some stand out like the proverbial and you automatically think that perhaps you had better do some extra research. Stories involving money tend to fall into this category. But others, reported by internationally recognised newspapers like the Washington Post, you normally tend to take them as written  One expects of this latter class of news organisation objectivity, a certain degree of source verification , general background checking  and even, at the least, a quick glance at " Google ".   In other words one expects professionalism. After all, as readers, we can not go off and research every article we read can we? We expect, and rightly so, that these "respected " papers already have done that, that is after all why we read them.    The Background   On March 23   Reporters Without Frontiers ran a story titled    urlLink  Plot against former bosses of newspaper Nanfang Dushi Bao   condemning the jailing of two newspaper men and the arrest of another from a newspaper in Guangzhou city in Guangdong  Province. The article stated reasonably emphatically that this was a beat up and meant to warn not only the journalists on the paper in question but the nation’s press generally from overstepping the mark. In other words "tow the line or we will come down on you just like this".  When I use the word emphatic I mean real “man the ramparts” type article.  The article reported that the arrests were as a result of these noble journalists pushing the ideal of  "freedom of the press" to the nth degree and in doing so upsetting the Chinese Communist party.   In particular the report identified two stories these supposed intrepid journalists had run that had brought the Chinese officials down on them like a ton of bricks.  One was about SARS and the other, a reasonably noted one, about a Chinese student beaten to death in a police lock up in 2003.  On face value anyone reading the article would say " those bloody Chinese are at it again, trampling on the freedom of the press, jailing outspoken journalists, typical" and think nothing more of it.   For me there was one aspect of the report that did not feel right and I commented as much in  urlLink  my post   on it the day after it was released.   The so-called "journalists" were charged with embezzlement and corruption, specifically, that they took monies from the company and paid themselves and others "Bonuses". The article stated that the two that have faced court and have been sentenced admitted they took money but argued mitigation as the practice of "bonuses" was a common one in the industry. The existence of this practice was reportedly verified by "Reporters without Frontiers" through several sources.   My post on this article said effectively that where there are supposedly noble ideals but also money involved go the money every time. In other words I smelt an odour that perhaps was not eau de cologne.  On April 4, the much respected  Washington Post   ran a rather lengthy story, with pictures no less, claiming also that the arrests were beat ups and that these were fine, "brave" upstanding journalists championing freedom of the press who were being cut down by a wicked regime. Again a very spirited article.  The Post’s article reports friends and colleagues of the three as saying that they:     have interpreted the prosecution of Cheng, Yu and Li as part of a determined effort by officials in the Guangdong provincial government or the Guangzhou city government to rein in the Southern Metropolis News and its in-your-face reporting.     Like Reporters without Frontiers, the Post has cited two incidents that were believed to have caused the arrests and quoted a Chinese "crusading journalist" as saying     ...local authorities were particularly irritated by a Southern Metropolis News report in late December (2003 Ed.) that revealed the discovery in Guangzhou of another case of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. The SARS case, which the provincial government had not announced despite pledges of openness in Beijing, was the first since the epidemic subsided last July.   In addition, Wang (the crusading journalist Ed.) and others recalled, municipal authorities already had been embarrassed by a revelation in the Southern Metropolitan News in March 2003 that an out-of-town student, Sun Zhigang, was beaten to death while in police custody     So there we have it. Two papers, one highly respected and one oft cited reporting a story  of three crusading journalists, brave enough to say what others would not, arrested, (and in two cases, sentenced )  by authorities who wanted to silence them and also send a strong message to any others foolish enough to attempt to follow their “heroic” example.    Some Information Not Given...    Now this is what a .15 second search on Google for the search term” guangzhou daily” reveals (Google's search time statistic displayed on each search result page)   The  Guangzhou Daily Group   is a large and apparently aggressive Communist Party owned newspaper chain with diversified interests. It runs 16 mastheads and with revenue from advertising of $US 188m controls 10% of the national print advertising revenue in China.   According to a Business Week Online article  urlLink  China's venerable newspaper faces stiff new competition   dated 30/12/02, in October 2002 a general manager of the group's property management division was convicted for taking bribes over some facilities construction. This followed the detention and release of two employees in early 2002 on a "broader enquiry on corruption"   So wide was this "broader enquiry" that the Hong Kong based  Swires Group  put in limbo a  urlLink  4 billion Yuan development project   that the Guangzhou Daily group had committed to provide significant capital to. This project was only reported back on track in the last week when the Swires Group decided to go it alone in the development.   Those " two employees " mentioned coincidently are the two who have recently been sentenced.  So we have a situation were a large business was embroiled in some major corruption scandal in 2002 one year before the advent of SARS and the death of the Chinese student. As well, two employees who were under suspicion then, now feature in the Washington Post and Reporters San Frontiers articles as being victimised for their outspokenness in 2003. This reported “victimisation” is despite the fact that not only were they previously under suspicion but also, according to the Reporters Without Frontiers article, had admitted in court that the facts of the state brought case were correct.   One would have to think that the Guangzhou Daily organisation was riddled with corruption in 2002 if not before for no-one backs out of a 4 Billion yuan project because one or two lowly people took some backhanders.   In the case of the recently arrested journalist one must  presume innocence until proven otherwise but one would have to think,  given the background, that the Chinese Government must have a least a reasonably strong prima facie case against him.  As such respected news journals perhaps should not get up on a high horse so quickly claiming persecution, intimidation, false detention and imprisonment as they have done in these two articles.  We look to journalists for objective and factual reporting so that the average person can form opinions. Examples of "professional" journalism that we are talking about here can only be viewed as blind “China Bashing”. It is wrong from two perspectives firstly, it wrongly gives a false impression and secondly can only diminish the positive effect of reporting on real issues.   It is no more honest or on any higher moral ground than the propaganda that we blame the Chinese so often for. As in this case of the Chinese’fight against corruption we damn them if they do and damn them if they don’t.      Linked Articles Read Rating:  A Must

						     urlLink Pacific News Service       -Whilst not pretending to be a Central Asian expert the recent  events in Uzbekistan do have ramifications for China and the  urlLink  Uygur   of  urlLink  Xinjiang as well.    Uzbekistan and Implications For China    In my post a couple of days ago which was carried by the  urlLink  Asia Times On Line   (my thanks to them for giving a "blogger" a go). I looked at possible reactions from the Chinese to the events in Uzbekstan.  The Uygur/Uzbekistan link arises from claims made by China shortly after "9/11" that there existed " Uygur Terrorist " organisations with links to  al Qaeda  and more importantly, as it concerns the current events, the  urlLink  Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan  (IMU) whose name has been thrown into the ring as one of the likely suspects in the Uzbek bombings.  My assessment in that article was that, for a variety of reasons, the Uzbek events should have no real effects on China's immediate policies on the Uygur and as the dust settles this so far has been true.  But by going through that exercise I have come to the conclusion that the events in Uzbekistan are not terrorist linked.     Criteria For Terrorism    One of the very basic criteria for terrorism is that it's acts are meant to instill fear to the degree that it can be called "terror" in a wide section of a community and by community I mean civilian, not military, not government infrastructure and certainly not the police..  As well it always used as an "advertisment" for the objectives of the terrorist or terrorist organisation. In other words they want the world to know who did it and why they did it.  These two basic criteria for terrorism are very often forgotten whenever a bomb is let off in any part of the world. All too easily we immediately think terrorist and in doing so automatically look for the hand of al Qaeda.  And I am beginning to think some of our political leaders want us to do exactly that.  But if we look at the events in Uzbekistan neither of these criterion is met. There is no widespread terror among the population and there has been no "claiming" of responsibility.     Police The Target?     The targets appear to have been the police not the public. Whislt 47 died only 13 of the dead were people not associated with the bombers and these were mainly police officers. There is of course an air of uneasiness in Uzbekistan cities but it is  by all reports far short of terror. In fact some reports have people actually "happy" that the considerably corrupt police have suffered quite heavily.  Then there is the lack of "claiming". No one has put their hand up and said it was us and this is why we did it. In Uzbekistan with the highly unpopular and repressive regime run by Karimov one would think there are plenty of reasons for such demonstrations against the state and plenty of people only too pleased to claim responsibilty.  But no-one has stepped up to the plate. No-one has taken advantage of the immense international publicity the events have generated to espouse their cause. What is the use of bombings if no one knows why it was done or what it is for?  That is not "terrorism"  But perhaps in this case the message that traditional terrorism attempts to get across to a wider target market has been received loud and clear but by a very particular target market. Maybe because we have been trained to  instantly make a " Pavlov dog "  progression from bomb blast to "terrorism" then to al qaeda that we can not see the wood for the trees.    Possible Drug Angle?    Uzbekistan is the hub of the Central Asian drug trade. A staging point and conduit for many gangs and organised criminal organisations, to run drugs into China Asia Russia and Europe.  They may have been trying to get a message across about their cause , not to the general public and the world , but to a select group namely  law enforcement in Uzbekistan.  The message would be clear to the target market and therefore no need to publicise  to a larger world as a terrorist would need to, thus the lack of "claiming" as we have seen here.  This is not the work of al Qaeda they are far too quickly brought up in any situation like this and that tends to be more than providential for certain governments looking to use the " War on Terror " for their own political ends.  It is more than likely not the work of the IMU who, by many reports, have either been neutered or have chosen not to follow violence as a path to obtain their aims. It is probably no other Islamic extremist group either.  Most likely it is "gangland" and drug related but once again the terrorism angle best suits the political agendas of many people, parties and governments and that is the one that will be publicised regardless.

						      Presenting credentials to the Australian government recently was the newly appointed Ambassador from China  Ms Fu Ying  a 51 year old career diplomat originally from Inner Mongolia and coming via various postings in Romania,Indonesia, Cambodia and the Philippines.  In a Sydney Morning Herald article Fu is quoted as preaching the now  de rigueur  Chinese diplomatic line of " Peaceful rise "    "There is a fear about the future orientation of Chinese foreign policy. It's not surprising, because in world history many big powers rose and caused earthquakes. But I think China is going to be different, because the world has changed. It's not like in the past when powers had to expand territorially in order to get markets ..."   Then the veiled, if not threat then at least subtle warning:   "I think China is reliable, but will Australia convince the Chinese Government that it is reliable?" asks Fu. "When you (Australia)had this kind of relationship with Japan you were from the same side of the fence. No ideological barriers whatsoever. With China it is different. Do you understand China that well? And does China understand Australia that well?"  "Ideological barriers"? Is this a euphemism for differing perceptions of Human Rights? Is she saying "hey here is the carrot but get out of line here also is the stick"? The carrot being your place at the "trough", the stick being the reverse.  What other "ideological barriers' can she be alluding too? Surely not democracy versus communism? I think the world has gotten over that particular barrier as it concerns China.  No. What she is saying is do not meddle in our internal affairs concerning human rights,the Uygurs, Tibet Taiwan, Falun Gong, et al and we will get a long just fine and you will benefit from your association as a result of your acquiescence.  It is a cockiness that I have mentioned before in China Letter posts. A growing arrogance deriving from China's maturing economic importance in the global economy.   urlLink Premier Wen Jiabao  exhibited the same "cockiness" in speeches and news conferences on his recent trip to Europe including  his talks with the European  Union.  The Sydney Morning Herald writer, Paul Sheehan, seems to think that a new ambassador provides an opportunity for Australia to:   "do with less America and more China in its international relations, if the right details can be negotiated.  In his words he sees a real "prize" in substantially abandoning our historical relations with the United States   "If Fu accurately represents the will of Beijing, then there is a real prize to be gained here, a genuine strategic alliance with the country reshaping world trade and thus world diplomacy. How ironic, and satisfying, it would be if Australia, having always aligned itself with great white powers as insurance against the Asian peril, can, and should, end up with powerful alliances with both Japan and the giant we have feared for a hundred years." How ironic and how satisfying what? That we end up in an "alliance" with a country with the despicable human rights record of China whilst forsaking our alliances with our traditional allies. Alliances that have  been tested in fire. Allies that despite momentarily lapses have proven over many years to be paragons of freedom liberty and democracy as compared to China.  What would motivate us to do this Mr Sheehan? Twelve pieces of silver?    Do not be too quick Mr Sheehan to jump naked into the rose petal covered bed that appears so inviting. Part of what Ambassador Fu said that you find so alluring was "It's not like in the past when powers had to expand territorially in order to get markets" when asking us to trust China's peaceful rise and she is correct, things in that respect have changed with globalisation. But what has not been proven to have changed is what countries do when the are starved of resources. Getting "markets" is but one part of the economic process, another is production and production requires resources and China is quickly running out of these.  It is a little too early talking as Mr Sheehan has, perhaps another 50 years in which time China can prove her bona fides a little more than she has done to date especially as it concerns human rights.  To Madam Ambassador welcome and I hope your stay here is a hell of a lot of hard work because if it is not then it will have meant that we, as a nation, have abandoned all our princoples and have sold out for "12 pieces of silver".

						      In 2003 the United States Of America mined 1.07 million tons of coal. In 2003 China mined 1.7 million tons of coal.  In 2003 53 people died in coal mine accidents in the United States. In 2003 between 7,200 and 10,000 died in coal mine accidents in China.  A quote from U.S Coal mine safety expert H.L. Boling at a recent Joint Mine Safety and Health Conference in Salt Lake City Utah, United States:   "Every accident is preventable." And telling someone to hurry at their job "is like going out and telling a person to have an accident."  A sign at entrance to the mine shaft at Ximing Mine, a major state-owned mine on the outskirts of Shanxi's capital Taiyuan   "Come up short today, must make it up tomorrow,"   Differing attitudes differing safety results.  Of course direct general comparisons in coal mining safety are not accurate. Different mining operations have different risks, open cut mining for example is less dangerous than underground mining but despite this nothing can ameliorate China's record in the comparative results of these two major mining countries.  America has not always been so successful in it's mine safety but we have to go back to 1907 when last the United States equaled China's daily official coal mine death rate of 20 a day.  But China now, as distinct to the U.S. of 1907, has the benefit of almost 100 years of technology improvements to call upon, if it wished. Almost one hundred years of the combined experience of the coal mining industry from all around the world to look to for answers to her atrocious record, if she wished.  No, there can be no excuses, no extenuating circumstances for this tragic loss of life ,only the pitch black fact that in China human life runs a very poor second to the economy.

						   According to a new definition of terrorism coined recently by Chinese Deputy Director of Public Security Ma Mingyue terrorism, Uygur terrorism in particular, is where terrorists exert a "bad influence" on people.  According to Wajahat Ali of the Daily Times of Pakistan on Friday Ma Mingyue, when addressing a group of Pakistani   journalists on a visit to Urumqi , capital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China, told them that members of the internationally listed Uygur "terrorist" group  ETIM  had holed up in the Pakistani cities of Lahore and Rawalpindi.  When pressed about how these dangerous terrorists from China's most wanted group  operated in or from Pakistan  Mr Mingyue is reported to have said that they were    "simply being a 'bad influence' on people visiting Pakistan from Xinjiang".    Simply being a "bad influence"  If it was not so damn serious it would be laughable.  China has claimed since "9/11" that the  East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM)  was an extremely dangerous terrorist and Islamic fundamentalist organisation that had "proven" links with both al Qaeda and the Taliban. That it was an extensive network of members resolute in their aim of separating Xinjiang from China and setting up an independent Uygur Islamic state.  So insistent was China as to the threat this group posed to Chinese and world security it petitioned the United Nations to proscribe this then little known group as an "International terrorist Organisation". By way of payback or whatever for China's support of it's "War on Terror" the United States backed China's push and ETIM was listed early 2002.  As I said, at that time nothing was known of this "dangerous international group". Uygur diaspora organisations stated that they had little or no knowledge of it or it's supposed leader Hassan Mahsun. The United States State Department when announcing the listing could offer no proof of their misdeeds other than stating the Chinese had told them the details, no collaboration validation, nothing. A State Department spokesman even admitted that the group is not known to have operated outside of China or targeted Americans or any foreign national. But of course they could do so that is why they were described as an international group.  In December 2003 the Chinese government trotted out it's "Most Wanted List" of Uygur terrorists and poor Hassan Mahsun topped the list as the equivalent of  Bin Ladin  in the Chinese terrorism stakes.  The problem was however that Hassan had been dead a full two months at the time, killed by soldiers in a raid on some flea bitten village in Pakistan thought to be a terrorist camp. On top of that China had helped in the identification of his remains. So either he was not really that important to be remembered or China had intended to "keep him alive" to perpetuate the myth, until of course some Pakistani let the cat out of the bag so to speak.  Now a leading Chinese official comes out and says this. Caught,as it would appear, ill prepared with "facts".  It really is about time that the world disabuses itself of the belief in "Uygur Terrorism" propagated by the Chinese to lend validation to their oppressive regime over the Uygurs of Xinjiang.   Anyway on a lighter note (for you readers at least)I am off to hand myself in to the local cop shop because well, in honesty, I have been known to have been a bad influence on a lot of people, especially on a Friday night after work.

						    A rather interesting article on the "Uygur question", in as much as it looks at it from the angle of Pakistan's role in the repression of the Uygur people of Xinjiang, China, is  Dr Bhaskar Dasgputa's  "  China A Friend In Need? ". It leads in with a concise history of the Uygurs before getting into full stride analysing Pakistan's sycophantic relationship with China and the ramifications for the Uygur.  Dr Dasgupta, currently working on a doctorate at Kings College in International Relations and Terrorism, claims, and rightly so, that as China has attempted to do with the Turkic states of central Asia (Kazakhstan Uzbekistan et al), it has  placed pressure on Pakistan to support it in it's oppression of the Uygurs. He states that Pakistan's response to the diplomatic pressure exerted was typical:   "As usual, Pakistan showed its spine and fine martial spirit, just like it showed to the USA, and caved in. The police and intelligence agencies moved in, Uighurs in Pakistan were targeted, killed, deported, imprisoned or what have you. Many were directly sent back to China (guess what happened to them) like Ismail Kadir for example. Others were reported to have been handed over to the Americans who then sent them over to that tropical Caribbean paradise of Guantanamo Bay."  As was pointed out in a previous post "An Uygur's Letter to America" many of the Uygurs hunted out of Pakistan were political refugees from China's repression of the Uygurs in Xinjiang. Without passports they had nowhere to go other than to Afghanistan and into the "welcoming arms" of the Taliban. That of course is not to say that there were no Uygurs voluntarily in Afghanistan working actively for separation from China. Like the many nationalities represented in Afghanistan there are some Uygurs who prefer violence as a means to an end but from everything I can gather their numbers were and are few.  The writer ends this very different styled piece by referring to Pakistan's double standards over the Uygurs as a result of it's economic reliance on China"     Self determination and fighting for freedom principles are great, but Xinjiang becomes an inconvenient issue. The cause of Palestine is heard all over the world, but Xinjiang is so inconvenient that the mere mention of it causes embarrassment and shuffling of the feet. After all Alfred Adler said : "It is easier to fight for one's principles than to live up to them.    The author's history is a tad off though.     "In 1945, the first serious threat to Chinese sovereignty was due to the announcement of the Eastern Turkistan Republic, claiming sovereignty over Xinjiang with a firm Islamic flavour."   There had been far more serious threats to Chinese sovereignty in the 19th century.  Yakub Beg  and his  Kashgaria  was far more worrisome for the Chinese. In 1945 sovereignty over the majority of Xinjiang was vested in the Nationalists and some "warlords" who were on their last legs anyway.  And, yes, whilst the republic, which held sway for a short time over only 25% of Xinjiang (centered in the  Illi  region north west of Urumqi), was based on Islamic principles it was forthright in stating that all religions were to be allowed to be freely practicsed. This is no different than say American or English democracy being based on Christian principles.   "In 1949, most of the leaders of the republic died mysteriously. Funnily enough, the Chinese communist government then took over Xinjiang."  Here he refers to a number of Uygur leaders from the Eastern Turkistan Republic being killed in a plane crash whilst on a flight to Beijing to discuss post takeover issues. Whilst it was "mysterious", highly coincidental and ultimately fortuitous for the Han, the republic had already decided to accept Chinese sovereignty in exchange for Xinjiang becoming an autonomous state within Communist China. As for the rest of Xinjiang (the other 75%), that was already a "fait accompli" with the Nationalists in tatters.   Much emphasis is placed by people on the Eastern Turkistan Republic, none less than the Uygurs, and whilst it controlled an army that would have caused the Communists some not unreasonable trouble in the short term, in the long term the writing was on the wall.  Thus Xinjiang "capitulated" without a shot being fired.  All in all though an intersting article and worth the read.

						     The UK Statesman carries a story originally from the Times of London citing the Chinese  State Council  as saying that  Gedhun Choekyi Nyima , the Dalai Lama chosen 11th Panchen Lama is alive and well despite speculation that the 16 year old kidnapped by Chinese officials in 1995 was dead.  The Panchen Lama is the second most important position in the Tibetan religious hierarchy second only to the  urlLink  Dalai Lama .   Shortly after Gedhun Choekyi Nyima was named by the Dalai Lama in 1995 as the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama Chinese officials raided his home in Tibet kidnapping him and his family. Two weeks after his disappearance the government announced their own Panchen Lama supposedly "correctly" chosen according to Tibetan Buddhist law.  Chinese officials denied any role in his disappearance at first but in 1996 admitted that they had the Panchen Lama in their "care" protecting him and his family against "separatists" kidnappers. Since then nothing official has been heard of the boy though rumours as to his death have cropped up from time to time.  According to the Times report the State Council statement confirms that the boy is alive and well    "His health condition is good and he is living a normal and happy life and receiving a good education,"    The Chinese chosen "Panchen Lama"  Gyaincain Norbu  recently  urlLink appeared in Shanxi province  where he was reported as praising the Chinese state for its religious tolerance and urged Tibetans to support the "motherland".  Despite the State Council's statement that Gedhun Choekyi Nyima is "free" it is highly unlikely he will ever live anything but a life of virtual imprisonment as long as the Communist regime rules in China.  As a "living god" he poses just too much of a threat to Chinese rule over Tibet.   Link: Additional Information  Read Rating:      urlLink The Statesman

						      The following is the text of a letter sent by an Uygur man to US Secretary of State Colin Powell. It needs no analysis or comment suffice to say that in knowing the Uygur as I do the sentiments expressed are true and widely held.This  "Uygur Letter"  was printed today on the Uygur english language message board  urlLink Uighur-L.  a member entry board. Turdi (whose surname is witheld for security reasons) is well known for his advocacy of the Uygur situation.  There are many who believe that everyone incarcerated in Guantanamo is a terrorist this obviously is not the case considering the large number slotted for release. Many, undoubtably like some of the Uygurs, were impressed into the service of the taliban or were of no difference to any foot soldiers of any nation in the world that sends it's people to war.     The Honorable Colin Powell, Secretary of StateDepartment of State2201 C Street, NW, Washington DC 20520  Dear Secretary of State:  I am deeply concerned about the fate of the Uighurs in US military custody in Guantánamo Bay. According to the Amnesty International, they are at risk of forcible return to China or to third countries where they might face return to China. People who are familiar with the Uyghur situation in China will not doubt for a second that those men detained in Guantanamo will be tortured and executed should they be returned to China.  They were captured in the context of the armed conflict in Afghanistan and transferred to US custody around January 2002. An Associate Press report published on Nov 25, 2003 quoted a senior US defense official as saying,   "Washington is quietly discussing with China the terms under which an undisclosed number of Chinese Muslim separatists would be released from Guantanamo and returned to China. The Uighurs at Guantanamo Bay were captured in Afghanistan, but the United States has no further interest in holding them because they are not believed to pose a threat to U.S. interests. Their main aim is to return to Xinjiang and fight for independence — a goal they apparently sought to further by training in Afghanistan."  On 13 May 2004, a US State Department spokesman said that the USA has "identified some who might be eligible for release… We have talked to the Chinese and other governments about this situation." There is absolutely no reason to believe that China will honor its promise and will not mistreat these Uyghurs. Once those Uyghurs set their feet in China, they will become "the internal affair of China." It is well documented that the Chinese government has systematically tortured and executed suspected Uyghur separatists. China has executed a number of Uyghurs in recent years including asylum seekers and refugees repatriated from neighboring countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan and Nepal in total disregard to the strong protests of the international community and human rights organizations. Those people were originally political dissidents or religious students who went to Pakistan to escape Chinese persecution.   After Pakistan forcefully returned some Uyghur dissidents to China where they were executed, the rest of the Uyghurs in Pakistan escaped to third countries. Some who did not have passport and other proper documents ended up in Afghanistan since it was the only country willing to accept them. That misfortune led them to a combat that they apparently had no desire to take part in as it as clear from the RFA interview of Hasan Mehsum,( see Ed Note ) the leader of the Uyghurs in Afghanistan.   There is no evidence that they committed any terrorist activities or other crimes in China or anywhere else. On the Nov 26, 2001, the Chinese Government announced the details of all the alleged violence happened in the previous 10 years in connection to the Uyghur independence movement. There is no evidence or reason to link any of those (sic) violence to those men in Guantanamo.  In fact, the reason why the Chinese authorities want them back is not just to punish them opposing their rule but also to intimidate the whole Uyghur population. If they succeed to bring them back to China, they will be able reinforce that they can carry out their oppressive policy against the Uyghurs as they please and the Uyghurs have to accept it without complaining no matter how unfair it is since they can do nothing about it and even United States, whom the Uyghurs look up to for support, can do nothing about it.  It is no secret that China has long been carrying out a repressive policy against the Uyghurs, who, having been inspired by the US intervention in Kosovo and Bosnia, look to US for moral support. China has been quite annoyed by that. They have been using every opportunity to tarnish the image of US in eyes of Uyghurs and to smash the hopes of Uyghurs. Rebiya Kadir, a prominent Uyghur businesswoman, was harshly punished and sentenced for 8 years on the suspicion that she planned to complain about the Chinese treatment of Uyghurs to a visiting US official. If she really had sensitive documents to send to US or anywhere else, there were numerous ways to do that and she certainly had the means. But the truth behind her harsh punishment is Chinese authorities wanted to exploit the US connection of her case to sent out an intimidating message to Uyghur population by punishing her in disregard to the opposition of US government. For the same reason, the efforts of the international community and US authorities to get her released has yielded no significant result. The issue of the Uyghur detainees in Guantanamo is highly publicized among the Uyghurs. I hope US government will not give China another opportunity to intimidate the Uyghurs by reinforcing their message that not only the Uyghurs could do nothing about the way they treat them the whole world could do nothing about it and that even the only remaining super power yields to China's demands.  If those Uighurmen have committed any crime against the US interests, the US government has a right to punish them in any way they see fit, but sending them back to China should not be one of them. Because, it would not serve just as a punishment for these men alone, it would serve as a punishment for all the Uyghurs who believe in the moral integrity and justice system of the US government and the international community. This issue is extremely important for Uyghurs because what is at stake is not just the fate of those men but the dignity and self-image of the entire Uyghur people. Their feelings would be greatly hurt if those men are turned over to China for its cruel disposal.   Uyghurs probably are the most pro-US Muslims in the world. China is trying hard to use the Iraq war to damage US's image among Uyghurs. If the US returns those men to China, China may succeed. As a concerned Uyghur, I strongly urge the US government not to return them to China.  Sincerely,  Turdi (surname witheld)      Note:  Hasan Mehsum  was identified by the Chinese Government as the terrorist leader of the then little known  East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM)  and was top of China's "Most wanted list". ETIM at the pushing of China and with the support of America was named as an international terrorist organisation in 2002 in the wake of "9/11" despite there being absolutely no evidence other than China's say so as to it's crimes.  Mehsum in a radio interview with  Radio Free Asia  (RFA) in early 2002 denied catagorically that he or any members of ETIM had ever conducted terrorist activities in China or anywhere else. Mehsum was killed by Pakistan security forces in October 2003 having fled Afghanistan where he had originally escaped to from China.   Despite his death and China being involved at the time in the official identification of his body a government press release in December 2003 requested forign countries to support them in capturing him. A large gaffe which totally contradicted Mehsun's supposed terrorist leader status and the danger he posed to China or the world.

						    Chinese Tibetan delegation in US.      An  AFP  article carried in the Tibetan news reporting website  Phayul  claims that China has " launched an information  blitz " in the United States aimed to counter western perceptions of the situation in Tibet as concerns human-rights violations.  Leading this so called "blitz" is a delegation of "scholars and religious leaders" from Lhasa, capital of Tibet, who are on a week long tour of the United States and taking in visits to Washington, New York and Los Angeles.  The group will reportedly be meeting US legislators, students and staff of several US universities before returning to China this Sunday.   A spokesman from the Chinese embassy in Washington   Sun Weide   said the group, led by a University Tibetan Scholar, was in America to dispel    "lots of misunderstandings"     He went on to say that   "One example is that many people in the West, particularly in the United States, consider Tibet to be an independent country when the fact of the matter is that Tibet has been incorporated in Chinese territory since the middle of the 13th century,"  Well I do not know whether a delegation of six on a one week trip and only taking in three cities could constitute a "blitz"  but when combined with a series of press releases over the last several weeks trumpeting China's positive influence in Tibet, culminating in China releasing one of it's celebrated " White Papers " on the subject of  Tibet autonomy, one could say at least it represents a very concerted propaganda exercise.                             Lama told he can come home if he 'abandons his separatist propositions'                               -Tibetan Delegation Leader-              The Chinese government does nothing without reason. Usually such an effort would be as a result of adverse world opinion over a contentious issue or meant as a "sales pitch" for some particular reason.  Recently the  urlLink  Dalai Lama  has been doing some serious jetsetting and receiving whilst not tumultuous greetings wherever he goes the turnouts to his meetings have been quite sizeable and up on previous visits. His recent April trip to Canada has been described in true pop star terms as a "sellout". His meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Martin was seen as somewhat of a  diplomatic coup especially in light of some pretty heavy lobbying and threats from the Chinese side.  He then did a quick skip to France before turning up at the inauguration of the Taiwanese president last Thursday and now he is in Britain and meeting the likes of the British Foreign Secretary and Prince Charles. Once again all despite some very heavily lobbying by China to have him virtually treated as " persona non gratis " wherever he goes.  China also took the expected flack over Tibet at the recent  United Nations Human Rights Commission  meetings in Geneva and a group of Tibetan hunger strikers in New York in April were able to get some fairly high level UN response to their "demands".  China tends to run a scoresheet on such things and when the deficit gets a little high they come out punching. Other than what is happening in Taiwan and the forthcoming 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre (June 4) I can personally see no other reasons for this latest "blitz".  As I have said before the amount of animosity held by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) against the Dalai Lama is incomprehensible. They are doing more for the Lama's positive international standing and popularity then he is achieving himself but sometimes deep seated animosity can blind reason.

						    China cleans up job-related human rights violations.   If anything can be said about the Chinese government it is that they know how to make all the right noises. The problem however most of the time it seems is in turning words into action.  One particular "noise" they have been making of late is the drive to make government and party officials more accountable for their acts or omissions.  It has been apparent for a long time that Chinese officialdom runs on the premise of all rights and no responsibility. In other words they enjoy wielding power but if something goes wrong than it is always the other person's or other department's responsibility. Buck passing is a time honored profession and one well honed among Chinese bureaucracy.  Of late however it appears that words are actually being translated into actions. The last several months have witnessed a drive by the central government to inject responsibility and accountability into China's government agencies and officials.  Firstly, the government would appear, publicly at least, to be  attempting to create a culture of personal responsibility where officials guilty of oversight or dereliction of duty choose to take the honorable way out and "falling on their swords" by resigning. Unlike before when if anyone were to fall it would be some poor underling now, like western convention, the number one person is expected to resign for failings within his organisation.  Secondly, the government has increasingly announced new measures of government oversight and has shown a willingness to bring miscreants to task. Most recently, for example, it has announced the setting up of a "database" of personal details of judges, tracking such things as investments, incomes even marital status. The idea is that by doing so those judges guilty of corruption, career aggrandisement or even  with a susceptibility to "sexual seduction" can easily be found or at least be aware that they are being scrutinised.   As a result of these type of actions several high profile people have been charged in the criminal system for either corruption or dereliction of duty including ex provincial governors.  Recently China was stunned by the " Baby powder " scandal in which thirteen infants in Anhui died of nutritional deficiencies from consuming substandard milk powder and 171 infants suffered from malnutrition after being fed with milk powder deficient in protein and other nutrients as a result of contaminated bay powder formula.  The linked article at  China Daily  reports that two officials involved in the scandal have been caught in the government net:   "Two officials involved in the notorious fake milk powder case in Fuyang City, east China's Anhui Province, were recently put into custody for dereliction of duty, marking a resolute step in the country's one-year fight against human rights violation crimes by government officials."    On Wednesday  Wang Zhenchuan , deputy procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP), announced  that procuratorates at all levels will launch a sweeping one-year investigation into job-related crimes of infringing on human rights.   China Daily further reports:   '"Negligence of duty which causes great losses of people's lives and assets is one of the campaign's major targets," Wang said, adding the goal of the campaign is to fulfill the commitment of " respect and protection of human rights" enshrined in the Constitution and to defend basic benefits of the masses.'   Any moves towards providing greater transparency of government processes and decision making, proper management and oversight and inculcation of the ethic of professional responsibilty can only be of huge benefit to the human rights situation in China.  Whilst it is too early to asses how successful this campaign will be in the long term initial indications are quite positive that words, in this instance at least, can be translated into actions.

						      This "War on Terror", this blind tilting at windmills has to stop.    We, Australia and others, have spent trillions of dollars, diverted some of our best human capital and destroyed the lives of thousands in prosecution of a "war" that, take away Afghanistan and Iraq , saw less than 500 deaths as a result of "terrorist" caused incidents in 2003. I placed "terrorist" in inverted commas because even our definitions as to what is a terrorist act has become so blurred of late.                             This "War on Terror", this blind tilting at windmills has to stop                               -Stephen Sullivan-              To put it in perspective more Chinese miners die in a month. More Chinese pedestrians die in a week. Many, many more people starve to death or die form curable diseases.  Now each life is sacred and no-one can put a price on saving one but we can't keep investing to the level we have invested on the off chance that someone, somewhere somehow,  may die   when we know full well that Chinese miners, for example  will die   20 a day, that people in certain parts of the world  will die today, tomorrow and every single day of the year .   If we the free world"had invested those trillions, if we had employed these wonderful brains and human capital to these issues rather than diverting them to the "War on terror" the sum of good achieved would far outweigh the sum of bad and the world today would have been infinitely much better than it is. The lives of so many innocents who have been branded by their religion or place of residence would not have been so adversly impacted upon or even destroyed.  We all were rightly angered, hurt and worried after "9/11" that is understandable but now we have allowed our political leaders to manipulate the "war on terror" for their own agendas. They have inculcated a generation with blind hatred against a certain class of people regardless of their guilt. We are seeing the product of that in Iraq now. And it is not just in Iraq, it is in the mainstreets of towns and cities throughout the western "Christian" world.  Our "War on terror" has also bred a generation of people that will carry  hatred of us  to their deathbeds, people who otherwise would have not given us a second thought, innocent people caught up in our blind scrambling. We, the supposed "good guys" have rent a huge chasm in the world's society, we have split it along racial and religious lines and we have done so far more effectively than some billionaire madman could ever have done it.

						        According to   Xiao Yang , president of the Supreme People's Court (SPC)  when announcing a new initiative to inject fairness into the court system, sex and corruption, among other things, have influenced some Chinese court decisions:       "..a small number of cases were handled wrongly due to reasons ranging from bad judgments, taking bribes, sexual seduction or power infatuation,"    Xiao announced that China's courts will adopt a series of measures to supervise judges or officials by establishing a data bank on them. The linked Xinhua article states that the database:   ".... Includes 11 items like the official's or judge's housing, their spouse's or children's professions as well as the business operations they are involved in, their income and even tip-offs from the masses as a way to offer an authentic source for the discipline inspection branch to keep an eye on them."  The database may have to be quite substantial though. The artcle quotes Xiao as saying that in 2003  the court system in China handled over 8 million cases.

						        "China and Tajikistan have officially opened their shared border at a pass high in the  urlLink Pamir Mountains . State officials from Xinjiang province (sic) in western China and the Prime Minister of Tajikistan, Aqil Aqilov, cut a red ribbon at the mountain village of Kulma, sending a fleet of ceremonial trucks across to the Chinese side."     I ran a poll on a related website some six months ago asking who my visitors believed would become the  pre-eminent influence in Central Asia: Russia, China, America or India.  My own answer was that I thought it would ultimately be Russia with India being a dark horse. I based this on Russia's long history and in depth understanding of the region. My visitors were pretty evenly divided but overall America was seen to be the "winner" with China a close second.  Well some six months later I am beginning to re-think my position and am coming to believe that China will become the power in Central Asia.  This small piece of news is just another example of how by small and large steps China is slowly and inexorably insinuating itself into Central Asia. Recent news has also seen for example announcements of even closer relations between Khazakhstan and China economically and in security matters.   The importance of Central Asia to China is considerable not only from a strategic point of view but also as a source of oil and gas which is  much needed in an energy starved economy.  The border between Tajikstan and Xinjiang  has according to the linked article been closed for almost a century during the Soviet time. It is just one of many communication links that are opening up everywhere between China and Central Asia. The news abounds daily with reports of new bus route here, airline route there, planned highways and possible train routes in and through Central Asia.  For the Tajiks, like the Afghans a persian race distinct from the Turkic peoples of Xinjiang,Kazakhstan,Krygystan and Uzbekistan, the road provides quicker and cheaper access to Chinese consumer goods and machinery and technology needed to modernise their country. For the Chinese it further opens up another market and provides them with the added ability to trade onwards to other parts of Central Asia.   For the trivia buffs the Kulma Pass set among the towering peaks of the Pamir mountain range is one of the highest trading routes on earth with the border between Xinjiang and Tajikstan being over 4,000 metres high.

						     A man of rare courage and loyalty     With the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square student tragedy looming two men in particular are sure to return in their memories to those fateful days when they were forced to mount the ‘ Tiananmen Tiger’ . A “tiger” from which neither they or the Chinese Communist party has ever been able to get off.  One of course is  Zhao Ziyang  who at the time of the Tiananmen demonstrations was the Communist Party General Secretary. With succeeding years the legend of Zhao has grown. That of the leader who apparently dared to care and as a result fell from a lofty position, at the very pinnacle of communist party rule, to a life of virtual imprisonment and disgrace.  Zhao’s story is well known and no doubt will be recounted many times over the coming weeks, however another “ casualty ” of Tiananmen is less well known. A man whose loyalty for his leader, and paradoxically love of his party, led to his downfall as well.   This man the second highest ranking CCP member to fall as a result of Tiananmen  ended up serving seven years in jail and upon his release has swapped one prison for another. Unlike Zhao who has remained under close quarters, in what many term “house arrest”, this other man is “free” now to move about.  But so great is this man’s importance and so fearful is the Politburo of him that he is kept under constant 24 hour surveillance by teams of up to six state security personnel. No doubt his telephone, when not “mysteriously” disconnected at politically sensitive times, is tapped, so undoubtably would be his Internet access that he so enjoys until that too ‘mysteriously‘ goes offline only to just as “mysteriously” be reconnected.     Bao Tong  is a man of incredible honesty, incredible loyalty and has proven over the time during and since Tiananmen to be a man of equally incredible courage.  Bao Tong was, in 1989, the senior aide to Zhao Ziyang and prior to that in the mid 80's was the  Deputy Director of the Chinese State Commission for Economic Reform  for the CCP Central Committee. An original revolutionary and “familiare” of Mao Zedong there was only one person higher than him to fall as a result of those tumultuous days and that was the man he so loyally served Zhao Ziyang himself.  As a result of his support of Zhao’s anti force stance, Bao was arrested and was held for two years in jail before being formally charged on supposedly unrelated charges and for which he served another five years before his release in 1996. Following his incarceration he was to endure a further 11 months under house arrest.   Not that Bao was a pro-democracy reformer or particularly pro-student. In fact he comes across even now as being, if anything, very pro party.  But he was against the use of the military to break up the student demonstrators and in holding this view he placed himself at loggerheads with many of the “hardliners” of the CCP . It was this failure, or political error as he said openly himself, in not siding with the hardliners that cost him so much  In papers purporting to be a copy of his personal report after the incident to an investigative body of the CCP  he describes how he felt at the time of learning of the Politburo’s decision to send in the Tanks:   “…in my heart, I believed we had made a terribly wrong move; I was afraid that we would be trapped in a very difficult situation, ’ riding a tiger, very hard to get off””   Again in that report despite having to be aware of the fate that was to befall him and Zhao he is reported to have said:           As a result of his stance and his loyalty Bao fell and fell heavily. A lesser man would have thanked God that he eventually was freed and would have happily settled into a life below the radar  but not Bao.       One of the Most Extraordinary Letters In Chinese Modern History   Earlier this year a  Dr. Jiang Yanyong  sent a letter to the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party calling on them to reassess the CCP's culpability over the 1989 July 4, Tiananmen Square massacre.   Dr Jiang is a well respected, former Military Surgeon, who came to prominence during the SARS epidemic in 2003 by coming out publicly and detailing just how serious the SARS problem was. In doing so he forced the government, that was in a state of in public denial at the time, to come clean on the true extent of the problem facing the country and it’s people.  His letter was widely applauded with the general consensus that here was an extremely brave man indeed, one who dared, so publicly, to call the present CCP leadership to task over  probably the most sensitive incident in Chinese Communist Party history. And so he was.  But in March 1999  Bao Tong , only three years out of jail for his role in Tiananmen and a man obviously of tenuous circumstance, also authored a letter to the Politburo that was been described at the time as " one of the most extraordinary letters in modern Chinese history ". (www.democracy.org.hk. March 27 1999)   Like Dr Jiang was to do five years later Bao took the unprecedented step, for one in his precarious position, to send his own letter to the Politburo. In it he called on the CCP to admit that the Party had made one of the most significant mistakes in it's history over it’s handling of Tiananmen and one, no matter the passage of time, would haunt it and the people of China unless it received appropriate closure. That closure could only come with the CCP  openly admitting culpability over the outcome of the decision to use force, the death and destruction it was to cause and the resultant rent it has caused in the fabric of Chinese society.   In the letter, alluding obviously to many sitting on the Politburo in 1989, he likened the Tiananmen Square students to other young and impassioned men from the 1940’s who also were not without their own mistakes   He said also that at all times the students in Tiananmen were    “orderly, their demonstrations constituted neither riot or rebellion”   and inferred that they were no threat to national security as claimed after the massacre.  He spoke of how Ma Zedong had the courage to openly admit that the Cultural Revolution was the nadir of the CCP’s post 1949 history but that the very admittance of the mistake was it’s highest point. He stated that Tiananmen had now become the current Party’s nadir, but, like Mao, the leadership of 1999 could make amends and raise the esteem of the CCP in the eyes of an otherwise unforgiving Chinese people by admitting errors of judgement  History tells us that his plea to the Politburo went unheeded. Despite what has to be considered an incredibly heroic stance and one fraught with immense danger, Bao was not punished though he was warned that unless he kept his own counsel he would be charged with treason.  But true to the man that he is he has not to this day heeded the warnings. In March this year he was prompted to write a fairly reasoned missive, though one laced with cynicism and a degree of pathos, questioning the present leadership’s statements that now, 2004, is the best period for Human Rights in China’s history . .In this letter he speaks of having his own freedom of movement limited and having his phone and Internet disconnected during the National People’s Congress. He even talks, as an aside ,of trying to contact Dr Jiang to offer his support and congratulations over his own stance.  In another instance in a  radio interview conducted  by the “Voice of Hope” radio programme “Voice of San Francisco Bay Area” also reported in March  this year Bao openly talks about  one of the most touchy subjects for the CCP, the Falun Dong. And says:   “I think there is insufficient evidence to label an organisation with tens of millions of members a “cult” I consider these millions of practitioners exemplary Chinese citizens.”   He even goes on to blame in part the Chinese Government’s poor health care system in forcing people into alternative medicine and “well being” practices such as Falun Dong.  As recent as this month the Washington Post carried a report on Bao   Mr. Bao, a de facto spokesman for liberals among China's political elite, said that since Mr. Zhao stepped down amid the 1989 crackdown, 'many things stopped progressing. On the contrary, some things have even gone backwards.' He cited the party's putting itself back in charge of 'judging and making arrests in political cases' and its beginning to interfere again in the media and publishing sectors -- areas in which the party had minimalized its involvement under Mr. Zhao.    I do not know whether we can hold Bao Tong up as a democracy reformer I think that his unrequited loyalty to his party (as distinct from some of it's members) would rule that out. But one wonders what China would be like today if people like Zhao and Bao could have held sway within the upper echelons of the CCP back then. Would the outcome have eventually been different? What would China be like now? An interesting intellectual exercise that.  Regardless of his politics one has to admire the man for his incredible courage and loyalty to what he believes in and the fact that he chose, like Zhao, to prefer other avenues of resolution than that of violence. A violence so pervasive in Chinese Communist Party history and culture.  As an aside I wonder what Wen Jiabao, now Premier of China, thinks of this man considering they both served Zhao at the time in question but who managed to remain unsullied by the association with both.

						     Allegations of Chinese Officials Mistreating Guantanamo Uygurs     According to a Washington Post report  Amnesty International   has claimed that Chinese officials were allowed access to interrogate Uygur detainees in Guantanamo Bay Cuba.   Amnesty spokesperson Alistair Hodgett  is reported to have said that the human rights group's claim was based on several unidentified but "credible" sources however he declined to reveal them. Amnesty further claim that the Chinese officials took part in  unspecified mistreatment of the Uygurs during the interview/interrogation process. The U.S military declined to comment when approached by the Post though it is common knowledge that foreign officials have been allowed access to their nationals in Guantanamo.  The Uygur are a Muslim Turkic people residing primarily in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in China's northwest. China has claimed repeatedly since "9/11" that hundreds of Uygurs were trained by the Taliban in Afghanistan and Uygur "terrorist" organisations have strong links with both the Taliban and  al Qaida . They have however been unable to provide any tangible proof to support these allegations. Many Uygurs have been imprisoned and executed as a result of dissent against Chinese rule and a desire for an independent homeland.  The Washington Post item mentions the number of Uygurs held in Guantanamo as a result of the United States intervention in Afghanistan as 22 however previous reports have put this number at only 12. There has also been no positive identification of the nationalities of the Uygurs detained. The Uygur are spread throughout Central Asia and a sizeable population of Uygur have lived in Afghanistan for a considerable period of time and it is not unlikely that some of the Uygurs are not actually Chinese citizens.  U.S. Secretary of State spokesperson Boucher recently was quoted as saying the Uygurs held in Guantanamo were soon to be released as they posed no ongoing threat or are required to face criminal charges. Several Humanitarian organisations including Amnesty International have warned against those Uygurs holding Chinese nationality being returned to China for fear of their imprisonment or even execution. Boucher also stated at the time that the US was in negotiation with several unidentified countries who may be willing to provide safe haven for the Uygurs on their release.  Whilst the right of foreign diplomatic personnel to have access to their nationals is not at issue, to have those personnel involved in interrogation and mistreatment of those nationals as alleged here is abominable. The US and China should be called on to make an immediate statement in response to these very serious allegations.

						    China's population policies.    How do you solve a conundrum as complex as the developing of policies aimed at achieving a sustainable population level whilst delivering equal economic opportunity and quality of life to the people of a land that is almost at the end of it’s resource capacity?  A land where existing inequalities are already significant and will, if left unchecked, only grow at an exponential rate. A land where requisite infrastructure investment,  both in economic and human capital, to rectify the imbalances of today alone defy comprehension as to their size and temporal requirements let alone the problems of the tomorrow.  When looking into an abyss one is struck with a feeling of both wonderment and fear. Wonder at the sheer size and fear that one will fall or be pushed into its gaping blackness.  Such must be the feelings of China’s leadership as the future is paraded before them, a future of incredible wonderment as to challenges that would require the wisdom of ten Solomons and the dreaded fear of what will happen if those challenges go unmet.  This situation China find herself in today and, more importantly, where it will find itself tomorrow, has not come about unexpectedly. 25 years ago the Chinese Government recognised the exact nature of the predicament that the country was in and took the unheard of steps of announcing a “One Child Policy” in an attempt to slow the tide that was rushing in on their country. As a result of this policy it is estimated that some 300 million Chinese children were not born and would not go on to beget others.   Three hundred million unborn children were effectively sacrificed in order to buy time, for, that is all it has done, bought a little more time to hopefully allow a solution to be found for a problem that will not only engulf China, if it goes unsolved, but the whole world.   To the uninitiated statistics in China are mind boggling. One hears figures and attempts to relate them in some orderly way to known things.  China’s population at the end of 2003 was estimated at 1.29 billion people, 21% of the population of the whole world. 64 times the size of Australia (20m) 21 times the size of Great Britain (60m) and 4 times the size of the United States (290m). It is estimated it will grow to 1.448 million by 2020 and 1.6 billion by mid century.  China’s population over the age of 16 will increase by the staggering number of 5.5 million people annually for the next twenty years, a number many times the size of most large cities. What does it take to provide an infrastructure and an economy to absorb and support a new State of Victoria, Australia (4.64m 2001) or Minnesota, USA (5.01m 2002 est), or two Greater Manchesters U.K. (2.48m 2001) every year, year in an year out for the next 20, all working aged people?  But these numbers are but one part of the equation. Throw in a gender imbalance that will see 30-40 million more men than woman by 2020 and the consequent social problems, toss in a population that  comprises 11.8% of people over 65  now and will grow to 17% in 2020 and  25% by mid century and the consequent problems of health care and social security.  All these figures are truly fantastic but when considered from a viewpoint that 25 years ago China was considered an undeveloped country (and still, despite it’s meteoric growth over the last ten years, technically remains so) the task ahead seems daunting. To mix metaphors not only are they coming from behind the eight ball but are coming from way, way back in the field.  Unlike developed countries there is no established and acceptable public health  system, no established social security regime, the quality (education levels) of the population is poor and there exists, despite a burgeoning economy, a huge structural unemployment problem that will only get worse. Unlike western countries where services exist and can grow in a timely and orderly manner with demand in China the demand precedes the services.   There are also huge divides as between the east of the country and the west, the urban and the rural in terms of income, investment, infrastructure and quality of life. Divides that potentialy are the sources of major social upheaval.  Then we have the resources situation. China is quickly losing the capacity to feed itself or provide itself with the necessary energy supplies to maintain the status quo let alone continue its necessary growth into the future. History tells us to beware a country starving of food and energy.  How can all of this be addressed and what will be the outcome if it is not? Can we realistically push for democratisation of a country that has so many other challenges facing it that alone seem insurmountable? Does the Chinese Government more fully appreciate the implicit “peril” of the situation more so than the developed west which has troubles just coming to terms with the absolutes let alone the relatives?   When China says we must take care of the whole rather than the individual is it because the problems are too great to even scratch the surface let alone dig to the lower levels where the concept of “individual’ resides?  China seems to be the center of the economic world at the moment but perhaps it should be the center for other reasons.   There is an old Chinese saying " May you live in interesting times ". I think in the next fifty years or so we might all be doing just that.

						    Liverpool UK threatened with losing sister city status     I am constantly amazed at the time and effort the People's Republic of China goes to in it's constant one sided "battle" with the  urlLink  Dalai Lama  the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists.  Wherever the 69 year old Lama visits the PRC uses diplomatic channels, bully tactics and threats in an attempt to have the host city or state act as it wishes towards the Dalai Lama.  Recently in Canada the Chinese threatened economic sanctions if a planned meeting between the Dalai Lama and Canada's prime minister Martin went ahead. Now a planned visit to the UK has drawn the Chinese governments attention.  Chinese officials have reportedly threatened to strip the UK port city of Liverpool of its twin-city status with Shanghai in protest over the Dalai Lama's visit there beginning this week. The city has laid out a welcome mat to the Tibetan leader and apparently has no plans to change his itinerary in spite of Chinese pressure.  The linked article by the  Guardian   also states that the Chinese are piqued by planned meetings by the Lama with the British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, Michael Howard, the Conservative leader and Prince Charles, son of the Queen of Britain.  The amount of hatred that must exist in the halls of the Chinese Communist party and in particular the Politburo is really beyond comprehension. In 1959 when the then young Lama fled a country in rebellion against a young Communist China yes, it would be understandable, but in 2004?  It is as irrational as it  is unjustified and must give warning to the world that a leopard does not change it's spots even when now donning a bright new business suit.

						      Renewed Calls For Armed Uprising    Reaction by Tibetans in exile has been quick and vociferous to the release in China on Sunday of the Government's White Paper on Tibet.   Exiled Tibetans have come out universally against the "Paper" but at this stage it has drawn no response from the  urlLink  Dalai Lama  or the Tibetan Government in exile located in Dharamsala India.   Phayul.com , a leading Tibetan news agency, in an a report on the "White Paper"  urlLink "China tells Dalai Lama self-ruled Tibet not an option"  sees it as a final rejection of the Dalai Lamas attempts to open up direct dialogue between himself and the CCP.  Comments posted on Phayul's website universally condemn the "White Paper". One commentator posed the question of the Tibetan Government in Exile and it's leader  Samhdong Rimpoche    How Samdhong Rimpoche is going to react at that?  after trying everything to appease them and conceding everything, the thieves are at last giving their answer; no autonomy !  Let us demand and obtain our independence now !  Peu Gyalo !  Posted by Tenam Paris    Several posts call for stronger action including armed rebellion and "terrorist" like resistance tactics.   No more room for negotiation left on table. So where we are standing now! I guess, we must flip our standing and choose the violent, if they really don't care about our present proposal.  Get the fund, recruits and act some practice....Lets do whatever so that those pig's will awake and start making pork-chop!  (Tashi Toronto)   Ughur,Mongolia,Manchuria and Tibet should get together and get rid off all PLO communists from their countries.Till now we have been very patient with the communists and expect they will with changing time change for better for the last 45 years. Unfortunately communist china has not changed at all,instead got worse. So we are left with no choice but have to take the only last resort which is Bin laden`s tactic.  We give one more chance till December 2004.  PLO   Not all Tibetans have been happy with the "softly softly" anti-violence approach of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government in Exile both whom have adopted a policy of achieving greater political and cultural autonomy for Tibetans through peaceful negotiations with China.    The Dalai Lama has been on record for several years as having given up as one of his aims the total independence of Tibet. He has been forthright in saying that China's economic involvement in Tibet was actually beneficial to the Tibetan people.   Many Tibetans including a lot of younger ones living in exile in Dharamsala and elsewhere have never believed that such an approach would work with China. The younger ones, many who have never seen their homeland, are increasingly advocating violence.  During the recent " Hunger Strike " of three Tibetans in New York many younger posters to Phayul's Comments section derided the action calling it outdated, ineffective and typical of the Dalai Lama's appeasement approach to Beijing.  Meanwhile the Chinese news organs are giving plenty of coverage to the "White Paper". The  China Daily   gives some insight into the motivation of the Chinese Government in releasing this White paper when it said today   "The issuing of the white paper responds to international propaganda and lobbying by the Dalai Lama, who alleged that the regional ethnic autonomy in Tibet was "devoid of essential contents" and proposed the exercise of "one country, two systems" and "a high degree of autonomy" in Tibet after the model examples of Hong Kong and Macao"  urlLink  (China Daily)        urlLink Readers' Comments - www.phayul.com#4420#4420#4420#4420#4420

						    China Trots Out the "Daddy" of it's "justification" arsenal    On the 17th of this month I posted an article entitled  urlLink Dalai Lama's World Trips Stirring Up The Anthill?  in which I commented that the Chinese Government is nothing if not a predictable body. I observed that it is like clockwork that as soon as the CCP receive any adverse international press or even if they anticipate that they will, they begin to churn out through their official news organs what I have called " Justification Pieces "  These "justification pieces" generally are several "news" articles appearing in close succession which attempt to "sell" to the world all the good points of China's involvement in the issue that is under the  world spotlight, or, that they expect soon will be.   Alternatively they will set the stage for an expected event by publishing negative pieces on the target. Late last year (2003) for example they published several news items on "Uygur Terrorism" in quick succession before their ultimate article in December "naming" "Uygur terrorists" and "terrorist organisations".   In an article I published at the time in response,  urlLink  "China's 'Bin Laden' The terrorist Leader China Forgot" , I argued that the naming of "Uygur Terrorists' in the ultimate article was not spontaneous but had not only obviously been pre scheduled but was done so some months in advance. My reason for drawing that conclusion was that the number one, most wanted, "terrorist" leader named, the Chinese equivalent of the United States'   Bin Ladin , had actually been dead for two months (a fact China was aware of having helped identify the body). Someone within the government or Xinhua was just not interested enough to check and update the copy before it was published.  Whilst in this latter instance I could not at the time connect the reason for that particular period of activity I believe now that the timing of the articles, in the lead up to Ramadan which has been a period that has seen the major incidences of Uygur dissent such as the Yining (Guljha) incident in February 1997. I suspect that the Chinese government perhaps expected something might happen and were setting the stage so that if they had to instigate any harsh crackdowns they could justify it as a response to renewed "Uygur terrorism"  My recent article on the Dalai Lama stirring up "Anthills" came as a result of several justification pieces that appeared on Tibet in the week or so prior to my post. I stated that I believed that these were in direct response to the very positive press (ergo negative for China) that the Dalai Lama was receiving on his highly successful trip to Canada on which, despite China's protests, he was met by the Canadian prime minister and held several successful outdoor rallies. Also at the time the  Tibetan "Hunger Strike"  in front of the U.N. Building in New York was getting some pretty high level and positive responses from the U.N.  One thing I was not aware however was that the ninth anniversary of the  urlLink  kidnapping  of the  11th Panchen Lama  was coming up in May as well, an anniversary which the CCP might also have expected some renewed international agitation and protest for news of his fate (which did not eventuate I might add as an aside). To coincide with this event they even  urlLink trotted out  the "pretender" to the Panchen Lama throne.    Big Gun Rolled Out   Now today the big guns have been brought to bear. The daddy of all "justification pieces" the famous   Chinese Government "White Paper"  has been released and carried in full by Xinhua and the People's Daily and, coincidences of coincidences today's topic is Tibet.  The  released "White Paper" is entitled   Regional Ethnic Autonomy in Tibet  in which the Chinese government attempts to prove to the world that the Tibetans really are the masters of their own destiny although they do receive plenty of loving support from "papa" Beijing.  These "White Papers" are of significance for two reasons. Firstly they usually provide facts and insights that are not normally available, albeit in a far from impartial way, and, secondly and more importantly, they are a window to topics China is feeling either vulnerable on at the time or about issues that she wishes to 'sell".  Past papers, and there are usually two or three a year, have covered topics such as "Human Rights" (several) Tibet (several) Taiwan (several) the "Uygur Question", population policy and the environment.  Xinhua  on it's English web edition has a page of links to past papers going back several years as does the  Chinese Embassy in Washington .  Has the Dalai Lama really stirred the anthill so much or is there something else afoot? Could they be about to formally reject overtures from the Dalai Lama for a meeting on the future of Tibet? Could it be Taiwan?   That is the question. Stay tuned for further developments and hopefully an answer!

						      83 Dead in 20 days     I reported  urlLink here  back on April 28 that the Chinese government had released a report on workplace accidents and fatalities for the first trimester in which they reported that   "Coal related deaths dropped 25 per cent during January-April period with 1,267 deaths reported in 854 registered cases. The total output of coal was up 19 per cent up over the same period the previous year."   It was not that the government were boasting about this decline but I stated at the time that it was more a case of good luck rather than good management and that with the ridiculous demands placed on the coal mining industry by China's economy it was only a matter of time before deaths started to skyrocket.  I link here to Steve Frost's excellent  Asian Labour News  weblog where he has been following and recording some recent tragic events in China's mining industry far more closely than I have been able to.    In the last 20 days Stephen reports that, as a result of several coal mining accidents, 83 miners have died with  several still remaining unaccounted for.   83 dead in 20 days .   The horrible thing though is that whilst these figures seem alarming, and they are, they are light in comparison to the   20 or so fatalities  on average per day  officially recorded for last year. Some independent analysts have even put the unofficial figure as high as  30 per day.    That is right! Every single day of the year on average between 20 and 30 human beings going about their daily working life hoping to provide for their wives and children and in manty cases extended families, just like you and I, leave for work in the morning and do not come home.      Death Incorporated   When devising a photo composite as a lead in to stories on China mining accidents I stuttered over the caption "Death Incorporated" because it seemed to dramatise and even trivialise a tragic situation, but, each time I embed that photo for each new tragedy I feel more and more that it truly reflects exactly what is going on in China's mining industry.   Coal mining is dirty and yes it is dangerous but in most large coal producing countries the worst by-product of coal mining is pollution although not unheard of deaths are relatively and mercifully rare. Not so China, China's mining industry output is measured in tonnes and deaths and, what is worse, death appears an acceptable " cost of doing business ".   After each and every sizeable tragedy the Government announces investigations and reforms just as Stephen Frost reports in the linked article they have done now.   But it is all window dressing for after national and international scrutiny and disapprobation has died down it is back to business as usual with a relieved sigh. Because at the rate the government has the " steam train " that is the Chinese economy going they just can not afford to cut back on coal production which fuels 70 percent of China's energy requirements.And these energy requirements are growing at a rate of approximately 19 percent per annum.  Last year  urlLink Premier Wen Jiabao  announced after some other significant mining tragedies massive reforms in the industry. Illegal mines were to be tracked down and closed, mines lacking in safety were to be closed or were at least to greatly reduce their production until safety problems were rectified.  So extensive however is the safety issue in China's mining industry that the crackdowns effected so many mines, including even State Owned enterprises (SOE's), that the economy started immediately to feel the effects. As a result word quietly went out to officials from the Politburo to get everything back to previous output levels as quickly as possible before the measures could be fully implemented. They even called for greater output.  So the illegal mines went back to work, the unsafe mines kept sending the lambs to slaughter and the officials corrupt and elsewhere looked the other way and this miracle economy maintained steam.    International Community Must Get Involved    The international community has to bring pressure to bear on the Chinese government to begin a process of real reform to the Chinese mining industry. But criticism alone will not work. The international community needs to help supply solutions because I think it is beyond China's ability to do it on her own. They have got themselves on a treadmill that they can not get off.   A first step would be for those fools at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the European Union (EU)to get off China's back about meeting what is, in light of this ongoing tragedy, unrealistic and ultimately inhumane coke export commitments.   If I torture and kill you am I any more of a human rights violator than a government that knowingly sends 10,000 men to their deaths each year? Or for that matter an international community that prefers to look the other way?

A  Human Rights In China  press release states that sources within China have stated that one of the Tiananmen Square dissident leaders Zhang Ming has been granted a retrial by China's Supreme Court over non related charges for which he is serving a custodial sentence.  According to the press release:   Zhang Ming, one of the student leaders of the 1989 Democracy Movement, previously served three years in prison on charges of “counterrevolutionary incitement.” His most recent detention began on September 9, 2002, when he was arrested on charges of “endangering public safety” through an alleged plot to explode a multistory building. At the time of his arrest, Zhang Ming was president of a successful Shanghai company, and the amended charge on which he was ultimately convicted related to his business.   According to another source  urlLink China Support Network   Zhang Ming, a native of Jilin,was born in 1965 and enrolled in Tsinghua University in 1984 to study automotive engineering. He became involved in the student protests in the spring of 1989, and eventually took on a leadership role among the protesters at Tiananmen Square. Following the violent official suppression of the protests on June 4, Zhang Ming organized and led a series of follow-up protest actions that put him on the Chinese government’s “Most Wanted” list.  With regard to his current jail sentence China Support Network claim Zhang was arrested on September 9, 2002 on charges of “endangering public safety” through an alleged plot to explode a multistory building.    "At the time of his arrest, Zhang Ming was president of a Shanghai company that he had built into a flourishing concern. Given Zhang’s obvious dedication to his company, the authorities apparently realized that the accusation of violent activity could not be supported. On October 16, 2002 he was formally charged with “abuse of executive benefits,” for which the Shanghai Intermediate People’s Court sentenced him to seven years in prison on September 9, 2003." (China Support Network)  According to several sources the real reason for Zhang Ming’s arrest was his refusal to recant his political principles or express regret for his previous actions, and the ill feeling and envy that his financial success aroused among Chinese officials.

						     "'My personal feeling is that we are living in China's best ever period of religious freedom.'"      So said  Su Deci , vice president of the  China Christian Association   responding to the recent US Congressional report on religious freedom worldwide in which China was severely criticised.   Su has been supported in his "slamming" of the report by the leaders of several official religious associations in China including the Buddhist, Taoist and Islamic associations.  An "Official Religious" organisation is one registered with the Chinese government and abiding totally by strict government rules.   Whilst one would not wish to draw aspersions upon the various religious leaders quoted in the People's Daily report one can not help feeling the all pervasive hand of the government propagandists in it's authorship.  To quote the Chinese Islamic Association leader  Chen Guangyuan    "The commission's annual report is full of lies and accusations that are made out of thin air. It is a textbook example of the cheating nature of the US's human rights," said Chen Guangyuan, president of China's Islamic Association.   "The American troops' abuse of Iraqi war prisoners violated not only international human rights conventions but Islamic religious tenets. A Muslim, especially a female one, should never expose their bodies before others, but US soldiers willfully abuse them by adopting practices that go against their religions," Said Chen.   "Does the U.S. have any qualification or power to speak of other countries' affairs? They should merely mind and improve their own human rights situation instead," he said.   Now the Islamic Association in China is hardly representative of the majority of Muslims being primarily a  urlLink Hui Muslim  organisation. The Hui are ethnically and culturally far more similar to the majority Han Chinese than the Turkic Muslims of  urlLink Xinjiang  in particular the Uighur people and receive a much higher level of freedom of religion.  Whilst no-one can argue with the reasons for Chen's disgust over the treatment of Iraqi prisoners and, as he states, the methods of humiliation employed are particularly offensive to Muslims, one wonders if his allusions to the incident are not rather politic especially when one considers the many reports as to very similar religion-centric treatment being dished out to Uygurs prisoners including being forced by officials to eat pork and various humiliations of Muslim woman.  Simarly many Tibetan Buddhists I am sure would not agree with the sentiments of  Jia Muyang , vice president of the  China Buddhist Association   nor most Catholics with those of Liu Deshen, a "noted Catholic leader"  There is no doubts that religious freedoms, for those willing to tow the official line at least, are improving in China but for the likes of the Uygur, the Tibetans and those not willing to practice the government approved method of their religion,improvements, if any, are much fewer.

						     Experts say worst period over        "More sandstorms are likely to hit southern parts of Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region though the worst period is over".    Xinhua.   Each year in the period from March to May, especially in April, China experiences incredible sandstorms that rise in the  urlLink Taklamakan Desert  in  urlLink Xinjiang  causing considerable disruption and damage to wide areas of China including Beijing.   So far this year Xinhua reports, China has experienced 17 sand drifting or flowing weather systems including one strong sandstorm, five average ones and 11 drifting or flowing sand phenomena.   A sandstorm between March 26-30, again according to Xinhua, delayed more than 1,200 flights including 130 flights in Beijing Capital International Airport with 20 others forced to land at airports in Tianjin, Zhengzhou, Taiyuan and Dalian.   The linked reference source states that in recent years sandstorms have been occurring more frequently and with enhanced intensity. This is related to the frequent spells of unusual weather and the global climatic changes over the past century but is exacerbated by land desertification as a result of excessive cultivation of farmland, deforestation, over-grazing and excessive use of water resources.    "Severe sandstorms started to occur frequently after the 13th century, and increased rapidly after the 18th century. The number of severe sandstorms grew rapidly after the founding of the People's Republic of China. There were five in the 1950s, eight in the 1960s, 13 in the 1970s, 14 in the 1980s and 20 in the 1990s. The frequency is rising." us.tom.com  These severe sandstorms can be devastating. In 1961 a severe sandstorm hit  urlLink Turpan  in Xinjiang accompanied by a  Force 12  wind and lasted for 13 hours, sweeping 85 percent of the crops of the county. Over 6,700 hectare of wheat ready to be harvested, which had a per-unit output of only 4.5 kg, and 2,667 hectare of cotton and 4,000 hectare of sorghum were blown away.  The two main areas where sandstorms cause serious problems in Xinjiang and China is in the   Tarim Basin  and  Tulu-Bishan-Toksun Basin , through  Gansu Province  to northern  Shaanxi  and the  Kalpin ,  Hotan ,  Minfeng  and  Geermu  route in Xinjiang. Apparently severe sandstorms can continue for long periods in this area.    urlLink Further reading on China Sandstorms     Link Read Rating:      urlLink

						      How co-incidental.   Almost 9 years to the day that the Chinese government kidnapped the Dalai Lama selected  11th Panchen Lama,  six year old   Gedhun Choekyi Nyima  , (seen on left) up pops this Xinhua news item on a visit by the Chinese "pretender" Panchen Lama to Shanxi Province.   Bainqen Erdini Qoigyijabu , the so called "Eleventh Panchen Lama" was selected by the Government two weeks after the disappearance of the real Panchen Lama who was supposedly taken into custody by the Chinese for his "own protection". To this day, nine years later, he has not been seen or heard of. There have been several reports that in fact he is dead.  The article quotes that Bainqen Erdini Qoigyijabu     called on religious believers to carry on the fine tradition of loving the motherland and religion and safeguard national unity.    Somehow I do not think your average Tibetan would be caught voluntarily uttering such affirmations.   Link Read Rating:          urlLink

						     US official recommends a decentralized American model for China    I link to an excellent speech given by United States Representative James A. Leach Chairman, Congressional-Executive Commission on China and Chairman, House Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific in which he discuses the prospects of the democratisation of China and whether "decentralized democracy" is a possible model for a developing and evolving China.  Whilst at the end I feel I have learnt more about democracy in America than it's prospects in China the speech does require you to think deeply about the whole question. In particular his analysis of   China-Taiwan-US relations  is very insightful.  In essence Leach's position can be summed up in one quote from his speech   It is my thesis that just as Americans would be wise to learn from older elements of Chinese civilization, particularly as we contend with modern problems of family break-down and urban violence, the Chinese might want to review the possibility that the decentralized American model of democratic government fits their society better than it fits smaller, more homogenous countries, including those in Europe.   With respect to my American readers, we are quite used to America and Americans championing the US model of democracy as being the  creme de la creme  the " piece de resistance " of democratic models and, at first glance, this quote would lead you to believe that this tradition is being maintained. However, in this instance, Leach is able to develop a reasonable thesis or at least one worthy of deeper consideration.  I have long pondered a "democratic model" for China and I am not backward in saying that I do not consider myself learned enough to go toe to toe with the likes of Leach on such matters. I do however have certain gut feelings.  Firstly the likes of democracy in the United States and Australia was forged by what I would call "social individualism" that is, by people who prided themselves on surviving as an individual or family unit in a new land but mindful of a commonality of experience, of objectives and even in many instances of survival.   This would be exemplified in Australia at least by the "lowest of the low"  feeling he has the right to slap the prime minister on the back and say 'hey mate you better pick your game up". Neither the prime minister or any Australian would be unduely surprised by such an action. This individualism however is tempered by social connectivity, again, in Australia the tradition of "mateship" or in America "patriotism"  The Chinese are not like this. They have not experienced the "pioneering" spirit' born of American's and Australian's unique colonial histories where reliance on self was important for survival but so also was reliance on "community". That is not to say they the Chinese are not highly individualistic. A mistake many westerners make is believing that being in a population the size of China's one must, by the very nature of living in such a crowded land, be socially minded. But the reverse is true. The very size and history of China has meant that the Chinese for survival have developed a culture of "dog eat dog" where your main consideration, and perhaps only allegiance, is to yourself and your immediate family. This goes a long way in understanding their positions on the rights of the individual being subordinate to that of the mass and in such particular instances as capital punishment.  I believe you only have to look, for example, at the popularity of team sports in Australia and America  vis a vis  China. Mahjong and gambling are very big in China, why?. Because they are "one on one", each man for himself.  As Leach points out in his example of a Tiananman Square protester when being asked for his definition of the democracy that they were demonstrating for his answer was "less  corruption ", not universal suffrage, not  "liberte, egalite, fraternite"   just less corruption. As Leach alludes to, without probably understanding the juxtaposition to his own thesis, ideas of democracy and what one expects from democracy differ, both over time and over cultures.  The point I am labouring to make is that whilst the American system, the Australian system,the Westminster system whatever, works well for those particular countries we must not be blinkered in the belief that these are the be all and end all of systems for China.The Chinese are historically and cultural at the other end of the spectrum to America or Australia and as such have different expectations and levels of satisfaction on different aspects of life.  However, just as the ancient Greek system of democracy differs from modern theories of democracy, so may China's ultimate model differ as well. Different, but, democracy nonetheless.  Life and history is about evolution. Evolution of species and evolution of thoughts and political systems.  Leach's speech got me thinking at least and may I suggest you have a read as well and perhaps if you feel inclined share your thoughts.

						     Corruption in China is a major problem of that there can be no doubt. It's claws and tentacles permeate the very fabric of Chinese society and adversely impacts upon human rights.  China's apparent "crackdown" and focus on official corruption can only be praised and encouraged.  That having been said the use of capital punishment in the case of  persons convicted of corruption, official or otherwise, as in the case of the official recounted in the linked article, can not be advocated despite Beijing's belief that it provides a very powerful deterrent.

						   "Brazilians climb on  bandwagon  of bilateral trade with China" screams the headline. "Brazilians  clamour  for bilateral trade with China" cries another.  The Financial Times of London and it's writer Jonathan Wheatley choose the words " clamour " and " bandwagon " when talking of the Brazilian president's trade orientated visit to Beijing.    Clamour/ n. shouting, confused noise: protest, demand (Australian Little Oxford Dictionary)." Bandwagon /n. join popular or successful cause (ibid.)     And that very much describes the scene as the nations of the world stream continually into Beijing hoping and sometimes even begging to get a piece of the economic action.   Diplomats, "Captains of Industry", state leaders, pushing and shoving to get on and maintain their position on the bandwagon to the Great Hall of China.  Confusion, noise, permeates the scene and ideals and ethics are lost in the millieu.  I cringe when I read the press reports day in day out of this lemming rush to Beijing. What is worse these leaders, these captains of industry and these diplomats are lauded universally when they "ink" the deal, to use the current buzzword.   What About Human Rights?     What about human rights? Have we forgotten what we stand for in the democratic west, what we have fought two world wars for? Have we forgotten that we supposedly fought those wars and lost so many people so that people everywhere could live in freedom and with basic justice and human rights?,  Is the oppression of the Uygurs and Tibetans something that we can conveniently overlook in the headlong rush to sup at the table of China's economy? Do we ignore that China can kidnap a six year old child right from under the supposed watchful eyes of our great democracies and hold him incommudicado for 9 years (if he still lives), as it has done with the 11th Panchen Lama, whilst thumbing it's nose at international pressure?  Does the 10,000 odd miners who die each year to stoke this economic steam train that is China count for nothing in our dealings? Falun Dong, underground Christians,prison and legal systems, censorship, corruption, torture and executions? Are these issues that too can be so easily swept under the carpet and out of the view of our supposed high moral conscience.  The obvious answer is yes.  I do not advocate that we do not trade with China or we do not enter into meaningful diplomatic dialogue. I argue that they need us as much as we are becoming to need them so why can we not seek trade-offs before we "ink" that deal?  Why can we not make trade with China somehow conditional on her human rights record?  Why? Because we are fearful that in the clamour and headlong rush of nations and business we may fall off the bandwagon and miss out on this pot of gold that supposedly awaits us at the end of China's rainbow.  Someone once said, and I forget whom, that an "appeaser" is the one hoping that the crocodile will eat him last. In our dealings with China are we not like that appeaser.    I would also pose this question to our leaders, our diplomats and our "captains of industry":  " what does it profit a man to gain the world but lose his soul "    urlLink FT.com

						      Two welcome signs of Reform     The China Daily, one of China's official government news organs,  has published an article on prison reform that I find of considerable interest on two points.  Firstly the article announces that a nationwide investigation will be jointly launched later this month (May) by the  Supreme People's Procuratorate , the  Ministry of Public Security  and the  Ministry of Justice  investigating  problems existing in China's penal system.   The investigation apparently will focus on prison officials illegal practices in an attempt to    "safeguard the justice of the law and protect prisoners' legitimate rights and interests." and to ensure "Efforts are being made nationwide to build a prison system that is just, incorruptible, free of abuses and highly efficient, and to guarantee prisoners' legitimate rights and interests."   The article claims that this initiative follows a series of prison reforms carried out of late by the Ministry of Justice to protect the rights of prisoners. These reportedly have included new protocols such as "Regulations on Reform Through Re-education in Prisons," and "Regulations on the Procedures for Applications by Prisons for Commutation and Parole" .  Focus of this new investigation will be on reforming the ways of imposing punishment in prisons and the methods of prison management.  According to the article there exists within the prison system widespread abuse of power by prison officials including corruption and the use of unlawful discretionary power with respect to issues such as reducing prisoners' penalties, releasing prisoners on parole and allowing prisoners to be bailed out for medical treatment.   China's prison system comes in from considerable criticism for it's treatment of prisoners including allegations of forced labour, torture, deaths in custody and human organ harvesting. Human rights websites such as the  urlLink Laogai Organisation  and the  urlLink Falun Dafa  carry many examples of the extent of human rights violations allegedly going on in China's prison system.  Whilst this announced investigation does not appear to have a mandate over these issues any accountability and oversight placed on the system will hopefully lessen human rights violation across the board and as such is to be welcomed.  The second point concerning the article that commanded my attention was it's closing "editorial" type statement. The China Daily respectfully reminds the govenment that    However, it should be pointed out that though no one questions the authorities' good intention in straightening out things behind the bars, problems concerning prisons cannot be solved by merely launching inspection movements.  Hence, the authorities should be mindful of the fact there is always a possibility old problems will resurface once the current initiative is concluded.  Whilst a little more circumspect than her western counterparts the China Daily comes out relatively strongly in reminding the government that it is one thing to announce reforms and investigations but another thing to carry them out.  The China Daily seems to be leading the way in bringing western, democratic style journalism to mainstream Chinese news reporting and I am often amazed at what it says and equally amazed as to how it gets away with it.  Well done China Daily and hopefully we will be able to say well done the Ministry of Justice.      Link Read Rating:        urlLink

						       Dalai Lama asked to betray a friend      The world jet setting urlLink  Dalai Lama  fresh from trips to Canada and Europe is heading off to Taiwan to take part in Thursday's inauguration of the second term of office of President Chen Shui-bian.  When asked to comment on the Lama's trip to Taiwan China's  Foreign Ministry Spokesman Liu Jianchao   effectively sent a message to the Dalai Lama that if he wanted negotiations between his representatives and Beijing to go ahead then not only must he recognise China's sovereignty over Tibet but also over Taiwan.     "We have repeatedly urged the Dalai Lama to recognise Taiwan as part of Chinese territory and give up his position of seeking independence of Tibet. Only by doing so, the central government of China can have dialogue with the Dalai Lama," Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao told reporters.  A rather big ask one would have thought. The Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists, has repeatedly and publicly stated for some years now that he has renounced all claims for an independent Tibet and that he wishes to negotiate with the Beijing government only for greater autonomy and freedoms for the Tibetan people.   To ask him now to also include the Tibetan people's long term supporter Taiwan into the equation by effectively asking him to betray a 'friend' would appear to indicate that China has no real intentions of entering into constructive dialogue with the Dalai Lama or his representatives.    It is clear their only aim is to belittle him and/or ignore him     "If the Dalai Lama has the sincerity to solve the (Tibet) question, he should admit and make a public statement, admitting that Taiwan and Tibet are part of Chinese territories," the spokesman said.  "The Dalai Lama must be very clear about the position of the Chinese central government," he noted.

						     China and Kazakhstan agree to fight "East Turkistan terrorism"   In Beijing on Monday Chinese  President Hu Jintao  and visiting  Kazakhstan President Nursultan Abishevich Nazarbayev  signed a joint statement signaling agreement on several issues of importance between their two countries.  One notable aspect of the statement from a human-rights perspective was the agreement on the joint combating of "terrorism" in the region.   The joint statement includes agreement that both countries consider    "terrorism, separatism and extremism as severe threats to global security and stability, and will expand bilateral and multilateral cooperation to campaign against those threats."   Not an unusual agreement between countries in this day and age however China has once again used a bi-lateral agreement to specifically raise the 'spectre' of 'East Turkistan' terrorism, a barrow it pushes ad nauseum in negotiations with foreign countries almost to the degree it pushes acceptance of it's "One China" Policy.   "The two sides will, within the bilateral agreed framework, continue to effectively strike terrorism in all forms and terrorist groups and terrorists recognized by the United Nations, including the "East Turkistan" force that imposes a direct threat to regional security and stability."    "East Turkistan" terrorism is a reference to the Uygur ethnic minority of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in China's north west which, prior to the Qing dynasty and for a short period in the 1940's, ran the independent Uygur state of   East Turkistan  in present day Xinjiang.   This Muslim Turkic minority of some 9 million has been accused by China continually since "9/11" as being a hotbed of Islamic extremism, separatism and terrorism despite there being no concrete evidence of "terrorist" type activity since 1997 when, in retaliation for a brutal suppression of an Uygur demonstration, unidentified  person or persons detonated a bomb on a bus in the Xinjiang capital of Urumqi killing five civilians.  The joint statement nicely dovetails some justification for this agreement by tying it to "terrorist groups and terrorists" recognised by the United Nations. This is in reference to the 2002 listing by the U.N. of a relatively unknown Uygur organisation the  East Turkistan Islamic Party (ETIM)  as an international terrorist group at the behest of China and with the support of the United States.  This 'agreement' between Kazakhstan and China is of concern for two reasons Firstly it ominously reiterates the Chinese government's assertions as to Uygur 'terrorism' which it has used since "9/11" as a pretext for its continuing violations of the Uygurs human rights and, secondly, it seconds Kazakhstan into this oppression.  Given that Kazakhstan borders Xinjiang and that it is predominantly a Muslim country sharing common ethnicity with the Uygurs it has been, historically, a destination for Uygur political refugees. This 'agreement' will formalise what has been, since 1999, a tacit understanding between the two governments that the Kazakhs would not allow such refugee movements.    Recently two Uygurs were executed by the Chinese after being repatriated from neighboring Kyrgystan despite the fact that the alleged crimes occurred on Kyrgyz soil (involving the death of a Chinese diplomat) and contravened United Nation's protocols forbidding the extradition of criminals to a country that is likely to invoke capital punishment.  This agreement between China and Kazakhstan seems to allow for similar instances to occur. All it will take now is for China to identify a person as being a terrorist for him to be repatriated from Kazakhstan to China and to an uncertain fate.

						        Disappearance of the 11th Panchen Lama        May 17th went pretty much unremarked in the world's Human-Rights and diplomatic circles but it marked the day in 1995 when Chinese officials went to the home of  Gehun Choekyi Nyima , then six years old, and spirited him and his family away never to be seen again.   Gehun Choekyi Nyima  at just six years of age was  the  11th Panchen Lama  of Tibet having been confirmed the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama just two weeks prior by the  Dalai Lama , spiritual leader of Tibets Buddhists. He was to become, on that fateful day, the highest ranking and  youngest religious political prisoner  in the world.  Since that date nothing has been seen or heard of the boy or his family other than the Chinese Government admitting in 1996 that they had him under their " protection ".   "he has been put under the protection of the government at the request of his parents" one official commented at the time saying that "the boy was at risk of being kidnapped by 'separatists'"  Two weeks after his disappearance in May 1995 the Chinese Government announced that  a new Panchen Lama had been identified by Tibetans independent of the Dalai Lama. This "new" Panchen Lama was selected by Beijing and he too was moved to the Chinese capital.   Rumours of Gehun Choekyi Nyima death are several but one in particular, dating back to 1999, is believed by many to be true. It was said that a " small emaciated body " described as a "major criminal" was taken from a prison in  Gansu  for secret cremation. "Eye witness reports" claim the body was that of a boy resembling the Panchen Lama.  Despite numerous calls from the international community in the early days (dying in number now) the whereabouts or health of the now 14 year old is unknown and he remains the most high profile and youngest political and religious prisoner in the world.  When you think how we can carry on and have normal trade and diplomatic relations, with a clear conscience, with a state, any state, that is capable of making a six year old child and his family political prisoners is beyond comprehension.    How our diplomats and leaders and "Captains of Industry" can shake the hands of child kidnappers and sleep at night is truly beyond me. How we can so quickly forget is unpardonable.

So it is not surprising that the organs of state news have been dong what they tend to do quite well, pumping out the "justification pieces"  Of late we have had several articles on Tibet; articles on blind schools, cataract prevention, and infrastructure provision . We have even had, if you can believe it, a story about how well the 900 prisoners in Tibet jails enjoyed their Tibetan New Year celebrations. Apparently they all enjoyed a thrilling game of soccer.  Today we have a piece from the  China Daily  trumpeting the improvements of life in Tibet.   China's Tibet Autonomous Region has made great strides forward in both providing basic public services and in poverty reduction.  The article goes on to say   Basic public services enjoyed by Tibet's farmers and herdsmen are the best examples of government efforts to give the region's people a better life, according to the findings of a Chinese Academy of Social Sciences research team, who investigated the situation in July and August of last year.  The China Daily provides an impressive list of achievements    food security in the region has been further improved by the agricultural and pastoral support system.   The central government has invested an annual sum of 300 million yuan (US$36 million) in infrastructure projects for developing the agricultural and pastoral areas in Tibet in recent years.   The central government has scrapped taxes levied on Tibet's farmers and herdsmen.   Free compulsory education    Government-assisted health care insurance   Relief programmes and aid to the old and those without children:    Upgrading of power and water supply facilities   Satellite television and telecommunication services:    More non-farming jobs have been created to increase local people's incomes   Then we have the catchall   Compared with other parts of China, Tibet is the most eye-catching region of the country, and the State Council has issued more White Papers on Tibet than any other regions. Public attention thus has become an effective supervisory force. Transparency has been enhanced through the further disclosure of information.  Please do not get me wrong, there are some good things happening in Tibet as a result of China's involvement, even the Dalai Lama acknowledges that, but the bad things continue as well and we should not be blinded to that by nice "wrapping paper".  My point in this post is that the casual observer of China should be aware that when we get a plethora of "good spin" news such as the articles I have alluded to it is either 1)as a result of bad press elsewhere in the world or 2) in anticipation of bad press or 3) a lead in to changes the Government is about to implement that may get bad press.  I am no mathematician but the following quote appears to give the impression that as a result of Chinese initiatives Tibet's ethnic population is improving dramatically.   As living conditions improve, the population will increase too. The population of the Tibetan ethnic group in the Tibet Autonomous Region have increased from 1,718,238 in 1980 to 2,421,856 in 2000.   This is way less than the percentage increase in the Uygur population, for example, over the same period. Of course it does not provide numbers for those leaving Tibet, either as refugees or to China proper in search of work. Nonetheless the figures and the context do not equal the real relative position of population increases.   urlLink

						       In a country where all the land and housing has been owned by the state and where official corruption is rife, home and land tenure has never been a given in China.  A recent report out of Xinjiang, China's nominal "Uygur Autonomous Region", via  Radio Free Asia  once again illustrates that, in this time of China's burgeoning economy and despite recent amendments to the Chinese constitution allowing for private ownership of property, land tenure is not guaranteed even when you have a written lease.   According to the linked RFA article   "Authorities in the Uyghur region of Xinjiang in China's northwest are refusing to honor 30-year land-use contracts in a village near Artush city, forcing poor farmers away from their livelihoods to make way for a major property development"- RFA    It would appear that the local Artush county government had signed a deal with a Beijing company for the construction of a tourist resort on the outskirts of town. The problem being however is that the land is farmland over which the Uygur tenants had a written lease for a term of 30 years.  The total area of disputed land is about 700  mu  (46 hectares), which includes the farmers' houses, fruit and vegetable gardens, and croplands in Shurukh village, which is home to around 180 Uyghur households.  In compensation the Uygurs believed the original offer of compensation from the local government was the equivalent of US$8,700 and 1  mu  of undeveloped land for each  mu  of tenented land forfeited.   After some farmhouses had been demolished the farmers came to the realisation that the compensation offered was for 1  mu  of undeveloped land and only US$1,450 cash and it was at this stage they began their protest.  RFA claims that one Uygur was beaten by police and had his camera broken when he attempted to take pictures of his house being demolished.   "He was beaten pushed and beaten when he was trying to record ( the house demolition) He threw the camera to the other side of garden. And they jumped over and got the camera. Then they smashed it  one witness was reported to have said."- RFA    Forced evictions are commonplace in a land where the new market economy has led many local officials into the pockets of hungry land developers. Whilst, not the reason in every case, corruption plays a large part in the decision making process.  In a submission to the recently concluded UN Human Rights Commission hearings in Geneva  UNPO  (Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation) stated    "China's rapid economic development has led to forced evictions in urban and rural areas. Residents complain of lack of advance notice, low compensation, and violent evictions by hired thugs and bulldozers. Chinese laws permit forced evictions to continue even while residents are suing to prevent them; many courts refuse to hear the cases. Protests have escalated, and there has been a series of suicide protests. In response, police have jailed tenants rights advocates. The Chinese government has promised policy reforms, but while local Party officials can intervene to influence courts, these will be difficult to implement."- UNPO Submission   The  Epoch Times  reported only on March 10 of this year the death of an elderly Uygur man in Kashgar killed when a bulldozer leveled his house whilst he was inside attempting to stop it's demolition.  Much of this activity goes unreported in Xinjiang as many Uygurs fear government retribution if they attempt to protest or advertise their plight.

						      In response to the recently released  United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF)   urlLink report  in which China was heavily criticised for it's treatment of the Muslim Uygurs, Tibetans, Christian religious organisations and the spiritual group Falun Dong a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman has labeled the findings "groundless".  The annual report on the state of religious freedom world wide once again identified China as a " country of particular concern " (CPC)the highest category for countries where religious freedom is in serious doubt.  The report stated that the commission was   "especially concerned" with freedom of religion in China and that the Chinese government continues to engage in " particularly severe violations of religious freedom."  -U.S. Report    Foreign Ministry spokesman  Liu Jianchao   has responded on behalf of China by claiming that the report's findings were based on "heresay" and constituted nothing more than a "potshot" at the religious policies of China which  are constitutionally guaranteed and in his words "sufficient".   He went on to recommend that the US stop interfering in China's internal affairs and essentially advised the United States to look to it's own garden first.   Not an unexpected response but fairly tame in tone nonetheless.    urlLink :: Xinhuanet - English ::

						    I think  Xu Zhiyong  ,the Beijing lawyer that the Manila Times calls "charismatic " in the linked article, might be barking up the wrong tree in his belief that two of his clients are victims of "testing the limits of China's tightly controlled media".  Xu is defending  Yu Huafeng , former vice chief editor of the Guangzhou-based Nanfang Dushi Bao ( Southern Metropolitan Daily ), who was sentenced in March to 12 years in jail for graft.   He is also representing  Cheng Yizhong , the former editor in chief of the same paper, who has been formally charged with corruption.   This much celebrated case of alleged payback by Chinese officials for the editorial staff of the SMD overstepping the mark in exposing a SARS cover up and the police death in custody of a migrant worker has organisations such as  Reporters without Frontiers  up in arms.  It has seemed to have escaped them however that investigations into  claims of significant corruption at the Southern Metropolitan, a leading and highly profitable state owned newspaper group, were instigated by Chinese officials well before these incidents that are supposed to have spawned their current ire.   So significant was the apparent corruption problem that a leading Hong Kong property developer backed out of a multi-million dollar joint venture with the group to develop a shopping mall well before either of these two reporting incidents occurred.  But that aside the person really testing the limits is Xu. The Manila Times attributes, among others, the following quote to the 31 year old lawyer expressing some very forthright views :    "Some people accuse me of not respecting the independence of the justice system," he said.   "But the difference to developed countries is that this independence does not exist in China, and we must fight against the forces that prevent it from existing."    A quote that is sure to prick the ears of officialdom and hopefully will not come back to seriously bite this obviously courageous man in the future is his  remarks about the Communist revolution:    "China needs lawyers who fight for the rights of the citizens," he said defiantly, while acknowledging that a glaring opportunity has already been missed.   "During the last century, China was at a crossroads between reform and revolution. Unfortunately revolution was the choice."    I admire your courage and am bouyed by the thought that you feel the system has changed enough for you to expres such opinions without fear of reprisal, but, then again, the ink is hardly dry...       urlLink The Manila Times Internet Edition | OPINION > Defiant Chinese lawyer relishes defending citizens&#65533; rights

						    Among the 600 original captives from the United States' military intervention in Afghanistan held at Guantanamo Bay Cuba were 12 Uygurs from Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in China's northwest.   The Uygur are one of China's 56 ethnic minority groups and are by far the most culturally distinct ethnic group in China. They are a Turkic people who originated from the scores of nomadic tribes that ranged present day Mongolia and southern Siberia in the centuries before Christ. Along with other Turkic tribes of Central Asia, they were the forefathers of the modern day people of Turkey.  The Uygur once controlled a mighty empire in the 9th and 10th century C.E controlling much of Central Asia and present day Xinjiang. After their defeat at the hands of another Turkic tribe they were forced to move  en mass  to the outskirts of their former empire in present day Xinjiang and Gansu province. Here they lived virtually with autonomy until being subjugated by the Qing (Manchu) dynasty in the 18th century. Even from then  whilst nominally under the control of the Chinese it was not until the communist takeover of Xinjiang in 1949 that Chinese influence was well and truly asserted.  Whilst initially acceding to joining with Communist China (or at least not resisting) on the promise that Xinjiang would become an autonomous governing region within the Chinese state the realisation that this "autonomy" was  in name only saw the Uygur becoming increasingly less amenable to Han Chinese control in the ensuing years.   The "Great Leap Forward"  of the 1950's and the "Cultural Revolution" (1966-1975) were particularly hard on the Uygur bringing about dramatic changes to their way of life and increasing persecution of their religion. The Uygur are Muslim.  The break up of the former Soviet Union and the setting up of independent states in Central Asia gave hope to some Uygur that they too could throw off the shackles of Communist rule and in the period of 1990 to 1997 there was agitation towards this end. Two incidents in particular were of importance in this time frame one a "Revolt" in Baran ( a small Xinjiang township) in 1990 and the other the so called "Yining (Gulja) Uprising" in 1997.  Neither incident could truly be called events of magnitude or ones which derived from any universal Uygur ground-swell bent on armed revolt to obtain independence. They were however to prove to be events of significant consequence for the Uygur in many ways.  One consequence was that many Uygur were forced to flee Xinjiang to avoid prison and possible execution. Those from the "Baran era"  mostly were able to go to the newly formed "Turkic republics" of Central Asia where, at that time, they were welcomed. Those from the "Yining era" however were forced to flee Central Asia totally or go to Afghanistan, which had a sizeable Uygur population going back many years. The change of attitude among the central Asian states towards such political refugees came about due to increased Chinese diplomatic and economic pressure.  The Chinese have claimed since the 1997 Yining incident that there existed numerous Uygur "terrorist" organisations bent on violent separation of Xinjiang from China. These claims were intensified after "9/11' as it provided the Chinese government a degree of legitimacy in the eyes of the world in their "crackdown" on the Uygur.  The Chinese claimed, without much proof, post "9/11" that Uygur "terrorist" organisations were in league with both the Taliban and al Qaida. Among their claims was one that there existed in Afghanistan a "Chinese battalion" of upwards of 1,000 Uygur terrorists trained by the Taliban and  funded by Al Qaida for terrorist activities in China.  A world still reeling from the horror that was '9/11" looked upon such Chinese claims probably with a less judicious eye than they would have done in more normal times.   It was no surprise then, at least for those who championed the cause of the Uygur, that in the wash-up to the United State's intervention in Afghanistan only 12 Uygurs were detained among the 600 or so captured and sent to Guantanamo.   I said in an article written at the time of the release of the " Guantanamo numbers " that there being only 12 Uygurs among the 600 suggested fairly strongly that Chinese claims as to the existence of  numerous "Uygur terrorist" organisations with extensive memberships were hardly supported by the numbers, especially given Afghanistan's proximity to Xinjiang and the fact that there existed a sizeable Uygur population in Afghanistan from whom the Taliban could press into service ethnic Uygur men. Of course this is not to say there were not some Uygur there willingly with a view to furthering their desires for Uygur independence but by all accounts from Uygur sources their numbers were miniscule.  It has now been reported that the 12 Uygurs are about to be released as, in the words of the US  State Department spokesman Richard Boucher , they no longer are of "significant threat or may not be wanted on criminal charges."  This then must be final proof that Chinese claims as to Uygur links with Islamic extremism, al Qaida and terrorism were at the best tenuous or at worst just plain fabricated lies meant to mask their ongoing oppression of the Uygur people.  The question now is where are these 12 to go? Returning them to China will no doubt result in their execution regardless of their innocence or degree of "guilt". Any "guarantees" to their safety must be taken with a large grain of salt especially after Chinese officials went back on assurances given to the United States that a Tibetan executed in 2003 would have his trial reviewed by the Chinese Supreme Court before sentence was carried out. As well the Chinese carried out the execution of an alleged ringleader of the 1997 Yining incident only as recent as October 2003, some six years after most of the 124 sentenced to death over Yining were executed.  Once again it will more than likely be left to the U.S. to grant these Uygurs sanctuary as other nations will be too "frightened" of the economic ramifications of upsetting the Chinese Government by accepting these people.    urlLink Channelnewsasia.com: Guantanamo

						       Lake Tinachi or as it is otherwise known Heavenly Lake is a most beautiful lake some 70 kms northeast of Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang Uygur A.R., and is one of the top tourists attractions in Xinjiang and ranks very highly among China's best. It is much loved by the Uygur and Kazakh inhabitants of the area and is certainly a  must see  for anyone visiting Xinjiang.  According to one travel blurb Heavenly Lake (also just to confuse you sometime known as Jade Lake) is    Covered with firs, pines, cypresses and white snow, it boasts a spectacular sight- reminiscent of Switzerland or the Rocky mountains but somehow with more vibrancy and color. Amidst fields of wild flowers grow morel mushrooms, peppermint and rhubarb, while higher up the mountain are edelweiss and the rare creamy Snow Lotus (Saussurea involucrate), which grows from rock crevices and is believed to have magical powers as a medicinal cure.    According to the linked article Lake Tianchi though has been suffering of late and the government is stepping in to give it a little angelic help.     " URUMQI, May 14 (Xinhuanet) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has launched a comprehensive program to improve the ecological environment around the Tianchi Lake to protect it from further shrinkage.      The program will be carried out in three phases. Firstly, the region will spend 26 million yuan (3.13 million US dollars) to build dams in the upper reaches of the lake to decrease silt flow and to dig channels to divert water.      Secondly, some 15 million yuan (1.8 million dollars) will be used for resettling local herdsmen living in the upper reaches of the lake, and for developing 15,000 mu (1,000 hectares) of irrigated pasture for them.      And, thirdly, 14 million yuan (1.68 million dollars) will be spent for afforestation in the vicinity of the lake.      The Tianchi Lake, dubbed 'the Pearl of the Tianshan Ranges', covers a water area of 4.9 sq km and abounds in wildlife and other natural resources.      But in the past decade, farming, tourism and the lumber trade, among others, have resulted in deforestation and reduced grassland,and ensuing floods and landslides, leading to the shrinkage of thelake.      The lake's southern bank is now 18 meters closer to the center of the lake than 10 years ago and the depth of the lake has dropped to 80 meters from 100 meters. An area of nearly seven hectares of grassland in the southern bank is now denuded."    Link Read Rating:       urlLink :: Xinhuanet - English ::

						      The  United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF)   has just released (May 12) it's annual report on the status of religious freedom worldwide and has made some recommendations that will sure to upset the Chinese Government and bring from them the usual calls for the US to stop meddling in China's internal affairs.  The  USCIRF  is a U.S. independent legislative agency created by the United States  International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (IRFA)  to monitor religious freedom in other countries and advise the President, Secretary of State, and Congress on how best to promote it.  As predicted, in the case of China, the Commission has emphasized the plight of the  Muslim Uygurs  of Xinjiang, the  Buddhists Tibetans , the "unofficial"  Christian Churches   and the  Falun Gong   group. ( The latter by it's own admission is not a religion per se but more of a promoter of a spiritual life and as such it is strange that it's predicament appears to fall within the Commission mandate.)   One recommendation in particular that is sure to raise the hackles of the Chinese and very unlikely to be acceded to is that the US negotiate with China to allow the opening of an official US presence in both  urlLink Urumqi  the capital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and  urlLink Lhasa , capital of Tibet, to facilitate closer monitoring of the religious situation in both those regions.  As well the Commission called upon the US Government to do all in it's power to raise international awareness of the plight of the Uygur people and to establish an Uygur language radio staion transmitting into Xinjiang      Summary of the Commissions Findings On China     The Commission stated forthrightly in it's report that it is "especially concerned" with freedom of religion in China and that the Chinese government continues to engage in " particularly severe violations of religious freedom. ".      The Commission remains especially concerned about the situation in China, where repression of religious freedom continues to be a deliberate policy of the Chinese government.  In the past year, Chinese authorities have intensified their violent campaign against religious believers, including Evangelical Christians, Roman Catholics, Uighur Muslims, Tibetan Buddhists, and other groups, such as the Falun Gong.  This campaign has included imprisonment, torture, and other forms of ill treatment.  Following up on an invitation to the Commission reportedly without conditions, the Commission attempted to travel to China twice in the past year but was thwarted both times by unacceptable limits imposed by the Chinese government.  The Commission visited Hong Kong in early 2004, but continues to seek a visit to other regions of China.     The USCIRF has recommended to the U.S president that China be considered a " country of particular concern (CPC) " the highest level for countries considered to be religious violators of the worst kind.     "Chinese government officials control, monitor, and restrain religious practice, purportedly to protect national security or stability and public safety or health. However, the governmentÂs actions to restrict religious belief and practice reportedly go far beyond legitimate protection of security interests and exceed what is permissible under international law. By most accounts, prominent religious leaders and laypersons alike continue to be confined, tortured, imprisoned, and subject to other forms of ill treatment on account of their religion or belief."     Particular information as to the various findings are as follows:    Falun Gong       The Commission found that in 2003, the Chinese government has expanded its campaign against 'evil cults' and "heretical sects" of which the Falun Gong group is considered to be one.   The Falun Gong group has been banned since 1999 and has been identified as an "evil cult" and it is upon this basis that China attempts to justify it's ongoing " brutal crackdown"    The Commission alleges that     hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners have been sent to labor camps without trial or been sent to mental health institutions for re-education   430 practitioners have been killed as a result of police brutality   foreign businesses in China have been pressured to discriminate against its followers   Chinese diplomats regularly warn foreign officials to stop their advocacy on behalf of Falun Gong and its practitioners.       Tibet       On Tibet the Commission found that the Chinese government continues to retain tight control over religious activity and places of worship.   It notes that 2002-2003 saw several prominent Tibetan Buddhists being released from imprisonment however despite this and renewed contact between China and the  Dalai Lama's  representatives there has been no significant changes to the government's overall policy of control over Tibetan religious life.   By Chinese admission the Commission states that there are over one hundred Tibetan Buddhist monks and nuns being held in prison, a figure agreed on by Tibetan human rights groups who claim that the prisoners are subject to ongoing torture and degradation at the hands of their Chinese captors.  The Commission specifically mentions the cases of  Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche , a Tibetan Buddhist monk, and  Lobsang Dondrup   who were sentenced to death in January 2003 for an alleged April 2002 bombing in Sichuan province.  Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche's death sentence was eventually suspended, but Lobsang Dondrup was executed despite what the commission claims were assurances to senior U.S. officials that both cases would be referred to China's  Supreme Court .   Other incidents reported upon are:      October 2003, another monk, Nyima Dragpa died, reportedly as a result of repeated torture while serving a nine-year sentence for advocating Tibetan independence    The Chinese continue to deny repeated requests for access to the 15-year old boy whom the Dalai Lama designated as the 11th Panchen Lama and who was spirited away by Chinese officials never to be seen of again.       Uygur Muslims Of Xinjiang       The Commission found that in the case of the mainly Muslim Uygurs of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in China's north west, freedom of religion and belief is severely curtailed by the government, which often alleges that Uygur Muslim religious expression is linked to " separatist " or " terrorist " acts.   The Commission also found that      Since September 11, 2001, the government has used concerns about international terrorism as a pretext for an ongoing crackdown in Xinjiang, where Uighur Muslim clerics and students have been detained for "illegal" religious activities and "illegal religious centers" have been closed.     It goes on to report that since January 2003 the Government's campaign against the Uygur Muslims has intensified when the region's Communist Party Secretary announced the government's aim to " strike hard " against " religious extremists ", " splittists ", and " terrorists ", resulting in the arrest of many more Uighur Muslim clerics and lay leaders.   The Commission also highlighted the authorities prohibition on the teaching of Islam to children under the age of 18 and on minors entering mosques. As well it noted the Chinese government as not allowing teachers, professors, university students, or Party members to practice their Muslim faith openly.     Catholic and Protestant Churches    The report claims that the Chinese government continues its repression of the Roman Catholic and Protestant Churches in China and provides the following examples:      Clergy in Fujian, Zhejiang, Jilin, and Jiangxi provinces were harassed, detained, and arrested during the past year.   In July 2003, five priests affiliated with the Catholic Church were sentenced to three years in a labor camp after having been convicted of practicing "cult" activities.   In October 2003, Hebei provincial officials reportedly arrested twelve Catholic priests and seminarians attending a religious retreat.    There are at least ten Catholic bishops under arrest, including Bishop Su Zhimin, who has been in prison, in detention, under house arrest, or under strict surveillance since the 1970s.    Conditions for unregistered Christian groups have worsened in the last year. Members of Protestant house church groups, who refuse to register, are subject to intimidation, extortion, harassment, detention, and the closing of their churches.   Protestant house churches in Liaoning, Yunnan, and Henan provinces and in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were raided, their congregants detained and fined, pastors arrested, and churches closed   In September, house church historian Zhang Yinan was arrested along with approximately 100 others in Nanyang, Henan Province   Pastor Gong Shengliang of the unregistered South China Church sentenced to death after the adoption of the 1999 "evil cult" law, continues to languish in prison, and he is reportedly denied proper medical care. Many of his congregants and family remain in jail facing serious charges and are allegedly subject to torture and other ill treatment in prison   In the last year, local officials in Zhejiang province reportedly destroyed as many as 400 churches, temples, and shrines.    Chinese officials continue to engage in the destruction of "illegal" religious buildings, particularly in regions experiencing rapid religious growth or in areas with long-standing tensions between "official" and "unofficial" congregations, such as Hebei and Henan provinces       Commissions Recommendations    As stated the Commission has recommended to the U.S. President that China be once again designated as a " country of particular concern " as it relates to religious freedom. The Commission has further recommended that the U.S. government should:      ensure that efforts to promote religious freedom in China are integrated into the mechanisms of dialogue and cooperation with the Chinese government at all levels, across all departments of the U.S. government, and on all issues, including security and counter-terrorism;   urge the Chinese government to end its current crackdown on religious and spiritual groups throughout China, including harassment, surveillance, arrest, and detention of persons on account of their manifestation of religion or belief; the detention, torture, and ill-treatment of persons in prisons, labor camps, psychiatric facilities, and other places of confinement; and the coercion of individuals to renounce or condemn any religion or belief;  urge the Chinese government to change its system of laws, policies, and practices that govern religious and spiritual organizations and activities, and hold accountable violators of the right to freedom of religion and belief and the human rights of religious believers;  urge the Chinese government to respect fully the universality of the right to freedom of religion or belief and other human rights and ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;    undertake to strengthen scrutiny by international and U.S. bodies of China's human rights practices and the implementation of its international obligations;  prohibit U.S. companies doing business in China from engaging in practices that would constitute or facilitate violations of religious freedom or discrimination on the basis of religion or belief;   raise the profile of the conditions of Uighur Muslims by addressing religious freedom and human rights concerns in bilateral talks; by increasing the number of educational opportunities in the United States available to Uighurs; and by increasing radio broadcasts in the Uighur language;    endeavor to establish an official U.S. government presence, such as a consulate, in Lhasa, Tibet and Urumqi, Xinjiang, in order to monitor religious freedom and other human rights;  expand rule of law programs to include regular "dialogues" on religion and law with U.S. government representatives, academic experts, and members of the Commission with a commensurate delegation from China;   support exchanges between a diverse segment of Chinese government officials and academic experts and U.S. scholars, experts, representatives of religious communities and non-governmental organizations regarding the relationship between religion and the state, the role of religion in society, international standards relating to the right to freedom of religion and belief, and the importance and benefits of upholding human rights, including religious freedom; and   continue to promote Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy under Chinese sovereignty by: --urge the Chinese government to uphold the "one country, two systems" concept by allowing the Hong Kong people and their elected government officials to have a voice in the determination of the pace and scope of advances toward direct elections and the protection of human rights, including religious freedom; and --opposing introduction of any "national security" provision to the Basic Law that would suppress internationally recognized human rights, including the right to freedom of religion or belief and freedom of expression.       Well there are no suprises here to anyone who keeps close to what is happening in China. Once again the U.S. stands virtually alone in condemning China for a variety of Human-rights violations and has to be congratulated.   It is hoped that the continual pressure, no matter how disliked by the Chinese, is maintained and that one day the light of a brand new day will dawn upon a China in which the freedom of the peaceful pursuit of religion is allowed.

						        "The Chinese government has vowed to address human rights abuses in the country, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern claimed today.  Mr Ahern told the Dáil (Irish newspaper Ed.) Chinese   urlLink Premier Wen Jiabao  assured him his Government would engage in European Union dialogue on the issue in a constructive and meaningful way.  The Taoiseach (Prime Minister Ed.)said he raised the Chinese occupation of Tibet and the suppression of the Falun Gong spiritual movement during a two-hour meeting with Mr Wen, who is on a two-day state visit to Ireland.     It is funny that in all Wens visits in Europe that the Uygur and Xinjiang have not been mentioned, it is always Tibet.   Why is the  "Uygur Question"  so low on the world's agenda? Is it just not reported?  Is it because they do not have the profile of the Tibetans? Is it because they are Muslim? Is it because the world believes Chinese propaganda as to them being " terrorists "?  I fully support Tibet and am happy to see the Tibetan human-rights issue get as much press as possible but when there are 2 million more Uygurs experiencing exactly the same oppression as the Tibetans ( and some would say much worse) it begs the question why is their issue such a non starter?  Since the Uygur  Yinning  (Gulja) "uprising" in 1997 it has been estimated by the likes of  Amnesty International   that 124 Uygurs have been executed as a direct result of those eventful couple of days, the last only in October 2004. Many, many Uygurs languish in jails. Two high profiles ones being  urlLink Rebiya Kadeer  the Uygur businesswoman and  urlLink Tohti Tunyaz  the Uygur historian both imprisoned for "passing state secrets" Of course there have been may Tibetans executed and jailed in that time frame as well but nowhere  near the number of Uygur.

						        "China announced a campaign to weed out government officials who torture and maltreat prisoners, the latest in a string of moves apparently aimed at the United States over the abuse of Iraqi inmates. "     I resolutely promised myself that I would not be drawn into the fray that is the  Iraqi Prisoner  issue. I have my opinions, like everyone I suppose, but there is just so much a person can get his head around. If you start going off chasing  every apparent human-rights abuse in the world you would really end up a mess.  Having said that I thought China would limit herself to a knowing wink! wink! nudge! nudge! as it concerns America and the predicament she currently faces. (Some times silence can earn some chips for latter cashing at the diplomatic gming tables). But China is China and one finds it extremely hard to predict just how she will act in any given circumstance.   I have to quote  Winston Churchill  here on the Soviets because I see it just the same way with the Chinese     "I cannot forecast to you the action of Russia. It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma: but perhaps there is a key. That key is Russian national interests."     China's National interests have obviously seen an opportunity to do some serious point scoring against the U.S. over the Iraqi prisoner situation by announcing at this very opportune time how they will closely monitor "torture" as a tool used by some officials within China. They had obviously hoped to juxtapose this new found morality with the seeming lack of same on behalf of the United States.     But what a way to do it  .   Follow me here if you can as I go through a press release from the  Supreme People's Procuratorate     The Supreme People's Procuratorate said it would investigate and punish anyone who "commits crimes connected with infringement of human rights", the China Youth Daily, a leading government-controlled newspaper, reported.     That in itself is ok isn't it? The supreme legal body will investigate anyone who does such inhumane deeds. One of course would have expected that the supreme judicial body of any reasonable country would, by it's very mandate, have been doing that already but, as Winston said about Russia and which is no less true of China, she is a "riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma"  So, at this juncture and for arguments sake, let's just say the sentiment is there and all is well and fine.  We move on...  Following on with highly laudable sentiments that would do any humanitarian proud the  vice-general procurator Wang Zhenchuan   said that this campaign he was announcing     would focus on five key human rights areas including illegal detention, torture and maltreatment of prisoners, and malpractices that cause serious losses of people's lives and property.     Excellent! We are really getting some place aren't we? Crackdowns, focus on human rights and malpractices! Amnesty International could not have come up with better  Google  like keywords.  They even get to fit in their new found doctrine of  mea culpa . Just like every young boy learns at a young age when mum is looking for who ate all the biscuits (cookies): get in first and, with a look and sound of sincere contriteness, admit   " I can not tell a lie it was I who ate all the biscuits but Mum I have seen the light! "    It seems to work very well in saving some credibility forthe future.     In an unusually frank admission, the Procuratorial Daily said 1,064 cases of human rights violations by officials were carried out last year, largely illegal detention and police extorting confessions through torture. It said 66 people died or were injured in these cases, without going into details.    Again excellent! They truly seem to be learning the western art of political "spin".   Of course the numbers may be just a tad off. With a  urlLink prison population   of around 1,549,000, 1,064 cases of human rights violations seems a touch optimistic even for the best of societies. The  urlLink ">Falun Gong  group on it's own for example claim they have verified 25 deaths for March 2004 alone and believe actual deaths could be five or ten times higher.(please note some photos at this website are graphic)  Putting that  small point  aside, because numbers are always just a tad off in China, where are we to this stage of proceedings? China looking pretty?   Let's summarise  Well, China has     Said all the right things as to what they are planning to do and why   Timed the statement perfectly for maximum effect   Established that, whilst courageously and openly admitting some small blemishes in the past, they have recognised the importance of the humane and correct treatment of prisoners (which by inference the U.S has not), and  in doing so set themselves up on what some would think was unassailable high moral ground     Right ?   Wrong!   As China is wont to do time and time again they have to go and shoot themselves in the foot (thank God the EU will not sell them any bullets)   They end by going and saying something that even an "apprentice spin doctor" would never say. A clasic that no doubt will be taught in "Spin school" for years to come as how not to end a press statement of this type:          "This special movement will last  one year , and starts right now,"      One Year?

Currently there are 117 boys for every 100 girls in China -- 13 million more boys than girls under the age of nine. The Chinese have traditionally favoured boys over girls, because a man can better take care of the parents in their old age, as well as carry on the family name. This custom has led to unbridled female infanticide and the selective abortion of female children.   With a continuation of the current policy, by 2020, the gender discrepancy will be as high as 40 million more men than women.

						      Ranking high on the things I abhor most is the demeaning of a culture by way of packaging it for the consumption of the tourist market.  Australian aborigines selling "boomerangs" manufactured in China, Navajo Indians selling bows and arrows,  The list goes on.  The thought of tourists viewing a "culture" for pure hedonistic pleasure rather than to learn and to stand in awe of the history of a people is anathema to me.  So I feel a degree of sadness when I read articles such as the one I link to here.     "Other culture hotels that have been developed include the Islamic-style Silk Road Turpan Oasis Hotel in Xinjiang with its strong Uygur flavour; the Tibetan-style Silk Road Tsongkha Hotel near the Taer Monastery in Qinghai."     The article is about one Hong Kong entrepreneur a Mr Peter M.K. Wong, managing director of  North West Development Ltd , who gleefully reveals the plans his company has for Xinjiang and Tibet:     Its scope of business includes the development and management of hotels, including the development of "cultural hotels"; cultural property development; the sale and marketing of cultural products; and the operation of tour services.     It would appear that his company was behind the idea of converting the centuries old central Uygur bazaar in  urlLink Urumqi  the capital of Xinjiang and replacing it with the equivalent of a "themed" shopping mall. The renovation of the area has been universally condemned by the Uygur people as the equivalent of sacrilege against their culture. As well, the traditional users of this bazaar, small Uygur tradesman, artisans,street hawkers, farmers etc have been shunted on with numerous stories of police harassment. Our wonderful entrepreneur sees the funny side though:     A local developer was found for the project, dubbed the Erdaoqiao Cultural Region. It is now a centre of attraction in the city with Central Asia-type grand bazaars and caravanserai, albeit with Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonalds and Carrefour also present. "That's what I call cultural exchange," quips Wong.       "'That's what I call cultural exchange'" quips Wong".    That is what I call  cultural RAPE .  How demeaning to package up a culture like that of the Uygurs and Tibetans into something akin to a human zoo with performing seals and monkeys replaced by real people. A people and culture that once ruled mighty empires now reduced to a sideshow for visiting newly weds and and bussed in foreign tourists.  "Hey Mable look at Jim's and my pictures of our holiday to China, see there ...that is a real Uygur in a real  'bazaar' in Urumqi".   How very very sad.  Already the Chinese government has it's happy " Cultural groups " that it trots out at ceremonial occasions and for visiting dignitaries; Dancing Uygurs and Tibetans, Uygur acrobats et al. Now they can be taken to a 5 star  "Islamic"  designed Hotel and enjoy the "culture" of these unique peoples up live and personal  Who can wonder why the Uygur claim they are being subjected to " cultural genocide  and who says the Han Chinese are not a culturally sensitive lot?

						     For those looking for a quick overview of China's historical relationship with Tibet you can look no further tha the linked article which is a review of a new book entitled  China's Tibet Policy  by author  Dawa Norbu  .  Covering the period from the Tang dynasty (AD 618-907) to the present it deals with various eras and how successful the relationship between the two were in those eras compared to today.   The book reviewer claims that:     Most Confucian and Inner Asian societies, which historically engaged in tribute relations with China, have graduated from dependency to independence, but “Tibet alone remains one of those vanished and failed states.” (p.5) More than 40 years after establishing direct rule over Tibet, China faces a never-ending “crisis of legitimacy” with ordinary Tibetans, much more than with smaller national minorities like the Uighurs and the Mongols     I do not know if the author meant "other" smaller national minorities rather than simple "smaller nationalities" because the Uygur in China outnumber the Tibetans by about 2 million. I would also have issues with the assertion that China's "crisis of legitimacy" with the Tibetans is any more or less than the Uygur but I suppose that is a matter of personal opinion.  That aside as a quick history of the Han Chinese and Tibetan historical relationship it is a very good "5 Minute" guide.   urlLink China's Tibet Policy - www.phayul.com

						        "China's policy is to take Islam away from the children and replace it with desire – desire for wealth, desire for love in a "non-traditional" sense, and desire to assimilate into the nation as a whole." ..."desire in Xinjiang is combined with a healthy fear of prison and death at the hands of the PSB."     So says the author of the linked article about the situation of the Uyghur people on China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region particularly as it relates to laws on children and religion.  In a relatively short article the author explores the current situation of the Uygur and Islam in Xinjiang with examples from two Uygur cities  urlLink Kashgar (Kashi)  and  urlLink Hotan  (Khotan) . His descriptions are quite valid in most respects but I was at a loss to understand the analogy he attempted to draw between the Uygur and the "Black Panther" group of the United States and ergo China's and America's respective responses to both groups.  He then ends with a paragraph right out of left field and it left me wondering how we got from  Hotan  to:      America's policy is purely to conquer in the classical sense – to replace Islam with fear and submission. Both nations intend to destroy the religion and plunder the resources – but what China has in its favor is that Xinjiang lies within its borders.

						     "The Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) announces an Issues Roundtable entitled: 'Practicing Islam in Today's China: Differing Realities for the Uighurs and the Hui'     "According to government statistics, China has over 20 million Muslims, over 40,000 Islamic places of worship, and over 45,000 imams. Islam is an officially sanctioned religion, and Article 36 of the Chinese Constitution nominally ensures freedom of religious belief and 'normal religious activity' for Muslims in China. Reports regularly surface, however, of government-imposed restrictions on Muslim religious activities. According to these reports, Chinese officials censor the sermons delivered by imams, limit the ability of Muslim communities to build mosques, and discourage Muslims from wearing religious attire. Chinese government policy also prohibits teaching Islam to those under 18 years old.  The Uighurs and the Hui, China's dominant Muslim groups, have distinct ethnic, cultural, and historical backgrounds, and Chinese authorities treat the two groups differently. The Uighurs, who are of Turkic descent, face harsh religious restrictions and repression, since Chinese authorities associate the group with separatism and terrorism in western China. The Hui, who are related ethnically to the Han Chinese majority, enjoy greater freedom to practice Islam than Uighur Muslims."     So reads the intro to the terms of reference for a Congressional Roundtable on the practice of Islam in China.  Xinjiang home to the majority of  Uygur Muslims  has reportedly some 23,000 mosques, servicing not only the Uygur but the Hui, Kazakhs, Uzbeks and the other Muslim minorities, and is the predominate Muslim area in China.  As the terms of reference for the Congressional Roundtable allude there is much discrimination as to how the Uygur Muslims are treated compared to that of the other ethnic Muslim groups such as the  urlLink Hui Muslims .  One example, and one that grates hard on the Uygur, is the  general law in China forbidding those under 18 from participating in religious observance in public places of worship. The official reason given for this rule is that the youth of China should be concentrating on their secular education at that age not their religious. As freedom of religion goes this rule alone does not place China high on the scale of religious freedom, however, if it were universally enforced, one could at least accept it. This  is not the case howver.  This rule is strictly enforced with the Uygur, signs on doors are everywhere in Uygur  mosques in Xinjiang. The Hui, however,  do not seem to have this rule enforced at all by officials from the religious departments.   In conversation with Hui Muslims in China I am told that boys under 18 regularly attend services and that even  Communist Youth members openly participate. When I ask why this rule is different for the Uygur, those Hui Muslims I have spoken to  in effect shrug their shoulders and say that " the Uygur are different"  without any elaboration.  People often talk about a Muslim brotherhood but this is far from the case in Xinjiang. There is open dislike between differing ethnic groups even if when they share the same Islamic religion. An Uygur , for example, would not go to a Hui mosque and vice versa.  The Uygur are also discriminated against in the religious books they can buy and read. Islamic religious books in the Kazakh language or Chinese for example which are openly sold are banned from sale if they are in the Uygur language.  Uygur Muslims clerics are also more rigorously controlled and regulated than their Hui counterparts.  The apparent reason for this obvious example of discrimination is that the Han Chinese believe that Uygur mosques have been  traditional hotbeds of " separatist " ideology and activity and therefore represent a threat to the state. The Chinese constitution does guarantee freedom of religion but it also specifically has a rider that negates this guarantee if religious activity is  considered detrimental to the welfare of the State which obviously in the case of the Uygur they think that it does.   The Uygur on the other hand believe that these regulations and discrimination are methods utilised by the Han to erode the culture of the Uygur and speed up the process of assimilation. They claim that by rigorously enforcing the Under 18 rule, for example, that the state is attempting to break the nexus between youth, religion and Uygur culture and therefore make Uygur youth more amenable to Han influence and control.  Another area of discrimination which is quite blatant is freedom of travel to Mecca. China often cites as proof of her largess the number of Muslims that are allowed to visit Mecca each year.  As most will know the Islamic religion requires each Muslim to make one pilgimage to Mecca in their lifetime if at all possible. A visit to Mecca therefore is of great importance and significance to Muslim followers. What the Chinese Government fails to say in the recitation of the numbers of Chinese Muslims allowed to visit Mecca is the percentage which is Uygur. The fact is that it is very small indeed when compared to the relative size of the Uygur Muslim population vis a vis the other Muslim ethnic minorities.  The Uygur are relatively secular when it comes to religion. Being  Sunni Muslims  of the  urlLink Hanafi School  they are recognised as practicing the most moderate form of Islam in the Muslim world. Uygur woman do not generally practice  urlLink Hijab  prefering more western style attire and the use of alcohol whilst frowned upon is not totally denied them. Having said that however religion is as important to them as it would be for a western Christian and they deserve the right to practice it as they deem fit or, at the very least, with the same degrees of freedom afforded other Muslims in China.

						      The linked article at  China View  provides an impressive list of recent years infrastructure investment in Tibet by the Central Government.  I have to smile at the predictability of the Chinese. Whenever something hits the international press like the recent trip by the Dalai Lama to Canada and the Tibetan Hunger Strike in New York up will pop what I refer to as a " justification piece " an article such as this or a "White Paper" painting a picture of the benefits the Han Chinese bring to the likes of the Tibetans or Uygurs or whichever ethnic or religious minority happens to be in the news at the time.  There is no doubt that the Han Chinese have brought positive changes to Tibet. The Dalai Lama himself has openly acknowledged the economic benefits union with China affords Tibet.  But as many people who have spent a reasonable amount of time on this earth will attest happiness is more than just economics. It is an amalgam of many things: peace, freedoms of association and religion, freedom from fear to name but a few. Television reception is great if you can pick up something other than state run propaganda for example.   Economics however is no doubt a major component. It is hard to be truly happy, I would hazard a guess, if you and your family are starving for example. But it is much  more than just that. China is helping Tibet in regard to economics and infrastructure but does it counterbalance where Han policies negatively impact in other areas?

						       "'It is necessary to step up inspection on implementation of the Party line, relevant policies, state laws and regulations, as well as correctly deal with cases where laws are not strictly followed or not abided by.'"   urlLink Wu Guangzhen  Secretary of the  Politburo Standing Committee's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection , reportedly made this comment to party officials during a tour of  Guizhou province  this week  in what can be seen as a "toe the line" message.  It would appear that the CCP is genuinely attempting to bring greater accountability to bear upon the rank and file of CCP party membership and government officialdom through messages such as this. Combined with  the current push to make the concept  " personal responsibilty " an accepted code of practice among government employees and industry generally reinforcement of the "Rule of Law" principle among cadres can only be beneficial.  Lack of accountability, responsibility and oversight are major contributing factors in much of the corruption and abuse of power that occurs within China's officialdom. Any concerted efforts in this direction can only have positive effects upon the human rights situation within China despite the fact that the "Rule of Law" does not necessarily translate in all cases into greater fredom and protection of "human rights" as we understand them in the west.  A drive along these lines also has the effect of strengthening central government power and control especially over maverick or more liberal elements of the CCP. It is certainly another  sign of the "new" leadership wishing to assert it's leadership and consolidate it's position within the CCP.

						       "In Italy, Europe and across the globe, Chinese are courted everywhere, hoping to get a small slice of China’s 400 billon dollars in foreign investments and currency reserves. And the Chinese are amazed, too, yet fearful about such changes of fortune. Such changes represent a Copernican revolution with respect to the past, when China begged for aid and Western investment."    So said an Italian journalist on the eve of the visit of  urlLink Premier Wen Jiabao  to Italy. The author argues that Italy and Europe have to seriously re-think attitudes and policies towards China given not only China's new found economic strength but also her increasing role and influence in Asian and Central Asian affairs.   In the words of the author European views of the 'new China"    "require a deep moral examination and honest evaluation of our current industrial system.."     What I believe him to mean is that Europe does not have the experience of the United States in dealing with China and does not have in place the checks and balances  that America has.  I think this is true of many nations of the world. Dealing with China today is not only about economics, the simple “inking” of deals, it has also has to be about moral and ethical considerations and very importantly long term strategic considerations.  The article I link to gives as example small matters of corporate ethics that taken in isolation could be considered of little significance but when viewed in the overall scheme of things can be of major importance.  Such things as building into a contract with the Chinese government or Chinese companies that they must supply a worker's canteen or demanding that worker accommodation be supplied where only four people share a room not hundreds.   These things are small in themselves but can work to raise not only the quality of working conditions for those directly involved  but also raise worker expectations and ultimately conditions for all Chinese workers. Such contractual demands or requirements work to condition the Chinese government and Chinese employers to move away from their " coolie mentality " regarding the working class as very much evidenced by their treatnment of "migrant" workers.  It is ironic is it not that foreign " Capital " is being asked to act as de facto "worker's unions" for Chinese " Labour " in a Communist/Socialist state but these are some of the things that need to happen in each and every dealing with China.     From Cockiness to Threat?   I do not know if I am the only one feeling it but as I mentioned in a previous post the Chinese leadership is allowing a degree of cockiness to enter their public demeanour of late. They appear to me as if they are  feeling their muscles, testing their strength and beginning to revel in the results.  The author of the article in question must be sensing something similar when he makes comment about the recent Hong Kong democracy issue:  China’s new status makes it extremely strong. And for this very reason, international public opinion tends to overlook Hong Kong’s problems. Hong Kong's main problem now is that it will not be able to directly elect its "Chief Executive" (president) as hoped for by 2007. In a different day and age, such an announcement by Beijing would have sparked a chorus of protests around the globe. Today, however, one sees hardly a ripple in the waters of international political debate.     And therein lays the worry. It has been said by many commentators that there is a direct link between the strength of the Chinese economy and the strength of the Chinese Communist Party and that a strong CCP is not kind to either it’s people or it’s foes. Paradoxically when the CCP is feeling the most vulnerable is when it is the most “kind” to it’s people.   The recent events in Hong Kong prove just how newly confident and strong the CCP feels in the world and just how acquiescent that world has become in light of China’s ‘ Peaceful rising”  and new found economic clout.  China is feeling strong, China is feeling confident, of that there can be little doubt. Just watch and hear her leaders strut the foreign stage, see the never ending stream, nay river, of foreign countries and companies knocking on her door. Only today for example I read with some incredulity that the German Chancellor has paid five visits to China so far during his term in office.  China is also developing a list of client states throughout Asia, Central Asia, Africa and the middle east in a manner that is almost textbook Soviet style cold war diplomacy but without, at this stage, the arms supplying.  She has become an important linchpin go between with one of the member states of the “Axis of Evil” North Korea.  A confident, strong Chinese Communist Party that feels immune to what world thinks about her is really a worry for her people and, without trying to be alarmist, should be a worry for the world.  I am not advocating that we do not trade or invest, quite the contrary, but I am advocating that a) We use whatever bargaining power we have, whilst we still have it, to effect change in China particularly as it concerns human rights and, b)  that we do not allow a potential bully boy to rise in the playground and then bemoan the fact latter on.   We really have to stop thinking with our wallets and start thinking with our brains again .   Link Read Rating:       urlLink >>> AsiaNews.it

						       "Chinese Premier asks EU not to link human rights to trade "Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao told top European Union officials they are making an economic mistake to link progress in human rights to lifting a 15-year arms embargo and the official recognition of China as a market economy."    In a joint news conference with  European Commission President Romano Prodi  to wrap up a two day visit to the EU headquarters the Chinese  urlLink Premier Wen Jiabao  used the  lure of potential economic windfalls   in an attempt to have the EU divorce human rights issues from economic ones in it's decision making process.  Continuing a degree of cockiness that has crept into Chinese leaders' statements of late Wen told the news conference that   "Many countries have shown a keen interest in resolving these two issues. As to the specific benefits you will get, they are self-evident,''     Wen's current visit to Europe has as a prime objective the obtaining  of  urlLink European Union (EU)  approval of China's market economy status within the  urlLink World Trade Organisation (WTO)  and the dropping of the ban on arms trade.  The EU arms embargo was imposed after the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square.   France and Germany are pushing hard for the lifting of the embargo but hopefully it appears that the rest of the Union will not be swayed so quickly.  This year marks the 15th anniversary of  urlLink Tiananmen Square Massacre  and despite many positive changes since then in China's human rights condition, and a generational change in leadership, fundamentally the ideology that caused Tiananmen remains very much in place. To lift the arms embargo will  be nothing less than a "sell out" to the principles that brought about it's implementation in the first place and to the memory of those that died and suffered as a result of the Tiananmen massacre.

						    My primary interest, as regular readers of this blog may have gleaned, is the Uygur people of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in China’s northwest.  I “came” to the Uygur through an Internet “pen pal” friendship with a young Uygur girl from Urumqi the capital of XUAR. We started chatting and I started learning.   She did not ask much about my country, Australia, though it was obvious she knew little about it, come to think of it she did not ask very much more about me above the basics either. She was just excited I guess to be talking to a “westerner” and honing her language skills.  Now I am a reasonably educated and consider myself an informed person. I have always read  newspapers and kept up to date with what was going on in the world. Well, at least so I thought before striking up this friendship.  When I started chatting with this Uygur girl I realised I knew nothing of Uygurs, quite frankly I had never even heard of them. I had a general understanding of the history of Central Asia, but ask me whether there were Turkic peoples in China and I would have looked at you askance.  So out of respect for my new found friend I started to do some research on these “Eye- gers” (pronounced Wee-Gurrs as I was later to find out) people . Now, as a result I run a website devoted to them, am involved in cyber-activism to a degree, and I author this blog.   What I am trying to get at, in a round about way I suppose, is that whilst this blog is called China Letter it originally started life as the Uygur Letter but as you learn about the Uygur you can not help learning of the interaction of Han Chinese and Uygur in the last 2,000 odd years. In doing so you learn of the policies of the Han Chinese toward the Uygur and the consequence of them.  So, by progression, I started to learn about China to understand why the Han Chinese have done as they have done toward the Uygur. Then I learnt about general human rights conditions in China and, by what in retrospect seems a natural progression, started a blog. A blog commentating on human rights in China generally.  I recount this story merely as background because I have “come” to China quite late in life without perhaps pre conceived ideas about China or her place in the world. I had not been inculcated with any particular brand of thought from University or life’s experience. For 45 years of my life China was just China, good bad and indifferent.  So over the last year or two every morning I crank up the “news aggregator’ to see what is happening, visits some of my favourite news and opinion sites, look at the Uygur and Tibetan chatrooms and message boards and start formulating my daily thinking on this enigma China.  I have read some horrible stories and I have heard some horrific tales since I “came” to China. Death, disease, torture, imprisonment, starvation you name it in studying China you will see it. I am particularly haunted I am not afraid to say by a particular picture of a row of Uygurs kneeling in the mud in some forlorn field, hands tied behind their backs awaiting the Chinese soldiers’ bullets to the back of their heads; their faces, their eyes....  But in some strange way I can accept it all. I do not dwell on where the Chinese have been I look rather positively as to where they can go. I get excited when I hear of the announcement of some new law that is a positive for human rights and just as quickly I tear hair at some new failure some “backsliding” to use the US State department’s recent addition to Sino-terminology.  But with all this what makes me cringe the most is not the horrendous stories or pictures, shocking as they are. What makes me cringe the most, and I will have to consult the thesaurus for a word stronger than “cringe” that better describes my feelings, is to see the never ending queue of smiling diplomats of the “free world” parading in the Chinese Halls of Government, to read the self congratulatory news article about some new trade deal or whatever.   “ Free world ” politicians, “our” leaders “our” captains of industry “our “ respected public corporations walking (or grovelling it appears most time) into Beijing day in and day out as if the world has never seen it brighter. “Yes Mr president I believe in the one and indivisible China! Yes Mr premier those Uygur terrorists tsk! Tsk!. Taiwan? We support “one China” of course!”  Human Rights? Yes you are doing terribly well there! Dalai Lama ? On my life I promise I will never entertain THAT person! Now can we have that trade deal please.....?  I can see them in my minds eye now retiring to their hotel rooms or embassy apartments pulling off their ties, sipping their champagne and slapping themselves heartily on the back,  laughing about and recalling their day’s “success” whilst, in the real world, China’s people suffer so badly.  To a degree I can understand the Chinese. What they do is incredibly wrong but perhaps like a child you can somehow accept their failings to a degree in the belief that they will “grow up” and eventually take their position as a “responsible person” in an adult world. But how do you explain away the actions of the “free world”? My “free world” your “free world”? Products of enlightened education and democracy.  How do you justify their “blindness”, their avarice, their lack of sympathy or even empathy and their apparent total lack of humanity?  Surly these diplomats, these politicians, these captains of industry can see what I see? As I have related I  “came” to China by accident rather than design. I am no Rhodes Scholar or Harvard man. I have not got access to teams of experts to advise me. Why can they not see? Or do they see and choose to ignore?  This rather long winded piece was by way of introduction to an excellent article that really struck a chord with me (as you may no doubt have guessed). It is by  Bruce Gilley  a doctoral student in politics at Princeton University and the author of "China's Democratic Future: How It Will Happen and Where It Will Lead."   The paragraph that got me going is as follows       "The Bush administration should be commended for bringing the cause of democracy back into focus in its international relations in general and its China policy in particular. But it cannot lead where others will not follow. And it is the failure of the domestic and international community to take the cause of democracy in China seriously that is at present helping to sustain tyranny there. Fifteen years after the crushing of the Tiananmen movement, this is one of the great moral failures of our time."     “ But It can not lead where others will not follow ” How very true, just look at the United States’ resolution concerning China’s Human Rights violations at the recent United Nations Human Rights Conference in Geneva. The likes of Australia, New Zealand Great Britain and untold other countries wished to hell that the U.S would not even have raised it because it required them to make a decision between supporting their ally or their wallets.  " Fifteen years after the crushing of the Tiananmen movement, this is one of the great moral failures of our time."   The clarity and truth of this statement is just so obvious.      “And it is the failure of the domestic and international community to take the cause of democracy in China seriously that is at present helping to sustain tyranny there.”     Again how very true. One would have thought a self evident truth but “our” people do not seem to see it, or worse, see it and choose to ignore it.  Some other quotes from this excellent article       “...perhaps more worrying, the world appears inclined to actually support the Chinese Communist Party, rather than merely tolerate it.”    “Worrying” is not the word I would have chosen, it is more than “worrying” it is  down right scary.       “China has become an issue for economists and technocrats rather than democrats.”     A precise and concise analysis. The humanitarians and democrats seem to “have left the building” where China is concerned.   Two Reasons..    The author looks at the two much touted reasons, or excuses as he more correctly calls them, for inaction by the “free world”. One is that China's people are not interested in democracy or freedoms and the second excuse is that democracy might make China internally unstable or externally aggressive.   With regard to the second “excuse” the author states      “Changes are afoot in China in any case. Besides brute repression, the Communist Party is today propped up by urban economic growth and ugly nationalism. These are not enough to sustain it in the long term. An increasingly sophisticated and complex society will some day demand political choices, choices that the enlightened reformers in the regime will be forced to grant.     He goes on to gives a reason why the “free world” should maintain pressure and a prediction at the ultimate results if we do not.      "But foreign governments who encourage the Communists to make changes now would be helping foster a smoother and faster democratisation. By delaying reform, we raise the chances of a tumultuous popular overthrow".     Through our inaction and shortsightednesss in allowing the Chinese Communist Party to feel self satisfied with it’s position in the world, if, and when the Tumult comes it will be far uglier and far more disruptive to the world than any results of pressure we apply now. A steep cliff is easier to traverse then a sheer drop.  Gilleys’ concluding recommendations are equally succinct       “Make summitry with Chinese leaders contingent on progress in political reforms, such as an expansion of local elections or the legalisation of opposition parties. Devise disclosure standards for companies that invest in China, so they would report on their activities in encouraging worker organisation and rights awareness. Encourage universities and think-tanks to re-engage the issue of democracy in China.  Not least, engage local leaders and people - especially women - in China on the issue of democracy and rights.   This is the least we can do to stop abetting dictatorship in China”.      An excellent article.    Link Read Rating:       urlLink IHT: Let's stop abetting dictatorship in Beijing :

						        China’s northwestern region of Xinjiang has now become a hot spot for the spread of the HIV/AIDS virus, second only to Yunnan Province near the infamous Golden Triangle drug-producing region, RFA’s Uygur service reports.   At the end of 2003, there were 8,150 patients infected by HIV/AIDS virus, with 180 of showing the symptoms of full-blown AIDS. Around 98 percent of the patients infected were drug users.   The study also found that the majority of Uygurs were unaware of high infection rates within their own community and lacked access to information on how to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.

						       "With startling frequency, little boys who go outside to play here don't come back. They are snatched, spirited across China, sold and resold."    According to the linked report, in  Kunming , capital of  Yunnan province   southern China some 215 children have gone missing in the last four years at the hands, it would appear, of organised  groups that are kidnapping small boys to "demand" to satisfy customers desperate for a male heir to sustain family lineage.  The report puts this kidnapping down to two factors, one being China,'s  " one-child " policy which frustrates many couples eager to have a male heir and the other to social traditions where many Chinese apparently feel that the family tree continues only with males.  In Kunming, boys are reportedly worth $360 to $425 at "point of sale".   "Some kids have been sold 13 times" by the time they reach their ultimate buyer, the newspaper said. By then, the price can be as much as 20,000 Chinese yuan, or about $2,400".   the article states.  Apparently the local police pay little attention to this traffic in human beings reportedly because most of the victims come from migrant families, who occupy the lowest rung on China's social ladder.  "When we report this to the police, they say, `You've still got another child. Don't worry about it,'" said Jin Cuihua, who lost her 6-year-old boy on Jan. 5.    If true, and I really have no reason to doubt it given the many negatives attributed to China's "one child" policy, it is just a further  indictment of a government that allows gross mistreatment of it's migrant population which is estimated to be as large as 120 million.

						      The following disturbing though unverified news report comes via way of the excellent  urlLink Radio Free China Blog  run by Brother Barnabas.     On April 1st, 2004, Chinese police ransacked the home of Ms. Huang Zhao and her husband, stealing valuables and detaining the couple who both practice Falun Gong.  Two weeks later, Huang was dead.  Witnesses say by the second day of her detention, Huang had been severely beaten and could no longer walk. Because she refused to renounce her beliefs, on April 4th Huang was transferred to the No.1 Branch of Wuhan City Police (the local 6-10 Office) where she was tortured further.  Huang died at 3 a.m. on April 16th at the Wuhan City No. 3 Hospital.  Sources familiar with Huang's case say local police are monitoring Huang's family members and the hospital where she died to ensure information about her death is not made public. Everyone walking in and out of Huang's residential building is questioned, they say.  Huang's husband, Liu Ning, was also beaten and tortured after being detained, but he was later released to his family. When Liu visited his mother-in-law to enquire about his wife's whereabouts, he was arrested again.

						        "In the first 11 months of 2003, 30, 823 corruption and bribery cases were filed for investigation and  prosecution, a drop of 2.2 percent over the same period in 2002,  involving 33,666 suspects, according to figures released Thursday  by the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP)."    Well it does not necessarily hold true that less cases prosecuted means less corruption despite what  Zhao Dengju , deputy procurator-general of the SPP claims is "   thanks to the improvement of legal system and the nation's anti-corruption  efforts.

People like former Party secretaries of Hebei and Guizhou  provinces,  Cheng Weigao  and  Liu Fangren , former Yunnan Governor  Li Jiating , former Anhui vice-governor  Wang Huaizhong , and former  Minister of Land and Natural Resources  Tian Fengshan  perhaps thought that their positions shielded them from scrutiny.

						          "New York, May 3 - The Tibetan Youth Congress called off its indefinite hunger strike at the United Nations on May 3, 2004, following a visit by UN Assistant Secretary-General Carolyn McAskie at the hunger strike venue at 4:30 pm. She assured the hunger strikers that the relevant UN organs would follow up on the concerns expressed by the hunger strikers. "    The UN Assistant Secretary-General Carolyn McAskie's visit to the Tibetan enclave outside the U.N. building in New York and her assurances that the protester's message had been received, loud and clear at the UN was enough for the remaining two hunger strikers to end their 32 day protest.  Assistant Secretary-General Carolyn McAskie is seen above enjoying a milk drink with two remaining strikers the first food that has passed their lips since April 2 when in the company of Ms Choepal they commenced their protest to draw attention to what they considered to be the UN's lack of attention to the situation in Tibet. Ms Choepal was forced to leave the hunger strike last Friday when after collapsing she was taken to a local hospital. She was subsequently released on Monday and is reported as being in a good condition.  Originally the strikers has stated that they would continue their strike indefinitely until they were visited personally by the  U.N. General Secretary Kofi Annan  it would seem however that the visit by Assistant Secretary-General Carolyn McAskie on the personal instruction of the General Secretary was enough to satisfy their "demands".  Despite general world wide support for the hunger strikers from the Tibetan diaspora community some Tibetans felt that such an action was doomed to failure and that "hunger strikes" were not the way for Tibet to gain freedom from Chinese oppression.   Whilst stopping short of advocating violence as a means of achieving their goals some Tibetans expressed the opinion that protests such as hunger strikes are a thing of the past and stronger action is required.    The  urlLink  Dalai Lama  the Tibetan spiritual leader has publicly stated that an independent Tibet is no longer one of his objectives and that Tibet and Tibetans could gain much economically from Chinese involvement in Tibet. The objective now he  believes is to save the Tibetan culture and improve the lot of the Tibetan peoples.   This stance obviously has created a divide among Tibetans with some maintaining that a totally free Tibet is the only outcome they are willing to accept  Like the Uygurs of Xinjiang, the Tibetans must face up to the reality that the Chinese are there to stay. Strategically and economically both regions are just far to important to the Chinese state. The Tibetans goal like that of the Uygur should realistically be to strive for a degree of autonomy and self determination within the Chinese state and to try to maintain their unique cultures from fading into history.  Regardless I can not help but admiring the peaceful protest undertaken by these three Tibetans, none of whom, incidently, have ever seen their beloved "homeland". In these days of terrorist outrages and suicide bombers the "Ghandi" like demeanour and courage of these three young people was something to truly cherish.  In the scheme of things they have not achieved much but sometimes the embers need a little poke to keep them alive and for the Tibetan community and the world generally these brave people provided just that.

						        "Now, the traditional identity of the Muslims is under siege. Their historic streets are being demolished to make room for Chinese shopping malls. Their language and culture are eroding under a tide of newcomers from China's Han majority. Hundreds of mosques still survive, but they are tightly controlled and monitored. Thousands of Muslims have been arrested as suspected terrorists, and hundreds have been executed."    An excerpt from an excellent article looking at the current situation of  the Uygur of Xinjiang and particularly Kashgar and the effects of Chinese policy on their culture and religion.  As the author rightly points out that    "Here, however, Islam has collided with the ruthless methods of the world's biggest Communist state -- and the state is winning."     But it is a little unfortunate that the author puts such a major emphasise on the religious aspects of the Uygur’s plight. What is happening in Xinjiang is the death of a culture. Culture is described in dictionaries as the customs and civilisation of a particular people, religion being but one component.  It is true that the Uygur are a Muslim people and it is true that their practice of religion is being heavily oppressed by Chinese policy. But the Uygur deserve to be viewed for more than just being a Muslim people, the " restive Muslims of Xinjiang " as they are so often portrayed in the media.  Long before progressively converting to Islam between the 10th and 15th centuries the Uygur practised a variety of religions from Shamanism to Manachaeism to Buddhism. At one stage Kashgar was recognised as one of the major centres of Buddhist learning in the world and the Uygur one of the religions great champions and adherents. Christianity too has even had an influence on the culture and history of the Uygur people.  Being once a mighty empire in Central Asia, mentors to Mongol Khans and living at the hub of the "Silk Routes" linking the cultures of east and west the Uygur have absorbed a variety of influences that makes them unique among the world's Muslim peoples.  Perhaps to say that this mix of historic influences has produced a hybrid of Islam may be going a little too far but it certainly has made for a very moderate form of a religion that is known more for its extremism than its temperance, especially of late.  I think it is fair to acknowledge however that religion and language are two important determinants of any culture. To attack either or both will erode a culture and eventually destroy it. The Chinese have recognised this and the Chinese Communist government has targeted these two elements in their policy with the Uygur.    It has often been said to me, and it is something the Chinese push, that Chinese policy in Xinjiang as it concerns the Uygur is not about "cultural genocide". To a degree I would agree. What the Chinese have done in Xinjiang especially as it concerns "racial flooding" was not done with the sole reason of destroying the culture and ethnicity of the Uygur people. Too many Uygurs believe this and wrongly so. The prime motivation in promoting Han migration to Xinjiang was and is strategic. It was actively encouraged to protect China's borders. The situation in Tibet is similar with Han migration to that area, Tibet unlike Xinjiang offers no economic pot of gold. Having said that Han policy in Xinjiang toward the Uygur is chauvinistic at best and racist at worst.  The quote from the article, to wit    "The Uighur people are wild and rude," an army general explains during a flight to Xinjiang. "But in the future the Uighurs will be like the Manchus, assimilated by the Chinese, because the Chinese culture is much stronger."    is not an isolated sentiment. It is one held by a large proportion of Chinese from illiterates to educated people and one I believe has been held firmly by the powers in the CCP since their takeover of Xinjiang in 1949.  I have no doubts that it is the aim of the Chinese to assimilate the Uygur totally into the great “Han oneness”. But that is not so easy in these days of China’s opening up, in these days of the “ New China ”  They can not be as overt as they once could have been. International scrutiny is now a given and the home of the  2008 Olympics  can not afford bad press.  That is one reason that the Chinese happily enlisted in  the “ war on terrorism ” It has provided them with a perfect excuse to treat the "Muslim Uygurs" in a manner to achieve the objective that would have brought international condemnation elsewise.   Professor Colin Mackerras , a China and Xinjiang expert from Australia’s Griffith University, rightly points out that what the Chinese have visited upon the Uygurs is worse than what they have done with the Tibetans,. But the Tibetans are Buddhists and as Buddhists do not have an internationally  recognised proclivity to violence and it is harder to lump them into the terrorist basket as the Chinese have successfully done with the Uygur (though they have tried). As such the Uygur’s plight has not received the same level of international attention. We have Tibetan Hunger strikers currently in New York getting more media attention than the thousands of Uygurs imprisoned or the hundreds executed in the last seven years for political “crimes”  We have to look past religion, we have to see the people. The music, the dance, the literature, the traditions the wonderful history., the architecture, the soul. The “whole” culture.  It is not only the deprivation of religious freedom or a case of  “ Islam on the ropes ”.  The Uygur are ”on the ropes”. Their bazaars and homes are being bulldozed, their right to wear the clothes they choose and affect the look that they favour, the right to have the number of children they wish. The right to learn and read and even speak in their own language. Their traditional agriculture.  Name any aspect of their unique culture, one so highly appreciated and respected  by  the likes Gengis Khan and the Tang dynasty,  and it is under sustained attack by the Han Chinese. So far thank God and against all odds, the Uygur are holding out but for how long?  Look into the eyes of an Uygur child. Do you see a Muslim first? Do you see a terrorist in the making? Or do you just see a beautiful smiling child that has the God (be it Allah, Christ or whomever) given right to grow up in a culture that has carried his or her genes forward for two thousand plus years, through immense glory and now immense pain.  (P.S. The author mentions in the article the construction occuring outside the  Id Kah mosque in Kashgar . This renovation of the square has been completed and it is fair to point out that the result is not disliked by the Uygurs I have spoken to.)

						     Hidden among a raft of new legislation enacted on May 1 was a small but perhaps telling change to prison regulations.   According to a report of the legislative changes in Xinhuanet     "The prisoner behavior regulation has also taken effect from May.1, 2004. At the same time, the original prisoner reform behavior regulation is abolished. The new regulation focuses more on human rights protection, regulating that prisoner's clothes, ticks and quilts must be changed and washed regularly and prisoners have the right to freely choose their own hair styles, a sharp contrast with the past situation, in which male prisoners had to wear a crew cut and female prisoners ear-high bobbed hair. "    Choose your own hairstyles and bedding "regularly washed" seems small but I maintain it is a mark of a country how it treats it prisoners and old people and as we all know the former has been and  is atrocious in China.

						        "Two men responsible for the flooded coal mine accident in Wuhai City in north China' Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were detained by local police Saturday afternoon. "    Once again an illegally operated coal mine looks like claiming the lives of 15 Chinese miners. The coal mine, hiring some 60 miners, had been shut by the local government on April 28 due to its poor facility of ventilation but the owner started mining again in secret.  The accident has trapped 15 miners and rescue teams have stated that the chance of survival is thin.   The accident which occurred only the day before a  mine disaster in Shanxi Province    that has so far claimed 36 lives comes not long after the Chinese government released a report of Industrial accidents for the first quarter 2004 citing a decrease in coal mining deaths.  The problem of coal mines secretly operating after being closed for safety reasons is endemic in China so it amazes me why there would appear no effective follow up by officials confirming that closure orders are enforced. It seems it's a case of "I did my job issuing a close down order if they re-open it's not my fault"  There would appear of late a willingness of officials to take criminal action for negligence against mine owners and management which is welcomed. It is now time for the Central Government to inculcate the mining industry regulatory officialdom with the new found Chinese doctrine of "personal responsibility" for such disasters.  The Chinese coal mining industry official figures cite above 7,000 deaths per annum as a result of coal mining accidents. Expert opinion places this figure much higher, upwards of 10,000, with many accidents, fatalities and injuries being hidden from Central Government scrutiny by coal mine owners and local officials.

						       (Pictures) In a dramatic but not unexpected turn of events Tibetan hunger striker  Ms Dolma Choepel  was yesterday rushed to New York's Bellevue Hospital after collapsing at the protest site outside the United Nation building.     "Ms. Dolma Choephel, however, had to be rushed to Bellevue hospital for Emergency Medical Service (EMS) after she lost consciousness yesterday, said a report sent by Kalsang Phunstok, the President of the TYC. The other two hunger strikers, however, continue 'to be alert'. "    Ms Choephel (31) has over the last couple of days been the weakest of the three hunger strikers who have been encamped outside the UN building since April 2 protesting UN inaction over human rights abuses in Tibet.  Whilst initial reports have placed Ms Cheophel in a stable condition it is unknown whether the only female among the three will return to continue the protest.     Meantime the US State Department has joined the growing chorus of international appeal for the discontinuation of the Tibetan hunger strike. Paula Dobriansky,  US State Department's Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues , said,      "You have my personal assurance that we will continue to work in international fora, including the United Nations, with whomever will stand with us to promote human rights and other Tibetan issues".     She promised Washington's "highest priority" to Tibet when it resumes bi-lateral human rights dialogue with Beijing, and said President Bush continues to remain committed to urging China to resolve Tibetan issues through negotiations.      "Now, before you suffer serious and perhaps irreversible health problems, I strongly encourage you to assess and recognize your achievements and to discontinue the strike,".    Ms Dobriansky said in a message dated 29 April.     Link Read Rating:        urlLink Dolma Choephel under Medical Care, EP Intergroup Expresses Support - www.phayul.com :

						      I reported in the last couple of days that the Chinese Government had just released a report on industrial and workplace accidents for the first quarter 2004. In that report it was stated that mining accidents and deaths were down on the same period last year despite a sizeable increase in output.  In this report it was stated that there were no "serious" accidents in the first quarter 2004. I took umbrage to this as the report defined " serious " as being accidents involving more than 30 fatalities. In my view any death is serious and I expressed hopes that this description of "serious" was a journalistic one and not official government thinking.  That aside I commented that this result was more good luck than good management. That the mining industry was inherently malaised and that the death rate, which by official sources is around 7,000 per annum (unofficial upwards of 10,000), will only grow exponentially as China pursues it's incredible growth rate and places unbridled demands for more and more coal production to fuel it .  Well they now have got their "serious" accident with Xinhuanet reporting  34 miners killed  and two missing in an accident Friday morning in  Shanxi Province . No more detailed information is yet available.  I have made mining accidents and deaths a focus of the  China Letter   because it is the ultimate human rights violation to deny life and that is what the Chinese government is doing in the case of the mining industry.   They are totally aware of the total lack of safety controls in the non government mining sector. Many mines even operate illegally with government officials turning a blind eye either through corruption or government policy.    In 2003  urlLink Premier Wen Jiabao  called for an immediate crackdown on the industry to improve safety standards. So great and so immediate however was the fall off in output as regulations were enforced that many Chinese cities and industries faced critical energy shortfalls. In a trade off between human life and economics the government chose the latter and the "crackdown" was called off.   We have the recent case where  American Organised Labour (Trade Unions)    petitioned the U.S. government to apply sanctions against Chinese export industries under the pretence of protecting the "rights" of Chinese workers that they claimed were working under sweatshop conditions. No such calls have been made by these "altruists" on behalf of Chinese miners as China is not a great exporter of coal and thus do not threaten their jobs.  It is about time that the international community got involved in this  human rights tragedy  by either applying pressure to China to immediately take action and/or offering assistance in manpower, know-how and money to halt this slaughter.  (I would like to thank  urlLink Mine Rescue  run by Rob Mcgee for a lot of heads up information as to mining accidents in China. His site, which is an adjunct of the  United States Mine Rescue Association , reports on mining accident/rescue issues internationally.)

						     China sets up human rights hotline to catch abusing officials.   China Daily  reports that China's  urlLink Supreme Procuratorate  has established two hotlines to hear reports from the public of job- related human rights violations by officials.  Human Rights violations in this context, the report says, is defined as   ".. dereliction of duty that causes serious life and property losses, illegal detention and search of people, extorting confessions and collecting evidence by violence, sabotaging elections and infringing on civil rights of citizens, and maltreating detainees. "   The 'hotline" is intended to be another tool for use by the government in it's drive to make government officials more responsible for their actions.  Well one has to applaud the  Procuratorate  and I am sure that it is a well meaning gesture but, can you imagine some of the call conversations?   "Yes? What? Your name is Muhhamad? And your calling from where? Xinjiang? Ohh! Well, er, this is a very terrible line!  Would you, er, mind calling back some other time? Say June 2009?"  Or, what is more likely with only  two lines  available   " Thank you for calling the human rights hotline. Your call is important to us. We are experiencing heavy traffic at the moment and your call has been placed in a queue. Present indicators are that one of our helpful operators should be with you within 2,628,000 minutes. We apologise for the delay. Whilst  you are waiting please enjoy listening to the complete works of Chairman Mao"  It is not good to joke about such things but really, "two lines"?  It is unlikely such a limited service can be of real help to the many affected by Chinese official's abuse of power such as the thousands of miners forced to work in unsafe conditions and millions of migrant workers abused on a daily basis over pay and conditions.   It's only real positive is that it's existence may provide another deterrent to such activity and, along with other iniatiatives, work to slowly change the "corporate culture"  of China's bureaucracy.   urlLink "Hotlines hear human rights complaints" China Daily. 27/06/04 (Viewed 27/06/04)

						       9 people charged with plotting to burn miners bodies to avoid detection  In what has to be seen as a serious indictment of the culture of the whole Chinese mining industry 9 mine managers have been arrested on what is tantamount to a conspiracy to cover up the deaths of 11 miners.  What is most serious however is that the mine's management allegedly planned to secretly cremate the miner's bodies in an attempt to keep the tragedy from Chinese officials.  The mine's management planned to cover up the accident by reporting that the mine gas explosion on June 3 resulted in the death of only one miner and not the eleven that actually died. Then in a bizarre move they proposed to secretly cremate the bodies of the other 10 and negotiate quietly with the miner's relatives, mainly poor rural families, for a compensation payout requiring an agreement as to their silence.  The motivation for this bizarre plan was fear of the mine being investigated and closed by Chinese Mine officials and the resultant loss of income.  China's coal mining industry is officially responsible for thousands of deaths each year. In 2003 the official tally was 7,200 but many informed observers believe that this is grossly underestimated and may, through deceptions such as this, actually be upwards of 10,000 per annum.  The very fact that this mine's management would even consider such an incredible plan to deceive authorities shows the mindset and culture of an industry were workers safety and their very lives are a secondary consideration to profits and the need to supply China's ever increasing energy demands.  No-one would embark on such an outlandish and macabre plan unless such practices were rife and commonplace in the industry to a point that this mine's management expected to succeed in their ruse.  China's coal mining industry and output is of extreme importance to China. Coal fuels 75% of the nations energy requirements, demand that is growing in double figure percentages each year. On top of this in order to satisfy her agreements with the European Union China is committed to supplying a minimum export quantity of coal to Europe.  All this is expected from an industry already at capacity and where workers rights, their training and work safety levels are almost non existent.  Drawing their workers mainly from the poor, rural unemployed, Chinese private and non State owned coal mining enterprises have virtual free reign over the treatment of their workers. Where there even exists government oversight on mine safety issues it is patchy at best or susceptible to corruption at worse.  The central government whilst aware of the issues chooses to ignore them and has obviously made a conscious decision to trade off human lives for increased production to lessen the energy shortages plaguing China and to satisfy international trade agreements. In other words Beijing has implicity condoned the risks to miner's lives as a " cost of doing business "  As an aside what was the worth of these miners lives to mine management? According to Xinhuanet between 75,000 yuan (9,000 US dollars) to 144,000 yuan (17,000 US dollars) for each miner killed was offered to grieving relatives.

						     Implications for Hong Kong, Taiwan and Human Rights   A United Press International analysis suggests that China is starting to caste off it's "soft touch" approach to relations with Taiwan and Hong Kong.  Essentially, that the soft approach embodied in China's policy of "peaceful rising" has not been working and that Taiwan, for example, is moving further away from possible unification as a result.  As such, a return to a hardline approach to Taiwan would mean that China could abandon any pretence of holding up Hong Kong as a showcase to entice Taiwan to the fold. The ramifications for Hong Kong and democracy are obvious.  Whilst I do not focus on these issues as a rule I have noticed a general hardening of Beijing's posture on international relations of late. Use of flattery and cajoling as a policy tool of international relations, especially as it concerns trade, has given way  ever so slightly to a seemingly harder "take it or leave it" attitude.  In areas such as foreign countries' relations with the Dalai Lama, for example, Beijing has on occasion been downright threatening in it's diplomatic posturing. Internally the recent detention of Chinese Doctor Jiang Yanyong, the SARS hero, is certainly a thumb to world opinion as is the cancellation of a UN Torture investigators visit and the apparent increased harassment of Catholic clergy.  It has been suggested that the Chinese Communist party is re-examining it's "Peaceful Rising" strategy of international relations to the extent that some believe that it is now a dead duck. What will replace it could be rather interesting.   Link: Additional Information  Read Rating:      urlLink United Press International: "Analysis: Is China losing its soft touch?"

						      Xinjiang's Social and Humanitarian Crisis  A bronze Chinese quadripod, a replica of an ancient Chinese sacrificial vessel, was erected in Urumqi capital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in north western China on Thursday to commemorate the  International Day of Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking  to be observed today, June 26.  The quadripod is a symbolic article used in China to commemorate significant events.  The picking of Urumqi and Xinjiang by the Chinese government for the observance of this particular day is twofold.  Firstly China's first "anti-drug crusader"  Lin Zexu  (1785-1850) died in Xinjiang after being exiled there from the east in 1842. According to the Xinhua newsagency Lin seized 1,000 tons of smuggled opium from foreign merchants in 1839 and oversaw it's destruction to fight China's drug problem. His anti-drug and anti-foreigner stance later was to bring him to loggerheads with those wishing to appease foreign governments and as a result he was exiled to Xinjiang.  It is next to a statue of Lin that the quadripod has been erected and the area around it is set to become an anti-drug educational base.  The second reason one would think for choosing Xinjiang is that according to a report by  Prof. Justin Rudelson   to the  Congressional-Executive Commission on China, Uyghur Panel , June 10, 2002, Xinjiang has become the most seriously affected region in China for AIDS brought about mainly as a result of dug addiction and the consequent needle usage among Xinjiang's Uygur population.  According to the professor    "..heroin started coming into Xinjiang in 1994 from Burma. Uyghurs initially smoked it but over the past few years began injecting it, creating a nightmare AIDS crisis. Within a drastically short time, Xinjiang has emerged as China's most seriously affected region and the Uyghurs are the most affected of all of China's peoples."   According to a BBC report carried in China Study group the first case of HIV was diagnosed in Xinjiang in 1996 and by September 2003 there were 7,893 reported cases. This figure however is believed to be the tip of the iceberg with officials estimating the real figure to be between 20,000 and 60,000, and tests in government detoxification centres indicate around 70% of intravenous drug users to be HIV positive.   As stated many of Xinjiang's drug users are Uygurs and the problem is prevalent in 69 cities of 16 counties in Xinjiang. As with indigenous people supplanted by colonists in the likes of Australia and the Americas the Uygur youth  suffer high levels of unemployment and feel marginalised in an increasingly Han Xinjiang. Turning to drugs and alcohol is a means of escape from the reality of their situation.  With the culture of their people crumbling everywhere as a result of Han Government policy and faced with a rapidly changing society brought on by Han immigration and economic dislocation the normal support mechanisms of family and religious beliefs, so important to the Uygur culturally and historically, are being eroded leaving Uygur youth feeling hopeless and directionless.  Medical and psychiatric treatment facilities in Xinjiang are almost non existent and are totally inadequate to deal with the AIDS problem let alone the root problem of drug abuse and dependence from which 96% of AIDS cases are reported to be as a result of.  Drug addiction is a crime in China and for a majority of drug addicts "treatment" is limited to a sixty day stint in a  state run detox center and then release without any ongoing support. As a result, treated like criminals and thrown back into the very environment that caused their addiction in the first place many return to their old habits.  So serious is the drug, AIDS and alcohol problem among the Uygur that Prof. Justin Rudelson stated to the Congressional Committeee that the current situation has     "...brought the most devastating threat to Uyghur survival as a people".      What the problem needs is attention, funding and proper treatment of the root cause of the drug and AIDS problem but the task seems too big for the Chinese government to handle. With an estimated 6 million drug addicts in the country effective treatment is expected to cost US$1 billion dollars, an amount the Chinese government is either unable or unwilling to part with.    Putting up Chinese quadripods next to statues of Han hero's, apart from being totally insensitive to the very people most affected by the drug problem the Uygur, will not go far to alleviate this considerable social and humanitarian problem existing in Xinjiang today.         urlLink "Quadripod erected in Xinjiang as anti-drug symbol"  Xinhuanet 25/6/04 (25/6/04)    urlLink China Study Group    urlLink  Some further facts

						   Due my interest in the Uygur people of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in north western China I have developed many friendships with Uygurs living there as well as those living in diaspora.   Through the media of emails, instant messaging and the occasional old fashion post and telephone call I keep as up to date with things in Xinjiang as much as is possible.   I say "as much as possible" because knowing the situation of the Uygur in China I consciously have taken the decision that I would not allow my friendship with my Uygurs friends to place them in any danger. Accordingly I will not directly ask them questions of a political nature as I do not know for certain just how effective Chinese internet spying is.  I do know however that I and my websites are known to Beijing.   Whilst  China Letter  is automatically blocked from being viewed in China because it is hosted on  Blogspot  which has been banned  holus bolus  for some time by Chinese censors my  urlLink Uygurworld site  is also banned.  In the early days of  Uygurworld  my site was visited daily by Beijing officials of what ilk I do not know. I know this firstly because I was banned generally and could not be viewed by the general populace and secondly all the "hits" according to my traffic logs came from Beijing and were not always 'hits" from another computer browser but sometimes actual "spiders" similar I suppose to what internet search engines employ. They were by thier frequency apparently some sort of scheduled thing as if they were pre-programmed.  It could have been the censors but after banning the site what was the use? It could have been higher level Chinese officials and party members who can circumvent the blocks placed on viewing banned websites by ordinary Chinese or it could have been some Security division checking to see if the my site was transmitting  hidden "call to arms" type messages.  Regardless I must have some profile because in a twist on the usual Chinese censorship I am actually banned from viewing  Xinhua's  news website from Australia. Thankfully they must not share information because I am ok (touch wood) with China Daily, People Daily and some other English language mainland news sites.  So in knowing that I am known and in not knowing how effective they are at eavesdropping I do not ask political questions of my friends. But there are innocuous questions that can be asked to get a feel for the general climate and occasionally, without prompting, my friends will get a "feeling" across to me in an indirect way, though even this is a rarity.  But my friendships in China are not limited to the Uygur. I also have developed one strong friendship in particular with a Han fellow who lives in Shanghai but hails, co-incidently as it turns out, from Xinjiang. I say co-incidently because I can not remember exactly how we came to meet on the net and maybe it was in somehow related to my interest in Xinjiang. I do recall however that the manner of the first contact was peculiar enough at the time for me to be rather wary of what I said.  Regardless of his ethnicity, out of consideration of this mans friendship and well being, I do not initiate political conversation for the same reasons as the Uygur.  I mention all of this as background because it struck me last evening, after a late and long conversation with my Han friend, the difference between him and my Uygur friends in terms of "fear". The fear of talking about anything but the weather and the number of foreign tourists in town.  And the difference is very palpable, you can feel it being transmitted down the line.  Whereas my Uygur friends are very circumspect in what they say and will try to say something, that could even vaguely be construed as being political, in a very obtuse manner, my Han friend shows none of this reticence. Whilst he stops short of denouncing the current regime he is not adverse to being critical.   What got my train of thought working on the subject of this post was when my Han friend, who in no way could be considered a political animal, related to me a story of the persecution his parents suffered at the hands of Mao Zedong and his Cultural Revolution, persecution that ultimately forced their removal form Shanghai to Xinjiang. It was delivered with such open contempt of Mao to the extent that I suggested to him that if he kept on he might get a rather loud knock at the door to which he replied that I should not worry so much.  Juxtaposed to this I thought was an email communication with an Uygur university student in Urumqi I had over a several week period about a year ago. He contacted me initially, probably through Yahoo's personal directory where I am listed as being interested in the Uygur people. As a result we swapped stories of our lives, again, as with my other China situated friends, there was absolutely no mention of politics in any shape or form.  After several weeks of this correspondence I received an email asking whether I had given his email address out to anyone that might be "bad people" to which I assumed him to mean of "separatist" or anti Chinese inclination. When I replied in the negative he almost pleaded with me that I keep his email address confidential.   This was strange in itself but sometime later I received another email in which, almost incoherently and for no obvious reason, he talked about his love of China, how China was the motherland and that he was patriotic and loyal. Fearing something was amiss I emailed back and said to the effect that yes his love of China always shone through in his emails and that he must be a true patriot. I never heard from him again despite some follow ups. Whether someone told him of my associations with human rights activism or something more sinister I do not know suffice to say  something seriously spooked him.  Whilst obviously my "sample, being  based on limited numbers as it is, would not hold up to scientific analysis, I have personally ruled out education or economic situations as being a factor in this difference in "fear" levels.   My Han friend is university educated and part of the new Chinese  Yuppie  class. Young, upwardly mobile and displaying discretionary spending characteristics. My Uygur friends on the other hand comprise a more eclectic group and range from a non tertiary educated street tour guide (the ones that pick you up and walk you places for a modest fee) who when asked how he survives from day to day responds that "Allah provides" which I take (with no disrespect of Allah) as meaning "just", through to members of a more elite and educated class though by no means monied by eastern Chinese standards.  Without exception they all act in the same manner in communications.  I can only put the differences down to cultural and ethnic reasons and as evidence of the very real level of fear felt by the Uygur of Han government reach and authority.  Fear that is ingrained perhaps from birth as a result of the Uygurs cultural interaction with the Han or of actually witnessing China's persecution in all aspects of their life.   Actually as a result of knowing the extent of Han authority and its inherent danger to them rather than just thinking it possible.  It is like a dog which, being institutionally mistreated, harbours a fear that causes it to cower even at an innocently raised hand or voice or at an implied threat of punishment.  Whatever the reason it is an inhumane way for a person or a people to live.

						      In a world tour that would put the Rolling Stones to shame the 69 year old Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of the world's Tibetan Buddhists, is believed to be planning to travel to Central America in October of this year.  The  San Diego Tribune   quotes a member of the Mexican Tibetan community as saying that during the planned Oct 3 to Oct 8 visit, the Dalai Lama will participate in a multi-faith ceremony at the city's main cathedral which will include  Roman Catholic Cardinal Norberto Rivera  and members of the city's Jewish, Muslim and Hindu communities.  His October trip is also expected to take in Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala.   The sheer scope of the Dalai Lama's travels this year and the very positive reception he has received from both politicians and ordinary people alike is believed to be behind a concerted propaganda campaign by the Chinese government over the last two months attempting to lessen the Lama's obvious impact and show the world that Chinese involvement in Tibet has brought nothing but positives to the Tibetan people.  A sure sign of Beijing's concerns as to the Dalai Lama's influence is it's release in May of a " White Paper " on Tibet which attempted to counter the Dalai Lama's calls for increased autonomy for Tibet by demonstrating that the Tibetans already enjoy a high degree of political self determination.   "White Papers" historically are rolled out by Beijing when it feels particularly vulnerable to international scrutiny over a topic.  2004 has been a big year for the traveling Lama. Already he has had widely successful visits to the likes of Canada, Taiwan,  Great Britain and France where he was attended not only by large audiences but numerous examples of Chinese diplomatic ire. In one instance of pettiness the Chinese threatened to cancel a sister city relationship with English city Liverpool if they offcially entertained the Lama.  There has ben one setback though. Succumbing to pressure from Beijing Moscow has denied issuing a visa to the Lama for a planned Russian leg of his world tour. According to a Xinhua report Beijing is highly appreciative of Moscow's support in banning the Dalai Lama.  Meanwhile the  European Union (EU)  has placed additional pressure on China by calling for Beijing to actively pursue dialogue with the Dalai Lama and his representatives in an attempt to resolve their differences.  "In response to an outpouring of concern from European citizens about Tibet, the European Commission has issued a statement (June 15, 2004 ed.) expressing its concern regarding the situation of human rights in Tibet and also extending its support to the ongoing dialogue between Dharamsala and Beijing."

						       A new era dawns for Tibet and Tibetans As the  China Daily  points out two centuries after the  urlLink  Industrial Revolution  and the invention of the steam engine by  urlLink James Watt   a railway line has been laid on the "Roof of The World";  Tibet    "At about 11:30 am Tuesday, two 25-metre-long rails were laid at the Amdo Station, some 440 kilometres from Lhasa, at the foot of the Tanggula mountain range in Amdo County of Tibet."  The 1,142-kilometre link is scheduled to be completed in 2007 and will link Golmud City of Qinghai Province and Lhasa, capital of Tibet. At the risk of stating the obvious the rail line will be the highest above sea level in the world.  As history has proven the opening up of a rail line means rapid increases in economic activity and mobility within the area serviced. It brings wealth and people.  For some this is a good thing, for others like the American Indians in the 19th century it spelt the beginning of the end of their culture. For the  Uygur of Xinjiang  the advent of a rail to Urumqi in the early sixties and later to Kashgar brought mixed blessings. Along with an increase in economic activity and ultimately greater wealth it brought to an end the Uygurs isolation and hegemony by facilitating the movement of several million Han Chinese to the region.  It is hoped that in the case of Tibet and the Tibetans the result will be nothing but positive.    urlLink "First rail tracks laid in Tibet" China Daily 23/6/04 (viewed 24/06/04)

						    Official Chinese New Agency criticises Government Policy    In what has to be a red letter day (excuse the pun) one of China's top five news agencies the  China Daily  has criticised the government's decision to ban children from internet cafes in the upcoming summer holiday period.  Whilst showing understanding for the central government's rationale for the ban the China Daily says there are better ways to protect the young from the potential evil influences of the net whilst still giving them opportunities to take advantage of this "new" medium to broaden their horizons and knowledge.  In what has to be an understatement or perhaps a backhand criticism the China Daily "innocently" says   "A better way to protect China's youth and at the same time respect their right to Internet access is to strengthen control on the cyber content provided by public Internet outlets. It is technically feasible to use software to block pornographic or excessively violent content. "  Well I have to agree with the China Daily that in this modern time and with the wealth of technology out our fingertips there must be a way to ban certain sites from access.    I wonder if the Chinese government has cottoned on to this novel idea!!   urlLink "Blanket Internet ban not the best solution" China Daily 23/6/04 (24/6/04)

						   One name should be on the lips of every blogger, human rights activist, commentator, political analyst, diplomat and freedom espousing politician and country in the world right now. Jiang Yanyong  Why should this seventy something Beijing doctor be of such importance?   Of course his bravery should be acknowledged as the doctor who had the courage to blow the lid on China's SARS epidemic but he is not imprisoned is he? He is not sentenced to 15 years on some trumped up charge of "subversion" or trading in "state secrets"   It is true that he is not in danger of a bullet in the back of the head kneeling in the mud of some forlorn field or an injection in a mobile death chamber as a result of his expose.  His stand on Tiananmen Square was also something honorable but he is not being tortured due to that is he?  Being bashed to within an inch of his life or electrocuted with cattle prods or one of the many ways China has of breaking someone's spirit and imposing it's will.   More than likely they even have him even in a place of reasonable comfort, just keeping him out of the world's view over the time of the Tiananmen anniversary. After all they allowed him to obtain some personal effects after his disappearance to provide him some comfort.  Why then should this doctor's case be of such importance? Why should his name be on everyone's lips?  People get detained in China all the time.  Look at the "Tiananmen Mothers", some of them  were put away for a little "holiday" in the lead up to the 15th anniversary but were released unharmed after a little while.  And China is always doing it to underground priests and bishops, a swift little detention just to let everyone know who is in charge and then release. Each year around National People's Conference time and anniversaries like Tiananmen this sort of thing happens as a matter of course, barely rippling the international waters. They are not killing them after all!   The same will happen to the good doctor, he will be released back to his loving family, nothing really to worry about.  Why then should his name be on everyone's lips?   Because his detention proves without doubt that everything China does and every thing China says to the world as to how it is changing or how it has changed is nothing but a lie.   It demonstrates that everything they plead with us to understand about their "special circumstances" about not being able to "turn the ship on a dime" and how we must give them time as regards human rights is nothing but a ruse, a method of deflection, and obfuscation.  Each trade deal we have signed with them in the belief, or more to the point the self delusion, that  we are helping them change is shown to be nothing but a mockery.   As we walk away from the diplomatic or trade negotiating table slapping ourselves on the back as to what fine fellows we are the Chinese side is holding back a belly laugh. Amused at our gullibility and our self serving and selective morals.  Why? Because they can take someone as high profile as Jiang Yanyong, a person of international stature, a person that the  world knows is innocent of any wrong doing and, without one concern or fear of adverse international opinion, detain him against his will.  We in the west are shown by this detention exactly how we are viewed by the Chinese and that is that we are of no importance, of no real consequence other than as a  necessary evil with whom to trade.   Our opinions hold no sway in the Politburo halls of power. Yes the Chinese will flatter, they will cajole our leaders and captains of industry. They will nod with empathetic understanding at our concerns about human rights and promise, ad nauseum, that they are really working on making positive change but all the while they must be muttering under their breath, laughing at us for our self righteousness and the mosquito bite of discomfort we cause them.  What does this man's detention mean?   It is tantamount to a person spitting at your feet and telling you were to shove it and then laugh with malevolence in your face.   Everyone of us who have ever stood up for China is betrayed, is mocked, is laughed at for our gullibility. Everyone of us who has given China the benefit of the doubt has been proven wrong. Everyone of us who has ever pleaded with others to take a soft approach, to give China more time is shown to be a pipe-dreamer. Everyone of us who has ever signed a trade deal can no longer sleep easy in the belief that China has and is changing and that the pen handed to us was, or is not, inked in blood.   As to the advocates of free trade and lifting of arms embargos you are shown to be either gullible fools or greedy pimps.  The leopard has not changed it's spots it has just hid them behind a business suit. The torturer has not taken long overdue retirement he has just been redressed as a bon vivant.  This detention is so much more than one man having his liberty taken away from him for a short time. The name Jiang Yanyong should become a mantra upon our lips not only because of the man but as constant reminder of the real China. Not the China we continually delude ourselves we know.  We have to understand that this detention is not as a result of some local police cadre taking it upon himself to lock up a couple of poor unknown Uygurs or Tibetans or Falun Gong followers. This detention is not as a result of some unfounded belief among the lower echelons of the party that religion or ethnicity or speaking up poses threats to national security.   This is not only about the detention of a man who has committed no crime, endangered no lives.  A man who has done nothing more than exercised a right that we in the west take for granted. It is much much more than this.   Just as Tiananmen was not crushed at the whim of a tank corps commander nor was this decision taken by some lowly party official.  The decision to detain this particular man, considering who he is, has to have gone all the way to the top. All the way to President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jaibao and to all the other politburo members. Worse still, and seemingly impossible for our leaders in the west and many of us to grasp, is that this decision, more than likely, and for whatever misguided reason,  came down  from them.  They must have given approval for it. They have sat around a table, much as the politburo did when arguing over what action to take against the students in Tiananmen, and made a decision. A conscious and deliberated decision to deprive an innocent human being of his liberty. The same cold blooded and detached decision making of a Mao, a Stalin or a Hitler.  Think of it. Who else would have the authority, nay, the audacity to detain a man of such international stature and in doing so knowingly give a thinly veiled two fingered salute to the world?  These are the men that we invite to sit in the Oval Office or Number 10. These are the men we shake hands with and break bread with at diplomatic functions. These are the men that we see experienced world leaders and captains of industry fawning over and kowtowing too.  These smiling ever so gracious men, this "new generation" of leadership, these men of a million platitudes dressed in their western suits and power ties, these supposed men of the people have, with this one act, taken all of our trust, all our beliefs and all of our hopes in them and shattered them as nonchalantly as they would snub a cigarette.  The problem is that we just do not realise it yet.  No, Jiang Yanyong will not be tortured, he will not be executed and ultimately he will be returned to his family. He will have suffered some deprivations but he will get over them.  But what will not be returned, if we only realise our loss in the first place, is our innocence, our trust, and the loss of these things we should never allow ourselves to get over.  We have to stand up once and for all and say we will not be treated so. We have to say forcibly at all levels government, press and trade that we will not have our hand of friendship spat upon and defiled so blatantly and so wantonly. That we will no longer be as gullible or accepting of empty promises and vacillation.   Jiang Yanyong name should be on everyone's lips not for what he as done or even for what is being done to him, the man. He should not be lionised. As  honorable and courageous as he has been there are many who have been just as courageous and have sacrificed far greater.   But his name should be on our lips now, from every blog and newspaper, from every congress and chambers of government for what his detention should now have beyond doubt have proven to us. That, because of our hope and kindness and optimism as to the basic goodness of humanity we are allowing ourselves to be duped.   We should utter Jiang's name often as a reminder especially when the Chinese Communist Party talks of Taiwan and Hong Kong,of Xinjiang and Tibet.   A mirror has been held to our face as a result of Jiang Yanyong's detention. The question now is what will we  choose  to see reflected and how will we react?      urlLink "CHINESE ARMY DOCTOR’S DAUGHTER SLAMS HIS DETENTION" Radio Free Asia. 23/6/04 (23/06/04)

						      China torture fears hamper jail releases  The  Financial Times   reports a US official source as stating that the US has ruled out the return of 22 Uighur  prisoners held at its Guantanamo Bay detention centre to China because of fears they could be tortured or executed.  The Uygurs, natives of Xinjaing Uygur Autonomous Region in north western China, were captured in Afghanistan as part of the US intervention in that country and apparently have been cleared of any criminal wrongdoing and are free to be released. The problem apparently is that no country has of yet offered to provide them refuge.  China has an extremely poor record in the treatment of Uygurs they consider to be "terrorists", a euphenismm in reality for those Uygurs that harbour "Separatist" leanings. Since 1997 Amnestyy International claims that it has documented the execution of 124 Uygurs and the imprisonment of thousands more on various charges relating to  "terrorism" and "separatism."  Mistreatment of Uygur prisoners including torture has also been noted. As recently as October 2004 an executed Uygur had released a journal he had written documenting his horrendous treatment at the hands of the Chinese before escaping to Nepal only to be returned and executed.  urlLink (Executed Uyghur Refugee Left Torture Testimony Behind)   Several Human Rights groups have voiced concerns about the fate of the Guantanamo Uygurs if forced to return to China and it appears their pleas have been heard by US officials.    urlLink "China torture fears hamper jail releases" FT.com Home US. 22/6/04 (23/6/04)

						        Tibet and Beijing's machinations    As another part of a concerted international campaign being waged by Beijing over the last several months to assure the world that China is positively impacting on Tibet Chinese authorities announced on June 21 that they have established an organization to be called the   Association for the Protection and Development of Tibetan Culture  to promote and develop Tibetan culture.   In the last two months China has released a "White Paper" arguing that Tibet enjoys considerable autonomy, sponsored a visit to the United States by Chinese promoted Tibetan scholars as well as having rolled out numerous "advertorials", through the official news organ Xinhua, trumpeting the economic and social marvels China has been instrumental in conjuring since taking over the country in 1955.  According to a Xinhua report via Phayul.org, the Tibetan news portal, this newly formed association    "... aims to carry researches into the history, status quo and development trend of Tibetan culture, advise the government and other organizations on how to protect and develop Tibetan culture, sponsor exhibitions and symposiums on Tibetan culture in the world, and engage in international exchanges so as to enable the world to know Tibet better and raise funds for the protection of fine traditional culture in Tibet."   The preservation and promotion of Tibetan culture has been one of the main objectives of the Dalai Lama in his calls for greater autonomy for the Tibetan people within the Chinese state and is a major hoped for outcome in attempts by the Dalai Lama to open official dialogue with Beijing.  This latest move by the Chinese government together with the recent "White Paper" purporting to demonstrate that Tibetan autonomy  already exists and "justification" press releases as to the great improvements in the Tibetan economy, infrastructure and social indicators, is an attempt to effectively reduce the Dalai Lama's position to a non sequitur. In other words Beijing by its recent machinations is attempting to paint the picture of the Dalai Lama seeking an outcome that already exists and, hopefully by doing so, diminish his relevancy to the Tibet debate.  This overall strategy could be for one of two reasons. Either it could be setting the stage for a final repudiation of the Dalai Lama's overtures seeking official dialogue with Beijing over the future of Tibet or it could quite possibly be setting the stage for an olive branch to be offered the Lama without loss of face for the Chinese Communist Party.   Essentially with this latest announcement all the Dalai Lama's objectives have theoretically been met and therefore offering an olive brach to the him would not be seen as a backdown or concession from the Chinese side. The desire to save face is a vitally important consideration for the CCP and should not be overlooked.  The indicator as to which way China will jump will be whether a suggested official meeting between the Dalai Lama's representatives and Beijing mooted for October this year gets the go ahead.    urlLink China Announces Association to Promote Tibetan Culture - www.phayul.com

						     Doomed meeting gets go-ahead     According to a  Radio Free Asia (RFA)  report the government in Beijing has agreed to meet a a "non official" delegation of Tibetans as a further step in opening up dialogue between the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan government in exile and Beijing with a view to Tibet achieving a greater degree of autonomy within the Chinese state.   The main objective of the visit is to create an environment conducive to dialogue in accordance with the wishes of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, To do that we are to meet and talk with as many of the old Tibetan government officials, and Chinese as possible.   RFA reports Tibetan spokesperson  Kalon Sonam Topgyal  and former Tibetan Government in exile cabinet leader as saying when confirming the  meet to be held in Beijing and Tibet in late June or July.  RFA reports also that a second meeting which will include the  Dalai Lama's special envoy,  Lodi Gyari , is planned for October.   This current round of meetings will follow on from two held last year and are aimed at reaching agreement with the Chinese government for the self determination and autonomy of the Tibetan people. In exchange the Dalai Lama has indicated that he will renounce his role as political leader of the Tibetan people and  continue on only as spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists. Also the Tibetans would renounce once and for all any desire for total independence from the Chinese state.  The Dalai Lama has longed believed that it is in the best interests of Tibet that it remains within the Chinese state citing major improvements to the Tibetan economy. He does however desire autonomy so as Tibetans may have full control over their cultural destiny. This however is not a view held by all Tibetans particularly Tibetan youth in diaspora many who see the Lama's position as a "sell out" demanding nothing less than complete independence by whatever means.   These meetings however have little chance of success and have most probably been agreed to by Beijing to evidence it'd reasonableness over it's position on Tibet.  In a recent " White Paper " on Tibet released in May of this year the Chinese government argued that Tibetans and Tibet already enjoy considerable autonomy and could not conceivably obtain any more despite the calls from the Dalai Lama who they continue to brand a "Separatist".  As well the Dalai Lama, despite the offer to renounce his temporal role, would remain in Beijing's eyes a continuing threat to their absolute authority by not only being a living reminder to the Tibetan people of their lost independence but also due to his international prominence.  If real autonomy where ever to be given to the Tibetan people it is unlikely that it will occur within the current Dalai Lama's lifetime.      urlLink Radio Free Asia

						     Is it the translation or does it show just how badly prisoners sentenced to death in China are treated when  Xiao Yang , president of the Supreme People's Court of China has to urge all Chinese judges to respect criminals' human rights     'Judges must strictly follow legal procedures when depriving or putting limitations on criminals' rights.  Even if criminals are sentenced to death, they should not be humiliated .'  That aside senior Chinese judges have for some time now been sending the message down the line to give fairer treatment to detainees, arrested persons and convicted criminals.   Whilst stopping short of  Habeas Corpus  they have for example been urging over the last six months or so that detainees be officially charged and brought to trial within a "reasonable" period and that defense lawyers get "reasonable' access to their clients. It is not unknown for defense lawyers to meet their clients for the first time at the actually court case even for serious charges.  To be a criminal of any ilk in China is to be the lowest of the low so such attention to this class of person's  human rights perhaps is indicative of some real and positive cultural change in Chinese society.    urlLink Criminal Human rights To Be Protected Xinhuanet - English 18/6/04:: :

						   I link to an interesting but somewhat confusing article  by a Stephen Schwartz who leads in by talking about the fourth annual general meeting of the  Uyghur American Association   a Washington based Uygur diaspora group representing American based Uygurs and active in  lobbying the U.S government over the situation of the Uygur people in China.  The meeting over the June Memorial day weekend in the United States involves elections, budgets and cultural events the latter being attended by politicians supportive of the Uygur cause.  I say it is an interesting article because it sheds some more light on what China refers to as "Uygur terrorism" particularly the fact of some 22 Uygurs being caught in Afghanistan and shipped to Guantanamo Bay.   It is also interesting in that it talks about Islam in China and the apparent preference the Chinese Government has for Hui Muslims as distinct from Uygur Muslims.  What is totally confusing to me is how the author jumps from a diaspora group meeting to entitling his piece " The Coming Chinese Jihad"   Firstly as to the Uygurs and Afghanistan.  The UAA meeting was addressed by one Erkin Alptekin an Uygur now resident in Europe who is the son of a deceased hero of the Uygur independence movement Isa Alptekin. Alptekin  senior was a  minister in the short lived  Eastern Turkistan Republic  that controlled 25% of Xinjiang in the death throes period of the Nationalist government and before the Communist takeover.   Erkin junior, whom like his father has devoted his life to the Uygur cause, escaped China with his family after the Communist takeover and is presently president of the  World Uighur Congress   based in Munich which is an umbrella group comprising Uygur diaspora groups world wide.   Alptekin believes that the existence of Uygurs among the Taliban in Afghanistan was as a result of several reasons. He is reported to have said that some Uighurs were trained by the Chinese, in tandem with the Pakistanis, to fight the Russians in Afghanistan and remained after the Soviet withdrawal.  Others he claims were driven out of Xinjiang by Chinese repression whilst others were sent to Pakistan  as children to escape communist indoctrination and to learn Islam only to be driven out by the Pakistani authorities at the behest of China. These people, Alptekin was reported to have said, were natural targets for al Qaeda and Taliban recruitment.   Whilst I believe that this is certainly the case there were undoubtedly some small minority that were  voluntarily  there with the express objective of taking the independence fight to China and to think elsewise would be naive.  The UAA meeting was also addressed by the slightly discredited  urlLink Wu'er Kaixi  an Uygur student leader of the Tiananmen protest in 1989 ( I say discredited because he maintained at one time that he had witnessed scores of students shot dead around him in Tiannamen square when in fact no such shootings as he described occurred and he was later found not to have even been in the Square at the time he claimed).  Then we jump to the "Coming Jihad" and this is where it gets confusing because this bears no association with either the UAA or what was said at the meeting and as an argument rates very poorly.  The author starts out by quoting  professor Dru Gladney  a well respected expert on the Uygurs, Xinjiang and Chinese Islam talking about the influence of  urlLink Wahhabi sm, a more radical manifestation of Islam, on the Hui (pronounced whee) Muslims and China's tacit support of them.  The Hui are found all over China and are ethnically and culturally closer to the Han Chinese than the Uygurs.    Then, drawing a rather long bow, Schwartz reasons that the Government's support of the Hui, with their supposed Wahhabi leanings, and it's oppression of the sufi Uygur muslims will ultimately push both camps closer to those proponents of Islamic jihad and presto a "Chinese Jihad".  Not likely Mr Schwartz.  Anyway back to the UAA meeting Alptekin did also give some good advice  "The United States should raise the problem of the Uighurs to the same level as that of the Tibetans, and pressure China to open dialogue with all its minorities,"     urlLink FrontPage magazine.com :: The Coming Chinese Jihad by Stephen Schwartz : "The Coming Chinese Jihad By Stephen Schwartz Weekly Standard | June 17, 2004

						     Chinese Leader demonstrates humanity or political savvy?     In what must be a first for a serving Politburo member and senior government leader China's premier Wen Jaibao has visited a drug clinic in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, central China.   The clinic is one of the largest drug rehabilitation centers in the country and has 1,360 beds mainly filled with young people. All are considered criminals under Chinese law.  During the visit the Chinese Premier apparently reduced many to tears as he gave them some advice such as to remember China's historical drug problem, that they consider their parents and that they ponder their future and try to envisage a bright  drug free one.  Proving however that paternalism dies hard in the CCP Wen told the patients:   "Please keep in mind my words and the day June 10, when the premier said them to you,"   Wen has surprised many since taking office in early 2003 by demonstrating a humanitarian streak uncommon in China's leaders. This visit follows similar episodes such as when he became the first Politburo member to visit an AIDS clinic , visited flood devasteated rural areas trudging in mud and rain, went into the fields of Rural China and emphasised with poor farmers and when he personally involved himself in the plight of "migrant workers", that class of Chinese that move from their home towns in search of employment and who are often cruelly exploited by employers.  This populist approach has won Wen many admirers internationally but no doubt many detractors within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the hardliners among whom may see such acts as signs of weakness.   Whether Wen is really demonstrating by this "humane" approach a fundamental change in the new generation of Chinese leaders  or whether it is just evidence of a more modern party adopting a little western political nous and savvy is yet to be seen. Suffice to say that it can do no harm.    urlLink

						    Postponement of Torture Mission 'Disappointing' says HRIC  According to a June 16 press release by  Human Rights In China  (HRIC) China has once again canceled an inspection tour by the United Nations   Special Rapporteur on Torture, Theo Van Boven .  HRIC claims that this eleventh hour cancellation of the planned June visit is further evidence of China's strategy of immediately responding to international pressure but once the initial pressure has subsided agreements are either forgotten or conveniently postponed.  HRIC claims that this visit was first asked for by the United Nations in 1995 and initially agreed to by China but the latter has continually found excuses to cancel or "re-schedule" planned meetings.  As HRIC states in their press release admonishing the Chinese   "The PRC government has engaged in a recurring strategy of responding to international pressure and scrutiny with well-timed overtures that it and other governments can point to as indicators of China's progress in human rights reforms and willingness to cooperate with international human rights mechanisms. Once the pressure recedes, these overtures are all too often withdrawn."   This should come as no surprise to people who regularly watch China. The government employs this strategy in a variety of areas not only international relations. How many times after a major mining accident for example have we witnessed the government respond quickly by announcing new reforms or crackdowns only for all to be forgotten once the bodies are buried so to speak. Even one of the official news organs  China Daily  has on more than one occasion very respectfully reminded the government that it's follow through on policy announcements was often found wanting.  The most worrying thing about this case however is that it has to be viewed as an indictment on the efficacy of the United Nations. That almost ten years have elapsed since their initial overtures to have a Special Rapporteur  visit the country and still no result says a great deal not only about China's stalling strategies but also about UN impotence..   urlLink HRIC Inspection tour cancelled

						     There is something rather chilling about seeing a picture of two leaders of highly repressive and oppressive regimes shaking hands and smiling, cherub like, to a camera. The ever present entourage of appreciative admirers, the national flags. It always reminds me of photos of Hitler and Mussolini or Hitler and Molotov, Stalin's foreign Minister.  Recently the Presidents of two modern totalitarian and oppressive regimes met in Tashkent, Uzbekistan and had their picture taken. One a former Communist now heading up a corrupt and repressive  regime rife with nepotism and the other a current communist with similar credentials.  What was on the agenda was the usual diplomatic topics of trade and bi-lateral relations but also and not surprisingly "terrorism".   President Islam Karimov  of Uzbekistan and  President Hu Jintao  of China were caught just like this for the cameras at a joint press release recently as reported in the Xinua link..  Karimov a former Soviet shining light came to power over the newly independent Uzbekistan upon the demise of the former Soviet Union. Rather than seizing the opportunity to throw of the yoke of repression from around the neck of his newly independent country Karimov took what was a relatively benignly ruled country under the Soviets  and turned it into a personal fiefdom where religious persecution is rife and human rights violations are aplenty; where political opposition or dissent is not tolerated and where like so many before him in the history of the world he has set up a nice little arrangement riddled with nepotism and cronyism.  Basking in the patronage of the United States as a "frontline fighter" in the war on terrorism Karimov, not unlike China, has used the guise of the  ubiquitous and nebulous "War on Terror" to inflict his own brands of "state terror" on Uzbek religious, political opposition and minority groups to cement his position of power in Uzbekistan.  To hear then at the joint press release that these two have strengthened their already strong ties was something unsettling to say the least. But what was most concerning was their statement on the "war on terrorism". According to Xinhua the leaders stated that    The two countries agree that the crackdown on the terrorist force of "Eastern Turkistan" is a major part of the international anti-terrorism campaign.       "East Turkistan" terrorism is a "major part of the international anti-terrorism campaign"?  Not for them obviously the likes of  al Qaeda ,  Jemaah Islamiya  or any number of other dangerous international terrorist organisations but the little known and unidentified " Eastern Turkistan"  terrorists !   "Eastern Turkistan" is the historic name for what is now called Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in China's northwest and is home to some 9 million Uygurs a turkic Muslim people.  The Uygur people unknown to 98% of the world outside these two countries and central Asia, consider Han Chinese presence in their motherland as an "occupation" and have long held a desire to achieve "separation' though they have not backed this desire with any real concerted attempt to achieve same.  But despite almost non existent world knowledge of the Uygur or the "Uygur Question" or any real evidence of terrorist activities conducted by them these two shining lights of democracy, freedom and international peace and tranquility have specifically named the Uygur as a  major threat  to regional and world peace.  The ramifications are many not the least being that Uzbekistan has a considerable Uygur population that moved there either when the Soviets pulled out of Xinjiang in the early part of the 20th century and in doing so enticing a considerable number of Uygurs to follow suit or, more recently, to escape Chinese oppression.    Already these people are treated like pariahs by the Karimov government and such statements by these two leaders can only alienate and isolate them more and set them up for further oppression.  Karimov's motivation is all too clear. As a self serving sycophantic leader he panders to the great nations to help shore up his regime and to line his coffers.   The Chinese are more enigmatic however. Just as they appear to have an irrational precoccupation with, and even hatred for, Tibet's  Dalai Lama   so to do they have a manic obsession with the Uygurs and for all intents and purpose the non existent terrorist threat they pose.   But by keeping up this illusion of an Uygur terrorist threat they do at least keep their powder dry for when it may be needed to cover up some new crackdown or progrom against this hapless and blighted people .       urlLink :: Xinhuanet - English.

						      China certainly seems to be demonstrating that it is taking official corruption very seriously. It is reported that the former manager of the Shenzens Subway System was sentenced to life in prison on retrial for receiving bribes and official corruption.   Not only is the  sentence seen to be a very strong message to officials concerning corruption but also to those convicted  appealing their decisions. The official,  Ma Gongyuan  was originally sentenced to only 16 years for taking $3000,000 in bribes and concealing $500,000 in foreign bank accounts however on retrial this was increased to life. No reasons were given by the court for this change in sentencing.  Whilst a life sentence would appear harsh the problem of corruption is endemic in Chinese officialdom with considerable adverse ramifications for human rights of Chinese citizens. From forced evictions as a result of corrupt collusion with property developers to preventable coal mining deaths as corrupt officials look the other way to operational illegalities, corruption is a blight on China's human rights landscape.  Recently China has shown greater acknowledgement of the problem and has demonstrated a willingness to combat it resulting, as in this case, with high level officials receiving considerably lengthy custodial sentences and even capital punishment.    urlLink Boston.com / News / World / Asia / Chinese official gets life in prison :

						     State of the art technology and old fashioned weight of numbers.     I posted earlier on the jailing of a Chinese man convicted of posting "subversive" articles on the internet. I thought it might be appropriate then to dig out an old  Reporters Without Borders  report from last year as to a study undertaken to guage the extent and effectiveness of China's Internet censorship policies.   According to the study that tested government official's response to varying degrees of chatline posts ranging from the from benign to ones highly critical of Chinese policy only 30% of controversial messages made it on to the internet for any length of time.   Researchers for the group prepared and posted messages rated on a scale of one to 10 according to how provocative they were from the governments point of view and then analysed whether the posts even made it in the first instance or if they did how long they managed to stay "posted" before being deleted.   China reportedly employs some 30,000 people to censor the internet utilising state of the art technology as well as requiring internet service providers to dedicate resources to  censor their subscribers posts. Failure to comply with self censorship usually results in the service provider being taken "off the air" as was seen with some Chinese "blog"  providers earlier this year.  Further results of the survey can be found at the linked article and it goes to show that despite the enormous number of internet users in China "Big Brother" is still preetty vigilant.

						      Radio Free Asia  reports that up to 50 people have been detained by local police in the  Illi   region in Northwest  urlLink Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region  after protests as to compensation levels for some 18,000 farmers and nomadic herdsmen forced to leave their properties to accommodate a new water resorvoir and power station.  Many of those detained are reported to be  local Uygur Turkic people once the ethnic majority of Xinjiang, known by them as Eastern Turkistan.  As in all parts of China forced evictions to make way for new developments is all too common but the major problems concern a lack of reasonable notice and compensation.   Some forced evictions are as a result of corruption as greedy officials and land developers connive to make a quick "buck". There are numerous cases of these evictions turning ugly when residents refuse to leave and it is not unknown for standover men and bulldozers to be used to force compliance. As recent as early this year an elderly Uygur man was crushed to death in his  urlLink Kashgar (Kashi)  home by a bulldozer after refusing to leave.  In the current instance it would appear that the dispossessed were promised 38,000 yuan (U.S. $4,600)  as compensation for moving but  received only 880 yuan (U.S. $106) each and thus the protest outside government offices which culminated in the detentions.  The Illi region, northwest of Urumqi the capital of Xinjiang, was the scene of "riots" by Uygurs in February 1997 that had dire consequences for the Uygur people. It is claimed by Uygur sources that hundreds died and thousands were arrested during and after a demonstration by Uygur youths which was brutally crushed by local authorities and the army. Whilst officially only 8 people died according to Amnesty International over 100 Uygurs were executed as a direct result of the riot in the Illi city of  Yining  (Gulja) the last as late as October 2003.  The "riots" resulted in a huge region wide crackdown on the Uygur with martial law being introduced and severe restrictions being placed on the Uygurs freedom of religion and association.     urlLink Radio Free Asia

						     Several people have been arrested over the deaths of eleven miners who were among fifty-six miners caught when gas exploded in a coal mine in  Handan County  in north China's  Hebei Province  on June 3 of this year.  According to a report in Xinhuanet police are still hunting the deputy head of the coalmine who went missing shortly after the tragedy.  It is indicative of the culture of coal mine owners and managers in China that in an attempt to cover up the seriousness of the tragedy initial reports from the site by management was that there was only one death involved.  China's official death toll from coal mining "accidents" was 7,200 in 2003 but informed sources quote incidents such as this as pointing to a much higher real toll, upwards of 10,000, as many incidents go unreported or are covered up by local officials.  China has however shown a willingness of late to use the full extent of the law to punish those responsible for coal mining accidents whereas prior many were given nothing but light admonishment.

						     Four Years House Arrest Considered "Light Sentence"     A sentence of four years of house arrest was handed down on June 11 to  cyber-dissident  Du Daobin  by a court in Xiaogan (in the central province of Hubei) for posting  essays on the internet calling for democracy and freedom of speech.   According to Reporters Without Borders the four year sentence on the charge of posting "subversive articles " is lenient compared with the long jail terms usually imposed on cyber-dissidents in China.   It is claimed that neither Du , arrested in October 2003, or his lawyers was allowed to say a word during the 15 minutes court appearance. Du is required as part of his sentence to report weekly to the local police statement.  As  Reporters without Borders   notes in the linked article China leads the world in the number of people in jail for using the internet as a means of voicing dissent.

						        Let not this tragedy become a pretext for any crackdowns on the Uygur of Xinjiang  As with any news of acts of terror involving innocent people it is extremely sad to hear of the death of ten Chinese workers in north east Afghanistan. The death of these Chinese citizens must be deplored as a despicable and cowardly act perpetrated by small men who derive their "bravery" only from having a gun in their hands and sneaking under the cover of darkness.  It is hoped that the perpetrators can be quickly caught and brought to justice and Afghan officials are encouraged to pull out all stops to achieve this end.  It is also hoped that just because the incident occurred  close to the border Afghanistan shares with China's  Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region  that the Chinese government does not employ a "knee jerk" reaction and automatically associate this incident in any way with the Uygur people.  Let there be a full and exhaustive investigation of the incident carried out and then and only then should accusational fingers be pointed as to the suspected perpetrators.   Until such time let us be vigilant that this tragedy is not used by the Chinese government as pretext for any crackdown on the Uygurs whom they constantly refer to as having Separatist and Islamic terrorist associations despite there being very little tangible evidence as to the latter.

Two have already been found guilty and given custodial sentences whilst the third is awaiting trial. Their case came to international prominence when human rights groups and Reporters Without Borders claimed they were being falsely accused as a payback for several news articles that Beijing found embarrassing including the high profile death in custody of a young student arrested on "vagrancy" type charges and SARS coverup allegations.

						    French National Assembly Committee on Tibet presents petition to French President on Panchen Lama.     According to a report in  Students For A Free Tibet  a 120,000-signature petition on Tibet was delivered to the French president's office, calling for the release from detention of the teenaged Panchen Lama, the second-highest figure in Tibetan Buddhism.  The 11th Panchen Lama, now a 15 year old boy was kidnapped by Chinese officials two weeks after being named by the  urlLink  Dalai Lama  in 1995.  Despite international pressure for his release the Chinese government until recently has been silent as to his fate. Some believe that he may even be dead.  A recent statement from the CCP State Council denies that  Gedhun Choekyi Nyima   (pictured above) is the real 11th Panchen Lama claiming that this "living god"  actually is one  Gyaincain Norbu  dubbed by Tibetans as the " Beijing Panchen Lama " due to Beijing engineering his selection by Pro Chinese Tibetan lamas.   The Council further stated that Gedhun was alive and well and living the life of an ordinary "Chinese citizen" under the protection of the state against "kidnap" attempts by "separatist" elements.  China is fearful that the true Panchen Lama if allowed his freedom would become a rallying point for Tibetan independence groups which combined with the world stature of the Dalai Lama would constitute a force Beijing would find hard to deal with.

						       What a difference 15 years makes?  Not without some coincidence, given the time of the year, the  Peoples Daily , one of the several official Chinese news organs, carries a report on the findings of a survey conducted among 3,000 students randomly selected from universities in northeast China's  Heilongjiang Province .  Unlike perhaps 15 years ago the current crop of students reportedly are    "confident in China's political prospects and satisfied with the country's goal of building a well-off society in an all-round way."   The survey supposedly showed that "80.19 percent of the respondents said they agreed that the socialism was an inevitable option for the development of China."  It is also claimed that the    "Young people believed they lived in an era that allowed everybody to speaking their minds frankly. "(sic)  There are concerns apparently about corruption and some other matters but all in all it would appear, according to the survey at least, that Chinese students are a studious bunch and politically happy unlike their counterparts a mere decade and a half ago.  I probably am sounding a bit cynical mainly as a result of the timing of the release of this very "positive" result but I have no doubts that it is pretty much reflective of the feelings of a majority of at least the Han students.   The future must undoubtedly look rosy to them.

Then there are the happy minorities embracing communism and brotherhood with the Han liberators whose patriotic tanks had rolled into (or over depending on which side of the fence you sit) the welcoming arms of the likes of the Tibetans and Uygurs.  And don't forget the wonderful inspired and inspirational leaders. Mao has got to be the most represented human visage in the history of mankind.  It did not matter to the commissioners of such propagandist art that millions were dying in the  urlLink Great Leap Forward   or that the  urlLink Cultural Revolution  was anything but or even that it was a moot point as to how welcoming some minorities actually were. They had some propaganda to disseminate and nothing small like the truth was going to stand in their way.

						       According to  Xinhuanet  China is claiming that since the Communist takeover of Tibet (my words not Xinhua's) both income levels and lifespans have increased markedly.    Xinhua quotes the following facts obtained from the latest government statistics:     People's per capita lifespan in Tibet Autonomous Region has nearly doubled in the past 45 years, from 35.5 in 1959 to currently 67, latest government statistics unveiled."            The population of Tibet increased from 1.14 million in 1951 to 2.7 million at present, and 92 percent of the population is Tibetans.   The central government has given preferential policies for a long time to help Tibet in poverty reduction, and 393 towns of 34 counties were listed as key receptors of state poverty relief aids.   The number of people whose per capital net income was below 1,300 yuan (157 US dollars) annually, the local poverty line, has reduced to 1.07 million from 1.48 million three years ago, or down by 28 percent, according to statistics.   Per capital net income reached 1,690 yuan (204 US dollars) in 2003 in Tibet and the figure was expected to reach 1,850 yuan (223US dollars) in 2004, or up nearly 10 percent."   As with the  Uygur of Xinjiang   there is no doubt that Chinese occupation has proven positive for the health standards and income levels of the ethnic minorities under Chinese control. Having said that though the rate of improvement continues to lag behind those experienced by the Han majority.  Now if we can only add to those successes with some freedoms.

						     World ignores ongoing tragedy of China's Coal Mining industry     Why is it that the world is largely quiet, no deafeningly silent, on the ongoing tragedy of China's Coal Mining industry?   Is it because the 7,000 to 10,000 Chinese coal miners that die each year are paid to die? Is it because it is a "work related" accident that somehow makes it anymore palatable than deaths occurring from tanks being driven over innocent civilians?  On rare occasions a news agency will pick up and run with an editorial piece like that which I link to here, outlining the startling figures of death and destruction of poor, mainly rural, Chinese, sent into 300 meter deep coal mine shafts.   Othertimes the deaths of, say, 35 men drowned in a coal pit, will make a byline in some of the international papers. It is not that they do not have plenty to choose from; gas explosions, mine collapses, deadly gas leaks, flooding, slag heap collapses.   Human interest angles are also there aplenty for the intrepid journalists; families that have lost two generations of menfolk, crippled miners who will never work again subsisting on a pittance of compensation if any. Corruption galore, employment policies that "favour" poor, out of town rural uneducated laborers because their families do not demand huge compensation payouts when their loved ones die.  But even this plethora of "good" news grist does not attract the world's media to the extent that you think it would or should. But the lack of interest from the world's media is nothing as compared to the lack of interest from the world's governments and Human-Rights Groups. Why? I can't answer that, I really just do not know other than to think that because these Chinese miners die in the commission of paid labour that it is somehow ok, that it is acceptable.  The Chinese Government certainly seems to think that it is an acceptable cost of doing business. How else could they explain that in China there are 2.7 miners dying for every one million tons of output. This is compared with .03 for the United States. More Chinese miners can die from one "accident" than die in a whole year in America.  I put asterisks around "accidents" because that is a misnomer when used to describe tragic incidents in China's Coal mining industry. The dictionary definition of an accident is that it is an event without apparent cause or one that is unexpected or can not be foreseen. That does not describe the events leading to the death and  destruction in the Chinese instance.   China is aware that for each ton of coal mined to fuel it's seemingly insatiable economy people will die or be injured. They know that with each new demand for increased production (around the mid teens percentage increase each year)that it is inevitable that more deaths will occur at an exponential rate. They know that a large majority of mines do not even meet their minimalistic safety requirements, they know that thousands of mines operate illegally protected by corrupt officials or small mining towns with no other means of income. They know this but are not prepared to do anything substantial other than to mouth platitudes after each "serious' occurrence.  According to the linked article  Han Dongfang , director of the Hong Kong-based workers' rights watchdog,  China Labor Bulletin  is quoted as saying .   "In China right now the most important thing is money,"   "It is more important than the dignity of workers, than the rights of workers, the health of workers and the safety of workers."    We know why the Chinese government turns a blind eye to the tragedy, it is severely energy starved and coal mining fuels 70% of the energy demands of it's burgeoning economy but why the miners? Why do they toil many times for 12 hours per day six days a week without any entitlements that workers in the west are accustomed to as a right such as  holiday, sick pay, pensions plans workers compensation and other insurances.  Well they do receive what for many Chinese is the princely sum of  3,000 yuan (362 dollars)  a month but for many mine employment is one of the few ways they can beat China's huge rural unemployment problems. They are not unaware of the risks but are willing to take them for the good of their families and because there is no other option.   "Once my kids are out of college, I won't do this anymore. This is all for the next generation,"   the article quotes a miner  Wang  from Shanxi Province.  It is about time that this issue received the prominence it deserves from Governments, human-rights organisations, labor organisations and international mining associations of employers. Something has to be done.   Link: Additional Information  Read Rating:      urlLink Channelnewsasia.com

						         "'If you want a great leap forward, you'll get a great leap backward.'"     so says  Dai Qing   a Tiananmen protestor and now a well known reform activist,  seemingly admitting in a  Muzi  article that perhaps  the students overstepped themselves with the 1989 Tiananmen protest that went so tragically wrong. She went on to say:     "Back in those days, Wang Dan ( a student leader now living in self imposed exile) would never choose to do small things. But I don't think that just because it's small, it's not worth doing,"  she said referring to her now more moderate style of activism.  According to the article in  Muzi , and reflective of the extremely quiet lead up to this year's 15th anniversary of the student's protest that left hundreds of people dead, most participants have moved on with their lives.   Many are now successful business people or academics enjoying the fruits of China's economic rise as they settle comfortably into middle age and middle class. Some are even pillars of communist society. Even those that attempted to carry on the fight have gradually faded from the message boards and chatrooms of the internet either as a result of work and family pressures or perhaps in the belief that the cause is no longer alive.  I questioned in a recent post just how "real" was the Tiananmen protest in terms of being a universally popular movement in China at the time as it is so often touted.   Much has been made of the "millions" that supposedly were backing the student protest and  reports at the time are of hundreds of thousands  coming from all over China to join the protest in Tiananmen Square.  Also too the death toll from the intervention of the  People's Liberation Army  at the order of the Politburo is variously reported as hundreds if not thousands with emphasis on the latter.  But, at the risk of sounding "sacrilegious" to the Human-Rights movement of which I consider myself a member, what really are the facts?  The facts would appear to be that this protest that went so tragically wrong and which supposedly had the strong backing of most of the people of China virtually died alongside those killed.   There were no spontaneous demonstrations, protests or riots widespread across China upon news of the massacre as it would be reasonable to expect in light of such a supposed popular movement. Of course the put down of the Students was ruthless and barbaric and would have scared many but it did make martyrs of many people and martyrs usually inspire some people regardless of the danger, but no, there was not anything of consequence.   Most of the "remembrance" of Tiananmen comes nowadays, and has done so for sometime now, from the west not from within China. A weekend remembrance rally in Hong Kong for example drew a few thousand, most, if it were known, more concerned about their own future rather than Tiananmen.   Where are those millions of fervent supporters gone let alone those thousands who were actually involved in the protest? Apart from a few die hards they have disappeared without a trace.  You may say there is the likes of the " urlLink Tiananmen Mothers " several of whom are reportedly under a form of house arrest at the moment in the days leading up to the June 4 anniversary. But these people are not continuing the protest that caused Tiananmen, their  raison d'etre   is to remember their dead children and gain redress as to their memories not further the cause that lead directly or indirectly in their murder.    I say "directly or indirectly"  because how many people who died on that fateful day were actually not protestors but just innocent bystanders brought out into the streets of Beijing on those hot days and balmy nights to witness a "spectacle". Stories abound of people who just jumped on their bicycles to take a look and ended up victims. Innocent spectators not brave students maning the barricades and imbued with a burning ideal.  And why is it that despite the constant referral in the western press to possibly thousands dead at the hands of the PLA and police does the Tiananmen Mothers only have the names of 182 dead? (182 too many regardless).   It just does not wash that after 15 years if the casualties were as high as claimed,  that "fear" of the authorities still stops what would be many thousands of friends and relatives of these "thousands dead" from coming forward and adding names to this list, even anonymously.    Is what we really witnessed not some great swell of democratic desire on behalf of the Chinese people but primarily a group of young people, with legitimate demands, take an initial brave step to protest in Tiananmen but who, immaturely buoyed by their initial successes, took things further than it should have went?  I was interested and a little shocked in reading a  BBC  article recently about the recollections of student leader  Weur Kaixi  who before the massacre was granted a meeting, along with other student leaders, with Chinese Prime Minister and hardliner  Li Peng  . I was struck by the immaturity of how he recounts they acted. Even now he does not seem to see how such attitudes hardened the Governments resolve against the students.    He first shook hands with all of us. He then sat down and went into a long opening monologue of admonitions. To tell the truth, we immediately felt an uneasy sense of foreboding about the outcome of the meeting - This is not really dialogue and negotiation; certain political decisions have already been made beforehand!   Well, no matter whether decisions have already been made or not, we are representing the students and the pressure groups of the people to talk to the government. If the Prime Minister is adopting such a high-handed and haughty attitude towards us and is trying to put pressure on us this is not going to look good for the people.   Of course, Li Peng first said he was sorry for being late for five minutes. The reason, he said, was traffic congestion. Traffic congestion! Of course, he was implying that the student demonstration had thrown Beijing into such chaos and a state of anarchy. He was actually blaming us.   I quickly exchanged a few words with Wang Dan and decided to interrupt the Prime Minister.   I said to him: 'I am sorry Prime minister Li Peng, I have to interrupt you. You may think that you have been late for only five minutes. May I point out you have actually been late for a month, not five minutes. I am referring to the meeting we wanted for 17 April at Zhongnanhai [where China's top leaders live and work.]   And then on 22 April and in front of the Great Hall of the People we had implored you to come out and talk with us. We had called out aloud to you: 'Li Peng, come out.' We demanded a dialogue with the prime minister. Now, he is finally seeing us on the 18 May . So we are saying you have actually been late for one month.'   And then, he (Li Peng ) went on to tell us what he wanted to talked about.   But I said: 'Today we have invited you to come here and so we should decide what to talk about.'   I think such a firm expression of attitude was useful at the time in helping to create an equal status between the people's movement and the government.   By doing so we were able to create and maintain a certain pressure on the government."   With due respect to Mr Kaixi and his understandable bravado as a young man this was perhaps not the way to speak to a man as Li Ping and the creation and maintenance of "a certain amount of pressure" was an understatement. Other images of the time such as students sitting atop tanks and armed jeeps combined with attitudes such as this should, to a more mature person, have be known would be a red flag to the Communist hardliners inviting not dialogue but confrontation.  Tiananmen Square was an uncalled for massacre perpetrated by a government on it's unarmed civilians involved in non violent dissent. No amount of possible charges of "contributory negligence" on behalf of young hot headed students can excuse the government's response. It is and will remain an indictment of the Communist Party of China. It was heartless and barbaric and showed a regime bereft of morals.   However, that being said, have we in the west read too much into Tiananmen at least as to the depth of national sentiment which supposedly motivated it? Have we been guilty of perpetuating a myth for other reasons? Were those students only a group of self interested young people, albeit with real complaints who, buoyed by initial successes, carried the protest on too far with tragic results and not, as it is portrayed, the true representatives of 1 billion Chinese desperate for democratization?  I am beginning to think that yes we have.    urlLink Muzi.com | News : China's Tiananmen victims seek redress 15 years on :   urlLink "Witnessing Tiananmen: Students talks fail".

						      EU Compromise Points to higher death tolls      China and the European Union (EU) have reached agreement over the export of Coking Coal. The EU announced that a deal has been agreed whereby China will at least maintain it's 2003 export level for 2004.  China, facing incredible demand for coal and coke domestically due to the skyrocketing economy, had initially balked at honouring a coke export agreement it had with the EU. The EU as a result threatened to take action in the World Trade organization which could have been quite damaging to China especially given it's current push to have the EU's arms embargo lifted.  By caving in to the EU China has virtually signed the death warrants for many more Chinese miners as, unofficially no doubt, corners will be cut, rules ignored and safety compromised as the Government pushes the industry to the limit to milk every last tonne out it. This in an industry already over stretched trying to keep up with demand increasing a huge 19% per annum.   Despite a relatively safe start to this year in terms of the number of deaths recent tragedies have proven that the hiatus was only temporary. Last year officially some 7,200 coal miners died though several analysts believe the real figure could be upwards of 10,000.   China has proven time and time again that human life is secondary to the needs of the economy. Nowhere is this more evident than in China's coal mining industry. Despite years of promised crackdowns to increase safety levels and weed out illegal operations nothing concrete has come to fruition.    urlLink "China averts EU trade dispute" Daniel Dombey.

						       Just love the following quote from an article in China Daily looking at the  McDonalds  and  KFC  business model evolution in China.  The article talks about the initial clash of two cultures giving way to a hybrid business formula that combines the best of American business culture and Chinese food culture. It is a good little article looking at the success of these two operations in China.  What caught my eye however was this quote:    "Services offered by fast food chains express their full respect for freedom, an American value, as well as the psychological statement of Chinese open-mindedness that yearns to understand and experience the Western lifestyle. "     "...express their (fast food chains) full respect for freedom, an American value,..."  There you have it a nutshell the difference betwen the pysche of the Chinese versus the west. Freedom is an American value and, by implication, not a Chinese one obviously.

						      As June 4 rolls around the Internet and the traditional news has not been what you might call "full" of stories about that eventful day fifteen years ago. Of course the perennials have been  trotted out, the  "that time of the year" type fillers, articles and commentaries with titles such as  "Dissidents watched" and "Crackdown starts" etc, etc but given what one could assume is the importance of the day it has been preternaturally quiet.  The truth of the matter appears that, 15 years after June 4,  either memories, or at least anger, concerning the Tiananmen Square massacre has faded. I certainly have not come across anything that I would consider new analysis or that has added greatly to the debate about this historic "democracy push" in China and what it now means to the Chinese people.  Of course many do not touch the issue because they do not want to be seen as jumping on the bandwagon for reasons of personal aggrandisement. That is understandable and I admit to being reticent about posting "Tiananmen Massacre" type missives myself for that very reason. But, that phenomenon aside, is June 4 becoming a lesser issue of national importance?  Or, more to the point, was it ever?  Was Tiananmen not truly a reflection of the feelings of a nation as it has been popularly portrayed, but only that of a select group? If so has that select group, now in their "responsible years", (30+), been satisfied with China's creation of a middle class, that many have nicely slipped into, to an extent that is reflected in this anniversary's seeming lack of occasion?  It must have been more universal, what about the numbers? People may say there were hundreds of thousands involved supposedly supported by "millions". Surely that was a reflection of popular national sentiment of the time?  But is that true? Yes many did flock to Tiananmen Square in that period from April 27 through to the fatal day but how many were really just spectators? Ordinary people just curious to see this strange sight of students holding the mighty communist party to ransom, sitting atop "captured" armed jeeps and thumbing the powers that be. Just to see what causes the kowtowing to the students by the highest of the high Zhao Ziyang, party Chairman.  If there were truly millions supporting this move to democratisation where have they gone to? A massacre like this is more likely to have inspired such a large group, if it existed, than deterred it so comprehensively. Martyrdom is after all highly inspirational in such times as history can bear witness.  Some commentators have said that the protest leading up to the massacre went on far longer than was necessary, that the government had responded positively to a large number of the demonstrators' demands well before the troops were ordered in. Is this proof that the students, drunk on youthful exuberance and a sense of power, just wanted to continue their feeling a little longer thus pushing the CCP into the response that we came to see? Is the lack of "noise" now proof of that? Proof that it was just a big "party" that went terribly wrong and not some brave student led defiance deriving inspiration from the calls of the masses for democratic change?  Is Zhao Ziyang therefore not the hero he is made out be but more the villain for not exerting non fatal pressure early on to bring the protest to a peaceful close.   Is the reasons traditionally given for Tiananmen a western media/ political beat up?  My verdict is out on these rhetorical questions, all I know is that great moments of importance to millions do not go unmarked to this degree regardless of the ruthlessness of the state.

Of how, in a resort city she visited there are pictures of&nbsp;  "smiling Mao Tse-tungs, Chou En-lais and Deng Xiaopings, all telling visitors in Chinese lettering to please enjoy themselves in China."      But this new Beijing, this new China does not fool her as it does others. She rightly points out that       "It was easy in the "old days," she says, " when I first came here, to feel and see how repressive it truly was."      Something that the world seems blind to but&nbsp;Geyer&nbsp;sees     " One of the tricks of this complex new order is that the sheen and glitziness of the cities make it easy for foreigners to think everything has changed. "        "Yet underneath that seductive surface, no one seems to care too much about the old concepts of human rights"           Now the endless line of foreign dignitaries and captains of industry jostling for position to sup at the table of this emerging world economy are greeted by an illusion.&nbsp;An illusion of breathtaking change that they either actually believe goes right through the fabric of Chinese society or&nbsp;perhaps "choose" to believe it in an attempt to assuage their own consciences as they line their country's or company's pockets.     Behind this facade that is the "New China" remains the" old China." The China of cruel repression, of false imprisonment and death. As the glass skyscrapers of the new China catch and reflect the light so a person can not easily see inside so to does the new China attempt to hide itself behind the "sheen", as Geyer puts it, of modernity. But it is but glass and despite the glare it can be seen through if one wants to.     Only 15 years last month the  Tiananmen Square  massacre occurred. The world was justifiably outraged. The European Union slapped on an arms embargo the Australian prime minister of the the time even cried at the news.    Five years ago this month the persecution of the  Falun Gong  began which has according to some sources seen the deaths of up to 5,000 people and the torture and incarceration of up to 30,000. The world initially took notice but despite the persecution continuing unabated the world no longer seems to care.    Seven weeks ago China, without one skerrick of concern for international opinion, kidnapped and held incommunicado  Dr Jiang Yanyong  a man of international prominence. The world for all intents and purposes ignored it.       22 days ago the Chinese government executed an  Uygur  for "subversion" and separatist activities, the third to be executed within ten months despite not a shred of evidence that there has been one "terrorist" type incident&nbsp;carried out by&nbsp;the Uygurs since 1998.&nbsp;&nbsp;The politicians and the captains of industry response? They do not care of this death or the others.  Ten days ago the Chinese arrested  100 underground Church leaders  holding a meeting in Xinjiang. Were they plotting to overthrow the government to warrant such a heavy handed response from Beijing? No, they were meeting to discuss some strategies to convert Uygur muslims to Christianity.   We see what we want to see, we believe what we want to believe.    Magician’s tricks are truly magic if we want to believe them to be so or are &nbsp;correctly seen as just sleight of hand if we do not. In China's magic act we seem to want to choose to believe the conjuror.  We have given China the Olympics supposedly a movement that mirrors the highest and purest ideals of humanity. What have we got in return? 12 pieces of silver for selling our souls.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Link Read Rating:        urlLink Georgie Ann Geyer, "China’s Communist party governs in name only".

						   An article by  Amnesty International  and a study conducted by James Milward of the  East West Centre Washington  puts the question of claimed Uygur terrorism into perspective and I can commend both to anyone interested in the " War on Terrorism " in general and Uygur "terrorism" in particular.  Like a growing number of commentators I have long believed the "War on Terrorism" has brought more harm to the world than the evil it attempts to fight.      The "War On Terror": commendable in theory, woeful in execution, horrendous in result.    Countless trillions of dollars have been spent for an ever diminishing return on investment, some of the best minds in the world have been diverted to a cause for so little tangible positives for the world and a vast infrastructure has been put in place that serves very little purpose. People have suffered and died innocently or for no reason.  Whilst terrorism is an evil and must be confronted and destroyed wherever it raises it's ugly head we should have been careful from day one of this "war" that in the pursuit of it's objective that we did not " chuck the baby out with the bathwater ". That " collateral damage ", so prevalent in any war, was kept to a minimum.   Unfortunately our baby has definitely been sent tumbling and sliding down a stream of discarded bathwater. What final injuries it will sustain in it's tumble is yet to be fully ascertained suffice to say that it will not come out uninjured and unbruised.  The  Uygur  ethnic minority of China's  Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region  in China's northwest are a perfect example of how 9 million people have been wrongly painted with the wide brush of "terrorism" for no other reason than they happen to be Muslims and that it suited the purpose of an unscrupulous government to depict them thus.  The "War on Terrorism" as it has been conducted in it's Xinjiang "theatre of operations" with either the explicit support of the free world or at the least it's tacit approval has unfairly demonised a race of people, sent them to jails, to torture and even death.   It has assisted in the more rapid dismantling of their culture by the Chinese, it has impacted incredibly on their freedoms of religion and association.   It has helped the marginalisation of Uygur youth and added to their feelings of helplessness and lack of control over their destiny and by doing so, in no small way, become partly responsible for the Uygur youth drug problem and resultant AIDS epidemic sweeping this people.  What is unbelievable however and a mark of this great and  generally peaceful people is that they have not been radicalized by their experiences and forced into the very thing the "War" is supposed to stop.  Like a baby chucked out with the bathwater but still having nothing but love for the one hurting it so too do the Uygur remain supportive and hopeful of a "free world" that has for all intents and purposes abandoned them.

						        Born a peasant. Raised a "living god". Respected and revered by millions, hated and feared by a brutal regime. One man’s incredible 69 year journey.  Born on the 6th of June in 1935 the fourth son and fifth child to poor peasant parents  Lharma Dhondrub   was to grow up to become a focal point of a nation that was soon to undergo cataclysmic change.   Whether by spiritual intervention or just plain chance this baby boy was to grow to become a symbol of hope not only for his own people but also for many people of different races and religions around the world.  Lharma Dondrub or as he is better known today the  14th Dalai Lama , spiritual leader of the worlds Tibetan Buddhists and temporal leader in exile of Tibet, was born in  Takster northwestern Tibet  on July 6 1935.  At the age of two a vision by the  Regent of Tibet  led a team of Buddhists monks to this poor rural area where the two year old  Lharma Dondrub was identified as the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama and thus the incarnation of  Avalokitesvara, the Buddha of Compassion .  Taken with his family to  Lhasa  the capital of Tibet the young Lama was renamed   Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsong Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso , the “Holy Lord, Gentle Glory, Compassionate defender of the faith, Ocean of Wisdom”  and installed as the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists in a ceremony in February 1940.  The Dalai Lama commenced his education at the age of six and went on to complete a  Doctorate of Buddhist Philosophy  at the age of 25 in 1959.   Given his position as a "living God" his childhood was understandably a lonely one. Something of this can be garnered from what he said in latter life  that, after he granted an amnesty to prisoners upon the invasion of Tibet by the  People’s Republic of China  in 1950, he felt extremely lonely as he was no longer able to watch, from his Lhasa palace, prisoners exercising in the yard of a nearby jail. His only view then of an outside world  On November 17 1950 with 80,000 Chinese troops amassed on Tibet’s borders a 15 year old Tenzin Gyatso was rushed into assuming full temporal powers and appointed head of the Tibetan government and state.     Into Exile  On March 10 1959 increased repression of the Tibetans by the Chinese resulted in a general uprising and Lhasa erupted in riot. It was decided that the young Dalai Lama for his own safety and for the good of the Tibetan people could not fall into the hands of the Chinese so disguised as a soldier he began a 3 week trek out of Tibet into India and a life long exile.  As a result of the brutal suppression of the uprising and the Lama’s move, some 80,000 Tibetens followed him to  Dharamsala   India known as  “ little Lhasa ” where the young Lama and his entourage set up the Tibetan Government in exile and began providing for their fellow refugees.  In what was to prove prophetic upon hearing of his daring escape  Mao Zedong  is reported to have said in reference to the importance of the Lama’s escape   “in that case we have lost the battle”  In keeping with Mao’s prophecy to this day and as a direct result of the Dalai Lama's presence China never truly has won the  “battle”  for Tibet.    A Traveling Lama  In 1967 with his followers settled in Dharamsala and with a Tibetan Buddhist cultural “infrastructure” in place the  Dalai Lama began the first of his world trips to promote the cause of Tibet freedom.   His ‘jetsetting” over the ensuing 37 years would see him visit some 47 countries, many several times over, and meet thousands of prominent people including two Popes, Archbishops of Canterbury, royalty, presidents and prime ministers and world celebrities.  Initially he campaigned tirelessly for Tibet’s freedom from Chinese rule but as the years passed the realization that achieving this by other than violent means was impossible slowly dawned and in 1987 he proposed a “ Five Point Peace Plan ”  which altered significantly his stance on the Tibet issue.  The proposal called for a cessation of the transfer of large number of Han Chinese to Tibet, restoration of fundamental human rights, democratic freedoms and abandonment of China’s use of Tibet as a dumping ground for nuclear waste.  This was followed in 1988 by what has come to be called the  Strasbourg Proposal  where the “Five Point Plan” was expanded to calling for a self governing state “in association” with the Chinese. Whilst the “Strasbourg Proposal” was repudiated by the Tibetan Government in Exile in 1991 due to China’s failure to enter negotiations the basic proposal has remained the Dalai Lama’s agenda since then.   Awards and Recognition  The Dalai Lama's position of mediation and a peaceful resolution of Tibet's situation along with his general promotion of peace in the world have brought him countless awards and recognition.  In 1989 he received the   Raoul Wallengburg Congressional Human Rights Award  from the United States Congress and later that year the  Nobel Peace Prize . As well he has been the recipient of numerous honorary doctorates from Universities worldwide.  He is also actively involved with many charities for the Tibetan peoples.     The Man  The Dalai Lama lives in a small cottage in Dharamsala where when he is not touring the world he arises daily between 3.30 am and 4 am to pray and meditate before beginning his working day attending to administration duties. Each day likewise ends in prayer and meditation.  He is a tall man by Tibetan standards and rather ‘chunky’. Suffering from poor eyesight from an early age he wears  eyeglasses that have become somewhat of a trademark along with his flowing saffron robes.   His laughter, which he employs often, is deep and reverberating though sometimes sounding as a high nervous chuckle.   According to various reports he is a keen gardener and environmentalists who loves listening to the BBC in his leisure hours. Despite being treated by some inexperienced journalists as if he has just emerged  from some Buddhist cave he is an extremely astute man who suffers fools lightly especially the aforesaid journalists. Many a journalist has come away with the distinct impression of not being “liked” by him.  Despite his life’s goal of seeing Tibet again and an autonomous Tibet going unfulfilled  he remains at peace with the world and recently complained that he looks like going to his grave never having experienced the common human condition of “depression”   Relations With China     Mao’s words have proven to be one hundred percent correct. The Dalai Lama’s freedom has been a constant thorn in the side of China’s claim of legitimacy of their rule over Tibet.  Even today despite the passing of some 45 years since the dalai Lama’s  escape from Tibet and despite his public position of acceptance of Chinese rule, albeit with riders as to Tibet self determination, the Chinese Government pursue him with an almost  maniacal obsession.  Continually  denouncing him as a “separatist” despite his stated conciliatory position, maintaining constant media propaganda in an attempt to counter his growing influence and badgering, bribing and threatening  foreign governments over his visits to their countries, the Chinese government display symptoms of extreme paranoia.  The Lama himself has even said that he owes much of his “celebrity” to the Chinese themselves.  If they had only forgotten about him, he said, so would have the world  Does he hate China for what it has done to his people and himself? The deaths of some 1 million Tibetans and the  rape of their culture? The answer is no. In 1996 he was quoted by Asia Week as saying with a touch of his wry humor   “I pray for Tibet everyday. But I also pray for China. I’m optimistic. Of course I have been optimistic for 37 years now.”     Importance  The Dalai Lama favorite saying is that he is “just a simple monk - nothing more and nothing less” but the reality is something very different..  The “ Jewel ”, as the Tibetan people call him, is revered by his people in Tibet.   Whilst it is a criminal offence to have a photo of the Dalai Lama in Tibet many risk jail by doing so. Western tourists apparently are stopped numerous times in Tibet and asked whether they have his picture by adoring Tibetan followers longing to see his image.  So great is his effect on the people that there are numerous reports of simple Tibetans collapsing in his presence overcome by raw emotion at meeting him.  The Lama jokes that the Tibetan people only love him because they never have had to be directly ruled by him but it is far greater than that.  As long as he lives he is the embodiment of their culture, their history, their religion and their hope in a better tomorrow. He is their leader who bravely at the age of 19 traveled to Peking to meet face to face with Mao Zedong and Chou En Lai to plead for his people.   He is the person who has championed their cause to a wider world that would have long forgotten them by now if not for him  Despite this obvious  love of him not all Tibetans universally support him however. There are many, especially among  young Tibetans in Diaspora who have never seen their motherland, who are at odds with his stance of peaceful resolution of differences between China and Tibet and his acceptance of Chinese rule.  With the hot bloodedness of youth and the lack of actual experience of the reality that is modern day Tibet they call for the use of violence to overcome Chinese rule, a position that The Dalai lama will not countenance   The Lama has far transcended his role as just the spiritual leader of  a small number of people practicing an arcane religion in a remote part of the world to become increasingly of far wider importance to many people worldwide  His history, his promotion of peace and his message of a tranquil life in a world increasingly numbed by brutality has drawn a wider group of supporters who see the Lama as being something pure and simple in an non pure and complicated world.  His acceptance of other faiths and his not being seen as a “recruiter”  for  Buddhism is also respected.  He said at the  World Congress of Faith  in London in 1981   “I always believe that it is much better to have a variety of religions, a variety of philosophies rather than a single religion or philosophy. This is necessary because of the different mental dispositions of each human being. Each religion has certain unique ideas or techniques and learning about them can only enrich one’s own faith”  He also counsels people from not seeking Buddhism as a panacea but rather to use Buddhist techniques to better practice their own religions. At every event he is involved in organizing he asks for at least one inter-faith event to be held coincident with his own  The measure of his growing relevancy to a non Buddhist world can be seen in his  is  2004 world trips where at every occasion he is being greeted by more and more people willing to pay between $20 and $100 to hear him speak.   Only recently an appearance planned for later this year at Florida University has to be moved to a stadium to accommodate some 13,000 “fans”. A trip to Canada earlier in the year witnessed similar phenomena as people came from as far away as the United States to hear him speak and larger venues had to be found to accommodate them.      The Future  Much speculation abounds as to what will become of the Tibet issue and Tibetan Buddhism when the Dalai Lama dies. The Lama himself has indicated that the decision as to whether the position of Dalai lama continues is entirely up to the Tibetan people. It is unlikely someone like him, moulded as he was by exceptional circumstances can be found again.  He has said though, in obvious counter to any attempts by the Chinese upon his death to install a puppet Dalai Lama as they have attempted to do with the position of  Panchen Lama ,  that any reincarnation of him will not be found under Chinese control.  As he has escaped communist rule so has the spirit of the Buddha and by inference the spirit of the Tibetan people.   Happy Birthday Dalai Lama your position in the history of the world is assured

						     The  Dalai Lama  leader of Tibetan Buddhists has been forced to cancel a planned visit to Spain due to health concerns.  The Dalai Lama was due in Barcelona Spain to celebrate his birthday on July 6 as well as to meet local Buddhists and admirers.   Phayul.com  the Tibetan diaspora newspaper reports that his Holiness has been ordered by doctors to take two weeks rest from what has been a punishing travel itinerary this year in an attempt to shake off a persistent cough.  The Lama, 69 on July 6, has been constantly on the move this year visiting the likes of Canada, the United Kingdom, France and Taiwan where he has been met by considerable success for his political and spiritual agendas much to the chagrin of Beijing.   The Chinese communist government has embarked on an all out "anti Lama" propaganda war this year in an attempt to counter the Lama's growing celebrity and popularity. A "White paper" China's  highest level tool to persuade international opinion was released on the  Tibet situation in May and addressed issues relating to the Dalai Lama and his calls for greater autonomy for the Tibetan people. As well the Chinese has maintained constant diplomatic pressure on host countries resulting in one country at least, Russia, denying the Lama a visa to visit.  The Dalai Lama has confirmed engagements still to be fulfilled in the United States and Central America. According to the Miami Herald he will speak at two venues in Florida in September.  One event had to be rescheduled to a stadium to accommodate an audience of 13,000 people. The Miami Herald further reports that the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet will give an address titled  "World peace through inner peace."   Tickets for the Florida event range from US$22 to US$90 prices that certainly place the Dalai Lama into the "star" category.  He is due in central America in October      urlLink "Dalai Lama cancels Spain visit for health reasons".www.phayul.com July 3 2004 (Viewed July 4 2004)    urlLink AAP."Dalai Lama to speak in South Florida this fall" The Miami Herald July 3 2004 (viewed July 5)

						      Gender imbalance woes in China blamed on modern technology  A report recently in China's  People's Daily  looks at the growing gender imbalance in China and claims that it is as a direct result of modern technology which allows parents to find out the sex of an unborn child and then terminate the pregnancy if the child is a female.  According to the report the  National Population and Family Planning Commission   has focussed on the gender issue as posing a serious problem for China but in doing so incorrectly infers modern technology as being at fault ignoring the possibility that the policy itself may be to blame.   A Serious Problem   China faces some serious population issues in the next 40 years. Gender imbalance is the major one having potential consequences never before faced by a civilized society. The other is a consequent age imbalance, which in itself poses daunting social and economic questions for the Chinese government.  Faced with an exploding population and an economic system that could not support it the Chinese Communist party took the unprecedented step in 1979 of implementing a policy of population control which came to be known as China's " One Child Policy "   The policy effectively was introduced to stop a whole generation of Chinese children from being born and in doing so attempt to  "buy" some time to allow the government to implement wide ranging economic reforms to position the country so that it could essentially feed itself into the future.  The "One Child Policy" whilst never a law was promoted through propaganda,  "carrot and stick" incentives and in some instances by over zealous officials who took the 'spirit' too far resulting in numerous horror stories of harassment, forced abortions and sterilization of women.  However implemented it has been an astounding success. The Total Replacement Fertility Rate (TFR) in 1979 was 3.6 this had been brought down to 1.8 by 2000.  Effectively meaning that some 250 million Chinese children were stopped from being borne.  But like any medicine to cure an ailment China's” One Child” initiative has had it's side effects.  A major adverse effect of the policy has been an unnatural skewing of the gender balance of Chinese society to a point that sees a ratio of 117:100 male to female births as compared to a world average of 104-107:100 males to females.  Historically China has valued male children over female mainly for economic reasons. Boys were considered more productive especially in the poorer rural areas and were also seen as a "superannuation" investment for Chinese parents. As well, culturally, China also has always been a patriarchal society where males dominate the social system.  China's "One Child" Policy combined with this historical perspective and modern technology which allows identification and selective termination of female fetuses has meant that gender imbalance in China's population has become a very major problem. A problem that can only be guessed at as to its social ramifications having as it does no historic parallel against which to compare.  Problems hinted at as to what will be the result of too many men for too few women range from medical and psychological problems through to economic and social concerns. The prospect of 2020 with an estimated 40 million Chinese males denied the opportunity of a settled married and family life with all its attendant positives for society generally is uncharted territory.  The other drawback of the "One Child” Policy is the artificial skewing of the age balance of Chinese society. We are now witnessing a second generation of Chinese that will have a negative fertility rate. In other words it is not regenerating itself. The result of this combined with increasing life expectancy is that the population will become increasingly aged.   After 2015, China's population structure will experience marked changes and the working-age population will not be as abundant as today. By  2020, old-age population will surge and by 2040, China's total old-age population (65+) will hit 397 million, exceeding many countries' current population. By 2050, the number of very old people those above 80 will top 100 million  Obviously a rise in aged means that working people i.e. those people between 15-59 years old, will decline proportionately. In 2000 China's working population accounted for 64.66 per cent in the total population; the figure will drop to 53.42 per cent by 2050."   Will the Gamble Succeed?   The ramifications are a plenty and must be quite concerning to government planners. How is the social security system to be structured and funded? What are the health care delivery and aged care considerations? How does relatively fewer workers support the economy and the high number of “non-productives”? Obviously through greater productivity but how is this attained and at what cost? Quantity will have to be replaced with quality but how?  The "One Child " Policy of the CCP has been an overwhelming and unprecedented social experiment which has had striking success within a narrow band of objectives.  The question remains to be answered however is whether the negatives will outweigh the positives.   Has China been successful in "buying" itself enough time to effect social and economic structural change so as it can insure that it is able to  "feed" itself or has it only succeeded in deferring the problem by 50 years?    urlLink Imbalance gender ratio a worry of China" People's Daily Daily. 30 June 2004 (Viewed 1 July)
