      I leave today so, *snif*, this could be my last post for a whole eleven days. I could maybe possibly find a computer once I reach Drayton (stop number one on the relative trek) as those are the only ones we'll be visiting who have seen technology and rejoiced. I doubt the rest of them could turn on a computer let alone use one. But if we don't actually see them at their house or their computer is sick or  something , I probably won't be able to update my charming wee site for a while.   Parents are out now. They get home in an hour and a half. By the time they get home I have to have cleaned the bathroom, washed my sheets and packed my carry on. I also want to e-mail Susie the little bit of editing I have gotten done (which is like almost a page) in case I don't get a chance to do more. But hopefully the mother will insist we all "nap" in which case I'll get some more done. We did the rest of the packing last night, and it was more pleasant than is usually the case. She didn't grow horns or scales and seemed really rather pleasant. Weird.   I am kinda mouring the loss of the book I'm reading. Pillars of Creations is Susie's book so I can't bring it with me for fear of wrath. I'm about a hundred pages in and have to leave it for more than a week. I hate leaving books without finishing them. At the report card thing yesterday I got two more books to read. Yes, I got homework for over the summer. It's for my English AP class. I get to read 1984 and Wuthering Heights. I read 1984 last summer so a re-read will be easy. Wuthering Heights I read in grade 7 so, surprise suprise, it was a tad above my reading level. Emily Bonte just wasn't computing to twelve year old me. Still though, I have an introduction to it. The teacher had told me we'd get the Great Gapsy. I'm more pleased with these.   Wanna know my marks? Okee. AP psych B81%, Acting A93%, Foods A91%, CAPP A90%, Math C+72% (73 is a B... grr), History A89%, French B83%, Media A86%, Lit A92%. This lit and history are actually only 60 per cent of my final as the mark can't be calculated until my provincial has been marked. We got year books too but not many people signed mine 'cause I had to go volunteer at the hospital.  Volunteering was nice. I spent most of my time with Helen the deaf dwarf. She's really nice. It is actually quite tragic. All that any of those people want is to go home - but most never will. They are in that ward because they are on a waiting list to get into a nursing home. People keep asking me to call a cab so they can get home... but they can't and maybe never will. Poor people!  I should go do all that stuff I have to do before my parents come back. I'll post again as soon as I can!! Buh-bye!

      Susie is asleep right now. How do I know this? She's in my bed. She came over yesterday so we could hand out once more before I go to Ontario tommorrow. She decided not to leave. Not terribly peculier actually. Poor Susie was recently complaining that she has no readers on her blog and hasn't even gotten a single coment (we don't comment on eachothers as we'll just discuss them later anyways) and she's had hers about three days less than I've had mine. So here's my shameless ad for  urlLink Susie's blog . She should be pleased.  We have to go to school today to pick up our report cards and annuals. I have to leave there post haste though because I have to get to the hospital for volunteer day number two. That means I wont be able to get many of the grade 12s to sign it.   Susie got the editting to me. Well, most of it. She still has about a page to do. I read it last night and it was very good. Now I get to commmence on editting chapters 15 and 16 but as I am off to Ottawa tommorrow I'll be able to get  very  little completed. I'll do as much as I can and get it back to her. She'll get a double dose of editting but at least some can get done while I'm away.   Susie is awake. I'll go... um... feed her, or something.

      I have 100% all natural colora hair henna on my head right now supposedly giving me a "chestnut shine". It also means I clothed in two shower caps and a garbage bag. This stuff is like baby diarreah green and smells like a sulphurous swamp of dying vegitagtation. Uuugh.   Big bad history test tommorrow. Uuugh again. I expect about 83 percent or so. I hope for better. Really I do.   We're gonna have to be half naked in Ontario. We filled an ENTIRE large suitcase and still not done. We can only bring one more smaller suitcase as that's all that will fit in the rental car in Toronto. So four of us have to fit clothes for 10 days in half a medium sized suitcase.   Being glared at by an impatient mother. Must go wash hair.

      heh heh heh... rant much? Sorry 'bout that. Today I get "sheared" because my mother didn't want to "have to look at that mess" for the rest of the summer becuase I "look like her older sister" rather than her daughter. Ain't it sweet? It's really just a trim but they are going to "shape my face" apparently... whatever that means. Its a friggin hairdresser, not a plastic surgeon! Maybe I'll try something more exciting come September.  Tragically, our dining room table sufferred a fatal wound last night and is now wxpected to pass away. Well actually it is just covered in all the christmas preasents for people in Ontario. There are practically enought there for all the people of the province, not just my relatives. This makes my mom grumpy as familly dinners are necessary for a productive family and eating in the living room in front of the tv or in our respective bedrooms is simply unexceptable - those preasents are breaking apart the family unit as we speak! Two nights i a row we haven't eaten together dear god!  I have to study history today. 1917-1991. Joy o' joys. Stupid provincial exam... I didn't mind studying for lit 'cause I liked that stuff. Histroy is BORING. I don't care about the treaty of versailles, the russian revolution, ww2, communism, the cold war or the fall of the ussr. I'm a fan of Mao's China and After (don't ask... long essay boring book but now I know it!)  I have to go get dressed now. Damn appointment is in the AM.

      You know what never ceases to amaze me? The little tiny sleazy girls in this world. I'm talking like, little. Today was Chelsea's grade 7 graduation. As they were called up the teachers said what they planned for their future and what they wanted to be. Some (well many actually) wanted to be veterinarians. I would correct to mom - no that one will be porn star. That one will be pregnant by 17. That one is wearing more clothes now than any time in the recent past. You could just tell that they were little sluts. I actually heard a grade eight (ie 13 years old) say that the only way to be popular is to sleep with a grade 12. They were being dead serious. These kids I saw today, many I have not seen since I was in grade 7 meaning they're in grade 3. Now they are wearing a tonne of makeup and clothes too small. They spend far too much time on their hair and look like little kids playing dress up. But they aren't!   I am not a parent. I will not be a parent for a long time. Some may use that fact to discredit what I am about to say but I am an articulate enough teenager to be able to express my opinions so I set out to do so. The parents of these girls are either blindly oblivious, screwed up themselves, or completely incompetent human beings. Yes these girls must make decisions for themselves. Yes they deserve to express themselves. No it is not ok for them to prance around wearing "rape me" buttons. These kids will come up to highschool then eventually into the real world where they will be used and abused, and it will be far too late for mommy or daddy to fix it. Parents have to take responsibility for their offspring, be aware of what they do, how they dress outside of the house. I don't believe that I am a being exempt from such behavior. I attribute the fact that I can recognize this ludicrousy to the exceptional upbringing I have received from my parents. There is no way I would ever let my 12 year old daughter out of the house dressed like she's en route to prosituteville. It is disgusting. What kind of morals does this insight into our youth? What kind of self image do they hold? How will they get through life  without  being taken advantage of when this is how they behave in society at only a dozen years? They are not barbie dolls, they are not a pop icon like Brittany Spears, they are little girls slowly growing into womanhood. But neither can one place sole blame for their behaviour on mattel or the media. They are wards of their parents and these parents have to begin to act like adults about their children before these girls can possibly emerge as productive adults themselves.

      Today I spent 8.5 hours at metrotown. AND I had a lit exam. Busy busy. Exam was ok... I wasn't worried about it at all. I was able to use the Hollow Men by TS Elliot in my essay. I can practically recite that one. "This is the way the world ends, not with a bang but a whimper." Very creepy.   Then I went to Metrotown. I was to meet my mom at 2:00. I got there at noon and didn't meet up with her until 3. One is the loneliest number... Three hours!! I don't mind one, or even two, but three was a bit much. Poor Bethie. Finally mom showed up. Apparently there used to be a street where there is a street no longer. Her bus got confused. I had some good beverages today. 1 glass milk, 1 apple juice box, 1 grande double chocolat chip creme mixed starbucks frappaccino, 1 iced tea, 1 strawberry milkshake, 1 starbucks grande caramel machiatto, 1 diet pepsi, 1 diet vanilla coke. At the mall I got a Minnie mouse tee shirt. My mom and I got two shirts, a pair of capris and a pair of shorts that apparently we're gonna "share". Yes, I know that's weird. I got a book of poetry (yes I'm a nerd) with all my favorites ranging from The Lady of Shallot, to My Last Duchess, to To Haggis. They moved the entire food court. It is physically gone from where it once was and is now way in the arse whole of nowhere on the other side of the mall near the Bay. There is better food now though.   The intended purpose was to get a shit load of x-mas presents for people in Ontario. We're giving them stuff for last Christmas AND this Christmas 'cause we're going out there and it's easier to bring shit than to send it. Also, my mom has decided that she wants to be the little cousins's favourite aunt. ie they are going to be spoiled rotten. For one of them (yes one) there is a princess tee shirt, a sleeping beauty ballerina doll, a candy necklace, a bath salt purse, a necklace with her name, a pen with her name, a snow globe, and a nightgown. I think there may be more, that's all I can recall.  Yes I;m still bitter about things in my last post. Add to that one that my legs are now extremely sore. Overall I'm quite pleased with my day though. Except I didn't get to talk to my Susie. (Despite appearances in the last post, it is surprisingly difficult for me to get ACTUALLY pissed off at her - virtually impossible really) My day just doesn't seem complete without some Suse.   tomorrow is Chelsea's grade 7 grad. I get the impression that it is going to be extremely boring as they are doing nothing special. My class all wore very fancy dresses, some even formal gowns... hers aren't even wearing sundresses or skirts. Sigh. I'm very tired, even though I had starbucks twice today. Time to go sleepybies.

      I'm losing. Badly. Well dad is already out and has been for a while so I'm not doing  that   bad. We're going to continue again when Chelsea gets home from school. Susie is making me wake up IN THE MORNING at like 8:00 to pick up a book. I am not pleased. She suggested I get Chelsea to go out and get it but that would be the kind of "sibling abuse" that my mom would consider "treating Chelsea like dirt" so that won't work. Nope. Not pleased in the least. I won't even read the damn book till like 10 o'clock tomorrow night anyhow. There is no reason for me to have it at the crack of dawn except to make Susie sadistically pleased and prevent me from sleeping in. To make matters more displeasing, she won't have the editing done for me. And I have nothing to read tonight as I won't start a new novel when I'll be receiving one I'd rather read tomorrow. Raven brought cheese cake and I can't have any till tomorrow. It's too hot out and some sick deity decided that my bedroom has to be the warmest in the house. I have a lit exam on Thursday, I'm basically ready for it but nonetheless, writing what will be among the most important exams of my life can't exactly be fun. I have a history exam on Monday that I'm not basically ready for which makes it seem so much less fun. I'm broke and still unsure how I'm going to acquire $400 for the writing conference.   Grr.

      Today I did my first day of volunteering at Burnaby hospital. I was put into the transitional care unit where the patients are waiting to be transferred into some kind of long term facility. So they are mostly older people who need assistance and my job was to chat with them.   First I met Helen, a deaf midget. She took me to meet her friend, Pat ("but my friends call me Patti, even though my name is really Bridget... I'm from Dublin") and another sweet old man whose name I never learned. He later left us and I chatted with Helen and Patti for about an hour. They were really sweet ladies.   This Josh Groban media player is really neat. I've only heard a few of the songs before. I recommend song number nine in the media player. It's called Vincent and it's about VanGoh. It is really beautiful, possibly a new favorite of mine. I did a little bit of a search on him (Groban, not vangoh) and I found out that we have the same birthday! He is exactly 6 years older than me.   I finished the Charmed Sphere last night. The end was nice, quite clever. It gave serious hints of the author being normally sci-fi. There were some serious flaws in the novel - well not really. I am quite picky in my novels as I pick apart writing styles while I try to find inspiration for my own writing. In this book I finally felt some emotion for the bad guy in like the last fifteen pages of the book. Hmmm... kinda late eh? But all in all I enjoyed it and recommend it as light reading. I am unsure what to read now though.  I'm waiting for Raven to get here so I can eat. Hehehe... sounds like I want to eat her! Today we each have eaten a muffin and a can of pop. She had a juice box and I had a glass of water. That's all. And we only spoke at like 4 o'clock. That's crazy... we're like connected! So she's on her was over so we can grab food together before Chelsea's little "party" commences. Fun with monopoly and beef jerky!

      I have to go out tomorrow! Burnaby general is ready for me (finally, after I applied in October!!!) so I have to go somewhere. grrr. Fun with transit. At least it doesn't generally confuse me like it does Susie (she had to use Broadway and Commercial today). I was about to go to bed but I had to come online to check my transit times for tomorrow and well, that meant I had to blog! I need to wake up at... 11:00. Hehehe... Susie has to leave much earlier than I even wake up.   tomorrow is also Chelsea's b-day (her actual day of birth, not her party which was on Saturday). She decided that we'll eat chicken Caesar salad, beef jerky and we'll play monopoly. This excited Raven greatly so she is going to come over after her work experience. She's going to try and get some chocolate cheese cake too. I'm glad she's coming but she doesn't like dinner. She doesn't do salad. Well, not salad with dressing anyhow. She just likes the lettuce. But only iceberg lettuce, not romaine. So she's pretty much screwed when it comes to Caesar.   I'm likely going to finish the Charmed sphere tonight. That means I'll be bookless. I was going to have Susie bring me a book when she drops off the editing. Looks like that may be a while though. *tear*. Perhaps I'll read the Rules of ascention which I got on sale at Chapters for like 6 bucks. I was going to take that to Ontario but it's really hugely hardcover and I'm going to look for some fluff fantasy at the used bookstore next week. Preferably paperback extremely escapist fluff fantasy. Woahhh... re-read that last sentence and think alliteration.   Off to bed now. Ta.

      And so my first week off begins. I have a lit exam on Thursday but aside from that I have nothing to do! I'm going to the hospital tomorrow to see about my volunteering. Ugh. I applied in October. I'll start at the end of June. Both my Susie and my Raven are at work experience right now. I just woke up.   Today I have to :   - bathe the dog  - study lit  - wrap Chelsea's birthday present.   I think I can handle it. I really really really really really want to edit. I have time in which to do so. A definite rarity.  I also plan to tell my mom about the $400 writers conference. That should be interesting. She told me not to count on the money from child minding for Cathy and she thinks I should only do it for one week. That brings me down to 160... 320 if I do two weeks and zilch if I don't get paid at all.   I'm going to go have a chocolate muffin now.

      Okee - go to the very bottom of the page and click on the Josh Groban Media player. There are songs on that thing that even I have never heard beofre (I only have his second album and these are mostly from the first). This guy has a voice like a god now you can listen to him as you browse my blog.

      Woah... like 2 days have passed since my last update! The 18th was the last day of school and I saw Troy. Drool. Orlando Bloom is GORGEOUS!! I don't wanna give away the plot to ppl who haven't seen it yet but ooh was he attractive. I think he is better looking than Brad Pitt whose features look too chisled. Major muscle action but too much by my liking. Bloom looks almost delicate. He has great hair. Eric Bana is a talented man. Very good actor. The movie starts kinda slow but the eye candy is so appreciated you don't really care. By the end you're at the edge of your seat, most likely with tears in your eyes.   Yesterday was Chelsea's b-day party. I escaped to Papa's house to study for my lit exam. That was fun. I took the dog up to keep me company.  I put the book thingy in Susie's blog today before I blogged myself. Good God I'm devoted. There's a Coldplay special I want to watch tonight. I'm going to ge try to acquire yet another fun feature for my blog... this one I'm not even copying from another bloggish person!

      I think I mentioned earlier that I want to go to the writers conference in Surrey. This means I need to raise 400 dollars by October. My July allowance will likely be spent in Ontario (if I'm cheap then maybe not, but we'll assume it is). That gives me August, September and October which is $120. I can probably clean Papa's house four times which is another $40. I can probably get 20 bucks from mom for business stuff. That gives me $180. I'll have at least $20 dollars left after Ontario so I'm at 200. That's only half. Either I have to convince my parents to pay half or do something else.   My aunt Cathy just offered me babysitting for this summer. Cathy is at school and she'll need daycare for her two kids. She's a welfare single mom so I don't expect great amounts. I'm so busy that I'll only be able to do it 4 weeks and there would be once a week that I'm volunteering at the hospital and couldn't do it. So that's 16 days for like 8 hours a day. Let's say she pays me 5 bucks an hour (I deserve more but let's assume lower rather than higher). Fourty a day times 16 days is 640. Wow. That's like more than enough. I'm really going to try to take her up on that. I'm not sure what mom will say.   I could also offer to do more chores for more money. But the baby sitting will work much better. I really hope she's all right with that.

      No more school la di da di da... Well not offically. Technichally I should be in psych class doing absolutely nothing right now. I opted to sleep through it instead. I'm gonna show up for French 'cause that teacher is a little bit of a homework freak and were're doig some make work project to have us all attend. In block C I'm writing a worksafe test then I'm gonna go home! I should go to math but I wrote the final yesterday so... why??   Tommorrow is a laugh too. We have morning classes then a school wide carnival. I'm skipping the carnival to go see Troy... Oooh pretty guys.   It's only two weeks until I go to Ontario. It is fairly likely that I'll not have a chance to blog even once when I'm gone. Tear.   I should go get dressed now.

      Yes, I still hate it, but I never have to do it again! Today I wrote my math 11 final exam. It was hard and I didn't do great on it, but now I am done. Yay!  I want to go to bed now... I'm gonna sleep through first block 'cause we're not doing anything. I get a wordsearch in French then a worksafe test (which I am not studying for on principal). Instead of going to math I am going to go home and utilize my complex's pool for the first time this season.   Oh yes, I am incredably excited about the writers conference that I am going to go to in October. It will cost me $400, yikes. But still fun. nightie night

      Did I study for my math final today? Ummm no, not really. Did I study for the stupid history thing? Yes!! So 20% of my math 11 grade is still at risk. But during block F tomorrow, Media, I can study the WHOLE block. Ditto with CAPP block G. So that's like 2 and a half hours of studying. Plus I studied in math today. So I should be alright. Be prepared for royal bitch session after school tomorrow. A very very long math final. I hate math.   I did watch the Sound of Music today. And a bunch of music videos and the last hour of Miss Congeniality. It was on TBS. "The hills are alive!!!" Susie and I hope to convince the drama teacher that a musical is a splendid idea for next year. However, there are very few people willing to sing and dance. Especially males. Sound of Music has very few key males - Captain VonTrappe, Freidrick, Kurt, Uncle Max (who doesn't sing) and Mr 17 going on 18 fellow whose name I cannot remember. Only VonTrappe has to have a great voice. Then there are the 4 girls (only Lisel has to have a good voice), Maria, The fiance (who doesn't sing), and the 4 nuns (only one of which has an important part.) I think we should push for that one. It sounds perfect. Unless of course I think of something better.   Time to make lunch and acquire beauty sleep. Night night.

      You know, I kinda feel like Garfield. I say "I hate Math" about as often as he says "I hate Mondays! I have a final tomorrow. It's worth 20% of my grade. I feel very little confidence. It's gonna take 2.5 hours to write. That's a bloody long time. And I don't think I'll do very well on it. Oh bother.   I also have a History mock-provincial tomorrow. I don't feel ready to study that yet. Susie thinks that is a most creative approach to an excuse but it's true! The exam isn't until June 28 and I have no school from the 18th until then to study. That is 10 days of down and dirty studying where I can devote long hours, develop a routine and practice for long uninterrupted periods of time. That's how I study best. I know I will be well prepared for this provincial... But for the mock? I donno.   Aside from that I expect tomorrow will be dreadfully uneventful. Today wasn't really a thrill either. No French homework, which is a first... no homework at all actually. Anywhere. That means tonight I get to study Math and History. I detest math and the world from 1919 - 1991 is not material to hold my attention.   It's 4 o'clock so my music video show just started (MMMusic top10.com on much more music). I'll go watch them and... read my History workbook. I'll be back later tonight.

      It appears that the confrontation during block G wasn't too bad afterall. The guy didn't pour his heart out, break down into tears or confess drastic actions. In fact he didn't really say much. I think the melodrama of teen issues is mostly a girl thing. Guys have their issues too and they can be just as bad but they don't seem to be soap opera or tragic screenplay material like with the ladies. Susie therefore did not cry - so sorry to have underestimated her delicate constitution... or something to that extent. In any case I'm glad it went well emotionally, disappointed that she wasn't able to be of any more help to the guy.   Hehehe... I hacked onto her blog to give her a counter. She was rather surprised. That was the idea. She even liked the color. I was tempted to give her ugly apple things but then she'd kill me. I was gonna get her a guest book too but I'm gonna look for a different guestbook site. I like how my guestbook looks but I don't like how it looks on the blog. I can't seem to get that "View My Guestbook" thing on a different line from the guest book button. Also, it looks like you're supposed to click the button but you're not, you're supposed to click the thing on top. Notice the little smiley face thing? That's my imood (internet mood I think it stands for) and I can change it whenever I like. It's kinda cool. I'm also working on this other little gadget involving what books I read. Stay tooned!   Susie posted four times today. It's only 9:00 leaving her plenty of time for at least one more. Good god. I though I was becoming obsessed. But this is really quite therapeutic. Like a diary without the hand cramps and messy had writing. And other people, people you don't know, can read it (and Susie but she would read a real diary of mine anyways). You can also play with fun websitey stuff. I am slowly getting the hang of HTML. Woah. Gonna go try that other gadget now. Yes I know I should study for my math test. But ummm no.

      I'm in CAPP right now. Career and Personal Planning for those not in the loop. A most boring and relatively pointless class. After today I only have one more. Today we're watching Pay it Forward but Kevin Spacey is among the most frightening actors in the world (though I do like this movies) and he should be watched as a potential threat to the national security. Scary scary man. Also, Haley Joel Osmette is somewhat annoying. And Jon Bon Jovi is in this movie too which is just weird.   I changed my counter and yes I know there is an add there.. Apparently if I delete it my counter account will get deleted as well. Mr. Luggage is gone and I guess it is something else now. I have a guest book too. If it works. Maybe. I think.   I am a little anxious at the moment. Susie is supposedly talking to that guy that I mentioned earlier that was suicidal. I know if she needs me she'll come get me. To tell you the truth, I'm as worried about her as I am about him. This all comes down to an Asian supremacist racist shit-head who's been harassing him and last week physically beat on him. This asswhole is in her mandarin class and he picks on her there as she is one of the only white kids in the class. She is trained in martial arts. She's gonna be pissed off after talking to her friend and she has mandarin block H... Next. This shit isn't easy on her. People come to her when they need help and she helps them. Which is fine. But the numbers are adding up. I can't even help much as this guy is barely more than an acquaintance of mine.   We have other troubled friends. There are four more days of school. When these four days are over we can't see them five days a week anymore.   Susie is in a bad mood to begin with. She was up doing homework until 1:30 this morning. She had printer trouble at break. She obediently followed me to rehearsal and she forgot her homework at home. Her dad will drop it off. Still though, bad day. Now she's in the counselor's conference room hearing god knows what, god knows what he's confessing to her and god knows how she'll react. Don't get me wrong. With him she'll be perfect. When she gets home she'll cry. These two facts I could bet on. It is everything else I'm not sure about.   I'm gonna go look at some fun features to add to my blog now. Perhaps I'll post again in the next 40 minutes before class ends.

      Shrek 2 is a blast. Absolutely hilarious! It is certainly a movie that is good for adults and for kids (although there was this lady in the elevator who insisted that it was a terrible children's movie because it involved a cross dressing bar tender, a thong on a puppet, and "sexually suggestive" scenes... Some people have never heard of double entendre!). It was splendid.   Puss in boots was fantastic. They spoofed many shows including Lord of the Rings and Garfield... And king Kong cookie style. The theatre was so full that we had to sit in the second row. Kids went nuts over the Sponge Bob Movie preview... There are many questions to be asked in this world - are we alone? Is there life after death? But today we ask you just one of these questions... Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?  My mom claims I have to be in bed by 9pm tonight. Isn't she cute? In bed maybe. Asleep? Hell no.   Off to study math. Only two more classes of it EVER... And a final worth 20% of my grade...

      Friday was the Lord of the Rings marathon. We got through most of it, the first 2 and the first hour of the third... We finished in the morning. That is one beautiful elf. Truly gorgeous elf man. It was kinda sad though 'cause Raven wasn't there and these are her fave movies ever. I told her we could do it again with special editions (which will take 12 hours rather than 9!!) as soon as she gets number three. Also, we found out that a friend is suicidal. He's not much more than an acquaintance of mine, but he is closer to Raven and Susie and it hits tough as there is exactly five more days of school and we can't watch our troubled friends after that.  Last night was the ranger party. Not many showed up though. The twins came at 7:30 then Meg S came at like 8... Lauren was next at about 8:30 taking us to four whole people. Ang and Sarah came at like midnight and ten mins later the twins left and Lauren left at 12:30. Only Meg S, Sarah and Ang spent the night. We played every single card of my Planet Hollywood game, ate lots of food and watched Chocolat with Johnny Depp.   Today I get to see Shrek 2. Very exciting.   I just had a very long talk with Raven about Lord of the rings. She is one of those obsessed type people and I'm... not. I like them but I haven't read the books and I'm not as infatuated as she is. I think she appreciated it though, getting to chat about them even though she couldn't go to the party. I was glad to make her happy. She didn't have a good weekend. Her dad called yesterday which is never good. She then apparently cried for two hours until she couldn't breath. Her mom decided not to go to the hospital for her check up even though she has a bad heart. At church she learned that a friend in her youth group has been in the hospital for 10 days with some disease and needs a liver transplant. And I partied all weekend.   Susie couldn't see the counter of which I was so proud in the last post... I can. Maybe her computer was confused.

      I was looking at my blog this morning and was thrilled to see that one of my blogs had two comments. I immediately assumed they were from Susan 'cause I mean, who else reads this thing? But Susie and I discuss it so... Please don't comment Susie, it'll get my hopes up! So I look at my two comments (OK, it was the same comment accidentally posted twice) and it was someone replying to what I said about lack of stats. She told me I could go get a web counter. Oooh. Aaah. Not only did I get one, I MANAGED TO GET IT ON MY BLOG!! I am like technologically inept. I had to use html all by myself. I theoretically could have gotten my Procter (computer geek friend who runs the writers club website) but that would imply that he would have to know about this blogger. That would ensue incessant teasing. I used html. Like woah.   Now unfortunately I'm gonna have to try to do it again to Susie's. Oh, and somehow mrluggage.com was trying to advertise on my blog and I figured out how to get rid of that... Using html.   This is the only time I've sunk to blogging before I go to school. Only because I didn't have time to yesterday and it was killing me. And I most likely won't have another chance today... unless I post at Susie's house.  PS - thank you so much helpful commenter. It was much appreciated.

      You know what I hate? Stupid people.   Moving on... I didn't do my CAPP homework tonight. I feel like banging my head against the wall. I'm getting a C. I have NEVER, EVER gotten a C in ANYTHING. This is uber crises and guess what I did? Spent 2 hours lying in bed. Not reading. Not sleeping. Not listening to music. I was extremely tired for no good reason and I simply could not motivate myself to get up to answer pointless questions about topics that I know more than the teacher about! I hate that class. Hate it. That means I have to catch up on my CAPP during media class which means I can't be available if Jess needs me. Which sounds ridiculous I know. That is one of my primary reasons for attending that class. Last time I helped her through tough times she ignored me for months afterwards, seemingly trying to forget that she had had serious issues that I had been there to help her through. Now I feel bad for not being that when she  might  need me. Grr.  You know what (among others things) I contemplated while in my state of half meditation on my bed? How I will ever publish "Quoth the Raven" before psycho mom dies, without being sued. Then I shifted to what cover art for "Avatar's Crown" Should look like. Then I considered what nudists wear in the winter. That last was actually on the phone with Susie, but I was still in bed so it counts.   We had chicken and rice for dinner. It was yummy. Tomorrow I'm stuck with meatpies. I hate meat pies. My tow hurts. Wonder why.

      Raven and I have math in the same block. She is in math 11 applications and I am in principals of math 11 (mine is the harder course, hers is halfway between normal and stupid person math) but I'm two doors down from her. Neither of us have any friends in our math class. I'll go to the washroom and look longingly into her class. She'll go to the vending machine and look achingly into mine. All year we've said we should meet in the bathroom and today we did! I haven't done that since grade 4 when I always used to meet my friend Ashley in the washroom. It was fun. Ashley is now a drug addict whore living in Winnipeg who stopped being my friend by the end of grade 4 when I was no longer cool enough to be her friend.   Susie and I are planning Raven's birthday party. It's this thing we do where we all plan parties for eachother. Raven's was the first one we ever did and this will be the third year we've done hers. Raven's are always the best 'cause they have both Susie and I planning them, it's close to the end of school and we have wicked imaginations. Her first party we gave her had a HUGE scavenger hunt that took her all over the community figuring out out creative clues like a puzzle where the pieces were hidden in the community garden. The next was a Hawaiian theamed backyard barbecue sleep over where we had a bon fire and slept in tents and got Susie's gnome to hula dance for us in an authentic grass skirt. This year is childrens themed, we're inviting more people that ever before (like 25) and we're gonna hire a clown. How cool is that?!  I'm gonna go start a new book now. Or sleep. Or do homework. Or talk to Susie on the phone. I donno which, but I assure that all those things are going to happen sometime tonight.

      Susie is over. Susie is cooking my dinner. I've been exiled from the kitchen. All my food habits and ideas are inherrantly wrong. No matter what I do, if it is in a kitchen it is wrong. I'm am teased relentlessly and yes it is a tad irksome. WE were spicing up my mom's rather bland tomatoe sauce, cooking pasta and, apparently, making garlic bread. My Raven tells me that I have an eating disorder - that I cannot eat without making a mess (I once got scrambled egg on the wall in my cruise ship cablin). My sister and my Susie cringe whenever sI suggest I cook something.   So I'm here. Blogging. And rather trusting. It'll taste good I'm sure, but nonetheless... My kitchen. That used to mean something. Pout. I'll get to do the dishes. Joy. Some housewife I'll make (not that I have any intention of ever doing so). I took half a year of foods eleven this year and I got 90%. But... Oh no!! Bethie cannot cook.   Sigh. I've felt like blogging all day. The novelty hasn't worn off yet. Now that I'm here all I can think of to say is bitching about my lack of kitchen skills. Susie and I will one day move in together. By then I have to convince her that I have decent kitchen skills. I am a picky eater yes, not an incompetent one. Apparently I have to stir pasta now.

      Susie today was calling me a Marxist. Yup, me a little communist. Here we go...  My Ranger group was arranging a movie night sleepover but we didn't know where to do it. I was able to get permission to have it at my place if we absolutely positively could not do it anywhere else. Meanwhile, Susie was planning a Lord of the Rings marathon night. ON THE SAME WEEKEND. Troublesome. Susie was planning on the Friday. Rangers on the Saturday. Guess what? We couldn't find another location. So I got to present this plan to my mother. Friday after school to Susie's, home, clean house, 10 fifteen to nineteen yearolds come over, they leave, we go to Shrek 2. That leaves like, very little family/homework/sleeping time. That crams ten teens into a condo much too small for that kind of spatial abuse. We were expecting either laughter or yelling.   "But it works in theory!" I exclaim, knowing that I could swing it as far as time was concerned. As for realistically and parental consent...  "Yes, and communism works  in theory !" she answers, sure that I am doomed to failure on the parental battlefeild of permission.  Well, guess what? I got it! I got the permission. Which, in Susie's books, makes me a little Communist. Oh well, it is afterall, a lovely ideal.

      I am a language major - ie English. It's a language and I love how I can manipulate it to suit my needs, how I can use it to express myself creatively and utilize it as a necessary means of communications, a hobby, and an art form. I take French, rather unsuccessfully I admit. Today Susie and I did a non-verbal communication thing where she had to deal with a friend in need and I had to distract everyone else in the room so she could do so. It's mutual. Sometimes I'm on the other end. It was the writers club - last meeting of the year THANK GOD!   Anyway, Jess came in looking ready to cry. I previously described her as low-moderately troubled... Let's just say that fluxuates at she is approaching high again. Susie went to counsel her and I got to deal with the rest of the club. I had to make enough noise to drown out their conversation but not distract them, and I had to deal with restless June-stricken writers, unwilling to actually write at our last meeting. One girl, Anastasia is, you guessed it, Russian. She began to teach us basic Russian and it was my job to make people bloody enthralled with the language. It worked. There were like 6 teens gathered around a white board willingly picking up a foreign language - a little bit of a miracle if you ask me.   It turns out that Russian is a fairly simple language and I kinda wish my school offered it. I just may take an available course if there were one. There is no tangible "th" sound which made my name tough. Once you got past the different alphabet with like 33 letters it wasn't too bad.   It turns out Jess's cousin with whom she is extrodinarily close has been diagnosed with lung cancer and has been allowed one more year of existence. Yikes. Combined with other shit that's been happening to her lately, this could spiral her into another lapse of severely troubled. I should come up with a point value for "troubledness of teen" I'll be there to help her out whether she likes it or not (which may turn out to be a 'not' as she was less that thankful last time...).  Russian is cool. Friends need help, again. That about sums up my day. Oh yeah... Only 4 more math classes EVER!!!  Cheers

      I did a lot of typing today. Lots. I had to type virtually everything that the writer's club that I co-chair wrote in an entire year in one afternoon. Good God... I do believe this will be brief.   I mention a few times that I love to write (see profile) and I guess anyone reading this may wonder if I actually am writing anything. (By the way I have no way of tracking the stats of this blog unless I upgrade and buy the better blogger so there may be no one ever reading this thing... In which case I have mild schizophrenia). Susie and I are writing a novel currently titled Avatar's Crown. It is a fantasy novel of some 340 complete manuscript pages. We are currently editing. Originally I wrote chapter one then e-mailed it to Susie who wrote chapter two and so on and so forth. We have 41 chapters and an epilogue now. I got to edit 10 pages then she edited 10 pages and this will continue until we are through. We hope we will eventually be able publish it. That would be awesome. We actually entered it in a contest but that is somewhat worrisome as we never heard back from them... And it cost us each 30 bucks for the entry fee and postage from here to Washington state return.  I love my Avatar's Crown. The main character is Laleena and the antagonist is her "evil" sister Taryne. People will be hearing a significant bit about this writing project and if anyone ever reads this and wants to know more, perhaps I could post for you the 2 page synapse that I have written as a necessary part of the contest mentioned above. Because I spent the day doing the Writer's club stuff Susie said she would spend the day editing. I hope she did. She's the other co-chair so theoretically should have done half the work. I excuse her completely from that duty if she succeeded in getting a significant part of her editing done.  Susie by the way now apparently has a blog... I don't know the site, I've been looking for it. It's out here somewhere. I'm sick of typing and my bum is going numb. So long.

      I just realized how vague that last post must sound. It really isn't that bad. Well, yes it is very bad, and yes I am still upset about it, but there really isn't a lot that can be done.   Next weekend I am going to see either Shrek 2 or Troy with my family. I'm kinda hoping for Shrek 2 so I can go see the other one with some friends. I mean Orlando Bloom is HOT! That Eric Bana guy doesn't look bad either though I've only seen him in the previews. I'm not actually a huge Brad Pitt fan. My mom, dad, sister and papa (yes, he's still here) are watching Beethovan 3... you know, the one with the dogs? I don't like those movies. They seriously bore me.   My ranger group is arranging a sleep over for like movies and chatting and stuff but we don't know where to have it. I live in a tiny condo where ten 16 - 19 year old girls would be quite cramped but so far no one else had found a place we can do it. That could be a tight squeese. They want to make "Be Prepared" Condoms. That is the girl guide motto and we recently realized how appropriate that will be on a condom rapper. Quite amusing really.

      I'm a teenager. Part of the job is being troubles and/or having troubled friends. I am the epitome of non-troubled. Susie recently commented that I am her gift from above as a non-troubled friend. Susie is mot very troubled herself just normal teen stuff. Some complicated family shit is happening at the moment. Other moderate-to-highly troubled friends include Cate and Jess and a few other acquaintances. But the most troubled is my Raven. My blackbird. My nevermore. She's my oldest friend and one of my closest. The only one closer is Susie. But I love nevermore so much and I am so concerned for her. Susie is intimately connected to my mind, nevermore is my heart.  I don't want to go into the real trouble right now. She may one day read this blog and I wouldn't want her to see me spilling her issues on the world wide web. Her life SUCKS and I am so afraid that she is going to do something terrible. She has to move out. Her 17th birthday is at the end of the month. Just over a year until she can go. But first she needs a job 'cause she can't go anywhere without money. Susie and I were discussing low-income housing in the area... possible places she can work... how we will motivate her enough to do enough homework to not only graduate but to hopefully make it into a college or something. But even if she doesn't she has to get out. She has to.  I had a massive convo with her on MSN and she told me that she blames herself for the situation she is in. She can't do that, she can't. It isn't her fault but she cannot see that. I was physically shaking at the keyboard as I chatted with her. It's really tough.   On a lighter note...  Papa is over today. He's my grandpa on my mom's side. He is here a lot but almost never on a Saturday. Probably because he is going to Montreal on Tuesday for a wedding and we won't see him for three weeks. Then two days later we go to Ontario to visit my 98 year old grandmother. So we won't see him for a while. Ok, we'll him pop up on a Saturday. It just screws up my internal papa clock is all. I'll get over it.

      Today on the phone Susie and I were talking about the importance of true love. A friend of ours has little to no expectation of ever finding true love and we both find something wrong with that. I mean, what really, is the purpose to life where you never find love? Why live a life if you never find that match, that part of your soul that needs to be filled by another. The joys of waking up in the night beside someone you love, of being doted upon unnecessarily and being completed in every way are essential to a life of purpose.  Don't we all have the empty part of us that  needs  to be filled? Right now I fill it with the love of my family and my closest friends. But there is an underlying loneliness that only comes out when I'm down, a damper on festivities. I have never been in love. But that is my greatest fear. More than dying, of drowning, of becoming seriously ill, I fear never falling love.  That is why I think that Disney movies are the best films ever made. They show that love does exist. They give an ideal to developing hearts. I don't care if some people think that that ideal is unrealistic or unattainable, but it is what I strive for. I want to fall in love like Disney's princesses. A movie usually just isn't worth it for me if it doesn't include any love interest. I get teased about it by my friends, but it is true. I love love.   The world is just so cynical and more and more often people are made all too soon to believe that fairy tales cannot come true. People simply are not willing or not able to see that the beauty in these tales must be achievable... or else what is there?   I do not begrudge people with different beliefs from me. I don't care if you believe in one god or many, I don't care if you believe there is a heaven or hell or if you believe in karma and reincarnation. I just hope, for the sake of what humanity stands for, you believe in love. To be human is to have the capacity to love. And hate. But to love is profound and to hate is petty. No, I'm not a flower child hippie. I'm a romantic. Overly so, yes, but happily so as well. Love in an intrinsic part of life, and the people who cannot see that, cannot truly live.

      I've like signed out then signed back in, I've posted once and made some changes to my settings. I've viewed what I have. I'm not exactly a techie (understatement) so I wasn't too sure how this all was gonna work out for little ol' me. Wait till Susie hears about this... hehehe... Anyone who reads this will be hearing quite a bit about my friends as well but for the time being, the only one I'll tell will probably be Susie. She is afterall, my other half.   I'm still not 100% sure I've got this whole thing worked out so... I'm gonna go check again!

      I've never ever done this before but I thought that a blog might be a fun thing to do. I can bitch to no one in particular and possibly find that someone somewhere is interested in my life. I once found myself reading a blog of someone I didn't know, mostly because their site was called "This is your Goldfish Speaking" and they were quite amusing. I also read the blog of one of my favourite authors Laurell K Hamilton. I'm gonna end this post now so I can see what it looks like, but I will likely post again today as the novelty of course has not yet worn off.

      I so shouldn't be doing this right now, but I couldn't resist. I am having a blast!! The youngest counsellor here is only 2 years older than me so it is a tonne of fun.     I miss my Susie emmensly. I am on the internet prepping for a debate I have to do tommorrow. It's about the international monetary fund AND I have to write a persuasive speech AND memorize a dramatic monolougue all for tommorrow.     Susie I don't have time to check your blog, partly 'cause I'm too busy, partly 'cause I can't spell paralel or parallel or paralel or whatever. The english language and I have decided I'll never spell that word.    I was kinda reluctant on the first ight 'cause I didn't think I'd like anyone. One guy freaked me out (I"ll explain later) but the longer I'm here the more I like it. I am SOOO hot. The grounds here are gorgeous. I have never seen somewhere waer its grass so much in my life. The common room has the largest television screen I have ever seen. People are great.     I'm busy so I have to go. I love you Susie!!

       I leave today for debate camp. I'll be home on Saturday. I meant to blog yesterday but with the picnic and all I ended up very busy. Raven spent the night (which doesn't happen often I might add) so I didn't get on the computer. The picnic was nice. Very small. Not as many people as usual.     &nbsp;  I saw Edward Scissorhands last night for the first time. Very tragic little movie. It was on YTV. What a terrible movie for a youth channel! I enjoyed it though.    &nbsp;  I appologise to any non-Susie readers for all the edit talk this week. I'm sure it isn't exactly exciting. That was stuff I'd usually say on the phone with her. She comes back today. I miss her! I can't see her before camp.    &nbsp;  I can't believe it but I am having minor camp anxieties. I haven't been to a camp where I haven't known anyone since I was 8. When I was eight didn't make any friends. These are debate people and therefore notorious for being talkative but I don't relish the idea of being lonely for a week...    &nbsp;  This next is exclusively for Susie (well,&nbsp; others can read it if you like but it will be completely irrelevant to your life :) )    On the Edit:    1) If Raven hadn't spent the night I would have finished the Laleena part. I'm  this  close *makes finger motion of about a centimeter*   2) Laleena is very long. Very very long. Like 15 pages. That is for both chapters though and is broken into like five or six smaller parts with the tripple stars.    3) Go full speed ahead! Finish Fraser, and do Taryne... I didn't have time. You want the Fraser/Laleena in 17 - go for it.    4) 'Bout that Fraser/Laleena bit... when she escapes she is NOT a man. She doesn't transform into Jeremiah 'cause that just didn't fit with how my fingers dictated it. I had very little say in the matter myself. She is tired and had been held hostage for like 4 or 5 days. She wasn't spelled to the bed, just locked in the room to get rid of that technicality of Marmee having too much power. There was some magic involved though. She will have a little girl with her, about 5 named Aida. Aida lives with the embroidery Mistress. I don't know why, just some sticky situation at home. I don't plan on having Aida accompany them, she will go back to the Mistress's unless you have some use for a little girl... Aida helped Laleena escape using a dumbwaiter - in case it comes up. Oh, and it is dusk. However, that can easily be changed if it makes your job inconvienient. That's all I think you'll need to know to do that part.     &nbsp;  On Everything else:   1) I will miss you like mad and you are welcome to be creepy friend and come sleep in my bed if you like.    2) Raven is going to Victoria for the day on Monday with her Mom, but she has the entire week off from the museum so her days are available.   3) I hope you had a blast in Calgary and that the family drama wasn't too insane.   4) I haven't checked the writers board even once... I just don't really care.   5) I love you and miss you, and can't wait to see you in August.    I   have to go get dressed now as I have a ferry to be at. I hope I get my own bedroom. That would be cool.     &nbsp;  Yesterday's edit: 0 pages (sorry, Raven and picnic and all....)   The day before yesterday's edit: 1 page (Uh, LKH did 24 pages. I'd feel like a schmuck if I didn't do any!)

       Spent the day at IKEA. Gee I love that store. I found my bed, the guest bed/couch that will go in my office, my office chair, my library chair, my bookshelves for my library and my shower curtain. Now I need a fortune, a house, and parents that feel ready to part with me. I need a Susie, and her parents being ok parting with her. I didn't see the purple couch of which Susie is so fond, but I'm sure we could find one. Oh, I saw my dining room table too.    &nbsp;  We then went to eat, still in Ikea of course. We each had 2 hotdogs and a drink, and a cinnamon bun. As this was lunch/dinner I decided we had best get half a dozen cinnamon buns to eat and bring home for later. Chelsea wanted frozen yogurt and it worked out so that we had to buy one more cinnamon bun so mom and dad could each have one. We bought 9 cinnamon buns all together.     &nbsp;  On the way home we went to the mall. I got head phones 'cause my previous ones were oh so dead and Chelsea didn't want me stealing hers. I was very proud of her: on more than one occasion today she showed hint of personality. She dragged me, literally, out of Coles becuase I was looking at, in order: fantasy books, children's books, books about nostradamus, a fantasy encylclopedia and some classics. In walmart, she talked me out of the electronics department before I bought a beethovan CD. She has this deep bred oppinion that thou shalt not listen to classical music as it is boring. I disagree but didn't mind too much as I didn't really want to spend a lot of money today.     &nbsp;  We walked home from the mall which was stupid because we'd been walking all day and were already suffering from sore feet. Got home and vegged on couch watching first Spiderman then Inu Yasha repeats. Just finished filling water ballooons for the picnic tommorrow.     &nbsp;  I haven't had a chance to edit today which grieves me as I was getting into a very nice writing groove. Don't give up hope. It's another hour or two at least until I collapse in exaustion. I really should read some of 1984. I'd rather edit. Hmm. Laurell K Hamilton wrote 24 pages today. Wholly crap! On an average day I'll shell out four or five. On a kick ass day I can manage maybe ten. Then again she is a professional author who has the luxury of writing all day without, grr, homework even in the summer months. Still, 24 pages is awsome. Perhaps she shall inspire me. To waddle to the computer. And turn it on. And write.     &nbsp;  Off to try that. Too hot!!!!

        I just watched an eppisode of Chip n' Dale Rescue Rangers. That was one of my favorite shows when I was a kid. I wanted to be just like Gadget. It was the only time I ever wanted to be a scientist.   There is no way I'm gonna finish 1984 before I go to camp. I'm beginning to remember why I didn't much like it the first time. It's boring and when you've read it once, you've got the whole "Oh my god! They got rid of all freedoms" message covered. Admittedly, I am getting more out of it because I took history and know significantly more about the Russian references but still, not exactly a fun read.   I going to Ikea today. Why? 'Cause I have nothing else to do. Chelsea's never been there and it will only be my second time. We're gonna go around three then have supper there. Yay!   I'm crazily missing Susie. I keep checking her blog. If the phones before four I don't find myself grinning expectantly (Raven can't phone before then because she volunteers).   The edit is getting rediculous. I'm now at like 13 pages of Laleena. Susie should be creating a whole whack of Fraser and we'll be doing stuff with Taryne so it will end up split up, but right now I have 13 solid pages of one character. I've been writing to Evanescence and determined that Susan was right, that does work well. While I'm not anywhere near the darkest part of the novel, it isn't exactly happy-joy land either.   I should go get dressed now.   Yesterday's edit: 2 pages

       This morning I finished Pillars of Creation Sword of Truth book 7 by Terry Goodkind. That's a mouthful. It did, as Susan warned, move very slowly until the end. It also had virtually none of the characters from previous books, including the most important ones, play any kind of major part. The two main characters from the past six books did not make an appearance until page 620. That was rather annoying. But things did come together in the end. As usual Goodkind got a tad bit preachy with his moral as he usually does, but that's alright -&nbsp;I figure it is for the benefit of those not as bright as me (ie the majority of Americans and newfies - hehe just joking). I thought that one of the character's roles was a little far fetched but I forgave him for it as the character was involved in true love thus making them ok in my books!     &nbsp;   Now I have to read 1984 by George Orwell. I've already read it but it is part of my summer homework for English AP. I promised my mom I would do one book in July and one in August. Well, I'm running out of July and going to Debate camp on Sunday. I get to power read it  and  do an assignments. Joy.     &nbsp;   At debate camp I'm going to the Notebook by Nicholas Sparks. I really want to see the movie and I saw the book on sale in costco in Ontario so got it for the flight. As I mentioned earlier I only got to page 8. My mom is reading it now and said that by page 10 you know the moral is "True love conquers all". Yes! my kinda book! *hopeless romantic*. She says it is boring, predictable and a harlequin romance for virgins. I think I'll enjoy it especially because it will be an easy read and they're gonna make me think at camp.     &nbsp;   I have to get ready to go to the mall now. We need a new barbecue. Why I am required for bbq picking out I don't know. Oh well.     &nbsp;   Yesterday's edit: 2 and a bit pages + half an hour of research (dumbwaiters and stages of pregnancy)

       Why don't people use e-mail for its intended purpose? I&nbsp; e-mailed a friend the other day commenting that she rarely e-mails me and that I was being given a sense of loneliness as  nobody  really e-mails me. She replied saying that people don't use the service to - gasp - communicate but rather as a means to send annoying/amusing forwards, and to facilitate their instant messaging service. Why e-mail someone, she asks, when you can talk to them on MSN?     &nbsp;   I like getting e-mails. Its like opening a casual letter. It is a bright spot in a dull day to get somebody's thoughts sent out to you. E-mail serves very well to reach groups of people. My ranger group communicates with e-mail as does my writers club. I send out important info to my friends. This, according to my msn advocate is appropriate use but a "Hi, how do you do?" isn't how the masses use it.     &nbsp;   I say why not? I am a teen who spends hours on the phone daily. If some of what my friends talked to me about was said via e-mail it would give my mom less to bitch about. Yes, I'd still spend a bunch of time on the phone, but it may be doing more productive things like planning birthday parties, editing stuff or getting ready for a trip to the mall. random chatter, the kinda stuff I often blog about, is great to talk about on e-mail.     &nbsp;   Nothing will ever beat face-to-face communication. But when it comes to electronic and technological aides, why don't we use them to our advantages? Whoever reads this, do me a favour: go e-mail a friend for no particular reason, just to say hi. Maybe one you haven't heard from in a while. Its a great way to keep in touch, use it!

       My mom has decided that she isn't going to go get groceries until we eat a majority of the food in the house. This means we have no food. Well we have food, its not like the cupboards are empty or anything, but there is nothing to eat. Do we understand? There is... cake mix, shake and bake, rice, tinned vegetables, chef boy ardee, peanut butter, coffee, ketchup & mustard&nbsp;ect. We don't have bread or cheese or fresh veggies or other foods commonly considered "staple". So I haven't had lunch yet.   "And then the missionaries burned the fort coming from the river of Toronto where they were met by the Iroquois...." Argh papa watches the most boring shows at the most annoyingly loud volumes.   I think I shall keep a record here of how much I edit daily. I know others keep note of how much they exercise and such. For me to actively keep track will hopefully keep me from getting too sidetracked. I know some people who write would only when in a writing mood. But I happen to know that one does not often come upon a writing mood if one does not write. You have to get into a groove where when you start you don't want to stop. Occasionally you are just too busy to write and you lose the groove. This is a dangerous sidetrack for a developing author.   When I record what I have edited it will be in regard to how many pages are supposedly done (ie not to be looked at again until *shudder* the  next  edit.) So if the original manuscript for a scene was one page and it was extended to three pages, I will record that as three pages edited rather than one. All the editing "chunks" are approximately 10 pages and these "chunks" either grow or shrink according to what needs done. Also, I will be recording what I edited the day before because I often don't get back on the computer after editing because my fingers hurt. I have not yet edited today but I will, and I did yesterday so I will record yesterday's progress. This is mostly for Susie's and my benefit so anyone else feel free to ignore it or maybe comment asking about how its coming (I would be thrilled to share - it is afterall a passion). That's all for today.   Yesterday's edit: 1 and a quarter pages.

       No, I am not going to name all my posts in regard to how long Susie is away.     &nbsp;  I hope.     &nbsp;  Today was volunteer at hospital day and was much more pleasant than last week. Last week my old people were damn grouchy and determined to go home. I still really only visit Helen and Patty. Today one of Patty's daughters brought her niece for a visit (ie Patty's great granddaughter). She was four years old and a real cutie. I think she was kinda scared of Helen. Patty was so happy to see the kid though, it was sweet. The three of them went for a walk leaving me with Helen. Helen talks a lot more when it is just the two of us 'cause she's deaf and that way she doesn't feel like she's intruding on the conversation. Another lady named Helen came to chat too. It was a nice day with the elderly.    &nbsp;  Susie left me very detailed instructions on her blog. I mean very detailed outlining everything from how/what to edit and what to do if I run out of boks to read... check it out.   urlLink  Its pathetic   . Hehehe... I used a hyperlink 'cause she's incompetent and couldn't figure it out. Whahaha I feel superior. But not really. Because I miss her.     &nbsp;  Papa's asleep on the couch. Mom is out. Grr. If papa weren't here Chelse and I would be home alone. That is preferable. But while the mother figure is out I think I'll take advantage of that and do a little bit of editing. Or reading. Or something.     &nbsp;  I'll be visiting my friend blogger often the next few days as I will not be spending hours on the phone or having spontaneous sleepovers. Then I go to debate camp the day she returns and she gets to be as pathetic as I am right now.

       Recall that writing contest that I mentioned a while back? The one where I spent a ridiculous amount of money on postage, but then I didn't but it was still expensive anyway? And then we didn't know if they got it 'cause they were choosing to not respond to any e-mails we sent? We got the results today.  &nbsp;  There were 13 entries. Ours came in last. Last. 13th. Lucky 13...  &nbsp;  Hoo boy. I didn't honestly expect to  win  the contest. But&nbsp;I thought we'd&nbsp;do alright. We had three different judges. One judge failed us. Yup, we got something like 42% (Susie has the actual forms).  BUT , a different judge gave us 84%.&nbsp;On&nbsp;the first contest for our first novel I can deal with an 84/100. Especially when the winner's&nbsp;average score was 89!! Our other judge gave us 60-something.  &nbsp;  No one likes to come in last. Last sucks. Especially on the first try. But going into this whole writing-to-be-published thing we knew we'd face rejection upon rejection upon rejection until finally somebody decided that Avatar's Crown was worth publishing. This was not an official "rejection" this was losing a contest. Pretty close though.  &nbsp;  And ya know what? We'll almost certainly face rejection again&nbsp;but that's Ok because I still believe in our novel. I  know  we have a solid, action packed plot. I  know  that&nbsp;our characters develop nicely into real people. I  know  that our world is creative, new and well thought out. I  know  that&nbsp;our writing has talent even if it&nbsp;is sometimes a diamond-in-the-rough type&nbsp;talent. I  know  that some of our writing is getting much better than when we started, ie dialogue, and that as our&nbsp;talent grows it is going to get only&nbsp;better.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I am going to look on this contest as a positive thing. It took some courage to put it out there. I am 17 years old, Susan is 16 - to put our novel, our baby, out there to a world of seasoned adult authors who have had more experience, more training, more money and more time, knowing that success wasn't the most likely result wasn't exactly easy. We did it though and it is a first step that makes it  real . On the looong walk back to school after we mailed that entry and had spent way too much on postage we knew that "dammit, we  are  going to publish that book".  &nbsp;  I am going to look at the constructive criticism that our third judge (84%) gave us and try to use it to improve my craft. I am going to look at the first judge, who failed us, as the inevitable person who for whatever reason will simply not like Avatar's Crown. We can't expect every person out there to love it. That is obviously an unrealistic expectation; but that one of our judges took time to write a short letter outlining what he/she liked about our entry and what he/she didn't like, that put time and effort into showing us that he/she appreciated our attempt and can see our potential is beautiful.  &nbsp;  We are going to publish our novel. We will see our names in print. It will take this edit and another one besides until it can meet market standards but it will get there. And in two, five or ten years, when we are being interviewed as successful authors, we will look back to the day we came in last and laugh at the irony of developing talent. As I said to Susan - well at least it's last not second last 'cause last is just so much more dramatic!  &nbsp;  We knew going in that our work wasn't as polished as we would have liked. We will have other chances. Now we are simply more prepared for when these chances arise.

       Yesterday was lots of fun. I really enjoyed spending the day with Raven and Susie and especially enjoyed seeing Raven so happy, open and as carefree as she ever gets. It was nice. Water is good. Sun is bad (I got burnt... I knew before I left I'd get burnt... I always burn... grr.... yes I did use sunscreen) and food is good too. The Kung Fu people were nice. Susie's parents are great fun. The location was beautiful and the weather was good - not too hot or too cold.     &nbsp;   I spent the night at her house. I'm not going to see my Susie again until August... that may not sound like a long time but imagine:     &nbsp;   a) having to have a growth detached from your hip    b) having to use half brain-power until then 'cause you share a mind    c) being pathetically lonely because you don't really have any other friends that you can just do anything with at any time regardless of mood     &nbsp;   I mean, I do have Raven but she volunteers in the summer all day at a kids Summer camp. One can also cannot take Raven at any time 'cause she has... special moods.... and isn't always compatible with mine. It's hard to explain but Raven's friendship is just that much more work. It's good work and I love her, but it is sometimes work.     &nbsp;   I have nothing to do today. I didn't fall asleep till like 3:00 at Susie's and we had to get up at 10:30 to get to her orthodontist. I then had to walk home from her orthodontist which is a lot farther than I would have liked to walk (it took like an hour). Ergo, I am too tired to edit. That's ok, I have 5 days Susie free (ie distraction free) to edit before I go to debate camp. I'm kinda grouchy too, I know I was kinda curt to Chelsea over lunch... Maybe I'll go read. That's low brain power and should make me feel better. It'll get my mind of lack of Susie anyhow.     &nbsp;   And I spent the first 10 days of July in Ontario!!

       I'm getting way to into research for our book. I spent a long time the other day reading about blackwork emroidery and elizibethan sumptuary laws. Just now I found myself reading more about blackwork and a little bit on corsets. Why corsets you ask? Well though the characters don't wear them in their common activities, it is very much something that crazy Edmund would make Laleena wear.  Sigh , we're not even edditing that part yet and I think to look up appropriate undergarment. Meanwhile Fraser is a sailor and we know very little about modern day nautical crap let alone whatever kind of ship our little guy would use.     &nbsp;  I'm going to cultus lake today. I'm going to be bitten by mosquitos today. Those two things I am sure of. Where I'm sleeping tonight I'm still not sure.... either my house or Susie's. That I don't know doesn't really bother me so I suppose that's alright.     &nbsp;  I suppose I should go groom. Susie is coming to pick me up in just over half an hour from now. Raven's coming too. So are a bunch of Susie's kung fu people that I know but oh well, I should still have fun!    &nbsp;  PS - I only messed with the color to appease Susie... I don't know if I can get used to this multi-coloured blog thing

      Today I have done... not much. Tragic&nbsp;I suppose. I know there are people out there (ie Susie) who revel in having nothing to do. I prefer to be out doing stuff or at the very least  in  doing stuff. I wrote a page today but then I stopped because I don't think I was a very good page. It may be just that I was being to critical of it and wasn't in a very write-friendly mood so I'll put it aside for a couple hours then go look at it again. It may be a perfectly fine page, or it may really be bad in which case I am not impressed 'cause I'll have to re-write it.  &nbsp;  I cleaned the bathroom. We all love chores.  &nbsp;  I was supposed to go to the mall today with Raven to help her buy a swimsuit but apparently her mom decided that she didn't need my help and it was to be a mother daughter bonding experience or something. Personally I 'd rather bond with an activated chainsaw than Raven's mother buy hey, that's just me.  &nbsp;  My parents will be home soon. When that happens it becomes "family game night". Joy o' joys. I don't mind games that make you think. I rather like Trivia Pursuit, TriBond and Malarky. I can live with Disney Trivia, Boggle and Outburst. I detest games like Sorry, Monopoly, Trouble, Life and PayDay. We  always  end up playing at least one of those last mentioned. And that only dents our game collection. We just got a new one called Things that we're gonna try out tonight. I hope its fun, I really do.  &nbsp;  I think Chelsea is feeling neglected. Perhaps I'll go play nintendo. She has this sick fascination with watching me (or others) playing nintendo games but she doesn't like to play them herself. Odd.

      I made five pages tonight. Five brand spankin' new pages. These weren't edited as none of what happened was in the original manuscript. Well, some of the story was the same but told in an entirely different manner. Laleena learned Marmee's story from the embroidery Mistress. The embroidery mistress didn't even exist in the original so it really was new. I also had to research embroidery because I know nothing about it. We figured, (Susie and I) that Laleena's work would probably resemble the medieval style of embroidery so I learned more than I ever wanted to know about blackwork. Ok, I learned more than I ever wanted to know about blackwork  and  I learned what blackwork was.  &nbsp;  Five pages is a good deal of writing. Plus research and editorial cross-referencing, I did a lot of work today. I turned the computer off for the night (not this one obviously, I write on the computer in my bedroom) and my fingers are sore. So I come to blog. I am either masochistic to my poor finger joints or I am somewhat obsessive about my blog. I also ate and watched about twenty minutes of the Hunchback of Notre Dame. That about covers my evening. It felt good to make pages. I haven't done that for quite a while.  &nbsp;  The editing is all out of whack 'cause I was in Ontario and Susie is leaving for Calgary next week. She did chapters 13/14 and we're kinda splitting 15. I'll probably do 16 while she's away then she can do 17/18 while I'm at Debate camp. I leave the day she comes back form Calgary, probably before she actually gets home.  &nbsp;  Now my wrists hurt. And my forearms are starting to complain. They don't deserve this. Especially because I'll likely be abusing them tomorrow too. I guess I'll let them rest for the night.

      Not since the 28th of June have I had a free day. Well here I am. I woke up at 1:15... blissful. Papa just got here... grr that makes the house much louder. Soon I will edit 'till my heart's content. Then I'll read. Maybe I'll walk the dog to the creek. He loves that.  &nbsp; I was just looking at my debatecamp's website. It looks like so much nerd filled fun! Once they teach us the finer points of impromptu speaking there will be random competitions - at meal time, on the bus, during recreation times. I can develope a speach that I can then use at any competition throughout the year (ie provincials).  &nbsp; Mom is nagging that I am to help her. I don't know how. I am afraid. She put a Mom and Bethy day on the calendar. We haven't had one of them since I was like 11 so that's a good sign. It's for world trade centre's rememberance day.... sept 11 but that's what it says on my calander. As always the day is a surprise but it is just the two of us and we should have tonnes of fun. I think she is still looking for a job for me to do. Here it is... bye,

      I am happy to report that the party was an all around success. The "children" behaved (they were many of them going into grade 10 - ie two years younger, but it was a childrens themed party remember? so they are children.) Cate was happy to see that we were able to get an old friend to drop by. He graduated with her last year and haven't seen eachother since. They enjoyed eachother's company.   We had fewer people than we had origonally intended. This means we couldn't have a clown. But that was ok. We had to improvise and throw in an extra game 'cause we had too much time. We made too much food. 3 dozen hotdogs didn't feel like much when there were going to be 20 people but when we only had 12 and were all munching on chips all day, it was way too much. The cake was good although a little sweet. Sugar is never an issue for me. You can never have something "too" sweet. Other people weren't able to finish one piece. I loved it!   After the party Raven and I spent the night at Susie's. We had a water fight where we got more wet filling up the water balloons than throwing them at eachother. We watched Origonal Sin to contrast all the childish festivities. That is one sexy film. The most disturbing part of the night was observing some self mutilation that was worse than I'd expected on the birthday girl. I wont dwell but it scared me good.   I now don't know what to do. I feel like writing (editing actually, but I have to change a bunch of stuff and is more like writing an origonal). I don't know if I am awake enough for that. The idea of edditing is to get rid of the not-so-good stuff and repalce it with hopefully-much-better stuff. You don't get those kind of results if you're too tired when you write. Maybe I'll write notes. I've never done that before but it may be an idea.   Perhaps I will clean my room. Hahhahahahah.... yeah right. I should. But I probably wont. Mom's asleep or else I would watch a movie... she's asleep in the living room. I'll likely read. Or surf the net for random entertainment. In any case, I'll go do something now. bye.

      I just spent the last four hours making a donkey. A donkey without a tail. Then I made 12 tails. All this for Raven's party tommorrow where it's a children's theme so we're going to have pin the tail on the donkey... and musical chairs, and hot potatoe, and a jello eating contest. We'll eat hotdogs and listen to Fred Penner, Rafe and Mickey Mouse's "fun songs". Susan spent the night last night. Rather spontaneous of us. We paper mached all night to make the pinata. Oy.   I just feel a desire to rave about the book I finnished somewhere over Saskatchewan the other day. It's called the Daughter of the Forest and it is by Juliet Marillier (see side collumn). I picked it up at the used book store before leaving 'cause I remembered seeing it's sequel in the book store. The third of the trilogy is called Child of the Prophesy which is what Susan and I were considering for a while calling our own book. This is a brilliantly written fantasy novel about a girl named Sorcha who has to save her six older brothers from a curse. She has to finnish a practically impossible task and she cannot speak, nor tell of her plight with any form of writing or guestures. There comes to be a beautiful love story and plenty of adventure. There is also a lot of tradgedy and I cried more than once. As the protagonist (written in first person) is unable to speak, it places an added challenge to the author and it is taken care of beautifully. This is a book that I highly reccomend, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Juliet Marillier is one of Tor's Women in Fantasy as is author Jacqueline Carey, my role model and aspiration. Brilliant book - go read it.   I have to go do dishes now. I hate dishes. I REALLY need a dishwasher. Sigh. Ta ta.

      Ten whole days away. First was Canada Day in Ottawa... woah lots of people. It was frigging halarious to see 200 000 people flee the rain. In a sudden down pour people fled to hotels, stores, wherever... then there was hail.... and thunder... wicked wind... lightning bouncing down the street. Were were across the street from our hotel and there was so much rain we couldn't see it. It was a low grade tornado. Fireworks were nice.   In Toronto we took in theatre. Mama Mia was tonnes of fun. Kinda weak on plot but really, its based on ABBA music... what do you expect? The Producers was funny. It was all typical Mel Brookes humour though and I prefer a more intelligent sort of laugh. In all I reccomend Mama Mia for great fun - it was one of those plays that reminded me why I simply adore adore musical theatre.   Niagara Falls were beautiful. We rode the Maid of the Mist which is a little boat that takes you right to the falls. It was inspriring. It is something to pull from while writing and something hard to articulate in words. Aside from the water falls themselves, Niagara Falls is the tackiest place on Earth. Susie would adore it.   Next came the family visit which wasn't too bad. The first hour was physically painful with only Gramma and Grandpa (named Elwood and Vera with personalities to match) where they spoke exclusivly about tomatoes and cows. Gee I love farm country. We went to Sports World which is quite decieveing as it has virtually nothing to do with sports and we did mini golf and fair type games. My sister and I both won stuff. Yay! There was a story book family picknic complete with over 60 people, children playing, a 97 year old great grandmother, hotdogs, hamburgers, a big red barn and cows mooing in the bak round. Sickening. Really sickeningly sweet. I got devoured that night. That farm has a frigging mosquito mofia. They attack strategically. I only got bitten on my legs. Which is really really really wierd. LAst count I had 18 bites on my legs at least 6 of which are MASSIVE. The mosquitoes showed up just past dusk as normal. Ten minutes late I fled to the house. 18 bites in one location in ten minutes including bites the size of my hand. I have been eated much worse in the past but these bugs were just creepy in their almost calculated plan of attack. Maybe I'm a little paranoid.   So much more to say of trip but that will suffice for now. I have to go phone my Susie who I missed so very much and thought of often. I got her a present *grin*.

       Today was a better day at Science World. I was kept very busy, mostly with disfunctional motorized cars that they built. One of the kids there told me that his great-great-uncle, Vee Scholms or something like that, was the guy that played the little old Rabbi in the Fiddler on the Roof movie. That's awsome, I love that movie! He was in the broadway show too. We did pictionary o' science in the science olympics, one kid had to draw a simple machine (you know, lever, pulley, screw etc) and he drew a toaster. It was so cute.       I am kinda sad that I haven't had any comments here for a long long time. I still love you people. Talk to me!      I really have to have a shower. I've been putting it off 'cause I've been so tired. But I will tonight. Tommorrow just isn't an option.       I e-mailed the science world lady to tell her that I have to miss two days next week to re-write some provincials. I hope she doesn't get too ticked. I also hope it doesn't reflect on my grade...      Off to shower now. I am incredably hot. More hot then I was today at the "Science Olympics" and that was outside during the day. I am not amused. Time to cool.      Yesterday's edit: 0 pages.

       Really busy today. I spent almost fourteen hours with Susie today and there was no sleepover involved! Teen Choice awards were nice (I love awards shows) but I missed the part with the O.C.!      I really should get ready for bed. Told ya it was quick.      Yesterday's edit: fine tuning of 15 pages!

       Today wasn't quite as dull. I was given more oppertunity to amuse myself. I honestly don't know if the leader people like me or not. I saw Adventures of the Coral Reef, also know as (exclusively by me,) as The Fijiian Who Could. It was very nice. We also played with a slimy hag fish, and disected a shark. Tommorrow, joy o' joys, is spy day. We'll do the James bond exhibit and there will be a fake crime with real police. Sounds not too fun, but oh well.       Mom's at bingo, dad's at work. That makes this the ideal edit/study time. I am friggin determined to get through it all. Well, all the Laleena... all fifteen pages of Laleena! I only hvae to get rid of Papa.       I'm approaching hungry. We get buritos for dinner. Yippee.       Yesterday's edit: 0 pages

      When I was just finshing up with the work experience, I was all gung ho to get home and fine tune the editing that is essentially done. Instead I watched three hours of much more music. I then ate, did the dishes, and watched a random sitcom, Two and a half Men. So much for being productive.  Perhaps it was my utter lack of productivity all day that did it. There was this illusion of being busy produced by being awake at 6am and spending 8 and a half hours signed in as voulunteer staff at a summer camp for eleven and twelve year olds. Tomorrow I get to watch a movie about the coral reef. You have no idea how excited that makes me. It is sooo sad.  If it is any warmer than it was today, I will have to supress a need to dive into false creek. Any readers in the GVRD would know that it is indeed a poorly formed idea to even consider submerging ones self in false creek. Ewww. Am I tired? Well, yeah. Am I sleepy? Not particualrily. That will get much better once I am in the dark on a comfy bed. I am most sure of this.  I am already considering what to eat for breakfast. That too is sad. Even more pathetic, I can't come up with anything. I ate the last of the eggos today. damn. Well then, nighty night. Gosh its early to be going to bed.

       Today I began a lovely component of the public education graduation program, know as "Work Experience". In principal it is a great idea: Give students a chance to have a go at a realife work world while still in high school. This however, is not exactly the case.       Today I was at Science World, doing work experience at the summer camp. They do not pay people to do the mindless labour I performed. No job would require such... nothing. I escorted 6 groups of kids to the bathroom. I wheeled a tv to a staff room. I cut fabric into four strips. I took pictures. And I generally made sure that the kids were ok. And I had a partner... in case I couldn't handle it on my own. The sickening part? They're on half staff this week 'cause there's a teacher camp happening this week too - last week there were  three  volunteers (me) per room.       Its not like I had a bad time. I wasn't bored  all  the time. I was even happy to help when I could. But I can't help but have the feeling that I didn't really do anything to help. Camp would have functioned just fine without me. The utter pointlessness is astounding. God forbid they give us actual experience.       Susie was very tired (she was there too but in the "explorers" group, I was in the "navigators" group) and actually fell asleep on me on the skytrain. It was so cute.       I had my first "booster Juice" today was thrilled that they didn't put any grass in my smoothie. Its just weird. My smoothie, the grass free kind, was very good.       Lots more to say but minimal desire to type. I'll come back later.      Yesterday's edit: 1 page (thank god!!)

       Finished 1984 about 45 minutes ago. I was going to have it done before I went to sleep but unfortunatly, I was having great difficulty keeping my eyes open - when they were open it was often too fuzzy to see any words. Boring books are not the greatest reads when one is tired.  So why don't I like it? It is a classic afterall. I've heard great things about it from all kinds of people. "Of all the classics you read in school, 1984 is the only one I've liked." I have heard things like that many many times. I think that it is likely the only one they've ever understood. One does not need an astounding IQ to get this novel. And that is my primary complaint. Mr Orwell would have been well off paying extra attention to "subtlety" in english class. Could his messages of been any more obvious? Its all about freedoms and government and humanity and a pessimistic view on the future. You've pretty much got that covered in the first 50 pages. The following 250, though perhaps better written, are rather superfulous.       Furtherly, it is dull. It takes a sickeningly long time for the reader to attatch any sort of emotion to any of the main characters. I do think this was done, in part, on purpose, illustrating the kind of people that live in that society. However, I don't know if Orwell anticipated the brutality that would see to his story. It takes a bloodly long time to care whether Winston, Julia or anyone else is obliterated by Big Brother and the gang.       That, and I hate the ending. I am an optimist. Furtherly, I am a romantic. The ending is as polar from those two of my steadfast personas as possible. Why couldn't it end suedo-happily? couldn't the romance have even worked? Gargh.      I had frosted miniwheats. They helped.      Yesterday's edit: 0 pages.

       Today I had three main goals.       Goal 1) Finish 1984   Goal 2) Clean bathroom for allowance   Goal 3) Watch tomb raider      The goals were in that order, from most to least important. First I did the bathroom. I proceeded to watch tomb raider which I thought was, while not a piece of cinematric masterpiece, had some decent acting and was amusing as well as exciting. I am quite interested in seeing the sequel. We then ate and... poof! It's family game night. We just finnished playing games. We played Life, Outburst, Sorry, and Trivia Persuit genus 5. I won my least favorite, Sorry. I hate that game.       That means it is one o'clock in the morning and I still have 60 pages of one of the most dull books ever written to complete. I am not an unitelligent person. Usually people who dislike classic literature fail to understand it. Trust me, I get this one. I simply think it is poorly written. I'll rant about Orwell's style later. Do I want to read this? No. Will I read this? Sigh, yes.       Tommorrow I get to do homework. FYI, it really is August. And I do homework. Gargh. I didn't sign up for summer school I swear! Ooh, I'm bleeding. Wonder how that happened.       Time. To. Read. Now. Really. Must. Go.

       Good morning... afternoon....      I just woke up. Susie  just  woke up (I've been awake about half an hour, Susie, like 12 seconds) I know this because natuarally, she spent the night. We spent five hours last night cleaning my room. It now looks like a tornado hit it. Very tragic because believe it or not, it is actually cleaner now than it was before. We got rid of five garbage bags. Thats alot of garbage.       I still have to do the top of the dresser, the desk and the shelf. Well, and the floor. We stayed up until 5:00 playing tetris and using our stunning skills of intelligent conversation.... hmm... questionable.       If anyone reading this happens to know Laurell K Hamilton, tell her to post! Please.       I'm hungry.      Yesterday's edit: 0 pages.

      Today, so far, my mom has shown no sign of being mad at me. Normally, this is a given, but this week, she's been nuts. I just read 53 pages of 1984. It only took like an hour but oh god, did it feel like longer. I am not much a fan of that book.  I watched a really long movie last night. That's why I was up so late. It was called At Play in the Field of The Lord. It was three and a half hours long. When it started I thought it was typical two hour movie.... two hours later I'd seen enough that I didn't want to give up, but probably wouldn't have watched it if I'd known it was that long. It was pretty good.... but too long.  I don't really have anything else of interest to say. I came on the computer to get away from 1984.  Yesterday's edit: 0 pages.

      Well, my mom came home. That's good. She was at lunch with an old friend from H&R block. She was at lunch from 11:00 until 5:30. That's one hell of a lunch.  I missed out on seeing The Village and shopping with Raven and Alex. That sucks. I would have liked to have gone. Mother seemed rather displeased that I didn't really do anything all day. She didn't appreciate that I squandered my day on the telephone. I "obviously don't understand the work that has to go into cleaning my bedroom" and that with Chelsea's, they "literally worked 24/7". I doubt that. I do expect they slept. Perhaps 12/7 or even 10/7... acutually it would have been 10/6. Anywho, I have a month. I am not approaching panic yet.  Bedroom. Think dresser - ugly, rectangualar, large, white wooden dresser. Think what has to be done to fit it into a romantic gothic room. Think a mother who seems pretty set on keeping it white. That complicates that whole gothic thing. White aint too gothic.  But , we did come up with something I kinda like (I would prefer if it weren't white....) I get the cast iron drawer handles from Ikea (or somewhere else ie home depot).They go in the middle of each drawer. There is then a black rectangle put around the handle in a boarder type fashion. This is to be made out of decorating tape. A table runner (or long rectangular cloth) is put over the dresser. Runner is black. Poof, white dresser turns semi-gothic. I think the runner should be black lace. I think it will fit the theme. Mom seems to think everyone associates black lace with old Portugeuse women. Odd I think. I could also live with black satin, as that would go with the black satin pillows I am quite determined to accquire.  I really want to finish 1984 tommorrow. I probably won't, but dammit I'll try. Note - I can't read while on the phone. I love ya Susie, but let's keep it brief, Orwell calls. I want to be done the entire 1984 project, reading/writing and all, by the end of the weekend. Sounds like fun. Or not.  I'm getting sorta tired and I want to read before bed. Big brother is watching me.  Yesterday's edit: 0 pages.

      I just woke up. I'm home alone. I know Dad's at work, and Chelsea's at SFU day camp.... but where's my mom? She left no note, didn't say she was going out....  I guess I'll have some breakfast.

       For an ample summary of my day, see   urlLink  Susie's blog   . I would write about it, but too much stuff hapened after that I must discuss.       Beige is out. My mom hates it. There is only so much I can fight her on, and she hates the beige. She'd rather I do red. Which, I am alright with except she is  insisting  that I incorporate white into the room. I was going for romantic gothic - with the cast iron bed, matching side table, red walls(or beige), super duper chandalire that susie will get me for xmas, and my funkarific shelving unit. Fist off, mother vetoed the shelves. She said they were too expensive then went into to a tangent about how I am expecting too much, how Chelsea seemed more grateful, and how I have an "interesting theory of money". First, I wasnt' here when Chelsea's was done so I didn't have any boundries with what to do. I started with what I wanted and went from there. Second, I  am  grateful and hate being compared to Chelsea the nonchalant. Third, if I had any real amount of money I may have a better understanding of its nuances.       She then went on to say that none of this furniture is leaving with me. I leave this home with what I entered it - nothing. I get my personal belongings and any furnature that they (including Chelsea) don't want. This pissed me off as I thought when I got gifts, they were for me. I guess not.        ANYWAYS , I can't get the shelving so I'm stuck with the dresser/book shelf. I want to paint them. Mom says dresser fine, but the book shelf can't be painted. Not she won't paint it, that it cannot physically be done. I find it hard to believe that there is no paint made on Earth that will suffice to paint my book shelf. Should I argue it? I don't think I care to as it won't be leaving with my anyways. Should I buy the shelves myself? No, because I won't matter once she's put white in there.       Basically, my mom is designing my room, based roughly on what kind of coulors I want. I told her "mild yen" but she looked at me funny. Then I tried "Romantic Gothic" which is what I want but not nearly as morbid as it sounds. She didn't like that phrase either. She thinks "desert". I made her unthink that. Its gonna be a loooong month.       Will the room look good? Yes, I am confident it will. Will it look how I envision it (ie my dream room)? No. That just encourages me to move out sooner. Though she has her sick hook there where she will only pay for university for as long as I live at home. Gargh.       Full of frustrated teen angst. Today I have laughed, cried and wanted to scream.       I love Susan. She gave me moose, she gave me hug, she gave me love and support and didn't question much of my vision. She was helpful and encouraging and wants me to have the room I want. Though mom isn't officially mad at me anymore, it isn't exactly an "I love bethie zone".      Yesterday's edit: 0 pages. (None today either but intend to tommorow)

      Well... my bed is now... gone. At like 7:30 a lady called about my bunk bed and came to see it ten mins later. I then had to take it all apart and she came to pick it up at 9:30. I no longer have a bed. I get to sleep on a mattress on the floor for like three weeks till we get my new bed. I wasn't really ready for it to go. I was hoping for a "one last night to say goodbye" before it left me. I've had this bed for 9 years. There is a little bit of attachment there. It served me well. I will miss it.... only until I get my great new one... but I've got a good three weeks to mourn it.  I am still uber-stressed about those exam marks. Whenever I consider them I am put into instant panic mode. I can rewrite and I will get the better of the two marks. The only problem is that the rewrites take place while I should be volunteering at Science World. My other option is to rewrite in November when I have a chance to grab a copy of the text books... but then my mom will have to find out. If I'm careful I could rewrite in August and not have my mom know. It would be incredably sneaky but it could work.  On the bright side, my mom is now speaking to me. My peacekeeping bingo dabbers I bought her (one has Dagwood, the other Blondie, for Dad and Mom respectivly) while pathetically wandering Brentwood, must have worked to my advantage. I also went to the library for her and got her four books. Of them she has read two, maybe three. It has gotten to the point for me that I have read pretty much most of the books I am interested in there (I mean pleasure fluff reading, there is plenty of intelligent stuff I've yet to get around to).  I am really looking forward to my adventure tommorow. I get to plan my room by going to three, yes three different home furnishing stores. I get to have breakfast for a dollar. I get moose. I get out of the house. I get to have my mind off provincial marks. And most importantly...  I GET TO SEE SUSIE!!  Yay!  I have to go clear a spot on my floor so I can put down my mattress. Yipee.

      I just (well, this morning), popped on to the ministry of education's website to see if my exam results were posted. They were. And they are not good.  For English Literature, the class that I ended up with 92% in, the class where I never got anything lower than 90%, where the teacher says that her student's exam marks are usually withing three or four percent of their final marks, I got 76%.  For History, a class where I averaged at about 88% and studied like hell for the exam, I got 72%.  Seeing these marks I felt physically ill. These get put onto the transcripts that determine what university I go to and what kind of scholarships I get. I was actually feeling nausa. I e-mail the volunteer coordinator to say that I'm ill and can't come in today. I don't want to be at home when my mom comes home, becuase I still don't know if she's still mad at me or not so I go out. I take the skytrain to Brentwood and wander around for a while. I buy my parents bingo dabbers as a peace offering and buy myself a moolate from Dairyqueen to make me feel better. I went to the library on my way home to pick up books for my bookless parents. I come home.  On the way home I start to panic that my mom will have found out that I didn't volunteer today, much the same as the time I skipped half a day of school to go to the postoffice and an overactive imagination got the better of me. Fortunatly when I come home, she still isn't here.  I'm gonna have to tell her the marks eventually. Oh god. She will not like that much. Apparently I can re-write them if I register before friday. I donno if I get the better of the two marks or if I get stuck with the seccond mark. In all honesty, I thought I did well on the exams. Now, after a month of not looking at the stuff, without my texts books, could I do any better?  There is no way I'm telling her before tommorow night. I'm looking forward to my home furnishings shopping and I don't want to be forbidden to go.  Sigh. Tear.

       God I love being home alone. It doesn't happen often for usually when I refer to being home alone, I'm actually not because Chelsea is there. Right now I am truly home alone.       Its raining. Or at least it was ten minutes ago... I can't tell if it still is from here. Yay for the trees, the grass, little birdies and such. Pitty the tourists, the campers, those who have to be out and about. I actually like the rain. I was just getting used to the wet coast not being so wet so this kinda throws me off guard. I have to volunteer at the hospital today and I don't know if I should be rejoicing that I won't get too hot, or cursing that I'll get damp.      As of when I went to bed last night (at like 10:30) my mom was still nursing her moral wounds I cleaved into her soul. I didn't see her this morning. I hope by the time we all come home she's over it. I really do.       I get to see my Susie tommorow!! I haven't seen her since before she went to Calgary. Yipee! Yeah, I've spoken to her, but now I get to see her in the flesh and revel in the joys of a Susie hug. We're gonna go to Ikea bright and early (as in we're eating breakfast there) we may wander over to linens n' things and then we'll go to home sense. So many home furnishing stores!! All to look at stuff for my room.       I'm gonna go eat. Then I may edit. I can't actually believe I'm up this early.       Yeaterday's edit: 0 pages. (Gee, this edit log is working. It makes me feel mucho guilty to write that!)

      Nope, she didn't sleep it off. Addmittedly she was only asleep for half an hour. I in the end decided it may be better for me to do a subtle suck up that rather than the conversation o' death but it hasn't worked yet. We're both going out tommorrow so by the time she comes home it should be better.  Yes, actually I was  very  tired at the time. I hadn't really factored it into my level of sin, but now that you mention it... I had just gotten home form camp. Camp tired me out way more than Ontario did, including the time change!  I just don't understand how she holds a grudge over something I find so petty. I think it is really a difference in our moral makeup or soemthing that makes her take these things so personally. What really gets me, I am not allowed to get angry at her. No, if I do that, I get in trouble. Double standards is usually Susie's pet peeve (I get stereotypes) but I'm borrowing it for the evening. If I were acting like this for the same reason, I would so be in trouble. In fact, I would be called on having an "attitude", ie stereotype, when she is displaying more "attitude" than I usually do. It is so bloody frustrating.  I am not one to get angry at people. I do not retain anger well. If something pisses me off, I am  maybe  angry until the end of the night... something has to be pretty drastic to elicit this kind of response out of me. Gargh.  As per the beds... Susie is now torn between the Ikea bed and the Sears bed too! They are both genuinly great beds!! I have to somehow sell the old one first though. I put posters up. White metal twin over full bunk bed in near new condition only $60. She said to put sixty so they can bargin us down to fifty.  I'm gonna make it an early night to avoid the wrath. It's also time to read more of 1984. Tommorrow, after I come home and hopefuly before mother ges home I'll have time to edit.

      My mother is in an extremely foul mood. Last night I "bit off her head" when she tried to say something. Basically I interupted her. Yes, it was rude, yes it probably really annoyed her. I said sorry right away but she mustn't have believed me 'cause since she got home she hasn't said a word to me. It is quite childish actually. I was sitting right under the light switch and she asked Chelsea to turn it on. Thinking she'd gotten over my slight to her last night, I asked why she wasn't very talkative and she said "Well I'm not in much of a mood to talk when every time I try to say something my head gets bitten off!" and walks out of the room.  If she had done the same to me I would have been annoyed and slightly ticked, maybe for the rest of the night. It's been almost 24 hours for goodness sakes! I was rude, not criminal! She takes things like this waaay out of proportion. It makes me feel like crap, and gives me a miserable night. I don't think one rude comment mortally wounded the essence of her soul. She acts like it has.  Argh. She's fallen asleep on the couch. If she's still tickish when she wakes up I'll have to appologise again which will lead to a conversation about how I am a dispicable being, how I never concern myself with her feelings, and will likely end up with me in tears feeling even more like crap.  Susie, if you read this, please refrain from phoning tonight.  I hate feeling like crap. Time to go... feel like crap.

      When I got home from Camp, Chelsea's bedroom had been completely re-done. She had her walls painted, got a new duvet plus duvet cover and sheets. She got shelves and a new lamp. It looks awsome. It is her early Christmas preasant. And guess what?? I get to do mine too!  I can get a new bed if it is also my birthday pressie. Check out this  urlLink bed from ikea  it is my dream bed. And I can get it!! This is the  urlLink desk  that I got for christmas. I am as of yet unsure what color to do the room, but I want it to go with the bed. I'm thinking elegant. My old bed was similar to  urlLink this one .  By the way, if anyone knows how to stick pictures in the blog let me know. This whole hyperlink thing is getting old.  Yesterday's edit: 0 pages (just got home, bare with me)

      I just opened up a Jones soda and its cap said: Your mind being creative and original will make you famous. I will take it as a sign. Avatar's Crown will make us famous!!  Hehehe....  Anyways I'M HOME!!! And happy to be here. Though I was finally making some new friends, I was missing my olds ones terribly. Afterall, one is silver and the other's gold. (Guide song). I learned  so  much about debating. Here we go, a day-by-day account. This will take a while.   July 25 Sunday  Took the ferry to Victoria. I followed a nice looking girl named Lindsay because I didn't know anyone. She was nice and ended up being one of my favorite people there. We finally get to camp and we're brought to the residence. It's called Lake house but we called it the Res. It was nice. There were names on the door so I was expecting a roommate named Sephra (Great name eh? Gotta remember that one) but she wasn't there yet. We went for dinner where we were split into four teams. There were only 29 of us total and I was put onto Sparta with (I'll name them 'cause I'll mention them a lot) Sephra, Safyia, Kasha, Austin, Dylan and Duncan. Our counselor was Jo (Joanne) from University of Toronto. We went to make a Sparta banner, slogan, history ect then had snack and went to bed. My room mate ended up changing rooms and I was alone.    July 26 Monday  Wake up at 7am. Breakfast at 8. After that we have a show debate and watch cousellors Jo (U of T, 19 years old, female - my counselor), Teddy (UBC, 19 years old, male, genuinely the nicest guy ever), Greg (UBC, 25ish, uber-nice, northamerican champion) and Ren (Andrew Rennihan, McGill, 22ish, very funny, northamerican champion) all yell at eachother. We then had a group session on the basics of debate. Swim time then lunch. We played Bend your head, a trivia game about current events, Canadian history, history of language and speech and debate. Another debate session and a swim (we swam everyday from 11:30 - 12:30 and 4:30 - 5:30. I only swam a couple times, I usually sat on the dock and talked). Dinner. Debate idol auditions. I auditioned but didn't get in. They voted for Sean, an arrogant grade 9 who used some clever puns. I wasn't pleased. Then was a scavenger hunt where we had to find a buch of stuff ranging from a pine cone that looked like a celebrity to Jo's boyfriend. We didn't actually find out which counselor was Jo's boyfriend till the last night. It was driving me crazy. Sparta won the hunt. Bed.    July 27 Tuesday  Breakfast. Show debate of Sean and Austin vs Greg and Ren. Check out what I said about these people above to see how well that went. Needless to say the counselors kicked their ass severely. Free time, swim, lunch. Bend your head again, and we came last. We split into groups and did one of those "You have crashed on a deserted island. Group A has lots, B little, and C nothing. What do you do?" activities. My group actually agreed on this semi communism thing which was kinda odd. We then discussed how it parallels real life. Group debate activity. Swim, dinner. Debate idol audition (I couldn't audition twice) Session on After dinner speaking, and session on world issues. Another scavenger hunt, one where you follow clues to a destination (which was the witch who stole our camp shirts). Sparta won but we had to run across camp for 14 clues and I got a monster ugly painful blister. We put the witch on trial and threw him in the lake.The session, by the way, taught us about Refugees, sovereignty, and Food security. Snack. Exhausted and in pain, I collapse into bed.    July 28 Wednesday  Up, Breakfast. Workshop on drama improv and monologues. Played games and such. Swim, lunch. Bend your head. Model Parliament where we had to put through a bill in a parliamentary style. Great session on rebuttal and questions and note taking. Swim, dinner. Debate idol audition. Session on Persuasive speaking from a local coach. We had optional sessions that I attended about university life and women in debate (apparently there is a measure of sexism in university debate) by Jo and Teddy. They were wonderful. We went on a long walk where we ended up sititng in a big circle talking while Ren and Greg played the guitar.    July 29 Thursday  Up at 7:45 ooh ahhh we ate breakfast in pajamas. Super session on Advanced strategies that only the most advanced among us got. It was amazing. We were in there for two and a half hours and went right through swim time. Lunch, bend your head (Sparta got negative points!!). We then had the afternoon to prep our debates for the next day (This house believes that the international monetary fund should not impose political condions on aid) and our individual event (either a persuasive speech, an after dinner speech, an impromptu speech or a dramatic monologue). My partner for debate was Katie from Calgary. She was very nice and will be at the UBC debate tourny this year. Water balloon fight, swim (but I went to the computer room to work), dinner. Debate idol wild card round. I am brought back and do a wonderfully funny speech during which there were people literally rolling on the ground and crying from laughter. Literally. I win the wild card. We get some free time then there is the debate idol finals in which I have to debate parli style  backwards . It was hilarious. It started with the judges comments and based on what they said I did, I had to act accordingly. For example, I had to end every sentence with Sis Boom Bah. It was bloody hilarious and winner is announced next day. Snack, then bed.    July 30 Friday  Up, breakfast. We have two rounds of debate each for the tournament. After the second round when one guy I debated asked how it went, he answered that if he was needed, he'd be in the corner, in the fetal position, quivering. Hehehe... I really wasn't  that  mean to the poor guy! The debates were really fun, and we got to use all our new skills. Lunch. Then there was the individual event competition. I did a persuasive about antisocial personality disorder, but it wasn't very good. I heard a couple very good ones though. We then had a two hour swim that actually involved almost every sitting on the dock. I was in one of the two circles discussing writing and fantasy books, then dreams. Dinner was a toga party (sticking with the Greek theme in our names). They awarded the prizes. I got top debate speaker from the rounds, top team from the rounds as well and I was awarded the debate idol!!! Super awesome. Then we went to Victoria to say monologues at the pier ( I didn't do one) and we then wandered the city at night for a while, dancing with some street performers and going for coffee. Finally back to camp, and asleep.    July 31 Saturday  We had to go home! Out of camp by 9 am. Breakky and out. We had to split into two busses going to the different ferry terminals, and my bus dropped people at the airport. We catch the ferry. Home. Family took my to Steveston for linner (lunch + dinner) and I got home around 7pm.   That really was nothing more than an account of what we did. It says not much about the people, the funny stories, or the great thigns I learned. All these things I imagin I'll talk about eventually. For now, I think I'll stop as this is a very long blog.
