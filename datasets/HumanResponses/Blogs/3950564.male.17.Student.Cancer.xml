      Well today was my first day of college visits, and it took me to Cleveland, Vickie's hometown.&nbsp; I went to John Carroll University and Case Western Reserve University, I am not a big fan of Cleveland. . .&nbsp; But both campuses are very "unwired" and full of the latest WIFI technology, which is great.&nbsp; Case, well. . . its a huge campus&nbsp;and a very&nbsp;prestigious school that is willing to give me lots of money which is always a good thing.&nbsp; And, Case has this special turbo super fast internet.&nbsp; The one thing I dont like about Case is&nbsp;the dorms; the dorms are very small and scary looking which is a major factor in my college decision.&nbsp; JSU has slightly bigger dorms with carpet and the bathrooms looked alot cleaner.&nbsp; Also the campus of JCU&nbsp;is more centralized and is&nbsp;easier accessed&nbsp;by these cool underground tunnel hallways.&nbsp; (Plus they have a pool, and big exercise room, and better food)&nbsp; As of now I couldn't tell you what college I want to go too but I am going t0 major in Biology, hoping to eventually go into Microbiology.&nbsp; This summer is still ripe for lots of college visits which will hopefully take me to Miami, Kenyon, and maybe Ohio Northern, also I am going to try to get to some out of state colleges.&nbsp; Also today I got out of the Republican Club that Alex has started. . . and I wasn't glad about that, hahaha, yeah right.&nbsp; But I still want to keep going, for the campaigning part.&nbsp; O well, there are more colleges to research on Princton Review, update later, maybe.

      I got it...  Its a 3.&nbsp; I am really extreamly disappointed in myself and feel as if I let Dr. Patterson and myself down.&nbsp; I am not ashamed to admit it,&nbsp;I did cry when I saw it and now&nbsp;I feel&nbsp;really crappy.&nbsp; I am just so mad at myself because I did so bad, and I would like to thank everyone for there support.&nbsp; After about&nbsp;half an hour reflecting on my score and how I let&nbsp;myself down with my 3, I went outside and started a fire in our burning pit.&nbsp; After it got&nbsp;to a&nbsp;big enough&nbsp;size, I gathered&nbsp;up all my AP notebooks that I had used for the text and threw them&nbsp;in, following with my notecards.&nbsp; Watching them burn cheered me up quite a bit.&nbsp; Finally I threw in&nbsp;the newspaper with Dr. Pattersons huge picture on it!&nbsp; That topped it off, and I walked inside leaving the fire to burn.&nbsp; I am still feel really bad, disappointed, and depressed, but that burning made me feel better.&nbsp; Now I am worried about what people will think of me and my low score......... I know that I deserved to get a 4.

      My scores arn't coming today.&nbsp; So far almost everybody&nbsp;has&nbsp;gotten&nbsp;their score&nbsp;and Vickie got a 4!&nbsp; She is alittle upset over it, even though it is a really good score and we are all happy for her.&nbsp; In my opinion, the 4 shows that she isn't anal about history and actually led a live during the school year.&nbsp; I am thinking that my score (the mail) might come around 1 o'clock so I am still hoping for a 4!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wish me good luck. &nbsp; For at least 2 more posts, I will be focusing on my AP score just because that is the most major part of my life right now.&nbsp;

      No AP History Score today...  I am one of four (that I know of) who did not recieve my score, which makes me more worried&nbsp;of what&nbsp;I will have to tell Satan (the teacher who taught HELL).&nbsp; So far I have heard of all the expected scores from people, like all the ones who have 5s!  God&nbsp;I can't wait until&nbsp;I can drive; I am thinking about taking the test next week, then I will be free.&nbsp; I can go places, like parties and peoples houses, without relying on other people.&nbsp; FREEDOM!&nbsp; Hopefully my license will jump start&nbsp;my social life,&nbsp;wait,&nbsp;it will have to create one&nbsp;first.&nbsp; HMMM...&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that&nbsp;will be it for now.&nbsp; Its getting late,&nbsp;I will update tomorrow with hopefully more to type and&nbsp;I will report on the outcome of&nbsp;my AP scores!&nbsp; The damn post office better deliver it or there will be&nbsp;hell to pay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
