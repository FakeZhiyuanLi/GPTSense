      I think it was this past Saturday, a calendar date for Israeli's (and all Jews alike)which marks the anniversary of the passing of Kabbalist R. Shimon bar Yohai.  The Jews celebrate by lighting (dancing and singing around) a bonfire.  Hag Sameah!

      I tried my darnest to upload a photo to the profile area, and it just wouldn't link up.  I store the photo in geocities so maybe that's the problem... ah well...  Inventory day, I hate inventory.  All the detergents and cleaning agents must be accounted for.  The spreadsheet is growing.  A good thing, BUT, sooner or later I'm going to need to plant my ass down and write some kind of a database or something...I'm lazy... and I procrastinate.  I took all the bastards (I use this to describe the enormous collection of tagless orchids which I aquired throughout the years)into the outdoors.  They're approving.  The leaves are greener, new growths are appearing, the roots are plump...I like what I see.    Newsflash:   We're going to Canada on Saturday.  I, O and I's little girl are going as well. Memorial Day should prove to be loads of fun!!!! Yippeee Niagara Falls, here we come! Though we wont have a lot of time, I'd like to do the outdoors as much as possible: Hiking, Swimming in waterfalls, observing the falls from the USA and Canada....and of course shopping, antiquing.....ahem...we only have two nights there :)....  I need to figure out what to do with the Bulbos that I brought here from HI.  I'm kind of tired of them.  eBay? Trade?......[Decisions, decisions...]...  Oh....I wish I could post a photo of the currently out of control in bloom Gongora quinquinervis [sp]....what it went through before it finally bloomed.... I love this fella with all of my heart I swear.  I posted several photos of it in a.b.p.o......I post there under GrlIntrpted......   Okay, break is over I have to get back to inventory...  Talk soon

      It's Friday, finally.  I'm off, though I did have to open shop at 7:30am this morning.  I left almost instantly and went home to tend to chores.    It's a muggy day today, no sun, no air either. In the 70's and no sun.  Going to the village to grab some food with Irene and Oleg, they know a cool Egyptian place where you sit on huge silk pillows in a tent. Irene says that they have a very cool belly dancing show too! Just what the doctor ordered!  Still can't pick up the scent on the Phal mannii, even asked my older boy to try and he couldn't pick up a scent either.  Someone said that Phal mannii produces a scent in it's third or fourth day after opening up fully and only when it is very warm around noon time! HUH... figures, when I'm not home :(.  Mom called from London again, they are having a blast! Tomorrow they are sailing to Copenhagen, from there to Amsterdam, St. Petersburg, and other eastern European areas... wish that I could go too, but I can't so there.  Tomorrow we might wind up at TJ's for an evening of dancing, eating and great company. Sunday I'm spending the entire day with the boys, the three of us.  Bob is golfing with Julian all day... I might take them to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Children's garden... we'll see ...  Have to run, shower time...  Later...

      It's muggy again.  Blow drying my hair this morning was a complete waste of time.  It's in complete chaos again.  Should have worn a baseball hat instead.    Bl. Morning Glory has two buds that are growing by the minute.  Another two buds are breaking through the sheath of another p/b.  I got this orchid from Wilk Orchid Specialties in Kaneohe, HI in March of 2003.  I got it in bloom and now it's starting to bloom for me (almost).  The tag reads: Sl. gratrixiae x C. intermedia.  I've been trying to find the correct name for this one but keep failing miserably.  If anyone knows the correct name, I'll be forever grateful if you would inform me of it!  The Masd Marguerite 'Lucinda Likes' and the Pleur chiapas are sulking.  The two had some rodent damage from the winter.  The new growths got munched on.  Since then I've moved them to the Laundromat.  They did well when it was cold, as the weather warmed up, they began sulking. I'm thinking of taking them back home where we keep it around 78F in the summer during the day, and bring it down to 68F at night.  There is also several humidifiers going at once, so they might do better there.  But, deep down inside, I know that they would perform much better for someone that lives up north, any folks from New England want to trade? Drop me a line ;).   Exciting News:  I won an eBay auction.  Phalaenopsis gersenii.  I would be very interested in obtaining more information about this particular orchid.  I understand that currently there is a debate on whether it is a naturally occurring hybrid of violacea and sumatrana and is sometimes labeled as Phal sumatrana var. gersenii, or if it is a true species.  So many endless controversies in the orchid world...it just doesn't stop!  Have to scoot...talk soon....

      What a novel concept.  An online diary linked to my orchid website.  I've blogged before, read LiveJournal....but it got old, I got old, I got busy, tired, and simply too annoyed to invest time into blogging.  Besides, I don't really know who'd spend time reading my nonesense....  NY is hot and muggy today.  The type of weather, that my orchids thrive in.  I've set up the Enc tempensis, Dendrobium meme pepi vepper, Epidendrum marmoratum, B. Little Stars,  Dendrobium lindleyi, Dendrobium aggregatum and Laelia Anceps to hang under the shading of the fig tree.  They get some direct sunlight, but mostly dappled sun.  I think that they're enjoying it.  Showing signs of new root growth on all of them, some producing new p/b's others are spiking up.    Been collecting rain water and letting the Bulbophyllums enjoy their daily bath in the rain water.  They're showing signs of appreciation too.    I don't know what to do about the C. granulosa 'John Jensen' x sib.  The leaves are mushy and wrinkly to the touch.  The roots are healthy and showing signs of strength, the p/b's are not soft, and a new growth is showing, but it isn't growing as quickly as it should.  I know that it doesn't like wet feet so I was keeping it on the drier side, and still it's sulking! Moved it around from shady to partial sun, and even full sun at certain hours.  In the winter of 2003-04 it sulked at home and contracted some kind of soft bulb fungus.  So I treated it with Physan 20, cut the affected p/b's and indeed new growth began almost instantly.  And then it slowed down.  What a shame....  Anyways, I must run now, I'm tying up the business line again!  Talk soon.
