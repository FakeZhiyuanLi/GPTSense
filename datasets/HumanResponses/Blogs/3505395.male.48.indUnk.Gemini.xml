                 The following are  stories I've written for a weekly column in our Sunday bulletin at  NewStart.         &nbsp;     When I was five I cheerfully stood by and  watched my three-year-old sister get a spanking for something I did. My mother  thought my sister did it, and I didn&#8217;t bother correcting her. A five-year-old&#8217;s  sins aren&#8217;t as impressive as an adult&#8217;s, but they are just as contrary to love.  When I was six I told Jesus I was sorry and asked him to help me be good.  Suddenly I felt so clean and free. The sky literally looked bluer and the grass  greener than I&#8217;d ever noticed before. I felt lighter than air. When I was 12 I  realized that even though I wanted to love like God loved, my heart was still  different from his and we struggled a lot. I then surrendered absolutely and  completely to his love and he filled and changed my heart in a way that carried  me through all the turmoil of adolescence. I found a joy and a peace that were  &#8211;&#8211; and are &#8211;&#8211; indescribable. I have had worries and struggles and hard times  since then. I have failed and messed up since then. But God hasn&#8217;t. That was  over 40 years ago, and his love for me seems sweeter than ever. Every time I  discover another old hurt or a new fear, he takes it and heals it or conquers it  and drives it out with his love. I highly recommend complete surrender to the  love of God.           &nbsp;       For years Michael Payne struggled with severe clinical  depression, failed marriages and rejection by churches. &nbsp;  Then NewStart sent out a couple of  mailers the week before Easter of 1999. &nbsp;   Michael received one of them, and cried when he read the challenge to  hope again. &nbsp;  He recognized in our  dream the cry of his own heart. &nbsp;  I&#8217;m  so glad he did. &nbsp;  At NewStart he  experienced the overwhelming love of God for him. &nbsp;  He began to find healing from the  depression, new joy and purpose and a renewed capacity to give and receive  love.         &nbsp;         God has given Michael the gift of  encouragement. &nbsp;  He can consistently  be counted on to contact and affirm our NewStart family members who are  struggling, stressed, sick or just absent from our fellowship. &nbsp;  He continually expresses to us the love  that God has placed in his heart. &nbsp;   He has become a dear friend and brother. &nbsp;  Surely some of God&#8217;s greatest moments  must include Michael Payne.          &nbsp;       When we talk about &#8220;God&#8217;s Greatest Moments&#8221; it&#8217;s easy to  focus on the dramatic crisis encounter, or the people with the showy gifts or  loud personalities. &nbsp;  It&#8217;s easy to  miss the real backbone of an organization, who stands in the shadows and quietly  keeps it all functioning. &nbsp;  Darrell  Bohannan is our church treasurer, with all the headaches and responsibilities  that entails.         &nbsp;       Three months after the Hearns arrived in the     United States    we still didn&#8217;t have a core group committed to starting a new church in  Frisco. &nbsp;  Neither the Hearns nor  Mercers lived in Frisco, yet. &nbsp;  We  decided to put together a &#8220;presentation service&#8221; to show the Nazarene churches  in the area what we envisioned. &nbsp;   Darrell attended that very first service on  June 13, 1998 . &nbsp;   When we met for three introductory meetings in downtown Frisco  immediately after that, he was there. &nbsp;   At the end of that third meeting he committed himself to membership and  identification with the dream of NewStart. &nbsp;            &nbsp;         When we met in homes, or in another church,  Darrell was there. &nbsp;  When we went  through the darkest times, personally and in terms of the vision, Darrell was  there. &nbsp;  When we needed someone to  tell us we were on the right track and that it wasn&#8217;t crazy to take the next big  leap, Darrell was there. &nbsp;  In all  this time, at every victory and in every moment of doubt, Darrell has so quietly  been there, supporting and believing, that we hardly recognize how much we lean  on him. &nbsp;  Surely, when God brought  Darrell Bohannan to us, that was one of &#8220;God&#8217;s greatest  moments.&#8221;          &nbsp;       She came to us with English as a second language and  uncertain what to expect of this new church. But she came with a quick, open  mind and a sensitive, perceptive heart. And how remarkably God has filled that  mind and heart!         She has told of how God has given her a new joy and a new  family &#8211;&#8211; both at NewStart and at home. She brought her husband and her children  and her friends and her relatives. She came with her hopes and fears and  strengths and struggles. With all the passion that is characteristic of her  approach to everything, she has thrown herself into the arms of a loving God.  She has preached with conviction and insight. She has ministered encouragement  to people who needed encouragement. She has cared for our children. She has  helped us dream our future. She has become a close friend and a genuine sister  to me and others. She has inspired and equipped others for extraordinary  ministry. She prays with discernment and power. The joy and intimacy of her  relationship with God are compelling and contagious. She has become a true  spiritual leader and example at NewStart.            She is proof to me, personally, that  everything I have believed about God is true. I am eternally grateful that God  brought Karin Hiort to NewStart.          &nbsp;       Roland had been here four months and we didn&#8217;t have a  church yet. &nbsp;  That wasn&#8217;t unusual,  but we didn&#8217;t know that. &nbsp;  The core  group of existing Nazarenes that we had expected to materialize as a nucleus for  the new church &#8211; hadn&#8217;t. &nbsp;  It was the  longest that Roland and Emmy had ever been away from home and the cultural  adjustments were greater than expected. &nbsp;   Satan was attacking them in fierce, unexpected ways. &nbsp;  In the middle of that dark time, Roland  met a guy named Don Crecelius and told him about our vision. &nbsp;  With nothing to show him in support of  the vision, Don announced that he would be part of that non-existent  church. &nbsp;  That struck me like the  thief on the cross who told Jesus &#8220;remember me when you come into your kingdom&#8221;  when every indication was that there wasn&#8217;t going to be any kingdom. &nbsp;  It represented simply stunning  faith.         &nbsp;        Roland took the pronouncement with a grain of  salt, but Don was even better than his word. &nbsp;  When, after several months of meeting in  someone else&#8217;s church building or private home, we finally found the building we  meet in today, it was totally unsuitable for our purposes. &nbsp;  Don walked in and mapped out an  appropriate floor plan on a napkin the first time he saw it. &nbsp;  He procured the labor, materials, and  permits and did much of the work with his own hands. &nbsp;  And he brought it in on time and under  budget. &nbsp;  He has loved us like a  brother. &nbsp;  He has led our men&#8217;s Bible  study. &nbsp;  He has shared our laughter  and tears, and shared his own with us. &nbsp;   His enthusiasm and confidence in God have lifted us when we were  down.  &nbsp;   He is that rarest of  treasures, an absolutely trustworthy and absolutely unshakable friend. &nbsp;  He is one of God&#8217;s greatest gifts to  NewStart and to me.       &nbsp;       If you&#8217;ve been a part of NewStart very long you&#8217;ve heard  this story, but I want to tell it again here. &nbsp;  Roland Hearn and I met on a Nazarene  discussion board on the internet. &nbsp;  I  was immediately drawn to his sense of humor and his passion for God and his  creative vision for how to minister the forgiving, healing grace of God to a  hurting world.         &nbsp;       When I was 20 years old I read in Reader&#8217;s Digest that  when a man is 20 years old he wants to save the world, but when he&#8217;s 40 he&#8217;s  happy if he can just save part of his paycheck. &nbsp;  I was 40 when Roland and I met, and I  was just about there. &nbsp;  I still  ranted and raved about passion and idealism, but I did it all from the safety of  the Sunday School class in my nice, big, established  church.         &nbsp;         I will always count Roland&#8217;s place in my  life as one of my greatest encounters with God. &nbsp;  By leaving his own country and all that  he held dear in order to pursue the vision of a church that effectively led  people to a radical, healing, transforming encounter with God, Roland dared me  to &#8220;put up or shut up.&#8221; &nbsp;  God used  him to rekindle in a 40-year-old man a young man&#8217;s dream that saving the world  was still a purpose to which I might legitimately give my life. &nbsp;  I pray that this morning&#8217;s service may  in some small way begin to do the same thing in your  heart.          &nbsp;       I have watched God transform Steve Montague&#8217;s life at    NewStart    Church   of the Nazarene &#8211; Frisco. &nbsp;  I knew him at    Richardson    Church   of the Nazarene and I knew he  sang and was single, but that was about it. &nbsp;  I don&#8217;t remember ever actually hearing  him sing and I didn&#8217;t know his story. &nbsp;   I do now, and it&#8217;s a marvelous story.         &nbsp;       The very first time we tried to show the Dallas District  of the Church of the Nazarene the kind of services we had in mind for NewStart,  Steve was in the service, on  June 13,  1998 . &nbsp;  He&#8217;s been here  ever since, although I didn&#8217;t really know why at first. &nbsp;  But I have felt chills up and down my  spine and my heart swell with love for him and our Abba Daddy as I have watched  God unfold his precious heart since then.          &nbsp;         My heart has been drawn into the Holy of  Holies in worship by Steve&#8217;s voice, and by his tears. &nbsp;  I&#8217;ve watched him become increasingly  free and comfortable as he leads us in worship and I&#8217;ve given thanks to  God. &nbsp;  I&#8217;ve listened to him at a  retreat or a home group tell of his journey from hopelessness to hope and I have  fallen in love with him and with his God. &nbsp;   I&#8217;ve watched him become a brother to my sisters and to me. &nbsp;  I am eternally grateful for his  encounters with God at NewStart. &nbsp;  It  is my great privilege to have encountered God through Steve Montague. &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;            &nbsp;       Fourteen years ago I went to    Belize  ,   Central America  to help fix up a poor church leader&#8217;s  house there. &nbsp;  I scraped and painted  along with others who performed various repair tasks inside the house, while a  crew of three guys re-roofed the house under the hot tropical sun. &nbsp;  We had the easy job. &nbsp;  They were badly sunburned and way past  what I would have considered the point of absolute physical exhaustion before  they were done. &nbsp;  One of those guys  was Curt Crawford. &nbsp;  Someone else  paid my way, but he paid his own way to work and suffer, out of love for Christ  and the church and the people of    Belize  .         &nbsp;         Later, he was my Sunday School teacher. &nbsp;  I watched him grow on the job until he  was a master at drawing out the quiet people while keeping the talkative ones  like me under control, all the while drawing out new insights into the character  of God from a scripture. &nbsp;  When I  became dissatisfied with my job he volunteered to help me update a resume and  network with potential employers. &nbsp;   He has consistently taught me by his words and by his actions what it  means to be a gracious Christian gentleman. &nbsp;  I am deeply grateful after all these  years to still encounter God through Curt  Crawford.          &nbsp;       NewStart sent out a mailer in September of 1999, inviting  Frisco to our new church. &nbsp;  One of  the people who came was Steve Steen, a child psychologist with a lot of pain in  his life and a fair bit of suspicion toward God and church. &nbsp;  Over the following three years I got to  participate in conversations with Steve in which he made probing, challenging  critiques of what we were about and asked hard, honest questions about what we  believed about the character of God. &nbsp;   At the same time, he was equally honest as he looked at his own heart and  the hopes and fears and assumptions he found there.         &nbsp;         I have watched Steve&#8217;s analytical mind and  tender heart embrace God and us. &nbsp;  I  have watched him deliberately invite God deeper and deeper into his life. &nbsp;  I&#8217;ve watched him begin to draw others  into the love of God, ministering grace to his own clients and family. &nbsp;  He has become a friend and a brother and  an inspiration to me. &nbsp;  In the Bible,  the highest and final credit Jesus gives to those who love him is that they fed  the hungry, and in so doing, they fed him. &nbsp;   Steve has fed me when I was hungry. &nbsp;   He has valued me when I didn&#8217;t feel valuable. &nbsp;  I have encountered God through Steve  Steen.          &nbsp;       I&#8217;ve written here the stories of people of NewStart,  people from the Bible and early Nazarenes who have shaped my understanding of  God. &nbsp;  Is it okay in such a column to  write about my own wife?         &nbsp;       I have been loved more deeply, more purely, more  sacrificially, more sensitively, more passionately and more consistently by  Karen Mercer than by anyone else in my life. &nbsp;  I have encountered God and come to  better understand his character through Karen&#8217;s love for  me.         &nbsp;             She has cheered me on and believed in me when I struggled  to achieve something. &nbsp;  I think God  must be like that. &nbsp;  She has believed  the best of me when the best was true, even when others didn&#8217;t. &nbsp;  She has loved and understood and  sympathized and forgiven when the best wasn&#8217;t true. &nbsp;  I am confident that God is like  that. &nbsp;  She has received my best with  joy and pride even when my best wasn&#8217;t really very impressive. &nbsp;  She has shown me who needed love and how  to love them. &nbsp;  She has loved others  on my behalf, in ways that I could not. &nbsp;   I&#8217;m so glad.         &nbsp;         I have encountered God in my marriage. &nbsp;  I think that&#8217;s what he  intended.          &nbsp;       Intelligent, good-looking, successful, he&#8217;d never really  felt much need for religion. &nbsp;  He  made a deal with his wife, though, that &#8211; just this one time -- he&#8217;d try the new  church she was all excited about. &nbsp;   If he didn&#8217;t like it they&#8217;d find something else to do together on  Sundays. &nbsp;  He was pretty sure he  wouldn&#8217;t like it. &nbsp;  He was wrong &#8211;  about liking the new church and about needing  &#8220;religion.&#8221;         &nbsp;       Christer Hiort unexpectedly encountered his heavenly  father, and he fell completely in love. &nbsp;   Very much against his expectations, Christer fell in love like he never  had before in his life. &nbsp;  He  discovered that when he stumbles, God is eager and able to pick him up  again. &nbsp;  He discovered that the love  of God is able to help him to stand. &nbsp;   He fell head over heels in love with God. &nbsp;  He fell more deeply and more purely in  love with his wife than he had ever been before. &nbsp;  He fell in love with his kids all over  again. &nbsp;  In great, mighty,  astonishing leaps he grew in love and in knowledge and in  wisdom.         &nbsp;             Along the way, he became a precious,  treasured brother to me and others. &nbsp;   He ministers to us and he confirms for us the grace and power of  God. &nbsp;  I am so grateful for my  encounters with God through Christer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             &nbsp;       One of the great joys of being a part of the family of  God, and especially of being a part of a local community of faith, is having our  own faith confirmed by seeing God at work in the lives of people around us, just  as He has worked in ours. &nbsp;  When we  let God work in our own lives, we also participate with Him in the work He  desires to do in other people, because they get to see Him reflected in  us.         &nbsp;       I have seen Christ in Jim Sublette. &nbsp;  I have seen him reflect everything that  NewStart is about. &nbsp;  He has confirmed  my faith in what God desires to do in my life and in my church. &nbsp;  I have seen him be open and honest and  vulnerable about his doubts, his struggles, his pain and his past. &nbsp;  When he wanted to walk away I&#8217;ve seen  him instead choose to trust God and embrace love and relationship at new  levels. &nbsp;  I&#8217;ve seen his family  growing spiritually as he has lead by example. &nbsp;  We have laughed together and cried  together and worked and played together. &nbsp;   And I have seen Christ in Jim Sublette.         &nbsp;        He has become a vital part of what God is doing  and is going to do here. &nbsp;  He leads  us in worship as a part of our Sunday morning worship team. &nbsp;  He&nbsp;has worked behind the  scenes&nbsp;on our website so that it becomes a more effective  community-building tool for NewStart. &nbsp;   His tender heart makes the men&#8217;s Saturday morning Bible study a holy  place. &nbsp;  He has led us to be  accountable and to keep our promises. &nbsp;   We are privileged to see God reflected in our friend and brother Jim  Sublette.       &nbsp;       Rick Milnes has been a part of NewStart since September,  1999. &nbsp;&nbsp;  I have encountered God  through Rick. &nbsp;  He has shared with us  his pain and struggles, his gifts and talents. &nbsp;  I&#8217;ve watched him sing songs of worship  with tears in his eyes, and seen grace at work. &nbsp;  I&#8217;ve watched him laughing with the kids  from the platform and seen the love of God reflected in  him.           Since Rick joined us I&#8217;ve watched him raise  questions and seen his open heart receive new truth. &nbsp;  I&#8217;ve heard him humbly confess his  failures and receive grace. &nbsp;  During  all that time, as we have laughed together and cried together, worshiped  together and played together, I have watched Rick grow in the likeness of  Christ, more than he probably recognizes. &nbsp;   He remains very humble about his spiritual walk. &nbsp;  But I have loved watching Rick&#8217;s heart  grow softer and more radiant as he eagerly embraces every new step in his  journey with God. &nbsp;  Rick is an  inspiration and a blessing to me. &nbsp;  I  gratefully count him a brother.          &nbsp;       The earliest converts are extraordinarily encouraging to  the hopes of a new church. &nbsp;  When  someone new comes into our circle and, maybe for the first time, begins to hope  that God might, after all, be a God of love and integrity, and we begin to see  healing happen, it reaffirms and encourages our own faith as little else  can.         I have encountered God through my friendship with Will  Presnall. He was an atheist who said he&#8217;d never go to church. But God had been  preparing Will&#8217;s brilliant, probing, analytical mind to receive grace long  before he came to NewStart. And from the very first Sunday he visited our  services, I saw his heart begin to confirm the truths his mind had already  grasped. He immediately began to pour himself into seeking more grace, and to  building relationships in places like Sunday night home group and the Saturday  morning men&#8217;s Bible study. &nbsp;  Now, he  and Lori can lead a Bible study like they&#8217;ve been doing it all their  lives.           I&#8217;ve seen a deepening peace in his face, and  heard a more confident joy develop in his voice, and noted in his behavior a  heightened awareness of the needs and value of the people around him. Will is a  brother to me. &nbsp;  I have encountered  God in him.          &nbsp;       I was amazed. &nbsp;   I didn&#8217;t think public school teachers were allowed to do the things this  young woman in her 20's talked about doing with her students. &nbsp;  She taught math, but she also cried with  those kids and listened to them and loved them and brought them to Jesus. &nbsp;  I remember going with her to a poor,  south   Dallas   neighborhood to help a  Hispanic family, and painting a house with her in  Central  America . &nbsp;  One of the  phrases sometimes used to describe the result of the relationship with God we  preach about at NewStart is &#8220;radical optimism.&#8221; &nbsp;  She personified that  trait.         &nbsp;       As the years passed I watched her struggle with the hurts  that sooner or later come into everyone&#8217;s life, like her mother&#8217;s slow, painful  death. &nbsp;  I watched her being beaten  down by other hurts that seem especially to happen in the church. &nbsp;  I&#8217;ve watched her struggle against anger  and bitterness and cynicism and disillusionment. &nbsp;  And I&#8217;ve watched her win. &nbsp;  I&#8217;ve watched her come through the hurts  of life with her radical optimism and love and joy and hope reborn, stronger and  more beautiful than ever. &nbsp;            &nbsp;         Now she is one of our pastors at  NewStart.&nbsp; My wife Karen and I named our daughter Charlotte Denise Mercer  after her, and I&#8217;m glad our daughter has such role models. &nbsp;  I have encountered God through Denise  Crawford over and over again for years. &nbsp;   I&#8217;m glad that our adoption into the family of God gives me the right to  call her my sister.           &nbsp;      Amber Rogde was employed by a    Nazarene    University   in    Oklahoma   when she discovered  NewStart. &nbsp;  She immediately and  unhesitatingly embraced the paradigm of love that she found here. &nbsp;  She quit her job and moved here, at  least in part to become a part of this fellowship and help us fulfill the vision  God has given us.      &nbsp;      I have watched her bare her soul before God and the family of God. &nbsp;  I have seen Christ in her as she has  allowed him to heal her hurts. &nbsp;  I  have seen Christ in her as she has related to me with sisterly compassion and  concern when I was hurting. &nbsp;  I have  seen Christ in her when she has led us into worship through the music on Sunday  morning. &nbsp;  I have seen Christ in her  as she has modeled to our children what it means to be children of  God.      &nbsp;        In her laughter and in her tears, I have  encountered God through Amber. &nbsp;  I&#8217;m  so glad I get to be a part of a family and a church made up of people like  her.       &nbsp;       Karin Hiort never really had much to do with church, and  recent visits to churches had not impressed her much, but she was hungry for  God. &nbsp;  Karin had a friend named Lori  Presnall. &nbsp;  Lori was tired and  discouraged and wasn&#8217;t experiencing the love of God very fully in the church she  was attending, but she nevertheless encouraged Karin to find a church where she  could experience God and find the desires of her heart met. &nbsp;  Karin did. &nbsp;  She found God at NewStart and told Lori  about it.         &nbsp;         Since the Pressnalls became a part of our  life I have seen God in Lori. &nbsp;  I  have seen his grace at work in how she came to us. &nbsp;  I have seen her dear, sweet, sad face  begin to light up. &nbsp;  I have seen God  begin to restore to her his love and joy and peace and hope. &nbsp;  Her faithfulness has encouraged me. &nbsp;  Her willingness to allow God to work his  transforming grace in her heart and in her marriage has inspired me. &nbsp;  Her smile and her tears have touched my  heart. &nbsp;  I have encountered God in  Lori Presnall. &nbsp;  I am glad our  heavenly father has made her a sister to  me.

      Christer was Contract Director for Swedish-based telecommunications giant Ericsson.  His employer had transferred him from his native Sweden to Saudi Arabia, Holland and now Texas. He had a successful career, a wonderful wife and children, good health and a nice home.  His wife Karin was a teacher.  They thought about God only vaguely if at all, and viewed the church as irrelevant and alien at best, and oppressive and foolish at worst.  Prosperous and apparently socially and emotionally secure, Christer and Karin, like most Swedes and perhaps most Europeans, were thoroughly secular and thoroughly post-modern in their worldview and cultural perspectives.  Karin, however, was spiritually searching.  She was a voracious reader who had concluded from her eclectic religious and philosophical readings that God was more a force than a person, and prayer was “channeling love energy.”  Then, in April of 1999, she received an arresting piece of junk mail.  Splattered at random across the page were words like loneliness, alienation, self-loathing, rage and despair.  At the bottom of the page was the challenge to “dare to hope again, one more time.”  With some trepidation, she took the challenge and attended the first public service of NewStart Church of the Nazarene in Frisco, Texas, an upscale suburb of Dallas.  She expressed pleasant surprise after the service that we hadn’t verbally attacked homosexuals, or done any of the other things she’d apparently expected of an American Protestant church.  A few weeks later she brought her husband with her.  He agreed to attend just that once, and if he didn’t like it, she agreed that they’d find something else to do as a family on Sundays thereafter.  As it turned out, he did like it.  He expressed surprise that the Christians he met at NewStart were more intelligent than he’d expected.    In the weeks to follow they developed close, deep friendships with several other people in the church.  A few months later, Karin accepted Christ in a women’s weekday Bible study.  A few months after that, Christer accepted Christ in the home of Pastor Roland Hearn.  A few months later, they were each sanctified, separately, in their own prayer times.  Along the way, with little or no prompting from anyone but the Holy Spirit, sins and vices dropped away.  Everything but perfect love was crowded out of their hearts.  They told us they had never experienced such love.  As time passed, they would come to us and tell us “I will never forget this day” and “This has been the best week of my life” and then “This has been the best year of my life.”    They both now serve on our church board, are both taking classes in the ministerial course of study and have both preached in our Sunday morning services at NewStart.  They’ve attended district assemblies and a general assembly and have conducted Swedish-language services at NewStart for the Swedish community in north Dallas.  Numerous friends and relatives in Sweden, after attending NewStart while on vacation in Texas, and seeing the transformation in Karin’s and Christer’s lives, now eagerly await the planting of a church like NewStart in Sweden someday.  One after another, through the doors of NewStart have come a steady succession of similar stories of people who were educated and successful and on the outside appeared to have no need, but on the inside felt empty and worthless and purposeless and in pain.  An engineer, a project manager, an executive, a psychologist, a salesman, a housewife, a single parent, they brought every dysfunction imaginable to NewStart Church of the Nazarene and to God: alcoholism, drug addiction, sexual addictions, personality disorders, eating disorders, suicidal depression and self-mutilation as well as obsessions with careers and money.  Most of them knew little or nothing about God and the Christian church and what they did know they didn’t like.  Now they are a glorious church, without spot or wrinkle, washed in the blood of the lamb.  Now a holiness people, committed to the world-wide vision of the Church of the Nazarene, they live in deep, pure, intimate, honest, vulnerable, loving relationships as brothers and sisters, sharing in all the struggles and victories of the spirit-filled life in this fallen world.    NewStart-Frisco began with no core group and no financial support except a pastoral salary from the district.  We started with the pastor and one layman and a paradigm for translating the message of holiness into the language of the developed world in the 21st Century.  We never denounced a single sin in a Sunday morning service, never preached about money or stewardship, and never passed an offering plate.  A little over three years after our launch, though, we were a fully organized, fully self-supporting church of seventy people who are being set free from sin and set free to love.  We are growing numerically, financially and spiritually.  We are in love with God, each other and the denomination.  We are united in our excitement about, and commitment to, the vision that God has given us.  We believe that it is a vision that is transferable to Sweden, Holland or our pastor’s homeland in Australia as readily as to the neighboring suburbs of north Dallas.  That vision – that paradigm – is essentially this:  We start with the objective truth, found in I John 4:8 and 4:16 that “God is love.”  We recognize that love has no value for us until it is recognized, received and experienced.  If love means anything at all, it must mean something about value.  If we say we love something, we mean it has value to us.  Jesus says of us in Matthew 10:31: “don’t be afraid; you are more valuable to him than a whole flock of sparrows.”  Being born in sin must at least in part mean to be born without the knowledge that God is love, and without the knowledge that we are innately valuable to him.  Our sinful acts may to some degree be recognized as the search for a sense of self-worth in the absence of God, or as the search for a way to medicate the pain of feeling worthless.  We are isolated and disconnected and without the capacity to love and be loved – to live in intimate relationship as we were designed to live.  We don’t and can’t love God with all our heart, soul, mind and strength, or our neighbor as ourselves.  To fulfill the greatest commandment, and the second one that is like it, means to live in deep, pure, perfect love relationship with God and each other.  We are born for relationship.  It is our destiny.  We have no other or higher purpose.  As a church, we have no other purpose but to model those relationships in such a way as to draw people to Christ, who alone can restore them to those relationships which are the cry of their hearts.  We are to spend our lives modeling and nurturing those restored relationships.  In that context alone can we find holiness, healing and spiritual growth.  As we were planting NewStart Church of the Nazarene in Frisco, we tried to think through all of the issues, practices, programs, structures and language of the local church in terms of that fundamental understanding.  Are we, in everything we say and do as a church, effectively communicating that fundamental understanding to the world, or even to each other, here and now, today?  We decided that if “gospel” is just a Greek word for the English phrase “good news,” then any time the message of the church didn’t sound like good news, we weren’t saying it right.  Those basic ideas, when really worked through to their ultimate, practical conclusion in all the details of church life, have utterly transformed the way we do church.  Of course, one of the wonderful spin-offs for Roland and me, as third-generation Nazarenes, is the confirmation of everything we’ve always most treasured at the heart of what it means to be a Nazarene.  We get to see first-hand the truth and the power of entire sanctification, of heart holiness, and of the radical optimism of Wesleyanism.  Sometimes these new Nazarenes, so very different in so many ways, describe their new life in Christ even in the same words that Phineas Bresee and Buddie Robinson used, before they’ve ever even heard of those men.    If those core truths are going to impact our culture as profoundly as they impacted Bresee’s and Uncle Buddie’s, though, we have to understand, not only those truths, but our own culture, as well as they did.  The church many of us grew up in was built by the generation before the Baby Boomers – the “Builder Generation.”  From political parties to civic clubs to fraternal organizations to churches, they were “joiners.”  They felt valued by being admitted into an exclusive circle, with impressive ceremony.  As the nickname of that generation suggests, they were builders.  They expressed value for their neighbor by raising a barn or for their family by naming a business after themselves “& Sons.”  They built edifices and monuments as a way of saying “this is important.  These people or ideas have value.”  They respected authority and hierarchy, and wanted a title and a sense of active rank within the hierarchy.  Structure, rules, titles and clearly-defined roles for everyone represented a way to artificially replace the ancient sense of order and belonging that were being lost in a rapidly industrializing and urbanizing world.  The Nazarene church of 50 or 100 years ago did a brilliant job of expressing holiness – perfect love – in forms that the culture around them could readily find compelling.  As a result, the church grew impressively in numerical terms, and a generation grew up routinely hearing fresh testimonies of the experience of full salvation.    The urban and suburban culture of the 21st Century Information Age is very different from the rural and small-town culture of the 19th and 20th Century Industrial Age, but our charge as Nazarenes is the same: to be like the men of Issachar in I Chronicles 12:32, “who understood the times, and knew what Israel should do.”  To communicate perfect love as effectively to our generation as our grandfathers did to theirs, we must understand the times.  Generation X, even more than the Boomer generation, values experience over theory, consensus over authority and belonging over joining.  It’s not enough for us that an idea sounds good; we have to be able to make it our own in a practical way.  We have to be able to see that it works.  Experience, of course, is one leg of the Wesleyan quadrilateral, so in this, our generation is more amenable to Wesleyanism than previous generations.  “Question Authority” has been the mantra of Western culture since the 1960’s, so we tend, in pretty much any forum, whether work, government or church, to just instinctively bristle when someone expects us to believe or do something solely on the basis of some asserted authority.  We expect to be empowered to think for ourselves, and valued for our capacity to do so.  We’ll all pursue a course of action together because we are all heard, and thrash through the ideas together until we reach a consensus, not just because the leader lays it all out for us.  Finally, we are hesitant to formally “join” any organization as a “dues-paying member.”  To join is to submit to authority and duty.  Perhaps there was a time when we felt valued by being taken under someone’s wing, but today we are skeptical and fearful of being expected to “check our brains at the door.”  Yet somehow we still want to belong – to be in deep, real, honest relationships where we can know that the people who know us best love us most.  We want to be loved unconditionally, and not just because we perform adequately or live up to your expectations.  We want to be free to agree with you because what you’re saying is reasonable, rather than because you’re the expert.  You value me today by embracing me as an equal.    So, in short, we recognize that God is love, that he considers every person to be genuinely, innately valuable, and that the whole plan of salvation is God reconciling us through Christ – restoring in us the capacity for relationship, first with him, and secondarily with each other.  We recognize that our culture values experience over theory, consensus over authority and belonging over joining.  We recognize that to love the people of our culture effectively, so as to draw them to Christ, we must communicate effectively with them, which means communicating with them in a way that is consistent with these assumptions about the culture.  This is the foundation of our paradigm.  Now, the revolutionary part is the part where we begin to actually do church as if we meant the paragraph above.  We have to basically tear up the blueprint for church and start over from that paragraph.  Where does that take us?  How does all this affect the way we present the gospel, and structure our services and programs?  First, we look at our “Frisco Fred and Francine” demographic model.  In addition to the cultural assumptions already stated, we see that they are college-educated, prosperous professionals, probably between the ages of 30 and 50.  They may both work outside the home, but in any case, the woman expects to be treated like an independent, competent adult.  They have a couple of children.  They don’t go to church.  If they ever have attended church regularly in the past, it’s an unpleasant memory and they didn’t really get the jargon down pat, and didn’t come away with a lot of theological understanding.  Their first contact with NewStart will either be through some sort of mass marketing like a mailer or through a personal contact.  If it’s a mailer, the mailer will not assume they care what the Bible says about anything.  It will acknowledge that they have emotional pain that is not apparent, and speak to their desire to be loved and valued and to belong.  It may not suggest that God, much less the Church of the Nazarene, is the answer to their problems, although the name “Church of the Nazarene” will probably appear somewhere in the mailer.  It will just offer a place to find love, acceptance and emotional healing.  If their first contact is a person, that person will be a friend, and the friend won’t be acting out of a duty to evangelize, or as a part of any organized “outreach” program.  The NewStart friend will just be loving and enjoying and valuing his or her unsaved friend, and somewhere in a conversation at some point, the source of the NewStart friend’s new-found joy and excitement and contentment will come up.  The NewStart friend will invite the unsaved friend to NewStart, not out of generic obligation to “win the lost,” but simply out of a spontaneous desire to see a hurting friend that they love experience the same love and joy and peace that the rest of us have found at NewStart.  We don’t invite people to church because they’re bad; we invite them because we like them.  We don’t invite them because we’re supposed to; we invite them because we’re genuinely confident they’ll like the church and be glad to find what we know they’re going to find there.  When they get to the church, they find a convenient parking space available and walk in to a foyer that is warm and inviting.  They are greeted warmly, not by an appointed greeter, but just by someone who is genuinely glad to meet them.  They are steered toward a table loaded with breakfast foods and drinks, while someone who has met them offers them a name tag with their name written on it.  The regulars in the church, including the pastor, have similar handwritten name tags already, so the visitor doesn’t stand out.  The visitor walks into the main room, which they may never hear anyone refer to as a sanctuary, and sits just inside the room, near the exit, because the regulars have left those seats available to them for their comfort and convenience.  They see a low platform with drums and guitars and microphones, and on the front walls they see a couple of big screens.  At the end of each row of seats is a small box of facial tissues, because tears will be fairly common during our services.    As the music team begins, the house lights go dim, giving the visitor simultaneously a sense of intimacy and anonymity.  The lyrics are on the screens as we sing, so the visitor is free to sing along, but they are never cajoled to do so.  After the first song, someone, usually the pastor, although he will not identify himself as such, will stand and welcome everyone with words that will reassure them that nothing scary, imposing or manipulative is about to happen, just inviting them to relax and enjoy the hour.  The songs have a light rock/pop feel to them, with lyrics that invite either celebration of, or reflection on, the love of Christ for us.  After a few songs a short clip from a recent movie will be shown.  The clip will illustrate or provoke an emotion or relationship problem that the sermon is going to address.  Because the visitor doesn’t acknowledge the authority of the Bible, the sermon doesn’t start with a Bible text; it starts with a joke or a personal story.  It then generalizes from there to the deepest personal hopes, fears, hurts and needs that we all have, and suggests that we are valued and loved by someone who can and will meet our needs.  At some point in the message then, a passage of scripture will appear on the screen, and the preacher will show that the Bible addresses the very human dilemma we’ve been talking about, and provides the very solution that has just been suggested.  It is a message presented by a fellow traveler, and not by someone who has “already attained all this, or already been made perfect,” as Paul wrote.  The message will be free of condemnation, manipulation or appeals to duty or authority.  Christ will be presented more as brother and friend than as Lord and King, although of course, if the visitor embraces him at that level, he will soon enough be able to joyfully embrace him as Lord and King as well.  The message will be followed by reflective music, which will be followed by a “prayer of healing” accompanied perhaps by soft music and a photograph of a tranquil scene of some sort on the screens.  After the prayer will be a celebratory song, followed by an onscreen video of announcements for the week and a request that everyone fill out a response card.  That request is accompanied by the assurance that the contact information will just be used to send out a thank you note for our attendance, and won’t put us on any permanent mailing list.  The last image on the screen is the sentence “Thank you for being a part of the dream.”  The lights then go up and people begin to stand up and disperse.  At no point in the service was money mentioned or an offering taken.  The visitor absolutely will notice the absence of condemnation, authority or financial appeals, and he or she will be both puzzled and pleased.  Hardly anyone will leave the church facility before at least a half-hour of visiting after the service.  The announcements video at the end of the service invited them to numerous opportunities throughout the week for prayer times, Bible studies, breakfasts and shopping or sporting events.  If not after their first visit, certainly after a second visit someone will invite the visitor out to eat, and to one of the other events during the week.  We will deliberately work at developing a personal relationship with the visitor, with no ulterior motive beyond making them feel loved and valued.  If we do that well enough, we’ve found that the Holy Spirit does the rest.  If we love someone long enough, deeply enough, genuinely enough and safely enough, at some point they come under such deep conviction, and such deep desire for forgiveness, that they will confess all their sins and accept the Author of love, as counter-intuitive as that sounds.  If real love for real people is not our motive for doing something, we don’t do it.  No one preaches, teaches, sings or greets out of duty or ego needs.  In fact, we rotate every ministry in the church.  Someone other than the pastor preaches once a month.  The music team and worship leader take turns, as do the teachers, cleaners and so forth.  If someone tells us they won’t be at church next Sunday because they’re doing something else, we say: “Great! Have a good time!”  People come to church because they want to, not because they have to.  The result is a new generation of Nazarenes.  They know what we believe, why we believe it and where we came from.  We don’t take an offering, but the people give sacrificially.  We don’t have adult Sunday School classes on Sunday, but the people joyfully meet in small groups through the week to explore God’s word and disciple each other.  We don’t flaunt titles, but the pastor is loved, respected and effective.  We don’t have a paid staff, but we have full-time associate pastors.  We don’t have a local structure we call NYI or NMI, but we have teens planning on going to Nazarene colleges, adults building relationships with Nazarenes in other countries, eager to do church planting in other countries, and enthusiastic about our financial commitment to the World Evangelism Fund and other denominational budgets.  Wesleyanism makes infinitely more sense to this generation than Calvinism or Catholicism or any other major religious system.  The Church of the Nazarene was raised up to be God’s agent in the developed world in the 21st Century.  We have the message.  This is our time.  We can change the world.
