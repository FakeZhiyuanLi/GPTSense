      In September of 1996, I was backpacking through Israel when I landed in the northern hill town of Tzfat (AKA Safed).  Tzfat is the epicenter of Jewish mysticism and has become a...wait for it...Mecca for people interested in living a thoroughly Jewish life, complete with exhaustive ritual and worship, but with a focus on the more esoteric teachings of  urlLink Kabbalah , rather than the more literal Judaism prevelent in Jerusalem.  Often, people arrive in Tzfat wanting to merely dabble, but end up moving there and dramatically changing their lives.  For lodging I stayed at a hostel run by an Orthodox Jewish organization providing free shelter in exchange for attendance at religious education classes held several times a day.  It's no secret that many Jewish tourists traveling around Israel have a sometimes hidden (sometimes not) agenda to have some kind of religious or spiritual experience while in the Holy Land, especially Jews from the U.S. where spirituality is mostly marginalized.  After all, when you return from a trip to Israel, you will invariably be asked by many people whether or not anything happened, and by the way the question is formed, you know they're not asking whether or not you got sick from eating too many dates.    In Tzfat, something happened, but I've only recently figured out what it was.  I had already been through Jerusalem and had prayed at the holiest Jewish site in the world, the  urlLink Western Wall , the remnants of the Holy Temple destroyed by the Romans in 68 C.E.  While it was indeed an incredible place to visit, and while I did feel the weight of history and the echoes of millions of prayers thick in the air, I came away feeling like something was missing, as if I was supposed to have had a catharsis or awakening.  Indeed, nothing so dramatic happened during my entire visit.  And so I came to Tzfat a bit let down, but not without hope that I'd pick up something of spiritual value.  It was in that spirit that I attended a morning class with a Rabbi whose name, sadly, never stuck with me.    We spent the entire hour talking about the first line of the Book of Genesis.  Well, at least the Rabbi tried to contain the discussion to the first line, quoting commentary written over hundreds of years, analyzing every word in that first sentence.  Every word, of course, had numerous possible meanings as there is a great deal of interpretation that comes with translating from Hebrew.  So, I thought this level of scrutiny was a green light for me to ask a question about the rest of the creation story, a question that had bugged me for years.   hjm: Rabbi, do you really believe that heaven and earth were created in 6 days?  Six days as we know them now?  Six twenty-four hour days?  Rabbi: Yes, I do.    hjm: What about modern interpretations that suggest the possibility that each of those 6 days actually lasted millions of years?  Rabbi: No. They were twenty-four hour days, just as we experience them today.  hjm: So, you actually believe that is has only been 5,755 years since heaven and earth were created.  Rabbi: Yes.  hjm: What about science?  What about carbon date testing that shows fossils to be millions of years old?  Rabbi:  Scientists believe what they want to believe, and I believe what I want to believe.   On the surface, there was nothing remarkable about this Rabbi.  He wore the traditional black and white clothes, his hair and beard were characteristically unkempt, he was probably not that much older than me, but he'd forgotten more about Judaism than I had ever learned.  In hindsight, what I realize now as significant was the utter sincerity, the quiet conviction, the peacefulness he exuded, comforted by his faith and under no pressure whatsoever to justify it to anyone.  Sure, he taught the classes in hopes that others might share the rewards of his faith.  Yet, he had no desire to force his views on anyone.    So, it strikes me how different he was from other people I have met who profess a deep, passionate faith.  It has been my misfortune to have more than once been confronted by religious zealotry, an entirely different practice in faith with a very different presentation.  The zealot seems driven more by desperation than anything else.  They have seen the light and operate from a place of panic, feeling that they are personally responsible for the salvation of others.    For years after my trip, I liked to tell the story about that Rabbi, and it is with some degree of shame that I realize that I actually took delight in pointing out what, until now, seemed like the worst kind of blind faith, the shunning of fundamental scientific discoveries in favor of a literal interpretation of a document, The Bible, that scientists and scholars have made few solid conclusions about.  I got a lot of mileage with that anecdote and missed the point completely.  In the end, it was more important that the Rabbi was benevolent than whether or not he was right about the origins of the universe.  One can have all the faith in the world, but if he/she does not practice tolerance towards fellow humans who have their own version of faith, if they are motivated by desperation rather than love, then not only are they are in no position to be prosletyzing, but they are hardly models of an enlightened being, totally incapable of demonstrating the benefits of faith.

      "Roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair."  - Bruce Springsteen   That's what this blog is all about, right there.  My hope, dear reader, is that anytime you want to have that refreshing, exhilirating experience of sticking your head out of a moving vehicle, without the risk of looking like a dog, or of being beheaded by a passing semi, you will set your browser compass to transcendentalfloss.  It is WAY too scary to boast that we will always be a breath of fresh air.  On the contrary, it may occasionally happen that you'll have to contend with periodic gaseous emissions.  I will promise you, however, that we will always do our best to leave the smallest possible footprint on our beloved spaceship earth, and we will never knowingly contribute to global warming.    Enjoy.

      Josh Marshall made a  urlLink  post   to his blog last night that is very tempting to believe. He talks about the tone of the Democratic National Convention as being starkly different from the tone of the campaign amongst the candidates for the nomination.  Much has been said in the media about how the rhetoric of the DNC has been surprisingly light in terms of attacks on the Bush Administration, and Josh offers his explanation in two points:   First:   On the surface, the fiery rhetoric and animus of 2003 and early 2004 were directed at President Bush. And to some degree of course they were. But the punch of that rhetoric derived not so much from Democrats' antipathy for President Bush as from a pitched battle, almost a rebellion, within the Democratic party -- the grassroots of the Democratic party insisting that Washington Democrats were compromising with the president over particulars when he was leading the country in a direction that had to be opposed across the board. Fiery rhetoric against President Bush was fiery rhetoric against compromise and accommodation with him. In other words, it was to a very real degree aimed at other Democrats.    Second:   Anger is often, and rage is almost always, an emotion rooted in powerlessness. That was certainly the position of Democrats in early 2003 (on so many levels), though less so as the year went on. These Democrats don't feel powerless. The mood is one of cautious optimism that they can drive the president from office, that the wind is at their backs.   So, Josh thinks the change in tone is a sign of unity and optimism.  That certainly is a glass-half-full way to interpret it.  Yet, while I'd rather be optimistic, the polls showing Bush and Kerry in a dead heat, despite the glaring fact that the Bush Administration has dragged this country through the gutter, erode my ability to believe that the Democratic Party has what it takes to beat the Republicans.  What Josh sees as a new found confidence, I see as fearful, tip-toe dancing around the swing voters.    The point that anger is "almost always" rooted in powerlessness, while likely true, rules out the potent combination of anger and confidence, righteous indignation, that occasionally surfaces during struggles for freedom and justice.  As a model, I look to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  MLK spoke the plain truth and there was no way to hide the legitimate anger he felt about racism.  He had utter confidence that he was right and deep faith that he would succeed.  I find it deeply ironic that the most successful movies in America are blockbuster action films with heroes who act out of righteous indignation.  It is a classic American icon, yet somewhere along the line the Democratic Party decided that this formula doesn't work.  Yes, the media jumped all over Howard Dean for his post-Iowa pep rally.  The key, however, was how the Dean campaign, and the Democrats in general, reacted.  Rather than defend the emotion that Dean was showing, which I contend was much more that of enthusiasm than anger, they apologized and toned it down.  This is classic pacification, and the worst part is that it is self-inflicted.

         urlLink The New York Times > Week in Review > What Boston Can Do for Kerry : "Yet for all that, the American convention remains a singular moment in the nominating process - a relic of a bygone time, perhaps, but a relic that nonetheless keeps driving the story line of a presidential election. And that is no small matter for John Kerry, the likely Democratic nominee.  Mr. Kerry will head to Boston - where the convention begins next Monday - remembering and trying to duplicate Mr. Clinton's success. Americans do not seem overly enthused about him. If polls showing him tied with Mr. Bush are to be believed,  Mr. Kerry has so far been unable to take advantage of abundant evidence that Americans are looking for a change in the White House.   Mr. Kerry's advisers say that it is not that voters don't like him; it is that they still do not know him, even after $80 million worth of television advertisements, close to 50 candidate debates and almost two years of campaigning. Yet Mr. Kerry's aides see these polls, and are clearly hungering for these four days in Boston to break this deadlock, preparing with a level of intensity and detail that serves as the ultimate validation of the power of conventions."  This year, the Democratic National Convention is taking place merely for Big Dems to glad hand one another and for some Little Dem wannabes to wait for the party to collapse.   What is emphasized above I stated was Kerry's electability problem back in February/March (not here but elsewhere as t-floss hadn't been around then). Back then I was even leaning to voting for Bush if the Democratic National Party allowed the early primaries to elect a candidate who may have been winning the party faithful but had no chance of winning over the Democratic population at large. Sooner or later (with Kerry it may very well be later), the Dems need to wake up and realize they are flailing about in an identity crisis. That they have allowed themselves to become Republicans in dress and Democrats in name only is shameful. The Democratic Party needs an overhaul. Badly. Gore losing to Bush was plenty evidence. How many more Senators must they run out there to be slaughtered?  As many others opine, Americans do recognize that Bush has his failings, but many of those same Americans look at Kerry and wonder. And think, ummm, that's a haggard Al Gore with a big coif. The insincerity meter runs high around Kerry in comparison to Bush. And that meter often sways elections (no, really, it does!). Bush may be a word-fumbling dolt on stage but he's a sincere word-fumbling dolt on and off stage. Voters who have doubts will go for the sincere incumbent every time no matter how much he bungled things.   Kerry? Unlike rabble-rouser Howard Dean and his yyyyyyyyahp!ing, which in the long run  would  have been a positive, Kerry has said and done nothing to convince those "looking for a change" to look his way.    It has been 52 years since a convention really chose the candidate - when Democrats in Chicago nominated Adlai Stevenson. Over the next 40 years, conventions became the stage for presenting a running mate, as a way of keeping some interest in the event. Even that little gift of news has slipped away over the years; Mr. Kerry selected Mr. Edwards three weeks before the convention. Granted, the conventions are more about rallying and grooming but never (?) before were the early primary returns allowed to run roughshod over the entire primary process. The West Coast complains about early returns on the East Coast affecting elections, well, what about primaries?!   Thankfully, Edwards was named to the ticket. If it wasn't for him, I'd be voting same as I did in 1976, Mickey and Minnie Mouse.   Don't expect the DNC to change that matter. That is unless the Big Dems wisely allow John Edward to run the show from here on out. He is capable of reaching those seeking change. He is positive and upbeat. Kerry is a reminder of the past. A reminder of the shell the Democratic Party has become. Edwards is the future. Stumping will return. Speechmaking will return. But the candidate must be earnest. He must not be afraid to make mistakes. Kerry? Copies GW's advertising and doesn't differentiate himself in the least. He wouldn't want to do something the focus groups don't approve. He's a deer in the headlights. Rather, a deer in the bed of the Grand Ol Party's hemi.   This is jek and I approved this blog.  P.S. Edwards/Kerry

      This will likely be my last post until Monday, July 19th, as I will be on a road trip with my family around the Selkirk Mountains, and I don't have a laptop.  Oh, the shame!  In the meantime, I leave you with these few items:  1.   urlLink Update on Michael Moore's blog .   The pattern appears to continue as he's only made two posts since his July 4th launch.  I'm watching you, Mr. Moore.  2.   urlLink Saturn's rings .    Scientist believe Saturn's rings formed a few hundred million years ago when debris from colliding comets and moons was drawn into orbit around the planet by its gravitational influence.  I read this to a co-worker and she said it's pretty funny to her how scientists think they can really determine that a few hundred million years ago, given the vastness of space, that comets, which on earth we only get to see every 50 years or so, actually collided with moons and the debris resulted in the rings.  Science or science fiction?  3.   urlLink Sticks and stones will break my bones ...   I took real pleasure in reading about the sound ass-whoopin' the Bush administration received at a recent benefit concert that raised $7.5 million.   After celebrities raised $7.5 million with a concert for Democratic candidates John Kerry and John Edwards , an angry Bush campaign challenged their opponents on Friday to release a videotape showing performers calling the president a "liar" and a "cheap thug" during the show.  Actor Chevy Chase drew laughs and cheers from the Radio City Music Hall audience when he described politicians and their hobbies: "Clinton plays the sax, John plays the guitar, and the president's a liar." John Mellencamp sang "Let me tell you a story about the Texas Bandito," a tune that referred to Bush as a "cheap thug."  "If John Kerry is going to praise last night's star-studded hate fest and characterize it as the 'heart and soul' of America, he should share these values with voters everywhere," Bush-Cheney campaign manager Ken Mehlman said Friday in a statement. "We call on Kerry to release the video of this event so that all Americans can see what John Kerry has called America's 'heart and soul.'"   The Bushies hate bullies.  Now  that's  funny!

      Josh Marshall's got a  urlLink post  up today about news from Afghanistan concerning a mercenary of sorts who  "...was arrested with others for conducting a 'self-appointed counterterrorism mission that included abusing eight inmates in a private jail by hanging them by their feet.'"   Josh goes on to question what someone is doing operating a private jail, especially since it is very unclear who, if anyone, hired him.    His last paragraph reads:   It just seems like someone must have been paying this guy to do something, unless it's like a blog where you just set up shop and figure that someday a revenue stream might turn up.   Sure, I see the intended humor, but I find myself very uncomfortable with the comparison.    All in all, a disturbing story if you choose to follow the link to the ABCNEWS.com  urlLink page  it appears on.  Makes me think of all those movie moments when a CIA agent or Special Forces soldier is given an assignment, and when he is told that the mission is top secret, he responds,  "What mission, sir?"

       urlLink Wilco  has another great album out ( urlLink A Ghost is Born ), there's a lead story on Wilco and Jeff Tweedy in  urlLink Rolling Stone , and still so few people, it seems, appreciate what Wilco has accomplished.    From their inception and through the masterpiece  urlLink Summerteeth  , Wilco were master chefs, taking ingredients from their myriad influences and whipping them up into the yummiest of delicacies.   Homage  is a word that often comes to mind when listening to Wilco, since the musical references are so overt that it is impossible to label them as rip-offs.    Yet, what is most remarkable about the band is what they have done in their last two albums -  urlLink Yankee Hotel Foxtrot  and now A Ghost is Born.  What we've seen, or perhaps more appropriately heard, has been the metamorphosis from a band of masterful interpreters of classic pop/rock/country music, to the creators of their very own, unique sound.  Yes, the influences are still there, but they are now relegated to background filler or the occasional, brief keyboard or guitar lick.    It will be very exciting to watch where they will go from here.

      I don't know whether to be amused or disturbed by this  urlLink article  in Tuesday's (7/6/04) Washington Post.  On the surface it seems like a simple look at how silly things get in the world of domain names.  Six years ago, an Indianapolis bail bondsman, Kerry Edwards, created his own web domain -  urlLink www.kerryedwards.com .  According to the article, the day it was announced that Sen. John Edwards would be Kerry's running mate, Indianapolis Edwards was called by the Kerry campaign to discuss purchase of the domain name.  Apparently, the asking price was too high.  So, it seems like a fairly harmless, humorous human interest story.  Right?  Reading on we learn about other cybersquatters who have purchased domain names, hoping to cash in:   Other obvious choices for a campaign Web site – KerryEdwards04.com, KerryEdwards2004.com, KerryEdwards-2004.com and KerryEdwards2004.net – have already been registered, according to publicly available Internet records.   Yet, the disturbing part comes in this disclosure by one of these hopeful opportunists, Kevin Draftz of Chicago:   Draftz said his first choice of buyers is the Kerry campaign, but would not rule out selling them to the competition.   And we, or at least I, wonder what is wrong with democracy in America.    It's for sale.

      Hey, if you use Microsoft Internet Explorer, don't be a dope,  urlLink update it . And install  urlLink Spybot Search & Destroy ,  urlLink Spysweeper , AND  urlLink HiJackThis . Then run each of them.  If you want to try out other browsers, which I suggest, then I suggest  urlLink Firefox  or  urlLink Opera . Both have their  urlLink plusses and minuses  but both work well once you get used to them. Currently, I am trying to get used to Firefox and how it ain't so Google friendly (takes an extra click to access some of my favorite features like Blog This!, News, Images, Search This Site, etc. (Well, that's what I call the features. Google prolly has other, longer names.) Opera is fast but too many sites are "slightly" incompatible with it. And for quasi-neatniks, it can drive them batty.  If you don't have anti-virus protection, get  urlLink some . And if you get a buttload of spam, it is your own damn fault. You're too liberal. With where you poke your head. Porn and shopping and sites will be the death of your PC and/or your time.   If you are looking for a new media player, then I suggest  urlLink Media Center .  urlLink iTunes  (nearing 100M songs sold, BTW) is for kids. At least on Windows. It has too few features to be worth using. RealPlayer is for databases that need rebuilding and people who restart their PC several times a day. No link provided. If you are that stupid,  urlLink here .  urlLink Windows Media Player  is anti-mp3.  urlLink WinAmp  is for skin dweebs.  urlLink MusicMatch  is a better RealPlayer.  File this under: it's 1:27 AM and I've not posted squat here. Plus, I see Howard has simplified the look and wanted to let him know: Good job!  P.S.  urlLink Molly got WordPress! , which is where my 'poisonal' blog is going once I crawl out from under CSS and XHTML and  urlLink design guru wars .  Note to self: if I'd manage my time better, I'd... No, if I focused more, my time would not cover more yet not as much.  urlLink If that makes sense .  P.P.S. This blog appears different when viewed by MSIE (like the Blogger screenshot) or Firefox (no 'graphics', squared corners, poor type handling). Will be testing Opera soon.

        Spare the Rod, Save the Child Missouri's youth prisons focus on small groups, therapy, caring. Officials in California's punishment-oriented system are taking a look.   By Jenifer Warren Times Staff Writer  July 1, 2004  ST. JOSEPH, Mo. — There are no handcuffs, no razor-wire fences, no uniforms, no cells. Missouri does things differently in its prisons for young people, and it shows — in what you see and what you don't.  Inmates, referred to as "kids," live in dorms that feature beanbag chairs, potted plants, stuffed animals and bunk beds with smiley-face comforters. Guards — who are called "youth specialists" and must have college degrees — go by their first names and don't hesitate to offer hugs.  At the maximum-security lockup in St. Joseph, two cats, Midnight and Tigger, curl up on laps as the state's toughest teenage offenders explore the roots of their anger, weep over the acts of abusive parents and swap strategies for breaking free of gangs. At another facility in Kansas City, boys who rack up months of good behavior earn the right to attend summer basketball camp.  "The old corrections model was a failure; most kids left us worse off than when they came in," said Mark Steward, the chief of Missouri's youth penal system. "So we threw away that culture, and now we focus on treatment, on making connections with these guys and showing them another way…. It works."    urlLink This  is a must read, but it requires free registration, sorry.

      Very interesting  urlLink stuff  brewing in the African-American community.  Just when you thought it was the politically correct thing to do as a white male, to blame racism for the ongoing struggles of blacks in America, Bill Cosby upsets the apple cart and says there's no excuse.   During Thursday's speech, Cosby said his detractors were not facing the facts about poor black communities and were just trying to cover up what he called their "dirty laundry."   "Let me tell you something, your dirty laundry gets out of school at 2:30 every day, it's cursing and calling each other n----r as they're walking up and down the street," he said.   Cosby continued railing about the state of black youth in America. "They think they're hip," he said. "They can't read; they can't write. They're laughing and giggling, and they're going nowhere."   To African-American men, Cosby ranted, "Stop beating up your women because you can't find a job."   He complained about rap music: "When you put on a record, and that record is yelling 'n----r this' and 'n----r that' and cursing all over the thing and you got your little six-year-old and seven-year-old sitting in the back seat of the car--those children hear that. And I am telling you when you put the CD on and then you get up and dance to it What are you saying to your children?"   And he also ripped into sitcoms targeting African-American audiences: "Comedians coming on TV [saying,] 'I am so ugly, you are ugly, yuck, yuck.' That's all minstrel show stuff. I am tired of it."   "I can't even talk the way these people talk, 'Why you ain't,' 'Where you is'...and I blamed the kid until I heard the mother talk," Cosby said in May. "And then I heard the father talk...Everybody knows it's important to speak English except these knuckleheads. You can't be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth."   On Thursday, Cosby further elaborated his thoughts on the subject, saying once again that white people aren't to blame for teen pregnancy and high-school dropout rates.   "For me there is a time...when we have to turn the mirror around," he said. "Because for me it is almost analgesic to talk about what the white man is doing against us. And it keeps a person frozen in their seat, it keeps you frozen in your hole you're sitting in."    Easier said than done coming from a very wealthy man?  I don't know.  Does he minimize the very real impact of ongoing racism and socioeconomic inequality clearly held in place by a dominant white power structure?  Could be.  Does what he say have value?  No doubt.  It is not 'Uncle Tom' to take a hard look at how racism and inequality become internalized by the oppressed, to examine how this internalization often manifests as irrational, sometimes self-destructive behavior and cultural trends.    It took guts for Cosby to take this stance and I'm glad Jesse Jackson is supporting him.

      It's crap like  urlLink this  that gives hippies a bad name:   Rock musician David Crosby , founding member of the Byrds and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, pleaded guilty Friday to a gun charge, was fined $5,000 and sentenced to a conditional discharge.  The singer was arrested March 6 at the DoubleTree Suites Hotel in midtown Manhattan. Police said they found a Colt .45-caliber handgun, three clips of .45-caliber ammunition and two knives in his luggage.  Police also said the musician had a plastic bag containing an ounce of marijuana, a wooden container with a marijuana cigarette in it, a package of cigarette rolling papers and two other plastic containers with marijuana residue.   What a shame.  All the lovely music he's made and the mass movement of love and peace that he was a part of is overshadowed by the ridiculous behavior of an old drug addict.  Way to go, Dave.  More talking points for chronically uptight fascists in training.  There are no perfect humans that I know of.  For every David Crosby there's a  urlLink Jack Ryan.

      I have a new favorite website. The British newspaper  The Guardian  calls their site  urlLink   Guardian Unlimited   , which contains content beyond what they print on paper. Noteable for their news coverage from outside the American corporate media machine, but just as appealing for their British take on all things cultural, it's a great place to browse for information and entertainment.  The inspiration for this post came from reading two articles online today.   urlLink  Barred painter's open air nude show     urlLink  Naked women, cars and sports help doubles sales of mens mags    The irony, when these two pieces are juxtaposed, is so thick and delicious you can cut it with a knife and relish in licking the bowl.  Yet, what came to me when I read the second article is a much more serious issue - men being manipulated, mostly by other men. It never ceases to amaze me how transparent it all is. Dare watching commercial television for even a short while and you will be flooded with promises aimed at men that they will have more sex and more fun if they buy certain products or participate in certain activities.  Guys, wake up! Don't you see what's going on here? You are not that stupid. You are not Pavlovian dogs! Shouldn't you feel insulted, used, stereotyped? Doesn't it bother you that it's mostly men who are selling these products, trying to exploit for their own personal gain you, their fellow men and the fact that you have been conditioned to reflexively respond to images of scantily clad women, flashy cars, rich sports celebrities, etc.? Do you think they should be raking in the dough, living a life of luxury, while you shell out your hard earned cash on items you might not purchase if you thoroughly thought about the options available.  As an example and proof that I am in no way preaching a puritan lifestyle, let's look at beer.  Question: Why in the world would anyone mindlessly choose Budweiser, Miller, or Coors when they can be enjoying  urlLink  Boundary Bay  ,  urlLink  Pike  , or  urlLink  Fish Tail  ?  Answer: Boundary Bay, Pike, and Fish Tail will not use sexual or other manipulative imagery to sell their products. Oh yeah...and they actually taste good too.   (While some would argue that another main reason for choosing Bud, Miller, and Coors is that they are cheaper, I would respond that men could easily afford the more expensive brews if they weren't blowing so much money on all the other stuff they've been manipulated into buying.)   So, my fellow male Homo sapiens, rise above your caveman roots and join me in a toast, over a pint of Boundary Bay's Imperial Oatmeal Stout: To the liberation of all men from the Sirens-in-drag of modern advertising!  Gulp. Ahhhhh! Damn, that's good!

      On Sunday, I used the last of the beans in my apartment. On Monday, I made due with a cola. On Tuesday, I usually skip my coffee fix altogether, so I had forgotten to include beans in my day's errands. On Wednesday, today,  right now!  I am without coffee beans. Oh, the madness. Gives me a good excuse to walk the mile to the store before Seattle does yet another rendition of Miami with its too-hot-for-the-natives weather. Although, yes, I am not a native of Seattle, I do come from a 'colder' place, so I can play the trump card here, okay?! So, get off my back. I haven't had my coffee yet!  SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil has announced the creation of a coffee DNA data bank, which will help the country improve the quality and size of its coffee crop.  The announcement was made Tuesday by Agriculture Minister Roberto Rodrigues during a ceremony at Embrapa, country's agricultural research agency.  Over the past two years and at a cost of 6 million reals ($2 million), Embrapa and the Sao Paulo State Research Foundation worked on the Coffee Genome Project, which mapped 200,000 coffee DNA sequences, the Agriculture Ministry said in a statement posted on its Web site.   urlLink CNN  Well, thank gawd for that. Amongst the thirty beans or so that I use for my French press, there is always one or two beans that simply do not get with the program. Yay! No more hand sifting.  Oh, sure, I'll have to wait a few years and those coffee suppliers will still have to do a better job of keeping the medium roast beans far, far away from my dark roast, but I'll wait. But I need some -- rgxxxkckxsggrrrz -- coffee of the Mr. Hyde or Dr. Jekyll variety, I don't care,  right freaking now!

      A special thanks to  urlLink  BuzzFlash   for helping me start my day with a good laugh.      urlLink  Bush campaign holds rally in Va.; Dems sense weakness     Bush criticized Kerry's plan to eliminate the tax cuts for those making more than $200,000 a year, saying that "the rich in America happen to be the small business owners" who put people to work.   Bush also said high taxes on the rich are a failed strategy because " the really rich people figure out how to dodge taxes anyway ."

        Lombard's race is run  By Brendan Mooney  CATHAL LOMBARD has admitted to taking the performance enhancing drug Erythropoietin (EPO).  The 28-year-old Corkman will not contest the findings.  "I didn't set out to try and win medals or to make money. I just wanted to be as competitive as I could and have an equal chance with everyone else.   "I am not trying to justify what I did in any way; I am just saying this was the case, this is what I did and, hands up, I did it."   Lombard, whose honesty is a historic first, expressed his sorrow and apologised to everyone in advance of the pending statement from the Athletics Association of Ireland.  "I got a letter faxed to me on Friday from the Irish Sports Council informing me of a possible breach of the Irish anti-doping rules," he said.   urlLink Irish Examiner  - registration required, so see  urlLink New Zealand Herald   Ever since the line went beyond blurry to full-on, open use of professionals, the Olympics has been on a downward spiral. Now I do not care much if athletes use drugs or not, but if the rules forbid usage, then admit it. Come clean when caught. Of course, if judgment of rules abuse by the IOC is handled like the NCAA handles its issues, then many athletes are unfairly punished when taking something as simple as aspirin or cough medicine. Still, I gotta admire this Irish lad for his admission of guilt. Granted, he only deserves admiration because many, many athletes have long been denying their use of illegal substances.  Cathal, my next Guinness or Harp will be toasted your way. Sláinte!

      The key to moving towards  urlLink  energy independence   is to anticipate the knee-jerk reaction that the very powerful energy industry will have to any proposals that suggest a change to the status quo.  Listen, closely, you can almost hear them saying it now, "This policy will put thousands and thousands of Americans out of work!"  No, actually, your pathetic, short-sighted management of your companies, not planning for the inevitable need to develop new energy resources to position your companies for success in the future, will put thousands and thousands out of work.    Ever have that argument with a free market capitalist who says that there is nothing wrong with "big box" chain stores like The Home Depot coming to town and putting "Mom & Pop" hardware stores out of business?  What's their biggest argument?  "If Mom & Pop can't get creative and figure out how to compete, then it's survival of the fittest."    Any chance that this same free market capitalist would apply that same theory to, let's say, oil companies who claim that they will be put out of business by competing energy companies?    I didn't think so.  The truth is, regardless of how much environmentalists and anti-corporation activists despise the current energy industry, it makes no sense to propose policies that threaten these corporate giants.  If there is one thing that these companies are good at it's producing and distributing products to millions of consumers spread all over the globe.  Yes, production and distribution has been extremely destructive to the environment, but that is more a function of the toxic nature of the product than their business practices.    Kerry's plan, based on the scanty information available thus far, seems to understand the value of making the development of sustainable energy an attractive, money-making proposition for the energy industry.  Why reinvent the wheel when we can just make it a better wheel?  Will the energy companies still cry foul?  Yes, particularly because they are so financially and politically entangled in the Middle East.  However, given how badly it is going over there, while a U.S. President from an oil family presided over record-breaking gas prices, they may not have a leg to stand on.

      So, I've finally come up for air. I'm taking too many breaths. I've got so much to do. So much to say. See in the last month -- off and on when not becoming a born again digital virgin (that's right, the technological kid has come in from the analog storm (storms are good every now and again)) -- I've been swimming through  urlLink content management systems ,  urlLink blogware  (again and sticking with  urlLink WordPress ) and  urlLink web standards .  Before posting a lot about which you may have no interest in reading (then please skim!), know that this is all gonna see the light of day (sorta) at t-floss when its appearance starts to shift.  urlLink Brand identity , baby! (If anybody knows the title of the book Tom Peters co-authored about branding, published circa 1980, please let me know. It was a fantastic book that doesn't contain all the awful self-help language he employs these days. The dark side of success. And branding. Everyone copies you and the parody makes the original laughable. Sorta. Anyway...)  There is a lot to web standards and  urlLink accessibility . No more do web developers have to write six different pages for six different browsers. Mainly, they need to focus on 5% of the web's users who use standards-compliant browsers and then do some minimal hacking to accommodate the other 95%. Cough, Redmond, cough. Please make IE7  urlLink the best browser . :pray:  Anyway, thank gawd that the browser wars are (mostly) over. (Now, could we do something about our two-party political process! I'm all about the lack of standards when the two opposing parties are basically the same. Um, where was I?) That's right, back in the halcyon days of early 2001 when I took to the road, I tried to redesign my website from my car while doing 85 mph. Zogging while others thought zagging was cooler than zigging. Well, I quickly learned that my poor HTML 3 skills were not going to cut it out on the open road. That Adobe GoLive could only do so much and too much (bloated code). Too many of my friends were having difficulty browsing my site or even downloading it (not to mention uploading it from a 14k wireless modem). Well, the downloading/uploading problem was easily solved but the browser issues were another matter. I threw my hands in the air and awaited the web world people to get their act together.  The saddest bit about all of this is that the tools to obtain web standards, CSS (loosely: design) and XHTML (loosely: structure)*, were finally accepted in prime time when I eschewed my web presence back in late-Spring of 2001. I've lost three years! Had I been patient or not been so taken by, um, well her name is unimportant...  *Content can be achieved by a variety of means as can XHTML but it is all circular and above the reach of this post.   So, if you are interested in standards, I suggest stopping by the sites  urlLink A List Apart  and  urlLink Asterisk* , the latter seems to be the most focused blog on web design issues regarding standards.  Of course, I am only now crawling out from the waters of theory (read: I was reading books) and onto the land of practice (read: plowing through websites for quick tips as I quickly relaunch my personal website), so there is probably  urlLink a lot more out there  concerned with my standards interests (both arguments for and against) that I've not had enough time to read. Oh, but here's one funny, funny piece,  urlLink Gurus v. Bloggers 2  ( urlLink part one ), for those interested in the contradictions of 'practice what you preach'. Both these Design by Fire (DxF) articles have plenty of great websites listed.

      You know how it is.  It's 2 a.m. on a Saturday night.  Last call has come and gone.  Yes, there've been many identical nights like this one, out with friends sharing libations and that simple pleasure of camaraderie in our friendly neighborhood tavern.  Yet, to call these evenings ordinary was to overlook the priceless value they brought - the hours together, leaning on each other through the trials and tribulations of young adulthood, trying to make sense of all the pressures we felt from a world of parents and professors demanding a commitment to discipline, only sure about a few things - we liked each other, Rock & Roll music, cold beer in a cozy bar, and talking, as long as we could stay awake, about all our dreams.  Last call always came as a temporary let down until one of us casually said the inevitable, "Who's hungry?"    There's a new film coming out called  urlLink   Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle   , described as a late night road movie, the adventures of two guys from New Jersey who get the munchies and are compelled to get to a  urlLink  White Castle   restaurant at all cost.  Being from New Jersey and having actually spent a few late nights in college making my way to and from White Castle, I couldn't hold off the rush of memories that came to me, though the more I read about the movie it is clear that, the similarities to my experiences notwithstanding, the film really has nothing to do with me and my friends.  Beyond the obvious, that the two protagonists are from Indian and Pakistani heritages respectively, while we were all white, middle class, mostly Jewish suburbanites, perhaps the clearest difference lies in the real reason for finding a late night eating establishment after closing down the bar.  It never was about the food.    A film that comes closer to what I remember would be Barry Levinson's  urlLink   Diner   .  A  urlLink  summary   of  Diner  from that website goes like this:  Set in 1959, Diner shows how five young men resist their adulthood and seek refuge in their beloved Diner. The mundane, childish, and titillating details of their lives are shared. But the golden moments pass, and the men shoulder their responsibilities, leaving the Diner behind.  In preparing this post, I emailed some of my old friends, asking them to share their memories of our precious late night gab sessions over food.  They'll hate this, but perhaps the years have caught up with them because their responses, more accurately a pathetic lack of responses, initially made me question my own rose-colored-glasses look backward.  One friend who still lives in New Jersey wrote that he remembers waking up in the morning feeling terrible from having eaten at a greasy spoon called  urlLink  The White Rose System  , popular for it's artery-hardening burgers and for being open 24 hours.  It's true that we always blamed the burgers for how awful we felt the next day, in total denial that alcohol might have had anything to do with it.    Still I hadn't gleaned what I hoped from the old gang, so I had to rely on my own recollections.  Fortunately, there are many fond moments and places to choose from - burger joints and pizza parlors after the bars, diners and Denny's after concerts in the city, dives from New Brunswick to Manhattan just shootin' the shit.  Perhaps the reason why I didn't get a better response from my friends has something to do with geographical distance.  Whereas we used to all live either together or within minutes of each other, we are now spread across the country, in New Jersey, Arizona, California, and Washington State.    Yeah, something tells me that if we were all together, sitting around a pizza pie and pitchers of beer, the stories would flood the place.  That's what it was always about.

      A month ago I posted some  urlLink  commentary   on Bill Cosby's recent rants.  The Cos has been raising hell about how his fellow African-Americans, namely those living in poverty, are increasingly responsible for their lack of upward mobility.    As a follow-up, I highly recommend this excellent  urlLink  column   by none other than Henry Louis Gates, Jr. in the New York Times.  Gates draws on the Cosby comments as well as the now famous DNC speech of Barack Obama.  Here's a teaser:  Go into any inner-city neighborhood," Barack Obama said in his keynote address to the Democratic National Convention, "and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach kids to learn. They know that parents have to parent, that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white." In a speech filled with rousing applause lines, it was a line that many black Democratic delegates found especially galvanizing. Not just because they agreed, but because it was a home truth they'd seldom heard a politician say out loud.   Why has it been so difficult for black leaders to say such things in public, without being pilloried for "blaming the victim"? Why the huge flap over Bill Cosby's insistence that black teenagers do their homework, stay in school, master standard English and stop having babies? Any black person who frequents a barbershop or beauty parlor in the inner city knows that Mr. Cosby was only echoing sentiments widely shared in the black community.   (p.s. May this post serve as a not-so-subtle plug for the New York Times Online.  Yes it requires registration, but if there is any single publication worth going through the hassle of filling out and submitting a free registration form its this one.  If you don't like registering because you are worried about getting junk email, get a throwaway free Hotmail or Yahoo email account if you have to, but don't block yourself out of the Times for that reason alone.)

      A recent dialogue with my 6.75-year old son:   son: Dad, my friend said that it's illegal to light fireworks on a day that's not the 4th of July on Vashon Island.  hjm: Well, your friend's just a little off there.  It is illegal here in Bellingham, but not everywhere.  I think your friend's just acting like he knows everything.  son: Yeah.  hjm: Don't you think it would be boring to know everything?  There would be no mystery to life.  son: Yeah, but it could be useful.  (pause, holding back a chuckle, followed by immense pride and adoration)  hjm: True.  Still, I think it would get boring.  son: Yeah, like for detectives.  They wouldn't have any mysteries to solve.
