      Wendy and I went to Dr. Vic today. (psychotherapist)&nbsp; She went in first, then I went in.&nbsp; Dr. Vic said that Wendy's bad feelings have definitely intensified.&nbsp; He said she blames me for everything that is wrong with her.&nbsp; This was a terrible shock to me, as Wendy often tells me, "You're the best mother in the world."&nbsp; So which is it?&nbsp; He also said that I should not live&nbsp;in fear, and that Wendy's problems were bigger than either of us could handle or assess.&nbsp; He did not know what level of threat she presented.&nbsp; I had told him that Wendy was talking more and more often about getting so angry that she wanted to kill people.&nbsp; I don't know if this is a figure of speech or whether she would actually do it.&nbsp; And this is a horrible place for a mother to be.&nbsp; I am afraid of what is going on inside her brain. &nbsp; Dr. Vic told me that I must find a psychiatric social worker to assess whether Wendy could continue to live at home.&nbsp; I never even knew there were psychiatric social workers, nor where to find one.&nbsp; So tomorrow I have to start making calls.&nbsp; Craig said to start with calling Dr. S. (our psychiatrist)&nbsp; But ... what if someone tells me that she has to live somewhere else?&nbsp; Wendy would be miserable.&nbsp; She wants to stay at home with us.&nbsp; Dr. Vic said how do I know she will be miserable?&nbsp; What if she enjoys the structure and company? &nbsp; And where will we get the money? &nbsp; Craig has to go to court next Tuesday.&nbsp; His f***ing ex-wife is suing us again.&nbsp; Increased child support for Leo (because she lost her job, and supposedly can't find a new one) and resumed child support for Ariel, who moved back in with her.&nbsp; Apparently it doesn't matter to her that the MSA specifies that child support is to end when a child drops out of college (as Ariel did, when she was living with her 34-year-old boyfriend).&nbsp; I guess Ariel resumes being a child when she moves back in with her mother and goes back to community college.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Even though Craig says this is a cut-and-dried case (in our favor), I am still terrified about the outcome, because the first time we went to court, we lost, because the judge was an idiot, and ruled that it was okay for the witch's boyfriend to live in the house that we were paying for (via alimony and child support) because she "wasn't aware" that the situation would affect these payments, even though the MSA spelled it out.&nbsp; In other words, ignorance IS an excuse for breaking the law. &nbsp; Saw "Fahrenheit 9/11" tonight and cried.

      Had a comparably relaxing two days.&nbsp; Even pleasant.&nbsp; Last month I had entered a screenwriting competition in which entrants were randomly assigned a genre and subject, and had exactly one week to write a 20-page (or less) script.&nbsp; Last Saturday the genres/subjects were posted to the competition's web site, and today was the deadline to postmark the entry.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  My genre was "comedy" and subject was "plastic surgery".&nbsp; Craig suggested that I use my idea for the sexist guy who goes into the hospital for a vasectomy, and is accidentally given a sex change operation.&nbsp; I originally planned to write this as a feature-length script (and had written the first act several months ago), so the trick was to come up with an ending within 20 pages.&nbsp; Using a lot of what I already had, I was able to pound out the first 16 pages last Sunday.&nbsp; Today I finally had an epiphany about the ending, and finished by 6:30 tonight.&nbsp; So who knows, I might win something.&nbsp; There are only 11 contestants in my category.&nbsp; I figure writer's block and bad writing will rule out most of the other 10.&nbsp; Based on the screenwriting competition I used to direct, 99% of what people write is garbage.  &nbsp;  I had a pleasant lunch today with Jim K., former student (from 18 years ago!) and his new girlfriend.&nbsp; Somehow he tracked me down using Google and a search for "Lisa Wendy Shelby".&nbsp; I was a little apprehensive about how I would look so much older than the cute youthful teacher he remembered, but thought, 'What the heck, he's 18 years older too.'&nbsp; Well, I was delighted when I walked into the restaurant and he hugged me and said, "Lisa, you look exactly the same."&nbsp; Actually, he looked pretty much the same too, although much cuter than I remembered.&nbsp; And a doctor, no less.  &nbsp;  The conversation was a little awkward as I was trying to pull his girlfriend into the conversation, but she didn't have much to contribute.&nbsp; I hope she didn't notice that Jim was pretty much staring at me the whole time.&nbsp; He had that same bemused little smile that Rick used to get whenever he watched me.&nbsp; So okay,&nbsp;Jim must have had a big crush on me and maybe still does.&nbsp;&nbsp; When his girlfriend got up to go to the bathroom for the second time, I realized I'd better&nbsp;make my exit so they could continue their romantic weekend&nbsp;alone.&nbsp; Either that, or she has a weak bladder.&nbsp; Anyway, I was gratified to be, for exactly two hours today, the object of someone's long-term admiration.&nbsp; (well, besides Craig's)&nbsp; I of course immediately called Craig afterward and informed him that his wife's former student still had eyes for her, and he assured me that he was well aware of having such a good-looking wife.&nbsp;&nbsp; All together now:&nbsp; Awwwwww.

      Back in San Diego after four days in Las Vegas with Wendy, Shelby, and Esen.&nbsp; When you go on a trip with kids (that including teenagers), it is not so much a vacation as a field trip.&nbsp; They still need to be organized, fed, and entertained round the clock.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point I am regretting that I agreed to take a foreign exchange student for five weeks.&nbsp; Not because she is annoying, but because of every other crisis that is zapping me emotionally right now.  &nbsp;  While in Vegas I managed to go off on my own several hours to visit Rick's mother and step-father.&nbsp; Thank God they were home.&nbsp; I knocked on the door and Bob opened it and didn't quite recognize me.&nbsp; I said, "Bob, it's Lisa.&nbsp; Is Eve here?"&nbsp; So he took me back to the kitchen, and I saw Eve, and started crying, and she saw my face and realized I knew about Rick, so she started crying, and we just hugged and hugged each other.&nbsp; We finally sat down and she began the long horrible story of what happened to Rick.  &nbsp;  As I guessed, Rick's problem began right after Mother's Day, about May 13.&nbsp; (My last email from him was May 10)&nbsp; He was feeling terrible pain in his lower back, so his wife took him to the emergency room.&nbsp; He had a slipped disc, or herniated disc, something like that.&nbsp; They put a pain patch on his lower back and sent him home with his wife, apparently not telling her about the pain patch.&nbsp; Now, this pain patch never should have been used.&nbsp; This was something that was only used on cancer patients and others who had grown immune to every other pain killer.&nbsp; Not only that, but it was the maximum strength.&nbsp; The lowest dose was 25.&nbsp; They gave him 100.  &nbsp;  At home, he slept the next 36 hours, and his wife was only able to wake him for very brief periods.&nbsp; She finally called the paramedics.&nbsp; As they were transferring him from his bed to the stretcher, he went into massive cardiac arrest.&nbsp; It turns out that the pain patch had lowered his blood pressure so drastically that he barely had any circulation.&nbsp; Bear in mind that I am not a physician and I am only relating what I can remember, and I was absolutely horrified as I was hearing this story.  &nbsp;  This is going to be a long post I'm afraid.  &nbsp;  When they got Rick to the hospital, they put him on full life support.&nbsp; To make a long story short, they told his wife and mother that if he survived he would have brain damage and be blind.&nbsp; However, over the next few weeks he regained consciousness.&nbsp; He opened his eyes and asked his mother, "What happened to me?"&nbsp; It seemed as though he would recover.&nbsp; But then, he began having seizures.&nbsp;&nbsp; His immune system was so zonked that he caught the super-flu.&nbsp; And apparently this is what finally killed him.&nbsp; After six weeks, he passed away on June 29, two days before his 47th birthday.  &nbsp;  I cannot tell you how shocked, sad, and angry I am.&nbsp;&nbsp; I consider this murder on the part of the doctor who put the pain patch on him.&nbsp; Rick's wife will sue for malpractice and I hope she wins.&nbsp; I hope that doctor loses his license.&nbsp; This never should have happened.&nbsp; The ironic thing was, Rick never trusted doctors.&nbsp; He would always tell me, "Fifty percent of the doctors graduated in the bottom half of their class."  &nbsp;  And I cannot get Rick out of my head.&nbsp; It has been a week, and the memories do not go away.&nbsp; They just get more vivid.  &nbsp;  Rick's mother and step-father invited me to lunch.&nbsp; They were always so wonderful and kind.&nbsp; Over lunch, I showed her the pictures of Rick and me that I had accumulated over the three years we were (mostly) together.&nbsp; She was so happy to see those pictures.&nbsp; She told me how grateful she was that I came, and that Rick was such an important part of my life.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Thank god I did not throw those photos away.&nbsp; I found out several things.&nbsp; A few of the photos were taken at Julia Pfeffer Burns State Park in Big Sur.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eve said, "Oh, Rick took us there.&nbsp; He told us that you made him promise never to take another girlfriend there, and he hasn't."&nbsp; Of course, that made me start crying all over again.&nbsp; Another photo was of a street artist in San Francisco who made paintings using spray paint and can lids.&nbsp; Eve said that Rick had begged her on her last trip to San Francisco to please find that street artist and buy one of those paintings.&nbsp; She looked everywhere and even asked other street artists, but couldn't find him.&nbsp; Eve and I looked at each other, realizing that Rick had intended to send that picture to me.  &nbsp;  I was gratified to know that he still thought of me.&nbsp; I guess I already knew that, because he kept emailing me.  &nbsp;  I told Eve and Bob about how after we broke up, Rick opened a brokerage account in my name using my social security number and forging my signature.&nbsp; He invested some money and built it up to about $3500.&nbsp; Apparently he intended to build it up to quite a bit, and then turn it over to me.&nbsp; But at the end of the year he got the 1099-DIV and realized that I would be in big trouble with the IRS if I didn't declare this on my income tax.&nbsp; So he had to 'fess up and mail everything to me.  &nbsp;  I guess that was the point that I finally stopped ignoring his emails, and we began our correspondence.&nbsp; At one point he asked, "Will I ever see you again?"&nbsp; I wrote back with one word: "No."&nbsp;&nbsp;I was to marry Craig in April, and he went on to marry Carolyn in August. &nbsp;  This is going to sound terrible, but the one thing I can take satisfaction in is that Rick died longing for me.&nbsp; I know he loved his wife, but the absent one is always the one who becomes idealized.&nbsp; In a sense I am doing this with Rick now that he is dead.&nbsp; I have to force myself to remember all the rotten things he did too, like cheating on me with Caroline.&nbsp; And I have to remember that Craig is my true love, the one who cares for me AND my daughters.&nbsp; Damn Craig for being gone all this week at that stupid Juggling Convention.&nbsp; If he were here, I wouldn't spend so much time absorbed with Rick.&nbsp;&nbsp; I need my Craig.  &nbsp;  To further mess with my head, when I returned&nbsp;to the hotel room after&nbsp;visiting Eve and Bob, Shelby announced, "Wendy has been talking to Rick."&nbsp; Wendy promptly produced a letter that she had done using her "guided writing" (which is where one communicates with, and writes down the words of, a dead person).&nbsp; I sat down and started reading the letter and began to cry all over again.&nbsp; Because it sounded like Rick's words.&nbsp; Either that, or Wendy has an uncanny memory of details that occurred over six years ago.&nbsp; One phrase that stood out was "my precious Math teacher".&nbsp; Rick always called me precious.&nbsp; But&nbsp;this was&nbsp;always during private moments.&nbsp; &nbsp;How could Wendy know that?&nbsp; Coincidence?&nbsp; I have never had a boyfriend or husband call me "precious" except Rick.&nbsp; It was always "sweetie", "sweetheart", "honey", or "babe".&nbsp; Today on the drive home I asked Wendy, as she was waking up from a nap, "Wendy, do you remember what Rick's pet name for me was?"&nbsp; She said, "No."&nbsp; I pressed, "Do you remember what he used to call me?&nbsp; A nick name?"&nbsp; She said, "No."  &nbsp;  So now, I have to consider that Wendy may in fact be psychic, and not schizophrenic.&nbsp; If people believe in God, including me, aren't spirits in the realm of possibility?  &nbsp;  Yesterday I was wandering around the "Dessert Passage" shops in Aladdin while the girls were off shopping.&nbsp; Of course, I was lost in thoughts of Rick, when suddenly I realized what song was playing in the b.g.: "As I lay me down to sleep" by Sophie B. Hawkins.&nbsp; This was a special song that Rick and I shared.&nbsp; Another coincidence?&nbsp; No, at that point I firmly believed that Rick was sending me a message that he was a spirit now.  &nbsp;  Well, this is enough for today.&nbsp; I'm glad to be home, even though Skittles peed all over the carpet.

      Was sad all day today. Last night I asked Craig if he would mind if I attended Rick's memorial service today. Craig said that was fine, that he was not the jealous type. But this morning he told me that he thought I shouldn't go, that I should focus on the living (Wendy, Shelby, and the foreign exchange student) and not the dead. And that six years had already gone by, meaning this was in the distant past. (To me, it was like yesterday)   I knew that Craig was right, so I made plans to take the girls shopping down in San Diego. But all day I was filled with an unexpected deep sadness, and memories of things Rick and I had done together. We were only together on and off for three years, and most of it was tumultuous, but we had a deep bond. I don't know why I loved him, I just did. And I really can't believe he is gone. It's like someone made a mistake, whether it was God or karma or whatever.   I tried calling the coroner's office to find out why he died, but the woman who answered the phone didn't understand the lab report, so she told me to call back tomorrow and talk to the doctor.

      Was reading the paper tonight and came across my ex-boyfriend Rick's photo on the obituary page. My first thought was, "This is a weird joke someone is playing." Or, "maybe they have the wrong guy's name and photo".   I don't know how this happened. I read the obituary through two or three times. Mentioned his wife and 3-year-old son, but not how he died. My guess is it was either cancer (because his father died from cancer) or a car accident. I'm leaning toward the latter. He had a red ferrari and I know he liked to drive like a race car driver. He got in a serious accident about 10 years ago when he was married to his first wife.   The other weird thing is, I used to get an email from Rick a couple times a month, asking me how I was doing, etc. Sometimes he told me about outings he took his son on. Sometimes he attached photos. I would respond within a week, but he always answered my emails the very next day. The last email came May 10. When I didn't hear from him for a few weeks, I wrote him and asked what was going on, was everything all right. Still no word. Two weeks later I wrote again and told him I was worried, and to please write and let me know everything was okay. No answer. So I assumed that his wife somehow found out he was emailing me, and told him to stop. So I respected this (apparent) decision on his part, and did not contact him again. I felt it was for the best anyway, as Rick needed to stop thinking about me and dedicate himself to his marriage.   You may think I have a big head, thinking that&nbsp;2 or 3&nbsp;emails a month from a guy meant he was obsessing on me. But I know Rick better than anyone, and I know he was obsessive-compulsive, especially about women who walked out of his life. All the time he was with me, he mooned over his first wife. Then, when I broke up with him, he sent me emails telling me that he finally stopped obsessing on Candace, that now he was obsessing on me. (well, too bad he couldn't get it in sync. I figured this was his new girlfriend's problem, not mine.) Rick was a deeply depressed man. I tried to repair him by loving him, by being the perfect girlfriend, but it wasn't enough. He needed another girlfriend for the weekends I couldn't be with him. Endlessly needy.   Yet, he cared about me. It's been almost six years since we broke up, and both of us have remarried, and still he wrote to me religiously. I got used to being "the woman he obsessed about". So now he's gone and I feel the absence, even though I haven't seen him in years or heard his voice. There's no Rick out there thinking about me. This is totally self-centered, I know. The real tragedy is the wife and little boy he left behind. The tragedy is that this haunted man never enjoyed the good things right in front of him. A sad life cut very short.   I used to fantasize about running into him some day, one of those bittersweet cinematic moments where the ex-lovers cross each other's paths, and make stiff, polite conversation, all the while fighting the need to hug one another and cry. I guess I'll never have that moment.

      Today I took our foreign exchange student, plus another foreign exchange student from Austria staying with a different host family, to the Wild Animal Park.  This was the first time the two girls met, and they got along instantly.  What a relief for Esen to finally find someone with whom to converse in German.  I had to take Wendy with us, because Craig had to go to a meeting, and we did not want to leave her alone.  When we got back, Wendy tried doing another spell in the backyard lighting another piece of paper on fire.  The fire immediately got big enough to be worrisome, so she came to me for help putting it out.  She says that she is through lighting papers on fire, and will only light candles.  We stressed that this can only be under our supervision, when one or both of us is at home.  I got upset with Wendy at the Wild Animal Park when she told me that she tried to use her debit card at the gift shop, and it got rejected.  This is the 5th, and she gets her SSI payment on the 1st, which means she managed to spend $550 in less than 5 days.  Wendy couldn't figure out how where the money went, so when we got home I called the credit union and it turns out that she had purchased something on the internet, and the company preauthorized too much money, which was released back to Wendy later today, so she actually has a balance of about $78.  I wanted to take Wendy to an introductory Kabbalah meeting tonight, to try to get her into a more "mainstream" spirituality - something that does not involve candles and spells - but she tried on some pants and got extremely upset because she could not fit in them, so I told her to take a walk instead.  I have not heard anything from Dr. Castillo's office about the biopsies.  I don't even know where she took them from, it looked like she was scraping my uterus.  The last thing I need right now is cancer.

       This is the handwritten letter Wendy brought down to me, after our talk.    Dear Mom   I would like to say, I am really sorry for what happened.   I suffered alot after being depressed.  So I am so happy, I feel I can get away with too much.   I was vain.  I was very impatient.  I wanted my hobbie to work.  I have "friends" on the other side.   They tell me I can get friends in the real world - they see me for who I am.   So I talk to them alot.  I asked them to give me power.   I am very upset I hurt you.  I only tried to help myself.    I want other friends.  Very bad.  But you seem to be the only one who cares.   I should not have let this out on you.  I am strong, and will make more friends.  I am shy, thus I need help from the other side.   Only under your supervision will I ever succeed in any thing I do.   Wendy

      I oscillate between despair, denial, and cautious optimism.  Wendy seems to be in better spirits the last few days, since coming home from her father's.  I really thought we got through to her that she must never lie to us again, and that she must obey the house rules.  But tonight she tried to do another spell in her room involving setting a piece of paper on fire.  Of course, the fire got bigger than the dish containing it, and we ran up there when we smelled the smoke.  Again, Craig and I had to reiterate that she is not allowed to burn things in her room, and that if she wants to burn things outside, one of us has to supervise.  What upsets me most is that she knew she was not supposed to do this, but she did it anyway because she wanted the right to "get closer to her gods".  She feels we don't understand her religion, whatever that is  - wiccan I guess.    I told her that if she lies or goes behind our back one more time, I am sending her back to her dad's.

      Wendy, Shelby and I visited Dad at the hospital tonight.  It took an hour and a half to get to Riverside.  I told him next time to go to the Kaiser in Escondido.  Anyway, he looked fine, but they gave him a lot of tests to figure out why his heart is racing and he's getting shortness of breath.  He may come home tomorrow, but probably Wednesday.  I really hope they can figure out what's wrong with him.  I chatted with Anna Mae again tonight, and I told her how snotty Ellie was on the phone with me last night.  She said Ellie had no business to talk to me that way.  She also said that when she was visiting my dad last night in the emergency room, she announced she was "furious with Lisa".  I asked Anna Mae why she could possibly be furious with me?  Anna Mae said that Ellie thought I should have rushed up there the second I heard my dad was admitted to the emergency room.  Of course I would have if Anna Mae had told me to, but Anna Mae told me that he was fine, and not to even call him for a few more hours.  So, once again, Ellie is trying to drive a wedge between me and my dad.  And for what?  I already bought the house, and his investments are dwindling, so what can she hope to get out of him?  I wanted to call Ellie and give her a piece of my mind for badmouthing me in front of my dad, but Anna Mae asked me please not to, because then Ellie and my Dad would know I found out from her.  And that this was not a good time, because of my dad being in the hospital.  So I promised her I wouldn't say anything right now.  Still having problem with the check from ETS that was bounced by Wells Fargo.  ETS's bank Wachovia said they already paid the check, Wells Fargo said they never got the money for the check, and ETS says it's my problem.  This has been going on since late June.  I left a nasty message with ETS when I got home from school today telling them that I am taking them to Small Claims Court if I don't get a new check in two days.  I cannot believe that in this day and age of electronic transactions, that money can simply be lost and unaccounted for.  It's only $107 but I want my freaking money.  Craig retained attorney today.  And so the games begin, anew.

      The past 10 days has been relatively peaceful and stress-free. Shelby spent the week visiting her aunt, uncle, and cousins in TN. Wendy even spent a few days at Popi's. All I had to do was a few of the usual errands - getting Shelby registered at VCHS, etc. In the evenings we planted some desert plants in the back yard.  Back to school tomorrow for 7 days of teacher inservice (which seems excessive). One day meeting with my new group (the 10th Grade team), two days of new teacher inservice, and four days of school-wide inservice. I hate these things. They take two hours to step you through a manual that you could read on your own. Maybe this is so teachers can experience firsthand what students feel.  My dad's neighbor Anna Mae called tonight to tell me she brought him to the emergency room. He was experiencing severe pain in his chest, and around his back. Plus, his heart has been racing for about a week now. (He saw his doctor on Tuesday, who changed his prescription) So, he has three kidney stones plus they want him to stay in ICU for a few days to monitor his heart. I talked to him briefly and he sounded in good spirits.  Ellie (his ex-girlfriend) just called to tell me to come to his house tomorrow morning to pick up his shaving kit, toothbrush, and mints, to take to him at the hospital in Riverside. (which is an hour drive from here) I told her I had to work tomorrow, but would be happy to bring them up to him when I got off work in the afternoon. In the meantime, he could buy a toothbrush from the hospital pharmacy for $1.99. She immediately guilt-tripped me with "Well, I'll just bring it up to him tomorrow because he'll need these things. But you'll need to go see him tomorrow night." (Thanks, you bitch, for telling me what to do.)  I really hate her. And I hope my dad will be okay.  The judge deferred Craig's case with ex-wife til September.  We have decided to retain a lawyer to help him, because even though he does a good job writing down all the facts, it takes a lawyer to know all the procedural crap.  He found a lawyer who said that we are going to deposition the ex so that she can reiterate her lies under oath, on tape.  Cost of Retaining Lawyer: $6,000-$8,000 Cost of Getting Ex-Wife off our Backs: Priceless
