      Oh my goodness today was so restful! It was sooo wonderful to sleep in, even though I was on my couch since I didn't feel like cleaning off my bed last night. For all that my apartment was cleaner than I've had it in a while, I had packed so frenetically that I had clothing and stuff thrown everywhere on my bed... good thing I love sleeping on my couch.  I didn't get out of my pajamas until 6:30 tonight. It was soooo wonderful to just lay on the couch and talk to friends and nap. But today was Venitian Night, and I just love the fireworks. For anyone who's not from Chicago, Venetian night has been going for over 50 years, and it has a boat parade and fireworks that all go along with a theme, and the fireworks are simply awesome. They use a lot of new fireworks, which is always exciting, and they're choreographed quite well with the music. Very fun. It was good for me to get dressed and get out of the apartment too. I think I'm going to make sure that I get out of the house every day this week... it's so great to not be stuck in a building all day!!

      My goodness, it was hard for me to leave Texas!! What a crazy emotional day I've had. I slept through my alarm, almost had a heart attack when I saw what time it was, and then I saw the bill that had been slipped under my door and in my not-really-cognizant state thought it was somehow an internet bill or something... and I started to cry, cause I don't have the money to pay for that sort of thing! Fortunately a call to the front desk cleared it all up, but goodness... It just really threw me off for the whole day, so when I got to work I was about ready to burst into tears anyway.  Fortunately I did a pretty good job of not crying. Darn you, awesome people in Addison... making it hard for me to leave!!!!  The last day is always the worst too, because you're torn between wanting it to never end, and wanting to just leave already and be done with the goodbyes.  It was so great having people sad to see us go. Believe me, you guys, if I could stay longer, I would have. But now I'm back at my old store for a week, and then off to the suburbs to open another store. I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do this--start all over again! I had no idea that more draining than the physical aspect of just standing for so many hours would be the the emotional aspect. It's tough getting to know people, getting invested in them, and then leaving! So please, please keep in touch, all of you. I want to know how you're doing and what you're up to.   I've had an awesome time, and if I'm able to come back to Dallas I'll be sure to come visit!

      There is something simply mahvelous about sitting in a hot bubbling hot tub while a nice cool rain is coming down. Of course, after a few minutes I did realize that sitting in water underneath a sky that was occasionally sparking lightning may not have been a good idea... but it was a very decadant feeling, all hot and cold at the same time.  My life seems to be hot and cold right now. I'm sooo very sad that I'm leaving Texas. I'm going to miss you, my Ducklings! I promised Matt I'd write about him today, so here you go honey. I LOVE your MoviePhone voice, and the fact that you let me make fun of you all the time. I love that you call me Mamma Duckling even though there's really no such thing. (But I call baby geese "gooseletts" so who am I to be picky??) I'm going to miss standing between you and Mike and quoting from Holy Grail and Office Space. (Mike, if you're reading this I'm gonna miss you too!) I'm so proud of all of you for everything you've learned, and for being able to run the store on your own now! It was a great feeling today, not having to jump in all the time, and seeing everything come out just perfectly.  I'm going to miss all the great managers... Katie who has the best sense of humor, Pam with her great fashion sense, Addam who always smiles when I call him "Brother Addam", and Darrell, who could talk water uphill but is such a great guy.  I'm going to miss all the Texas accents, how everyone sounds so nice and friendly. I'm gonna miss people saying "I'm fixin' to..." and "I've done gone and..." and "y'all."  Sigh. It's so sad for me right now. I've really gotten to know a lot of y'all, and I don't want to leave. I'm so very glad for email, since we can still keep in touch.   But on the other hand, there is a part of me that is ready to leave, to see my kitty again, and be back on my own computer so I can upload some of my photos. I can hardly wait to watch Ever After, and yes I do think it was funny that I bought the DVD at Target here and have to schlepp it home before I can watch it...but I'm so glad I finally own it!   And I'm looking forward to doing more store openings, to getting better at training and inspiring people. I want to develop relationships with the people who make the big decisions, and be able to help them come to those decisions. I want to have a job like Mike Ganino's. And I'm looking forward to&nbsp;meeting the other Dream Team members, and getting to know everyone better.  I'm also really looking forward to only working 14 hours next week. How funny that last Monday I worked 14 hours in one day, and this week it'll be over three days. But there won't be any complaining from me. I'm very much looking forward to being able to luxuriate in bed, and renew my relationship with the great city of Chicago.  But believe me, I will miss everyone. I'm sorry for all the times I was snippy, and I hope you remember me with some degree of fondness. I'm gonna miss you, Chrissy, all the way out there in Ann Arbor. I hope to see you at another opening, and if I get a chance to go to Grand Rapids I'll make an extra effort to get out to see you.   So, farewell and goodbye my Ducklings and my honorary Ducklings. Please keep in touch, and make sure to have a good time at work. If it's not fun, it's not worth it, and it really is easy to make it fun, especially since you won't have people hovering over you quite as much.  I'll miss Texas, although I may not miss the weather. And I'll miss each and every one of you from Addison who are reading this right now.  Peace.

      I am in love with Texas in the rain, When the heat, that God-awful (and awe-ful)  heat stops for a minute and waits, patiently, for the rain and the thunder to roll over me like a warm wet blanket tingling against my skin like it were hot but not instead it's cold and clammy and my hands and feet start to freeze and I actually for once, unbelievably begin to think that it's not so hot down here in Texas.

      Ok, so anyone who knows me will smile and nod as they read this because they know that I develop crushes on people like there's no tomorrow. This guy, that one, any guy who will stop and talk to me for more than two minutes. (Ok, I'm not  quite  that bad.)  So,&nbsp;I just want to start by saying that I am sooo very grateful to La Quinta hotel for employing Bret (with one "t") at their front desk, because he is just way too much fun to talk to. After spending 10-12 hours a day with the same people--who, for the most part, I absolutely  love --I can get sick of them. Or at least, sick of the idea of working together, and  then  hanging out. But that doesn't necessarily mean I want&nbsp;to go sit in my room by myself.  So what I do, lately, is stand by the front desk, and talk to Bret. He's pretty cute, and funny in that quirky way I like, and a perfectly good crush because I probably won't see him again (although it is sad since after getting to know someone over a three-week time span, you really can't imagine just  leaving  them.) But I'll take what I can get, and even though he's probably nice more because that's his personality and because&nbsp;talking to me is better than staring at the wall all night, I've been really enjoying the time. And there's nothing wrong with a little harmless flirting, right?  So, Bret (with one "t"), thanks for being such a great conversationalist. I love our talks, and I'll miss ya--especially if my next hotel doesn't have any cute front desk guys.

      Ok, I think that footrubs should be included in my "perks" for standing all day. I remember the first few days that I worked when four hours felt like eight, and eight hours sent me home to take a nap on my couch. Then that first twelve-hour day came up... and another one, and soon I found myself coming home and putting a hotpad on my back, ice on my knees, and filling a foot tub for my poor swollen feet.  How on earth could people do this regularly?  I wondered.  Of course, now I know. But then it hasn't been too bad. Actually, worse than the standing is just the fact that I'm spending my  whole day  in the same building. Get up, get showered, get dressed, eat breakfast, get to work, stand...stand...sit and eat... stand...stand... go home, check email, update blog, go to bed, get up, get showered... (wait a second... did I skip dinner? why, yes I did!)  And I'm not trying to be whiny here. I absolutely love this. I guess I'm just having a rough couple of days, and it's hard to stay smiling and keep everyone happy and working quickly and cheerfully, and my hormones are simply  killing  me right now. In the course of just a few minutes I swing from ultra-happy to wanting someone--anyone--to give me a huge hug so I can just  cry .   On the plus side, I had two people tell me that I'm their favorite trainer today. Of course, I haven't trained them specifically, so they probably don't realize how much I've been snippy with my own people (not that I've meant to be!). But it still made me feel really good to know that people like me. :)   I'm gonna miss all my ducklings. My very first opening... I'm sure I'll remember it for a long, long time. Hopefully with fondness, and not too much embarassment (stupid thumb). I only hope that I'm having a postitive impact on everyone I've worked with. Because that's what&nbsp;makes all the long, footrub-less days worth it.

      I am soooo grateful to Jean for lending me the laptop on which I'm typing. But I truly wish we'd remembered the external mouse, because the tiny little directional rubber thing above the "b" is absolutely psycho. It's not a huge problem when I'm just doing email, but I brought along a couple of games to play on days like today when I'm too restless to read and too lonely to just go to bed. But one of my games is a variation (an extremely updated variation) on Pong, and it's totally necessary to have a working mouse! I kept getting horridly low scores because I couldn't control the paddle accurately. But I kept plugging along, and after a week of not coming close to 8,000 points, I finally did very well... 21,000! Isn't it crazy how that works? The down side, however, is that my entire right hand is cramped up. Man... Guess I'd be better off just going to bed now.

      Never take knife safety for granted. If you forget to cover knife safety, you  will  cut yourself. In front of the new trainees. And it will hurt, and bleed, and make you feel like an absolute ass. And then, when you go to the back for a band-aid, you will gesture wildly because you can't tell your manager the story without moving in broad sweeping motions, and then you will cut your  other  freakin' arm on something. And then you will laugh because crying would just compound the problem because no matter how much you want to go home, you could really use the money from another hour of work, and if you start crying they'll definitely send you home. So you suck it up, and file it away for a teaching example for the future, and you hope to God that after you leave, everyone will remember you for anything but the fact that you sliced your thumb open while teaching someone the proper way to cut a piece of bread.

      Giving a massage can be just as relaxing as receiving one. Well, OK, not necessarily JUST as relaxing, but pretty darn close, if you can enjoy it. I love giving massages, because it gives me a chance to connect with people on a level that most relationships don't get to.&nbsp; It also makes me attuned not just to their body, but to my own as well, because as I'm kneading one muscle just below the shoulder blade...right...there... I'm feeling it on my own back as well. The best way to give a massage is to remember what other people have done to you, or just take a mental look around your own body to muscles and sore spots, and do what you would want done to you. It's the Golden Rule for rubbing other people. Mahvelous.

      I'd like to begin with a discourse about a bird.  Not just any bird, but the pidgen who was perched outside my hotel window just a few minutes ago. He was my inspiration for creating this site. Because... he is freedom and movement. Picture this: a window with white semi-see-through curtains, beyond which is a faux railing, a large bush with tiny pink flowers swaying in the wind, and farther back a line of trees, a building whose exterior is completely greenish glass, and then a blue-and-white dappled sky. Then a gentle cooing and flapping and down comes the bird. He looks briefly through the window as if it were created to let creatures see in instead of people seeing out. He bobs his head, walks back and forth as if deciding whether to put up residence, and I freeze, capturing the moment in my mind. Here, though my window, I can see evidence of Man, God, Nature, Creature--all rolled up into one quasi-two-dimentional mental snapshot.  And so, instead of walking down the hallway to get my laundry, I write.

      I really wish that I was unemployed for this 2 week stretch of time. Not because I hate my job, and certainly not that I want to not make any money, but there is something nice about the idea of being able to just glue myself to the Olympics. I love them so much. I would watch them every day... I really would. Even the stuff like archery and basketball.  Since today was my day off, I took the chance to sleep in (until someone who will remain nameless called me... hopefully that someone will also learn that my days off do NOT start until noon). Then I watched the Opening Ceremonies. Yes, I taped the opening ceremonies. Why? Because the nominal ideals of the Olympics--celebrating peace, competition and sport in its purest sense--are inspiring. I just love the symbolism of the rings, the anthem that gets sooo overplayed, and the last great lighting of the torch.  The broadcast started with a video with the voice of James Earl Jones giving the introduction. I cried. I did. I cried throughout most of the ceremony. Why? Because it was so... eloquent. The images, the music, the stories that Bob and Katie told of athletes whose one and only chance of glory was probably walking through the stadium, not actually winning a medal. I cried to see the response that the US got from the Greeks, the cheers for the Palestinian and Iranian and Iraqi teams... the flags that the French held that had the Grecian flag on the opposite side. The laurel wreathes that each medal winner is presented with. The hope, the truce, the goals and ideals that are fresh and new and attainable... where everyone has the potential to do their best. The good sportsmanship between men and women who gave their all but recognize that their opponant just performed better.  And believe me, I will tape the closing ceremony if I'm not going to be at home to watch it. And I will cry again, for the extinguishing of the torch, the end of those great two weeks when men and women are citizens of the world more than just of their own countries... for the harsh return to a reality where most of us are no more aware of others than we are of ourselves, our real selves.  So I will cry, and I will not be ashamed.

      Ok, so my foot still hurts like crazy, but today at work was much, much better. I was even able to have a little fun, and I think my people did too. And that really helped. I'm still not as fun and exciting as Mike and Jeni, but at least I feel a little more like I belong, and I can improve.  On a completely different note...  Do you ever feel like your body isn't real? Like today I was in the Cheesecake Factory, and I was waiting for a stall in the bathroom when I saw my reflection in the mirror. And I was like, who is that huge girl?? I do NOT really look like that! I felt thin... so shouldn't I look thin?? ANd I know it bugs my friends when I complain--or at least when I complain and then don't do anything about losing weight--but I just hate it when I realize what I look like. I know that people don't find me repulsive, but still...  And then a friend of mine told me she's finally gotten down to a size 10 pants, which she hasn't worn in 10 years. I'm very happy for her, really... and quite proud of her for being so dedicated to working out and eating well, but it was really disappointing to realize that in December I set myself a goal of losing weight... and instead I've gained it. I'm sure it's all those cookies and milkshakes... stupid wonderful milkshakes. Sigh.

      I can not begin to express how much my foot hurts right now. Well, I suppose I could "begin" to express it. Everyone can "begin" something. But to be able to encapsulate in words just how much it hurts? No... I don't think I'll be able to do that.  And I didn't even win this morning! You know that game, right? Where everyone has to prove that they're having the worst day imaginable? I woke up with a painful foot--but then certain other people woke up having a noxious diabetic moment. Lovely. There went my award ceremony. Kat was all ready to do the honors as well--how I love pity!!--and then I had (yes  I had ) to go and tell her who really should have won. Sigh. We had to have my name sanded off the trophy and get it re-engraved. It was a very sad moment--I was slighty proud because I was thinking of someone else's pain above my own--but sad nonetheless.  Today was also very frustrating. My foot, my lack of sleep (thanks Megen for calling me at midnight) and just not quite being able to grasp the ropes of this new job. I mean, I guess it's a good thing that after the first day training on my second opening I was able to realize things I was doing that didn't work either time, and be able to address it, but it's really tough having to listen to a whole group of people telling me what to do--things that were so common-sense I was almost insulted at the insinuation towards my intelligence level. Yes, yes, I got some great direction and I'm very very grateful for it!! It just made me feel like crap to know that during a time when we were all asked how things were going, I was the only person who said I had a problem and needed help. It made me feel like the only reason the question was put out there was for me to speak up. It also made me feel like I didn't belong, like someone was going to pull me aside and say "you know, thanks for trying, but you really don't have what it takes to do this." And then where would I be?  Sigh. This is the whiniest I think I've been on my blog so far. I'd better stop now before I win the award for most self-pitying.

      So for 2 days in a row I've been wearing pigtails. I don't think I've  ever  worn pigtails in public before. It's very fun, since this way I can wear my stylin' bandana at work, and people can still see my cute curly hair. I'm very proud of my hair--but then I have to shell out a lot of money to get it that curly, so I don't really feel too bad being proud of it.  On a completely different topic, I just saw a commercial for Steak N Shake, for their "side by side milkshakes," where they pour two flavors in one cup, side by--well, I think you get the point. So at first I thought hey, that's pretty cool... until I realized that if I couldn't decide between a chocolate or a banana milkshake, couldn't I just get a chocolate-banana shake? I mean, the place  I  work at would do that. So, why do I need to have them side by side? It's not like you'd be able to keep both sides completely separate...  Or maybe I'm just reading too much into things, and what I really need to do is go take out my pigtails and go to bed.

      Well, it has begun. A whole new store. (Ok so I was in a wedding store today and they were playing "A Whole New World" from Aladdin, so it's in my head.)  Anyway... I like the new store--it's cute. I felt bad though 'cause we didn't do much today except move a few things and talk to the associates for 90 minutes. (and I didn't even do any of the talking... I just sat next to Kat, trying desperately to hear all those kids when they spoke--unfortunately they don't seem to get the concept of projecting so it was nearly impossible.) But of course it's not my fault they didn't pass the fire code or whatever until today.  On the plus side, I got a nice little take-home... we were putting the containers away, and there were two old-style ones that somehow had gotten to the store. And since they don't fit in any of the new containers, it was decided that the old ones would be thrown out. Well... I find it VERY hard to see someone throw out something that's still servicable, so I offered to take them home. They're sitting on my bed right now, and I know Ganino's just wating with bated breath to see what I do with them, but I just wasn't in the mood to figure it out tonight. So I'll probably just leave them on the coffee table for a while, along with the cute frames I got at IKEA. I have to say, it is nice knowing I'm going to be so close to IKEA every day. Although I'm NOT looking forward to driving. But hey, at least I get a rental car. That'll be fun. And that means I'll be in charge of the music. No more Ganino Specials. Who hoo. ;o)

      So I just got an email from a friend of mine and her signiature line was a quote from Harry Potter (the book--although perhaps it was in the movie as well). It was heartening to see such a great quote too...   "It is not our abilities that show what we truly are... it is our choices."--Albus Dumbledore   How true is that? And how cool that Courtney chose to spread that sentiment to all of her friends and family through email? I know that a lot of friends of mine have quotes in their signiature lines, but most of them are from scripture or very old writers/theologians/philosophers. Now, I have nothing at all against any of those, of course, but there's something really cool about seeing wisdom in a modern work--it makes me realize that while it's true that there is nothing new under the sun, there is indeed a new way of looking at everything, and new ways to resonate wisdom in each others' minds and hearts. And of course, that gives me hope for my writing, and its potential. Because while writing is fulfilling in and of itself, I yearn to write of Truth and Wisdom in such a way that my audience would never read anything of mine and come away unchanged.

      Do you ever realize that for someone you're "that neighbor?" You know, the one who plays their music too loud, or the one who you can hear having sex, or the one whose cat is in heat every third day and yowls out the window?  Ok, so I'm pretty darn sure I'm not the second one, and my cat's neutered, so if he yowls it's just because sometimes he hates to be alone, but I have the feeling that he meows at the door only when he can hear me coming down the hall. The first one though... well, I'm nowhere NEAR as bad as MY "neighbor," but I have realized that there is an apartment that wraps around the building so their bedroom window is about 3 feet away from my window... And not only do I have a studio (which means that I don't have a quiet bedroom "buffer zone"), but I'm such a night owl that I always have the TV on, or the radio, or I'm singing along to a CD or something.  And I laugh. Loudly. I think that's probably the biggest problem for whoever it is whose window is so close to mine. I love to laugh, and I'm not shy about it--especially since I live alone, so there's no one sitting next to me to care how loud I'm being. And I'm loud when I talk on the phone too. Shoot, I'm just loud. That's probably my biggest fault, according to my neighbor. I feel kinda bad about it, but then I think... well, until they complain, I'm not going to worry about it. So I'm content being that first neighbor. But man... wait till I'm hitched and I probably WILL be the second neighbor.  One can only hope.

      For some reason my mom can talk me into watching the dog for them. Why, oh why, do I let myself get talked into shlepping myself out to the 'burbs to sit for a dog I really don't like while my family does something fun that I wasn't invited to? Sigh.  It's not that I totally hate the dog. It's just that he was never fully trained, and if he picks up something (like, say, a squished chipmunk) while we're on his walk, there is NO way I can get it away from him without a huge fight. And the dog usually wins the fight, because... well, he's got very sharp teeth! So today when I couldn't keep him from bringing in the squished chipmunk, I had to deal with all the fun and joy of trying to just get him tied to the door so he wouldn't snap at me so I could go upstairs and leave him alone with his stupid freakin' squished chipmunk.  Fortunately after about a half hour (filled with me telling my friend Megen all about the joys of dealing with a dog that's just found a squished chipmunk) I was able to knock the squished chipmunk down the stairs with two empty wrapping paper tubes pushed together (if I got any closer the dog would growl at me) and I was then, after another half hour, able to walk past the dog, throw out the squished chipmunk, and deal with the dog. I think the fact that he had no water helped--I'm sure he realized that the joy of having a squished chipmunk would pale considerably when weighed against the prospect of going for 24 hours without water (which I had told him I was perfectly comfortable doing, since I knew he wouldn't die from it that fast).  Can you tell I'm a bit PO'd right now? I really wish the dog didn't have his Alpha Male tendancies, because he'd be a great big huge fun dog. But nooo... we have to end up with the psycho dog. Sigh. At least I don't have to deal with him every day. But did I ever mention how I like cats soo much more? Not that I have anything against a FULLY trained dog. (Well, even then I love that my cat doesn't need to be walked 4 times a day.)  But fortunately the dog settled down, and I gave him some water, and it was very easy to put him to bed--I think he might have picked up on my extreme feelings against his behavior. So that's good. Maybe next time he'll think twice before picking up the squished chipmunk.

      I got a new cell phone today! I'm so very excited. I was still using the free phone I got 3 years ago--a phone which caused the woman helping me to laugh.... Anyway, I'm so happy 'cause I got another free phone (well, you know one of those "it's $179 but we'll take $100 off and there's a $79 rebate!" phones) but it's a CAMERA phone! I can't describe the joy. I've been so upset that I don't have a digital camera, and while this isn't exactly a full replacement, at least it's something! And it's got a calendar and voice recognition, and while it's probably nothing compared to Ganino's Amazing Calculator, I'm pretty darn happy. :o)

      If someone had asked me earlier today if I ever expected to meet my alderman, and under what conditions that would be, I certainly would never have replied "I expect to meet him while half-sitting, half-lying on the sidewalk, having just tripped over a woodchip."  But oh, how right I would have been. But let me start from the beginning.  I was on my way to see Kill Bill 2 at the Vic Brew & View, which is just about 3 blocks from my apartment. I was running late, having spent a little too much time making myself cute, and I'd thrown on my black sandals (because they were the only ones that matched my black-and-gray attire... and of course it always helps to dress dark for a late-night movie on a weeknight). Now, I knew going into it that I have weak ankles, and that these sandals aren't the best for walking fast. I also knew that the first block and a half of my walk was in a less-than-brightly-lit part of the neighborhood. Pushing aside my common sense for the sake of time, however, I was walking briskly down the sidewalk when a woodchip that certainly had  no  place in the middle of the sidewalk suddenly turned my ankle, and down I went.  Well, at least no one was around to see me, I thought, a second before I heard someone jogging toward me, asking if I was OK.   Aw, man....  And all of a sudden I was face-to-face with Tom Tunney. But he was just too adorable--he was sooo concerned, which completely makes sense now, especially since he told me that they'd just redone all the sidewalks (which of course was supposed to make them safer to walk on). But hey, far be it for me to follow the norms of safety, right? Then he asked me where I was going, and offered me a ride. "I'm your alderman," he said, "Can I drive you somewhere?"  You know, I don't normally accept rides from strangers, but I don't think anyone would ever use "I'm your alderman" as a pick-up line, so I accepted the ride. We had a nice chat about people who don't trust other people for the two blocks he drove me, and he dropped me off with the admonishment not to trip again. (I didn't, thank God.)  So I can now say that I have met my alderman, and that he was a pretty cool guy. He's certainly going to get my vote, and probably a thank-you note as well. As for the woodchip, I found it on my way home, and... well, let's just say that it's not so mighty no more.

      I'm so excited... my cat is finally back home! It was so nice to go to my parents and pick him up. I feel bad though, because I don't think he really wanted to leave. Of course there's the fact that the parents have a LOT more room, and I believe they feed him more, but also I think that the dog and cat have finally become something close to friends. If nothing else, I'm sure it's been great for the cat to know that there's always another animal in the house, even if the dog wasn't allowed to have the run of the house.  It was so cute when we got out the cat carrier though... not only did my cat run away to hide, but the dog started barking at us, and I just know he was telling us that he didn't want the cat to have to leave. For all that they seemed to hate each other last time, they sure seem to be friends now. Of course, that still didn't stop me from taking the cat back... he  is  mine, after all. :o)
