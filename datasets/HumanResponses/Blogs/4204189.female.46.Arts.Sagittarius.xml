						    well-it is the summertime...who said it had to be sunny.      monsoon conditions  out there in the garden and the cats..o yes-the cats-8 of 'em..you'll meet them soon enough..are all sat at the open window(the one with the mesh on so they cant get out but they can get air)jostling for the best position.......   *sigh*   mind you-i'd rather have it raining and cool..than baking hot.   no pleasing some people is there?   and the reason you're reading this drivel?   i dunno-but the reason i'm writing it...and i can't guarantee i'll keep it up..is i have 2 friends in america-i havent met them in person so they could be serial killers with computer privelidges for all i know....but they've started blogs and the only way i could make idiotic comments on their blogs was to start one myself.   other wise i could've stayed anonymous and demanded money.   anyway-friday-off to the shop..i'm trying to get people into my paintings which is hard cos i don't really like people.....so i suppose its like eating your greens-something ya have to do.      o-and i don't do capital letters whe n i type.      i'm not too good and punctuation either.....   so sue me.
