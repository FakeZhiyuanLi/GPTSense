      It's been a while since my last post & now I even have a new Blog.  What happened was this: outside forces beyond my control caused me to delete my old Blog, but now I am back again...hopefully I won't have to delete this one too...  Well a lot has happened since my last post, I wish I could remember exactly when I delted my old one, oh well i guess...anyway, let's see, what all has happened?  Celebrated 6 Months Tuesday (June 22nd) & it was such a great night to say the least, it was amazing...i really am happier than I have ever beem  Also on Tuesday I FINALLY got my license...it has been a long time coming...I turned 16 in January & I got my permit on February 14, 2003, so it was well over a year before I got my license...now I jsut have to learn Standard so I can start driving my Jeep...I think sometime I might take some pictures of it & post them on here...  The week before I took Driver's Ed with Ault's School of Driving...it wasn't actually that bad...I think part of it was though, that my instructor was really cool...she took us all over - North Port, Venice/Venice Beach, Englewood, etc....we even drove to the bank one day so she could cash a check...hahaha  I finally got a cell phone too, so that is kinda cool...  I've been doing a lot of swimming over the summer too...the good thing is that I have only really been doing mornings (onc practice a day) so I actually got some time to relax this summer...  I've been working with my dad too this summer, a lot more than usual I think & it is kinda hard, but it's not too bad...  Also, I'm tutoring this elementary school kid, so that is something new...  My Internet Explorer was having problems due to Pop-Ups & Spyware, so thanks to David, I downloaded Mozilla & I haven't had any problems since...I do need to figure out if there is a way to hear sound or not...  Been messing around on www.ytmnd.com (You The Man Now Dog)...it is kinda lame, but whatever...some of them are really funny I guess...  Let's see, what else is there to say?  I got some new CDs...ummmmmmmm:  Mario Winans - Hurt No More ,  Masta Killa - No Said Date , & Beastie Boys - To The 5 Boroughs .  I'm still waiting for Cam'Ron to release  Purple Haze  (I think I'll post a picture of that after I'm done with this post)  Saw  Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story  the other day & I really enjoyed it...it was probably one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while...iot was simply put: Hilarious...I suggest that everyone sees it...  Not much else to report I guess...I got a pair of glasses so when I'm lazy I won't have to put my contacts in...been doing some summer work for my AP Classes...read  The Secret History  & it was suprisngly a very good book...i really enjoyed reading it...

           I am actually keeping up with posts on My Blog now.     My Website is looking good and being updated fairly often.     The CHS Forum is up and running thanks to Aaron and Sarah.     Campagined door-to-door in Enlewood today with Ashley and Victor.     Need help for Saturday August 7, 2004.  For times ask me.     My AP Language work is almost done.     AP Chemistry work will begin tomorrow and be done  almost literally nonstop.     School starts in about a week.

        Here are some songs that I think disprove the Rap-Stereotype of ' Sex, Drugs, & Violence ' &amp; have more meaning to them than most songs in the same genre.

      It has once again been a while since my last post. Since then, it has come to my attention that Blogger now has more features (colors, fonts, centering, & easier image options) so that is a great way to start on a new foot, because now I think I'm  really  going to post more frequently.      But yes, I do have lots to say. Where to start? Yesterday I got home from the Florida Southern Sectionals Meet, a 5-Day Meet in Fort Lauderdale. I swam each day: Wednesday - 200m Freestyle Relay; Thursday - 100m Freestyle, 200m Backstroke, & 400m Freestyle Relay; Friday - 200m Freestyle; Saturday - 100m Backstroke & 200m Medley Relay; Sunday - 50m Freestyle & 400m Medley Relay. I went Personal Best times in almost all of my events &amp; I think I'm getting back into the swing of things as far as that goes. The Relays did especially well. On the 200m Free Relay I went 2nd, on the 400m Free Relay I went 4th (Anchored), on the 200m Medley Relay I went 1st (Backstroke), & on the 400m Medley Relay I went 1st (Backstroke). It wasn't the greatest meet I have ever had, but it was, as I said before, a good starting point.     While in Fort Lauderdale, I went to the mall for some back-to-school shopping &amp; found some stuff: shirts, shorts, & now I finally have a new pair of tennis shoes. I also went to this music store &amp; to my delight I found a CD I haven't been able to find for years:  M.O.P - To The Death . It is their first ever album & was released in 1994 on some unknown label, so it never really made a big impact &amp; is kind of hard to find, but I finally have it. So I can scratch one off of the 'Stuff I Need To Buy' list. It really is a great CD though, as a matter of fact, I'm listening to it right now. While I was at the mall, I also bought a new Buddha. He's painted with different vibrant colors & I was glad I found him.     One of the days I was there I had a terrible headache, &amp; seeing as how I get headaches quite frequently we had scheduled an appointment with a Neurologist a while back, which just happens to be today.       I have recently started a Fantasy Football League through Yahoo!  The League name is ' Johnson Is The Key To Success ' & there will be a LIVE Online draft sometime in September, so if anyone wants to join contact me for more information.        urlLink My Website  is going well. I need to update it some more, but so far, so good. I'm liking the direction it's going: not too complicated or anything, but just a nice place to look around on if you are bored. Has information on Swimming, Music, Movies, etc. so if you have the time, check it out.     Tomorrow is the Tarpon Leadership Academy thing at Charlotte High School, which means school is near. It will only be a few weeks until I am back in school &amp; back to the books. Well that's not exactly true, because I have had my share of Advanced Placement Summer Work, which I am happy to say is actually going well. I still have to finish a book & some Chemistry work, but I really think this year is going to be different as far as my study &amp; work habits go.     Learning Standard with my Jeep is going well & I should be driving it by myself in no time. I think when I have a little free time I will take some pictures of it &amp; post them either here or on  urlLink My Website's Photo Album .      My Dad's Campaign for Charlotte County Commissioner of District 1 is going well. We recently put Campaign Signs up & are still going door-to-door. If anyone is interested in helping, we really need it &amp; appreciate anything you can do. For more information you can visit  urlLink My Dad's Campaign Website .  If you are interested in helping out please let me know by one of the following:          Instant Message Me (AOL Or Yahoo!)     E-Mail     Leave A Comment Here     Call Me (House Or Cell)    I learned that Ricky Williams, formerly of the Miami Dolphins, has retired. My friend Howard told me today that it was only Williams' 5th Year in the NFL & that in order to receive a pension, you must play for 5 years. Does anyone else see a coincidence here? I think that's pretty cheap of him. He is one of the Best Running Backs in the League and he just retires after 5 years. Oh well, I wasn't a big fan of him &amp; I have never liked the Dolphins either, so most certainly will not lose sleep over this.     That's all I have to say for now, but I will do my best to keep up with Posting from now on.

      There are only four days left until school begins and this year will hopefully be a lot different from the previous year.  The AP Work is going well and I should be done this weekend.  As I said, this year should be a lot different from  previous years, for several reasons.  One being the workload.  Taking six College Level Courses will undoubtedly leave me with a lot of work to be done, but I am up for the challenge.  I also hope to be a lot more involved this year.  Currently, I am involved in National Honor Society, Tarpon Leadership Academy, Interact Club, Forum/Mock Trial Club, A-Team, and Math Club.  I hope to join several more clubs and be involved a lot more this year.  An issue that has come up with some Advanced Placement and Dual Enrollment Sutdents concerning the weight of these demanding classes.  As it stands now, Charlotte County Schools have Honors Classes as the weight as AP/DC classes.  Many people disagree with this: students, parents, teachers, and even faculty.  The bottom line is that these courses [AP/DC] are more demanding than others [Honors], therefore they should be weighted higher.  As it stands now, people in the upper portion of class rank may be there only because they are getting A's in Honors Classes, whereas students in AP/DC classes received a B.  In order for there to be a chance at changing ths unfair weight system we need help.  I started an  online  petition and it went fairly well.  We had around 70-something signatures and I hope to start a  real  petition this year and get a lot of support.  If you have any questions or wish to help, let me know.  When school starts I'm not sure how often I will post.  It will probably end up being a schedule of posts on the weekends becuase school will consume most of my free time during the week.  That will probably also be the case with My Website.  Aaron and Sarah started a CHS Forum and it is undergoing some updates and whatnot presently, but should be up soon.  The link can be found on My Website.  Also created was  CHS Community on LiveJournal.  Ginny started this and I suggest you check it out.  The link for this is also on My Website.  That's all for now.  I'm sure I will make a few more posts before school begins.

      I'm not sure when, but the other day I was walking around SamGoody and because I had some time to spare and I came upon a CD I hadn't seen. It was  Take 'Em To The Cleaners  by  Consequence .  You may have heard him on  Kanye West's   Spaceship  from the album  The College Dropout . He kind of disappeared, but now he is making a comeback and I think he will be bigger than before. This Album is actually a Mixtape and Kanye West hosts it. The tracklist and a Cover Image can be found on the Music section of My Website. It's a great Album/Mixtape and I suggest you check it out.  The Diplomats have released a new Mixtape this week from  Jim Jones ,  Ambitionz Of A Gangsta .   This release means one thing:  The Diplomats Present...Jim Jones - On My Way To Church  is coming to stoors soon. The date Jimmy's Album will hit the shelves is August 24, 2004. His newly released Mixtape can be seen on the DipSet Mixtapes section on My Website with a link to MixUnit.com for Tracklisting and more info. I can't wait to order the Mixtape and drive down to Circuit City to purchase this highly anticipated Debut Album.  While  Jim Jones  has a set date for  On My Way To Church ,  Cam'Ron  still hasn't released his forthcoming Album  Purple Haze .  What really makes me mad is that it was  supposed  to be released December 16, 2003 but is continually getting pushed back to a later date. Now it has been said it will drop this Summer, but i don't see that happening. Instead I see it coming,  IF  we are lucky, this Fall.  If you haven't heard already, Harlem Rapper and Bad Boy Recording Artist  Ma$e  is back in the Music Business.  His forthcoming Album,  Welcome Back , is set to be released alongside fellow Harlem Native  Jimmy Jones .  Ironically, there is somewhat of a 'Beef' between the two rappers.  Rapper  N.O.R.E.  a.k.a.  Noreaga  from the Hip Hop Duo  Capone-N-Noreaga  ( C.N.N. ) has just signed with  Roc-A-Fella Records .   DJ Smallz  has just put out the 3rd installment in his  Welcome To...  Series with  Welceom To New Orleans .  I hope to build a  DJ Smallz Mixtapes  page on My Website before school starts back up.  I hope to get the new  D-12  Album,  World  before this weekend.  While I didn't care too much for the lead single,  My Band , I really like the song  How Come .  From what I have heard, the album is worth my money.  That's all for now.

      Hello.  As I said before this will be the first post in a set of four.  Life is going great and I have nothing to really complain about. This is the final week of Summer and I am trying to make the most of it while still managing and completing my schoolwork.  Yesterday I went to school to get a parking permit and when I start driving to school I am guranteed a spot. I've been taking the Jeep out pretty regularly this week and soon I should be able to drive more and farther. I will try to post some pictures of the Jeep either here or on the website.  One thing that has really made this week enjoyable is that I have had no swim practice. A week off is just what I had hoped for and I finally got it. When school starts back though, that means practice will resume it's spot in the later portion of my day.  Today is the fourth, as I'm sure you know, but it seemed as if it were only yesterday I was thinking to myself, "Wow, it's been 7 months." 8 months is approaching soon and I truly am happier than I have been.  Thank  You .  Last Saturday went great for my dad's campaign. We went door-to-door in Englewood and hopefully we can get enough people together to finish up Englewood this Saturday. If you aren't busy and would like to help us out, get in contact with me for information.  Not much else to report. This final week of Summer has been for me, what most people have the entire 2 Months: Staying up late, sleeping in, and basically doing whatever you want.  My Website is going great and if anyone can help me with either of these problems I would greatly appreciate the help:      Does anyone know how to make links so when you click the link a song/sound will be played?     Does anyone know how to make a link so when you click the link it opens up an AIM or Yahoo! Messenger Chat Window?    If you know how to do either of the above or know someone that does or a place where I can find information I would be much obilged. Thank You.
