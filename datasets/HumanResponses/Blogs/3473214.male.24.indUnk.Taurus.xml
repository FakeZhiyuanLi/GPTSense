      Good question! I don't know how to put it in good order or explanation. I'm an ordinary  gay  guy who likes spending time in front of the internet and computer (yes, you're right, Internet junkie. No, I'm not a geek or nerd).&nbsp; Oh btw,  urlLink this is my entire blog, will&nbsp;take you into another new page.    I have an obsession of possesing books, mainly about  porns  science, politics, firearms.&nbsp;My biggest addiction is&nbsp; urlLink Ultima Online  (you can read more about it at  urlLink UO Stratics ). Also there is a hidden obsession in me about poems and poetries. I've been writing and collecting them since I was very young. My fave pet is dogs even I haven't got any change to have any for my own. And recently (for the past one year and more, I love to eat. I mean eat really a lot). I'm a big fan of Japanese Cuisines. I also like loneliness, science, freedom and Manchester United.   My fave sports are basketball (even haven't played it for years), riding bicycle, chess and mahjong. And some other cards games but I don't like gambling.   Light blue, black, white, gray are my fave colors.   Winter or summer? Winter.   Beach, lake or mountain? Lake and mountain.   Music that can blows me away is slow musics, like  urlLink Jim Reeves &nbsp;(ask your mum and dad), Elvis Presley (if you don't know him, I should send you back to the stone age), Billie Holiday, Janis Joplin, Natalie Merchant,&nbsp; urlLink Norah Jones ,  urlLink Eric Clapton ,  urlLink Dido ,  urlLink Enya ,  urlLink R.E.M. ,  urlLink Dewa 19  (an Indonesian band).   TV shows I enjoy the most mostly are comedies such as  urlLink Everybody Loves Raymond ,  urlLink Becker ,  urlLink Friends . And some other drama series like  urlLink CSI ,  urlLink The Agency ,  urlLink 24 . Also some other sci-fi movies like Star Wars, Babylon 5, Star Trek, SG-1.  Movies? Oh, I'm a movies lover. My fave movies are military theme, science and science fiction, medieval age, political movies and of course comedy-action movies (especially with Jackie Chan in it!) I'm a big fan of  urlLink Tom Hanks ,  urlLink Sean Connery ,  urlLink John Travolta ,  urlLink Pierce Brosnan .   Actress? Oh don't worry my fave actress lis is even longer.  urlLink Sandra Bullock  is one of my fave, cute, talented and sexy   I found  urlLink Jodie Foster  has a sexy sound when she talks.  urlLink Kate Bosworth ,  urlLink Julianne Moore ,  urlLink Julia Roberts ,  urlLink Kelly Hu ,  urlLink Kristin Kreuk ,  urlLink Kate Beckinsale ,  urlLink Jessica Biel ,  urlLink Jennifer Connelly  (she has sexy eyes!),  urlLink Tiffany Amber Thiessen . Do you think I should stop now? Ok, one more, I promise,  urlLink Angelina Jolie ,  urlLink Ashley Judd ,  urlLink Diane Lane ,  urlLink Famke Janssen ,  urlLink Charlize Theron . See what I mean? The list is still on, about another hundred names     I like them based on their performances in the movies. Either it's physical attraction or the quality of acting. Anyway, I like them all equally.   Oh, I enjoy watching reality shows too, such as  urlLink Survivor ,  urlLink The Apprentice.  For talk shows, my choice goes to  urlLink Late Show with David Letterman , and  urlLink Oprah.    People will find me easy going but I don't like any misbehaviour like impolite or rude. It happens a lot when I took my first impression of someone to be taken into the rest of the relationship (wtf?!) hehehe.. I'm careless person who spend half of my time in clumsiness (doh!), but indeed I'm unique, a bit extrovert. Strange and lazy. I'm a thinker but you will only find it in some few occassions (hahaha...) Funny. Witty. Sometimes complicated. Freaking moody and can get cranky sometimes (please note the word "sometimes")  &nbsp;  So, this hopefully will describe myself briefly. You can read  urlLink my blog here . Thank you!

      Well, I'm kinda stumble around to choose my blog name. At first I thought I'll put the blog at this one. Why? Because that's my nick "Lelet"; comes from Hamlet. But people sometimes just call me Lelet. In my language it means "slow to react" which is kinda representing me  at some moment     So I think it's better for me to 'book' this blog. Then I'll put a link to  urlLink my original blog.   But I'm open to suggestions, if you think you can help me name my blog, feel free to leave in as comment. Anyway, thanks for passing by!

						    English Version:   There are 5 houses, each has different colors than the others. Each house will be owned by one man with different nationalities. Each man likes one particular type of drink, smoking different cigarette brand and have different pet than the others. NO ONE of those five men has same drink type, same cigarette brand, or having same pet than the others.   The question is: Who has the fish?  The hints:  · The British lives in the Red house · The Swedish owns a dog · The Danish likes to drink tea · The Green house is lied exactly on the left of the White house · The owner of the Green house likes to drink coffee · The man who smokes Pall Mall owns a bird · The man who lives in the house exactly at the middle loves to drink milk · The man in the Yellow house smokes Dunhill · The Norwegian lives in the first house · The man smokes Marlboro lives next to the man who has a cat · The man who has the horse, lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill · The man who smokes Winfield likes to drink beer · Next to the Blue house, the Norwegian  · The Germany man smokes Rothmans  · The man who smokes Marlboro, is neighbour with the man who likes to drink water  Now, the kicking is, this was made by Einstein. He said that only about 2% of the world population (maybe at his time) that could only solve this, the rest 98% might too dumb... (or just don't give a crap LOL)  Have fun!!   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Indonesian Version:   Ada 5 buah rumah yang masing-masing memiliki warna yang berbeda. Setiap rumah dihuni satu orang pria dengan kebangsaan yang berbeda-beda. Setiap penghuni menyukai satu jenis minuman tertentu, merokok satu merk rokok tertentu dan memelihara satu jenis hewan tertentu. Tidak ada satupun dari kelima orang tersebut yang minum minuman yang sama, merokok merk rokok yang sama dan memelihara hewan yang sama seperti penghuni yang lain.   Pertanyaannya : SIAPAKAH YANG MEMELIHARA IKAN ?   Petunjuk :   · Orang Inggris tinggal di rumah yang berwarna merah  · Orang Swedia memelihara anjing  · Orang Denmark senang minum teh  · Rumah berwarna hijau terletak tepat di sebelah kiri rumah berwarna putih  · Penghuni rumah berwarna hijau senang minum kopi  · Orang yang merokok Pall Mall memelihara burung  · Penghuni rumah yang ditengah-tengah senang minum susu  · Penghuni rumah yang berwarna kuning merokok Dunhill  · Orang Norwegia tinggal di rumah yang paling pertama  · Orang yang merokok Marlboro tinggal di sebelah orang yang memelihara kucing  · Orang yang memelihara kuda tinggal disebelah orang yang merokok Dunhill  · Orang yang merokok Winfield senang minum bir  · Disebelah rumah berwarna biru tinggal orang Norwegia  · Orang Jerman merokok Rothmans  · Orang yang merokok Marlboro bertetangga dengan orang yang minum air
