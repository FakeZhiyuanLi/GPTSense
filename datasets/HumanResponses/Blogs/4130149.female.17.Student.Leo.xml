       Well, well. It's the day after my b-day and I'm bored as hell. Oh, but at least I won't be tomorrow.  (growls) Because tomorrow, *lucky* me, I have to "help" clear out all the shit in the halls and in mom's room so they can set up the CPack so my mom can breathe easier. Of course, said help will most likely involve my dad yelling at me not to do this and that. Meanwhile, the house is a mess because of all the crap he bought at garage sales that he won't sell. How on earth am I expected to clear out the halls (with all the newspapers and magazines on the floor) and mom's room in a few hours, much less a few days?  Meanwhile, in other news, Mom will be getting a handicapped placard because she can't walk more than a few feet without getting badly out of breath. This is a change because the doctors wouldn't give it to her before- I guess the prescription of oxygen and the CPack changed their minds...  (sighs) Anyway, The Other Saga is very stilted. I think it may be because I prefer the spinoff what with its limitless creativity. I can create a universe in one chapter and it may be completely different than the one before it or after it. The Other Saga can't compare, besides, it sort of annoys me somehow that Cosmo and Wanda are separate and I have three storylines going on at once (yes, I know that's my fault!).  Watched "Family Guy" on DVD today (no cable makes soulful_sin go something something)- an ep called "Death Lives" that supports my one-shot. Death says that Peter will die two years after Lois leaves him unless he pays more attention to her. Knowing Peter, that lesson won't stick *at all* and Death was probably right.  Rebecca-chan is going to college soon and I'll miss her. Even though her family will let me record off her set (score!), she's such a good friend to me. She's even threatened to call a rabbi (I'm Jewish) to go postal on my father. Not to mention she gave her prom dress and jewelry for my b-day! Isn't she the sweetest?  Tammy-chan, my other friend who will be *entering* Parsippany High School as a frosh this upcoming year, is being held prisoner in her house by her evil parents. That I feel bad for her for, because she's responsible for her younger brother who was in a car accident due to her mother's negligence (she plowed into a tree). He can barely talk and is wheelchair bound, needing her care nearly twenty-four seven (and he's spoiled to boot).  However, she's the one stuck in the house recording my shows for me and she *still* manages to miss 70% of them. That's because she's selfish and doesn't like certain shows (like Lizzie McGuire, Jimmy Neutron, and Fairly Oddparents, a.k.a, my favorite shows). All she does is sit and watch anime, anime *I* helped her get, by the way. If she's that free with her time, why can't she record my shows? Tis a mystery...  Ah, I feel I have to mention this before I close- I love my boyfriend, Patrick, whom I still have yet to meet but will soon, hopefully. We both share horrible lives and The Other Saga (well, it's still *my* story, but he loves it so much he knows it better than I do), and, of course, our love. So sweet, isn't it? Stop staring at the screen!       At any rate, I'm done for the evening. Have fun, you guys, but nothing R rated. Because you know, I'm barely legal for that. (wink, wink)
