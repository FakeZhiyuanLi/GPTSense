						          urlLink why does laura hate  you ?   urlLink mewing.net           urlLink take the "are you a democrat or a republican?" test.     urlLink  and go to mewing.net to love or sass.     Surprise, surprise, eh?  So,  Paul  decided to post a comment, did he? A few of my other friends from the Barrow Downs appear to have accounts on here. I can at least have them to talk to, assuming they have their blogs public.  Oh, so in changing an ink cartridge, "Open Here" on the wrapping is definitely a blatant lie. It's like in Ellen DeGeneres's stand-up, when she said, "'Open Here'? Is that sarcasm? Are you mocking me? 'Open Here'!" I just end up ripping one side. At least I have pretty black ink in the black ink cartridge again. Hopefully I won't have to deal with my printer for a good while. It gets fussy, yells at me, then refuses to print anything except for what appear to be Wingding symbols. I really need a new computer, but my dad's waiting for me to go to college. He's going to get me a laptop and a printer to bring with me. Then my mom will be on her own to deal with this computer. I swear, as they get older computers develop more and more of a personality. Mine always had a fair amount, but even more so now.  Well, time for some more dancing in the fields. Namaste.

						               urlLink what's  your  battle cry?  |   urlLink mewing.net  |  urlLink  merchandise!     Really? Not "Forth Eorlingas"? Ah, well, can't have everything.  I e-mailed my friend. I hope he found a house. He was staying at his friend's for a while, but he was going to have to leave.  I should probably also e-mail my prom date. I hope he got back from my friend's okay. My friend's brother and his friends were hilarious. It's the perfect anti-drug ad, really. I've never gotten stoned, and I really have no desire to do so. I've seen what they do to my friends, and I just don't want to have to deal with all of that for a high that can't even be that great, in my opinion. Just give me a driving musical beat to release the chemicals in my brain, and I'm cool.  I must go, now. Feel free to play with the hummingbird. Namaste.

						     You are going to Marry Josh Hartnett. He is really shy, but don't let that fool you. He is really outgoing and sweet with those he loves and will be loyal to them for the rest of his life. Congrats!!    urlLink   Which male celebrity are you going to marry? (14 choices now!!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    GaladrieloftheOlden commented. I feel all warm and special inside. Hmmm...I get Josh Hartnett a lot on these quizzes. I don't particularly like him, though. He seems like a nice enough kid, I suppose.  I saw Daniel Radcliffe on Regis and Kelly. He's actually rather fine. He's only almost fifteen, though. The clip of him with a Hippogriff wasn't bad...good effects. A lot of people commented both that the new movie was darker and had better effects. Darker is always better with movies, in my opinion. I'm not a huge "giggly movie" fan. I just get bored with them. I'm also not a huge fan of wrapping everything up in a nice neat package at the end. I really hope David Chase doesn't do that next week with the finale of the Sopranos. I think Carmella and/or Christopher and/or Finn are going to die. I know Tony B's gone, unless he usurps Tony somehow. I can't see them actually killing off Tony S, though.  Well, just commenting on how much I appreciate GaladrieloftheOlden's comment. Namaste.

						    urlLink     Happy Memorial Day Weekend!  I started the second piece for my Advanced Studio Art final. It's not very original, but I like it. The problem is that we only have about two weeks to do them. Since we have so much other schoolwork preparing for finals, we can't really do a flashy, original work that would typically take about a month. My list of ideas for concentrations just keeps growing longer and longer. I really want to do moving water or horse anatomy, though. My worry is that I will not be close to them enough to really do anything. I'm at my barn a lot, but who really wants to sit there and draw horses when you can ride them?  I still haven't had any word from my "homeless" friend. I should e-mail him again, probably. I wonder if he straightened things out with his parents. If he didn't live in Washington States, I'd tell him he can crash with me. Of course my parents probably wouldn't really go for that much.  Note to self: probably shouldn't tell people about this blog. I kind of want to be free to be myself here, and not have to worry that a friend (or my father, who blogs on this site too) will come to me the next day and say, "You horrible creature! Erase your posts!" Chances are my dad will stumble upon it. However, I doubt that he would randomly come up with the fact that my name on here is Empyreal Faerie. Knowing my other names on various other sites, it makes sense. For a change my name isn't in Elvish. That's a step up I suppose. Empyreal is a great word.  So I was thinking of doing a quiz or two a day. Start off with a fun quiz, then get into my mundane life. You'd think I could manage to be happy with such a normal life, but no: I have to be one of those people with teenage angst. I actually hate it. A lot of teens embrace the hormones and become goth or emo. Emo people are starting to get annoying...especially since they all relate to Donnie Darko when their lives are nowhere near the same. I'm actually one of the rare non-Emo people that love Donnie Darko. I became a fan far before this whole "I'm depressed but not goth: I'm  emo , which means I have  emotions ." Not that some of my better friends aren't emo...they just get on my nerves after a while. I feel like saying, "You live in a great neighborhood, you go to the same prep school I do, you get good grades, you're one of the preppiest people I know, so stop whining and enjoy this life."  "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" comes out June Fourth. Hopefully Alfonso Cuarón will be as good a director as I think he is. "Y Tu Mamá También" was a good movie. Anyway, couldn't be much worse than Chris Columbus, I suppose. No offense to the man, but Cuarón's Hogwarts seems better so far. Still not entirely sure about Gary Oldman as Sirius Black and David Thewlis as Remus Lupin. Although, if Gary Oldman can play Drexl Spivey, I'm sure he can pull of Sirius Black. I'd hate to admit it, but I do find Oldman rather attractive, which is one of the definite necessities for Black.  "Something The Lord Made" premiered last night, speaking of actors I really shouldn't find attractive, but do. Alan Rickman's in Harry Potter too...although everyone's in this new Harry Potter, from what I hear. I just skipped over to imdb.com, and read some reviews. Nine said "Woohoo! Go Harry!" and two were disappointed. I suppose I'll just have to see for myself.  And, just like every other loser, I obviously have a "Harry Potter"-type fanfic going on. The thing is, I hate reading fanfics. I love writing them, but I hate reading them. That's the main reason why I don't post any of mine anywhere.  I do write my own original stories, though. My problem is that I'm one of those annoying people that has to include every detail about everything ever. I'm afraid that the reader won't live the story as I do while I'm writing it.  Here, I made a dandelion chain for whoever's reading this. I'll talk to you all later. Namaste.

						   If only the post could match up to the anticipation, huh?  Allow me to introduce myself. I the Empyreal Faerie, known by many other names throughout the Web World. I will tell you a little more about myself than the profile tells you.   Favorite actors (based on talent): Alan Rickman, Colin Farrell, Parminder Nagra, Charlize Theron, Christopher Walken, Kate Winslet, Jeremy Davies, Ian McKellen, Lucy Liu, Uma Thurman  Favorite actors (based on appearance): Johnny Depp, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Colin Farrell, Johathan Rhys-Meyers, Brad Pitt, Renée Zellweger, Lucy Liu, Uma Thurman  Favorite TV shows: The Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Deadwood, Curb Your Enthusiasm, The L Word, Dead Like Me  Favorite color: blue, green, or purple  What Harry Potter House would I be in: Slytherin, definitely (you would be surprised how telling House Sorting can be)  What do I want to be when I grow up: I am actually thinking about foreign relations or international affairs or something  And we push onwards to dreaming...   "Imaginary" by Evanescence I linger in the doorway Of alarm clock screaming Monsters calling my name Let me stay Where the wind will whisper to me Where the raindrops As they’re falling tell a story  In my field of paper flowers And candy clouds of lullaby I lie inside myself for hours And watch my purple sky fly over me  Don’t say I’m out of touch With this rampant chaos- your reality I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge The nightmare I built my own world to escape  In my field of paper flowers And candy clouds of lullaby I lie inside myself for hours And watch my purple sky fly over me   Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming The goddess of imaginary light   And now that we actually have good poetry, time for me to paste some old ramblings I found in my computer Notebook diary:  I looked up at a star tonight,  And for a moment we were one. Now I conceive a child of the star, But it will be a pitch black, For how can anything born of such tears Have any hue but black? It was born out of the void, Into this world of nothingness. But it will overcome itself And show the world what it can do. But I realize that I am the child. Born of the void to the world of nothing. And I wonder: What will become of me When my mother, Me, myself, Dies? All that will be left is me The tiny little black void Born of a star and a tear And my mother, Me, myself, Who will have died.  Shall I live on in honor of her, my, memory? Who shall be my mother? What shall I do for my mother's, my, funeral? I shall make music and dance, for I will have died. But still, I am still alive. I will give birth to myself, so I will live on forever In all my creations, I will be present. No matter how hard they try, they will never rid themselves of the void I will have concocted. My void will fill the earth. They will speak of it for millenia. That void, my void, will bring about Everything.  I must go now, though. Dinner is ready. Until another day, friends. Namaste.

						   So my dad and I were lamenting the loss of old Yankees today. We were discussing the Old Guard, with players like Tino Martinez (remember when he hit the Grand Slam and spent the whole rest of the inning jabbering on the bench and illustrating his hit with his arms like a mad man?), Chad Curtis (who used to throw the ball into the infield so hard that his small 5'8" self would flip over), Paul O'Neill (used to break bats and water coolers; his wife used to call him Mr. Happy), Brosius (who looked around like a bird), Chuckie (every throw to first was an adventure), and all those other guys. And there was also the time when Chuck and Shane came to the stadium from the barber shop. Knoblauch had his typical blonde tips and Spenser...had a whole head of platinum blonde hair. It was obvious that Chuck had tipped them to make it lighter or something. Ah, the ragging of the rookie. Anyway, now it's all about the stars: A-Rod, Lofton, Sheffield (whose fans wear chef's hats...how original), etc. I mean we have some of the older guys, like Derek (turned the big three-oh), Bernie, Jorge, Mo, and the like, but all the old spirit is gone.  And you know what? I even miss Al Trautwig, the old nerdy announcer that always tried to be cool and to play with the big boys. I mean today Michael Kay said, "And now we come to the three headed monster Quangormo! That's Quantrill, Gordon, and Mariano Rivera!" I mean who says that? If someone didn't have a really, really firm grip of the English language, I guarantee that they wouldn't understand half of what they say. "Giving chase is Matsui" - lovely syntax there. "Along with Jim Kaat, I'm Michael Kay" - are you both at once?  Wimbledon's on too. My dad always plays devil's advocate and pulls for the opposite of who I want: I wanted Henman, he wanted Arazi; I preferred Roddick, so he wanted Dent. Although Dent's a pretty cool guy: looks a lot like Pudge Rodriguez.  Speaking of, I think it would be brilliant if we got Nomar Garciaparra to play second for us next year. I'd love to see the look on Boston's collective face if that happened. Then we'd have Posada catching, Giambi on first, Garciaparra on second, A-Rod at third, Jeter at short, then a choice of Sierra, Lofton, Sheffield, Williams, and Matsui in the outfield. Nomar seems like a good guy too: his spirit might work with us. Even though we still go for big bucks so much (nice to see that George really does love us), the connection is still what makes us. There are some pretty goot players that just can't handle being a Yankee (*coughKennyRodgerscough*).  "Deadwood" had its season finale. I love that show. So now it's just "Six Feet Under". Mena Suvari is going to play Claire's new lesbian, punk performer friend.  I'm going up to Massachussetts these next two weeks looking at Amherst, Williams, Tufts, Mount Holyoke, Smith, Brown, and Wellesley. I'm seeing Brown, Amherst and Williams this week, I believe, and the other four next week (I could be mistaken).  Well, I should go. Oh, look! A butterfly just landed on you. Namaste.

						   I'm back from Spain. It was, in one word, awesome. Madrid is a great city. The fact that I got to practice my Spanish was a bonus.  I also just got back from the college trip that I did right after I got home. Trust me: jet lag and college do not go well together. I went to the Connecticut schools I was checkint out: Yale, Wesleyan, and Connecticut College. I loved Yale and Connecticut College, but wasn't so hot on Wesleyan. At the moment, then, I'm up to three colleges on my "damn it, I want to go!" list: Connecticut College, Yale, and Bryn Mawr. In my school, when you compose the list of colleges, they have how likely you are to get into each. Very Likely means that it's really a safety school of sorts, Likely is just one step above that, Maybe means that there's a 50-50% shot, and Unlikely means it's a reach. They also do "Maybe-Unlikely" and the like for things that are on the border. Bryn Mawr is a very likely on my list, Connecticut College is a likely, and Yale is an unlikely for everyone in the world...except maybe a Bush. The other school's I've looked at but didn't like are as follows: Cornell was a maybe, Haverford was a maybe, Swarthmore was an unlikely (sexist pigs), and Wesleyan was a maybe.  Although people really shouldn't tell me how likely these things are, because I tend to walk into unlikely's with a grudge, thinking, "hell: you don't want me, I don't want you." My latest 800 on the Math IIC SAT II will help...now I have 2 800s to send in: Writing and Math, the two most important. 680 on the Bio isn't too bad either. It's my next highest. I managed to kill the SATIs though, with an 800 on Verbal and a 760 on Math. "Kill" is actually the word that my SAT tutors used too.  Oh, when I was in Spain - well I drank Sangria, but don't tell the teachers...my dad knows and doesn't care, but don't tell the teachers - but also there was this huge poster for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, which came out Thursday when I was there. There was like this ten-story high head of Harry Potter taking up a whole side of the building. Hermione and Ron's heads took up the other side. Funniest thing ever. Maybe I can figure out a way to post the picture I took of it when they come back. The day it opened I also saw a bunch of girls between the ages of 16 and like 20 in Hogwarts clothing with wands. I really want Hogwarts robes. It was amusing too, because these were definitely Goth Spanish girls in Hogwarts outfits: with the piercings and colorful hair and everything.  Well, that's about what I have to say. Next week I'm visiting more colleges...and the week after that. Oi vey.  Oh here: I bought you a sword from Toledo. Namaste.

						   I had my last final today! That means no more finals for the rest of high school. Seniors don't have to take finals (no point, really, as they're already into whatever college they're going to). I don't have school tomorrow, so I might see Shrek 2 with my mom. Then I have class day Friday. I leave for Spain on Sunday.  I'm going to see Harry Potter again tonight, as my dad didn't see it yet. So I'm rereading the series, and I definitely think I accidentally said out loud - rather than in my head - "Oh, Snape, why are you so sexy?" He's my favorite character. Then I thought, "Oh, Alan Rickman, why are  you  just as sexy, even though you're too old to be Snape?" Then I said the same thing about Sirius Black and Gary Oldman. I seem to have a thing for 40+-year old actors. Not to mention the fact that Alan Rickman's older than my mom...that's really just inappropriate when I think about it. I still hold to my assertion that David Thewlis, while awesome as Lupin, was not quite the right fit. I didn't like the stupid little mustache (no offense to people that have that ridiculous-looking thing on their own faces). He did play enough of a wise, father-figure type character for me, though.  I was just thinking about a conversation we had with my friend Hyun Jee the other day. She made the comment, "We should people with AIDS separate from other people so they don't spread it." We replied, "Er - Sunny? That's called a concentration camp." These are the types of conversations we have in my art class. The other day, she also expressed her desire to get implants even though she's already a C-cup. A small C-cup, mind you, but that's still the same size I have. I keep telling my friends that, hey, I'd give them a cup-size and we could both be B-cups. I think that would be fine. What do you think? Oh, where's an easily-embarrassed boy to say that to when you need him? Bwahaha...  So, the "Six Feet Under" premiere's on Sunday...and I'm going to be in Spain for it, which mean's I'll miss it. And the season finale of "Deadwood"'s that night too. I've been whining to no end about it.  Oh, and I still need to figure out an art concentration. I have absolutely no idea what I want to do. Maybe I could do scenes from Tolkien books...no, that would just make Tolkien spin in his grave a little faster than he already is. I'll have to think on it and get back to you.  Oh, in reference to the title, don't you just love making snap dragons snap? It's so much fun. Actually, you don't make them snap, really: more just open their mouths. Namaste.

						   The title's in keeping with the spirit of Harry Potter. I saw it on Friday (opening day here). So, it seems the New York Times is a big liar: the new movie's still only PG. I haven't written in the past few days because I've been doing a massive Virus/Adware cleanout on my computer. I think about everything's gone, thanks to Norton Anti-Virus and this SpyHunter software I downloaded.  I'm staying away from the personality quiz sites because it seems a lot of them spread disease. I'm pretty sure the only thing my computer didn't have was E. bola. Who knows: it may have had that too.  So, about Harry Potter. It was a pretty good movie: I don't think it can stand alone from the books, actually, but Cuaron is an improvement on Columbus. He has some amazing camera angles...and I actually like the kids' clothing better.  And I know the world is going to hit me for saying this, but about the Phelps twins (that play the Weasley twins): is it me or did they suddenly get rather good-looking? And did Daniel Radcliffe become a slightly better actor? I mean he can't fake cry for anything, but he isn't half as bad as in Chamber of Secrets.  I still don't entirely agree with all of the casting, but oh well. All the teachers (namely Snape, Black, and Lupin) seem rather older than I expected. Aren't they supposed to be about 35 or something? Oh well.  I haven't much else to say. Only two more finals to go, then I'm off for the year. Then I get to go to Spain for a week. SAT IIs were good at least.  Cover your ears! I'm about to repot it! Namaste.

						    urlLink    You are  Tsukino Usagi  You are love food, boys, shopping, and hanging out with your friends. You	tend to cry when things get too hard, and have trouble doing things right the first time.  You probably need to study a little harder. Your faith in the basic goodness of all people keeps you on the right track, even when others don't see it.  urlLink Take the "What Magic Girl are you?" Quiz   Hey, I took the "WHAT ANIMAL ARE YOU." personality quiz and my result was:  BALD EAGLE!  YOU ARE A FREEDOM FIGHTER. YOU WOULD RATHER DO STUFF BY YOURSELF BUT YOU CAN HANDLE IT IF OTHER PEOPLE WANT TO GET INVOLVED.  You can take this quiz at:  http://dragonhame.com/quiz/2486/   I had my first final today. I also had my piano lesson: I'm playing Schubert "Divertissement a la Hongroise" - Allegretto with my teacher for a concert next Tuesday. It's such a gorgeous piece. I play Segundo/Bottom/whatever you want to call it.  I forgot to ask my friend permission to use the link, but I'm going to lose it anyway. If you want to see my prom photos  urlLink here  they are. Aren't my friends so pretty? It's my friend's site, so I'm obviously not Laura, but take a wild guess which one's me.  I might see "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" tomorrow. I don't have any finals and I don't really have much to do. The review Elvis Mitchell gave was actually good. This one's rated PG-13, surprisingly. I actually thought that, judging by their rating criteria, the last one was "frightening" enough to be PG-13 too. Mitchell loved the adults and Cuaron's directing style. I love Cuaron too. I still say that the day Quentin Tarantino directs a Harry Potter is the day I'm getting involved, though. That would be one of the greatest things I'd ever see. I'd find a way to get to England to try out. I'd do anything to be in something like that.  Apparently the idiots that schedule these things scheduled the Tony's to be the same night as the last Sopranos episode (with...two Tony's, oddly enough...Tony S and Tony B). Hugh Jackman's hosting the Tony's and they say he'll be giving "Soprano updates". I'm watching The Sopranos and Deadwood instead anyway.  My dad got tickets to the U.S. Open (tennis) for this coming September. He and I are going. My mom doesn't really know any of the players, so she's not going. For some reason, my dad and I both know a good number of players. It's one of those things that, even though the camera angles are probably so much better on TV, it'd still be great to go to.  Here, I made the chain for you. Namaste.

						    urlLink     urlLink     My friend put prom pictures up on her site. I'm going to ask her permission before I link to them, though. I actually don't look to bad in the pictures. Everyone looked so gorgeous at the prom. I really wish someone had taken a picture when we got stuck in the elevator. It was really funny in retrospect. We decided to put fifteen people in the elevator, and we went below the ground level. We managed to hit the concrete on the bottom then get stuck. The door didn't open and we couldn't get out. We pressed the emergency button and paged security. Other prom attendees gathered outside the door and proceeded to sing "I know a song that gets on everybody's nerves..." as loud as they could until a friend of mine cursed them out through the door. Finally, we opened the door and climbed out of the elevator. Some of the girls were rather upset. I was actually fine - it got a little hot in the elevator, but I'm pretty good in small spaces. Having a picture of all of us would have been great. I think one or two people may have taken pictures. I'll look into it.  Is it me or are there more viruses on the computer lately? It's like all the lifeless hackers in the world decided to put up Trojans on every site. My virus scanner's been working overtime. My computer's rather old, too, with Windows 98. I'm not actually sure the scanner's been scanning every night though. It has been eliminating immediate errors, though, so that's good.  I have my math final tomorrow. Then I have Friday off. I have to go into school for art on Monday, I have bio on Tuesday, and English on Wednesday. Then I have no school Thursday, and Class Day's Friday. Then I'm all done with Junior Year. This Saturday coming up, I'm taking the Math IIC and Biology SAT II. That takes care of all of the boring areas of my life.  My second art piece for my final is actually not looking too bad. Hopefully I won't ruin it when I finish it.  I'm praying my computer doesn't just give out soon. It certainly sounds like it might. It already almost froze once when I was posting this.  Go visit my friend's blog if you're reading this. Here's the link:  urlLink I Run With Scissors  . She's a very cool person, so be very, very nice to her. Of course she's one of the only people that reads this, but oh well.  Well, that's really all that's important that's going on in my life. Check yourself for deerticks after you leave the grass. Namaste.

						    urlLink      urlLink      I'm in a fair bit of a quandary. I really want to tell my friends about this blog, but I also want to be myself here. Obviously if my friends came here, even if I used different names, they could figure out who I was talking about.  Technically, I'm a senior now. The seniors aren't in school - actually, they left on their senior trip already - so we're the oldest. We already infested the senior hallway. Finals also start day after tomorrow. Then I have SAT IIs as well. Then it's off to Spain for a week.  Boy, my life is boring at the moment. I wanted to keep a regular posting up, though. I e-mailed Phil, though. Hopefully everything's cool with him. If not, well then there's not much I can do about it. He may not even have access to a computer for all I know. You know, he was one of the few things keeping his brother in line, in my opinion. I could be wrong, as I didn't know them really well, but that's the impression I got from my first meetings with the two.  Apparently two of my friends that hated each other finally decided to stop pretending to endure each other. I'm not sure whether they're speaking or not. It happened in an Art class I didn't go to because I was done with my piece. It wasn't so much what she did, I don't think, as that he had a lot of rage saved up, and it just all let out with her moving the pieces. I'm actually...on neither of their sides, really. Both do have a rather large self-image. I apologize if either of them find this page, but you both do sometimes at least say things that suggest high self-regard. I love you both though, and respect that you don't get along. Actually, I'm not even that close with either of you. Wish I could've been there when the roof blew off, though.  I only have to take three written finals: math, bio, English. Then I have my art meeting on Monday to critique our pieces. I would prefer if he didn't do it in front of the rest of the class, but we can't have everything. I just have to finish this second piece and then go back to work on the first. I'm not sure either's brilliant, but they'll do, suppose. As I said earlier, I can't do Monet in like two weeks. I could probably never do Monet, but that's not really the point. You know, I'm not completely satisfied with any of my concentration ideas, but I have the whole summer and part of the fall to work it out.  Here, have some parsley potpourri for your time. Namaste.

						   This is my last post for a month (as though I was posting too regularly anyway, right?). I'm going away to Western New York for four weeks, and I don't have a computer up there. Technically, I could buy time, but one, I'm cheap, and two, I don't really  need  to do so. It's sort of my time away from you guys. No offense, I love you all to death, but everyone needs a break.  I finished up my school interviews. Now I just have to complete the Common Application, copy it a zillion times, and write my college essays. I kind of know what I'm going to talk about already, but I'll flush out the idea a bit more when I'm away.  So, have any of you been following the Democratic National Convention? I've been following when my dad hasn't been around, since he can't tolerate politicians. I find it fascinating, personally. I wish that I were there. I am going to be here, in New York, for the Republican National Convention. However, the conservatives scare me a bit. On September third, I'm going to be heading to the U.S. Open, so we'll have to go  around  the Republicans. My dad made the joke, "What's worse than a trainful of conservatives?&nbsp;A trainful of liberals!" I, being the liberal I am, shot him an evil look and corrected him. "What's worse than a trainful of conservatives? A trainful of Red Sox fans!" That's something we both can agree on - no offense, GOTO. Well, yes offense to the Red Sox, but not to you specifically: you're one of the good ones.  As I'm not Christian, I'm not really a praying person, but my best wishes are with Jason Giambi. I really hope they find out what's wrong with him soon. I'm starting to worry about him myself. At first he was pretty good at concealing his own concern, but now that they keep going with the tests, it's obvious he's becoming more and more concerned himself. I just hope there's nothing horrifically wrong with him. He's a great first baseman, and while I love Tony Clark with all my heart, I miss him dearly.  Dominic Monaghan's apparently going to be in a new show called  Lost  on ABC TV. I saw one commercial for it...looks like an awful show. It's about people getting stranded after a plain crash. Now you know what  would  be good (and funny)? A reality show with Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, and Orlando Bloom. But then throw in: three girls that smoke, three girls that are Anglophobes (for whatever reason), and three teeny boppers. The nine girls and the three guys must survive. It comes down to who walks out alive. The trio that lives walks out with a whole bunch of money. I couldn't see Bloom lasting an hour, Dom would freak out with the smoking girls, and Billy...well, I could see him being fine. Throw in three goths that hate the other twelve contestants and you'd have a show.  Well, I'm off. Take care of yourselves. I'll leave the gate open for you to play in here while I'm away. Namaste.

						   So I visited Barnard today. It’s really great: it’s small, homey-feeling, but in New York City. You know, if I do end up somewhere else, I don’t know how I’ll survive without New York a stone’s throw away. I mean how will I live without the Met, the Museum of Natural History, Broadway, Yankee games, art galleries, and everything the city has to offer? That’s why I don’t want to go to another city college unless it’s New York. My dad is actually rather uncomfortable with the thought of his little girl living in the city, actually, so I may end up not even applying. I still have time to think about that, though.  I think the fact that Barnard’s right across from Columbia is great too. You can take as many courses as you want there without having to deal with how big the college is. A friend of mine is actually going to Columbia: she wants to be an English major. You have so many resources in New York at your fingertips – that’s one of the reasons I wanted to check Barnard out. Also my friend from school’s mother works in the library there. She said, "You’re looking at all-girl schools and you’re not seeing Barnard?" So basically we had to go down and check it out. My mom also loved it.  I was describing the college process to my mother today and I came up with a metaphor that about sums up the college process. It’s like a circle of prostitution. First the college tries to degrade itself in order to get you to apply. You go on tours and information sessions and they say "such-and-such is why we’re the best school for you in the country and why you should apply – now does anyone want an application please?" So they try to get you to apply. Then you sell yourself back when you interview and apply, saying, "please, please, I am selling my body and soul to you: let me go to this college." Then they, in turn, lower themselves when they accept you, trying to convince you that they really,  really ,   really  &nbsp;want you to go there. Finally, you sell your physical self to the school for four years…after getting screwed by the ridiculously high tuition.  Tomorrow I also have my Connecticut College interview. Since we’re so close, we might check out the aquarium nearby, as we have not been there for years. That is, of course, if it turns out that we have extra time after the interview.  And that’s really all that’s drastically new in my life. Namaste.

						   Wow, it looks like they really updated the site since I was last on: I can put images and quotes in and stuff. Where was this when I wanted to upload a picture to this site in order to put it on another webpage? Oh well, such is life.  &nbsp;  I got new glasses. I got my last pair when I got my glasses when I was like ten, and haven't changed the prescription in them since I was like twelve or thirteen. In other words, finally, I have cute glasses that I can see through! Actually, I really like them.&nbsp; Here's an image:    The frames are actually a sort of blue color. It was between a pair with purple frames and a pair with blue frames. My mom said, "I love the purple; purple's my color," but when she said that, I realized that blue was really my color so I went with the blue.&nbsp;  I just came back from my friend's pool party. She threw the party for another friend of mine named Andrea&nbsp;that was in the country for just a little while. Andrea moved to Uruguay in Junior High school and I haven't seen her since then. I don't know whether she was looking at colleges here or just visiting, but it was nice to see her again. Actually, we got along better today than I believe we ever did when she lived here. We were discussing what happened to other people, Carson moving to Italy and the like, while she wasn't here. She was talking about how she comes back, hears that our old school principal died, and how they're demolishing the old Elementary School. It was like destroying her childhood. However, the new school buildings are going to be great. She won't really be there to see them though. Come to think of it, I won't really get to appreciate them really either, as this will be my last year at the school. They say that it will be done by January, but the originally said by the end of last year, by the beginning of this year, and now January. So, basically I'll believe that they will finish it when I see it.  &nbsp;  I've done three of my six college interviews. I just have Barnard, Connecticut College, and Yale left. Amherst doesn't do interviews for whatever reason, so I don't have to think about that. You know, with only 1600 undergraduates one would think that they  would  do interviews and the like. Three or four of the six or seven schools (depending on my impression of Barnard) that I'm applying to are all female. That's kind of odd, if you think about it. It doesn't really matter to me, though.  &nbsp;  My friend Moira was in Texas in the El Paso region for four weeks. She came back with a really dark tan and a lot of scratches. Apparently all the plants where she was have thorns and attack humans. She has a huge scratch on her back.  &nbsp;  The pool party itself was good, though. Only Moira, Laura, Chris D., GregL., and I actually went into the pool, but that's okay. And by "go into the pool," that means that Laura sort of stood on the edge and occasionally cuddled with Chris while Moira, Chris, Greg, and I tried to dunk each other. When Moira got out and Chris and Greg started making "Water Techno" (you don't want to know), I decided to climb out too. Sascha, a girl that used to go to my school, was also there. I hadn't actually spoken to her since she left school. She visited, but I never really had a chance to talk to her.  &nbsp;  I mention "dancing in the rain" because it was raining here a lot today. It waited until I finished horseback riding, but it rained during the party. People kept saying, "I don't want to go in! It's raining!" Moira and I kept responding, "What's rain made out of? And what fills a swimming pool? It's water either way." After we went inside it started raining harder, so Michelle, Laura, Chris M., and I went out in the rain. Basically I've been soaking wet since 12:30 this afternoon, when I took a shower after horseback riding. I didn't dry off before I jumped into the pool. Then I wandered out into the pouring rain just as I was about to dry off after that. Then I went home and took a shower to wash the chlorine out of my hair (that stuff is lethal to hair texture). I like water though, so it's okay.  &nbsp;  I was discussing the swimming tests at some of the schools I'm applying to with Moira. It came up because she was talking about how she can't float. I mentioned that a lot of the schools make you float for two minutes, along with demonstrate two strokes and treading water for a minute. I can do all of that, obviously, but I might start getting a little lower in the water by the end of the two minute float. My parents once asked me why they have the swim test. I answered, "Um...in case you're on an important business meeting and you happen to fall off the yacht? I don't know." I guess swimming is a pretty basic skill to have. I was speaking to a girl from China on one of the Forums I go to, and she was saying that she can't really swim. I was thinking about it and that's rather odd. I sort of take swimming for granted because, at least on the East Coast, it's one of "those" things that every small child learns for the most part.  &nbsp;  I don't really have much else to talk about. There are towels inside when you get tired of the rain. Namaste.

						   Do I sense a little bit of hostility from Isabel in that last Comment? Is someone a bit oversensitive about her Red Sox? What's that I hear? The Tampa Bay Devil Rays are catching up to the Red Sox? Really? And why did the Rays fall another game behind the Sox? Oh, that's right: the Yankees beat them last night and are therefore six games ahead of the Sox. Heehee...love you too, Isabel.  Apparently someone got injured and can't play in the All-Star Game. For some bizarre reason they decided that the Yankee pitcher, Javier Vasquez, was a good choice to replace him. Of all the players in the American League, why Vasquez? As happy as I am that it brings the grand total of Yankees on the AL All-Star Team up to eight, Vasquez is  not  an All-Star.  Derek Jeter got the stitches on his chin out. Now he's back to his beautiful self.  But away from the Yankees (also known as my fifth oxygen), I made my interview dates for colleges. I am going to have what is known as no life until August.  Have you ever seen the MTV show "Your Face or Mine"? It's one of the more amusing things on out there. First they (a couple) compare random celebrities and try to match the majority of the audience selections as to which is more attractive. Then they have to guess which of their moms the audience will think is better looking. Then they compare themselves to pictures and holograms. They then have to compare their boyfriend/girlfriend to best friends/ex-girlfriends/ex-girlfriends' best friends/etc. Finally, they have to figure out between the two of them which one is more attractive. If they match audience selections, they win money. On the final question, if they mess up, they lose all their money. If they get it right, they double it. It's becoming one of my "guilty pleasure" shows...along with Boy Meets World reruns.  I forgot to enter my Spain Trip quotes, didn't I? Well, here are some of the top ones: Erin: Ooo! Do me! Do me! ( Actually said when Darren was taking pictures in the elevator. The phrase Erin was looking for was, "Ooo! Take a picture of me in the elevator! )  Laura: Her boobs look like Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer. ( In reference to a Miró painting )  Harrison: ( Jumps out from behind a wall at the Spanish Civil War Memorial, in the shape of a giant cross. ) Boo! Soyoung: Jesus Christ! Harrison: Haha! Nailed it! Jennie: Erm...did anyone else notice that?  Tim: Jennie, why are you such a control freak?  Jennie: Let me see your ticket. Harrison: No. Jennie: I just want to see it. Harrison: Here. ( Shows the ticket. ) Jennie: Let me hold it. Harrison: No! You can see it. Jennie: ( Unsuccessfully grabs for the ticket ) I want to touch it! Harrison: You can't touch it! You can see it! Are you blind? Jennie: Yes I am, I need to touch it! Harrison: Well you can't touch it! Jennie: Let me touch it! Harrison: No! Jennie: I need to touch it! Me: ( Just beginning to listen at the Let me touch it! No! part ) Uh, do you know what you sound like? What are you trying to touch anyway? Jennie: The ticket! Give me the ticket! Harrison: No! Jennie: ( Turns to me ) Can I see your ticket for a second? ( Grabs my ticket without asking ) Me: Ummm... Jennie: ( Looks briefly and hands it back ) Thanks. Harrison: That was it? Why couldn't you just see it? Why'd you have to touch it? Jennie: Well, I could have just looked at it, but you were so uptight about letting me touch it, I just had to touch it. Harrison: You're making no sense! You couldn't touch it so you had to touch it because you couldn't touch it? Jennie: Uh, yeah. ( This took place in the theater in which we saw a Flamenco-Ballet Crossover...was interesting, to say the least. Jennie and Harrison were bickering like this the whole trip. It made for some amusing intertainment. )  Jennie: So then we went up... Alex: Wait! Up where? Me: The stairs? To heaven? Jennie: To Vermont! ... Jennie: So then when we went down... Alex: Down where? Me: The stairs? To hell? Something sexual that I don't even want to imagine at the moment? Jennie: To Hawaii! Okay: New York is the central location in all these stories Me: That's not really down. Alex: It's more over, really. Harrison: It's West-Down. Alex: Okay, so you went West-Down, then...  Laura: ( Wakes up on the plane .) Are we there? Kat: No, we made an emergency stop in Newfoundland. Laura: Where in Europe's that again? Wait. Oh fuck. You're kidding. We're still in Canada? Kat: Yup. Laura: No. We had to have crossed an ocean. Why are we in  Canada? ! Hasn't it been like five hours? Kat: Umm...no, it's been two hours.   Whole scene : It's about three in the morning. I'm sitting next to Sarita and Chris is across the aisle. We're flipping through the radio stations. Chris finds a club mix station. He indicates that we should all change. We sit there in the dark, with the rest of the plane asleep, dancing in our seats. I change the station and find Winnie zie Pooh in German. I have them change their radio stations. The demonic sounding voice comes on as Pooh's voice. Chris's eyes go wide and he throws his earphones off. Then we change the channel and find the Therapeutic channel, where they talk about visualizing a field of calm daisies. Then we go back to the club mix and dance some more.  Our Tour Guide: It is the most beautiful painting in the world...except for France.  So, that's my trip to Madrid in one page. Hope you can come with me next time! Namaste.

						   I'm back from my last overnight college visit! So my list stands as follows: Yale (a reach) Amherst (a reach) Connecticut College Wellesley Bryn Mawr (a safety) Mount Holyoke (a safety) The last three are all-female, but you know that doesn't really matter to me. I'm still into International Relations, and though only Mount Holyoke, Connecticut College, and Wellesley have actual majors for that, the others have Political Sciences and Government and the like, which concentrates on International Relations. Yale has International Studies for undergraduates and International Relations in its graduate school. Yale is really beautiful, though. I think it is my first choice at the moment. It's ridiculously hard to get into though: only like an 8% chance - 16 if you have a legacy, which I don't. The way the Connecticut College guys eyes nearly popped out of his head when he heard what school I go to, I think I have a pretty good chance of getting in there too.  It's not that the all-women's colleges are bad: in fact they are voted some of the best colleges in the country. However, the fact that they're single-sex eliminates about half the applying body. A lot of girls won't apply either, because they need boys. As I said, that doesn't really matter to me. Smith College - another all-female school - is also pretty nice (and it has horseback riding), but it would be at the bottom of my list, and it's another safety. Two safeties are enough. In my opinion, the Holyoke girls sounded more intelligent than the Smith girls (they're in the same area: near Amherst; there's a five-college consortium that they're part of).  Of the schools that I'm thinking of, it seems that Connecticut College has the best Study Abroad programs. That's what I'm really interested in too. All the schools have Study Abroad, but Connecticut College has some great program options. Yale actually discourages Study Abroad. I mean they wouldn't not let you, but they prefer you to stay on campus all four years. With all the things that go on for those four years, I actually don't really blame the kids that stay. The college-housing system is really cool.  Oh, my friend that wasn't at his house anymore e-mailed. He's okay, which means that I don't have to worry anymore. Don't you love how I can meet someone, know them for half a week, then freak out when something happens? Oi vey.  Speaking of "oi vey", the Yankees need to start winning. We've lost five out of the last six games. Sweeping the Red Sox (haha!) doesn't count for anything if we lose first place to them. I really hope that Tampa Bay catches them too. Imagine Boston if the Red Sox didn't even get Wild Card?  Actually Wellesley and Tufts aren't too far from Boston (two schools I looked at). I'm really not a big fan of Boston, though. It's an okay city, it's just not my type of place. It's just not...New York. That's why I couldn't go to a college in a city other than New York: I'd be comparing it to New York the whole time. Suburbs are fine: as long as there's a larger town or city nearby I'm happy.  Well, I'm off, as there's no more to say! I'll leave the gate open so you can stay in the garden as late as you want. Namaste.
