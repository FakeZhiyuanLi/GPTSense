      My girlfriend has the most annoying habit of picking her nose in public.&nbsp; My other girlfriends and I always tell her to stop or walk around with tissue.&nbsp; Of course, going to the bathroom would be fine too.&nbsp; It doesn’t matter where we are.&nbsp; We could be in the mall, at a restaurant, or taking our kids on an outing, she will pick her nose.&nbsp;   When I first noticed that my friend didn’t care where she picked her nose, I use to laugh about it.&nbsp; My friends and I would tell jokes about it.&nbsp; When we have functions with our husbands, her husband would make jokes about his wife picking her nose everywhere.  Now though it’s getting a little annoying.&nbsp; No matter who tells her how rude and just plain icky it is, my friend will not stop digging for gold.&nbsp; During a very busy night at this restaurant I became upset with my friend for doing u know what.&nbsp; I tried telling her that people were looking at her and that the bathroom was not too far from our table.&nbsp; She took offense and told me what she does is a natural thing and so what if people want to stare.&nbsp; Her response led to an argument right in the restaurant.&nbsp; Fortunately, some of the people watching thought we were funny.&nbsp; My friend and I laughed along with them.&nbsp; It’s wonderful that we are so close that we could curse each other out and laugh about it after the beef.  I now just think my friend need some kind of therapy to stop picking her nose in public.&nbsp; Of course I’m just playing by saying that but that’s how I deal with her doing it.&nbsp; To keep myself from getting more annoyed I’ll tell myself that my friend needs psychological help.&nbsp; Yup that’s it, the girl is mad.&nbsp; Her insanity lead her to be a compulsive nose picker.&nbsp;   My sister friend is the best besides her annoying habit.&nbsp; I wouldn’t trade her for anything.&nbsp; I just have to live with her flaws.&nbsp; I’m going to ask her if I have any habits that bother her.&nbsp; Whatever it is I’m sure it’s a natural thing.&nbsp;

      I'm seeking a college education for a number of reasons.&nbsp; First reason is to have better self esteem.&nbsp; Second is to get a degree.&nbsp; Third is to get a better paying job.&nbsp;  I thought it was time for me to go back to school mainly because I'm getting older and I feel insecure about the way I speak.&nbsp; Sometimes in conversations I will wonder if I'm using a certain word correctly.&nbsp; Or I will wonder if I'm using correct grammer.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I also decided to go back to school because I wanted to get a degree.&nbsp; I thought obtaining an accociates degree would be the safest way for me to go, since it would only take me eighteen months to get.&nbsp; I never liked school and would often start taking courses and never finish.&nbsp; I think the difference with now is that I know that If I don't continue my education now that I would continue to procrastinate and just accept entry level jobs. &nbsp; Getting a better paying job is really important to me.&nbsp; I don't think that I should settle for postions that require no skill.&nbsp; Even though I have pc skills and experience with different positions, when applying for jobs I'm limited.&nbsp; Most job postings will have certain requirements that I don't have.&nbsp; There's no reason why I should'nt have certain skills. &nbsp; I've set a goal for each semester and hope to follow through.&nbsp; In the past with school I did not set a goal.&nbsp; I think that was my mistake.&nbsp; I have to want more for myself and work hard to achieve.&nbsp; I'm hoping to stay focused and obtain my degree.

      My name is Heather Grant.  I'm 27 years old.  I'm married and have one daughter whose six years old.  I'm from Mt. Vernon, NY.  I moved to Norwalk in 1993 during my first year of high school.  I have three brothers and one sister.  Two of my brothers are by my mother.  My other brother and sister who were born the same year as myself are from my father.  Yes poppa was a rolling stone.  Unfortunately he was’nt a rolling stone for long because he became incarcerated when we turned two.  To make a long story short about that, my father retaliated against the people that killed his brother, who for some reason thought it was ok to attend my father’s brother funeral.  Anyway, my mother was left to care for my brother and I.  She remarried a few years later.  Actually she remarried when I was seven.  A few years after that, my little brother was born.  Life was good so far.  I attended Catholic school during my elementary years.  During that time I took gymnastics, tap and ballet.  Money became a little tight so for middle school my mother put me into public school.  That’s when my life becomes a little more interesting.  Attending a public school after being in a Catholic school was a whole new world to me.  I was use to teachers being down my back and knowing my every move.  In public school I was able to or tried to do almost anything I wanted.  I would cut class, eat in class, talk back to the teachers, and just be a juvenile delinquent.  Of course living around the corner from the main drug dealing block did’nt help.  I started hanging out with some friends only to have my mother marching up the block looking for me.  She then moved us to CT.  I was real rebellious after the move.  I did not want to adjust at all.  I would run away and continue to be a menace to my mom.  I finally calmed down, like now, at 27 years old, believe it or not.  I just think it’s time for me to grow up and do something with my life for myself and most importantly for my daughter.  I still live day to day but I’m more cautious.  I thinks that’s it.

      My absolute favorite rapper is Ghostface Killah....ok i know that sounds corny so let me switch that a little.  I'm luv'n Tony Starks style!!!  That piece of man is so gotdam sexy.  His voice alone is the absolute bomb.  I love the way he takes the back in the day songs and remix them with a hip hop beat and just flow.  When I say flow I mean rap to the beat and just be on point with what that back in the day song is about.  My  husband know how I feel about Ghost.  He doesn't care.  I guess he think since he's someone on t.v. I won't have access to him.  Hmmmmmm I won't.  Yeah whatever.  No sir, I would never jeopardize my marriage.  Devil I rebuke you. lol  I went to see Ghost in concert.  I actually saw him twice in concert.  I know that does'nt sound like a real fan.  But hey a sista got to work and pay bills.  Anyway the first time I saw him was at Jay Z's last concert.  Ghostface performed with Beyonce.  I nearly passed out!  I did not know he was going to be there.  My husband was right by my side so I could'nt act up.  I then saw him when he came to a little spot in CT.  My girl called me the day he was coming.  I was not prepared to go anywhere.  My behind got ready so quick, she did'nt get a chance to hang up the phone after telling me....just playing.  So I went to see Theodore!!  You don't understand how I felt.  I could'nt believe how I was feeling.  I was like, let me find out I'm a Ghostface Killah akaTheodore aka Tony Starks groupie.  Now I understand groupies!!  I totally feel their pain and urge.  Ok let me get a hold of myself.  So Ghost is doing his thang on stage.  The whole time I'm thinking he's talking and dancing with me especially when the old school joints he raps to start to play.  Finally the show is over and all the ladies are running on stage to meet him.  I just could'nt get enough nerve to go.  I totally froze.  My girl was trying everything to get me to go up but for some reason I just could'nt.  So now I wonder what would he have said to me.  I guess I'll never know.

      After reading the article Barbie at 35,  I was a little confused.  It started off with critizing Barbie then led to what white and black girls think of themselves.  I think the lady that wrote Barbie at 35 had some mental issues and was probably fat.  I think there are more important things to worry about than some damn Barbie doll.  I don’t believe Barbie has anything to do with the insecurities young girls may have.  For her to not allow her daughter to play with them was a little wacky too.  I wonder if she didn’t let her watch TV or read books as well.  I mean so what that Barbie looks great without clothes on.  So what she has many occupations and can play any sport.  So what her body measurements are so perfect that if she were real she wouldn’t have any muscles.  Barbie is just a doll that was made to give girls the encouragement to be whatever they want. I have a six year old who loves Barbie dolls.  I think the doll is great and positive.  Not once have my daughter said anything about her body or wanting to have a Barbie doll figure.  She loves the different themes, occupations, and the different races Barbie portrays. Someone need to tell the author of Barbie at 35 to pick on someone her own size.  I respect everyone’s opinions but this one, to me, is a little off the wall.

      I feel strongly about having metal detectors in public high schools.  I mainly feel that way because of all the violence that has been going on in the schools around the country.  I also feel that way because there are parents that don’t give their kids the attention needed to see if something is affecting their childs life.  Perfect example is when violence happens in a school and is shown by the media, when interviewing the parents they always say they did’nt know their kid was having problems.  I think communication is very important when having a teenager in high school.  There is so much happening and many issues affecting our youth.  There’s gangs, bullies, sexual offenders, drug dealers and drug users in high school.  With all of that there is but so much hall monitors can do.  With metal detectors it would make the high schools safe. By being a parent I want the best education for my child and want to be at ease when it comes to security at school.  I don’t want to worry when dropping her off that she could possibly be hurt or killed by a gun or knife.Installing metal detectors at high schools will definitely be beneficial in helping the schools maintain safety.
