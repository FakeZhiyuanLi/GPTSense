      Now I know how this works! This isn't too bad actually. Right, I f*cked up some details so here we go! I'm Ben, 17 years old, short and annoying and I live in Thatcham which is in West Berkshire. It's a shitty boring place but it's near Reading where all the exciting shit happens. I have a group of close friends I go skateboarding with and occasionally delve into other sports like Downhill. I play guitar and am currently in a band called Dark Halo. Don't tell anyone but I'm the vocalist. Keep it quiet cos in all honesty, it's fucking embarressing! I can't be fucked to censor this any more. Chances are Blogg Fucker will do it for me. Still, very little to know about me really. I used to go to college but now work at Office World. Ain't a bad job, we have a laugh and basically do fuck all work. I listen to music there and just have a doss. By the way, I'm a mosher. I'm into Death Metal, Nu-Metal, Thrash Metal, Old Metal, Rock, Hardcore Punk and some ska and good old fashioned happy punk like the naked Apes. Seen em a few times in Newbury, reccomend em to punk fans. Really good laugh. I'm not into drugs really and don't drink as much as I used to. Trying to cut down as I'm older and realised that I will need a liver transplant probably in the next couple of years. Still, better to fix things late than never i guess! I'm not single (Sorry ladies! lol) and I'm going out with a girl called Caroline. We've been together over 7 months and are awsomely happy just so ya know. And yes, it is love :) I won't say too much about her because she'll get scared about what I'm writing and will probably slap me for it anyway. Still, she's beautiful, sexy, smart, funny, kind, caring, soft and, as far as I can tell, perfect in every way! lol My pride and joy is my ESP M-107 7 string electric guitar which I never seem to stop playing. I am rarely caught without my guitar in my hand. My best friend Dan play's the bass and is hopefully going to be bassist for my band, Dark Halo. We started it together but then he left for another and may soon be returning to my band but who knows! I don't think there is really anything else to say about me. Physically, I'm 5ft 5, tanned, dark hair, blue eyes, slim and strangely hyper active. My theory is, im short so too much sugar will make me explode... Yep, i'm a regular biologist as you can tell. Well that's it for me. Peace out yo (Blatent piss-take of townies)
