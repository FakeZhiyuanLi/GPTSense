      2day is a boring day. I woke up at 11am, called John he was still sleeping. My sister was supposed to take me to go get my depo-shot (birth control) at 11:30am and of course she wasnt awake, so I had to reschedule my appointment and luckily I can go today at 5:00pm, my sister better not screw this up. and then I have to go get my book for my english project that due on the first day of school and I havent even read the book, and I have like 50 questions to answer, and 20 vocab words to define, and AHHH!!!! Crazy, but me always putting things off til last minute, I'll get it done, hehe, or I'm hoping so. But anyways, I think I'm going to start putting some of my poetry on here, but not right now, because I dont have time. Gots to fly. Love ya'll!!!!  ***The biggest things can be done in the littlest time***

      Well yesterday was mine and John's 9 month anniversary. I spent the night at Missy's the night before it, and Missy's brother Dusty spent the night at John's the night before, so John and Dusty rode their bikes to Missy's in the morning and john and I then walked to my sisters and she took us out to lunch at Chili's and then back to my house so I could change and then we went to the movies and saw "White Chicks" It was Hilarous!!!!!! John and I had such a great time. things just felt so right and we were happy and together, and even though through out the day we had argued. *the day didnt start out too well, but I dont want to get into that* Anyways, Our anniversary was great and we're great and I couldnt be happier!!!  I LOVE JOHNNY JAMES MCGRATH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Gotta go. Love ya'll!!!!!!  ***Happiness, comes to those who wait***

      Well I saw John yesterday ALL DAY!!!!!!!!! It was great. I've missed just laying with him and wrestling with him. Everything just totally seems to be getting so much better and I couldn't be happier. I love him so much. We've talked about everything and last night he was reading a note I wrote him and he started crying because it was saying how much I loved him, and he feels like he hasn't been treating me right and he doesn't want to lose me because I am the best thing that happened to him and he's just scared that I'm going to leave him, but I reassured him that everything was fine and I WOULD NEVER LEAVE HIM!!!!!! I love our relationship, we talk and we understand each other. I can't want to marry him!!!!  But on a sadder note, my friend Sean, went into a diabetic seizure on Tuesday night because he took 13 triple c's smoked weed and coke. Yeah, pretty dumb but he's alright now. Dusty and John got caught too but their parents weren't notified. John and Dusty and Danny can never hang out with Sean again. I just hope everyone learned a lesson from this. Danny and Sean say there done with everything, John wasn't even on anything he was just there, and Dusty said he's just never doing coke again. Yeah, we all had a little scare there, but now everythings good.  Well I have to go clean my room. Love ya'll!! ~*CaSeY*~   ***When you love someone all your saved up wishes start coming out***

      Well john didnt go to jail today, his next court date is July 12th and if he's clean up until then he'll be done but still has probation but I'm not too sure how long, but if he gets into trouble before the 12th, he'll go to Juvi for 60 days!!! So I really hope he gets his act together and it looks like things will be okay. I mean I always knew they would be but it was just getting so damn hard to even see positive at all. But I'm really just looking forward to spending time with my baby! I'm getting my license soon and I have a car, but that now means, I have to get a job. :( Oh well, with privledges come resposibility...hehe. gotta go!!!!!  ***Looking through the bad, is the best way around a tough situation***

      Well nothings really wrong, just sitting around really. I spent the night at John's the other night, I hadnt seen him in forever, but now I dont get to see him until God knows when. He goes to court on the 22nd and supposably is going to this dentention place for 5 days...God, I hate having to deal with this. I talked to him about it to, I just hope he fucking realizes that this shit is killing me. I love him so much and I deserve to have things better. I deserve to be able to see my boyfriend whenever I want. Idk, I'm just kinda sad right now. So im going to go.  ***The greatest things in life are those left unexplained***

         John promises things will turn around soon. And I really just hope he gets his act together. It's so emotionally draining to deal with all this shit. I mean not knowing when I'm going to see him, or what hes doing and how much trouble he's getting into, is so nerve racking...I love him so incredibly much and I just want things to be totally happy and easy for us. I just want all this bad shit to be put behind us, and I really want to him to stop getting into trouble. I dont know how much more I can take. I'm going to spend the rest of my life with him, I just want it to be easier. I just want to be able to see him when I want to see him and for us to do things like a normal couple and have fun. I pray to God that things turn around and we get through all this shit and never go back to it. I love John, so much and nothing will change how much I love him.  I gots to fly...laters!!!!!! Love ya'll!!!!!  ***Things will get better, sooner or later***

      Okay well, I have a friend her name is *Morgan* and she happens to be 3 weeks late with her period. She's only slept with one person but she's too in denial to take a pregnancy test. She's really starting to tick me and all my friends off. A guy friend of mine even offered to buy her the test and she still said no. Any words of advice on how to get through to my friend? Another things is she's been drinking alot even after she knew she was late, please anyone with words of encouragement!!!  Okay another friend of mine, *David* he has a problem accusing people of things. And no matter how much you say or can even prove that you didnt do the thing he was accusing you of, he still has a way of making people think you did that thing. It's really annoying. Any ideas on how to get through to him?      Well I have to go put my room back together now, so please right me back some comments, I would really appreciate it! Love ya'll!!!  ***We're not the brightest crayon in the box, now are we?***

      Well John moved back to his mom's today.Not too sure if it's a good thing or bad thing. I'm just so afraid he's going to get into the same shit again. But when he lived with his dad, nothing really stopped him except his dad was stricter than his mom. But when he lived at his dad's it put a HUGE damper on our relationship because he was so far away and it was difficult for us to see one another, its just so hard. I just wish I could jump in his head and let him feel the things I feel and how bad I freak out when he does this crap. I really hope he learns his damn lesson...I love him so much, and I hate when I can't reach him.   Gotta go...tootles!!!  ***Look forward to a brighter day, the sun has to rise sooner or later***

      Hey. Well he did it. He messed up again. He failed yet Another UA. Gosh! When will he learn? I knew his luck was going to run out and he didn't listen to me, when he KNEW I was right!!!!! Anyways, he goes to court on the 22nd and according to his P.O. he'll get 5 days in this detention hall place. Oh well, there's nothing I can do besides go crazy because I can't stop him. His grandma even said "Well obviously she's not a good enough girlfriend because she can't stop you from doing drugs." and shes right. But I dont blame myself because its him that wont listen to me. But anyhoo, Enough about that...  My room is FINALLY painted. (Light Pink) and I still have to paint my shelves and trim black. Then I'm getting star sponges and hot pink paint and making a star border across the top. cuteness!!! I cant wait for it all to be done. I think I'm getting a new bed and dresser too. Oh, I'm so excited I Love This Kind Of Stuff!!!  Well I'm going to bizounce...hehe. Love ya'll!!!!  ***Sometimes you just got to be okay with not doing anything***

       Well&nbsp; John only went for 5 days. So I'm not sad anymore. He said he learned alot and realized how dangerous things were, and he's done smoking until he's off probation and that won't be until next summer. I am just so damn glad he's back. I've missed him like crazy. We hung out today but we were bored and were going to go to the trailer park but my parents wouldnt let me go, so he&nbsp;left at 6:00 to go see Matt and Janet. I told him to call me when he gets home. I'm going over to Janet's tomorrow around noon or so, when she gets home from church. And John's supposed to go over there sometime. I'm just so happy! I can't even explain it. G2G!!~ Love ~*CaSeY*~    &nbsp;  ***Happiness comes to those who wait***

       Okay, well John went to Juvi on the 12th, for 10 days. Or so I think. I'm too scared to call his mom and ask for sure, when he'll be out. I've been pretty bummed this past week, but I've been with Missy and Janet and a whole bunch of other people to keep myself sane. but at night, i just lose it. I mean, Monday morning I talked to John before he went and when we got off the fone, I bawled for like 2 hours, and then we went to Missys (cause her and janet spent the night that night) and I cried for awhile when I got there, and then tuesday night, i got drunk, stupid of me but oh well. Wednesday, I cried for a little bit, but then Janet cheered me up and told me that he's okay and that things are going to get better. And today I havent cried yet, but I know I will tonight! It just sucks. It feels so WRONG, not being able to talk to him...I mean like part of my life is missing. Well I got another week. Hopefully ill build the balls to call his mom and find out exactly whats going on. But I'm going to go now. Laters!!!    &nbsp;  ***How can you smile with all those tears in your eyes?***

      Well things to a turn for the worse, again. I'm just so sick of things going wrong. John got into trouble and then we decided I was going to sneak over to his house and we got caught so now I'm grounded. It really blows. But yeah, my 4th sucked too, because I was grounded. Oh well, there's nothing I can do about it now. I've just got to deal with it. I think I'm going to go get my license soon! I can't wait, I have this old white beat up car, that we're fixing up, but hey, I dont care. its a car, and it drives!!!!!! But Im going to go now. Love ya'll. Talk to you soon! ~*CaSeY*~  ***Always look on the bright side***

       Its offically over! Summer, my sweet summer is gone. Just playing...but yes, tomorrow we all go back to lovely high school. YAY! (haha, j/k) But yes, its amazing how quickly time flies. I went to Smith today and it was so crazy to go back there and I can't even begin to explain the memories that came rushing back to me, just by walking those halls. I mean I cant wait to get out and move on with my life but then part of me just wants to go back and be that little naive 8th grader. I only have ONE more summer left until I'm done. I can't believe it!!!! I'm gunna bust my ass this year and just coast my way my senior year until graduation (hopefully) But I'm going to bizounce. Later dudes! ~*CaSeY*~

      I know we've all been there, To that place when you feel so lost. Things just get turned upside down, All the lines get crisscrossed. Those days when you feel, Totally out of control. When nothing makes sense, And your not completely whole. You don’t know why, You feel the way you do. You constantly wonder, But don’t have a clue. Everyone seems fine yet, You feel so confused. You feel mislead, Ignored and abused. You cant control these feelings, Or make them go away. We all have to deal, With our not so great days!!

       Well if things didnt already suck, they're getting worse. Missy's mom hit a nurse and her mother-in-law today and instead of taking her to jail for assault, she got put into a mental hospital!!! I can't even think right now. My mind is so twisted. I need to be with Missy, she's my bestest friend in the whole world and I'm not there for her!!!!!! I don't know what to do but I know I have to be there for her. I'm going to the hospital soon when my sister comes and gets me, Sandra's coming too. This shit is just SO crazy! I mean, come on, these things aren't supposed happen. I'm like in a frenzy right now!!! Well I'm going to go. Later! ~*CaSeY*~

       Lately I've been hurting   Bruised, torn, and tattered   And it seems like I've lost    Everything to me that mattered   Friendships have been broken   Theyre derailed and off track   Things have been said and done   Things that cant be taken back   Events have happened   Causing people to change   When you look at your friend   Theyre suddenly estranged   Its like you dont know   Who they are anymore   You see a whole new person   Who wasnt there before   Some might think thats a good thing   Some might think its bad   But when they change for the worse   You wish you could have what you had   You wish you had the power   To undo all that went wrong   You wish you had the strength   To fix things and be strong   But, what youll realize   What youll come to see   Is nothings ever perfect   Just plain reality

      Well its offical...summer is almost done, and school starts in a week. *tear* Well its not that bad I guess...its better than sitting at home bored. I still have to finish reading "A Tale of Two Cities" and lets just say, I'm not far at all...and its due the 1st day!!! (YIKES!!!) Well I'm going to get my license next week so that a plus. I'm excited, and supposably my dad is giving me the van to drive. I'm going to feel so ghetto driving to high school in a van, but oh well!!!!! hehe. I'm kinda excitied about going back to school and getting back into a schedule, and seeing everyone. High School is almost over and its kinda sad...:( These last 2 years are going to go by so fast, its freaky!!! I need to start preparing myself. But on to other news. I might go see Missy's dad tomorrow. I'm kinda scared, but I know I need to see him. That man is like a father to me, and I can't believe that he really had a stroke. Life is so unfair! But atleast he's alive. I praise God for that!!!! It's just a reality check because things are totally going to change now. Missy told me today, he was getting a hole in his throat like people get when they have emphysema, so he can breathe, eat and talk. And he's going to be in the hospital for 4-6 more months!!!!!!!!! But I gotta go. Later babes!!!!!! ~*CaSeY*~

       Well things have been okay recently. I've been hanging out with John and Janet and Jeremy for like the past 2 weeks straight. Missy I think, got a little upset about Janet and I becoming so close, but she's been with Damien the whole time anyway. John and I have been doing good, we've had some bumps and disagreements but its all good.I'm trying as hard as I can to keep him out of trouble. Well August 1st, the night of, Missy's dad (my dad pretty much) had a heart attack on his way to the store. He had open heart surgery yesterday, and as far as I know he's doing good. It was way scary yesterday. I thought it was really messed up because Missy and Dusty had their boyfriend (damien) and girlfriend (chrissy) over and a whole bunch of other people while there dad and family were at the hospital. And Dusty's selfish ass didnt care at all and all he wanted was pot. How dumb!!!!!!!!!! He's pisses me off. He has no feelings or concern about anyone else except himself. But I gotta go, put my clothes in the dryer. Laters!!!!!!!   ~*CaSeY*~
