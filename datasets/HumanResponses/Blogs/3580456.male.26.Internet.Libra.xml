      Reading through some posts of my younger friends...  It reminds me of how unaffected I am.  I suppose losing Steve is very difficult for her, more than I had imagined.  I'm glad her blog can say what I can't ask.  So I'm here expressing all these things - though no one will read it.  I think that's is partly the appeal of it all.  I can write and know that a random person may come and read about my life but never know who I really am.  But anonymous life make a very lonely life.  I wonder when the trend will end?  Everyone has a blog and lots of people read them.  Think every Microsoft employee has one.  I feel like I have to read it just to be on the cutting edge.  Though those blogs are really about technology and such and very little about the person, it's still an interesting read.  Hope my eyes don't fail me..

      Interview went well.. (at least in my mind!) I hope to be employed by a different company in about three weeks.  I still have to meet someone at the new company, per their policy, and negotiate a contract.  Working hard to finish up a project.  I'd want to leave my current job with a great feeling of accomplishment.  Which means I probably should get back to work instead of writing a blog.  But I think it's important to take breaks.  Otherwise, I just might become a computer.  Learning some funk.  I still like Chad Smith of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  He's got the funk.  urlLink On Drummer World  Driving that 16th note feel!

      Today will be the the release date of the web project I've been on for the last three/four months.  Steep learning curve as I had to learn html, javascript (somewhat), C#, ado.net, and asp.net.  I learned much and with this new found knowledge I'm out hunting for a new job.  We'll see come Wednesday 4:30 PM.

      June 12, 2004. Vehicle Accident.  Test driving with five people.  Driver loses control and hit a light pole.  Backseat passenger (a friend) gets hit on the head.  Pronounced dead at 7 something PM.  I went to the hospital around 9PM.  Everyone was crying.  Today is his funeral and I had to dry clean my black shirt since it was dirty.  Yeah, I wasn't all that close to him, afterall, I only knew him about six months.  I think most of my pain comes from seeing my other friends sad.  But we have hope in Christ.  I am a Christian and though I'm sad, I can have hope that I'll see him in heaven.

      so I'm at work.. though I'm clocked out.. (yeah I'm hourly.. what of it..) I feel obligated to finish something though usually I wait till tomorrow.. why this sudden desire to work more than the "paid" amount?&nbsp; it's my two-week's notice period..&nbsp; yes folks, that period where you're leaving but haven't left yet..&nbsp; the period where the boss plans to overwork you and such and such..  I was given more than TWO days of work..&nbsp; what to do..&nbsp; go home? write this blog? work? *sigh*..&nbsp; well I'm looking forward to the salary position..&nbsp; where at least I know I will be rewarded for my overtime..&nbsp; (maybe.. hehe)  guess I best finish this up so I can go home eventually..

      there is something satisfying about creation..&nbsp; the creative act that is..&nbsp; in an odd way, I liken programming to the same category.&nbsp; The feel of creating something from nothing is amazing.&nbsp; I'm sure God had fun making stuff.&nbsp; I know I enjoy it.  New Job.&nbsp; Starting August 23rd, 2004.&nbsp; Missions from Aug 8th - Aug 22nd.&nbsp; Move early Aug.&nbsp; Don't be lazy. =)Resignation is difficult to do.&nbsp; I actually have about two weeks, so I have to resign now.&nbsp; Don't be quiet.  Missions preparations are going well.&nbsp; We have training tonight.&nbsp; After a long days work too.&nbsp; Don't be tired.  Drumming is funny.&nbsp; My diddles are not as good as they used to be.&nbsp; My right hand is a bit crushed and I seem to tire out a bit early.&nbsp; I think more practice is the order of the day.&nbsp; Also work on my timing ~ metronome here I come.

      got back from vegas last week and I must admit I enjoyed it throughly.  I loved spending time with old friends.  I'm proud to say that I am close with my high school friends!  I've known most of those guys since freshman/sophomore year!  That's about ten years!  I suppose it's time for people to marry. ;)  Now that we've matured a bit, we actually discussed getting in to business together.  We have four interested parties (one car load actually) that are willing to chip in a decent amount and get in to something together.  I never thought myself the entrepreneur, but hey, more odd things have happened.  Though this week has been busy thinking and planning and such, I really like the idea.  I just hope I'm not playing with friendships.  Like I said, I've known these guys ten years.  I'll manage without money, I trust God to provide all that I need.  But friendship...  I'm not sure I want to gamble with that.  Well just a passing thought.  I hope the business venture will succeed that we will get closer instead.  There is always that chance! The business is not a get rich scheme so there is minimal risk.  It's more of a long term investment.    Well enough of that.  Interview.  City of Los Angeles.  Interview 4.  Purpose Driven Ministries.  We'll see next week whether I have a new job!

      I suppose it's a fad.. but on the other hand..  it seems like an extension of the ol' journal.  Public viewing is the real difference I suppose.  I went out with a friend to the fair last friday and she talked about how she kept a diary from 2nd grade.  Though she admits that the diary mostly contains negative things.  Apparantly, she doesn't like writing when happy.  Or it could be that she is a very very sad person. ;)  now back to the blog..  is it an intrusion? for some reason I feel like I'm intruding on someone's privacy..  or maybe it's the long tuned thought that diaries are personal.  Would I be offended at a friend who finds this and reads it?  If so, why would I post?  Many people at my church have blogs and some are QUITE expressive which is refreshing to hear.  It's funny that social pressures prevent people from being their most open self.  Though I wouldn't want people to cuss at me or punch me at the first sign of anger.  I like order for the most part. But I do find that there is much social pressure to be polite, nice, gentle, kind, etc.. etc..  Granted I'm looking a bit more narrowly at the corean (yes, with a 'c') christian culture.  last week of work at marric..  it's been a great time of learning and such, but time to grow up and grow out!  I'm getting older now and the burden of responsibility sits with me.  It's a good thing and yet a thing of stress and worry.  A bit about corean culture:  The eldest son takes care of the parents.  Think of it as a 401k or a retirement fund.  Honestly.   Now.. I'm the second son.  Never grew up with the burden or even the thought of taking care of my parents.  Of course, I would visit them and gift them whenever possible.. but  taking care of  my parents is a whole new ball game.  My older brother (step) lives in corea.  I live in the good ol' US of A.  Vive La USA.  So the bipartisan politics begin.  All in all, I feel the responsibility of taking care of my folks.  It's new and it was hard at first not being able to do the things you want to do.. but that's life.  I think life would be less exciting if you could do everything you wanted.
