      So...I didn't lose any weight last week. This is not surprising, being that&nbsp;I had the most bizarre cravings, and thus binged a few times. I didn't gain weight, so I'm not going to complain too much...So still...we're at 233. I dunno what the hell is wrong with me, but I'm actually going to call a doctor. I've got to be hella sick or feel really damn bad to even consider such a thing. But I hurt, I've been up all night, and the shit has got to stop. Drugs...that's what I need.  Bucky. Hehe, what can I say besides that? I absolutely cannot believe the whirlwind of feeling and emotion that has come to me as a result of him. Last weekend was so, so wonderful. I miss him so much. I never, ever intended to fall in love or to let emotion get involved. I mean, how taboo is it to see a married man? However, when the said couple is poly....I mean, why not? He says he can love me and love Megan too, and that he isn't going anywhere. So I'm just going to have fun, enjoy the ride for as long as it lasts, and hopefully, learn from the experiences. Regardless, I love him. It's been a long time since I felt love for a man. It's hard to admit to myself, but I do want him, and to a certain extent, maybe I even think that I need him. There is some connection there that I can't put my finger on. I've no idea what it is...maybe a past life or something.  Anyway, onto the doctor callings I go.

       So this is a good idea. There is so much going on in my life...yes, a way to keep track of it is good. Maybe I'll get motivated...we'll see .        &nbsp;   So let's start with "The Diet"...    &nbsp;I started about 6 weeks ago. (I think, I can't remember really.) The start weight was 255, and I made a goal of losing 100 pounds. Ok, so we'll count this as week Six......down to 233. Total lost: 22 pounds.
