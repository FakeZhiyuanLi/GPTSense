      yea...so i have the whole 'live journal' dealio but its getting on my nerves because i dont really say anything important in it, nor do i rant and moan about certain aspects of my life. this bothers me....so this is most likely where i will come to bitch and complain about things. yay for me. yes, i will also fill you in on what i have been doing in my pathetic life...if u care. so today was completely wasted....i swear to god. i just sat around all day, wondering if i should call people...kirstin, marley, ana, david, michelle.......i was like, yea i definitly need to call these people and then i didn't. why? i have no clue. im not one for calling people..i mean, the phone is like, my bestest friend but its usually people who call me not the other way around. whatever. so i was gonna call david like, three times but each time i changed my mind. he was taking his permit test today i think...so i was like, yea, he wont be there and blah blah blah. i really didn't want to talk to anyone today anyway. so i chilled in my room for a looong time.  i feel like im totally wasting the summer away....i haven't been chilling with friends as much as id like. im always having to go do things like softball, babysitting, dentist stuff......god. i haven't seen kirstin..my absolute best friend in the whole world in three weeks.....i haven't seen david in two weeks. i really really really want...no, NEED to talk to david. seriously....there are sooooo many things i want to tell him. lately i kind of wonder if he feels the same way he did when we were first together. he was banned from AIM which SUX major ass because thats how we did all our communicating and now he's never on. i told him to call me and he hasn't. he said he doesn't 'call people' wellll.....i was like you can't even call your girlfriend? on the other hand...why the hell don't i call him?????????????? what is wrong with me....im so fucking hypocritical. god.......i have never ever felt this way about anyone in my entire life. he makes everything so much better in my life...... so yea, i just want to spend some time just hanging out with him.....i really need someone to talk to and he's the only person im comfortable sharing certain things with. i miss my old 'freshie buddies' like zeke and kyle and charlie. hehehe...those guys are so cool. i have charlies SN.....i just realized that cuz i was reading my yearbook and i came across his phone number and sn. i hope he gets on soon...he usually succeeds in making me laugh. thats a good thing.  ok...this is getting to be long....im off to quizilla.com for some fun times!!!! yay
