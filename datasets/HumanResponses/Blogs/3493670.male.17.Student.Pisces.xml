        In a world where Gucci heels and Prada bags are considered dire necessities, diamonds are every girl's best friend and formerly for-men-only techie gadgets have evolved ito ultimate fashionista accessories, the 'material girl' phenomenon is anything but surprising. In fact it has become such a universal trush that it might as well have been predicted by Nostradamus. In the 80s, Madonna sang about being one. These days, virtually everyone is one.   From a philosophical context, materialism deems physical metter as the only ultimate reality. From a fashionista perspective, it refers to an irresistible and irrepressible urge to own things that have zero affordability points. From a relationship context, it simply reads: gold-digger.   I recently had dinner with a bunch of friends from high school, most of whom I hadn't seen or shared a real conversationwith in a while. Much to my astonishment, one of them is dating a guy 13 years her senior. I'm not against dating older men. I'm actually a firm believer in the "age/height/weight doesn't matter" aphorism of love. I am, however, against her dating him for "practical" reasons. Translation: He's filthy rich and can buy her everything her materialistic little heart desires--and more. I was flabbergasted! After the cat returned my tongue, I was able to digest her remark. I asked if she loved him. Her blase response? No, but I think i can learn to.   The worst part of it was half the table actually agreed with her. She explained that she couldn't possibly be with someone who--gasp!--couldn't afford to buy her expensive jewelry or take her on fancy trips abroad. I honestly felt, at that moment, that she and some of my friends had crossed from being shallow to being much, much worse.   I can't help but wonder, is that what she dreamed of when she was little? Is this what she waited for all her life?   I'll admit, I'm a material boy myself. I can be often found oohing and aahing at the fingerprint-free glass counter of Rustan's. I love my Neiman Marcus sweater to distraction and I'm often found prowling the mall. I cannot live without expensive restos to match my swanky tastebuds. I must religiously slather on a ludicrously expensive night cream, if only to ensure that I will indeed get my beauty sleep every night. I dream of someday owning a private yacht that I can sail to my own tropical island. I buy stuff I don't need regardless of wether or not my mom's credit card is already maxed out--all this to satiate my insatiable materialistic urges.   But I don't and won't choose my partner based on the size of their bank account. I refuse to stoop to that level of superficiality. Even I, with my Neiman Marcus sweater and night cream, have my limits. I will crawl down the isle covered in grease and clad in tattered clothing to marry the man I love. And although I admit its nice to be with a man who can buy me the world, If he can't, I'd love him just the same.   The truth is, I know in my heart that while I am still something sans the material extravagances, without love, I am nothing. The smug gratification from the purchase of a Neiman Marcus sweater could never compare to the divine ecstasy felt from the miracle of a first kiss. The fulfillment these pricey indulgences give is about as fleeting as the moment the last dollop of night cream is consumed, but the fulfillment of finding your one true love ensures a lifetime and beyond. Love is something that never runs out, loses worth, or goes out of style. It is something that gives you that indescribably tingly, happy, heavenly feeling that no amount of money can buy. It does not come in a fancy box, a classy bottle, or a glitzy platinum setting like all the other imperfect tangible treasures. Rather, love is packaged as it is, devoid of a price tag, as the most perfect intangible treasure in this world.   I will love for love, and marry for love. In an age where material girls and boys are a dime a dozen, I choose to be an Immaterial boy.

          Woke up at 10am. I ransacked my closet for something great to wear. Knowing that I will have a long and full day, I wanted to be relaxed so I opted to wear my red Oxygen shirt with my gray Nautica Clamdiggers and my trusty sandals. I went to my house in Makati to visit my mom first.      11:00am, when I reached my house in Makati, my mom emerged from the shower and told me that she wants to go shopping! Yey! So we went to glorietta to go shopping. We had brunch at French Baker Landmark branch and the food was great! After having brunch and a good conversation with my mom, I was starting to be really happy.      Not forgetting that I still have to meet Felix at 1pm, I decided to haul my ass along with my mom to the stores of Landmark to buy her stuff. She bought her stuff while I was standing around texting my Ate Barbie. Aware of the fact that shopping could take quite some time, I texted Felix and told him that I was gonna be late and wait for my text. I never thought shopping for clothes could take so long! And before I knew it, It was already 03:30! I was mortified! And as I watched my mom take the cab home and I found out that am fresh out of prepaid credits, I frantically ran to the nearest phone booth to call him up and uh oh! He sounds pretty pissed...      Must admit I was pretty nervous to hear his voice. I ran from glorietta to Mercury drug park square to buy some stuff and headed to the MRT Ayala station.      As I boarded the overloaded MRT car, I had no thought in mind but him. Was he mad? What am I gonna do? What Am I gonna say? I could hear my heart beating and my knees were growing weaker but I was standing up and I was drenched in sweat. And before I knew it, I was getting off at GMA Kamuning station.      I re-applied perfume and popped some breath mints while walking my way to Red Ribbons Kamias branch. Upon reaching Red Ribbons, my heart stopped. The noise around me suddenly stopped. I could hear my heart beating again. I was surrounded by silence despite the noises around me. There he was, in his gray shirt, looking disturbingly good! I entered the place and said hello. I apologized profusely because I was late and must admit it was partly my fault. He told me that he was having a headache. We decided to go somewhere private where we can be alone. We were lying in bed and I was just staring at him and I realized, we belong together. We like each other, we're crazy about each other and most of all we were in love. And I believe love will suffice.     When it was 11pm, we decided to hit the road and go to glorietta to have dinner in World Chicken but unfortunately, when we reached the place, World Chicken was closed already so we opted to have dinner at Wendy's. After the dinner, we talked a little and went down to go home. We smoked cigs while walking around glorietta. We both know its getting late yet I still wanted to stay longer, I opted to compromise. It was already almost 1am and he has to go all the back to kamias where he lives. He opted to see me off and I texted him when I got home.     It was nice. It was fun. It was sheer bliss...

          I got to thinking about relationships and stock market. Stock market fluctuates and relationships do crumble. But the question remains, why keep investing?

          Last night, Love infiltrated my system, engulfed my being and swallowed me whole. I lose all sense of time when I am with you. For me, everything stops when I'm around you. I couldn't feel the hours ticking away when we're together. I'm crazy about you. I love you and I want to be with you.

      I was listening to the song so I decided to put it in my blog. hehehe! wala lang.  Im so tired of being here. Supressed by all of my childish fears. But if you have to leave. I wish that you would just leave. Because your presence still lingers here. And it won't leave me alone.  These wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real. There's just too much that time cannot erase. When you cry, I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you scream, I'd fight away all of your fears. I held your hand through all of these years. And you still have...  All of me.  You used to captivate me by your resonating light. And now i'm bound by the life you left behind. Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams. Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me.  This wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real. There's just too much that time cannot erase. When you cry, I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you scream, I'd fight away all of your fears. I held your hand through all of these years. And you still have... All of me.  I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone. But though you're still with me. I've been alone all along.  When you cry, I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you scream, I'd fight away all of your fears. I held your hand through all of these years. And you still have... All of me.

          Think of me singing this when you're feeling down and you start to lose hope and all you want to do is collapse. Think of me. Think of me.   I've got to save my baby. Because he makes me cry. I've got to make him happy. I've got to teach him how to fly. I want to take him higher. Way up like a bird in the sky. I want to calm him down now. I want to save his life.  And I know that Love will change us forever. And I know that Love will keep us together. And I know, I know, there is nothing to fear. And I know that Love will take us away from here.  Sometimes its such a pleasure. Sometimes I wanna tear it all down. Its easy to be lazy. And hard to go away from the crowd.  I know the road looks lonely. But that's just Satan's game. And either way my baby. Will never be the same.  And I know that Love will change us forever. And I know that Love will keep us together. And I know, I know , there is nothing to fear. And I know that Love will take us away from here.  In a blink of an eye everything could change. Say hello to your life, now you're living. This is it. From now on, its a brand new day. It was time to wake up from this dream [from this dream].  I know the road looks lonely. But that's just Satan's game. And either way my baby. Will never be the same.  And I know [And I know] that love [that love] will change us forever And I know [And I know] that love [that love] Will keep [that love] us together [that love]  And I know [And I know] that love [that love] will change us forever And I know [And I know] that love [that love] will keep us together And I know [And I know], I know [I know] there is nothing to fear And I know [And I know] that love [that love] will take us away from here

          I am sorry that my boyfriend broke up with you. I am also sorry that you felt the need to let everyone know what happened and as a result, they hated him without hearing his side. I am sorry that you felt the need to apologize to him after bashing and slandering him on the net for everyone to see.      But I am not sorry for hating you. Hating you with a passion that yes, if I do see you, I will hit you with a fucking sledge hammer with such delight that I will make Clint Eastwood look like a girl scout reject. I am not sorry that I am writing this letter. I am this mad for what happened to my boyfriend and I believe no amount of apology from you can make him forgive you. Suffice to say, you sealed your own coffin. You once had my sympathy, now, you have nothing but my hatred.

          Break ups. This is the dreaded phase in relationships. Where both parties or at least of them decides to end it.      Break ups are awful. And they're private. And they're not necessarily symptomatic of what two people had together. There are two sides in a break up and the stories both parties may share. Sometimes, I wanna remind people never to take sides nor judge the other person involved simply because they don't know the other person's side.       I am writing this journal for a special someone who was trashed, slandered and insulted on the net by a bitter ex girlfriend who wrote a journal about their break up. Suffice to say, I am hurt for this person because none of the people who read the journal listened or at least attempted to ask him for his side of the story. These fucking idiots were so moved by the other person's journal that they simply started taking sides in a snap. They were giving out snide comments like "he aint worth it", "He's an asshole", and all that crap. And what disappoints me the most is that, some of them have never been into a relationship to give out comments like that. I'm not saying that I am an expert in relationships but I have enough guts to actually say that it is none of their concern. This break up is about two people and no one else should be involved.      I wanna write more about this journal but I am way too pissed to even continue. Am gonna go punch a wall muna.

      I'm going to make a list of&nbsp;songs that must never be heard again!   1.) My Heart Will Go On by&nbsp;Celine Dion.&nbsp;OST Titanic. Circa 1997.   This is the most awful song there is! And its awfulness was intensified exponentially due to overplaying. And creative DJ's actually made remixes and added excerpts from the movie itself (Jaaaaccckkk! Rooooossssssee!).&nbsp;&nbsp;This song is actually the equivalent of 2 caesarians and a lobotomy.   2.) Horny. Circa 1999.   Sex in music is definitely overrated. There is such a thing as erotic music that actually stimulates lust and is perfect for making out. But this song actually makes my libido shrivel up and die. I mean the song goes like  I'm horny! Horny Horny Horny! ( repeat 2000 times). I gotta hand it to her. She's actually got a tiny vocabulary and to make matters worse, I would hear kids particularly in elementary singing the song. The closet moralist in me is actually cringing at the memory of kids singing it.   3.) Hot In Herre by Nelly. Circa 2002.   Back to the subject of sex in music. This is actually one of the songs that made me shake my head in total disgust. Don't get me wrong, I'm not totally a closet moralist. The song is crass and it has no taste. It goes like  its getting hot in herre so take off your clothes.  And a line that has something to do with a pole in the basement. I'm shaking my head in complete and utter disgust because Nelly is butt ugly. Damn I would look a thousand times better even after a bar brawl and a lobotomy.   4.) My Way by Frank Sinatra. Circa God knows when.   This song has actually killed people. Armed drunken fucks have been shooting people who's been singing the song. It turns drunkards homicidal and turns&nbsp;pets like dogs into&nbsp;mean&nbsp;killing machines!&nbsp;might I add this teeny tiny info. When I was younger, I could remember my Uncle Delfin singing My Way and actually heard dogs barking while he was singing. It got me thinking, were the dogs hungry or were they just simply going homicidal? Maybe its animal cruelty.   Since I'm pretty drained and tired, I'm gonna make this a two parter. Hehehe! This is me trying to humor myself after a painful introspection.

      *Twisting and turning last night while trying to sleep*   Stared at myself in the mirror and had to employ every ounce of self-control to stop me from punching the mirror.   &nbsp;  Woke up at 8:33 am. My diva of a dog named BB has been barking nonstop and my mom woke me up to&nbsp;put her on a leash. Suddenly, I got to thinking about the true meaning of Diva. The word has been devalued of its meaning because of rampant misuse. Its has been synonymous to the other overused word, Bitch.   I stared at myself in the mirror and looked at myself wondering what I have become, I've been asking myself lots of questions lately. Am I misunderstood or are they the one misunderstood by me. Are we both wrong? Or Am I just wrong but I simply refuse to concede defeat? Or are we both wrong but they don't concede defeat because they're older?&nbsp;*closes eyes for a sec to think* I wouldn't really know where to start. Sometimes, when I look at myself in the mirror, I actually led myself to believe that I'd see someone worthwhile. But now, I was wrong. I see nothing. Nothing.   Once again I asked myself if I am bad. I can't even come up with an answer. Am I naturally bad? Because there is such a thing as naturally bastardly. Maybe thats me. Maybe I just need some time to find myself once again. How many times does one person actually have to find himself? But one thing's for sure. I am so sick of having to explain and justify my actions and actually getting my point across.  Pagod na ko  (I'm tired of doing that). But on view of what just happened recently, maybe its better to just ignore them. But then again, as you shut up an reach the end of your patience, you lash out. But lashing out all the time is actually worse.   I got to thinking about Respect. Is it something that you must command? Or is it something that you actually have to earn? My brain aint functioning properly so I can't come up with an answer to that. Or maybe there's no precise answer to that because they can both be right. Both has it share of pros and cons. *grips&nbsp;hair in utter irritation*   The minute I get the answers to my questions, I'll let you know.

      *Stares at himself in the mirror*   After a long time of being able to stare&nbsp;at the mirror, I found myself not wanting to see the person staring back at me   My God. I  am  fucked up.   Contrary to popular belief, I don't write in my blog to update people about the things going on in my life. I write for myself and I find blogging cathartic. Its like my release. When walls are not available to punch, there comes the blog. ^_^   As I tried to sleep last night, I got to thinking about myself. Why did I let this happen? Why the fuck must it go this far to realize our priorities? Why do we keep procrastinating? What the fuck is wrong with you Matt?!?! Dammit! This is your fault. You know it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do problems arise one after the other? Sometimes, the other problem hasn't been solved, then comes another one. Give us a break please!   Allow me to explain&nbsp; further.   I had a so-so day as usual. Promised myself to do my assignments but my laziness got the better of me and I&nbsp;watched Frida for the nth time. I had to go to Greenbelt 3 to meet Athan and his friend cuz I promised to lend him&nbsp;TheOne's qaf CDs. I went to surplus shop to buy A tan suede zip up jacket but ended up having it reserved so I can have more choices. I made friends with the surplus shop manager, Chona. As I went down to the grocery store to stock up my ref again. I decided to go home. I played with BB and waited for&nbsp;TheOne to call.   As I txted&nbsp;TheOne to say&nbsp;hi, my phone rang. It was him. We were talking about each other's day and everything was going great. Then out of nowhere, he told me that his&nbsp;mom asked if I am his boyfriend. I froze. I panicked and suddenly, I felt derailed. Derailed from the tracks of a happy&nbsp;week.&nbsp;But I managed to ask him about his response, He said he simply smiled and left. We also talked about&nbsp;our paperwork. We haven't done that much.&nbsp;And&nbsp;it is my fault for&nbsp;staying on the phone for long. He confessed that&nbsp;he'd rather make me go to UP instead of talking at night&nbsp;cuz nighttime is the time that he &nbsp;studies and&nbsp;nighttime is also that time that I study. And talking on the phone occupies the hours that should be spent studying. I should've known better. I must admit he is right. And what we talked about&nbsp;triggered my resolve to exercise further self control.   I love you TheOne. We can do this.&nbsp;We'll support each other and hold each other's hand through all this. Let's just learn from what's happening. And I am sorry that&nbsp;it had to go this far for me to realize it.   I love you and I always will.

      Tips I've learned and I want to share them to couples out there.  ANNIVERSARIES and MONTHSARIES Always celebrate anniversaries. Whether its the first or the 50th, each year together is a triumph.  APPRECIATION Let him know how much you love and appreciate him once in a while. He may know it already but hearing it from you is always better.  Butter him up once in a while. Guys like to be reminded of their strong points.  BEST FRIENDS Make sure he's your best friend before you think of getting engaged. The strong bond of friendship will help you through tough times.  Be best friends, preferably even before being boyfriend-girlfriend. Take time to know each other so the relationship is a deep one. Tell him about your crushes, your dreams, your problems. Cry to him if you're going through a personal crisis. You'll be surprised how good his advice can be.  BOND Make it a point to spend time together often, but leave enough room so he doesn't feel smothered.  Spend time alone with each other. Individuals can be involved separately in their own projects or careers and at the end of the day they share their experiences.  CHANGING EACH OTHER Don't marry an asshole. Once a jerk, always a jerk. You'll never change him. Really wait for the right guy.  Don't get married thinknig he'll change for you. Its unfair to get involved with someone when you're thinking of doing an overhaul on them.  COMPLIMENTS always compliment each other. This will prevent feelings of resentment and thinking that one is being taken for granted.  DATE Keep doing things that you both enjoy, and do them together. Watching movies, playing badminton, people watching, reading and more. When you do things together and when these are things you both enjoy, how can you not have a wonderful relationship? Take note, this doesn't mean you have to do everything together. Shared pleasures is just one of those things that most couples forget.  Make time and continue to date to keep the romance. Look good, smell good to maintain the physical attraction.  DIFFERENCES Celebrate your differences (personality, upbringing, religion, mental ability, earning capacity, etc). Never force your ideologies down his throat, or vice versa. You both need to retain your individuality.  Give up trying to turn your partner into you. Accept your differences and learn to appreciate them.  FIGHTS Fight with the aim to resolve the issue. Don't endlessly go on trying to outdo each other. The longer you extend the fight, the more chances you'll say something hurtful that you don't really mean.  The world will not end if you both go to bed mad at each other. Forget what your mom or parish priest says. Trying to resolve big fights late at night is impossible, especially if you both have to go to school or work the next morning. In fact, sometimes an uncomfortable night of madness is just what you need so you see things clearly. As mad as you were last night, this is still the guy who laughs at your jokes and thinks you're hot, despite all the petty fags who go by. Go to bed mad at each other, and you will wake up feeling more strongly that you want to make up.  Respect and trust each other. Even when having an all-out brawl, be careful not to cross the line with your partner. Or if you do, take a deep breath, suck it in, and apologize (but never get physical).  When you fight, hear each other out but don't dig up old issues.  Be careful what you say in a fight. You cannot take back hurtful, insulting words.  Choose your battles: Make sure the fight will be worth it and that something will change in the relationship as a result of the fight.  Don't be afraid to talk, discuss, argue.  FLAWS Know the perfect guy does not exist (thank God I found someone pretty damn close). The sooner you realize this, the easier your relationship will be. Know that just as there are things that you love about him, there will be things that will drive you crazy. No matter who you're with, there will always be something. Just like you, he's only human with his own flaws and foibles. Lighten up and enjoy life. Try to shrug off the petty annoyances. In the long run of life, they don't matter a bit.  FUN Have fun together! If you're going to be stuck in each other's company for the rest of your lives, the least you should do is enjoy your time together. This means keeping the fun and spontaneity that was there in the early days. Driving out for midnight snacks when the craving hits, talking till morning (even on a school day), running off on impromptu trips, having monday morning errand and breakfast days... whatever strikes your fancy. Nothing kills the fun faster than too much planning and too much scheduling. Ugh!  Allow yourselves to get silly. Shower together, pee with the door open, wear your ugly undies. The more barries you break physically, the more you break emotionally.  Enjoy being silly. Being able to make each other laugh and see the lighter, crazier absurd side of life is the best way to get through all the differences in personalities, adjustments in lifetyles and opposing viewpoints that exist in all relationships. Plus there's added bonus of keeping a happier perspective on things!  GOALS Make sure you have similar goals as a team. It would be difficult to keep your bond intact of your views are complete opposites.  GRUDGES Quit tabulating grudges. Le off steam when something's pissing you off, discuss it, then trash it. Dnot recycle it.  KEEPING IT HOT Keep it hot by travelling to different places together. A new setting can do wonders.  KISSING Make time for a real kiss at least once a day (and go wherever that takes you). I'm not talking about perfunctory pecks. I'm talking about taking a deep breath and just kissing him, at least once a day. At bedtime if you like, or before you each go to school or work. If the mood escalates, you can go with the flow, but you don't have to. Just kissing is intimate, romantic and relationship-strengthening in a very special way.  KNOW EACH OTHER Learn about each other's interest. Be it cars, fashion, art, gadgets, books, music, sports, etc. It truly keeps the conversation flowing!  HONESTY Don't lie or hide things. The problem will only get bigger.  HUG A hug can be far more intimate than a kiss.  IDENTITY Don't lose your personality. Thats why he fell in love with you!  Don't lose your identity. Work, study, hang out with your own friends.  Have separate interests and activities to keep your individuality; and to be able to contribute more to the relationship.  INTENTIONS Wish each other well. Some couples, when they begin to dislike each other, they wish each other the worst! This is rather stupid. His success is yours and vice versa.  ISSUES Speak up about the awkward stuff now, like money and sex. The earlier, the better.  LISTEN When he talks to you about his problems, don't be too eager to solve them. Just make it a point to listen.  Listen, listen, listen. Hear each other out, especially during arguments. This will also keep you from saying hurtful words. Its not about getting your point across, its about comprehending each other's feelings.  LOOK GOOD Exercise together. It doesn't have to be three times a week or anything like that. Maybe you could have a gym date instead of a dinner date. Or jogging around sanlo park or have sex. Whatever it is, it has to be physical and at least once a week. When you keep in tune with your own body, its easier to tune into each other's bodies.  Mind your appearance! Stay fit and healthy for each other.  LOVE It all boils down to your love, chemistry, and respect for each other. Your relationship can't really be planned or strategized. There are no fail-safe solutions or advice. MOTHERING Never mother him. Be his partner, not his mother!  MIND-READING No matter how long you've been together, the Golden Rule is: Do not think he can read your mind the way you can read his.  NEEDS Remeber to be good to yourself, then be good to him. That's what love is about, after all. Will this make him happy? Will this make him sad? Will he enjoy this? Consider his feelings. This doesn't mean you should forget about yourself. But he should be right up there too.  Be very attentive to his needs, that way he learns to do the same for you.  Be sensitive to his needs, physically and of course emotionally.  PRIORITIES If one says its important, then it is!  Prioritize each other over friends, extended family, or work.  PRIVACY Have personal space. Allow each other a private moment or two as needed.  RESPECT Create a strong sense of respect for him and yourself. That way you will always treat each other well. That should never change from Day One.  RIGHT REASONS TO BE TOGETHER If you can picture yourself growing old with him, then he's The One!  You can't bear being apart from each other. You want to grow old together, have children, and be the best you can be for each other/ You want to make short and long term goals togetherm or you want to fulfill each other's dreams or just make each other happy!  SELF-ESTEEM Work on your self esteem. If if you're ok with yourself, you will deem your partner as ok too and that improves the relationship. When you bring  whole person to the relationship, you have more to give and have less emotional needs.  SEX Be sexually adventurous. Make each other feel comfortable sharing your sexual fantasies and frustrations.  Lots and lots of sex! Being physical really keeps couples interested in each other. Make an effort all the time!  SPACE Give each other space. Even couples who seemed joined at the hip need theit time to themselves. Have dates with your friends and give him is dates with his friends as well. If you can't trust each other with this, don't be together.  SORRY Be able to say sorry when you're wrong.  SURPRISES No matter how long you've known each other, be open to surprises, both good and bad!  TALK Communicate through dialogue. This is an essential ingredient in successful, long relationships. Goos communication is almost a science as entire seminars have been devoted to this topic. Dialogue lets you tackle issures by sharing your feelings without judgments or criticism, active listening, then working up to a discussion for problem solving. Its not easy. It takes continuous effort and learning.  Tell each other stories. Life goes by pretty fat, and it's easy to see how easily couples can grow apart. Whenever something funny, scary, exciting, or juicy happens to you or someone you know, tell him about it. And have him do the same. Keep each other in the loop of life, even by e-mail or phone talk if you have to.  TEAMWORK Think for two and work as a team. Consult each other before making big decisions because everything will always affect the both of you.  Strengthen couple power. In many cases, we have to decide based on what is best for the relationship in favor of our individual selves. No need to fear losing out individuality when we do this if our self-esteem is intact.

      *Exhales*  *Malaguena Salerosa playing on the background*  Peloy, as I closed my eyes to sleep last night, I want you to know that you don't have to worry about time. You need it in order to finish your thesis. If you'd keep worrying about us, you'll never finish your thesis on time. This can't always be about us. This is now about you. The "ME" time you deserve. Quit worrying about me and people around you because that will never solve your thesis problems.  I can't speak for everybody. I can only speak for myself. First and foremost, I know how important your thesis is to you. So I am giving you the time and please take it without the slightest tinge of guilt. Be comforted by the fact that I understand it and yes, I'm giving it to you. you have my full support and you don't have to worry about anything ^_^

      "Disclaimer" I am currently on acid so please bear with me. This is truly and utterly non-sequitur. All in the name of my dear friend Kendra.    I have a dear friend named Kendra who apparently believes in immortality. Immortality: A belief that you can live forever, physically or otherwise. Immortality can be achieved by being an icon, a hero, heck! Even a pornstar! But this particular immortality I am talking about is The Immortality of Chickens.  Perhaps an explanation is in order.      Chickens, like humans have their purpose on earth. However, chickens are food and they are eventually reduced to human poop. But Kendra The Chicken believes in immortality. She wants to be an icon, one way or another. She wants to leave a dent in this world. Maybe as the chicken who worked for an internet cafe. Maybe as the chicken who one-wayed a gorgeous guy because her "chickeness" got the better of her, or maybe she wants to be the first chicken to be a dominatrix in high heels.      She abhors the movie Chicken Run primarily because the movie revolves around chickens running for their lives. This particular chicken who is the precise equivalent of the Virgin Mary professes a moral discomfort with the murders of poor chickens everywhere. She bitches about the fact that dismembered chicken limbs are sold freely in the goddamn supermarket. "Thats just obscene!" She said. She was on the verge of going homicidal and she wanted to snatch the butcher's knife and dismember his penis.  Now, basking in the spotlight is my very dear friend Kendra, who believes in chicken rights and chicken immortality.

          These are uneasy times for heterosexual women. We are bio-engineered to produce offspring and ensure the survival of the human species, but when we survey potential DNA donors, we suspect its time to chlorinate the gene pool. I remember something I heard in an otherwise idiotic movie: Guys are like parking spaces. All the good ones are taken, and the available ones are handicapped.      Okay, not all men are dogs. There are a lot of great guys out there; unfortunately they're already taken. Women who take an ethical stand against poaching are at a disadvantage (see what good behavior gets you). Sometimes the most you can hope for is a trainable puppy, one that won't pee all over the house.     Occasionally you meet an apparently perfect specimen. He's smart, funny, attractive, sensitive, articulate, cultured, dresses well. He even cooks. The first question that pops into your head is not, "is he seeing anyone?" The first question is, "is he gay?" And if the answer to both questions is no, What is wrong with him?      The debate in homosexuality still rages. We're not sure whether the person is born gay or becomes gay, but it seems that there are more gay men today than in previous decades. The explanation could simply be that the population is bigger, so the number of gays is proportionately larger. It could be that since homosexuality is no longer classified as a disease, it is considerably less traumatic to come out of the closet, so it would appear that there are more gays in the present era. In any case, humans are an admirably adaptable group, and women are making adjustments. I see a trend in straight women-gay men relationships. It makes perfect sense. After all, empathy and shared interests are essential to relationships. Who would better understand your need to hand a Keanu Reeves poster in your room?      I have three flagrantly gay friends who are currently embroiled in relationships with women. Perhaps they were closet heterosexuals. Maybe these are tidings of the apocalypse. Much to everyone's consternation, they look happy. Don't knock happiness, it doesn't happen very often.      I have two theories on the apparent gay population explosion. One, Nature is addressing the problen of overpopulation on this planet by limiting the number of propagators. As far as I know, gay men cannot give birth, although if the straight women-gay men syndrome persists, this theory goes kaput. Two, the theory of natural selection tells us that individuals which adapt better to their environment tend to survive and perpetuate the species. This leads to genetic changes and eventually, to the origin of new species. Among humans, we look for partners with the qualities that will ensure the continuation of our lineage. With every generation we strive for improvement, and therefore greater survivability. But what happens when the line has fulfilled its potential and produced individuals as charming as their DNA can aspire for? At this point mixing chromosones with other individuals would not lead to further improvement. So the individuals become gay.      Yesterday, I heard another theory from my friend Greaser. It is in equal parts conspiracy theory, urban legend, and paranoid ranting. It involves "nutribuns."     In the 1970s, to promote better nutrition among schoolchildren, the government provided free nutrient enhanced bread called "nutribuns." According to Greaser, these buns did not just contain nutrients. They not only addressed the problem of malnutrition, but also the problem of rapid population growth. How?      "By making children gay," Greaser said, darkly.      "WHAT?"      "It was an experiment. European scientists used the buns to spread drugs that promote homosexuality," he said. "Homosexuality limits population growth. In the past, only upper-class people could come out of the closet. They could afford to flout convention. These days, people of all economic classes can come out of the closet. Many of these people ate nutribuns."      "You're a freak," I told him. "I ate nutribuns and I'm not gay."      "But you have many gay friends," he said. You are beyond fag hag. You are a haggot." He raised an eyebrow. I raised an eyebrow. I had the sudden urge to watch  Spartacus.

      *stares blankly at the screen*  This has been a peaceful morning for me. For the first time in a week, I was able to almost sleep properly. Its 1:30 pm. Maybe I should call it Peaceful Afternoon. Anyways, I did my paperwork till 3:30am. I am hell bent into making it to UP Diliman. I am making sure that my assignments and exams will be perfect to get the grades I need to get to UP.  I don't really have much to do today. I have a short list of my  must be done before the day ends.     1.) Must find a rare DVD for Peloy. 2.) Must find Lucky a nice gift too. 3.) Must find myself new jeans. 4.) Must find a gift for Dell. 5.) Must read The Idiots Guide to Labradors.  I have yet to finish my filipino assignments. I'm not even halfway done yet. The assignment is pretty long but its not intellectually straining except for some deep Tagalog words that I can't understand. Anyways, BB took a bath earlier! Yey! I can breathe a little easier. That's one responsibility that has been done for today.  *Stares blankly at the screen again*  Upon closer inspection, I have officially been a blog addict! Blogging is habit forming. Yet its fun and it improves your vocabulary. Hehehehe! I have yet to learn how to post pics to I can add images to my blog.

      Recently, I found myself being asked by people about the things I want. I couldn't give them a clear answer. Actually, all I tell them is I don't know. They would even ask me if I want to get married. One can only hope, I replied. Do I want to have kids? My mom would often ask. All I will say is, I don't know. Relatives would often bring up the subject of marriage and babies. They would sum up my life by saying,  sayang ka naman kung di ka magkakaanak!  I will just shake my head and smile politely.  Contrary to popular belief, I one had my dreams and ambitions. I wanted to be a lawyer, or a model or an actor. I wanted to be rich and have it all. But as I turned 17 I realized, its about time that silly ambitions such as these give way to reality.  Right now, what I want to do academically, is pass all my examinations in the homestudy program and have an 85% and up. I have two years to think of the course I'll be taking up in college. And in those two years, I have to pass all exams and I have to review for the UPCAT exams. I don't want to disappoint myself any further. Suffice to say, I am now DRIVEN. I am no longer ambitious. The term would be driven.  When it comes to the subject of vanity, what I want to do is improve my body. Go to the gym to shape up and have regular derma treatments to clarify my skin. Grow my hair long and have an extenso treatment from either Propaganda or Piandre salon. An extenso treatment is like hair rebonding, but safer. I wanna have more clothes. If I wouldn't be a model, I'd at least want to look like one and turn heads.  In my relationship, he is the one for me and I cant imagine life without him. We still have some barriers to break down but we will manage. I will settle down with him and him alone. Not everyone can understand why I am damn sure about this things cuz we've only been together for four months. My answer to them is, only I know when its right. When its right, you just know. And I don't just know, I am damn sure.  Career talk, I have yet to discover my future career. I guess that would depend on the course that I will be taking. Suffice to say, I don't have that in mind yet. I'm gonna have to make it to UP Diliman first before deciding.  Family Life. I love my family. We've been encountering problems recently but we've been patching things up. Details must remain undisclosed.

      *Smiling cuz of contentment*  I have submitted my first assignment and yes, I did well! I wasn't able to sleep much that night cuz I really had to study and am hell bent to study in UP come 2006. The day wasn't as easy as I imagined it to be.  *Closes eyes for a sec to remember*  I woke up at 7am. I was calling on my mom and asked her for a piece of gonuts donuts. I sorta need sweets in the morning to energize me but she said that there aint anymore donuts. Aaaaaarrrggghhh! So I just took a bath and realized that am fresh out of facial scrub. Oh no! But had no time to buy some cuz I gotta go to school. Had to dress up quickly cuz mom, lolo and my tita were waiting for me. When I was done, we hailed a cab cuz my lolo's having his monthly check up. It was traffic in c5 and I was beginning to lose my patience cuz I might not make it to school and my tita was betting like 500 bucks to prove that I wouldn't make it. *smells impending bomb*  Arrived at Shaw Boulevard at 10 am. Exams end at 12. I have two hours left to travel, study and take the exams. While I was in the FX, I was in a psuedo state of panic already. The driver drives like a snail.  As I reached my stop, I look at my cell to check the time. To my horror, it was already 11am! Waaaaahhh! I'm having this fear that I wouldn't make it. I had to run. As I reached the faculty room, I was praying that my teacher would let me take my exam.  She did.  I had like 15 mins to study. I was hoping not to fail. As I took the exam paper, my heart was pounding. I was scared. I nervously read the questions and to my delight, it aint really that hard. took the exams as fast as I can and left the school with the feeling of weight lifted off my shoulders.  I was waiting for the FX and I suddenly felt my hunger. My stomach was growling! I had half a mind to take the cab but I wouldn't have any money left if I will. So I opted to wait for an FX. 30 excruciating minutes later, an FX arrived. Lets not forget that the FX only reaches Shangri-La. Had to take the MRT to Ayala.  Called up The Grudge to ask her where they are. She said we're having lunch in Jollibee! Yey! I've been hankering for Jollibee's chicken for the past 3 days. As I reached Jollibee Glorietta 4, I faced my tita with a smug smile on my face. I told her that yes, I took the exams and passed it! She was rather speechless. She couldn't say anything. As I asked her for the 500 bet, she said nothing. Sorta saw that coming though.  It was already 2pm, I had to go to PSbank Arnaiz branch to get my mom's new checkbook. There's no jeep from Glorietta to PSbank Arnaiz, so I had to walk... again. As I reached PSbank, I asked Lisa Or Spencer about my mom's checkbook. They said that they couldn't give me the checkbook without an authorization letter from my mom. I called home and my mom spoke to the bank personnel, but they still need the goddamn authorization letter. So I had no choice but to go my house in Makati to get my mom to make an authorization letter. As the authorization letter was finished, she said something so shocking, it sent shivers down my spine. She invited Peloy to come over on the 17th! I was shocked! I bursted into tears! I was sooooo damn happy! I was at my wit's end and expending the remnants of my energy. But with that statement, I was re energized!  Had to run back to PSbank and slap those people with my authorization letter. As I received it, I had to run back home to give it to my mom. As I was making my way home, I was making a list of things I gotta buy before I head to UP Diliman. I gave the checkbook to my mom and kissed her goodbye.  As I hailed a jeepney to go to glorietta, I received a txt message coming from Peloy and he was pretty disappointed. And the cause was that Motherfucking UP @$$#0LE! I swear! If I can only kill without even the slightest tinge of guilt, I would've done it already (Imagines the cold and sharp blade of the samurai sword swiftly slicing UP @$$#0LE$' neck). So I went to SM makati to buy Massage oil, a chocolate bar and my bowtie *wink wink* and made my way to UP.  I boarded the MRT, I noticed a screaming fag in his 40's naughtily smiling at me. I showed him nothing but a sarcastic look at screams (leave me alone  punyeta!  I am not at all interested). As the MRT reached the ortigas station, I got pushed my a guy by accident and as a result, I dropped my phone and the housing cracked. Jesus Christ! Fortunately, Tim was txting me and keeping me company as I endure the excruciating trip from MRT Ayala station to Quezon Ave.  As I reached the Quezon Ave station, I asked for directions as to where I can find the UP Pantranco jeep. Someone was kind enough to take me there. I boarded the jeep and made my way to UP. I stopped at Sunken Garden. As I was walking across Sunken Garden, my shoes we're sinking in the puddle of mud and my slacks we're having mud stains already. Aaarrrggh! And then, I saw Peloy. I waved at him. He waved back. As I made my way up to see him, he was in his new shirt and all i could mentally say was *Yowza*! Hehehehe!  As I met Peloy, I txted Tim to say that I was already in Sunken Garden. He arrived in less than 3 minutes. Tim and Peloy we're talking about UP stuff. Suddenly, I was lost. Heyyyy! I'm not from UP guys! Well, at least not yet. Hehehe! Suddenly, Peloy mentioned the name of UP @$$#0LE again. It pisses me off! I really have nothing but sheer and utter contempt for that guy. I just wish that UP @$$#0LE will die before I even get to UP.  I gave Peloy the chocolate and gave him a back massage. Later, we were talking about how we fell in love with each other and how much we truly love each other. The comfort and security his presence brings is just overwhelming. Time stops when I am with him.  Later that night, we bought Chickenjoy in Jollibee Kamias and I made my way back to Glorietta by taking the bus.  As I reached glorietta, I asked my mom if we can go to McDonald's Greenbelt to buy food. I can't buy food anywhere cuz it's already 11pm. So we hailed a cab and ordered through drive thru. I had my buffalo chicken Mcdo. Its pretty good! I had to go home to eat it cuz it's drenched in sauce and eating it in the cab would be messy. I had my dinner at home and went online only to read Peloy's blog.  I had to go home cause I want to hear Peloy's voice before we both sleep. He called up to say goodnight and exchanged I love You's *Awwwwww* It still gives me the butterflies. I do love him that much.  Looking forward to more of this as time passes by.  I love you Peloy.
