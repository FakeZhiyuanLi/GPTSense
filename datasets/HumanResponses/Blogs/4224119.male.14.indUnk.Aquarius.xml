      Michal phelps. Most of you probably know him. He swam at  the olympics. He medaled seven times, tying the record. he could have broken it, but he gave up his spot for a   guy that probably won't be in the next olompics. I wan't any of my readers to comment  on this, if he did the right thing of not.

      MXC. the best game show ever. Indeed it is :-)   (if you watch the show you would get that last sentance)       I wan't to give my readers (if any) joy so if you have Spike TV you can watch it. just look at tv schedules on line. on the east coast it's usually on at aaround 5 o clock. (PM)

      You may think I am a geek. you may think I am immature. But I love DBZ. But what I love even more is a good spoof of DBZ. At acid-play.com, in the action sidebar there is a game called Lemming Ball Z (LBZ). LBZ is awsome. there is blood everywhere, but you can turn that off. other than that nothin else of objectionable

      My mom just got a new computer. so you know what that means? I get her old one. I am currently typing on it.  Her old computer is fine. It's from 1999, it has a bad battery and it's ALT key is missing and the "g" key does not work. Yay. *grumbles*  For all the "g"'s I have to copy and paste. that is really a pain.

      I collect hats. I have over 20 of them. Some of you might thinks that is really weird. Do any of you collect stamps. I tried. I had gotten oven thirty weeks of stamps when I realized "hey I'm going to have to put these somwhere" by that time I had over a hundered little peices of paper. To me sitting down and going throuh each one is really stupid. And weird. I'd rather collect things that I can actually use (like hats)

Most people think that homeschoolin is fun. Hey, you get up when you want do a little school and hang around all day with out chanin from you under wear. Let me et one thin straiht. THIS IS NOT HOW IT IS!!!!!!!! I get up at 7, I start school at 8, I et half an hour lunch and get out at 2:30, and have to go swimmin for TWO hours. by the time my mom picks me up (Because i cant drive yet; 1 year 5 months and 26 days to go!) late as usual by then it is five thirty and we eat dinner, I finish whatever school I have left, then it's 7 and we have "Family Time", which in m HO is a "Waste of Time". there. so screw yu school goers. >:-P
