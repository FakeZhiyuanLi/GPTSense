      1. How does the increasing use of cameras affect privacy?  it'll efect  peoples privacy because they dont want a camera in the shower! thats crazy! and if we're telling some important plan for the world and its caught on tape they'll be so sued!   2. Where do you think it is fair to have cameras installed? Not fair? its fair cause criminals can be caught on the tape and its not fair because no one can have any privacy  3. What is your opinion on this subject? my opinion on the cameras is that its alright to have them but its not alright to have more than 1000 camera in one state!  4. If you feel that this is an invasion of privacy, how do you feel governments should help increase protection from the inclining terrorist threats?  it is and if they have to do that..than its alright! but just put in polite places. not like in bathrooms and bedrooms! they can put it in hotels and places like the mall and cafes!

      1.Do you feel this would be something you would like to use? I would like to try this method, but i don't think you should carry all your info in your skin which can be known by just anyone in stores. 2. Do you think society is ready for technology like this? i think the society isn't that ready yet because there is still alot of people out there that wants to know other people's personal business.  3. What would be the benefits of this technology? Credit cards and bags and wallets would not get stolen and that the police could catch the criminal easily with other technological help. 4. What could become problems with this technology? Other people who does not care of people's privacy and want to get money will try to know lots of things of that particular person 5. What other thoughts or opinions do you have regarding this technology. Well, i saw this kind of similar method on discovery channel and it was pretty cool, they tried this method on a family and the police could trace them wherever they go but it isn't as private and comfortable so i guess i'd rather stay this way for a while.  Britain In 10 Years: More Video Surveillance Cameras Than People?  1. How does the increasing use of cameras affect privacy?  You won't be able to have a normal life anymore and i would feel wierd to be followed and watched by cameras. 2. Where do you think it is fair to have cameras installed? Not fair? i think it is not fair to put cameras in people's houses and the toilet but it is fair to put it in the streets and malls. 3. What is your opinion on this subject? it would be cool to have a limited number of cameras around more dangerous places to save people's lives. 4. If you feel that this is an invasion of privacy, how do you feel governments should help increase protection from the inclining terrorist threats?

      Heeelllllooooo!!! my name is stanley. I usualy play playstsation, computer and gameboy. The game that I like to play is Comand and Conquer general, grand thef auto vice city and etc...   I also like to play WWF card. I think that the the best deck is Rey Mysterio because of the ability.  The ability is  "Whenever your opponent reverses a card from his hand or backlash deck, you may discard 2 cards. If you do you may continue your turn. Your cards titled 'From the Top Rope' and 'Springboard' is  -5f" . I think Rey Mysterio best maneuver is  'The West Coast Pop'  . It allows you to have a fast victory.

      Answer for the last question: i think that this is already a good way of protection but i don't really know what else can the government do but if i were the government i would ask every house to have cameras outside their house that cant be really seen by other people so that whenever they hear strange noises they could identify who made it...and call for help.And maybe some in the living room that is hidden in walls, the way to control it is by this kind of keyboard thing and it is always on 24 ours but the TV screen is hidden somwhere...

      Questions and Answers, computer class, section 2:  1. How does the increasing use of cameras affect privacy?   You get less privacy and are observed when you go out in public on cameras. You could be in a videotape that can be watched without knowing it.  2. Where do you think it is fair to have cameras installed? Not fair? I guess it is fair to have cameras installed in shops, public transportation, hotels and in other public areas so that police can catch criminals and help keep people safe. It isn't fair to have camera's in people's houses and private property without thier consent or places like bathrooms and changing rooms.  3. What is your opinion on this subject? I don't really care if there are cameras in shops, public areas ect, because its called PUBLIC. As in people see you anyways and there is nothing you can do about it even if there aren't cameras. You don't get privacy in public places because if you did, it wouldn't be public anyways.  4. If you feel that this is an invasion of privacy, how do you feel governments should help increase protection from the inclining terrorist threats? I don't feel this is an invasion of privacy, but am I supposed to pretend I do for this question? Ok. In that case, governments should put police in place of the cameras, who can watch and can take care of things. Other obvious things for protection without cameras: Don't trust anyone who supports terrorist groups and don't let people carrying bombs into stores.                               THE END

What would be the benefits of this technology?  4. What could become problems with this technology?  5. What other thoughts or opinions do you have regarding this technology  1. This is NOT something I would like to use. What is wrong with credit cards that are actually CARDS anyways? It would be creepy to have a credit card in my skin and annoying to have ads that are just for me be put in stores whenever I come in.  2. Not yet. Not until people can be sure criminals can't get info or frame people using the chips.  3. It would never get lost and would be much easier to go shopping.  4. Criminals could use it and gain info, loss of privacy as well.  5. I have no other thoughts or opinions regarding this technology.                    The end.

      HI. Back again. Apparently this web page isn't done yet. I have to type sumthin more. Hmmm...ok... I have nothing to say. At all. Life is boring. The End. Oh, I have one thing to say... I wish I had internet at home so I didnt have to do this at school. Then again, I wish for alot of other things too, none of which will come true, I guess. Like having a pet, and a camera and a real computer, not a laptop that keeps freezing. Too bad. NOW I'm done. Good Bye.

      1. How does the increasing use of cameras affect privacy?  With the increase of cameras, we would have less privacy. You wouldnt be able to have some time alone in public because there would always be cameras watching.  2. Where do you think it is fair to have cameras installed? Not fair? I think that it is fair to have cameras installed in public places, such as buses, trains, taxi cabs, police cars, bus stations, train stations, airports, stores, banks, office buildings, and other commercial and public locations. I dont think that it that cameras should be installed in living areas, such as homes, apartment rooms or hotel rooms. It also shouldnt be installed in public restrooms.  3. What is your opinion on this subject? I think that installing cameras in public is a very safe idea. That way, more criminals could be caught. I dont think that there is a bad side of this. Neither do I think that there is an invasion of privacy, because cameras would only be installed in public areas, meaning that no one could have had privacy in the first place anyways.  4. If you feel that this is an invasion of privacy, how do you feel governments should help increase protection from the inclining terrorist threats? I dont feel that there is an invassion of privacy so I feel that installing cameras in public areas would be the best way to increase protection from the inclining terrorist threats.

      1. Do you feel this would be something you would like to use? I dont think id use this because i would rather have use a crdit card that is not attached to myself. I think it would be kind of creapy if somthing went wrong with the Verichip but it is still inside of me.   2. Do you think society is ready for technology like this? I think that the society would be able to adapt to this kind of technology pretty quickly since it has adapted to technology which more advance than a Verichip.   3. What would be the benefits of this technology? They then wouldnt need to waste money by hiring anyone for costomer service, or for check out since evrything could be done by technology.   4. What could become problems with this technology? Somthing might go wrong with the Verichip and might casuse somekind of disease. People could just cut off your arm for the chip and go to stores and buy all the stuffs they want to buy with your chip.   5. What other thoughts or opinions do you have regarding this technology. I think that it would be pretty useful for the people who would actually want to use them.
