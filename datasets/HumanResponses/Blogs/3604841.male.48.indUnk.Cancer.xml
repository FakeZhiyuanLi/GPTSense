      O Lord, we bring before You the distress and dangers of Peoples and nations, the pleas of the imprisoned and the captive, the sorrows of the grief-stricken, the needs of the refugees the  impotence of the weak,  the weariness of the despondent;    and weaknesses of the aging. O Lord, stay close to all of them.       O Lord, show Your mercy to us and gladden our hearts. O Good Samaritan, come to our aid. We are like the sheep that went astray: O Good Shepherd, seek us out and bring us home in accord with Your will. Let us dwell in Your house all the days of our lives and praise You for ever and ever with those who are there.       Lord Jesus Christ, thank you for the friends and relatives that You have given us to love us in spite of our failures and weaknesses, and to enrich our lives after Your example. Let us ever behave toward them as You behaved toward Your friends and relatives. Bind us close together in You and enable us to help  one another on our earthly journey.        Grant us a knowledge of the Father and of Yourself. Help us to Cling steadfastly to the Christian faith. In our studies and in our  teaching make us seek only the extension of Your kingdom and Your holy Church both in ourselves and in others.       O Lord, send workers for Your harvest, so that the precepts of  Your only-begotten Son may always be obeyed and His sacrifice  be everywhere renewed. Look with favor upon Your family, and ever increase its numbers. Enable it to lead its sons and daughters to  the holiness to which they are called and to work for the  salvation of others.        Lord Jesus Christ, watch over those who are leaders in Your Church. Keep them faithful to their vocation and to the proclamation  of Your message. Strengthen them with the gifts of  the Spirit and help them to serve Your people, especially the poor and lowly. Give them a vivid sense of Your presence in the world and a knowledge of how to show it to others.       Lord, watch over Your missionaries—priests, religious, pastors,  rabbis, clerics and lay people—who leave everything to give testimony to Your Word and Your love. In difficult moments  sustain their energies, comfort their hearts, and crown their work with spiritual achievements. Let Your Cross, which accompanies them throughout life, speak to them of heroism, generosity, love, and peace.       Sweet Jesus, many indeed have never known You; many, too,  Despising Your precepts, have rejected You. Have mercy on them all and draw them to Your Sacred Heart.       Be King, O Lord, not only of the faithful, but also of the prodigal  children who have abandoned You.       Be King of those who are deceived by erroneous opinions, or whom discord keeps aloof, and call them back to You.       Great God, who has told us "Vengeance is mine," save us from ourselves, save us from the vengeance in our hearts and the acid in our souls.  Save us from our desire to hurt as we have been hurt, to punish as we have been punished, to terrorize as we have been terrorized.  Give us the strength it takes to listen rather than to judge, to trust rather than to fear, to try again and again to make peace even when peace eludes us.  We ask, O God, for the grace to be our best selves.  We ask for the vision to be builders of the human community rather than its destroyers. We ask for the humility as a people to understand the fears and hopes of other peoples. We ask for the love it takes to bequeath to the children of the world to come more than the failures of our own making. We ask for the heart it takes to care for all the peoples  of Afghanistan and Iraq, of Palestine and Israel as well as for ourselves.  Give us the depth of soul, O God, to constrain our might, to resist the temptations of power, to refuse to attack the attackable, to understand  that vengeance begets violence, and to bring peace – not war – wherever we go.  For You, O God, have been merciful to us. For You, O God, have been patient with us.  For You, O God, have been gracious to us.  And so may we be merciful and patient  and gracious and trusting  with these others who you also love.                                                                                         ( Joan D. Chittister, OSB                                                                                             Pax Christi )            Grant, O Lord, to Your Church assurance of freedom and  Immunity from harm; give tranquility of order to all nations; make the earth resound from pole to pole with one cry: Praise to the  divine Heart that wrought our salvation; to it be glory and honor for ever.       Dear God we know You love us. We accept whatever You decide.  We leave everything up to Your divine goodness and loving care.  You are our God.                                          Thank you.       Amen.

      Well, he's gone now. He's in my prayers and I do sincerely hope and pray for the best for Nancy and his family. I can't help but wonder how sick he was throughout his second term. Many of the people in power now were associated with either his or the following administration. The seeds of the problems we have now in The Middle East were planted then. It has been far to easy for us to cozy up with any sleazy dictator as long as he was on 'our side'. It's a foreign policy that has always led to great problems for us and whatever other country or countries are involved. Afghanistan and Iraq are both current examples of how high the price can be. Iran and it's associated problems go back to this same short-sided policy. I thought we had learned from our past but with the appointment of Negroponte as ambassador to Iraq ( biggest embassy in the world ) it doesn't seem as though we have learned anything yet. What price will my boys and their friends and families be forced to pay? How long of a black wall will we build for their generation?

           I am a prolife liberal. I do believe that God gets the ball rolling at the point of conception.  This is a religious belief and I do feel it is the correct one. I am also willing to understand that not everyone is going to share the same religious dogma that I do.  This position gets harder to take as the pregnancy continues and science as well as common sense both comes to the same understanding that a child is indeed dwelling in the womb. I don’t believe it to be right to pass laws solely based on the religious beliefs of a group. Our elected leaders, guided by science, must have the courage to come to a determination at what point life exists and set that as the law of the land. It is then up to the religious community to sway people through evangelization and other forms of religious education to a view more palatable with their religious faith. Individuals contemplating abortion must be moved to keep their child by love and understanding based on faith. Hearts must be softened by instilling a love for Christ.      As a liberal I understand the importance of hope.  Hope is what it's about. When you're on the bottom you cling to hope. A poor struggling single Mom or family is often left with more fear than hope. It becomes easier to rationalize the temptation when you see no help or support anywhere. If you want to stop abortions from happening it is a must to restore hope. They need help. Help that can best come from policies that demonstrate actual care and help. Hope can best be achieved by all of us working together, Church, civilians and government. Help with the bills, medical and child care.       The conservatives make a fuss about abortion being the wrong choice but they do very little about it. Funding programs that care for mothers in need during their pregnancy and the years following are not possible within their ideology. They would rather pay lip service to groups opposing abortion than really trying to tackle all the facets of this problem. They have a vested interest in keeping things the way they are. The status quo brings them votes and along with these votes come more power and riches which has been used to rage an immoral and unjust war, according to the teachings of our saintly pope and our bishops both world wide and at home. They have also pointed out the evil of the death penalty and unjust economic policy. The way the neoconservatives have conducted themselves in response to terrorism along with their many other faults have made it impossible for me to vote for them with a clear conscience.
