						   Well times are really hard at this time.  The conflict is really in full swing.  We made the decision to ask the group that was causing us grief and working against our mission to leave.  We have the full support of our DC however other staff are causing hassles for us because of the Government Funding.  (We have somehow gotten ourselves caught in the middle of a internal Divisional conflict - not that we are buying into it )However, we cannot allow these people to ruin the atmosphere of our centre as they were making some of the people who use our centre feel uncomfortable by their judgmental looks and actions and this is not what we want.  It is going to be tough for some weeks now and we are in the middle of a lengthy process.  Sometimes we have to do hard things to remain true to what God has called us to.  It just feels a little black at the moment but I am sure God will shine through.   It would be nice to be able to get on with the work of building God's Kingdom and leave the hassles behind, however I know that when we are making an impact on the Kingdom of Satan he will come out to attack and discourage, we need to hold onto the fact that God is bigger.  Anyway enough.  We need to hold tight and trust.    Glenda

						   I am in ministry in Tasmania which is the Island state of Australia.  My extended family and one of my sons are on the main land of Australia so there is a stretch of water that seperates us.  Being brought up in a close nit family this really bothered me at first however I count my blessings because where God has placed me I am really fortunate.  My husband and I minister in a congregation that is focused upon looking after those who are disadvantaged in society, it is focused upon bringing people into God's Kingdom.  They care for each other and they care for us as we care for them.  I thank God because there are not many churches that have such a wonderful atmosphere to minister in.  Where else would I be blessed to be able to part of this kind of ministry. Where else would I be fortunate enough to engage with the world in this way?  Here that is where.  Thank you God.

						   It has been a really hard week in ministry.  We made the decision to move out the program from our Corps that is creating problems with our mission - this has caused enormous problems for us so we are trying to work through these issues as present.  (the conflict is sapping our energy levels)  The police arrived on our doorstep with two children that are part of our Corps family as their mother had been beaten senseless by her partner.  The police said that Children's Services would nt respond so they brought them to us.  This makes a total of eight of us in the household.  Another young man takes an overdose.  One of our saints is dying in hospital his daughter rang to say he is at his last.  We have finally found a site for our new thrift shop, the renovation works for our employment programs are going along steadily.  The variety and business is always rewarding however, the conflict, unneccessary conflict saps energy reserves that could be better used for ministry.  Well God is bigger than all of this and we need to trust our situation into his hands.  Glenda

						   Well, I feel as though we are at present being tried by fire.  It is difficult when things happen that are so out of your control and you have to face the music.  We are currently endeavouring to get some people out of our church centre who have been so destructive to our mission and to the other people that work in our corps.  We have the backing of our bosses now so that is good but the in-between guys are making life difficult.  We just want this to end so we can get on with God's business.  Sometimes it would be easier if we didnt have to maintain Christian conduct and just loose it for awhile, but I know that never acheives anything, but it would make you feel good for a little while.  Anyway, we believe God is bigger than anything we have to contend with.  Need some prayers at the moment for wisdom, patience, extended measures of grace and most of all strength to go on.

						   Sometimes I feel as though I wish God would just remove some of the passion that flows through my vein as it often causes me deep pain.  I sometimes have moments when I wish I could just be content with the status quo and just go with the flow.   However, I really dont deep down feel this way,  however, some days it just feels all too hard, when I see so many people outside of the Kingdom of God and so many inside who dont allow us to do what needs to be done to bring them inside the Kingdom of God.   There are times however, when God breaks through and lets me glimpse a touch of heaven, like the other week, I was leading worship and several seekers came forward for prayer and we were singing a song called "They shall come for the east, they shall come from the west and sit down in the Kingdom of God" at that moment God broke my heart once again for those outside His Kingdom and tears streamed down my face, a women in the congregation who had been a long term IV Drug user etc but we had journeyed with her and loved, when she saw my tears she stood up in the middle of the congregation demanding to know "Who had upset me"  The love I have for her was being reciprocated and it made it all OK, the pain and the heartache were worth it in that moment.  I need to remind myself, I need to be reminded that Jesus was spat on, he was nailed to the cross, he was rejeted by his friends yet He still went on to do carry out the Will of His Father and save you and me forever.

						   It's early Sunday morning and I have tossed and turned over night as we are in the middle of making a big decision about a program that operates from our Corps.  The program is a joint program between The Salvation Army and another organisation, the staff are not Christians and do not share our mission goals.  They have been with us for two years and we have had nothing but trouble from them, in fact my husband and I moved out of our office so they could have an office seperate from the other staff because they caused them so much grief.   We are now at a point of asking them to leave,  in my heart I know its right but we know we will have a big tussle with out DHQ, I can never understand why in a movement like ours we have to fight so hard to do mission.  Does anyone have this answer, I'm sure it is the same in other denominations also.   Our Corps members are clearly focused on mission and are looking forward to the new Corps based Employment Programs to start soon.  These are Corps based and owned so we say who works for us and what happens (so good to be able to drive the mission with these programs) Our Centre is not big enough to house those who are working against us without it impacting upon the rest.  I guess I am rambling but maybe God will give someone some wisdom to pass on.  Anyway, enough need to focus thoughts on worship, I love worhsip it takes you away from life for awhile into the heavenlies.  Glenda

						   It's Saturday morning and we finally have a chance to catch a day off, well hopefully it will be a day off.  We are never too sure what the day will bring.  We are just in the process of opening up some employment programs at our Corps and the rennovation works have just started after quite some time of wrangling our way through all the red tape.  We see these programs as a way of enhancing the sense of community that we hope to create at our Corps Centre.  For years the Corps lay dorment during weekdays, now there is a real buzz in the air and we have had to replace nearly every lock on the doors due to high use (Praise God)  It is hard work, many Salvation Army Officers work from the quiet and peace of their own homes, we work from a busy centre where we dont get alot of "so called" work done but we do ministry.  I love it and wouldn't change it for the world, you never know what a day will bring and it is real incarnational ministry just being there for people.  Just last week I went out with one of our Social Workers to do some counselling with one of her clients and ended up in a goal cell with her after a ride in a police car. It is just being where God needs us to be.  I am always thankful for the opportunities he opens up for me in ministry.  The frustrations are always outweighed by the opportunities (well almost always)  Glenda

						   Well, I have enjoyed adding comments to other peoples Blogs, now I am going to have a go at doing this myself so here goes.  This morning I said good-bye to Sam, my husband bought Sam home two nights ago after her mother's boyfriend had bashed her silly, the police wouldnt charge him and nobody would take Sam.  The Department of Family Services wouldnt have Sam Back the Refuges refused to take Sam.  So my husband brought her home to be safe whilst her mother got rid of the violent partner.   I was a little apprehensive, Sam is a very fiesty 15 year old girl who has been around awhile. We have two teenagers ourselves and one six year old.  I must give my children enormous credit as we often have strays like Sam in our home.   However, she was a delight, she was well mannered, well bahaved and all because we had her with us not because we had to (as was the case with other Foster families etc) but because we wanted to.  Even though it is difficult having a strange teenager in your home I kept telling myself, this is what God wants me to do, and everything went fine. I thank Sam for what she has taught me.
