      Working is for stupid people, plain and simple.&nbsp; I realize that while it's not very very realistic, I think that everyone should try to pursue a job that either requires the least possible amount of effort from them or one in which so much joy is gotten that the effort spent is worth it.&nbsp; To this end, I have decided to put forth as little effort as possible to my work in this office.&nbsp; One can see evidence of this in the very fact that I'm using my time today to write this entry!&nbsp; What's more, I've often used my time at work to plan vacations and to balance my checkbook.&nbsp; I will add that my checkbook is the most regularly balanced it's ever been this past year. &nbsp; I think, though, that if I can just tough it out for one semester, I'll be okay.&nbsp; I've decided to try to pull everything together to apply for the winter term at Southern Illinois Univeristy - Edwardsville, which I hope will work out.&nbsp; We'll see.&nbsp; Until then, I shall bide my time ... &nbsp; I've never bided (bode?) my time before; it should be fun!

      In a world free from power, relationships would be a cacophony of harmonies. &nbsp;  Powerlessness  &nbsp;  w   o   u   l   d  &nbsp;  b   e   g   e   t  &nbsp;  Driftlessness  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  w  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  o  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  u  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  l  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  d  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  b  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  e  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  g  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  e  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  t   &nbsp;  Powerlessness  &nbsp; A circle of antipathy and sympathy, weaving webs of wonder. &nbsp; Power.

      I'm not going to go work out today.  I feel bad knowing that I'm going to skip being good, but I can't help it.  Ted and I just got back from our trip to Florida, and with the incentive of having to take of my shirt gone, I have no desire to work out.  It's sad really, though, that I even feel the need to work out.  Let me clarify this a little.  What's sad is that I have no desire to work out for the health benefits.  For that, I feel that I eat well enough and walk twenty minutes each way to and from the light rail to my house when going to and coming from work.  What I really want when I'm working out is one of those bodies that the men on  Out  or  Men's Fitness  always have.  People have (quite logically tried to convince me that they spend hours per day in the gym and get  paid  to look like that, whereas I just get paid to sit on my arse and goof off on the Internet (!) .  Still, I want such a body!

      Have you ever seen that movie  Office Space ?  The protagonist, the one who gets hypnotically cured of his doldrums, points out that "test" that high school counselors give students to learn what they want to be.  The "test" involves thinking of what you would do if you had a million dollars, in other words, if money were no object, what would you do.  The protagonist replies that he'd do nothing.  Now while I agree with him that doing nothing, relaxing and what not, sounds good, I don't think I could do it for an entire day.  In the same film a gangster-rap-loving character with the unfortunate name of Micheal Bolton points out that that "test" is crap because if everyone realized his/her dreams, there would be no janitors, etc.  I think this is true.  High school counselors and optimists in general really ought to stop filling everyone full of hopes.  These hopes have repeatedly gotten me into trouble.  For example, everyone told me so often when I was in high school that because of my grades and my general smarts, I'd get oodles of money to go to school.  Why, in their minds, the schools would just send boxes of money just to  entice  me to go there.  I kept this belief going through a stringent series of extra-curricular activities.  And while I was admitted to every school I applied to, none of them threw money at me.  I ended up going to what I viewed as the crappy state school, because even though they offered no money to me, they were still cheaper than the private schools that had offered money to the tune of half of their fees.  There, the optimism of those around me that spilled into myself let me down.  In college, I worked under much the same guise.  I got horrendously good grades.  I wrote for the student newspaper, double-majored in fours years including a year abroad.  With all of that, I was certain to get into the best graduate programs.  But fat chance.  The programs to which I applied typically have around two-hundred applicants for ten positions.  Those are not good odds, and I'm sure that, like me, every applicant had the best grades with the most glowing letters of recommendation.  I would up getting into the authentically crappy state school (a differnent one now, in a different state) where I work.  The program has turned out to be a dud; I'm trying to escape.  But here again, stupid optimism has gotten the worse of me.  I think that high school counselors need flat out to tell studens, "some of you will be custodians, the vast majority of you will have jobs that will only ever give you enough must just to get by.  You're life will be one of back-breaking work, for mere fractions of what the most successful make, and there's not a damn thing you can do about it.  So, stop your bitching and get to work."

      It's nearing four o'clock central time, which means that it's almost time for me to go to my class.  The class was the most interesting choice that I had, given that fact that it's summer and I'm studying graduate-level philosophy.  Still, I have to admit that I a bit bored with what I knew would be a boring class.  It's on Descrates'  Meditations  which are,  sans question , an extrordinarily important to the philosophical canon.  But that does not, however, make them any more interesting.  The first two times I read Descartes, I was intrigued and excited.  The second two times, I was merely forcibly intrigued.  These last eight or so times have just been overkill.  His philosophy was very innovative for its time.  In retrospect, however, it seems to rely too heavily on the purported existence of a God and on our ability to ascertain valid information through the senses (what he descrbies as "clear and distinct perception").  I would have been tons happier to have taken a class on, say, Hegel or Sartre, Nietzsche or Derrida.  But no, I was stuck learning all over again about seventeenth-century thinking.  Oh well.  It is odd, though, that so far into the present, some disciplines, I would argue most of the letters and many arts and social sciences, still look back to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries with awe.  It's true that it was at this time that these still-interesting fields had their second nascent period, but they've far outgrown and indeed  matured  beyond these beginnings.  Why so much emphasis is given to them, I will never know.

      I've been reading this book by an author named Richard Bowes called  Minions of the Moon .  It's this story of a guy from an Irish Boston family growing up.  He's poor, addicted to everything under the sun, and basically a gay whore.  He even talks about having gone to the YMCA in Boston in his youth to earn money via sexual acts with older men.  This coupled with two other books by gay authors, Bob Smith and David Sedaris, I've recently read has led me to believe that my life as a gay man has been really uneventful.  On the spectrum of messed up to least messed up, Bowes would come first, then Sedaris, Smith, and me.  I'm just so damned normal.  Their binges of cocaine, acid, anonymous sex, violence, etc., expotentially overwhelm the whopping two sexual partners of mine and the small number of times I've puffed some green stuff.  It actually makes me want to dive into that illicit world head first.  But then it occurs to me that the lives that at least Smith and Sedaris have now created (through the characters) resembles the world that I currently have.  I think that a similar world will reveal itself for Bowes as I finish the book, but I can't be sure.  But since their worlds resemble what I currently have without the bad times, should I really care?  But isn't it those horrible times that often give rise to genius that is each artist?  Seadaris's wit is no doubt due to his years of drug-induced stupor coupled with driftlessness and unemployment.  Smith has his days of squeeking by as a cater-waiter in New York City.  Bowes went for it all, dropping his pants for whoever asked.  But my biggest struggles have been dealing with a large credit load and work simultaneously.  I've lived one of those coveted middle-class, seemingly stable lives.  I kind of hate myself for that.  So should I long for a low period?  No, I don't think so.  But maybe I should long for the insight that such periods have given those authors instead.

      The world is a really fucked up place.  It never ceases to amaze me what people do and what people think.  I guess the truth is that it never ceases to amaze me the extent to which people  don't  think.  There's a guy, whom I utterly detest in my office who called in "sick" today; everyone here understands that to mean that Mr. Lazypants is actually out golfing.  I guess he's at least intelligent enough not to have gone golfing yesterday when the heat index was around 112 or so.  Still, his stupidity amazes me.  I, serving as the office pee-on, which I guess is appropriate since I'm wasting valuable office time writing this shite, was doled the task of clearing his calendar of apppointments.  Well, let me tell you just how easy it is to clear a calendar that consists only of times and first names.  I'm apparently meant to have intimate knowledge of everyone in this office.  But, um, no.  This is especially true given the fact that there are three guys in the office (including me) and then six girls.  That limits my potential "I  would  like to know you intimately factor to two of eight.  But OH MY GOD, no.  Upon seeing these guys, everyone would understand my repulsion.  So, that's my first example of human stupidity, Mr. Lazypants who is a near perfect example of this trait.  Secondly, I just have to point out how stupid, and I mean flat out and verifiably stupid, conservatives are.  As I write this, the US Senate is debating the merits (none) and demerits (all) of the proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.  As the media, whom I don't trust, have reported, this amendment is justly doomed to fail.  Who in their right mind would believe that permitting same-sex couples to wed could be so manifestly detrimental to merit an amendment?  We have, if I'm not mistaken, twenty-four amendments to our constitution.  With the exception of the eighteenth (which enacted prohibition), none have limited our civil liberties.  Furthermore, the eighteenth was such a hideous failure that the twenty-first amendment had the sole purpose of repealing the eighteenth altogether.  The twenty-first did not even leave any limits on age or intoxication or anything.  These matters have been defined only afterwards through individual states.  Even then, the federal government has managed to push its policies through the incentive of federal highway funds.  Without the twenty-one year age limit, states get no funding.  Louisiana, until recently, had done without such funds and allowed eighteen year-olds to drink.  Can we imagine a time when the federal government denies highway funding to Massachusetts based on its ability to see truth?  One would hope not.  That would establish a nation in which the bass-ackwards states (like Idaho, Texas, Utah, Alabama, etc.) tolerate only straight WASPs (white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestants) but have good roads.  And one in which forward-thinking states (like Massachusetts, New York, California, Oregon, etc.) have impassable roads but tolerate the masses.  Since the amendment is doomed to fail (as is, I am sure, the entire anti-gay-rights movement), this is not a possible future.  Still, it serves quite well to highlight the pure stupidity that is conservatism.  Here, I'd like to add the caveat that fiscal conservatism is not my beef here.  While I disagree with most fiscal conservatives, because I feel that their system benefits only the rich, I do not feel they are dumb.  They simply have a different, yet valid, outlook.  Social conversatives, meanwhile, are just bible-bangers, unable to think for themselves.
