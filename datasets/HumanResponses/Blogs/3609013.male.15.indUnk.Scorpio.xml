       Ronald Reagan is dead, jesus, leave the man alone.    He wasn't that great a president anyway. My god, when I die, bury my ass in a hole and leave me the hell alone.    My funeral will be this huge "get laid, get shitfaced, get stoned" party, not some "poor poor pitiful me, I died" fiasco. Isn't that how we all want to be remembered? :P   Not this "boo-hoo" crap. Screw that.

       Have you ever pranced around your neighborhood at four in the morning?   You should try it. I figure that you should try it in the window of time from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m.. The clubs close down at 2, so all the college students should be coming home around that time. And people might have to get up early for some strange reason at 5, we all have had one morning where we've woken up at 5.   Any other time than that should be open. So what if somebody sees you? You have to ask yourself, who's more messed up? The guy that runs around his neighborhood naked at night or the the guy that drives around at 4 in the morning to catch the people that run around naked in his neighborhood?

       The philosophy of a drug dealer is to sell for money, right?   Then would a man who grows marijuana in his backyard and gives some to his coworkers or an assistant who works in a doctor's office and can snatch some perscription pills for a friend or relative-- technically they are not "dealers"?    By law, the first man would be nailed with culitivation and posession with intent to distribute, which would make him a drug offender no different from the hardcore crack sellers from detroit. The second man, depending on what he took for his pill-popping buddy, could be charged with numerous counts who-knows-what. But is he a drug dealer?   I could be a drug dealer. I have experience... of sorts. I remember sneaking candy in my backpack into the cafeteria at my middle school and selling pixie sticks at a deal, 5 for 25 cents. I remember slipping bags of M n M's into coat pockets with one hand, receiving two quarters in the other hand, and keeping my posture upright so as not to draw attention to myself and get busted by a lurking custodian or principal.    I remember the fear of getting questioned by a teacher why I had so many quarters in my pocket. I remember intimidating other "candy salesman" in the younger grades to stop their business. I remember me and my "business associate" would get pissed about having to lower our prices so as to draw the customers back to us after a rival enterprise of a higher grade lowered their Hershey's price from 50 cents to 40.     I remember sneaking candy in our underwear so that the Kash n Karry barcode detectors wouldn't ring and we could smuggle candy for our store out, ripe for the selling.   Does this make me any less of a drug dealer than that of a detroit thug? The stakes were a might lower, yes, but we were a might younger and the idea of suspension or a phone call home would have been as ominous as the idea of 10 to 15.   The philosophy is the same.
