      I was suprised when my name was announced in the school assembly... I was selected to be a school prefect under probation....  With this, i will have more responsibilities and i hope i could carried out my duty efficiently.... I would like to congratulate to Khadijah, Atiqah and my other friend who also had been nominated as a prefect next year.Perform the best for our school !!! ~~~  Anyway congratulation to  Arsenal because they got their 2004/05 season off to the perfect start by reclaiming the Community Shield from Manchester United with a 3-1 victory in the traditional curtain raiser to the English football season.

      It's an unforgettable day on the last Friday when i accidently hurt my good friend. That morning we were having PE lesson and the teacher was not around, so we decided among ourselve to play Softball. We were very happy then. When it was my turn to bat, i didn't notice that there is someone behind me...... i accidently lost my grip with the Sofball Bat... and the bat slip from my grip and hit A's left eyebrow... I was so shocked to see his head bleeding,,owhh my God!! So we quickly carry him to the Surau.... A's hold my arm very tightly because he was very worried at that time.. so my shirt was covered with blood...  He wonders whether there will be any stitches involves....  And a few minutes later, our teacher came and took him to the clinic. He came back about an hour later with bandages on his eyebrow and at the same time i feel relief to see him ok... Based on the information that A's told me, he got 4 stitches....  Astonishingly, he was  surrounded by the girls in school anxiously to know about his well being.. At the same time, he jokingly ask me.. who is going to take care of his girlfriend if he dies.  Anyhow i felt so bad about what happen on that Friday... I pray that he will get well soon....  By the way i like to wish Happy Birthday to Afif..... thank you for the   pulut kuning....   Get to go now.... See ya.....
