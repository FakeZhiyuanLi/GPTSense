            Well then. To begin. Tonight began as a night like any other in the summer. Hot, humid and, as always, at Noah's house. There, at Noah's, the Super Friends of Arlington gathered. Jeremy, Paul, Eric and later Siping. With our Super Friends Travis and Chris abroad, we were forced to defeat Mega Stan and Queen Juliet's food of doom.        Jeremy singlehandedly defeated four burgers, three hotdogs and countless chicken wings. Paul overpowered at least ten unsuspecting chicken wings. Noah and I ate a burger and three wings each because we, uh, were saving room for desert. Yeah, thats it. Desert.        Anyway. Moving on to Robbin's Farm, we encountered hordes of pre-pubescent teens trying to fight. We had brought a bag of cherries with us, which for some reason caused some giggly little shits to act like they new us. Damn.        Glowsticks were for sale so naturally I bought two. At dark, we settled on suicide hill until the fire works. We made fun of people and Siping, while kids from our school thought it would be fun to start a shaving cream fight with the six of them. Silly kids, shaving cream is for riots and fun stuff, not the fireworks!        We heard another gaggle of people behind us that we knew wishing they had glowsticks. Every time the would-be-rioters dropped a glowstick, we threw it to the gaggle. This was fun for a while, but it got old. Then, just as we contemplated our swift departure, we noticed a pair of glowsticks caught in a tree. The only option we had was to retrieve those glowing strands of bliss.       Jeremy, Siping, and I set out with sticks and rocks to hurl at the glowsticks while the growing crowd held it's collective breath. After Jeremy threw a root from a small tree he pulled out of the ground, he broke the small plastic connection holding the glowing ring in place. To our surprise, the crowd began to cheer. Then after like three seconds it stopped and we became normal people who no one cared about again.       Other highlights; Jeremy tackling Tom Fitz when Tom was being stupid; Me yelling at some fat, balding  30 year old loser with a laser pointer; and the fireworks ending so we could leave.        Overall a good night, which should end very soon with me falling peacefully asleep in my Air Conditioned room.       BTW: I am the official Word-Smithy; a smith of words. Word-smithies can be poets, authors, play rights, but never George W. Bush's speech writer, or Mr. Woodcock. Stay sat.

      Good morning Viet... Arlington. I'm here in lovely Webser, New York. I've pigged out on turkey, cranberries, special family jello, and mashed potatos. Yes, yes, I know. It's been months since I even thought about posting here. Sorry. I hope none of you contemplated suicide while I was away. I'm back now and everything is gonna' be alright. So. School. First term was a wake up call. I moved up in english and math on level and realized that it would be harder. I scraped by with low a's and high b's, but I earned a C+ in math. Boooo... Semi-formal. Good enough to write about, at least. I danced quite a bit, made a few new friends, and left just as sober as I was when I came in. Funny story: while I was dancing, I saw one of those little bottles of liquor roll across the floor. I heard a bunch of people got kicked out, but mostly for fighting. My trip to Montanta... in August. It was pretty fun. I went fishing with my cousin, ate  way  too much food, and was generally lazy. What have I been looking at lately, you ask?  urlLink http://mehalan.proboards23.com  - This is my friend Requiem's board. Great if you are from AHS because there is, well, an AHS related board.  urlLink http://www.spymac.com  - My all time favorite Macintosh related website.

      It has come to my attention that a certain someone, actually one of the 3 people that read my blog, wants his name mentioned. Noah. Oh yeah. Travis. Kevin. Anyway, even if this heinous thing hadn't come to my attention, I would have mentioned Noah anyway. For tonight, I have been invited to a partay (yes - AY!) at Noah's house. If you are coming bring party supplies. Last night, I went to Travis's house, watched Futurama, then went to Kevin's and watched the simple life. Paris Hilton is fiyiyine. Nicole is not-as-fiyiyine-as-Paris-Hilton-fiyiyine. I'm so jealous of that guy that Paris and Nicole are staying with. If the season ends and he is still a virgin, he should kill himself. Time to go have a ham sandwich and wish the Hilton sisters were coming to my house. Peace.

      Do you know what is completely unnecessary? Any of the discovery channel's animal shows. Do we really need to see that many snakes, tarantulas, scorpions, lizards, phirrana, crocodiles/alligators, sharks, whales, dolphins, monkeys, birds, kangaroos, and large cats? Honestly. Why do they have so many? I think it's all the animal sex that keeps people there. Animal shows have even penetrated the country's favorite mid morning talk-show, Regis and Kelly. I was watching the special episode this morning that showed all those wacky (their word, not mine) antics (their word) that Reg' and Kel' took part in this year. A tarantula crawled over Regis's head. The audience screamed a lot. Was it a "wacky antic"? No. It was a dumb white guy who doesn't know that if an animal can kill you, it's best to stay away from it. Now he's right up there with all the other cock blocking "croc' hunters". Big deal Regis. I wanted to be a Millionaire - you just didn't call on me.

      Yesterday I saw somthing amazing. Siping beat Megaman X in 1 and a 1/2 hours. It was amazing. He only died twice. And do you know why this was possible? Siping is Chinese. That's all. I have to clean the house today. We are cleaning the basement workshop so we can get the boxes wired up for ethernet, phone and cable tv. Biatch. I was denied entry to "Bad Santa" at my local theater, the Capitol. I was, needless to say, pissed off. Who denies teenagers who aren't 17, but look even older? For those of you who don't know me personally, I'm 6' 5", 220 lbs. I look older than 17. So instead of watching the movie we went home.

      Greetings fellow Christmas celebrators. The stuff? You reall want to know? Ok: LaCie 4x DVD burner, a new iPod dock, strongbad t-shirt, a board game called Red-Handed, new socks like Noah's brother Aaron had, "True Grizz" a book about grizzly bears, the Worst-Case Scenario holiday book, a new clock, a "Coinstruction" set, asweater, a pair of khackis, and slipppers. I would say I did damn well. We ate some carmel strata for breakfast - for you uncultured suckas thats french toast with carmel. We also ate pineapple and strawberries. Get this: going to have tea at 2:00. That's high class.

      Yesterday was teh fun, as soon as school ended, that is. I made the cold ass trip from China Cafe to Travis's house, where we pigged on Chi. I watched the goofy style of T on DDR. Very goofy indeed.  Around 7 Jeremy picked me and Travis up. Chris and Liz came too. The traffic was Xtreme, Jeremy managed to make someone so mad, they turned their brights on him. Bastards. Jeremy ran in and got the tickets for us and we went to Toys 'R Us, biatch. As any high school age kid might, we headed straight for the toys on wheels.  The movie "the butterfly effect" was great.  Hopefully i'll post some more inspired news when someone calls me and gets me off my ass

      This morning, I am reminded of Ugly Ducking's "I Wanna Go Home", a tune about hating work and putting up with stupid people in the office. Time for school. The time is 6:47 and the sun has not even begun to rise. Band is in 13 minutes. See you there.

      Let's photo! Has anyone seen these disgusting, ill-conceived ads? To numbskulls are sitting on a pile of bricks. Their dick boss comes over and tells them to move the pile two feet to the left, and then leaves to go masturbate. The two neanderthals look at each other with excitement and cry, "Let's Photo!" They take pictures of themselves (and probably post them on a gay porn site) and move the bricks. Then the asshole from RITZ camera comes on and he's all "take pictures and we'll rape you for money blah blah..."  This is the best part though. The boss comes BACK and tells them to MOVE the BRICKS BACK to WHERE they WERE. The idiot workers don't care. They say "LET'S PHOTO! AGAIN!" Assholes. By the way - see you at school tomorrow!

      Cave-men, back in the day, had it better than any one has ever had it. Just think about it. There were no marital laws, so you could bang every cave woman for miles around. If you were a big cave-man with a big club, you might not get the crap beat out of you. No child support either - cave-men were home-free. Cave-men didn't have to wake up and go to work. They woke up, grabbed the nearest alcoholic fruit and went for a piss. Then, they hunted down a big piece of meat. Tell me that you wouldn't hunt a big piece of meat while drunk off fruit. That's what I thought. After a caveman whacked his meat (excuse me), killed his prey, he got to have a barbecue. EVERY NIGHT a barbecue. Heck - he'd probably get out some alcoholic berries and invite every cave-woman he could find. I wish I was a cave-man.

      This is going to be a short one. I've got to build a shelf and mount blinds in my room tonight. "Monkeys moving robotic arms by manipulating a cursor on a computer screen, simply by thinking about it? Mice who cause their water tube to dispense some refreshing H2O just by wishing it? Signal processing and decoding has long been a dream of Matrix fans and lazy system administrators for years, and science is amazingly keeping up! Popular Science's Carl Zimmer has written a fascinating piece documenting recent progress in decoding brain signals and interpreting commands issued from thoughts alone. If you heard a single violin playing Beethoven's 5th, you would be able to tell what piece of music was being played even though the rest of the orchestra was not heard. In the same way, by monitoring a relatively few neurons, computers can recognize patterns and allow programming based on these patterns to say, know if a mouse is thinking about pushing his water lever. You can pass the time waiting for Matrix-style video games and motionless system adminstration/utilization by reading the full article."   urlLink Read here.  Less sooner.

      Update. I have brought it to my attention that I apologize _way_ too much. No more of that. I'm not sorry, neither. I plan to update MWF from now on. If I don't, stfu ::coughtraviscough::. Hokai. Soh. I went to the Bahamas, met some kick ass Bahamians, and went to Fepcot. That is one sweet trip you might say. YES!  (Horray for accents edition!)  Thursday, 2/12 Went to the airport, got in the plane. USAIR flight 9021whothefuckcares0.   Friday, 2/13 Today really was fun. We went to bed at about 1:00 in the AM, so I was a little sleepy after a day of travel. We traveled via PEGAUS! bus lines to Port Canaveral. On the way, we met Dennis, our cruise director. When we arrived at the boat, I was pretty amazed by its size. 3 football fields long (Duh, 100 yards x 3), featured a rock wall to climb, probably a dozen bars, lounges and entertainment places (though few band members were thoroughly entertained here).  We got these cool little cards to put money on, credit card style. A few people I was with figured that the cruise line uses them to keep us from knowing how much we spend on Pina Coladas. Before we got on the boat, they took our picture so when our card got scanned they knew it was us. Annoying and cool! For a boat 3 fb fields long, you'd think the rooms would be vast. If you do think this, however, you are mistaken. The room was 7' x 7'. The bathroom was 4.5' x 2'. The shower was shitty, because drying required a degree in Kama Sutra. It also smelled in there, because they used sea water for the toilet. The same goes for the pool, which, I was told, used sea water. I decided not to use the pool because there were too many mullet-wearing rednecks on board with hairy, fat stomachs.  We ran through a drill on getting to our "muster stations". I learned how to use the life-vest's clippy things that is on just about, oh say, EVERY FUCKING PIECE OF CLOTHING. The loud-speaker lady invited us to a "pahtehy". I translated her ridiculous aussie accent to mean there was some sort of merriment going down on the poop deck. I skipped it.  We ate lots of food.  Saturday, 2/14 The boat landed in Nassau in the mid-morn.  "This is you captain, Captain Grimstad. We have arrived in Nasshau. (this was said extremely fast. try it. it's fun!) The temperature in Nasshau is a balmy *aetie-two deegrees forenhite*." We repeated this over and over. At least until we set foot on the island, where we got a quote never to be forgotten. This came from a rotund Bahamian woman, just outside of the building tourists had to pass through. She was trying to get us to take a bus tour through the city. "Be amazed by steeng rays, monta raes, eegle raeys, shaaks, and ova fowtee thousand varieties of tropeecal feesh! See whea the reech leeve, ahnd whea the poors live!" We didn't go on the bus. The idea of shaaks didn't sound fun. We did manage to work our way over to the public beach. Dan, Guy, Gorch, and I swam for a good 25 minutes. From the water, I was sure no one would try to hustle me. I could see Issac being tricked into buying the same puca shell neclace for $10 that every stand in the market had for 3/$1. All of a sudden... "Do you want to go to da white wall, mon?" (what the fuck is wrong with those people? do they think they are Jamaican?) "Uhh, huh?" (from another swimmer) "I don't think they have enough balls to go to da white wall, mon!" I looked around and realized the white wall was a piece of formed cement that people were jumping off of. This guy was actually trying to hustle me into taking me to a public WALL to jump! I didn't go, but realize now that jumping from that wall would have been a life changing experience.  We shopped around, I got some goods. You know what I mean.  We returned to the boat after only a few short but memorable hours on the island of Nasshau.  Sunday, 2/15 This day was weird. We played for Dennis, who we were learning more and more about. Not only was he our cruise director, but he held equipment in his room, arranged for instruments and a concert on-deck, is the president of the company, and arranges to have about 90 other bands sail yearly. Damn. We earned "superior", out of a possible "good", "excellent", and "superior". I even got a sweet trophy for "Outstanding Soloist". We spent much of the day on the cruise line's private island. The pronunciation is still being hotly debated. Dennis said that even though it is spelled "Cococay," it is actually pronounced "Coco-key". Everyone on the boat, including our captain, Captain Grimstad, pronounced it "Coco-kay". The island was a little too perfect - you know. Man-made-esque. I had no problem with that though. I swam in the crystal blue waters for 4 hours. I think I heard it was snowing in Boston that day. Suckas.  When we returned to the boat, a "Weather System" was moving in. We played for a few boat riders, but the wind almost stymied our efforts.   Monday, 2/16 Our hotel had some computer problem so we stayed outside by the hot tub soaking our feet. It was really nice sitting with a dozen friends in the Floridian sun. We cracked jokes. Fun. We went to the Hard-Rock Cafe in (announcer style voice) Universalstudiosorlandoflorida. The food was "eh", and when they say hard rock, they mean Yanni. I didn't get to ride any rides due to time constraints, but I had a great time going in the stores and listening to performers. I bought a NASCAR cafe hat here for only $5.   Tuesday, 2/17 On this day, we visited Epcot, or as jazz band members called it, "Fepcot." The food here was really great. It was also in abundance. Ten points for D-nizzle.  The problem with this park is the lack of fast shit. I went on that "amazing" and "realistic" mission to Mars ride. Maybe if you were on acid or something. The line was too long for a 1 minute ride like that. I couldn't get to test track, but I heard it was great. Next time. I rode spaceship earth 4 times and the Monorail/Fonofail 3 times. One time I actually fell asleep and drooled. Ha ha, Yes! We returned to the Hohtehl. Lights were out by "11".  Wednesday, 2/18 We were out of that hohtehl by 6:45 AM. We landed in Boston at 3:00 PM. I don't remember much of what happened, as I was tired.  Less sooner. Ex pax.

      Parents, remember when? It's back again! Amazing Elastic Plastic! Hey all you (five) dedicated look-atters of my blog. Sorry for such infrequent updates, but I've been busy. I'll make this a real winner. This week was far from being "da-bomb". On Sunday night, I fell asleep _very_late_. I woke up on time, got ready on time, and even got to school early. Problem was, I forgot my Concerta, the thing that makes my day go by. Some of you might have noticed me falling asleep, drooling, or staring into space. I apologize for that. The clincher for Monday: I got a thesis paper assignment. 7-8 pages (double spaced; thank you Microsoft for the one thing you actually did right) about gothic horror. Now, I'm not typically one to whine about long assignments, usually owing to their far away due dates. My english teacher decided that two and a half weeks would be plenty of time for this sucker. After all, we do have the whole vacation to work on that, right. Pfft.  The rest of the week went a little better, mostly because I remembered my Concerta. I should give some of it to all my friends, so if I ever forget it, they can all just give me some.  "Eric, you aren't paying attention today. Are you okay?" "Just gimme a few red caps. I think I'll manage if you just help me out." This week is going to suck. I can feel the finger looming about the giant vacuum switch. It will only be a three day + three period week, but that makes it just that much harder. You see, my fellow students, I will be traveling to the Bahamas on Thursday. I know, I know. Don't think I have forsaken you. If you give me a dollar, I'll even buy you a trinket; two dollars, and I'll buy you some booze. Psyche!  I'll be back on Wednesday in the middle of the vacation, so I can have a shindig with some of you poor folks.  I will also be missing the yearly School street tradition we call "Squash Drop". My neighbors decided to drop a squash off their front porch. Lame? Yes. Fun? Sort of.  Ok, this wasn't a winner, but I felt like telling you all the shitty things I've been up to. Peace for now, hate for later.

      Ok. Finally. It has been a little while since I updated, and this time I truly am sorry. This whole week I kept saying "I'll just do that, uh, tomorrow!", for just about everything. School was wiggidy whack, because I had to write a short story that was piss-poor. Travis gave me a summary of his and if it fought mine in a cage match, mine would have come out with less balls.  So then Friday rolls around. The day I had been waiting for. All week I thought about Friday. True relaxation came. I went to Travis's with Noah and played Halo. Scores were T-25 E-8 N-6 then T-25 E-7 N-7. But really, I wasn't trying. At about five, Jeremy, Farid, and Liz came over and we went out to Anna's Taqoria (sp?). Farid backed his car into a cement wall and dislodged his rear bumper. Fortunately, he had a roll of duct-tape. Jeremy and Farid were going to try and tape that shit on the wrong way. Then I came out of left field all MacGyver style and was like, "No, you don't have enough paper clips. Get me a piece of paper, a tooth pick, and a match, and I'll fix it." They went off to get it, and I just taped it on. They came back and they were all, "Do you still need all this shit?" So we start driving off and Travis and Liz decide to flip the bizzle to these college kids from the way back seat. One of them freaks out and Farid goes all James Bond on us and drives like he's the man. He swerves through cars in the parking lot, T and L screaming "Oh, shizzle my nizzle! That white fellow is gonna catch us! Floor it Jam- Farid!" We made it to Mass ave from the P-lot and as we drove away, we saw that stupid white kid flash us the "Westside" sign. Both hands, actually. I'm surprised he could manage such a complex motor function. He had, after all, just chased a bunch of stupid high school kids for giving him the mid-f. After that, we rolled to the T-Pad and chizzled. Viewed Harold and Maude and cried a little cry. For those who might care, it makes me sad to say that I think Liz hates my guts. I don't know wtf I did, but that's how it looks. It's too bad too. It's another friend that we each could have earned, but I guess not. What ev. Yesterday (Sat 31) suxxored. I did nothing all day. Today was similar, but I read 70 pages of Ethan Frome.  I'm going to go root for the Panthers to piss my dad off. Then, when they score a touch down, I'm going to scream "HOME RUN! GO CATS!" Peace in.

      Good morning, readers! I'm finally updating again, after what seems like days of not. Probably because it has been days. So. I went to Siping's house yesterday. It was awesome. If you had ever been to Siping's house before and seen his room, you know it was small and messy. My friends, Siping cleaned his entire room, rearranged, AND got ps2 with a TV. (Man, I need to go do something outside. My excitement over this is NOT a good sign...) We played some SSX3, DDR, and Kindom Hearts. I'm going to get a haircut. Fuck man, I was really hoping I could just let my hair go forever.   -Ok I definetly forgot I was writing this 10 hours ago-  Party is over and now I'm recovering from DDR. Trav skipped Liz's party, Siping skipped being at home, and Noah came over. John P. and Nick K. also dropped in for a stay, but eventually went to Liz's house.  So full and so tired. Less on my condition, sooner.

      I don't really want to update, because I am le tired. I am about to commit a sin on my personal scale; I try my hardest to never whine about my scholastic trials and tribulations, but alas, today that is what I must do. Math sucked, Latin sucked, science sucked, history sucked, English was ok. Boo hoo.  Less whining, sooner.

      Fraday, Maach Tweve. Was it fun? Maybe. Was it Krazy, as in Krazy Karry's? Well... A restauRANT I told my friend Billy I'd go and eat at where he works, a new restaurant that opened yesterday in the Centa. It's called Krazy Karry's. I was really excited, because I like burgers, and my friend would be making them. The only problem I had with the KK was that it took 30 minutes to get our food. I have decided I will wait at least a month, maybe two, before I go again. I believe the problem was that the 7 teenage workers didn't have what most restaurants have: rythym. But with Billy on the team, things will go ok Fo' Sho'.  Later, Travis's dad picked Noah and me up and took us home. Travis and Kevin were also there, but Travis's dad was the one who was coming over to hang out. My dad brought home a new projector from work and we spent most of the evening in there watching Mystery Men (synonymous with "wicked old skool flick"...) and playing Halo. Halo only lasted 15 minutes because the parentals needed sleep. Pfft! Fuck sleep! Noah's usual character was called "Jammin'", but Will, my brother, snagged it. So Noah, his usual avatar snagged up, took one that I think Siping uses; Noodles. I quickly forgot that Will had this nick and thought Noah had it as usual. I got fragged by my pueri de frato but thought it was Noah! We shat on him time and time again, all the while HE thought he was Jammin'! Oh the humanity!  Satwodae, Mawch Twerteenth Noah came over, we watched Kiki's delivery service. Played games. Stop.   Toodee I was found dead at the scene. Speculations suggest SAT prep is the cause.  Less on this story, sooner.

      Ok. So. I was on AIM last night, and I was satisfying my addiction for looking at people's profiles. If I don't look at every profile I can, I feel like I missed my favorite show. What a lame thing, huh? Well, things were going great. I learned that Nathanial got his server running, and that Travis was out pimpin' the 'hood. Things were going awesome, and I was almost done checking out the pro's. Then, I got to this girl's pro and I had to stop. I can't tell you who, because it's really stupid. Here is somthing that you should never put in your profile; "Me and my bf Mikey 4 eva!" What is wrong with you? Do you really need to let Mikey know that you and him are an item? How romantic do you really think it is? At least it's not a tatoo - you can change Mikey to Steevie next week when Mikey doesn't "fulfill all of your needs" anymore. Damn, that pisses me off.   Less sooner, this is Eric Datsmard reporting from Arlington High Heaven. Tom, back to you.

      Time for one of my (ir)regular updates. We had a concert at the Ottoson. I got to leave at 10:00! I went home, ate a big 'ol lunch and took a shower. Then, I stupidly went an hour early assuming that someone would be there (Mr. D, Mr. Tassone, Ms. Hemenway, janitor, George W. Bush...). No one. I sat around for 45 minutes after talking to Mr. Foley (he didn't need any help...) and Ms. Packer (I don't think she did either!).  The concert went really well when everyone showed up. I had a great time playing with the "Jizz" band and Symph. band. Orchestra was iffy though. LOTR is becoming stale.  I found a funny story  urlLink here...  Okay! You know the line! Less sooner!

      Greetings, fellows. Celtics game tonight against Orlando. My aunt and uncle are here from Montana. They are sleeping in my room, so I've been crashing in the basement and will be until Friday.  Okay. Here is something that has really been bothering me. There is a person in one of my classes who is a fake. A total fake. They have been extremely fake-y for as long as I have known them. Now, the severity of this person's fake-ness has increased to a point beyond tolerability. It's pissing me off, and I think it is communicable via air. IF YOU ARE A FAKE, KNOCK THAT SHIT OFF, BITCH!

      My, my. It has, indeed, been a while since my last update. Not much has gone on, mind you, but still enough to deserve an update. Yesterday I finally left the house. I hadn't truly gone anywhere since dropping Kevin, Noah, and Siping off on Saturday. That party was the shizz man. So Noah comes over and Travis is "busy" with ykw. To make up for Travis's absence, Kevin and Siping come over  with  the  PS2 . Pizza was had, along with brownies (Trav, you missed out, they were  delicious ) and DDR was played.  If you want to see something funny, come over and watch Noah play DDR. Or better yet, my brother Will. They looked like  urlLink this . Just kidding. Siping has added new words to the list that previously included words like people, animal, etc. The list now includes single and double. These were discovered when playing DDR. Siping began announcing the arrows coming up. It was so funny, I got an  E  because I was laughing so hard.  Back to the events of yesterday. I didn't really plan on doing anything, but out of the blue, Magni called me and we decided to go to the square. I gave Travis a call and he decided to go as well. Jeremy Ma gave us a ride, on the condition that he would get to look at hotel prices for his... sister... ehem.  John Penny and the Tate-meister himself called and they met up with us in the squizzle. We ate way too much pinocchio's pizza. I went and got a CD from this Chicago based musicain,  urlLink TRS-80 . Bought way too much Japanese candy. Then we hopped into John's whale of a Chrysler and rolled home to some funky bass beats.   Less interesting stuff, sooner.

      Giggle giggle...  urlLink Biatch...   So I was watching some TV today. The Sci-Fi channel, to be exact. I suddenly heard an movie preview type of voice and was reminded of Pablo Francisco's bit about previews. The movie was being hyped as some bad-ass apocalypse movie and I was thought,  "Eh, whatever. Doesn't even sound that great, even though the announcer has a great voice..."  So the advert goes on, I listen, watch, absorb. It gets more bad ass. I heard quite a few screams of terror typical to apocalypse movies. Cool.  Then all of a sudden, I heard this: "This presentation is brought to you by Sara Lee deli meats."  Awesome. Less deli meat, sooner.

      He! KI! Yeh so WEH! I get this a lot. Something in the water given to the AHS football players makes them slur words together. Common variants on this include, but are not limited to: He! Ki! Yeh so Ge! (Ge or Ghe) Yeh so weh keh! Whattha Fah? Yeh so weh keh! Shuttha Fahuh! (Fahuh has been heard "Fahup," but this is the word of legends...)  Ok. Remember that controversial post I made about people putting personal stuff in their AIM Profile (WAY back in March - on the 12th)? Well, I was partially right. This chick has split with Mikey, and John is her new "boo". Apparently, 4eva means until last week. People have become so hurried to get to the next text message from a friend, the next IM, the next e-mail, the next text sex, what have you, that they can't even spell out "forever." Seven simple letters, signifying an indefinite amount of time, supposedly unmeasurable - nay - incomprehensible to human mental capacities. So, I submit that when a member of an intimate relationship can't even move their fingers a total of 1.5 extra inches for their partner, something is seriously fubar. LADIES: I WILL MOVE 2 MAYBE EVEN 3 INCHES FOR YOU. YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S AT.  Tonight was Passover. Travis: You are so gefilte, it's meshuga! Oyvay! Less passing, sooner.

      You know what? I'm the man. I'm the man because I say so. -UpdatE- School has still been happening and I really want to know why. We tell everyone (administration, teachers, students, friends, parents, god, 50 cent, ect.) that we don't think it's good. Some people even skip to go do things like eat burgers. If school were really, truly important, then people would put it before fast food. I wouldn't care though, because I have no car. That's probably good, because fast food is pretty addicting.  I saw a commercial for a shampoo or somthing from Pantene, the makers of that "pro V" crap. So I'm actually enjoying what they are showing - hot chick few clothes. But all of a sudden, they blurt out,  "And this 2 in one shampoo and conditioner is proven to make your hair LOOK 35% thicker!" What? Since when can any human walk up to a person and say, "My God Sally! Your hair! It must be AT LEAST 35% thicker than it was at orgy night last week!" The hair products industry must be full of shit. All their products do is take crap out of your hair, nothing more. Don't buy anything that says it does more. Buy the one that does the least. It won't give you cancer.  Less on hair, sooner.

      Where to begin... Prom night was friday, as those of you who read this blog probably know. I went with Kali -  urlLink she   urlLink looked   urlLink awesome . I really had a blast with her and the other limo riders.  The music at the prom was about a 7 out of 10, mostly because a bunch of the songs were new at the first dance I went to in 7th grade. Would I do it again? In a heartbeat.   Some folks told me today that they really liked the Cici story, so I'll dust off a few oldies for yeh.  Mr. Mahoney, the wanker science teacher, was trying to explain how atoms with a greater atomic number are more unstable than atoms like Hydrogen, Helium, or even Oxygen, that have a low atomic number. He could have said this: "High numbered, heavy elements like Uranium can't hold their 235 electrons very well. The electrons are spinning very fast.  The outer most electrons are not as close to the center as the others are and therefore do not receive as much pull from the protons in the nucleus." Instead, he chose to treat us like we were stupid. "Unstable atoms are like  urlLink Michelle Kwan ," he started, producing mild giggling. "No, no! Just listen! When she is spinning really fast, she puts her arms really close to the inside, and she doesn't fall over. Just like an atom, right?" At this point, the wiener looked at us, smiling. Like a big dumb dog.  "But then when she, uh, you know, opens her arms, she slows down and, uh, moves lower to the ground..." Just like an atom, huh?  Another time, he was trying to explain the electron shell levels of atoms. He started off in the same stupid way, attempting to form an analogy that was completely... well... retarded. "Electrons can't just jump from shell to shell, okay?" Most of us knew this, but those who didn't were stoned anyway. "It's just like how you can't jump from the bottom set of stairs to the top-" This is where I jumped in - Kali you might remember this. "Siping could!" "No, he couldn't," Mr. Mahoney tried to recover. No one was listening to him, so we probably just sat around and did nothing for the rest of the class, like usual.   Less reminiscing, sooner.

      Back from my trip, now I'm just chillin' in the Library. Actually, I have been back for a whole week and didn't feel like telling you all the awesome stuff that I've been up to. So. Awesome stuff. Uh... Let's see... I uh... No, that was Travis and the Leaky Cauldron.  I have pretty much done nothing since my trip and recounting the details would be too painful.  I would like to tell you a funny story that I've been meaning to post. In 9th grade, I had Mr. Mahoney for Physical Science. Mr. Mahoney was kind of a dick. My buddy Siping will tell you. Mr. Mahoney used to call him "Slee-ping," despite Sipings great annoyance. He even threw erasers, covering this normally calm and reserved Asian with chalk dust.  Anyway, Mr. Mahoney stepped out of class for a few minutes, and we immedieatley decided something destructive must be done. For a while, we had been eyeing the unused outlets sticking out of the floor. Fingers were too big,and paper wasn't conductive enough. Paperclips? PERFECT. Who would be the sticker? It was more a question of who had the least to lose. I didn't want to - losing my Harvard scholarship would have  killed  my parents... It finally came to Cara Collins, or as she is better known, Cici. We didn't want Pinhead coming back in smelling burnt skin and hair, so to protect our brave Cici, we stuck the paperclip in a little book and set her to work. It took a little pushing, but she soon stuck the clip into the outlet. BOOM ZAP! THe clip burned the book around it and Cici rolled onto her back from the squating position she was in.  "WHOA!" she said. We decided mischief was better when it didn't involve near death experiences.

      From my 9th grade science class:  Eric Dramstad  Earth No More 	 It was announced only several days ago that the Earth would imminently explode into oblivion, leaving behind only space dust. Quickly, team Dramstad-Noble rushed to their science teacher in search of a space ship he might have hanging around. Kali refused to die, and Eric was a tag along. Dennis Mahoney happened to have one slightly used spaceship and gladly gave it to them, unaware that the Earth was going to explode in few days time. 	Kali and Eric scoured their city to find necessary supplies for the trip. They collected a pair of space suits with replacements as well as pants, drills, fuel, solar panel equipment, rope, dirt, seeds, water, growing lights and other necessary elements for a garden, rabbits, chickens and a coop, goats, a greenhouse kit, food, water and a filtration system, feed for animals, a vacuum cleaner, air filtration system, two Segway scooters, many other clothing items and tools. The animals also had sleep chambers specially sized and shaped for them, made out of sticks and gum. 	Once they had obtained their supplies, team Dramstad-Noble packed them into the cargo hold of the ship and they were ready to go. 	Before boarding, Kali and Eric took one last breath of fresh air and then started the ship. As the rockets fired up, a deep rumble came from the ground. They realized it was minutes before the explosion. They lifted off immediately.  	When they were passing the moon, the Earth came to its dramatic end. Even from the space ship Eric and Kali could see the Earth shake. Then the shaking just stopped. For an entire minute, the Earth stood still – or so it seemed. They saw huge waves, some as large as Africa moving from the center of the ocean. In just seconds the continents were obliterated. Soon the whole planet was shaking again and lava spewed from underwater cracks. Then it exploded. Exactly like the Death Star. With John Williams music.  	As much as Eric and Kali wanted to cry, they couldn’t. All that they could do was set the ship on autopilot and climb into their specially sized sleep chambers. One was extra small and one was extra large.   *	*	*	Six months later	*	*	*  	The trip went perfectly to plan. The ship woke them up when it had landed on the pre-determined site - only a few miles from Mars’ polar ice caps. Kali and Eric quickly set to work. They threw on clean clothing and went to the cargo hold.  	The animals seemed fine. They hadn’t been taken out of their chambers and wouldn’t be for a few days. Their first task was to build and secure the greenhouse, as it would be their main source of food, air, living space and animal area. They had bought a special sealant that held air in and the thin carbon dioxide atmosphere out.  Carrying the parts of the greenhouse on their Segway scooters, they slowly finished it, working day and night. It was easily assembled, but the sealant was extremely hard to apply because it wouldn’t stick to the metal and glass in the lower gravity. Eventually they found that by applying sealant to some parts on the gravity controlled ship, it went on much better than outside. Because plants need carbon dioxide to live, the plants could easily start inside the green house that was full of Martian air. When the plants began growing, they would take in the carbon dioxide and give off breathable air for the settlers to breathe. None of this would be possible until the solar array was in place to power the grow lights and re-charge the Segway batteries.  *	*	*	Two Weeks Later	*	*	*  	The solar arrays were in place. The plants were started and growing nicely. The tools were stored inside of the green house along with the food and feed. The animals were free to roam around inside of the cargo hold, but the male and female rabbis were separated until the travelers were ready to set up the cages for the new rabbits.  Kali and Eric were able to use the cabin of the ship for living quarters, but didn’t do much living. They had to make sure that the chickens were properly fed so that they could produce eggs. They had to make sure that the air hoses from the green house were hooked up to the ship so that the ship wouldn’t run out of air.  Going to the polar ice caps every day was extremely important, because if they didn’t go, they would run out of water. The ice caps aren’t pure ice but have some water in them. Eric and Kali rode the scooters several miles every day to the ice caps, drilled the ice into chunks, and returned them to the ship. The chunks had to be melted and filtered. There wasn’t much yield though. After they got comfortable, they constructed the chicken coop and rabbit cages so that they animals weren’t running along the floors of the cargo hold. The goats had only a little room so Eric and Kali were able to fabricate one suit for them so they could be taken outside for exercise. Eventually the entire spaceship could be split from the cargo hold and moved directly to the ground, making it more accessible. Harvesting plants in the greenhouse was an easy way to get food. The chickens produced good eggs and many healthy chicks. The rabbits had no trouble adjusting to the Martian lifestyle; plenty of little thumpers were running all over. The cargo hold had leftover greenhouse windows added to it so that the animals could have more natural lighting. The rabbits could produce quickly so they were an excellent source of meat. The chickens and goats weren’t as bountiful, so they couldn’t be used as a source of food quite yet. The goats could produce fertilizer, which proved useful in their garden. Martian life seems hard, but it would be a wonderful home. Kali and Eric will have to live the rest of their lives on milk, meat, eggs and vegetables. But hey – it sure beats exploding!

      What do I think about Chinese character tattoos, stickers, and emblems? Read on for more...   Honestly, when I see any Chinese characters that are affixed, stuck, tatooed, or otherwise attached to a white guy or a white guy's property, I think "Asshole." Pure and simple.  "Do you know what that thing says?" "Na, bra, it looks cool though, don't it?" "It say's 'I prefer underaged boys to women my age', you prick!" "Ya, but it looks cool though, don't it?"  These stickers also appear on cars. Not your mom's Subaru Outback or your dad's Lincoln Town Car. The cars they appear on usually have a four foot wide sticker on the windshield proudly announcing the brand of their "ride" in some exotic font. The side usually has some extremely lame graphic, like a silver and blue eagle, or a golden sword - think "The Fast and the Furious". But they always manage to stick a character in for "Deadly Strike" or "Swift Claw" right above the gas cap.  I'm sick of this. It's not cool.  Less Chinese, sooner.

      After Recent Outcry about my Harry Potter Speculations I admit I was wrong. Harry's dad was not in Slytherin and Harry is not the half blood prince however there are several confirmed facts about the book and here they are straight from A mix of Harry Potter Fansites. All have been Confirmed from god herself J.K. Rowling. (Warning if u like to know absolutelly nothing about the next book&nbsp;DONT READ ON but these are very broad and most are to be assumed): Read on for more...  1. By the ends of books 6 and 7 "you'll have all the back story you'll need", says JK Rowling, and a prequel will not be necessary  2. There will be a new Minister of Magic, no more Mr. Fudge.  3. We will find out what happened to Hagrid's half brother Grawp. He will be a bit more controllable in book 6.  4. The Dursleys are in the next book, but Harry's stay with them will be the shortest yet. In book 5 he stayed for 4 weeks, so we know his stay will be less than 4 weeks.  5. Cho Chang will not be a romantic interest of Harry in Book 6, however there will be a "little romance" for Harry says JK.  6. In books 6 and 7 we will find out exactly why JK killed off Sirius.  7. Harry becomes even more powerful in book 6.  8. In books 6 and 7 we will find out why Dumbledore trusts Snape.  9. We will find out what happened to Wormtail AKA Peter Pettigrew  10. More about the animosity between Snape and Sirius will be revealed in the last 2 books.  11. JK has said that giving away the form of Snape's boggart and patronus says too much. We'll definitely find out what Snape's worst fear is, and it'll be important.  12. Hermione and Draco will NOT end up together in book 6 or 7.  13. We will find out what exactly Dudley saw when he looked at the dementors.  14. The reason Voldemort and Harry both didn't die when Voldemort tried to kill Harry, will be revealed.  15. We will see more of Draco's mother, Narcissa Malfoy, now that Lucius is busy.  16. We'll learn more about Harry's scar in the last 2 books.  17. Moaning Myrtle will make an appearance again, as will Tonks.  18. More about Voldemort's birth will be revealed, thus helping us understand why he is so evil.  19. Muggles begin to notice "more and more odd" occurrences in book 6, says JK.  20. The wizarding world is really at war in the sixth book.  21. Harry will tell his dearest friends about the prophesy after it sinks in to him.  22. We will learn more about Harry's relatives, including his grandparents (though JK says they aren't really important to the story)  23. We will find out what happened to Sirius's motorbike.  24. Book 6 will be shorter than the 5th book (or at least JK's 99% sure, but will not swear on her children's lives)  25. There will be no "new" nationalities of children at Hogwarts. Hogwarts is a British school, and JK says that adding foreigners for the sake of it is not in her plans.  26. During an interview, when JKR was asked in which Hogwarts room she'd like to be for 1 hour, she said it would be a room in which Harry has been before, but doesn't know its importance. Yet. (this could have happened in book 5, but we're unsure)  27. It's very important in the plot that Harry has his mother's eyes, and that her wand was very good for charms.  28. During an interview for Kids BBC, Victor Greensteet (reporter) asked Rowling if Harry would have a dragon for a pet. This is what she replied: "You can't tame a dragon, no matter what Hagrid thinks. It's simply impossible. So no. He has more common sense. He MAY have a different pet in the future, but for now, I won't say anything else". (This could have been buckbeak, but I'm sure we can expect more pets)  29. In the same interview for Kids BBC, the reporter asked J. K. if Harry had ever used the internet, and this is what she had to say: "No. They (the Dursleys) won't let him go near Dudley's computer, and Dudley is the only one who has a computer. They hit him if he gets too near to the keyboard. So the answer would be No. I use it a lot, but Harry doesn't. Wizards don't really need to go on the web. They have an even better way to find out what's happening in the outside world, which I think is a lot more fun than the Internet, but I'm going to keep quiet on this one."  30. The choice between what's right and what's easy will be a pillar of the plot in Harry's last 2 years at Hogwarts  31. Harry's parents' profession will be a big part of the plot.  32. Something HUGE will be revealed about Lily Potter.  POST MANY COMMENTS ON THESE AND TELL ERIC AND I WHAT U THINK OF OUR BLOG

      Squirrels. Read on...   I came to a realization. I have never seen squirrel poop - anywhere. For that matter, I've never seen a squirrel pooping. They eat quite a bit of food - nuts mostly, which are quite rich in fiber - and it must go somewhere. Let's just say that I want the poop on squirrels.   Less sooner.

      Welcome back, self. Why thank you, self! Read on...  I'm back from my Thursday to Monday stay in Rochester/Webster New York. I had a great time seeing friends and a greater time living it up, college (fake) style.  If you haven't heard, there is a great cartoon up over at  urlLink JibJab . I'm a little behind reporting this, but if you complain you probably won't be able to appreciate this masterpiece anyway. It's called "This Land is Your Land" and features such appearances as George W. Bush, John Kerry, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Bill Clinton. Watch it and revel in it's hilarity.   Less sooner.

      I had a little time to ponder Travis's "theories" about the upcoming Harry Potter book. Read on for more...  Is Harry Potter really the Half Blood Prince? No. In a post on her own site, J.K. Rowling  urlLink says  (last paragraph) it herself:  "I shall tell you one thing without making you shift any bricks at all: the HBP is neither Harry nor Voldemort. And that's all I'm saying on THAT subject until the book's published." HBP is the Half Blood Prince, by the way. Just to clear this up further, let's use method for solving systems in algebra to clear this theory up completly. If Harry Potter was the Half Blood Prince, substituting Harry Potter for the Half Blood Prince in the title might make sense. "Harry Potter and the Harry Potter" would be quite redundant. I'm sorry Trav, but this is one of those times that  you  are wrong.  Lol. Less posting about HP and the HBP, later.

      Oh. My. God. I'm gone for a few days and Travis can't even hold back the Harry Potter theories... This is ridiculous. Read on for more...  So I went to New York and I'm staying with my friends here. Two nights ago, I stayed over at the Rochester Institute of Technology. It was a great experience, one that I reccomend to all college bound students.  Anyway, I have a gripe I'd like to address.  PT Cruisers are a widespread infection in the United States. They, along with George W. Bush (as well as G.H.W. Bush), are the reason the world laughs at us, rather than with us.  I went out the other night with some friends and witnessed something truly scarring - a  convertable    purple   PT CRUISER. I though, "Shit, that can't get too much worse..." but then, "Shit, it's worse." There was a 65 year old man wearing a cotton t-shirt with the sleeves cut off, athletic shorts, and big, cop sunglasses. HE WAS EATING AN ICECREAM CONE.  His wife, or "lady" as I expect he calls her, sat there with a plaid sleeveless shirt, up-doo and a big-ass icecream cone.   The purpose of the PT Cruiser was to rekindle the passion teenagers had for funky, non-ricer cars during the surfer era. What it actually did was rekindle that same passion in the people that were actually  alive  during the surfer era. The same goes for the Honda Element, the Volkswagon Beetle, and and of the new cars in the Chevy line, because those look like the demon spawn of a PT Cruiser.   Please, less PT Cruisers, sooner. (Like now, actually...)

      Hey everyone  I just recentlly set the standard for reading the fifth Harry Potter Book in an evening. It was my 4th time reading it and consideriding it is 870 its was still as magical the 4th time. Read on for more...  Anyway news has reached me that the 6th Harry Potter book is to be titled "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince". As several people know I love to theorize what is gonna happen in the next harry potter book and I usually am right. I will not ruin the story for u but I will say what I believe the title to mean. Harry Potter is obviously the half blood prince. His mother was a muggle and his father a wizard making him half blood, But a prince what does this mean u may say. Well I will tell u exactlly what it means. Harry is a member of the Gryffindor house because they display bravery. But there is more to Harry's link to this house then meets the eye. Harry is infact the Heir of Gordric Gryffindor one of the original founders of Hogwarts. This is hinted throughout the series as harry pulled a sword belonging to Gordric out of the sorting&nbsp;in the 2nd book while fighting the Basalisk. Dumbledor then told Harry that only a true member of the Gryffindor House could have done that. This is an obvious connection but another that I have found is in the first or second book im not sure which they mention harry's parents lived in Gordrics Hallow obviouslly named after Godric Gryffindor. This would make Harry a prince in a way. There is one curveball to this and it is the fact that Harry's father was&nbsp; in Slytherin. Im not sure why I believe this but im pretty sure it is true.Anyway leave comments on harry potter and I will give More of my Theories. More entries Later... Peace Out !

      At this point, according to observers, both statesmen decided—by seemingly unspoken mutual consent—to abandon the gutter patois of the common carnival worker and to resort instead to an eminently more quotable (but, to those not versed in the vagaries of hip-hop idiom, more confusing) exchange of viewpoints.  “Oh, it’s like that?” Mr. Cheney queried. “Whut? Whut?” Mr. Leahy shot back. “Once again,” Mr. Cheney replied (quite obviously quoting a lyric from Ice Cube’s 1990 album, “AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted”), “ urlLink it’s on .”  Less Dick, Bush, and Colin, sooner.

      Okay readers. It's time I shook things up a little bit. I have some  fab  news. If you'd like to guesstimate (holy crap, my spell check knows that word...), be my  guess t... Get it?  Guess t? Yeah, well, go to hell.  Travis Harris, the jolly young man some of you may have  urlLink seen  with short hair, has signed on. I'd like to take this time to welcome him to the team, which is now completely devoid of "I." I'm sure having him here will, if anything, increase the posting output. YAY!  In other, more interesting news, I sat around the house today and did diddley squat.  Less nothing, sooner.

      Yesterday was  fan tastic.  I went with Noah, Travis, and Jon to see I, Robot. Get this - it was  better  than Independence Day. Wow. Most of the stuff that was  fan tastic shouldn't be posted on the internet.   Biatch! Less sooner.

      I went to the Kitchen Store today with my mother and brother. Here's the stuff we liked.   Next to the boy in the upper left, it says, "Now with FRUIT flavored markers!" What did they taste like before? And yes, that police car  is  a cookie.    Will found a +5 Iron Wisk in aisle 3.

      Readers: I almost killed myself by drinking two fluid ounces of straight espresso. However, I am grateful for what it has done. Now, when I eat foods that I used to hate, I can think of how bad that coffee tasted and keep on eating what ever it is I'm eating.  Flavor of espresso I just drank: rotten skunk vagina.  Less skunk, sooner. (Hopefully,  much  sooner)

      Ok. Here's something that has bothered me for a while. White men in their mid-twenties to early thirties who call other white men in the same age group "son" and wave their arms around and try to look crazy. If you were black, or not dressed in clothes you bought with your birthday money from grandma, I might let it slide. Once, I saw Derrick Shannon walking down the hall, dressed like he just came out of a Snoop Dogg video, with some girl. She  must  have said something that he liked, because all of a sudden, he starts saying, as loud as his pre-pubescent vocal chords will allow, "Yea, SON! YEA!" He paused here, and continued for dramatic effect, possibly hoping she would look at him and register that he was actually there, "SON!" If you are white, stop this now.  Less male children, sooner.

      Um... Yeah. So I updated the look. Why? 'Cause I was sick of the old one. This is my first post in quite a while, so I'm s-s-s-sorry. Yes. I'm sorry. I should be posting more stuff soon. Tonight, Siping and Noah are coming over. We'll probably play some DDR and watch a movie.  Travis cut his hair, and if I can, I'll post a picture of it. For now, I'll just say it's really short. Shockingly so.  Good story: Siping sang along to a techno song - something about "my little butterfly" - at 1:00 AM or so the other night. He was intoxicated. While listening, I zoned out. Moments later I was shocked upon opening my eyes to see Siping and not William Hung. Ok.  Less sooner.

      Okay. So. Fraydie.  Normally, Friday nights are planned by Noah. Friday nights usually go smoothly and everyone is home before 10:30. So I made the plans this week.  For a brief outline of Friday's events, read on...   To be totally honest, I had every reason to expect my plans to fail. After all, it's nothing new; my plans frequently fail due to poor judgement and lack of communication. This week was different.  I got to Travis's house about 5:00. We watched VH1 until at least 6:30, and left the house by 7:00 to pick up Kali and Mike. "Sweet," I think. Both Kali  and  Mike are going to be able to come. On an ordinary friday, neither would be able to come. So, aside from Travis nearly popping a tire on the curb outside of Kali's house, picking the two of them up  actually  worked.  AND  we got to the movie theater.   Early  . What were we there to see? Napoleon Dynamite. This movie surpassed all expectations I had for it - which were considerably high.  A must see.  After the movie, Chinese food was had by me and Travis while Kali and Mike looked on helplessly... ...at the TV.  Less posts written like I do nothing on Friday and end up deciding on Sunday that I need to post something after almost a week with nothing, sooner.
