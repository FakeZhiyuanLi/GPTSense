      Too bad my life doesn't have a reset button... If it had, now is one of those days i would really like to reset my whole life...  I am a very lonely person... It may seem that I have friends, but, are those friends of mine reliable in times of trouble? The answer is very obvious... It would be no... In this world, the hardest treasure to find is true friends that can be reliable even though you are in some kind of trouble... That was what one of my school teachers used to say... At that time, i did not really understood what it meant, but, now i finally understood what it meant... Most of my friends or maybe all of them make use of me... Like the come to my house to play my PS2 as they do not have... They do not really regard me as a friend, but as a tool for their own amusement... And, I hate these type of people...  So far today was boring as usual, but, my mum signed me up for some japanese lessons at a building near outram park MRT station... It cheered me up alot... I hope that I can take up japanese as an 'O' level subject if I do well in it... Then, I have a higher chance of passing my 'O' levels...   I really wonder if anyone comes to my blog... They web-counter shows 100+ people, but, none of them tagged... How sad....

      Today is a really boring day...   I just found out that i am almost broke... I guess that's the consequences of buying too much comics... My room is filled with a lot of comics... Some are quite old... But all are japanese manga... Buying comics is very addictive... But it's good... As, it makes you creative... I love to read mangaone of the reasons why i read them is because of it's storyline... Like 'Battle Royale' the manga for example... I don't buy it as it is abit sadistic, but I buy it because it has a very good storyline... BTW, it(the manga) is rated MATURE... Which is for ages 18 and above... For it's very sadistic scenes, and the language spoken by it's characters... In every book, someone will always say "FUCK!"... It is sadistic like the movie... There's a scene(in the movie) where a head was sliced of with sword... And the head was used as a weapon... That scene made me puked out my lunch... Anyway, the Battle Royale manga can be bought for S$20 a book(there are 14 books) at the shop ABSOULUTE COMICS in bugis... People who like to read manga published by Tokyo Pop should know where it is...  Today, my tuition class was very boring... We had a relieve teacher instead of the Mr. lu guy... The relieve teacher kept on talking in a very very monotonous tone... Most of us were damn bloody pissed... The guy beside my was pointing the middle finger at the teacher when she was writing on the board... We had another girl joined our class today... Finally, we had abit more girls joning our class... My class has 5 guys and 2 girls currently... All the guys are from all boys school... Which usually explains the excessive amount of dirty jokes in my tuition class...  There are a lot of things i don't wanna remember about today... So, this will be the end of this post...  I really wished that my life had a Reset button....

      Today is monday... The first day of the week...   The holidays are coming to an end soon... I did not do anything much during the holidays... There is just too much school work for me to do... The Design and Technology folio, the worksheets that are posted on the net... Too much homework... I really hate the school i m in right now... How i wish i can just do something about singapore's eduction system... I wish i can change it, so it will not be so stressful for everyone...

      today is the first time i m blogging here... i will use here as my blog from now on, as my website is kinda screwed up...   Today was quite boring and tiring though... I had to swim alot as part of my training... after swimming for about 2 hours without stopping, i felt dizzy... I still had to go to my aunt's house for dinner... It's so boring here in singapore... so small... so little places to go... all the things here also very expensive...   The holidays were very boring... I did the same thing everyday... First, i woke up, then i had breakfast, then i play my PS2 for very long till dinner because i skipped lunch... then, i watch tv at 9pm till 10pm, then, i play PS2 again till i feel like sleeping...   I finally managed to watch 'battle royale' the movie version... It is very sadistic... Very sick, very gross... But, very nice show... It is about a class of 15 year-olds getting selected for a 'population control' program called the 'battle royale system'. In this program, it is like a game. The winner gets to go home as the whole class is stranded on a deserted island. The rules of the game is very simple. It is kill or be killed. When the class of 40 reached the island, two other people joined them in the game. One of them joined to experience the 'joy' of killing, while the other one was drugged and brought to the island to make sure that the game goes as plan. The rest i cannot say... as it is either too sadistic or too gross... anyways, you should watch it as it is a very nice movie

      Frustration?  Is that what am I feeling right now?  Fakes?  Isn't that the thing that fills this world?  Real?  Aren't there too many fake stuff to differentiate which is real?  Happiness?  I don't believe in such a thing...  Peace?  Isn't that just a big lie that we tell ourselves?   Hope?  I don't think I have any...

      To me, my life is kinda meaningless... Everything that i do, will always be screwed up by me... I can't do anything right... I always end up asking myself,"Why am i living here? Why can't I just die?" And somewhere inside me will reply will always say,"You can't die now... Think about the people around you, what will happen to them if you die?"But, another part of me will reply,"They will rejoice and celebrate, so, why don't you just die? End all your misery and suffering..." And, I usually end up choosing to live... Just because of one reason... But, I won't say it out here, in this web log... If the person reading this wants to know the reason I choose to live, find out yourself...  I thought i was going to die today... After swimming today, I felt kinda dizzy... I felt like vomitting... I just told myself that nothing will happen, I am just making myself think i am dizzy... Then, I got on my dad's motorbike... The bike started moving abit, then, i really felt like vomitting... On the way back, I ask my dad to stop the bike, i felt damn dizzy... Then, i closed my eyes... When i opened them, I couldn't see a thing... Everything was also quiet... I think i also couldn't hear a thing... It was quite a scary experience... I kept on vomitting... Everything was white... couldn't see anything... This went on for about 10 minutes...   Anyway, I know i won't die that easily... But, i don't think anyone will care... I think I m going to the hospital now, to see the doctor, so, bye bye... Hope i may live to continue blogging...

      School is.... boring... horrible... scary... not a place i should be at...  Why am i here? Why we have school?  It's so DAMN stressful. If school is good for us, why so many people commit suicide because of it? We have a fucked up education system...   What to we wish to get after all this education? Do we really need to apply eveything we learn in school when we are out of school? What has A-maths gotta do with me if i wanna be a chef? What has chemistry gotta do with me if i wanna be some boss of some company selling comics?

       Your web browser may need the japanese language support to read the title. Please take note that all the vulgarities in this post have been censored     Another day has passed. And I got scolded again by Madam Phua. She is so damn pissed as I did not have my Design and Technology materials. So, I had a very fun time cleaning the Design and Technology lab. It was quite fun though. I get to take any materials that were lying around the floor. But, luckily I did not get caught by Mdm Phua. Mdm Phua is a bitch. Just because she is pregnant, she thinks that she can show us attitude. Anyway, I am quite pissed with that f***ed up attitude of hers. I always had this temptation to kick that f***ing belly of hers and make her have a miscarriage. Design and Tech can be a fun subject, but, school teachers make the subject boring. I don't really know what is wrong with all the teachers. They think that because I had a very bad record last year, I won't change this year. They keep thinking that I am the boy I was last year, but infact, I am trying to change, bit by bit. Anyway, no one cares if I change or not.    In school, everyone is starting to hate A-maths. It's not because of the subject, but because of the teacher. We have one hell of a slacker for a teacher. He doesn't even know how to teach. That explains the number of failures for this year's mid year exams. The teacher, Mr. Soh, is also the Head Of Department for maths. No one knows how a slacker like him can get into such a high paying rank. He is not fit to teach. He insults almost everyone for no reason. He thinks he is perfect. And, he is damn racist. I think the racial harmony shit didn't get to him. He is on f***ing son-of-a-b****. Now, Marco, Wei Min, Khai Wah and Ernest Lee wants to drop A-maths to take Principals of Accounts. All because of the screwed up teacher. If only we could do something about that son-of-a-b****. Everyone hopes that he gets sacked from teaching. Too bad we can't do anything as he is the Head of Department for maths. Which means, he is in charge of all the maths stuff in my school. That includes tests, exams, worksheets, etc.    I've decided to make a few resolutions. As I think that I really need to change for the better.  My Resolutions:  Refrain from using too much vulgaities. Use only in emergencies.  Save at least $2 a day. So that I can use the money I save to buy certain stuff.  Talk lesser everyday. Talking lesser won't kill.  Stop imitating teachers. Imitating teachers get me into trouble.  Control my anger. Controlling my anger helps me alot by not getting me into trouble

      God is great. He created us. We should be grateful. But, we do we deface the world he has created? We humans are selfish creatures. We deface God's creation to suit our needs. By doing so, we show that we do not care about what the Almighty God has given us. We only care about our survival. Fortunately, we have a forgiving God. He forgives us even though we sinned against him. But, sometimes I wonder, if we deserve his forgiveness? Are we grateful for what he has done for us? I too have sinned against him. I know that I have committed many sins. But, I want to repent. Too bad there is no space for repentance in this cruel world. Many people around us cannot accept the fact that one has repented. They just keep on reminding themselves of what evil things that person has done in the past, and always doubting whatever he says. This is also part of human nature. What is the true meaning of Humanity anyway? I think it's meaning is forever changing. Can we call ourselves human when we kill in wars? Can we call ourselves human when we destroy God's creation? I think we deserve to be punished by God.     Anyway, about today. I had quite a terrible day. It's a miracle i can still be happy about it. Firstly, my handphone and mp3 player got confiscated by Miss Chan, my geography teacher. Then, I had a very long lesson of A-maths. My handphone to me is very precious. It's like my personal assistant. It keeps track of all the important things I need to do, the important dates that I tend to forget. But, it got confiscated. All thanks to Mr. Nicholas Han. He is just one bored guy who has nothing better to do. As usual, I was playing with my headphones in class, I put the over my ears, as though I was listening to music. And my mp3 player was turned on to record the day's geography lesson. Miss Chan saw me playing with my headphones, and thought I was listening to music. She ask me to hand her the mp3 player. It was under my desk. Then, I told miss Chan that I was only playing with the headphones, but then, all of a sudden, Mr Han had to open his mouth and said that I had the mp3 player under my desk. So, Miss Chan asked me to hand her the mp3 player or I have to eat rubbish. I told her that I would gladly eat rubbish instead of handing the mp3 player over to her. So, I stood up and walked towards her. She walked to my table and checked under my desk. She found nothing. But then, the guy who cannot shut his mouth, said that the mp3 player was in my pocket. So, Miss Chan asked me to empty my pockets. Then, she saw my handphone and mp3 player. She took both away. I was very angry at first, but, I remembered that someone told me that God is a forgiving God. So, I knew that I had to forgive. In the end, I found out that forgiving is much more better than holding a grudge against that guy. When you hold a grudge inside of you, you keep the anger inside of you. Which is very bad. Anyway, I've decided to look on the brighter side of life. At least my things that were confiscated were in good hands. It's still better than getting it stolen. When it's stolen, you know that no one is going to return it back to you, but, when it's confiscated, you will always know that you will get it back someday or another.     I know that people are laughing at me right now, but I don't really care. When they laugh at me, I will also laugh with them. I will not hold a grudge against anyone. As I have to forgive them, like God forgave us of all our sins.   But, the sad fact of life is that I don't really have any friends. I guess that's the result of my attitude problem. I know that I have to change, but it's hard to change. Anyway, living life without any friends seems alright to me. But, in the end, I still have to change.

      Some guy(s) from St Andrews 3ST have made a new discovery...  It is a new species of irritants called the pussyfish. It is labelled so, as it was originated from the jellyfish species.It is called pussyfish, as it wobbles, it is spineless, and it is one big fat hell of a pussy... A pussy is a term to describe a guy that has no balls... Pussyfishes can be found sucking up to people, they have long heads, and they claim themselves to be 'very handsome and socialble'. Pussyfishes also have very very white skin. It turns red when exposed to the sun. Pussyfishes are made up of 90% water, 10% shit, that is why they are irritating. When pussyfishes are in trouble, they run home to their mothers and complain to their mothers, that's one of the reasons why they are spineless. Another reason why they are spineless, is because they tend to depend on people for EVERYTHING, including games, homework, etc. Pussyfishes are easily agitated, you can agitate them by saying to it 'wobble' or 'pussyfish'. They are currently a closely monitored species, as they may pose a threat to the whole of humanity by disgracing it. Pussyfishes like to make empty threats. So, do not be afraid when a pussyfish says 'I'm gonna whack you!', because, it will never whack you. It 'fights' by only pushing you, thinking that by pushing you, you will get hurt greatly. But, do not fight back with a pussyfish, as it will run home to his mother and complain. To defend yourself against pussyfishes, you must need a pussyfish repellent. You can get one by telling an adult that you are being physically/mentally/sexually harrassed by a pussyfish. When you encounter with a live pussyfish, all you have to do is to tell it to fuck off. Then, ask it to wobble away. Pussyfishes have a strange desire to do the 'pussyfish/jellyfish dance'. They do so by standing up and wobbling. To see a live video of the pussyfish dance, you can order it from Dominic Ho.    Lastly, BEWARE OF PUSSYFISHES, as they are bigtime pussies  Current pussyfishes: EUGENE TAY XUE WEI

      It's kinda like a normal day today... Except for the chemistry lesson in class. Everyone was doing whatever we wanted to in the chemistry lab. I made weird liquids in test-tubes, while Khai Wah made a 'flash bang'. He took 6 strips of magnesium and tied them to a stick. Then he lighted the magnesium strips. The strips glowed so brightly that it attracted everyone. Soon, everyone started copying what he did. Then there was Jesse. He lit a magnesium ribbon, and passed it to Bertrand. Bertrand was playing a fool, so he took the lighted magnesium and swing it around in the air. The burning magensium ribbon broke away from the stick, and landed on Bertrand's hair. His hair was burning and he didn't notice it until 10 seconds later. The whole class was laughing away... But, it ain't funny, if your hair caught fire. Then, Chem Yeo, the teacher, got angry and shouted at the class, yadda yadda yadda... Same old story as always... Ending up getting scolded, bla bla bla....    In life, we gotta lose something to gain something... We may also lose our lives and gain popularity... Isn't it weird? We always gotta lose something, before we get something... That's always the case... Cruel life....

      Sad... For no obvious reason... Depressed... As usual... Had DnT today... Damned pissed as usual. Just because of the DnT teacher... So damn irritating... I've gotta refrain from using vulgarities. It's bad for my health... Gotta change... Even though no one cares, I still gotta change.     No one cares... I'm always lonely... Isn't lonliness a good thing? People around me pretend to care. I don't know why they pretend to care. But, it's so fake. Why don't everyone stop caring? It's hurting me from the inside... All those lies that cloud my mind. I can't differentiate the truth from lies... There are just too many lies inside of me... Don't you all hate me? Then, why still act as though you care? Don't you get sick and tired from acting? You all are just a bunch of liars... I don't wanna hate you, but... I have no choice if you want to carry on your act... Why don't you all just say that you hate me? Isn't it much easier? Isn't it much better? Stop your act...

      Nothing much happened today. Except that I had an extremely easy english test. I also had one very tiring Physical Education(PE) lesson. I had to complete the whole test including the 2.4 km run. It really sucked. Then we had chemistry lessons and  then Design and Technology lessons. The DnT lessons pissed me off because of the bias teacher. She thinks that just because she is pregnant, she own the world. Anyway, today was fine.

      Today was quite a good day for me. I passed my swimming exams even though I thought that I was going to fail. I thought I was going to fail at the last part of the test. I had to swim 30 laps in 3 different styles and in 45 minutes for the last part of the exam. I thought I could not make it, as I usually take more than 45 minutes to swim the 30 laps. After the examiner told me that I passed, I was overjoyed. But, then, I felt very dizzy. I usually feel dizzy after swimming without warming up first. Then, I celebrated at Sakae Sushi.     But, I also found out that the terrorist problem in Singapore is getting out of hand. It is said that some terrorist planted bombs in some train stations around Singapore. That is quite scary! Everyone used to think that Singapore is a very safe country. But, I found out that there are many flaws in the security system in many train stations in singapore. Singapore is not safe anymore. All because of some people.    Humans are fragile...

      I feel kinda weird these days... I feel so damn tired... I don't know why, but I also don't feel like talking to anyone... But I just force myself to act as if nothing has happened... I know the people around me are not people I can trust, so, why I should I tell them how I feel? I also know that they don't even care about how I feel. They just care about themselves. I remember a teacher of mine once said that we got to have other people to support us, as we are human beings. We cannot support ourselves. We need the help and support from our friends. But, who are my friends? I used to lie to myself that I have some friends I can trust. But, I found out that when you are really in trouble, no one's going to help you. There's only one choice. It's to face the problem myself. I used to treat this person as my friend, but, he only cared about himself. He didn't even helped me when I was in trouble. And the problem I was facing was very big. He could've helped me out, but, he just turned his back on me. So, I don't really trust anyone now...  Someone once said about how people act differently in front of their friends. I find it very true, as it also applies to me. I talk a lot of rubbish in front of my friends. I act lame in front of my friends. But, I keep to myself when my friends are not around. I have to put on an act when my friends are around. This applies to many people. I think it's just because we're afraid of people seeing our true selves. But, I've found out that the more we put on an act, the more we become afraid of showing others what we really are like. We are afraid that when we show our true selves, no one will accept us. I too am afraid of people seeing another side of me. I can do nothing but to carry on the act. But, do we really have to put on an act? I feel that the more I continue this act, the more I lose myself. I'm beginning to forget who I really am. Sometimes, I just cry in pain, in a cold dark corner. But, no one even cares. No one can be bothered with me. To me, I feel that I've got no purpose in life. I'm just an empty soulless shell, wandering the earth. Anyway, no one really cares, no one will care. I've really got no future. Everyone hates me. I'm just an obstacle to everyone... I should just go far away from everyone and die... Even if I die, no one will remember me. Not even my parents...   I have many regrets in life. One of them is staying alive...

       I wake up from a nightmare now In the day it haunts me It slowly tears me apart With dreams of a distant love I'm a wandering satellite  Somewhere in the wasteland I see you smiling at me A vision out of my dreams Will everything change ? Take the pain away Lead me with your light  Heading for the sun Leave the sadness behind Crossing oceans dry Yeah  My world spining out of time Won't somebody stop me ? I may be losing my way Will you make it right ? Take the pain away Hear me as I cry  Heading for the sun Leave the sadness behind Crossing oceans dry Deep inside I go  The Spirit dreams inside...  What can I do, I ask ? There's nothing left to say What can I do, I ask ? There's nothing left to say Why am I here ? Why am I lost ? Where is love ? Lead me with your light  Heading for the sun Leave the sadness behind Crossing oceans dry Deep inside I go Heading for the sun Leave the sadness behind Crossing oceans dry Deep inside I go  The Spirit dreams inside...

       There may be some offense material in this post   Life is quite good today... Nothing much happened... But I really can't understand why some people enjoy talking behind people's backs. And when someone talk behind their back, they act as though they did not talk behind that person's back. There's this person I know who does this. He's this irritating guy that does not know when to ask the appropriate question. He thinks that only people can owe him things, but he cannot owe people things. He can lie to you and still say he is testing you. If you are this specific person, and you are reading this, I know you will talk bad about me behind my back more. I just don't want to put down your name down here, as I am not like you. You think that you are great, but in fact, you are not. Someday, you will be very disappointed in yourself. You are just a coward. If you want to insult, or disturb someone, just do it in front of him. If you do it behind his back, it only shows that you are one big coward. Don't think that I do not know what you are doing. I'm just keeping quiet.  Sometimes, human nature confuses me. Why do we make something bad look as though it is something good in front of our friends? I know this guy from my class, he thinks surfing pornographic material is something to be proud of. He just wants to be accepted into the group of people sitting around him. But, even the guy that he wants to befriend said, 'Surfing porn isn't something you should be proud of. It's bad.' But the guy that wants to be accepted continued bragging about the pornographic material. Porn is something bad. But it is something very addictive, just like drugs. It harms you, just like drugs. But it harms you spiritually and mentally. Unlike drugs which harm you physically. Porn contaminates your mind. It makes you lust after sex. When you view too much porn, all you can think of is sex, whenever you look a the opposite sex. It's bad and it harms your social life. When you cannot fulfil that lust for the opposite sex, that lust will change into lust of the similar sex or even the strong desire to do 'it' with animals. This is when porn really harms your life. I know of some people who are really willing to give up the habit of surfing porn, but they just can't. It's just to addictive for them. But, only God can help them....

      I've found truth to be I've found rivers there and the world keeps on spinning, round and round so I lay still and wait  will we ever have the words will we ever meet again all the worries, will slip right away  and even through, all of the clouds disguise the sky and the reasons aren't clear why  when will we ever find clues to guide us? where will we ever find words at all?  I've found it hurts in here I've found space to feel and the world keeps on spinning, round and round so I lay still and wait  will we ever have the words will we ever know the pain? will we ever be back there again?

         Friends? I've only got one... He's God... But, some people say, 'there is no God'... Is it really true? Is there God? I believe God exist somewhere. Even though it may be in our hearts and minds, but I am sure God exist somewhere... There's always God... But, why do people don't believe that God exist? Why do they question his existance? Why do they make wild assumptions of how they were created? Is this what we should do? We doubt the one who created us... Is that what we are meant to be? We are made to destroy what God has created. That is what I see in this world today. But God forgives... Right?    We destroy as we are afraid. That's human nature. When we are afraid of something, we either join it or destroy it. We destroy ourselves, does that mean we are afraid of ourselves? We hate ourselves, don't we? We just don't want to admit it... Some of us think of ourselves as greater than others, but they are just escaping from reality. They claim that they are either very handsome or very strong, but, in fact, they will be very disappointed in themselves when they find out the real truth. We are just creatures that don't want people to think of us as inferior. Therefore, pride is something all of us have. It's just like smoking... It's addictive, and fun. But, it's very harmful... It evens harms us without us knowing... We have to learn to be humble. Pride is a disease that all humans have... Only God has the cure...      You're the disease, I'm the cure

      Life is kinda short... You can be dead in a blink of an eye... It's kinda scary though... This only shows that we are such fragile creatures. I witnessed an accident today... I saw this old lady. She was crossing the road after doing her marketing. Then, in the middle of the road, a speeding taxi zoomed passed. There was this loud screeching sound of the tyres... Then, there was this loud BANG!, followed by the sound of a dead body hitting the floor... Even though in the midst of the traffic, everything seems kinda quiet... For a moment, everyone stopped... On the floor, the old lady was dead. With her head facing the sky... Then, the taxi sped off... I immediately called the ambulance. From this, we can see that we are such fragile creatures. In a blink of an eye, we may be dead. It also shows that we are such self-centered creatures. We only care about our own well-being. Just like the taxi driver and his passengers who sped off. They could have helped by checking if the old lady was still alive or not, but, they just sped off. Thinking of only themselves. Is this what we should really be? Is this what God created us to be? Humanity itself is full of flaws...  What I wish for now is to be able to sleep without having any nightmarish dreams. I saw how a person died today. It's not like watching the television, as it is the real thing. I really wished that I did not see that incident today. It just keeps on replaying in my mind. It won't stop. I really wish that it would just stop... I wish that it would all just go away... I wished that it would just leave me alone... go away...    They can have my gun when they pry it from my cold dead fingers...

      Love unfailing Overtaking my heart You take me in Finding peace  again Fear is lost in all You are  And I would give the world to tell  You're story Cause I know that You've called me I know that You've called  me I've lost myself for good within Your promise I won't hide it I  won't hide it  Jesus, I believe in You And I would go to the ends of  the earth To the ends of the earth For You alone are the Son of God And  all the world will see That You are God You are God.

      Today is my country's National Day. But, I feel that today is just like another ordinary day. I don't really know why, but, when I was small, the national day festivity and celebrations made me feel as though that National Day is one special day. But, as I grow older, National Day seems to be just another ordinary day without school. As I see the National Day Parade beind shown on my television screen, I feel that it's just a replay of the previous years' parades. It's kinda meaningless, repeating the same message again and again every National Day. Why don't they just play a replay of last year's parade? The parade makes Singapore seem like a country with an intresting history, and a country filled with intresting people. But, I think that there's nothing intresting about Singapore. I wonder how can people love a country full of posers? I know myself that even though I'm a Singaporean, I hate Singapore. It's filled with a lot of self-centred people. A land filled with inconsiderate people. I say so because, I remember that when most of us were very young, we were taught only to care about ourselves. We were taught by our parents, caretakers, grandparents, aunts and uncles, babysitters to only care about ourselves. When people are in trouble, we must walk away as though nothing has happened. This is what most of us were taught. This is what I was taught.  I wonder if we can spot our own flaws. I know this person from my class, he likes to spot flaws of other people and make fun of them. But, he cannot spot his own flaw. When people try to tell him what's wrong with him, he doesn't even bother to change. I used to treat this person as a friend, until I found out how irritating and hateful he can be. He is insensitive to other people's feelings, he only cares about himself. He loves to make fun of people behind their backs. I really hate him. But, I just don't want to show it. He is just so damn fucking irritating. But, a lot of people are his friends. They just don't see the other side of him.He makes use of everyone around him. Some of us hate him, but, we don't show it. W hate him just because of the fact he makes use of everyone around him. He doesn't give a fuck about how others feel. So, we don't give a fuck about him. We just pretend to be his friend.
