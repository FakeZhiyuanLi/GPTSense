      Never mind that I was referred to as "a spare tire on someone else's bike that occasionally peddled past" on the blog of the guy who I grabbed a beer with last night ( urlLink http://www.aberranttemplar.blogspot.com )...  I really don't like Celebrity.  That's not to say I don't like celebrities...heck, I don't really know any.  I am a firm believer in Ellen DeGeneres' quote in the movie  EdTV , which says something like  People used to be famous for being special, now it seems Ed is special because he is famous .  This has a point, and I'm getting to it, so hang with me...  I listened to a Wayman Tisdale CD in Borders today while I was waiting for the dudes at Best Buy (not the hot chicks they always seem to hire as cashiers - the tech dudes) to check out my brand new computer to make sure it works okay.  Let me tell you this...Wayman Tisdale, a former NBA player, is no bass-playing savant.  This comes about 6 months after I heard some Bernie Williams, who is the centerfielder for the New York Yankees.  These guys are praised in the sports world for being so diverse and having other talents and skills etc.  Guess what, though?  These guys suck.  I mean, they're not terrible musicians, not that I can tell, but they basically play    Official Athlete Brand Elevator Music.     If you've ever stopped by a display of those "Sounds of Nature" CDs and listened to one or two of the 20 samples they have, where some cheeseball guitar slides into the foreground and starts noodling for a while, you've heard what these remarkably revered icons of sport and jazz are doing with their time.  Again, we're raving about these guys, not because they are good musicians, but because they are celebrities who play music.   This is nothing like Eddie Murphy singing some terrible 80's music or Shaquille O'Neal and Deion Sanders (and 100 other black athletes) floundering at rap.  These are guys who get lauded all over the place as "real musicians", but only because they play instruments instead of singing.  The effect is still the same.  It's like Martha Stewart trying to expand her horizons to be on CourtTV.  It doesn't work.  Don't believe the hype.

      This will be a rant tonight regarding ESPN's fascination with Kobe Bryant.&nbsp; I'm sorry, let me get it out of the way that the guy is an alright basketball player.&nbsp; As far as absolute skills translated across generations, he's as good as anyone in NBA history.&nbsp; For his time, though, the guy is an outright dud.&nbsp; Over the course of his post-Jordan career, we've watched the NBA fade into oblivion.&nbsp; He has done nothing that has made the world sit up and take notice.&nbsp; Only in the past year has the LeBron James hype machine managed to do anything to make the average American care about the NBA again.&nbsp; ESPN has Kobe's rape charge as the 7th biggest sports news story of the past 25 years, but no one cares.  Let's not stop there, though.&nbsp; I want to hit him up for infidelity.&nbsp; If you don't care about Kobe Bryant's infidelity, rape or not, I really don't need to hear your opinion.&nbsp; It can't be that hard not to cheat on your wife, unless you are culturally immune to the egregiousness of that error.&nbsp;  &nbsp;To top it off, we all figured out in a day that the Lakers were going after Kobe and Kobe only, getting rid of Phil Jackson and Shaquille O'Neal (SHAQ, to those who don't know his full name).&nbsp; It was a simple, cut and dried case that merely needed to wait for a deadline before it could happen.&nbsp; During that wait period, however, I had to see my SportsCenter or whatever other ESPN program it was interrupted by "news" about Kobe Bryant.&nbsp; I'm just glad they didn't cover the Tour de Lance, else it would have been the Tour de Kobe.&nbsp; Every five minutes the special Kobe correspondent (a guy who was allowed to co-host Pardon The Interruption despite the fact I can't remember his name) would deliver "breaking news" about Kobe.&nbsp; So glad the Outdoor Life Network, or whatever it is called, had European announcers, actually calling the race instead of trying to be funny, instead (Howie Day, Terry Bradshaw, and Dennis Miller will get their own rant on another day).  ESPN, why are you so fascinated with this infidel?&nbsp; Let it go.&nbsp; No one cares.

      soon, all of our words will look like this.&nbsp; hybrids.&nbsp; then they will become entities in and of themselves.&nbsp; then they will all become the same word.&nbsp; wait, this was supposed to be about the election in 2004, not the book 1984.&nbsp; anyway...  &nbsp;  you're either voting to kill babies or kill arabs.&nbsp; seriously.&nbsp; this is my rationale.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  i am adamantly pro-choice.&nbsp; fetuses are babies.&nbsp; they're not just fetuses.&nbsp; people want to kill babies and i don't.&nbsp; i want people to choose not to have sex before they are ready for babies.&nbsp; if they do choose to have sex, i want them to use condoms, pills, and the patch.&nbsp; that's 4 strikes and you're out.&nbsp; plenty of places in there to choose not to have a baby, okay?  &nbsp;  arabs are people.&nbsp; they're not just "the enemy".&nbsp; ask timothy mcveigh.&nbsp; i may or may not be a big fan of the war in iraq.&nbsp; i'm not there, so i don't know.&nbsp; two reasons to vote bush:  &nbsp;  1) let him finish it.&nbsp; he can't do it again without getting ousted and killed.&nbsp; we yank 'em all out not and it'll be worse than ever for the iraqi people.  2) we kill more babies than iraqis.  &nbsp;  vote bush for less dying.&nbsp; that's all i want out of a president.&nbsp; less dying.&nbsp; how about you?

      Legally, people can do whatever they want to do to themselves.  If a guy wants to use plastic surgery to turn himself into a lizard, be my guest.  You want cancer and STD's?  Go ahead and smoke after unprotected sex with a stranger.  It's your prerogative to live in pain or die young.  Just because you're allowed to make your own decisions, doesn't mean every decision you make is the right one.  We get stuck in our thinking, though, when we mix the individual's legal imperative with our theologically (or personally) based morals.  There are several actions allowable under the law that I don't agree with.  I don't think people are born gay, nor do I wish to accept or celebrate that lifestyle.  Legally, you can decide to quit you job even if you don't have another one lined up.  Legally, you can shout at your spouse relentlessly until they gain the courage to divorce you.  Legally, you can get a divorce.  It's not just what might be called the "big things", though.  The "hot-button" issues.  Forget that.  Decisions can go all the way down to how much time you should spend studying for a test or whether you should offer someone gas money on a long trip if you fought on the trip and aren't friends anymore.  Based on the global circumstances surrounding any given decision, there is one course of action that will be better than the other.  It's up to the individual to decide A or B.  Don't, however, assume that everyone is always doing what's right for them.  Don't console people after they've made a terrible decision and try to make them feel good about themselves.  In our touchy-feely world, we are not forced to own up to our mistakes and learn from our errors.  We're not even forced to consider that we have, in fact, made errors in judgment or action.  All we have to do is watch other people issue formal apologies that they themselves do not even believe.  Face it, chump.  You're dumb enough to make a lot of mistakes.  We, as human beings, are not too bright.  We are, however, smart enough to learn from our mistakes and not gloss over them with 21st-Century "I'm okay, you're okay" crap.

           As every beginning signals the dawn of a demise, so arises the weblog of The Boo Guy.  If anything, content will be varied.  I may release some old short stories I've written.  I may get around to writing some new ones.  I'd love to say something like "get theological on your ass", but there's way too much wrong with that sort of a statement.  Believe me, if there's a way to make writing about fantasy baseball interesting to those who are otherwise uninterested in baseball (fantasy or otherwise), this is the place you'll find it.  Much of the surrounding circumstances for this beginning come from my desire to put something out there that tells people what's going on with me so I don't have to be bothered doing it 100 times a week.       I will talk about everything, make fun of anything, and no matter how offended you'd originally think you were supposed to be, I'll win you over.  I'm not talking gross-out jokes, rebel yells, or outright bigotry here.  Those things are for Culture to talk about.  I am not Culture, nor am I Counter-Culture.  I'm simply telling you all the things you knew to be true but forgot somewhere along the way because you watch cable television.       To finish this out, I'd like to remind you that sentences start with a capital letter, spelling counts, and paragraphs are to be indented exactly 5 spaces.  This doesn't mean I'll follow any of the rules.  I'm a huge fan of run-on sentences and don't much care for the 5-space indentation aesthetically.  I will keep you entertained.  That is my promise.

      I've been reading a couple of books lately that have gotten me on to thinking about the subject of old people and nursing homes.  Then I went to see my paternal grandparents today, and the issue blew full wide on the car trip home.  Here's the thing about old people we all need to remember:  They're old.  Of course they're going to be a pain.  Not that my grandparents are a pain to me, yet, because they're not.  My dad, who's retired now, goes down to Little Falls (a sleepy little Mohawk Valley town) at least once a month to check on them, take them out to lunch, take them to the hospital for this or that procedure, whatever...but he doesn't hate it.  Not at all.  Old people need to be revered.  In this land where we have plastic surgeries to cure every sign of oldness among the middle-aged crowd, oldness is looked at as an irritation.  We put old people out to pasture in nursing homes that give them a very low quality of life, no matter how hard the staff works at it, until they eventually fade away and die.  I hate to bring Brave New World into this, but they made it so people never had to deal with death and dying people, and if we're not careful, we're headed in the same direction.   Old people need to live with their children and grandchildren once they can no longer take care of themselves.  If that means somebody has to start staying home (God forbid they do that to raise their children, who are being raised less and less) and take care of them, then do that.  These are the people responsible for you being here.  Family is the most important thing in the world, and if you don't have one, I'm sorry.  I'm not going to beat around the bush and try to make everyone feel good about all their decisions or circumstances.  I don't do that.  I like to talk about the way things should be.  You need to take care of your old people so they can live a full life until they die.  That's what you're here for.  You'll be old one day, too, and you'll hate the idea of a nursing home.  Old people don't want to be with other old people so much as they want to see young people, people still full of life, people who remind them what being alive is all about.   I love my grandparents, had a great time with them today on their 58th anniversary, and hope that if one of them passes on or they can't quite take care of themselves anymore, I'll be there for them, and not just to visit them every once in a while at some home for the soon-to-die.  No putting people out to pasture for me, thanks.  Books to read about this:   Brave New World,  by Aldous Huxley    Aloft,  by Chang-Rae Lee    Choke,  by Chuck Palahniuk (only if you have a high tolerance for sex and vulgarity)

      Normally, I don't much like being a quitter.&nbsp; I quit soccer at age 5 because I thought other kids, who had already played 2 years, had already progressed too far for me.&nbsp; I quit baseball because my crazy private school in 4th grade told me I couldn't play with "sinner" kids because I might go to hell.&nbsp; I quit basketball in 11th grade because the varsity coach was a jerk who happened to get fired the following year.&nbsp; I've quit 4 restaurant jobs (two of them twice).&nbsp; I quit teaching 8th grade math after a half a year.&nbsp; If there's a legacy in my life, it's that I quit things.&nbsp; I quit because they get difficult and irritating.&nbsp; I figure I'm good at so many things, I can afford to quit one of them.&nbsp; Well, I've been trying to reverse that trend lately, but not in this...  I've quit buying refurbished computers and trying to home-build computers.&nbsp; It's just not worth it.&nbsp; I can do a lot, really get close, but it's just not worth the hassle.&nbsp; I see so many people, most people, who get by with store-bought Windows (non-Linux) machines.&nbsp; I've been using my parents' for the past 2 months because&nbsp;I can't get my stupid thing to work.&nbsp; Come to think of it, in the past year I have had about 6 months of use out of my own computer, and that hasn't even been that good.&nbsp; I was still using a decrepit 13" monitor that was a little too dark.&nbsp; I was on Linux, which, try as they may, my computer geek friends have not been able to convince me is easy to use or as accessible as Windows.&nbsp; So, I'm done.&nbsp; Tomorrow, I'm going to go buy a $540 package computer/monitor/printer from Best Buy.&nbsp; I'm peddling the last of my $400 or $500 junk-build-computer for $84.99 on eBay ( urlLink http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=3495622863 ).&nbsp; Here's to happy new computing, a sight I haven't seen since I graduated college.&nbsp; Onward and upward!!!

      I have a job.&nbsp; It's not much of a job, but it's a job, and it rakes in the same neighborhood as a decent entry-level position.&nbsp; For all the boring reasons, I'm getting fed up with working in the restaurant.&nbsp; The manager cuts the floor too early, all the garnishes and dressings get put away, I have to make my own salads, I have to make my own make-your-own pizzas for kids, essentially running around like a maniac every few days for what amounts to an extra twenty bucks.&nbsp; It sucks, and I can't get out of closing, ever, because no one else there WANTS to do it.&nbsp; I don't really want to do it, but those are the breaks.   I almost went out looking for a job the other day, but I wasn't up to it because I spent 5 hours demolishing my computer's software system.&nbsp; I have nothing left and need to start from scratch.&nbsp; No music, no Word files, nothing.&nbsp; It sucks.&nbsp; By the time 7 o'clock rolled around and I was supposed to go to a real estate seminar, at the end of which they try to sign you up for $1000 classes, I decided I was more in the mood to spend waaayy too much money on shrimp, steak, and a movie.&nbsp; Good news is, I just got e-mailed a job from Monster.com.&nbsp; Bad news is, I probably won't even look into it.&nbsp; Ah well.     bonus material:&nbsp;    I now have a time and place set for meeting with the local leader guy (and friend of mine), Nathan Gunn, about doing Young Life.&nbsp; Unfortunately for me, it's Aug 19-20 in Saranac Lake, NY if I want to go.&nbsp; Otherwise I have to wait a few more weeks.&nbsp; What do you think I'll do?   put it off?&nbsp; probably not.&nbsp; I like Saranac too much to put off the opportunity to go up there and put miles on my lease car.&nbsp; Man, those miles are going to kill me.&nbsp; Ah well.

      The concert,&nbsp;I rode to.&nbsp; Lately, though, I've been fixated on running.&nbsp; By running I mean distance running and not sprinting.&nbsp; I've never been a runner in my life, save for playing some organized basketball about 10 years ago.&nbsp; I'm 25 now and decided I'm going to run a 5k or die trying.&nbsp;  &nbsp; You see, in America, we are fascinated by the instantaneous burst of quality and the crafted hand-eye skill in athletics, not events that require longevity and durability.&nbsp; This is why Michael Phelps lost an ESPY to Eric Gagne.&nbsp; Phelps set 5 swimming records in one meet.&nbsp; Forget that the guy even owns 5 records of any sort.&nbsp; HE GOT THEM ALL IN ONE MEET!&nbsp;  &nbsp; Gagne, on the other hand, is semi-famous for having closed 84 consecutive baseball games.&nbsp; While Gagne's streak is longer (for those of you who might object to my reasoning), the strain put on his body is for about 10 pitches, twice a week.&nbsp; It's the instantaneous 100mph burst we are fascinated with, not stroke-after-stroke-after-stroke of the pink stuff. &nbsp; I have cast my lot not with the skill players, but with the endurance players.&nbsp; My whole life has been a tribute to huge potential, and now I'm starting to go after something that anyone can do.&nbsp; It just requires hard work.&nbsp; Hopefully this will set my life on a new course, placing work above potential. &nbsp; Oh, and about that concert, it was Blues Traveler, IN A NIGHTCLUB, and it was the best show I've ever seen.

      Well, it's been a couple of days, and I'm still in the dregs of the every day life.&nbsp; Except for this:  &nbsp;  My Plan To Get Out Of Here.  &nbsp;  There are several ways in which I might find my way to a real job and a more stable life.&nbsp; Right now I'm still working at the Uno restaurant, which I refuse to call the Chicago Grill because I still remember it as Pizzeria Uno and don't care to eat anything other than the pizzas on my break.&nbsp; The continually changing day off and constant closing shifts that keep me there until 11pm or 1am every night are quite irritating.&nbsp; It's time to quit with the lazy, slacker, retirement-in-my-20's lifestyle and find something useful to do with myself.&nbsp; Therefore:  &nbsp;  1) Young Life.&nbsp; The best thing about my high school years and the most important activity of my college years is coming back to me now.&nbsp; When I was 17, I thought like I was supposed to do ministry, but didn't want to be one of those guys who went straight on through and never checked out the real world.&nbsp; Plus, it's better to make sure nothing else could satisfy you before you go into ministry.&nbsp; I'm getting to that point.&nbsp; Now, if I could just get ahold of the Syracuse Young Life Leader Guy...  &nbsp;  2) Professor.&nbsp; This would require me going back to school.&nbsp; I already have some info on the GRE's and social science grad schools.&nbsp; The idea would be to become a political science professor.&nbsp; This is still on the back burner while I try for career #1 (though calling #1 a career is really weird, it's more of a lifestyle).  &nbsp;  3) 9-5.&nbsp; This is the third and final option, but may also be an interim job while I find job #1 or job #2.&nbsp; The goal would be to get out of the 4-11 time slot, since Lindsey, Jen, Dustin, Josh, Laura,&nbsp;and Markle all went the day-job route.&nbsp; There's no one left to hang out with when I get off work at night.&nbsp; They're all asleep.&nbsp; I guess this makes me the last slacker.  &nbsp;  Well, there you have it.&nbsp; An update on nothing, since nothing is currently happening.

       Very few things worthy of note on Thursday.&nbsp; I made a couple of fistfuls of money at work, but that caused me to miss heading downtown to see my now early-evening day-job friends, who pack it in at 11pm.&nbsp; I can usually rush down there and have a drink with them before they go to bed, but not this week.  &nbsp;  Most of the afternoon was spent mucking about on my parents' computer, which is my current home base of operations, because it has multiple viruses and the Norton Anti-Virus is very picky about which ones it likes to detect and which ones it likes to fix.&nbsp; I don't have a degree in Viruses, Trojans, Worms, and Spyware, so all I do is follow the directions and hope it works.&nbsp; I really have more important things to do, like starting my job search, but stuff like that always seems to get in the way.&nbsp; It's tough to get motivated to grab a real job when you get to leave work with fistfuls of money and sleep late.

      Yesterday I got myself up at 8am, which is like 4am if I had a 9-5 job.  I did this so I could get my girlfriend's oil changed before our quick trip to Oswego to get all the stuff she had been putting off getting since January.  It's amazing that I have found someone who is more of a procrastinator than I am.  This girl is a professional crastinator.  By the way, her mileage was almost at 8,000 and she hadn't bothered to change the oil yet.  I had my oil changed, too, but my change was only 1,500 miles past due.  My parents then took me out to brunch at around 11.  It was Denny's, which puts it below Stella's, Mother's Cupboard, and the Egg-Plant on the Syracuse diner food chain.  At least fourth, probably lower, but it ranked first on the proximity meter in a torrential downpour.  I had the All-American Slam, and it baffles me that you can't substitute grits for sausage.  I work in restaurants.  Seriously, I'm trying to save Denny's money.  Sausage costs way more than grits.  I'm not saying I should be running the corporation, but...  Lindsey and I went to Oswego and came back.  After all this excitement on my day off, I went home to rest 'til about 9.  I am the pimp daddy of eating, as was evidenced by my being taken out to eat for the second time in one day.  I still have three Tully's eggroll halves sitting in my fridge for lunch today.  We watched Cold Mountain after that and discussed the possible merits or the Ruby/Georgia relationship because it worked out in the end without much flashiness (me) vs. the Ada/Inman relationship because it was soooo romantic (Lindsey).  I got home at around three and signed Dewon Brazelton to my fantasy baseball team to pitch on Saturday.  That's all you need to know.  Get off my back :)

      I normally get out of bed around 10:30am. I don't even have to set my alarm.  Sunday, I was up at 5:30am because Lindsey With The Donuts and I were heading to New York, into the path of Hurricane Whats-Its-Face, to watch a baseball game. Not a very promising prospect, save for the fact that I had checked weather.com to learn the beast would pass through New York by around 10:00am and that the remainder of the day would be "partly cloudy".  The game was very well pitched by one Big Unit, the 6'10" Randy Johnson. He held my Mets to zero runs on some meager number of hits. You know you're watching pitching dominance when you get excited about routing ground balls. Judging that maybe a few Mets popped out in foul territory, I can safely say that only half the Mets batters even put the ball in play. Not a very action-filled game, especially when it rained off-and-on from the 4th inning on.  We sat next to a couple of Brits in America for the first time, on the second day of their adventure. Scott was quite the baseball fan, talking to me about Ichiro, the Yankees, etc. He explained to his completely uninterested girlfriend/friend/wife? Kat that the Yankees were like Manchester United and the Mets were like the lowly Manchester City. I'm not going to take the time here to explain nuance to those who enjoy neither baseball nor futbol.  My man Mike Cameron (who is on my fantasy baseball team) provided two of the three most exciting moments of the day, making a catch running backward into the gap in the first inning, and then getting thrown out trying to steal third with one out, which is a cardinal sin against the unwritten rules of baseball. Mets manager Art Howe got pretty ticked about the second one, so mad I think he forgot what he was mad about, so he decided to yell at the umpire for calling Mike out. The umpire, who I'm sure doesn't like getting yelled at, did the dance that umpires do when they give someone the heave-ho. It's something of a triple-hop on the right foot and then a left step and right arm swing. He had such perfect form the crowd went nuts. Either that, or we were proud of our manager for sticking it to the man in black. I think it was the latter.  Okay, enough of the game itself. I'm sure I've already bored you and you've stopped reading. We stopped at the Palisades Mall to eat on the trip home, and I had Greek food court food. It was pretty good stuff. Let me tell you, the Palisades Mall makes Carousel look like a backwater dump. Oh wait, Syracuse is backwater and Carousel is a dump. Palisades is still pretty nice, though. Like Manchester United to Carousel's Manchester City.  We actually drove all the way to New York and back in one day to see a rainy baseball game. Got to bed around midnight. I'd do it again.

      Yesterday I started running again, after something of a two-week hiatus that didn't really have much in the way of reasons.  It just happened.  That's the way these things start, these pauses in an exercise regimen.  Granted, I'm no Jack LaLane, but I'm trying to make things right here now that I have time.  Throughout college, I couldn't really get anything going with school, work, Young Life, Campus Crusade, and writing comics.  There just wasn't time.  Now there is.  As a bit of advice to those who are fat and lazy, start small.  Exercise is not something you can do all-out from the get-go and expect to enjoy very far into the future.  It takes a lot of time and energy, something most of us don't think we have enough of.  So start small.  That's why I'm running.  Just running, nothing more or less.  Soon I may add some crunches to the mix, or some other means of getting rid of the beer gut I've had since I was born.  After that, maybe I'll add some means of wait training.  It really doesn't matter how long it takes, as long as the commitment to exercise is established.  Then everything else is a breeze...I hope.  Not much else to report around here.  Pretty much doing the same as always.  Sleeping late and working nights, making a piece of money while I try to get some other things off the ground, managing the fantasy baseball team and playing Lode Runner (one of the smartest video games ever).  It's a hard life, I know, but somebody's gotta do it.

      My girlfriend's new nickname is "Stoner".  She is not yet 23 and is in the process of passing her first kindey stone.  This could be taken as a beautiful thing, preparing her for the future pains of childbirth, but I doubt she agrees.  She once told me how the feminists who teach classes at her college tried to convince the girls that their time of the month was some sort of special feminine treat that needs to be celebrated.  Again, not buying there.  This was all something of an interesting experience for me due to my high level of involvement in the matter.  No, I did not create some magic little stone and insert it into her kindey using telepathy.  In fact, I am by no means responsible for it, which is kinda nice.  I don't like it when bad things happen to my girlfriend, but there's a hint of a silver lining when the bad things that happen to her are not my fault.  I get to watch out for her and be a support, mostly by doing not much of anything, and she gets to be happy she has me.  That said, I am not condoning Lindsey's kidney stone.   She'd kill me twice if I did.  Kindey stones and beat-downs should go to bad people, instead of the former going to my excellent girlfriend and the latter going to a homeless guy I know.  I took her home after seeing "The Village" at about 2:30am Saturday, but was back at her house 2.5 hours later because the slight pain in her abdomen had become unbearable and she couldn't wait until the regular doctor, who could charge her less, opened at 9am.  That's fine.  Sometimes you gotta take care of things.  The emergency room financial personnel set her up with some sort of insurance to take place of her lack of insurance and apparently she doesn't have to pay, which is nice.  For once, the emergency room was empty and they were able to take her right in.  Who ever heard of such a thing?  An emergency room where you don't have to wait 3 hours to see a doctor.  Awesome.  Less time there for me, more time sleeping, which I did from about 7:30am 'til 1:15pm.  Not much of a night's sleep, leaving me groggy all day, but not so bad I couldn't have Lindsey over and make individual pizzas for her and my parents.  Oh, and I learned a lot that I have since forgotten about Carly Simon on CNN in the waiting room.  All told, weird but decent day.  Went out for a drink with some high school buddies at night, one of whom told me he enjoyed the rants in my blog, but not the fact that he was sitting in front of a computer.  Huh?  Final bit of advice:  If you think you are in danger of kindey stones, and we all are, eat less cheese and fewer oranges.  Good night.

      The day has pretty much gotten away from me here, and I have spent it doing this, that, and absolutely nothing.  I actually got done with everything except the self-improvement stuff, yknow, reading the Bible and running...well...on the whole it was an extremely successful day.  Is this a sign I should quit my job and just bum around all day?  Would I "get more done"?  Anywho, I'm listening to the new "Badly Drawn Boy" CD online because it's free and I can...and it's much better than I had expected.  There's some Tom Waits instrumental silliness thrown in with a less-depressed Wilco sound and some new-millenium rap influences as he uses kids to sing a chorus or two.  This guy is pretty interesting.  I may have to get into this...Good Night.

      I am now 50% done with the day's scheduled tasks.  I sent the e-mail and TRIED to install the scanner.  Looks like the scanner may be a no-go because it's old and the software is incompatible with Windows XP, but at least I wasted an hour restarting my computer, changing power supplies, and running scans that didn't work.  At least I have that going for me.  As a final note, perhaps I should add "eat" to the list, since I'm the only one home and have a tendency to forget to do that.  Alright...pressing onward...

      As of today, I will be using only the "one procrastination at a time" blog for everything.  It only seems right and just to give my public the easiest access to myself.  The distinctions between the blogs were becoming less and less distinct, so you can assume they have become one, as the Christ prayed that He, the Father, people, etc. would become in one of the most verbose passages in the New Testament (John 17).  In fact, that passage rivals the oft-misinterpreted Romans 7 for repetition of the same cluster of words.  You wanna talk about putting things off?  Today is my only complete day off for the week.  I celebrated this by putting off getting up in the morning.  I went to bed at 4am and got up at 12:45pm.  So much for having a productive day...yet I have been productive by certain industry standards.  I returned my Adidas Adissage sandals to Dick's, where I bought them about 2 months ago, for an identical pair.  They're the ones with the bumps on the bottom that most people don't like because they "hurt your feet".  Granted, they hurt a little at the start of the summer.  Granted, all you could see on the bottoms of my feet for a few weeks was dead skin that needed to be peeled off.  This does not constitute a bad sandal.  This constitutes the necessary acquisition of "summer feet", or the kind of feet everyone used to have before they invented closed-toed shoes.  Anyway...the bumps started falling off, which is really odd after 2 months.  I can only hope the Chinese made a bad pair and that the new ones will live up to previous expectations of the Adissage.  I also bought shave gel today, which means I have now accomplished, at 4pm, 25% of the list I created for today at 4am last night.  Still to go:  -Cleaning the floor of my bedroom -Running, which I haven't done in almost 10 days -Installing the scanner on my computer -Studying the Bible -Feeding my parents' cats while they're out-of-town -email this girl who is supposedly writing a childrens' book and might need an illustrator  I think I can get it all done, but it may mean no big night on the town tonight...not that I have any friends around here who don't have day jobs...
