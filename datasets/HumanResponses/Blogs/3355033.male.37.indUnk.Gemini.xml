      Next week, the County Auditors' Association of Ohio meets at their semi-annual conference. I plan on attending. Hopefully, I'll meet many of you there. I know that I'll recognize many faces and hope that I'll get to know you better.  After the conference, I'll post any pictures that I take and plan on sending each of you note cards announcing the site and also personally emailing you an invitation to join the forum.  If you choose to join the web blog, feel free to use it to communicate with all of the other auditors across the state.

      When I was growing up, my mom, Lula Mae Kuhn, worked for the Shelby County Auditor's office. The auditor at the time was Janet Miller who has since passed away. My best memory of my mom working at the auditor's office was how she took my school fundraising projects to work and I ended up outselling all of my classmates. I never knew my connection to the auditor's office would continue.  Since then, though, my mom stopped selling stuff for me and I had to do it myself. I went to work with Lee Hauser. Lee used to work for Accordia local government and in 1992 became Hauser & Associates, a Boston Mutual General Agent. Shortly after that I was introduced to Lee through a friend of mine and we have been working together since about 1995. Currently, with the help of Lee, Paul Finnell, Rhonda Whitaker and our other associates, we help over 30 Indiana county governments who offer Boston Mutual to their employees.  Many of you know me from my dealings with your county specifically and many of you I owe a great deal of thanks for helping me get the word out about what a great product we have at Boston Mutual. For those of you I haven't met yet, you might know me as the Blackjack dealer at your semi-monthly conferences. If I haven't met you yet, hopefully, we can meet soon. In any case, I hope to continue to help more of your counties and strive to do the best I can to serve you.  As a way to give back something to each of you, I hope that you use this website as a way to enhance the great relationships I've witnessed over the past few years.  Thank you again for your continued support. It is appreciated very much.  Michael Kuhn Hauser & Associates Insurance Services A Boston Mutual General Agency

      Since I couldn't make it to the auditors' conference this month, I wanted to do something for the Indiana auditors and so I created this web blog for you to communicate with each other. A blog is your easy-to-use web site, where you can quickly post thoughts, interact with other auditors, and more. All for FREE.  I've sent each auditor in the state an invitation via email to join so be sure and join the blog today by following the instructions in the email. It will take a while for news to spread about your web blog, but you can use this site to share news and other important information. Over time, it'll provide a good place on the web to call home if you use it.  If you are unfamiliar with what to do, I've attached some links below to help you get started:   urlLink What is a blog?   urlLink How do I create a blogger account?   urlLink Where do I sign in?   urlLink How do I post to the blog?   urlLink How do I add comments to posts?   Your host,  Michael Kuhn Hauser & Associates A Boston Mutual General Agency

      We've been working with Rush County for many years now and Mary Ann Beard has been a great help to me and I can see why all of the auditors have such a great respect for her throughout the state. Below is a letter of recommendation that she wrote for us.   It is our pleasure to provide a professional reference concerning the Employee Life Option program by Boston Mutual Life Insurance Company.  Rush County has been participating over the last several years and has not had any problems. Each year, Michael Kuhn, our representative comes in and presents the program to any new employees and updates any changes to existing employees. There is no pressure for our employees to take this insurance and it is all on a voluntary basis. Mr. Kuhn has always been very professional, courteous and helpful.  We would like to highly recommend this company.  Thank you.  Mary Ann Beard Rush County Auditor

Pictures can also be posted, so everyone can post a picture of themselves if they have the technical know-how.  So, what you'll want to do, is join the blog, you should have gotten an invitation via email. For more information on using the blog, go to  urlLink www.blogger.com .
