      I made some low carb burgers yesterday...because we ran out of bread and I had already de-thawed the meat.  Heh heh...de-thawed the meat...I have to write that one down.   That's right...I'm trying to make "I made some low carb burgers yesterday...because we ran out of bread and I had already de-thawed the meat" into something dirty. But it just doesn't work.  But the burgers were okay-ish. I used the George Foreman grill, which knocked the fat out.  Then I ate chocolate frosting by the handful. Just to even things out.  I think the maintenance man at our apartment (or...luxury rental townhome) complex can tell that I'm unemployed right now, and is mocking me with knowing looks. Because I'm not only unemployed, but I'm short! And there was that time I couldn't get the sink unclogged.  It wasn't MY fault. He had two plungers and I only had one!   But enough of my plunger envy.   I didn't get more bread because I don't have much cash right now. And I refuse to go to the store for the single purpose of buying bread. I get bread, when I get gas for the car. Because gas station bread is cheap yet okay.   Mood - I'm only Okay

      I had an urge today to write romance books about tough broads who are independant and don't need a man...until they find a man so manly, that they fall for his manliness...and hard chest.  Then instead, I decided to write this entry. Thus,  you  won.  It's consistently my favourite kind of climate right now outside. Early Spring, slightly warm with nice breezes. I get to enjoy being out on the patio, watching kids ignore their parents to strains of "if you don't start listening, I'm going to spank your bottom!".  Kids don't fear that! Not when they're outside and have so much room to escape. And a ball to kick.  I wish I had a ball to kick. But there hasn't been a ball sale in awhile.

      I'm really into saying "Dunderpate" lately. Not out loud mind you, but just in my head. Dunderpate...ahh...refreshing.  My cats are now addicted to laser pointer chasing, and it's overtaking all facets of my life. I might as well just be a floating arm with a laser pointer.

      I'm in the annoying stage of feeling kind of sick, for like, almost two weeks now. I start feeling better, then I get a fever that night, and then I'm feeling terrible all that day, then kind of good that night, then I wake up sick again. It's really getting in the way of my usual...sitting around...watching television. Because I can't concentrate with a headache!  I almost threw up yesterday at the gym when riding an exercycle, laziest of all the exercise equipment. Ah...sitting *and* exercising, together at last.  What else Exciting has been going on...let me see...I haven't seen my baby nephew much this because I don't want to get him sick. He's cool because he wears his pants low, because that's how the kids dress today. Well, they dress that way if they have such tiny baby legs and baby bellies that the pants are way too big.  My wife got promoted! I'm celebrating by cooking a nice pot roast. I'm the Ultimate Homemaker right now inbetween jobs. Too bad that doesn't help my resume. Oh well, temp work helps inbetween making beds and vacuuming to keep a man strong.  I'm really into Baby Looney Tunes right now. They're totally hype. Along with all kinds of morning programming.

      I find it kind of sad to realize that an ear ache can still send me instantly back into a child state.  Fevers make me a wussy.  Headaches make me a pansy.  But ear aches, make me a child.   "Owwie! I can't sleep with this side of my head on the pillow!"  On the bright side, I have BT again.  BT = Bathroom Tissue, because I'm civilized.

      My first bad review was a long time in the making.  Back during my early college years, one of my high school friends (Gentleman Jeff) worked at one of the other colleges' radio station. We had been off and on writing things together for a few years (it was very romantic), with leftover energies from high school English projects. He convinced the head of the station to let us do a sketch radio show to air fairly late at night. It required many badly quickly written sketches per week, but was fun to do. Everyone who worked with us said that I intentionally blew lines on harder to do sketches just to make them have to repeat their lines over and over, but I just sucked. I never got to listen to the final product, because my house was out of the radio's range one city over, but that was okay, because I hate the sound of my voice. I eventually managed to write myself out of my own scripts most of the time anyway though, because it was half my show and I could do as I pleased.  Eventually we worked out a deal with the local community access channel to have a weekly show on their television station.  We had to write like, 10 episodes or so as a submission, which required writing 3 decent shows, and filling the rest with crap and recycled ideas from the radio show with bad sight gags included. But the station was bought out before we got to air, and the new company cut all new productions from starting. The good Gentleman was disappointed, and it gave me less to do as a hobby, but I figured I was saved from local community humiliation to some degree.  Anyway, that led to Jeff getting me to promise to help him work on a stage show. I figured that the two of us were lazy enough that it wouldn't happen anyway, and even if, I said I didn't really want to be the one who acted, so I wouldn't take the blame. A year rolled by and nothing happened. However, the year after, I was shocked that Jeff went and got us a slot in a local stage show festival. I had promised, and now I had to deliver, and we were short handed, so it would have to be a two man show.  We had about a month and a half to write the show, and memorize it. I can't memorize lines worth a crap, so I made everything simple for myself, and wrote Jeff most of the parts, since he has a good radio voice and does good impressions.    Then to promote the show (because if I had to do it, I wanted to at least make some good scratch from it) we got on the most popular morning news/entertainment show in the Martime (Nova Scotia/New Brunswick/PEI) provinces, Breakfast Television. Sort of like the Today Show, with a smaller budget,  and ummm...a smaller set. I was surprised to find out that the way to book yourself on the show was to find their phone number, call them up, and just say "Can I be on your show?". After almost having a nervous breakdown before we went on (half because we hadn't really come up with what we were going to do with our 10 minute set that we promised them we'd fill, and not knowing what questions we'd get, the other half because I figured I'd humilate myself), I managed to do it, and we did a 4 minute interview with 6 minutes of doing some sketch we made up in the parking lot that was a lot of nonsensical high school french. Surprisingly the hosts liked it, and then we left the set when someone grilling some breakfast managed to catch something on fire.  I came home to a day of many calls from family friends with the question of "Why the heck was Brian on television today?", and trying to explain why it was in French. I had no good excuse.  The show rolled around in early September, and we had to do 18 showings in a converted dance stage. Semi-converted...most of the other acts at that stage were dance acts from the States and Ontario. Actual professionals who make their living off what we were half-assing. We had one hour the day before to do a rehersal and practice sound cues with the sound tech we were given by the festival. She preferred the dance acts and didn't particularly try very hard to follow our cues.  So our first show happens and we've no idea how to really use the space we're given, and only have the costume changes half timed out, and have an hour of show to keep memorized in front of our first audience. And luckily the major newspaper of the province has sent their reviewer for the first show.   We got a nice big terrible review in the paper. Jeff was very upset, I figured it was inevitable. It doubled our audience for the rest of the show. Sadly, we were the biggest drawing show at our venue by quite a bit, so we started using our advertising to advertise the other, better, shows. All our comment cards (aka, writing on the back of ticket stubs)  were complimentary, and we got more laughs than I thought. Though what got laughs changed every time. The only other major problems were the night my mother and my aunt watched the show and took a picture in mid sketch. Now the lighting is very bright and hot, and I'm sweating terribly, as chubby dudes do, and I can't see the audience much beyond a shadowy mass...and then BAM, flash. I don't think I got a line right for the next 10 minutes. The other bad night was a 10 pm show on a Wednesday, the second that night, where basically a handful of people showed up. I gave them Twisted Sister tapes to thank them for being out on a Wednesday night.  Which brings me to my point. When we were doing the radio show, my friend Ingram was helping us do some voices, and he did a pratfall in our very, very small recording booth. The people in the live feed booth next door gave us the oddest looks...Ingram still has scars from that fall. And the microphone didn't even pick up the noise...and we didn't even ask him to do it. But he says he enjoyed the experience, and liked our writing better than we did so he didn't mind saying all the stupid things we had him say. So, there you have it, some experiences leave you scarred  and  enriched.  And some just leave you scarred. That review was NASTY, and everyone I knew read it.   Luckily I made enough scratch from the show to buy plane tickets and move to a different country.

      For no real reason other than I feel like writing it out today (I'll get out of my complaining, pointless downer stories mode soon most likely, or just not post for awhile, and then do a few one liner stupid posts):  When my father first got sick, he had been retired about one year. He had been a ship captain for years, taking passenger and cargo ships from Cape Breton to Newfoundland, and running smaller ships along the coast of Newfoundland. He had always had stress problems, and being in charge of getting very large ships into sometimes hard ports was getting the best of him, as was the continuing modernization of his job. He retrained and tried hard, but he had only had an 8th grade education, and that from a one room school house, and he always afraid that would catch up to him. So when he got his retirement package fairly early in his mid-50s, he gladly took it.  But my Dad was always a busy body and couldn't keep still, so he tried to take some local ship jobs (and one in Edmonton) to pass the time. When he got sick he was captaining some boats helping recover wreckage from a Swiss Air flight that had crashed off the coast of Nova Scotia. We first noticed he was sick when he lost his voice. Everyone figured he had caught some sort of cold while out at sea and his throat had gotten bad.  He was also showing signs of confusion, but they were slight and no one thought much of them other than getting frustrated by him from time to time.  After a few weeks passed we finally got him in to see a doctor about his throat. She was surprised to see that his vocal cords were basically deadened rather than having a viral infection. About 2 more weeks passed before the doctor finally convinced him (after constant bothering) that he needed further testing.  After a few misfires on the testing (which added up to almost a month of not knowing the results and having to do it again), we found out that my father had cancer on his vocal cords. And lungs. And in his arm. And in his brain. He must have developed lung cancer from smoking over a year before and it had spread badly throughout his body. None of us had noticed any signs before he lost his voice. It was mid-July then, and we were told (though he was not) that he'd be lucky to live to Christmas.  What followed was a frantic race for anything to help. Radiation treatment was the only thing the doctor's could do, and only on his throat to try and restore his voice. My father went through a lot of discomfort, but never got his full voice back. My mother tried every sort of miracle pill, even shark cartiledge, to try and help, fearing that if she didn't try everything, that she would feel like she didn't try enough. My father just put his life in our hands as far as he could, trusting us to do our best. He was weak at this point and rarely got out of his favourite chair. He asked us to buy a bigger television with picture-in-picture (he had always wanted picture-in-picture), so we got that for him, and he enjoyed his favourite shows to pass the days away. We would treat him with ice cream most nights to help ease the pain on his throat.  One of the hardest parts of the whole ordeal was the fact that with the cancer being in his brain, he slowly got more and more confused. He soon forgot my name if not who I was. Eventually he would just call any name he could remember and I would figure it was for me, or he would just wave me over. He would call me in to tell me something, then stare at me in the eyes, and try with all his power to remember what it was he was going to say, and then just cry because he couldn't. He would get so frustrated that he couldn't even remember his own wife's name. He remembered the deeper things, but things like names and short term things were lost to him long frustrating moments.  But we tried to never get sad (and God, it was hard) or frustrated with him. If he forgot, we'd just sit with him and tell him he'd remember eventually. After awhile he'd forget that he was even trying to remember things, and he'd calm down and relax.  He didn't sleep much at night because of the pain, until we got good enough drugs. The nights when we hadn't had the fullest strength morphine to give him were the hardest, and he'd be up moaning in pain, wanting to pace the floors to walk it off, but not being quite strong enough. We'd take him on drives to keep his mind off of it.   It was about late August when my girlfriend broke up with me. It was the right time for us in a lot of ways to break up, except that she had been my closest friend through the ordeal and my only confidant. My other friends were scared of trying to think of things to say to me, and I had trouble just being 'normal' most of the time and acting like my life was the way it always had been. I tried, but most of the time the tension was there. So from August until the funeral in late October, I didn't talk to a single friend or person outside of my immediate family (who didn't really want to talk about it either) about anything that was going on. I became pretty dependant on prescribed sleeping pills at this point. It was easier to black out a day with the pills than face a lot of what was going on.  My parents wanted me back in college classes. I tried, but by then we were on "any time, any day" watch, and I was in fear that it could happen while I was away, or that I'd have to wait for a college worker who I didn't know found me somewhere on campus to tell me, then I'd have to either take the bus, or wait an hour for someone to come pick me up and drive me to the hospital or wherever. It's hard to care about finance classes at times like that, and I would just get angry at everything around me at school.   One of the hardest things to see was watching people close to my father too scared to be around him. My father loved company. Just seeing the people he cared for come visit him. The more the better, as he couldn't talk much, he could just sit back and listen to everyone else carry the conversation. He usually cried a bit, but it was out of happiness of seeing people. But some of his closest friends and siblings were in denial that he was dying and absolutely (to the point of shouting and us and the friends who understood) refused to see him, because in their mind, he wasn't dying. We tried our best to cover up for them and make sure my father didn't notice, but we could tell that some people's absense hurt him. They also tended to take it hardest when he passed on.  Around mid-October things surprisingly started to look up. My father had gotten some new prescriptions, and his  head had started to clear up a bit, and he was feeling good enough for little day trips now and then. He started talking about beating the cancer (the first he had talked about the cancer at all really) and going on a cruise in the Spring. He had always wanted to take a cruise with my mother, and they had had plans for a vacation that Fall that they had cancelled much to his chagrin. He even went to a restaurant and had a few bites of food and seemed to be really enjoying himself.  Then one night I heard him up with my Mom, seemingly with bowel problems. I know they went to a quick visit to the doctor that night, but they told me when they got back that it wasn't serious. The doctor had said he was just backed up because his bowels were weak. That morning I had midterm exams at university. My father had a routine check up at the hospital. I decided after they left to skip the exam.   I fell asleep after they left because I had been up all night (I'm next to the bathroom), and my brother was asleep in the basement. Then I was awoken by nonstop phone ringing, and someone banging on our door. It was our neighbour from across the street at the door, and my aunt on the phone. Minutes after arriving at the hospital for his test, my father had died. It was the worst moment in my life, and I still can barely handle thinking about it.  My brother and I rushed over to the hospital. My mother was out of her mind, obviously, since no one had figured it was going to happen then. Then she wanted us all to spend some time with his body in the room he had died in. His eyes were wide open, so was his mouth, he even still had his glasses on. I couldn't stand that I hadn't been there.  Other family came, but they freaked out when they saw him. I don't know why the doctor's couldn't have at least closed his eyes. It was the longest 2 hours of my life. Seeing your loved one at a funeral is hard, but it's something you can handle because you love them. Seeing them right after death is...I wanted him back.  What I didn't know is that the same day someone in your family dies, you have to go to the funeral home and make the arrangements that day. So hours after I had been woken up by the phone, I was picking out a casket and what kind of tomb for my father. My mother couldn't think through her grief, and my brother honestly didn't help much, so my aunt and I had to write my father's obituary for the paper right then as well.   I had to call everyone when we got home and tell them the news, and soon we had a full house with lots of food and people trying to comfort my mother to sleep.  I honestly don't remember much passed that, as I just finally decided to go in my room, close the door, and finally let it hit me. My father was gone, I would never hear him talk again, never see his smile, never see his annoyed little frown, never see him sitting in his chair enjoying his Britcoms on PBS. He would never see my grandkids, he never met my wife, never get the time off his deserved after all those years of a job he hated that took him away for half the year just to help provide for us. I've still never really coped with it (obviously since I'm writing this now, though this helps little beyond making me tear up constantly).  And...well, I don't know what else to write. I'm not sure why I bothered with this much other than I woke up with the need to write it. Oh well. Bye.

      You know, it seems like one day, you're talking to your best friends about video games and what's your plans for the weekend, and then the next you're talking to one best friend about if your other friend is required to "put out" babies because his soon to be wife wants some, and he's moving into her house after the wedding. And you're thinking, God, I've got to be doing something on that front before too long as well, but my cats are good enough for now...and I'm training on my nephew. Right...  We still talk about video games though. Just more expensive systems, cause we got jobs now, dawg.

      My wife is good at Lingo, yet I am not, even though I had good grades in English all those years...I think it's because I want to guess "Brian" for every turn. I threaten to sign her up to Lingo, saying that if we get picked, we have to go. She disputes this. Thus life continues this way.  Did you know my blog is fucking chock (CHOCK!) full of carbs? Well it is! You could die!! I didn't remove the bun to make it a atkins friendly blog. Actually, I lost about 30 pounds while eating only carby foods, in around 2 months. I did something radical like exercise every day and cut back on my food. And it's hard to avoid carbs when all I can cook well is pasta dishes and rice dishes (I'm the sauce king), and your wife is rightfully nicknamed by friends and family "Jojo Potatobug".  In closing...my sister in law (creator of my adorable new nephew Max) wants us to all go on Family Fued one day. And we will. And I will tell you when that happens. Survey Says: Victory!  Then we'll fight over the meager prize money. Then blow it all on the carbiest meal you ever saw. I will eat the most.  There...everything tied together nicely.

      I was just thinking about how miserable I was when I was going to university. During 5 years there, I managed to not meet a single person to talk to, stood out in the rain and snow probably about 200 hours combined, or more. Dropped out of two majors embarassingly. Spent most of my time in the library trying to make hours pass between too spaced out classes because I always sent my class request in late. Had my girlfriend of 4 years dump me because I was the model of failure. Had my father die of brain cancer. Had the school kick me out because of the amount of classes I failed during the time my father was dying of brain cancer and afterwards. And ummm...I never ate lunch the entire 5 years because I have a thing about sitting by myself at cafeterias/and I'm embarassed eating by myself in public. But I'm just a whiner though, so take it with two handfuls of salt. There, that's a nice deep, easy to relate to blog entry.

      ...I think I have a prostate problem. How I long for the days of universal health care. Oh well, going every half hour isn't that bad, as long as I have interesting things to do in the bathroom, and that's the reason why I simply had to get subscriptions to like, 13 magazines. Plus I like to be knowledgeable about many stupid things across a whole slew of stupid topics. It makes people respect and fear me. Like I owned a Hummer SUV.

      Actually I have milk...in the fridge.  I've decided I should become obsessed with learning something that will better myself. Unfortunetely, the idea has already bored me. So instead, I'm going to try to sleep in late, go to the gym most of the afternoon, cook a long meal, and then enjoy prime time television, get bored of prime time television after 15 minutes, spend some time on the internet, get bored of the internet after 14 minutes, pester my wife and my cats because I'm bored, and then watch the Daily Show, but turn off the television before Tough Crowd comes on. Then I'll take aspirin for the knee I hurt at the gym, and try to get asleep again until almost the afternoon the next day. I really need to find a job.

      I'm eternally tickled several different colours at how I'm currently doing at whatever I'm doing. For example, I figured out that by turning the title doohickey on, I have titles. Now I'm just wasting space making posts about nothing at all, just to give my blog some meat.   Don't get all churlish on me about it either. I hate when people front me with the churl.  Who am I kidding, what do  you  care?  wiggie fact #2: When I look at clouds, I only ever see ponies. And I don't even like horses that much. I don't  dislike  them,  I just have no particular interest in them any more than say I would ummm...mousepads.  I'm not that interested in mousepads.  There was this kid I had a computer class with back in high school, circa 1995ish, who hit print screen, and then just stared at the screen waiting for a print out. He was NOT pleased when he found out he had to walk all the way to the printer. The moral of the story was, that he once snorted drugs in class. And then the teacher later gave some other kid a detention for playing crazy 8s in class instead of...I'm not sure exactly what we did in that class. I talked a whole lot about Mr. T, and made several Mr. T related programs.  So to finish, here's the wiggie timeline:  1978 - born, was cold, needed a haircut  1985 - started school, was cold, needed a haircut  1990 - I think I invented Pokemon around this time, but proceeded to fall back asleep, and then someone else invented it later.  1996 - Was peculiarly proud of a pair of green jeans that I owned. I no longer fit into them.  Everything else really isn't that important.

      I have no idea what I'm doing...and my page is ugly, but I figured, since I'm lazy, this would be easier to do short, quick, ultimately stupid posts. Plus everyone else has a blog in this style now. Yes, that's right, I'm copying you. Except one major difference. An Exciting difference.  I'm making Swedish Meatballs!   wiggie fact: I hardly ever wear just one shirt.

      Umm...this new format is very scary to me. So while I'm paralyzed by fear of new technology, I'll just cut and paste my last diaryland post (and I can cut and paste using technology, while being scared of it! Shut up!):  March!  MARCH!!!   Well, let's see...not a whole lot going on in my life right now. Because you were so interested and asked and everything. Job hunting sucks the big one (you know which one), and America is currently *looks outside* full of puddles. I found a Canadian food website that sells stuff I can't get here in America, and I cried over seeing Joe Louis cakes.  urlLink  http://canadianfavourites.com/cover.html . There are a lot of things I can get here as well, because the website is lazy, but HP sauce...man, I need me some HP sauce. But that costs money, which I don't have. I can't even afford my library dues, and the library is supposed to be free entertainment! The system is corrupt. I'll just pretend that the big puddles outside are a good fill-in for the Atlantic Ocean off Nova Scotia's coast. And the dog taking a crap is like a ship in the ocean.   Because you cared what was going on in my life!   Actually, I assume that no one cares. I love the term "googling" someone as a way of saying you're looking up someone you used to know (or stalk) on the internet. It's such a weird word for it, if you didn't know the context. But I assume I'm the one person who has never been "googled" in the whole world, who didn't live in the woods all by myself. Besides coincidental look-ups by people looking up stuff on journeyman NBA player Brian Skinner. I feel bad if people looking stuff up for him find my pages and info. That would be disappointing to them, I'm sure. I hate disappointing people, but hey, it's what I do.

      When I was young McDonald's was this mystical fantasy land where I got food and toys at the same time. Ronald and his rogues gallary lived in a fairy land that seemed better than the one I did. And that Christmas commercial where he skated with the kid who was smaller than the rest...that defined a generation.  The magic is gone now. They're just another restaurant who's trying to be low fat and appeal to youth with rapping. *hangs head low* Times have changed, and the wind has blown by me...and that wind doesn't smell too good my friend. It's like a cheap air freshener with some name like 'snowy mountain flower breeze" that ends up smelling like nothing but bathroom.  *sighs* I still want a Big Mac now and then.  The point of this was to brag that I've lost almost 40 pounds. Or roughly about the size of that kid that Ronald McDonald helped skate around the pond. And I don't look like I've lost a pound. Now that's talent.

      I've decided that my new catchphrase is to green people with, "What's new in Kalamazoo?". Any possible mispellings of "Kalamazoo" is due to me trying to trademark it and "give it my own flavour". It's all part of my new campaign to make people like me for being extraverted and annoyingly in their face with my "flavour". People respect someone who can't and won't shut up and has quirks. Then I'll stab them in the back!  Which will only make me even more popular.  Which is a good goal!

      I think coupons are life's biggest disappointment. Most of the time. But not always.  So maybe I'm wrong.  But still, I'm disappointed when fast food restaurants put out coupons that only really have normal prices on them, or the prices of sales that are going on. You don't even need the paper. I want to feel special.  But I'm not special.  And my cellphone hasn't worked in months, yet I still pay for it. Lousy contract. I don't get more with T-Mobile. Not at all.  Oh well, there is one good thing, and that's the fact that I actually ummm...no wait, that's not it at all.  Okay, here's the thing:   Okay, I forget the thing.

      Yes, I do make my stupid titles by just looking at things around or on my computer desk. And yes, I was originally going to call this blog "The Adventures of Brian The Man". But Brian doesn't rhyme with "The Man". And it hurts me, inside, to know that.  Some dude at the pet store was all in my face, telling me how to feed my cats, and I was all, "back off man, I don't tell you how to feed the donkey you're obviously having sex with, you Mr. Ass in your Ass guy!".  But yeah, I actually just said, "that's an excellent plan, I was considering doing that myself." I hate when I have to agree with the expertise (That I was going to do anyway!) of some punk teenager whom I'm older than and thus obviously smarter than.  I went to college, damn it! I know all kinds of stuff! Sure it's not as strenuous as the training for Petsmart...and I mostly drew doodles of the current date on my notes and somehow backed my way into a Human Resources degree...but hey, if there's one thing I know, it's how to fall asleep in a library. And how to feed my cats. They're  my  cats. They talk to me. They say things like "meow", and "mew", and I know what they mean.  Do you know?   I considered, briefly, today that I would force my future child into learning some sport that would make him or her famous and more importantly, rich, so that I could become rich by getting handouts. Then I figured that I would probably have to wait, at the very least, 15 years after the birth of the child for that to happen. I'd be so OLD! I'm old enough now. I ain't got no patience for that. So I figured I'd just cross my fingers and hope my brother would somehow become famous soon. I'm told he's handsome, if not an aimless gatabout.  So Scott, get famous, get me money. I'm hungry for Applebees and I've got shit all in my wallet.

      The Ultimate Ultimate Frisebee Movie By Brian Anthony Skinner  List of Players:  Tim MacDonald -  Our protaganist and a charitable chap, age 27, ordinary looking, currently down on his luck. With the Professional Ultimate Frisbee league using scab players during a strike, he's had to take a job at a fast food restaurant, where he actually makes slightly more money than he did playing Ultimate Frisbee. An everyman, except he plays Ultimate Frisbee.  Pam Timmons - Tim's current girlfriend. With Tim's glamourous life as a professional athlete on hold, their relationship has grown strained. A willowy blonde, 25, her moods and wants change as quickly as the winds blow. And boy, do they blow. Currently employed as a high level thesaurus researcher, one of the fastest up and comers in the thesaurus business.  Kim Edition - The first and only female professional Ultimate Frisbee player. With the players striking for more money, and having been replaced by scabs (who draw bigger crowds than the real professionals did), she's like a boat without an anchor. Thus she's taken a job on a fishing boat, and doesn't always smell good. Has a crush on Tim, and hates Pam. Maybe hates Pam more than she likes Tim sometimes. A woman of strong likes and dislikes. A short dark haired girl, probably around 27 years old.   Jeff Willard - Tim's best friend and Ultimate Frisbee teammate. As members of the Nova Scotia Bluenoses, they have bonded over many a thrown frisbee. A tall, large fellow, he has a tendancy to tell people exactly what's on his mind, even people he doesn't know. Is living off his savings (aka, his girlfriend's money) while the union strikes. May have caused most of the problems between the union and the owners. Hates scabs with an incredible passion. Has an obssession with horses and Bruce Willis.  Mark Green - Another teammate of Tim's, whom he and Jeff hang around with and practice Ultimate Frisbee with. Former water polo player turned Ultimate Frisbeer, perhaps the greatest former water polo player turned Ultimate Frisbee player ever. Has a tendancy to not be thinking what you might think he's thinking at any particular time. Wears ridiculous hats that he thinks makes him look charismatic.  Jayne MacDonald - Tim's mother, in her mid-60s. Overprotective and nosey about everything in Tim's life. Wishes he could have followed her life's dream for him: to work in a bank as a bank teller. Those people have it all, and work so hard, from what she can tell.   Donald MacDonald - Tim's father. A former sailor. Tries not to curse like a sailor, but some circumstances deserve it. Hardly ever knows what's going on in Tim's life, but not because he doesn't care, it's just that he doesn't put much of his mind power towards anything that isn't floating on water.  Danger Dan - Or DD, Tim's cat. A black and white tuxedo cat. Is always getting in trouble off camera and occasionally just decides to sit in front of someone and meow constantly. Usually Pam. Mark thinks DD would be a great pet for adventuring around the world with, and comes up with scenerios that he and DD would live through, for reasons nobody can figure out. Mark has his own cat.   Act 1, Scene 1 to come.

      I believe I've figured out what's missing in my life. It's the fact that I've never found a daily comic strip that I can really relate to. None of them speak to ME, Brian Skinner. I don't get daily reminders of what sucks about my life in cartoon form. And I just think, that it's unfair that some people have that, and some people, such as myself, miss that in their lives.  I'll have to continue trying to fill that hole in my life the only way I know how. Writing online erotica about female celebrities who fall in love with a protaganist who is a perfect version of someone who seems something like me.   Sigh.

      What a glorious feeling, I'm happy again...  Damn it! I used a musical stuffed duck toy to calm my nephew down a few hundred times this weekend, and now I can't stop singing "Singing in the rain" while I walk around the house.  There's only one thing to do: Get it stuck in someone else's head as well.  Then  I'll feel better.  "While most of us will never be stalked by Kitty's largest relative, the tiger, it's interesting to note that the best protection is a mask worn on the back of the head. Tigers generally attack from behind, and this measure has proved effective for people who live in tiger country."  For those few of you who  don't  live in tiger country, I hope that helps you when you  do  get around tigers. Or kitty.   BOLD!

      "Being on stage, in my lingerie, is my dream come true". Is that anyone's dream come true? Really? It's shooting slightly below 'Rich uncle I didn't know died and left me a fortune because he thought my name sounded better than the rest of his kin. My name? Rudolph.'  I just realized that I have at least 4 different cheap card game software CD-ROMS sitting around that I've gotten over various Christmi(the plural for Christmas) that I've never played. Apparently the fact that "he seems to like computers" draws people to the bargain bin of computer software at Best Buy when they think of me during the holidays.  At least they're thinking of me at Best Buy. It's a good start. It's not like I would play expensive games either, as I do enough things through work and such on the computer that playing games on it seems overmuch of much things.  But my "Interactive World Map on CD-ROM" will some day come in handy. I'm sure.  I honest to God had to pull out long grass by hand today when a mower broke. For no good reason that I can think of, it's the most frustrating act in the world. Oh well.

      I go a little while without posting anything and all of a sudden blogger.com has a nice new interface that confuses and scares me. But I'm easily confused and scared. Or I just ate something that's not sitting in my stomach right. Either way, I'm queasy a lot. A LOT.  Got some of my first "parent training" this last weekend. It was Jody and my first overnight babysitting of my "new" nephew, Maximilian. 2.5 months is still pretty new, right? I learned a lot...like how I love to sleep, and how if I did have a newborn infant, that I need more than basic cable. We babysat at my mother-in-law's house (cause she's got all the baby caring for goods that you need) while she was away on vacation, and she doesn't have nearly enough channels. At 4 am, informericals for painful looking exercise machines aren't entertaining enough as you're passing the time thinking "if he just stays asleep in my lap 5 more minutes, I'll be SO happy...".    Anyway, we all survived, so my sister-in-law didn't kill me in vengence for her child. Plus he's a cute little dude, so that helped the hours go by at night.  urlLink He's my little buddy  and we got along great, when he's not grabbing my chest hair. Okay, even when's grabbing my chest hair we get along great.   But my wife and I decided, hey, lots of people wait until their 30s to have kids these days, that sounds like a good fad to jump aboard. And then we slept for many, many hours.  It's Memorial Day in America this weekend. It's one of those American holidays that, as a Canadian, I'm unfamiliar with. But after a few years here now, I've decided to buy a barbeque (or grill, whatever they call it these'a'days) and meat for this weekend, and hold some sort of getogether, so people don't look at me funny and say "lookit there at the Canadian, he's not eating charred beef today, so he's disrespecting what we're supposed to be respecting on Memorial day! Let's toss things at him, like objects and disparaging remarks about his genetic makeup!" or some such nonsense. I surely don't want to not go against the flow.  Other than that, I can't think of a damn thing to say.

      Someone put a complaint into my rental townhome (Oh, I'm so much better than a rental apartment...I have a personal garage and direct entry...no hallways for me, bub!) that we were slamming doors. But it was the people next to us while they were moving in. I bet it was old people who complained...they always complain but they're too old to get facts specifically correct...that's the last time I wave at them when they walk by walking their old dog. Old oldy jerk jerks. Luckily I snitched on my neighbours and now I'm not in trouble!  See...snitching, in real life, not in school, gets the heat off YOU, and thus is GOOD. Don't get kicked out of your luxury rental townhome because you weren't a snitch.  LUXURY! We have a tennis court and a gym! And we only have to share it with about 300 other people! Capital L, baby!  A gorilla tried to kill my wife yesterday. Only impossible to break plexiglass kept her from sure gorilla destruction. She has yet to divulge to me what the fuck she did to piss off that gorilla. I won't take her fear  of the moment as an excuse for no answer! Because I'm too good a husband.  And that's what I've learned after over two years of marriage. No matter how scared your wife was from a near gorilla death encounter, you MUST taunt her for the rest of the day, else you don't get husbandly respect.

      I got an email today from Mr. Massive. I didn't open it, but I can only assume that only good news comes from someone named Mr. Massive. Mr. Skinner assumes Mr. Massive has high self worth.  I got your link all fixed up, Nebel. So if for God knows what reason you're reading this, and haven't gotten some Nebel in your diet, check out the link off to the side.  But I'm pretty sure nobody is reading this. Not even Mr. Massive. He's got better things and people to do.

      BELLAIRE, Texas - A truck carrying 30,000 pounds of eggs spilled its contents off a Houston-area overpass early Monday, shutting down a highway and leaving a smelly mess behind for cleanup crews.   The accident happened about 2:30 a.m. when an 18-wheeler ran into some plastic barrels along the Interstate 610 loop. As the trailer went up onto the rails of the overpass, the eggs were sent tumbling onto an unoccupied Transportation Department truck parked at a construction site below.   Police believe the truck's driver may have fallen asleep. The driver, whose name was not immediately released, broke his nose, but no other injuries were reported.   "There must have been 50 cases of eggs that landed on that (parked) truck, crushed the cab and broke the windshield," said Gary Babb, a supervisor in charge of the cleanup.   Environmental workers spent the day cleaning up the mess, trying not to slip on egg yolks as they worked. A special substance was used to battle the smell and soak up spilled fuel.   It took more than 14 hours to clean up the spill and reopen the highway. Babb's co-workers brought food to keep the crew's energy up, but he didn't exactly appreciate it.   "They brought us scrambled eggs, you believe that?" Babb said. "Sick sense of humor, these people."

      LUSAKA (Reuters) - A 50-year-old Zambian man has hanged himself after his wife found him having sex with a hen, police said Friday.   The woman caught him in the act when she rushed into their house to investigate a noise.   "He attempted to kill her but she managed to escape," a police spokesman said.   The man from the town of Chongwe, about 50 km (30 miles) east of Lusaka, killed himself after being admonished by other villagers.   The hen was slaughtered after the incident.

      My new favourite saying is "I'm worried and full". I think that sums up how I feel most of the time.  I have a need to type out this thing I'm looking at: "The Powerful Taste Deterrent Invented by a pharmacist".&nbsp;  God bless those pharmacists. *wipes tear from eye*  My wife's boss is having Japanese exchange students stay with her and she's never even watched Iron Chef. She's afraid to take them to the grocery store because she thinks they'll stare at all our different kinds of rice for an hour and she doesn't have that kind of time because she's a busy woman.&nbsp; Seriously, she was worried about that. So she thought taking them to Sam's Club instead of a grocery store would be a better solution, because there's more stuff, but less variety.  My wife doesn't believe in lactose intolerance. I&nbsp; think I've mentioned that before, but it needs rementioning. Because I don't have many original things to say here.  Does anyone know what's fun to do around the Dayton area of Ohio? Fun and cheap would be a good combo as well.

      I've had card & board games 2 for like, 2 years, without installing it on my computer. Jody and I got it for Christmas from her father, but as soon as he gave it to us he said "but you might not want to install it because I hear it's full of spyware". Then why did he give it to us? To teach us a valuable lesson about gifts that have spyware. I would say that maybe he should have just given us a real set of cards, but that would be a crappy gift, so I won't say that. Plus he gave us some towels that were nice and fluffy, which we needed, because we had a new home, and new homes need nice and fluffy towels. But they were a dark pink, which matches no one's bathroom, so they shouldn't be even made, but that's Target's fault. Not mine.   I don't know what to do with my broken cellphone. It's been broken for a half year, half of which I actually paid for it's service because I thought I might get a new battery for it. Then I realized I wouldn't. Then I realized that I don't like talking to people on the phone, so I didn't call and try to go through the hassle of cancelling it. So I paid for a phone because I hate using the phone. Well, not physically, just because of my generalized anxiety disorder. Or GAD. I'm nervous about doing anything. Because of that and my hate to do anything disorder.&nbsp;Or HTDAD.&nbsp; But now the phone just sits there, useless, but I can't bring myself to even store it away. The thing cost too much to not at least look at it glancingly for two years. Sort of like any of the thick expensive reference books we have in the house.  I try to justify my not neat unless someone is visiting&nbsp;apartment/townhouse by thinking "well, if I had a house, it would be easier to keep clean. There's more room so less clutter." But of course with more room, there's more space to clean. But I don't like thoughts like those, so I divert my mind to what it would be like to be a ninja turtle. Because that's a much more important thought.  One night, a few years back, when I was back in Nova Scotia, probably dreaming of what it would be like to be a ninja turtle, my brother awoke me with a scream. Not just any scream. A terror scream. A "my brother is currently dying because a monster is stabbing him with his claws" scream. My brother's room was in the room down in the basement below me, so I had a good ear vantage point. So at 4 in the morning I went from deep sleep to down in the basement checking on my brother in 5 seconds flat. Very flat. It seems my brother, my 28 year old brother, had a bad waking dream. He woke up, and thought he heard little footsteps coming into his room from another room. Then he looked at the entrance to his bedroom, and he saw a little boy staring back at him. So he got out of the bed to touch what he was sure had to be a illusion. And when he went and touched the boy, he FELT the boy. And then he screamed like he was dying.&nbsp;   I mention that story so I can mention this: my big brother is a wuss.   And that was the point of this entire post. Kind of.  &nbsp;

      Well, let's see. I caught the stove on fire today. And I learned something about myself: I hate the sound of smoke detectors.&nbsp; That and I freeze when confronted with huge flames. Not freeze in the sort of ice/cold sort of way, but in a "stand there and breath in lots of fire smoke" sort of way.  Eventually the fire did go out, only leaving much of my stove blackened. And after a half hour the smoke detector went off, but not before people in the building thought that maybe I was going to destroy their homes. And not before I made my lungs be in much pain from much smoke.  But the food tasted good. I guess burning hamburgers a little bit don't hurt so much.  But my arms are exhausted from waving a pillow at the smoke detector for a half hour.  So it's&nbsp;sort of a 50/50 situation. Usually cooking hamburgers doesn't get my arms enough exercise, or so I always was thinking when I was cooking hamburgers in the past.  What was my point?  Oh yeah, I'm an idiot who starts grease fires and almost burns down his home.  I've got to go mentally punish myself for a few hours. Until then, stay frosty.

      Last night, just before I went to bed, I went to get a drink, to wet my proverbial whistle. While looking in the fridge, I noticed our hotdogs. Not just any hotdogs, but speciality Ballpark Grillers hotdogs. More expensive in that there are less hotdogs per pack than usual hotdogs, because they're supposedly gourmet hotdogs, of some sort. We had decided to get them (because of a coupon) but save them for special grilling occasions, rather than eat them raw when we're hungry and short on time between meals. Not that I do that, but some people do. Really, I don't. I'm anti-raw. I even only eat toast.  Well, not really, toast takes too long to make. But the rest was true.  Back to my important point. I saw the hotdogs. And then I realized, hey, I had dreamed about those hotdogs the other night. In that, I dreamt that I had noticed that there were more hotdogs in the package than we had originally thought.  So I rushed back to bed next to my sleeping wife and had to mention it, even though she was probably too asleep to pay attention. But remembered dreams are something you just have that incredible urge to share with someone.  But then I realized, hey, I was dreaming about hotdogs. That's not something to let my wife know. I'm a happily married man!  Between you and me, it was only because I had gone to bed hungry that night, having only ate a barely filled pita wrap that day.  Hey, I'm on a diet.  But that's the only reason. And if you tell anyone otherwise, or anything about this story, I will find you and give you an atomic noogie.

      Weird, crazy, hectic week. You have no idea. Mainly because I'm not going to tell you. "You" being the fictional person who is reading this. It's amazing how life can go from "boy I'm bored, and I'm tired of watching 30 Minute Meals on the Food Network...is Tyler Florence hosting yet another show?" to "How did I end up in a waiting area of a hospital I didn' t know existed reading a free newspaper that's all about herbalism and how the God of Light and Sound can heal your soul?". Well, maybe not amazing, but looking back from a Thursday (because looking back on Friday or Saturday is the domain of those whom aren't unemployed) I can feel that way on my own vanity page.  Thus I needed some good quality ice cream and a Dr. Pepper, to normalize. Not that I normally have either of those, but sometimes getting something I don't usually have (to eat, or to swat at) normalizes me in a way that the same old same old wouldn't.  Oh well, I think I'll just look at my Globe, circa pre-WW2 and see what countries existed/didn't exist then, until I'm tired enough to sleep, or bored enough to do something else to make me tired enough to sleep. Either shouldn't take long.

      I'm tired, but I'm not TIRED-tired. You know? I know if I go to bed now, I'll only half sleep and wake up a thousand times at every little noise my cat's make. But they're asleep now, waiting for me to try to sleep to wake up. It's a tightrope I'm walking right now. And if I don't sleep well, then I'll be grumpy tomorrow, and then my wife will be grumpy at me, and then Friday is ruined. Fridays are not for ruining. So I'm trying to do boring, unstimulating things that keep me awake, but are slowly making me really sleepy. Such as writing this, and searching the internet reading about stupid things.  &nbsp;  Such as:  (1) CSI people being fired. Young people and their need for so much money, it's outlandish.  (2) Price of Season 3 of the "Trailer Park Boys" DVD. Like I had money or something.  (3) The Justice Society of America. Because I felt nerdish though I've never bought a comic in my life. Though I coloured on some of my brother's old Spider-Mans when I was a kid. Though I never knew why he owned comic books, since he's a wannabe jock (aka. He played volleyball and soccer). Maybe he was trying to impress the WRONG CROWD. You know of whom I speak.  (4) Checking all my magazine subscriptions, and fretting that they're all expiring. What else am I going to do to pass time on the treadmill?  (5) Seeing what the weather is like. Because it's dark outside and I don't know if that sound is rain, or someone spraying my townhouse with a hose.  (6) Seeing if I could buy groceries online. I could. But I don't want to.  (7) Looking up my name on Google AND Google Groups. No one cares about me.  (8) Seeing if I sold that SCTV book on half.com in the middle of the night. I had.  (9) Random things on Yahoo images, like my name, and the name of my friends, and of celebrities who's names I spell wrong.  (10) The price of that book and CD I want. Like I have money.  (11) All 100 of my email accounts. It seems like it some days. One day someone will actually email my google email account, I'm sure. And then there's my business email. And my personal. And my personal 2. And the one I collect junk mail in.  (12) Other blogs, to see if people are leading more interesting lives than me. They are. Like I have money or something.  (13) Canada news, but the webpage opened to slowly, and I forgot what was loading, and then I thought of something else I wanted to see, so I opened that webpage instead before I forgot what my thought was.  (14) Ratemykitten.com, to see how my cats are doing. They're doing much better than I would on one of those amihot.com things. Not that I think my cats are hot.  (15) Briefly looking at newsgroups, but then losing my concentration, because I'm finally getting tired.  (16) Looked at my onw weblog, then looked to see how many people had visited my profile, then changed the title and tagline of the blog to something&nbsp; I'm only 20% satisfied with. I know I can do dumber and vainer than what I came up with. (17) Trying to write this entry with some purpose, and then forgetting it because I'm finally getting tired. And then remembering that was the purpose, and being happy and sedated.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      There's not a whole lot going on with me right now...I've had two job interviews in a row go to nothing because the job ended up not actually being made into existance, so I'm finding new ways to not get a job, but other than that, everything is status quo.  We spent most of the weekend watching Season 1 & 2 of "Trailer Park Boys" on DVD, along with going to a rose garden park to see the world's worst improv group. If you have to tell everyone to applaud every 3 minutes because what you're doing is just getting blank stares of "I'm wasting my time with this?", there's something wrong with your act. And doing the guilt trip of "it's harder than you think just thinking of anything to say, we're improving. Improving! We're an improv group!" doesn't work either. I know you're improving...it says so on that black and pink banner behind you. But it was free, and the roses were pretty, and dogs barked at each other, as all good dogs do. Plus I was grumpy. And hot. And there were little mites of insects biting me. Plus I wanted ice cream.  And then I got ice cream! And things were good. With my marshmellow sundae, no one knew that I had toppings but me! Intrigue!  My mother is very anti-catnip. Not that she's pro-cat, but just thinks that anything that makes your pet high, isn't a good thing to be in existance.

      My nephew, Max, got some baby photos taken yesterday. Well, actually, his parents got the pictures taken, and he was tied down and distracted so that they didn't turn out all crying and squirming. But they just weren't any photos, they were those special theme, baby boudior (sp?) photos with all the sailor hats and the "gone fishin'" type pictures. Now it's time for auntie and uncie to pick out the photo we want to to put up at our place for years of viewing.  I have one rule: No butt shots.  Yes, baby bare butts are cute, but we want this photo up for many years, mainly because changing out wall art is difficult and time consuming when I'm trying to watch television for God's sake. And there's nothing much more embarassing for a teenage guy then going to their aunt's house and seeing their baby ass on the wall. I love my nephew too much to put him through that sort of pain. He will get cheek pinches though, I can't save him from that.  I think I've actually won that argument as well. Because I present arguments in logical ways that can't be argued against...and I never, ever shut up until I get my way. MY WAY!

      I embarassed myself when I almost choked on a gummi-worm today. Mind you, I was by myself, and by almost choked, I mean only a small part when down my throat for about .2 seconds with minimal chewing. But I thought I was going to die. Luckily no one saw my fear.  But I can still feel it where it went down, like a gummi-shadow pain.  It's tough being me.

      Well, I just got back from a trip to Nova Scotia. And by "just got back", I mean, two Saturdays ago. Jet lag, it can a long time to get over. There's a whole two hour difference.  It was my best friend's wedding (like the movie, except, I wasn't marrying him by the end of it) and I almost didn't make it. I had to decline being in the wedding party because I didn't think I'd be able to get up for the wedding. Then a week before, with some help from my mother, I got tickets to get there, and arrive less than an hour before the wedding, with a half hour drive from the airport to the church. So I flew with my ill-fitting dress shirt and tie (45 pounds ago it was nice and snug) through beautiful Detroit, and onto beautiful Halifax. Luckily I'm still short and chubby enough to look stupid in a tux, so maybe it was better for everyone that I couldn't make it into the wedding party.  Though severely dehydrated (damn you airline delicious pretzels!) and tired giddy from being up at 4 am to make the 3:30 pm wedding, I had a good time. I got to see my two best friends for the first time in years. Though thanks to my timing of being up the week after the wedding, my one friend obviously went on his honeymoon to beautiful Cuba, and my other friend had to get back to work in beautiful Ottawa the day after the wedding. And my wife Jody couldn't come along, so I decided to save all the "vacation" aspects of a trip home for next Christmas or next Summer. So I basically just hung around with my Mom, which is what she wanted anyway, cause I'm the baby of the family and it kills her that I'm in far off beautiful Minneapolis....where she can't nag me about drinking too much pop. But I had to drink more pop there, they don't have Lime Pop here, and I miss it so much.  Actually I spent most of the vacation eating junk food that you can't get in Minnesota, and watching the Euro Championship of Soccer, which costs $30 a game here, but was on free tv back home.  btw, the flight through Detroit was so much better than through Toronto, as last time I had to go through an hour long international customs line in Toronto. This time my first point of entry was Halifax, and I had a 5 minute line. Plus I only brought carry-on luggage, and I checked-in online, so I was super time saver Mister Travel Man.  I missed Swiss Chalet and Harveys so much. Harveys makes your hamburger a beautiful thing.  Anyway, I came back here and got a job interview, and I bought a new tie and dress shirt, and the going out of business Mervyns. I loves it when businesses go under, because of VALUES! Anyway, they ended up not hiring for that position (which doesn't make it hurt less...*sniff*), but they should have hired me, because my tie is georgeous. Man-Georgeous. And 20% off. You can't beat those deals.  And there was grilling, fireworks, and such on the 4th of July, and on the 1st of July (Canada Day). Actually, I missed Canada Day in Canada, but I did grill, and I did get cheap Canada shirts on sale at Sears. Quality Sears T-Shirts rule. So in the end, most things turned out good. Mostly.  But the main thing was that I got to make a lasting impression on my 6 year old cousin Sarah. My mother has, for reasons unknown, a big fridge magnet that says "Don't Mess with Texas" over the texas flag. I think she might have gotten it with a package of texas toast, but I'm not sure. It doesn't quite mix with her usual array of magnets that are mostly advertisements for paving companies and poems about the experience of being a mother or sister. But anyway, there's this old magnet there from my youth that says "Brian's Notes", and I got little Sarah to promise me that every time she visits my mother, she had to make sure that the magnets were aligned to say "Brian's Notes: Don't Mess with Texas", because really, you shouldn't. She was very excited about the whole operation, and has apparently not stopped talking about it since I left. So I got to teach a impressionable youth a very important lesson.  Don't Mess With Texas.  I'm not sure she even knows where/what Texas is. But she'll learn, and she'll remember.

      Sorry for the strong language last post, but I've been suffering from rhoid rage.   I had to do all kinds of physicals to prove I can get the job this week (ending up with some weird guy putting water on my nipples to have this bondage strap pick up my heart rate)...so it's been an odd week, with the pain bothering everything. It'd be fun to say "yeah, great, I passed all the physicals to show that I can do the job...now can I take a day off because I can't endure sitting for more than 5 minutes?"  Lousy lack of health insurance.  And the worst encouragement you can hear at times like these is things like hearing your Mother say "oh, those. Yeah, your father used to get them all the time.".  Stupid genetics. Yay for the next 40 years of ass pain.

      Well, I finally got a job. Money shall be nice. I can finally get back to my life's calling: lowest level office job possible that no one in the company respects. Ah...it feels good.  Actually, it's contingent upon me passing a drug/alcohol test, which shouldn't be hard because I neither drink nor do drugs, however, it's at 7 am in the morning, and I would hope I wasn't too hopped up at that time of day.  Oh, and I have to pass a physical. Hopefully they allow wusses into their ranks.  But finally, I can go out and have that celebratory dinner I've been planning for EIGHT FUCKING MONTHS. Jesus Christ, am I THAT unemployable. I have a HR degree, damn it! College is spos'da do good things for people like me. I'm white, even if I'm in a foreign land. I even got rid of my Nova Scotian accent for you jackasses!  What do you want from your "High school/GED needed" jobs??  My belly is so full of hate right now.  *uses the bathroom*  There, musch musch better.  Yay for money!

      We did Summer Cleaning over the weekend and into the early week, and now I'm afraid that we're going to have the fullest garbage on our little block of townhomes area. That's always embarassing to me...I'm sure they're all looking at me like "Oh, you had that much shit in your house? So that's where the smells were coming from. I bet everything that annoys me about this complex is coming from your  home, because you obviously live in shitty conditions, or at least did until you threw all that stuff out". Not that I let my paranoia run too wild or anything, that's just what I think about everyone else who has large amounts of garbage, and people obviously think the same as me.  I yelled at people all night in my dreams, and now I feel out of breath all morning. Pity poor me.  Jody and I are addicted to Celebrity Poker on Bravo. It's all we do on Thursday nights. Well, we do chores while it's on, but it's a lovely background to a night of laundry and "I don't know, what do YOU want for dinner?".

      I just wish there were more chances to make BIG MONEY QUICK on the internet right now. I could use that.  Update: Great, someone already emailed me about it. And I hadn't even finished writing this post. The internet IS a wonder tool.
