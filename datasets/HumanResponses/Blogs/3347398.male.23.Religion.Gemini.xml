      Hearing all the crap that is going on with the photos and junk about the in-humane treatment we've been giving those Iraqi prisoners.  I never thought about getting online and looking at the pictures that have been posted all over the web, til today.   I saw pictures of those who were being "mistreated", and at first I was blown away at how someone could be so cruel. I am not getting political or anything..but.. After reading the article and a few other stories surrounding this small topic in US headlines.  I came to the realization that, putting myself in the American Soldiers shoes who have to go into battle, with these "rules of engagement" that they abide by.  I can't say that I'd want to humiliate them for all the crap that they've brought on by killing even their own citizens.  When I played football, or any sport at that, and there's an opponent who is cheating, or winning by playing dirty.  Myself having to watch something like this from the sidelines, wait in anticipation to get on the playing field so that I can do WHATEVER IT TAKES to put that person in their place for all the crap they've caused.  I would persist until I saw that person pay the price.  In this case, the only revenge our US soldiers see fit, without killing these prisoners, is humiliating them to a point where they wish they were dead.  Hundreds of other countries don't even take prisoners, they  kill them.  All we are doing is tormenting these individuals, we're not beheading them! I am very aware that there is a huge picture that I am not seeing.  I don't try to educate myself too much on the things going on in Iraq, by the time I figure out whats going on, the war will have been over for a few years.

      Tonight Eufaula High School had their graduation.  All but 2 seniors showed up.  I've been at FBC Eufaula for right at a month.  I was told that all but 2 showing up was great compared to some past showings.  Just Wednesday night we cancelled church so that all the church members could attend the Baccaloreate.  Out of the 82 Students to graduate this week, only 35 showed for this service.  When I was in High School, it wasn't mandatory that we show, but you defenitely would hear about it if you didn't.  I graduated with around 400 students, I can't recall any of them missing the Baccaloreate services.  For myself when I was a senior just 4 years ago, this was a big deal for me to be a part of all the activities surrounding graduation.  Why would I not want to show? I don't know, maybe their experiences in high school here just stunk? It baffles me that parents don't straighten there kids up and at least make an attempt to show for these simple, yet refreshing services!  My folks would have flipped had they found out I didn't go to my Baccaloreate service.  Of course they were there, so that would have made it much worse.  Maybe we're not the only school like this, in face i'm sure there is worse out there.

      CAMP REVOLUTION WAS LAST WEEK FOR OUR STUDENTS HERE AT FIRST BAPTIST OF EUFAULA.  WE WERE ANTICIPATING A BIG WEEK ALL WEEK WITH OUR KIDS WHO HAD NEVER PARTICIPATED IN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.  NEVER DID I EXPECT THIS BIG OF AN IMPACT TO HAPPEN ON MY STUDENTS.  WE TOOK 17 STUDENTS, WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD FOR OUR FIRST YEAR, TO CAMP.  OUT OF THOSE 17 THERE WERE 10 DECISIONS MADE, 8 OF THEM WERE SALVATIONS!  NOW DURING THE EVENING SERVICES I COULDN'T SIT WITH MY STUDENTS, I HAD TO SCURRY UP THE HILL AND PREPARE FOR POST-SERVICE ACTIVITIES.  2 OF THE NIGHTS I WAS SWARMED BY A LARGE NUMBER OF KIDS, TURNS OUT ALL WERE NEW BELIEVERS, ONLY A FEW MINUTES OLD!  LONG STORY SHORT, GOD REALLY MADE LAST WEEK A MARKER FOR ME, MY FIRST GROUP BY MYSELF, AND THIS BIG OF A TURNOUT, MY NEW GOAL IS TO WIN MORE SOULS TO CHRIST PERCENTAGEWISE THAN WE DID IN OUR GROUP ALONE LAST WEEK.  WE HAD 48% OF OUR KIDS RECEIVE CHRIST. HOW AWESOME!  I THANK GOD FOR HIS MANY BLESSINGS HE HAS BESTOWED UPON THIS CHURCH AND STUDENT MINISTRY.
