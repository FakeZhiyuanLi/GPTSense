      yesterday was one of the best days and nights of my life... even if andrew couldn't be there but it's alright and on that note, i'd like to thank christine for her poor motor skills when she drinks but her ability to think straight, without which i'd probably still be in the dark about something, LOOOOOVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEE YYYYYYYOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUU SSSSSSSSSSTIIIIINNNNNNEEEEEEE... so yesterday we went to the mall, i bought sooo much stuff i said to stine "make sure i never shop that much ever again" and she was like "i don't know if it's harder to take the mall or alcohol away from you" and i was like oooo man... lol... while we were there we saw the drummer from sn, and we just like always happen 2 see him places, so i go "kusky" only i didn't mean to say it that loudly but uhhh i did so then everyone over in his group looks at me so i was like SUPERNOTHING so that i didn't look as weird as if i was just like a stalker lol but then we said soemthing to drew he called me dumb like he always does lol.. then later he was online and drew was like yeah me and kusky are arguing over who's cooler i'm like  it's kusky because we saw him at the mall.. kusky appparently agreed with us but probably thinks we're reallllllly weird lol.. so then we all went home where we tried to figure out who was driving to the movies.. then my mom wound up taking, even after taking and bringing home from the mall i guess she was just in a good mood lol.. we saw paycheck it was soooo awesome.. then we went back 2 stine's... her parents went to bed relatively early last night it was weird so we were drinking by like 12:15.. someone was supposed to come over but decided that it would be better that someone else went to him instead... so off me and the other person went at 2 o'clock `in the fuckin morning` lol... hung around there for like 45 min and i got to talk 2 drew the whole time which was cool.. went back home, talked 2 drew some more, then something really weird happened, i was like typing stuff and looking at the comp and not remembering typing it soooo odd lol.. then we sat around for awhile and just talked.. then layed down and swore we were going to bed.. first lin fell asleep, then riss, then me and stine at 6... woke up this morning, had breakfast, came home and slept my ass off... and now i'm bored so i'll probably go back 2 bed before getting in the shower....

      ok so things got better... my mother finally dragged me out of my room to get my presents so i did and they were alright.. then thank god christine and tom saved me.. we went for a walk it was fun.. then i came back home and opened more presents and i got good stuff.. i'm waiting till tomorrow (this) morning to go through my stocking because i'm weird and think that's the best part of christmas lol.. it's like 4 fucking o clock and i can't sleep.. my knee hurts like a bitch so that may be why... tomorrow night i may go to the movies with christine and tom (as long as we can get a ride) because none of us want to be stuck with our families although it's just mi padres, mi hermano, mi abuela and my aunt (can't think of that in spanish right now lol).. maybe i'll go try on all my clothes that i got for xmas :-)...  song of the moment: ex-girlfriend ~no doubt

      haven't posted since tues. so this is what's happened..   wed. : school and gymnastics   thurs. : school, gymnastics dinner: i'm gonna miss the seniors sooo much, we had a lot of fun.. chilled with rach, stine and tom   fri. : school and linden high botb.. we got there late (my fault sorry guys) and missed mrd project but apparently they weren't good (chris's words lol).. international orange had a good set as usual.. useless knowledge was amazing, even though delia was sick they had probably their best set ever and almost won.. three under six is always good but it wasn't their best show and i thought they were grossly underscored but whatev and the plus side is i got one of cliff's drumsticks so now all i need is metta's pick if he uses one and i've got the entire band lol.. three left turns was good (me lin and stine had seen them at krome already too) but it looked like they didn't have all their fans there so that kinda sucked for them.. SUPERNOTHING was fucking awesome, they opened with like a hip hop medley sorta thing and it was good, they played the end and underacheivers among other things and didn't get to play with or without you bc they said they didn't have time and if stanch forgets my cd at the next show imma kill him lol and then andrew gave me his shirt so i got happy again.. a match like memory went on last and they were good, i'd listened to them b4 on purevolume.com so i kinda knew what they sounded like, they use adam kopec (from sn) as a guitar player so that was cool.. sn won, big surprise there lol.. then a couple other things happened but it all worked out.. then me and rach went back to stine's house, stine thank you for making me stop drinking i love you!!!!! oh and we talked to andrew (from sn)'s friend for awhile and we talked to stanch who told us SUPERNOTHING IS STAYING TOGETHER..   sat. : woke up, paid homage to the porcelain god lol, went to work, chilled with ali and eric for a bit and then went to the dance, i wasn't going to go but it was a lot of fun, i got to dance with chris.. like 6 rock songs came on and for those it was the guys in bands, some of their friends and me and my friends jumping around and screaming the songs while the rest of the cyo stood there and looked at us like we were on coke lol.. all in all it was a great night  now i'm supposed to be doing my bio project which i haven't started yet but hey whatev i'll get it done..  song of the moment: always ~saliva

       "I remember when you said everything is gonna be alright" ~Good Charlotte   today.. absolutely nothing.. school... apparently marissa's mother thinks i'm going to screw up my life, and christine's mom thinks my mom doesn't know what goes on, but shows how much she knows considering my mom knew we were drinking in stine's basement last summer and all stine's mom knows as of now is that we have drank.. uh huh, whatev.. i'm still in denial that it's not summer yet, but second semester always goes faster than first so i guess all will be good, esp. since the only class i will have to think in is bio.. it's kinda sad to say that lol.. tonight i booked the place for my sweet sixteen, the guy who handeled it was 28, saw my varsity jacket, said "oh so you're a gymnast?" and on top of it we all know renee's rep w/ older guys.. too bad it's all illegal and shit lol.. oh well, guess there's no more for tonight  song of the moment: daddy's little defect ~sugarcult

       "This is a lesson in procrastination, I kill myself because I'm so frustrated" ~Brand New   procrastinating again.. whatev..  wed.: school, no gym  thurs.: snow day SCORE.. guess what i did, shouldn't be of any surprise to those who know me lol.. then i went to gymnastics practice, lemme give you an idea of what it was like: (me thinking, god, let me do a back handspring and not die) "renee what is making you move so slowly?" as said by my coach.. ahh, interesting to say the least  fri.: school, out w/ fer for a lil, the cove was awesome, mrd kicked ass, then i drove around w/ joe, rach, stine and tom for awhile, well first we followed sal home which surprisingly enough wasn't my idea lol.. then we just went around for awhile  sat.: work, then to julie's, oh man, ron is cute (did you know you can hear everything through those vents?!), met vic sa, it wound up being me, lin, chrissy, connie, stine, chris, sal, jorge, vic sa, riss, and i think that's it, well and of course julie.. then at 10:30 joe picked me, chris, and sal up.. so it was me chris sal kelli martini and daniela.. kelli sat on my lap for the like entire drive lol.. they left me chris and sal at south mountain and let me tell you, i didn't have a jacket on, that was not the funnest game in the world, sal gave me his though and then he was standing there with like just a tshirt lol.. then went home  sun.: meet in the morning, got pissed at luis when i got there, wanted 2 leave, but here's how the events went: vault: 8.3, not bad, first place bars: 6.5, fell on the squat on, i thought luis was gonna put a hole in my head, but then i figured out that if i got like an 8.0 on beam and an 8.2 on floor i'd still get that a score... beam: stuck my routine, but i def. dismounted from my roundoff with my feet on the side of the beam, 8.3, first place floor: all i needed was a 7.9 but i was kinda iffy.. pulled out the greatest routine of my life (in my opinion) and got an 8.4, stuck my full and everything, first place all-around: 31.5, first a score of the season ::does happy dance::, second place but they like didn't give me a medal :-( it was upsetting lol then, went home, showered, went to stine's w/ tom and andrew and kropp were there, then we went and did some more shit, went to rachel's, joe showed up there, then we met chris and sal later for like 45 min  today: hung out w/ stine and andrew, just chilled, then practice, now i'm home and i should be doing my outline (which was due last thurs.), i haven't even showered yet and i smell like a beast  tomorrow is school, then home for my lazy ass to do nothing.. or maybe something, i don't know lol, my most recent goal is: never stay home if you can help it.... friday i might see typecaste at the cove but i'm not sure, i hafta work sat night till close so maybe a bit of driving around after that and sunday morning-afternoon.. work sucks ass but a plus is i didn't get in trouble for the bad evaluation i got.. alright now that i have a post that's like the amount of text a normal person has in their entire blogger, i'm done, i hafta shower dude  song of the moment: the boy who blocked his own shot ~brand new ``and if it makes you less sad i'll die by your hand i hope you find out what you want i already know what i am and if it makes you less sad we'll start talking again and you can tell me how vile i already know that i am...... it's cold as a tomb and it's dark in your room when i sneak to your bed to pour salt in your wounds``

      no this isn't directed at anyone but i like the quote.. monday was an average day in school, slept all afternoon when i got home, went to the gym at night.. tuesday in crafts class the most adorable kid started talking to me i was pretty souped and the good mood has carried over.. yesteday i slept all afternoon too.. today i went to school and it was chill, then i came home and slept, then i went to christine's and we watched american history x, i don't understand how everyone loves that movie, yes, it was filled with excellent actors and had amazing direction and was a good movie, but it was deeply disturbing and i don't think i'll ever be able to watch it again. it freaked me out to the point where i'm still thinking about it. the end was like the saddest thing ever. okay i have to stop thinkinga bout it.  song of the moment: soco amaretto lime ~brand new

       "Just tell me why you're here and who you are" ~Michelle Branch   kinda long time no blog. there really hasn't been anything new going on except i went to skate and surf, it was amazing. i got on the stage for the early november, so that was fun. went back to school that monday and everything was normal. this past weekend i went to a sweet sixteen for bev on friday, and then saturday i got my tattoo and a prom dress. it worked out pretty well. sunday i went tux shopping with will, his mom's really cool. yesterday in school i did, like, nothing. then i went to work and taught a karate class and that was different to say the least lol. last night i went to the mall with kristen katelyn and ruben, good times. today i went to school, it was eh, then i came home and showed tom my dress, he approves. then i tried to sleep but like joe called me and i'm flipping out trying to find the phone. when i couldnt' find it i was like ok they'll call my cell whoever it was but they didn't. i fell asleep again and five minutes later my phone rings. it was joe. ha ha ha. anyway, we went out to get some stuff and then we drove around for awhile just talking about things. i was insanely exhausted this morning because porter had me on the phone till one last night, not that i mind all that much lol. uhh well i'm about done, i have nothing else to write. except that i'm seeing yellowcard and something corporate on thursday and i'm pumped about that. lol.  song of the moment: all you wanted ~michelle branch

       "Nothing that you do is new to anything or anyone but you" ~Brand New   i was reading old entries. some of them i truly was happy. most not though. i'm reading over my surveys and that other nonsense and the guy thing was out of control for a period of time. now i don't know where i'm going or what i'm doing with my life and it's kind of sad. i think i'm judging things by the guy thing too much at the moment but i don't know how to feel about anything and it's really confusing me. i want to go to bed and not think about it but i can't cause i have to do my math homework. i don't know i'm just really confused about everything. for awhile everything was like drink and smoke all the time, now i don't want to do that, i just want to be a normal teenage girl who does homework and has a boyfriend and all that other stuff, you know? ahh. i don't know.  song of the moment: ocean avenue ~yellowcard  ``we were both sixteen and it felt so right sleeping all day staying up all night``

       "I hate everything about you, Why do I love you?" ~Three Days Grace   so like.. spring break... not as eventful as winter break but it was decent nonetheless.  i got kinda confused about myself this break.  guy-wise i guess.  idk.  the song quote describes how i'm feeling i guess.  tonight we went to the mall, i forgot my money at home so i was screwed but we had fun, i broke up with marissa in the food court lol.  after the mall we went to the gates of hell and i thought joe had my phone so i'm like wtf sal didn't call me but sal did call me and joe didn't have my phone. anyway, so we're heading down the tracks cause we wanna go anyway and i'm like i wanna make sure that we don't scare each other if chris n sal are in the tunnel, and i try to call but can't get anyone, so anyway we're behind the tracks and we see a flashlight and i'm like that must be them.  we kept going and trying to call out their names but i guess they didn't hear us too well or something.  we go down and they're there and all and we all go in and it took like forever for everyone to get some balls but we got in, then we had to decide who wanted to walk through the water and it wound up being me, chris, sal, cliff, jackie and mario (leading the way lol because apparently he has to go first since we don't care if he dies lmao) and we're walking and we start hearing shit. it took us like 30 min to get through this tiny portion of the tunnel but it was nonetheless fun, except i got soaked, and my boobs and ass got molested like the whole time lol. then we got lost for like an hour taking bev home, then i finally got home and now i have to do fucking math homework. like a million and one problems. anyway, tomorrow's skate and surf, i'm pumped like woah. i better G-O-T in the words of errol. lol.  song of the moment: i hate everything about you ~three days grace

        there's been some major insanity over the past few days, and i loved every minute of it. well except getting caught. but that comes later. let's just start with tuesday.     &nbsp;   tuesday steph and i went to mandee. i got one of those terry cloth tube top things and white flip flops with sequins on them. then we decided we wanted to hang out with chaz and zach that night, so steph gave chaz a call. he was going to the mall with zach and jenny and invited us. we went to the mall, i got a few things, nothing too exciting except for the coach purse that matches my uniform. oh yeah, i got into r.c., congrats to me, i can't wait to get there. okay anyway. we went to the mall, then picked up chaz's friend nick. nick's a cool kid. anyway, we then dropped steph off so she could sneak out again later. we chilled at my house till she was ready. we went to the gates of hell. when we got there, there were other people who were too scared to go in, but we went anyway. we got pretty far, to the point where the tunnel splits into three other tunnels, and we went in the one all the way to the left. we got through it alright and everything, but then we got to this spot where it looked like it was concrete. it was like mad dirty water, WAIST DEEP. nick and i got totally soaked and wound up riding home with no pants on. it was pretty fun though. then we dropped jenny off at home and went back to chaz's and decided to crash there. except we didn't sleep. we took showers and then watched euro trip. then we decided to go for a walk, and then to dunkin donuts (in zach's car). then there was some insanity that i don't think i can get into online, it's illegal lol. then we visited matt felner at his house and nick goes the sun's gonna rise soon, so i get this genius idea to go to the beach and see it rise. it's like 4:45 in the morning at this point. we hop in the car, get down to point pleasant and watch the sun rise. then we went into the ocean which was insanely warm. we got home at like 8:30 and i just like crashed at home. that leads me to wednesday night.     &nbsp;   ahh, wednesday night was awesome. we went to christine's and me and jen crashed there. we talked about coach purses, went exploring, and chased the dominos guy down the block. lol. i'm not sure there's much else i can remember except i know it was insanely fun. which leads me to thursday.     &nbsp;   thursday me, stine, steph, zach, chaz, dan, nick and bobby went to six flags. we hit like every roller coaster except superman. it was uber hot. on chiller, my boob fell out of my bathing suit twice. it made dan giggle (he was sitting next to me lol). then we all just like went home for a little and got ready to go to chaz's. this is what got me in trouble. see, i told my mom i was staying at steph's for the night. more on that later. first chaz's house. so me chaz steph zach and stine went to get a movie at blockbuster which we never watched. then me and zach picked up dan and a cake from carvel (mr. morin: "why is there a cake in the freezer?"). we were like buggin out from lack of sleep. we tried to play monopoly (croutons? knockers? somalians? africa! slaves! lmao, strip monopoly? hahaha). then we were just like chillin. we were asleep by about 3, and i didn't wake up till like 11:30; everyone else got up earlier. then the trouble started. i got a call from my father and he was like where did you stay last night? and i was like steph's house, and he goes how come mrs. prats says you're not there? i'm like uhh.. maybe cause i'm at chaz's? i got beat for that, let me tell you, they told me i can't go out for the rest of the summer.. except tonight i went to stine's and out wandering lol. we'll see how far they take this. i won't be able to sleep out the rest of the summer, sure, but i'll be allowed out. so it's not terrible. sucks, but not terrible.     &nbsp;   now i'm just kinda chillin with my thoughts.. i think about things way too much, i've discovered that. but then when i don't think about things, like, when they're happening, i get in trouble, like, with myself. i don't know. things are mad weird. let's just see how the summer turns out.     &nbsp;   song of the moment:    this photograph is proof (i know you know) ~taking back sunday     &nbsp;   ``keep that in mind, the way that it felt    when  the most i could do was to just blame myself     (yeah, i'm playing that card)    when the most i could do was to just blame myself    and i know you know everything.    i know you didn't mean it.  i know you didn't mean it.      &nbsp;   so we're talking forever and you almost feel better,    but better's no excuse for  tonight .    you see, it's never been enough to just leave or give up,    but it's never good enough to feel right.     &nbsp;   now i'm lying on the table with  everything you did     it will all catch up eventually, well it caught up    and honestly, the  the weight of  my decisions  were impossible to hold     but they were never yours     they were never  yours ``        &nbsp;   and    i will play my game beneath the spin light ~brand new     &nbsp;    &nbsp;   ``the coastline is quiet while  we're quietly losing control     yes, we're silent but sure, we invented the cure that will     wash out my memories of  him .     the harpoon is loaded, the cage is lowered,    the water is  red     like   you  ``

        i can't believe this. it's insanity. you finally think you have everything sorted out, and it just turns out that you don't. remember the last journal entry? okay, add another guy to the mix and it gets even more confusing than it has ever been. it's just that when you have all sweet guys to like, it's hard to pick and choose who you want to be with, or try being with. i have each guy in mind in a&nbsp;certain&nbsp;way, and while every possible thing seems so great, you&nbsp;can't tell which will be&nbsp;a dead end, or a great relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;i can't talk about it anymore, it's too much to have to think about. on a lighter note, i'm going to r.c. next year. i'm souped for that. today i went shopping and spent over $200.... on underwear. it's sick. i think that's it. i have to be done writing before i spill my entire heart and head over the internet.     &nbsp;   song of the moment: &nbsp;   somebody told me ~the killers    ``ready? let's roll onto something new    taking its toll and i'm leaving without you    ready? let's roll onto something new     but heaven ain't close in a place like this     anything goes, but  don't blink, you might miss ``

        so.. it's weird typing in a journal online, and i just realized that. cause it isn't so much like a journal with all of your feelings (well okay for me it is sometimes cause i just put my feelings out for all the world to see usually) but more like a log of what you do. so okay, you're with this person, and you can think of so many reasons to hate them, but you know you love them like on a friends type level, and then it hits you-- they're insufferable sometimes, but that's when it could be a great relationship. so then you get all these other thoughts going through your head about what if you had a relationship and stuff. and it's all too much, especially when the guy you thought you liked is coming back from chopland on like friday and you have another really sweet guy who you are pretty sure likes you and you might be having feelings for but you're not sure. and then your head gets all scrambled up and you realize you're talking to your online journal, where just about the entire world can view what's going on in your head. even the guys in question. it's a very bizarre practice, this whole blog thing, isn't it? and has anyone else noticed that i'm feeling intensely deep tonight? and i'm practically asking questions to a silent audience. on another note, i've discovered that the blogger template i'm using allows me to change font size, name, and color. i'm excited. lol. okay i think it's too much thinking for tonight. my head hurts.     &nbsp;   song of the moment:    broken ~seether f. amy lee     &nbsp;   `` i wanted you to know, i love the way you laugh ,    i wanna hold you high and steal your pain away,    i keep your photograph and i know it serves me well    i wanna hold you high and steal your pain,    'cause i'm broken when i'm lonesome    and i don't feel right when you're gone away    you're gone away, you don't feel me anymore``

      there are so many emotions rushing through me right now. i just figured i should write it all down, cause i'm not sure when i'll feel this way about someone again. there are a million different songs for this person that i have in my head right now. i mean, have you ever wanted someone so badly that your body aches? especially when you tried to throw it all away and then realized how badly you screwed up? and now the kid is in portugual and i need to talk to him. it's insane. i can't believe this. i have feelings. and strong ones. i guess i just like him that much. now i hope i didn't fuck it all up cause then i'd be beat. and this just goes to show you-- if your friends tell you not to be with a guy from meeting him once and exchanging all of three words with him, they're not to judge. go with how you feel. i guess this is my kind of declaration to everyone, and most importantly to myself, how strongly i feel about him.  songs of the moment: lost in you ~sugarcult ``  six weeks went by  , still pretending that i'm fine and it was you and i  holding back what's on  my  minds  and all the things i should have said all the letters left unsent it was you and i but  mostly me ``  kiss from a rose ~seal i can't write lyrics for this.. it was the first song we danced to at prom.  the reason ~hoobastank ``i've found a reason for me to change who i used to be a reason to start over new and the reason is  you ``  love song ~311 `` whatever words i say  i will always love you``

      i hate people, like don't pat yourself on the back for giving up friends because that's what some people do. ok now that i've gotten that out of my system. saturday i went to the beach and got tannn and then went to the meadowlands fair with stine and my fam. can we say freeeeaaak showwww? it was insane, white trash like whoa. i got home and i was like can i please shower now? ughhh.. sunday was fourth of july, i didn't do anything except go out to dinner with the rents cause i didn't feel like going out-- i mean i know i should have been at fireworks or a party or something, but i just wasn't feeling it this year. now today's monday. i woke up this morning and brought stine a hot dog bun. now i'm just kinda chilling. hopefully something fun for tonight.  song of the moment: blurry ~puddle of mudd  ``nobody told me what you thoughy nobody tole me what to say  everyone showed you where to turn told you when to runaway  nobody told you where to hide nobody told you what to say everyone showed you where to turn showed you where to run away can you take it all away? can you take it all away?  well you shoved it in my face ``

      this quote describes me i guess.. whatever.. things have changed, people have changed, i've changed.. you just have to move on cause if not you get fucked in the ass (yes an expression lin lol).. i've learned a decent amount of things from all of this: 1. don't kiss your best friend's ex boyfriend. you will not be forgiven. 2. if you want to lose your virginity in a way that your friends don't agree with, don't tell them. 3. if you really truly don't want something found out, don't tell anyone, including your best friend. 4. this has nothing to do with the price of apples. meaning: you shouldn't change all the things you're used to being if they have nothing to do with the way your friend got screwed over. and just in general, don't change for anyone other than yourself. 5. it's hard to get your head around not being friends with someone anymore. 6. when your mother tells you that you're not compatible with friends, listen to her. 7. if people feel the need to check up on you all the time, they're not your friends **with the exception of having serious drug related problems, which i DO NOT have. 8. i want to say something really mean here but i feel bad for the person.  that's it. that's my list. i think that sums everything up. i'm drained now. time to go read or something.  song of the moment: the last frame ~a match like memory  ``best friends till  the end  but not by my watch..``

       its been awhile since i've posted, but nothing really has happened.. i've hung out with daniela a lot recently, which is really awesome, she gave me this amazing haircut and it just looks great.. last saturday stine's rents were out of town, so uhh let's rent a keg at 11:30 in the morning? lol.. boys + alcohol + empty house + renee = trouble lol, let's leave it at that. but that was a good day.. the parts i can remember clearly at least, lol. ohhh and i have pharyngitis.. yes, it came late this year, i thought i was done with that nonsense lol.. and they're still waiting to see if i have mono, so whatever. but anyway.. my doctor told me i had it, and i'm like omg is it contagious? and he goes yeah from "deep kissing" so i'm like.. that's chill then lol.. i think i've figured some things out, you know? except well i haven't totally, but i've narrowed some things down.. like kevin for instance.. i haven't realized it till now, but we've been talking/fighting since may, i think that says something.. even through the fights. i don't know. it's a weird feeling. but there's also someone else that's so.. new. and i want to say i don't know how i feel about any of this. but i think the biggest problem is that i know what i want to do, i just know it's not right, and very stereotypical summer of me. i guess only time will tell, right?      song of the moment:   little devotional ~taking back sunday (((warped tour today!!!!)))      ``do you think  she'd  be  better  at doing what   i do best  ?   i mean really, i know you're down for competition.   but  this could all be on purpose ...``
