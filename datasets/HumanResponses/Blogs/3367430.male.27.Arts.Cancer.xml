         The curtain is up on the recital. Thank you for coming!!! (like my top hat, white tie and tails?) Anyway maestro, this week I'll be writing about individuals whose presence changed the discourse of my life dramatically. I wrote about Dave McDonald this morning in the eternity blog.....I originally wanted to have nine individuals, one for each entrance for the House of Worship, but I have no clue how many there will be. Nine is actually (clear throat in a seemingly important manner here) A very Mystical number. The child is baking in the womb for nine months, Mythologically, nine is emblematic of the female goddess...the trinity cubed is nine. Actually, we've kind of started a new trend over the last forty-five minutes called "mystic blogging!!!".....long story, but can't you picture thickly bearded dervish dudes spinning around in there swivel chair for hours and then typing out a profound Blog adage?    Anyway, I'm taking a Blog bye-day tomorrow and mowing my mothers lawn. So the people I'm going to profile will begin Tuesday. Tonights recital is dedicated to Memorial Day. As many of you reading this can probably surmise, I don't think much about the current war and I can point to a certain part of my anatomy to convey what I think about our current president ("I have my hand on my heart but I don't know what for" as Brilliant folk-singer Greg Brown in his song I WANT MY COUNTRY BACK.) But I can point to the center of my chest in empathy when I think about our brothers and sisters who have died because our national presidential plutocrat sold a lie to the pesants he was suppose to protect (too many P's...).    Anyway, (this takes less time than it takes to read my crazy bloggs) take a look at this prayer and think about the continuity of the soul. Our nation has done a horrible job acknowledging confused Vietnam vets....I don't know how the Veteran's of this war will pan out, but I know that some of us are vehicles of peace.  Again, thanks for looking at this.    " O my God! O Thou forgiver of sins...    my God!  O Thou forgiver of sins, bestower of gifts, dispeller of afflictions!    Verily, I beseech thee to forgive the sins of such as have abandoned the physical garment and have ascended to the spiritual world.    O my Lord!  Purify them from trespasses, dispel their sorrows, and change their darkness into light.  Cause them to enter the garden of happiness, cleanse them with the most pure water, and grant them to behold Thy splendors on the loftiest mount. "  -Abdu'l' baha

      ...and naked I will blog, only I can already feel my own blogs growing stale and jaundice and gaining an insipid shelf-life though they are still so very addictive you could probably get a good street price for them...addicitive in almost a keyhole voyuristic-what-piece-of-attire-will-be-sloughed-next sort of way. Everything I've written so far looks like heaps of unwanted  bargain books at Barnes and Nobles. Writing is an odd profession. As novelist Richard Powers says in Galatea 2.2 the author (more or less states that), by diving into this odd literary lifestyle writers vex their families and inspire the lifes of total strangers. Boy do we ever. Mother and I are just finally getting along even though I can't give her a copy of my last published short story becasue it uses the F-word as a clumsy invective. I've probably spent sixty hours on that short story but if mom saw it she would consider it verbiage. My friend AJ--the creature who placed water-wings around my limbs and then (surprise) tossed me into this blog puddle is someone I really admire but would probably only squint at in forlorn nostalgia if we inadvertantly brushed shoulders while passing each other in the International wing of O'Hare. I can't even tell you what her voice sounds like, yet we've been playing post-it-comment ping-pong the last day-and-a-half and I feel that what she has to say is worth a great deal.     (+there's a few books burning inisde my friend AJ that I can't wait to read someday!!! When you see her visage painted inside a Bookstore mosaic, you can say that I called my shot even way back when!)     So here's my new BLOG context. The "Eternity" Blog could be called my shit, shower, shave Blog. It'll be a mirror about what I think is going on currently in my life and more importanly, the world. Say, for instance, how I think that Kobe Bryant should be castrated b/c young boys are going to emulate him and think it's ok to screw whatever you want b/c if your living large enough, you'll be able to get away with it or how I'd like to inform President Bush that Cancer, HIV and poverty are also Weapons of Mass Destruction and pain that have been found to reek mass havoc and are already imminent in the soil of our nation, planted like a landmines waiting to be pricked-off by unsuspecting limbs.      The "Eternity" blog will also shed the romantic perils of Swissy-Missy; what happens when you ingest copious amounts of caffeine into your immune system on a daily basis, stuff like that....    The eternity Blog is essentially the a.m. Blog. It's what I massage the keyboards with before I belly-flop into microsoft Word and listen to an annoying Paperclip assistant remind me once again that I mispelled a word by scraggiling a red line beneath my sentences.       The "Recital" BLOG is the one you should pay attention to becasue it's not about me solipsistically sulking. Yesterday I had so much fun BLOGGING that I gradually transitioned into the corpulent, overly-opinionated comic-book guy off the Simspons. What freedom writing (art, blogging, ect.) grants, but like any Dedalus I flapped my wings so hard at ny new found nickelodeon that I found myself with plenty of ink and parchment, but void of quills for which to write.               The more and more I slap the scattered alphabet on the keyboard in search of a good sentence or a solid image the more and more i feel that art and living is a somewhat reciprocated activity...that art sometimes frees us and takes us to places and that we get out what we put in. Put more simply, thank god for the stories we write and thank god for the stories of other people. In the movie FIELD OF DREAMS, Kevin Costner is denied access into the field he built--the crazy, picaresque, visionary baseball field he erected in the middle of a cornfield--much to his neighbors dismay--while monopolizing all his savings in the process. The see-through baseball suited wraith grants James Earl JOnes access and when Kevin Costner throws a hissy-fit, the wraith just sort of looks at him minty-eyed austerely and modestly inquires, "You did all this for you?"        The "Recital" p.m. Blog will often have a thing and be directed toward other people. Starting tomorrow the Recital theme will be people (mystical, literary protagonist sort-of-individuals) I've met and loved who've had a profound influence on my life. I've whittled it down to 9--one for every entrance to the house of worship. This is a great writing excercise becasue it makes you thankful and you can reminisce at the same time. Tomorrow's recital will feature the the folk trobadour--a person who gives music, who's playing tonight at Sullivan's 10-2, so for all you townies....    gotta go know. Blog blog blog blog blog blog blog. I'm gonna go home, feng-shui and play a THE SOUND OF SILENCE on my Melodica........"Hello Darkness my old friend........."

        Solid writing day. Not a ten pager but two and half single space isn't bad considering that the library closes early. Patiencearya should have mentioned that these blogs are addictive (they should have been called Starbucks). All day I had a vision of a derby capped slim shirted individual cornering me in an alleyway bribing me with an illicit Blog, holding a little ziplock bag in front of me, chanting "Come, you know you want it. You know you need." And all day I wrote on the novel, planted corn row sentences on the page, put up with yuppie rich kids at work....geez, now I feel like Anne Frank. Maybe I'll call my diary entry Kitty and go home and see if my apartment has an attic and scribble about how people are really good at heart, which of course, we really are, even with all the shit that's happening in the world, floods in the Carribean, bodies in Iraq, social apathy here on the home front, you gotta believe that there is a universal oneness and that we are (somehow) a part of it and each individual needs to somehow strive and find out what there role is...what they can do...who they are as a human being verses a marketable material commodity. It's our duty, our dharma, and God (which writer was it, Rick Moody?? Dave Wallace???) who talked about hating enough to love enough to try to chancge the world enough. I think it was Dave wallace in "Girl w. Curious Hair" but don't quote me....      It's the end of May which means that its been almost eight years since I exited the salmon-flavored hallways of Manual High school, located in the south side of Peoria, an academic stye, school of demons that still need to be extinguished, highest teenage pregnancy rate in the Nation (three girls in the top ten of '96 had kids...seriously, they had a Bring you Kid to School my senior year...when I was wearing berets and listening to the Cure and writing quote "deep" horrible poetry pretending to be Kerouac...I think my first great so--called deep hit was, "In a world so sad, so inane, to put it's trust in Kurt Cobain" Oh well, even Shakespeare had to go out and pluck his muse in order to get a quill....       I spent the week before graduation hospitalized. I wore the flowery hospital smock and received a sponge bath from an old Black lady named Bertha who would leave the room while I attened to my "Mens Parts" as she labeled them as if they were located in the back of a shed or inside a tackel box, at Lowes on sale.    I was pretty messed up in high school and did alotta things to glean attention (in addition to having the Highest teenage pregnancy rate in the nation, my high school also boasted the loweset I-sat scores in the state. Ironically they one the state basketball championship three-out-of-the four years I attended and a big scam was evinced after I left becasue several of the district administrators confessed that grades were in fact manipulated for athletes)...I was an anal valium plug my senior year strung out on antidepressants when all I really needed (all most people really just need) is an occasionally F&&&&ing aye. An occasion yeah, life's shit, but we're here and we're resilient. There's always been and always will be people who seemed to hurt you but there's a glory that comes just through living. From having gone through something and come out and find yourself planted in fornt of an twelve-inch pixillation jotting down your memoirs....        I was in the hospital and they never found out what spawned the pancreatic flareup. I'm almost certain that it was spawned from tossing around my 'ample' girlfriend at prom, beautiful Kristina Rock from East Peoria. (I'd always pantomine that her name was CHRIS ROCK, and her face would tinge to the color of cheap wine coolers and she'd give me the finger)...anyway, becasue I was trying to see what artery did what with a potato peeler my senior year, my GPA sunk like an anchor in the Atlantic and I found myself donning the cap and gown and being surrounded by similar donned cap and gowned individuals that I didn't know--almost like I was in a mock foliage. Kristina came from across town and had her golden hair pinned up and her fair movie screen forehead just sort of looked at my class in awe as we stomped past in mock pomp and circumstance. After the ceremony the superintendant who knocked up a student teacher in lieu of a wife gave me a hug and complement and insisted that he pose for a picture with me. I remember being shouldered in the procession and seeing Mr. Washer (God Bless his soul!) telling me to have a wonderful life. I remember my father (God bless his soul!) giving me a hug...God love him!!!!!     And after the graduation we got drunk. We went home and I uncorked a bottle of wine from the Rhine valley in Germany. White Trash Pat had already been drinking for something like forty-hours, oblivious that his brother Allan was kickin' it with Amber Steele (Like her heart)....and Jackie was there and Nicke was there and Crazy Strickler wore sunglasses and a beret and started calling everyone 'Vinny' and I had a hard time opening up the wine so we eventually toated chalices to the future with little shards of cork bobbing like little corky buoys in the middle of our libations. Saying salut-tay. Chin-chin!!! and in the neck year both Jackie and Nickie would have kids and Strickler would be doing more shrooms than a Mario brother and Kristina would leave me becasue I behaved like Ted Hughes, behaved like how I though male poets were supposed to behave, so she left me and after my last college final first semester freshman year, I felt a pause and wished I could pick her up and we could bery-berry cobbler and swig cheap-coffee at Steak and Shake and just chill.......    But now, years later after graduation, I still toeast an empty chalice that is fraught with the future. For each of us. Drink up...each of us have our own cup that is full of something sweet, of is it sweet.  Chin-chin.....  (sorry fraught with errors, library is closing

      ....to be unimportant, Thank you father Wittgenstein (Vick-tin-stein, Lick-tin-stein, beerstein). Growing up I was a major comic book/sci-fi swigging geek (I wore thick brown glasses that looked like old abandoned RCA television sets you'd find furbished at a retirement home somewhere, more than likely blaring Lawrence Welk reruns; you know...teal and flamingo colored suits, bad polka, ubiquitous bubbles?) and everynight during junior high I would progarm my own less dated television set to automatically snap off at 11:30 so I could sway my nocturnal thoughts against stellar intergalactic lull of the starship enterprise. Remember that lull? That static white noise that warbled in the background as beautiful spandex clad female vulcans would say "Captain" and press the silver-dash nipple orb and speak scientifically into it? "Hello Beverly Cursher--YOW!!!"    Anyway, since I vowed last week to blog before writing everyday and then, thinking about my mom's furrowed brow, looking into her shoes as she tells me at a family function involving cranberries and stuffing and superficially polite relative conversation that her son has monopolized his life obtusely bent over a smith-corona writing sentences that she herself would personally be embarrassed to have her Church friends peruse (and then pray for)....I backed off, which was a mistake. I've never journaled, or logged, blathered or blogged but I write long, tortuous novels and love writing more than I could possibly convey here. Every joy I've gleaned in the last four years has come from streaming down sentences...long, bulky, meaty fraught language that slowly dots its way across the contours of the white page; Paragraphs that look like little aerial shots of neighborhoods snapped from above...yes, writing is a joy and its a helluva life (the rejections, the amours, the occasional shot, the hubris, the academic pretense, the pedantic mien I used to wear like zippers on a 1980's Footloose jacket I now loathe....all this stuff)....    I came to one conclusion after reading my "gypsy" friends blog. Whereas Focoult (I think it was him, either him or Blanchot)said that 'He who knows not how to hide,know not how to love', I'd have to retort and say that the joy of living an aesthetic lifestyle; a life in the arts, is always one of opening yourself up--making yourself a little vulnerable. So here I am...maybe this personal-confession will carry over into my fictious renderings, but more so, the emphasis is always on the reader him/herself....As Joseph campbell would carp "have you been reborn? Have you died to the infantile creature you were and given birth to the mature?  So here goes, rather than rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic, I promise to be (almost) one-hundred percent completely honest with my daily rants (the margin of error, stemming from that I write fiction and love to entertain, so if I devise some crazy story involving a unicycle and a yak and pawn it off as fact, its simply for your amusement as well as mine...  I think I inadvetantly started two simultaneous blogs at once. This should be fun.  Time to motor (I need more caffeine) and the Wittgenstein quote ends but the possibility of every single thing show us something about the nature of the world...

      Here's what MPR says about Franz Kafka:  "The first love of his life was a woman named Felice Bauer. After he met her, he spent ten days writing her a letter to re-introduce himself, and then sent her a letter almost every day for the next five years."  She blogs me, she blogs me not.....

      My first sojourn to the Baha'i House of Worship in Wilmette transpired one day before Naw Ruz on Thursday, March 20th, 2003. My grandmother had died earlier in the week and the Wednesday night I rolled my dilapidated but acclimated wagon into downtown Chicago I was greeted with the news that US forces had begun to slam Baghdad with a batch of missiles. Mother was taking care of her stepfather Frank; keeping the house clean, making sandwhiches, penning out a premature list of peace lily Thank Yous. The remainder of the family was gathered around the digital rectangle in the living room, watching swirled armageddon boutonnieres achingly pin their way across the Iraqi dawn.   When I greeted my relatives with whiffed condolensces and embraces they briefly knodded and swatted me out of their vision. Artillery tinsel exploded across the glazed lens. My Uncle Rudy kept making unfounded correlations to 9-11, talking about patriotism using playoff terminology.  "That's what happens when you mess with us on our home court." He says. "Watch-out!!That's what I'm saying. BAM! Look at the size of that explosion!!! Baghdad's gonna be a parking lot for US hummers!!! That's all I'm saying!!"  I feel like pointing out that I don't think Iraq had much to do with the terrorist attacks on 9-11 but don't. Instead I slurp instant coffee under the hard yellow lights of Grandma's circa 1970's kitchen. I come from a family of mostly republicans. Sometimes my long hair doesn't auger well in regards to political conversations. My Uncle Rudy has already told me once to get a haircut, hippie.  "What do you think about the war?" I ask mom.  "I hope you're not drafted." She says.  "No, I mean seriously. We're literally pillaging a country with corpses for what...oil?"  "They have Weapons of Mass Destruction." My hushed-eyed mother says with discernment. "The paper says that they found Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq. Don't you think that's a valid reason to attack?"  I don't but my lips remain sterile. Mom's lived through the Vietnam war and the cuban missile crisis. Her real father was an hard-edged alchololic who was so blitzed he didn't even make it to his daughters wedding. In the last thirteen months mom witnessed the demise of both her husband and her own mom. She has hard diminutive cocoon-shaped shadows pooled beneath her eyelashes.  I haven't seen mom since Christmas when she yelled at me for going outside for a cigarette.  "Things in the world are pretty crazy right now." Mom says. "At least your father and grandma are with the Lord."  "Yeah," I say, assenting chin to her solace, sipping tepid grains of coffee.  "Our countries at war!" Uncle Rudy declares as he runs into the kitchen, opening up the fridge, frisking his fingers on the lower shelf for a beer.         *    The next morning avenue thick headlines furrow the brows of early editions nation wide and I take my leave. I ignore my yahoo driving directions to 100 Linden Ave, Wilmette IL. and instead drive parellel north accompanying Lake Michigan knowing that I need to take a hard right sometime after I guzzle through Northwestern's campus. It is March and the budding spring sky is grisly soil, bulbous clouds cut like triangular-sails hang heavily above. My grandmother's visitation is at four pm. Illinois plays Western Kentucky this afternoon in the first round of NCAA tournament. After what seems like months of speculation and political absurdity regarding a purported nest of vile weapondry, my birth country has tranisitioned into a gradeschool bully, hoisting lunchroom wedgies into the waist-lines of the meek.   I flick on the radio. NPR seems to have round-the-clock coverage of Baghdad's bombing. The few ground atrillery men stationed on Iraqi soil have already coined the euphemism 'friendly fire' in regards to US casualties. The entire war seems to be marketed to a gullible-lobed populace simply as AMERICA at WAR. No one seems to want the war and in a way, no one seems to care.   I continue to drive north. My windsheild has been dotted with flecks rain. It is almost like the whole world's starting to sniff and realize that their mascara is begining to run and they don't want anyone to see what they really think or feel. I know I need to take a right somewhere only I'm not exactly sure where.  *         "When you go to the House of Worship make sure you have them show you the cornerstone room." Uncle Mike informs me. We are going on one of our idle drives where I ask him questions and he delivers anecdotes. I am inbetween shifts. I teach during the day, try to crank out pages during the afternoon, fuel myself with Starbucks House blend and Camel filters and then coast through my library post at night, clocking off at 3 am, motoring home, showering, seep up the cat vomit, sleep by four, up and at 'em by seven-fifteen. Day starts all over again. The days and the weeks blur into vertigo bouquet--which is fine. A moment to muse and mull over my life means that I have to eye certain facts. Means that I have to admit that I'm twenty-five and don't have a fucking clue what's happening to my life. Means not having to ascertain the reality that my father's skull is gradually eroding in his Sunday best beneath a diminutive heap of dirt, that my mom wants nothing to do with me, that my sisters and I don't talk. Working all the time means that I don't have to be at the house I'm renting where my roommates kids and cats take turns sullying the carpet and subtle unemployed acquaintences squat on our sofa for days on end plugged into playstation. Working all the time means that I'll have cash for gas and cigarettes and booze on the weekends. That I'll be able pay off the exorbitant rash my college loans and credit cards have become. Working all the time means that eventually I won't care what happens to myself or to anyone. Means that'll have to watch my own ass, screw other people over, eventually get to a financial echelon where my back account is full and my chest is completely empty.    Occasionally I take the afternoon off from writing and have dinner with Uncle Mike. The crazy Baha'i psychic who used to live down the street from me who used to give readings to Gretta Alexander, famous psychic from Delevan.  "Gretta was all ego," Mike huffs.   "She was on the news last week," I tell him, how, in passing, I saw her ample frame featured on a national televsion show late at night.  "She said that everyone has a little bit of these powers in them. 'Everyone can play chopsticks--I can play chopin' That was her words verbatim."  "Gretta was all ego," Mike says. "She didn't understand her gifts. People who are born with these gifts sometimes develop tremendous egos."  "The television program said that she was struck with lighting when she was eight and that was how her powers came into fruition."  Uncle Mike has always told me that his own gifts were really no big deal and that most of the time they are more of a curse than a blessing. He says to think of presupposed supernatural gifts as antenaes. "Think of human beings as antenaes." He points to the silver stem sprouting up from near the top of his hood. "Right now, passing through that antenaes--passing through our own bodies, there are millions of  frequecies-but only certain frequencies can be only determined when the antenae is tuned specifically to a certain dial. There are even televsion and satellite frequencies, but certain antenaes can only pick up certain frequencies. You get what I'm saying? He inquires.     "What frequency do you think you're tuned into." He suggests.  "My own," I retaliate, tired, dreading going into work later on in the evening.  *      I roll my station wagon into the parking lot at 100 Linden Avenue. Thick green tufts of spring branches grants birth to an immaculate papal-hatted dome levitating above the chipped-blue suburban skyline. I smell like cigarettes and Starbucks. I can feel the huffed-breeze of Lake Michigan zip the back of my neck. I flick off talk radio. Baghdad is preparing for another nocturnal fussilade. There is construction humming outside near the gardens. The thick mop of clouds has momentarily parted and a slender slant of sunlight has managed to wedge its way through. I have arrived, exhausted, emotionally-enervated, but I have arrived nonetheless.  *  "When Abdu'l-baha arrived at the dedication ceremony for the House of worship in Wilmette the contractors already had the corenerstone picked out for him." Mike said. I'm exhausted. Another late-night shift is slowly shedding its blue-collar antics on the denim horizon of dusk.  "Yeah," I say, emitting a soporific yawn. I tell Mike that I have to be at work earlier, around 9:30. I tell him that I need to put in extra-time so that I can go to my grandma's Wake later in the week. I've also told him that I'm going to the house of worship. Can show him the internet directions I've downloaded.  "The house of Worship is a holy place." Mike mentioned earlier. He told me about the time when he was in his late twenties and he bumped into a seeker in a Chinese restaurant the two of them went for a drive and Uncle Mike told him stories about the faith. He told this seeker all about the early pilgrims. All about Hafai. All about the Bab and the dispensation. Uncle Mike and the seeker drove from Bloomington to Peoria and from Peroia to Wilmette.   "We just felt drawn their like a magnet." Mike said. "I met this man around 8 in the evening and by the time we arrived at the House Of Worship it was 4:30 in the morning. We got to watch the sunrise over Lake Michigan together before we attended devotions. Later on in the day, this man accepted the faith."  I picture Mike thirty years ago, tall and lanky but still somewhat awkwardly jointed, his bird-squinting face still bearing thick spectacles. I picture the two of them with sloppy school boy haircuts sitting on the steps to the House of Worship, watching the nuclear hearth slolwy push its way over the saltine shores of Lake Michigan.    Mike keeps driving. He has been spoon-feeding my spiritual zeal anecdotes about the house of worship. He is telling me about the cornerstone room about how when the Master arrived the contractors had reserves a special cement groom for Abdu-l'baha to consecrate and Abdu'l-Baha told them simply to wait.  "He told them to wait?" I inquire. Mike nods.  "They were ready to have the ground breaking ceremony and Abdul-baha told them simply to wait."  "So they waited."  "Yes," Mike says, with a nod. "They waited and Abdu'l-Baha pointed. In his direction their was an old lady ferrying a rock in a little red wagon. Abdul-baha pointed at it and said, 'Will use this one.'"   "Wow."  "This was in accordance to biblical scripture: 'He shall use the stone the builders rejected.'" I pause-engrossed. It is a fascinating story.  "I need to get to work." I tell Mike.  "Are you going to be alright at your grandmothers funeral?" Mike asks.  "Yeah," I tell him. "She was old. She had a good life. Once you hit eighty you can't ask for much more. Eighty-laps around the old sun is pretty good. Dad only had fifty-four."  "Say the prayer for the departed for her." Mike tells me.  "I will." I say. I say the Prayer for the Departed everynight. Mike pulls up in front of the library. I open the car door.  "Here," Mike says, groping my fist. He grabs my hand and plants a wadded twenty in it.  "Mike I'm fine."  "You're going to need money for gas." He says.   "Thanks." I look at him, ashamed that he thinks I'm having financial trouble.  "Well, take care buddy." I go to shut the burgundy wing of Mike's Lincoln Continental.  "Just remember," Mike says.  "What," I reply, curiously.  "When you see your grandmother's body, all that is is a rug. Your're not seeing her true essence."  "Thanks," I say, pausing. Mike drives off. I go in front of the library and fire up a coveted cigartte before my shift. Tomorrow I am going up to Chiacgo to pay my respects to my grandmother. I am going to the House of Worship. Other than that I really have no clue where I am going. Not a clue at all.                              * * *        (sorry-this is a two-party. Check back Monday for the remainder. As always, thanks for putting up with my long entries. You girls rule!!!)

      Just got back from my first ever fireside---never been to one before, if you can believe that----it was intriguing, myself and four 'older'  ladies who look like they could have just come back from the national bridge and crocheting marathon had a long and detailed Baha'i oriented discourse about the soul. It was beautiful in a way. Being a former very uptight Christian lad --(up 'til freshman year in Highschool I used to carry a 3x5 inch Gideon bible in my back pocket to quell my innate animalistic urges such as lust.....nuh-uh, no Junior Varsity cheerleaders for this sinner) I perceived things in polarities growing up. Most Christians do. There was judgement. There was Heaven and Hell. There was sinner and Saint. There was good and evil.  There was nausea ridden guilt that made you feel spiritually sullied if you had a wet dream or heard the word 'shit' used in casual conversation. Most Christians don't believe in the perpetual continuity of the soul. They don't believe in praying for those who have sloughed their earthly garments and entered the spiritual realm.  They don't believe that the soul can advance with our assistance and prayers in this realm. When the soul raises its hands and capitulates to the vagaries of the physical attire, either the soul enters the Golden gates of  Heaven (or golden arches of McDonalds depending on your level of cholesterol) or the tarnished soul flickers in the fire of damnation. These two concepts are very valid and propel the success and promulgation of 'contemporary' Christianity today.   One of the first things Uncle Mike ever taught me about the Baha'i faith was that the worlds, the spiritual world and the physical world coalesce. They exist simultaneously. "Just like the embryo isn't aware that its forming limbs to be used in this world--neither are we aware that we are forming certain virtues to be exerted in the next."  Last week Uncle Mike told me that and I cut him off.  "But think about genetic engineering. We can now orchestrate and influence DNA henceforth altering the child in the womb."  "Yes," Mike said. "And what makes you think the next world isn't assisting us right here? What makes you think that they're not helping us right now?"  Even in these crazy blogs. Mathematically, the chances that any of us ' blogging buddies' ever would have met, are slim to nil. Yet, somehow, we're kicking and screaming, kicking it gangsta style inisde the utero of our corporeal existence....some of us are even dreaming and flying as well.   *  Outside of Uncle Mike, Mara-Arya,  Marjean, Cool Abir from Minnesota and a few others, the person almost solely responsible for introducing me to the Baha'i faith is Joseph Campbell.  He's never to my knowledge said the word 'Baha'i' but arguably no scholar has done more to buckle the sociological gaps between religions in the last 100 years than Mr. Campbell has himself. (maybe a dispensation or two, but that's beside the point).   Joseph Campbell was once presenting a lecture to prep school children about Buddha and Christ-like conciousness that is inside all of us. He was trying to glean something the young men would understand. His vision momentarily hovered up into the ceiling for an analogy and he found one.  "Look up, boys." Joseph Campbell said, assenting his chin to the north. The curious faces of his students followed.  "If you look up you could say that the light, singular is on, or you could say that the LIGHTS plural are on and its two ways of saying the exact same thing.  "What is important." Campbell verbally accentuates. "Is not the vehicle (such as the fiber and the glass that constitute the bulb) but the light. And when the light break the superintendent of buildings and grounds doesn't lament and say that, 'That was my particular favorite bulb'...he takes it out, plugs another one back in."  The light is what's important. There are jesus bulbs and Buddha bulbs and Krishna bulbs, but what's important is not the particluar bulb that flickers and then gradually fizzes but the overall LIGHT.  In japan this is called (phonetically since the book is in storage) the chi-ho-ki (the individual realm) and the ri-ho-ki (the general realm) and then maxim goes gee-ree-mee-gay (Individual/general no obstruction)....likewise, using the categories of logic we can deduce; Baha'i/Christian  Yin/Yang Black/White male/female (Beer/Wine..well, maybe not)... same thing...you get what I'm saying. Looks like the earth really is one country and mankind is its sole citzens after all. Coleman Barks (who is almost solely responsible for anthologizing the Western world with english translations of Rumi) notes that, "The fact that we are multiple is not so great as the fact that we are one."  Campbell notes that this realization is the ultimate mystical experience that a human being can harbor here on this planet because the individual psyche has vaulted over the realm of polarities into the realm one plurality...into the realm of oneness with all things.

      Lots of crazy stuff going on. Been writing all day. Here's the poem I have in my head right now. It's by ee cummings, the third and fourth stanzas just destroys me..........   somewhere i have never traveled,gladly beyond any experience,your eyes have their silence: in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me, or which i cannot touch because they are too near   your slightest look easily will unclose me though i have closed myself as fingers, you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens (touching skillfully,mysteriously)her first rose   or if your wish be to close me,i and my life will shut very beautifully,suddenly, as when the heart of this flower imagines the snow carefully everywhere descending;   nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals the power of your intense fragility:whose texture compels me with this colour of its countries, rendering death and forever with each breathing   (i do not know what it is about you that closes and opens;only something in me understands the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses)  nobody,not even the rain,has such small hands

      Cute Jenny from down the hall said it was really no big deal about the VICTORIA SECRET catalogue when I knocked on her door and handed her the scrolled slice of silk photographic heaven. She then said that if I wanted to borrow anymore feel free to stop by anytime. She said she even thought that she had some old catalogues lounging around her apartment somewhere. She said that she understands that sort of thing.  *   ".....?"   *  Uncle Mike roused me up early Saturday morning. Said we were going to say prayers.  "Mike it's 7:30," I said, my matress fraught with books, my eyelids and equilibrium still both endowed with flecks of nocturnal crust.  "Time to go." He said. Up and at 'em. Before I have time to shit, shower and shave I find myself looking at my soporific morning reflection through the bluish windshield of Uncle Mike's Lincoln Continnental as his cement foot plummets the gas pedal and we speed down the underbelly of the Interstate. It is early and both of us are somewhat pensive. If I don't get an earnest shot of something disel-thick and heavily caffeinated poured down my throat in the next fifteen minutes there's no telling what dire ramifications may ensue. Mike floats his foot off the gas and swerves the vehicle and the next thing I know we are on a two lane country road, following a sign that reads POW WOW.  "We going to the Pow Wow?" I say, somewhat befogged.   "We're going to say prayers." Mike says, flopping a program in my direction.  "Do they know that we're coming here to say prayers?" I inquire.  "They will," he says again. "Sometimes opportunities present themselves to you and all you have to do is wedge in your elbow to make something happen." Mike says, handing me a batch of UNITY prayers he had embellished on fine paper at Kinko's. "When you get up there make sure you pass these out."  "What..." I say. Mike always does this shit. Should've figured. I take my hair out of my morning pony-tail and crassly pretend I'm Hawkeye from Last of the Mohicans. As long as I go into the POW WOW I might as well pretend that I'm a warrior.  "People will listen to what you have to say here." Mike says. "People will listen."   *  Cute Jenny just stopped by and dropped off a stacked heap of old VICTORA SECRET catalogues. Do I offer her coffee. Yes. Do I think she's a freak. YES. Turns out she has a kid who's eleven. She saw me running around with a bunch of kids last week and thinks that I'd be perfect with her son. Do I run out of the room screaming? No. Do I offer her my phone digits? No. Do I make the mistake of saying it's been a pleasure and nod my head when she suggests we hang out again sometime in the near future. Unfortunately.  This happened last week. I got seriously cornered by Psycho-Michelle. I went on ONE date with Psycho-Michelle three years ago and I'm scared shitless every time I bump into her. She won't shut up and she still talks about how much we have in common. Common my ass--I can't even recall her last name. I got pissed off because when she was at my apartment three years ago she pee'd with the freakin' bathroom door open. AHHHHHH!!!!  Psycho-Michelle did an avant-garde art video of a sunrise and a silo which she thinks is quote "deep" and everyone else thinks is quote "crap". I'm good friends with Michelle's ex-husband who oddly enough gave me "permission" to date her.  "Dude, she's crazy but go for it."  "What?" I say. Looking at Tom, Psycho-Michelle's ex.  "No man, I'm like totally over her. She was a good time. Not that I woudln't do it again, but I'm totally over her." Tom used to smoke alotta weed.   "Alright." I say. Sure. Check it. Before this the last time I saw Michelle she parked her car on the curve and flagged me down. Told me all about her new job as an art educator. Told her how much her own kid loved me.  Michelle and Tom's son is named Chloe. Chloe's a girls name but for some reason that's what they wanted to name him, only it's pronounced as one rushed syllable--CLOW, like blow.  After our one date (when went 'swing' dancing and she threw-up in the backseat of my old chevette) Michelle started inviting me over because apparently Chloe wanted to see me. Chloe's cool. He's into Calvin and Hobbes and likes Narnia and Middle-earth. He used to collect Transformers and I gave him alotta of my 'old' Transformers from the mid-80's. I actually prefer Chloe to his mother. Michelle went through this phase where she would quote mantra's from Hindu sages about veganism.  "Live long and prosper!" Chloe and I would say, appropriately splitting our hands into a Mr. Spock shaped V as Michelle dished us Tofu.  "That's Vegan, not Vulcan." Michelle would say with a scowl. I got banned from Michelle's house after I took Chloe to White Castle. They don't call em sliders for nothing and Chloe and I bought like forty of 'em one afternoon and made up a flatulant slider song which Michelle later classified as being quote 'scatalogical'.   Oh well, nothing beats corrupting the son to piss off the mother. To Psycho-Michelle's credit, she knows alot about contemporary art. My favorite coceptual piece at the Art Institute of Chicago is really just a large pool of candy. It's by this Latino artist who died of AIDS. The candy heap is exactly 88 pounds--the weight of the artist's lover before he died. Patrons are encouraged to take a piece of candy and the heap is sporadically refurbished so that at the begining of every week it weighs exactly 88 pounds and then dwindles. One afternoon, three autumns ago, I couldn't stop staring at the candy waterfall. It was like I had some connection to it. Watching the patrons bend over and unwrap the penny candy and bite into it, it felt for a moment that everything would be alright. Even after death, everything is somehow refilled and appreciated.  Psycho-Michelle knew this piece well. She almost knew too much about it. When I told her the piece in passing she pronounced the artist's full name, rolling her r's and then gave me a book report. It was kinda weird.   *  Mike parks his Lincoln in front of the Pioneer trail. I tell him that he can't park here. I tell him that his car will be towed. He's a psychic, he's suppose to be able to adumbrate certain events.            "The car will be fine," He says. "Go over to the meal tent and find some coffee then come over to the bonfire."  I stumble out of the car. The pow wow is almost like a renaissance festival. People are dressed up in different garments. There are Native American's dressed up in beautiful brown leather; their ceremonial headress a fireball shock of multi-feathered plumes. There are people dressed like Geroge Washington and Johnny Tremain. A boy and a girl even walk around looking like they just went to see Pirates of the Carribean after eating at Long John Silvers. Everyone seems totally comfortable being someone else.    "I feel like I should have worn my cowboy hat and learned how to spit." I tell Mike later in the day, referring to the multi-culturalism of the event.  "Shame on you." He says. Every time I say something with a twist of mordant humor added in for flavor. Mike is always shaming me with a smirk on his face. He always says the same thing after he shames me.  "Things are gonna happen to you." He always says with a slight smile creviced beneath his lips.   I shuffle the Unity prayer cards. I drown a shot of cheap coffee that tastes like filtery grains . I find Mike and we walk up to the tent together. An old Native American is burning sage-brush that smells like something you'd pass around at a homecoming bonfire and say, 'ear' after inhaling deeply.    The pastor is female, Native American. She has long braided hair and wears scholarly glasses. Mike is wobbling back and forth, holding one of his arms crooked.  "Why Hello." He says to the pastor. The pastor greets him very amicably. She is holding an acoustic guitar like a rifle.  "We were wondering if we could say a Baha'i Unity prayer during the service." Mike says. "This is David. He's a Bradley student. He's also a very good reader."  The pastor face hushes and then she smiles. She says that she herself would be honored. I of course, don't want to pray in front of a bunch of trick-or-treaters. Mike always does this. Always hands me the reins of the stage-coach just before the horses halt in front of the abyss.  The pastor begins to sing songs that my mother sings on Sunday morning. Contemporary folk Christian songs. We are seated in a Unity circle. The pastor strikes the same three acoustic chords over and over and the circle sings about God being an awesome God. She then stops and sounds very reminsicent of Chief Seattle as she says that we know that, whatever denomination we stem from, there is only one God and that he is awesome. She closes her eyes and contorts her hands up in prayer.  "I'd now like to invite David, a member of the Baha'i community to say a welcoming prayer." She says.  *  Cute Jenny just left. Two hours after she handed me the wad of VICTORIA SECRET catalogues, she stopped by with a cherry pie. Said she just felt like doing some baking. It was no big deal. Thought I looked like I could use some pie.  "Thank you." I say, holding the pie in front of me like a two month old.  "You can set the pie down." She says.  "Oh," I say. The heap of Victoria secret sluts are visible in the kitchen trash can. If she comes in she'll see it and feel that I didn't honor her first gift.  "Watcha up to?" She inquires. I wish she would leave. I want to watch SPORTSCENTER. I want to finsih my blog. I wish cute Jenny was Swissy-Missy. I wish she was someone else. Uncle Mike will be home shortly.  "Just writing." I say.   "Is that what you do?" She asks.  "Yeah. I love it. I love every second of it. It doesn't pay the bills. Doesn't pay at all really. But you never know...."  "I like Anne Rice." She says. "Anne Rice is really deep. Do you like Anne Rice?"  "Uh-yeah," I slur. I hate Anne Rice. Tried reading Vampire Lestat once and couldn't get through it. I feel like saying something witty. Something that Uncle Mike would say "Shame on you," if I said it in public. Something like, 'Yeah, I like Anne Rice, just what is she doing screwing Uncle Ben?"        "Are you busy?" Cute Jenny asks, she is slithering in my apartment. I feel like screaming, "FREAK!!!!" I feel like running. I want to leave.  Instead I smile.  "My roomy's coming back soon." I say.  "The old guy?" She retorts.  "Yeah," I say. "His name is Uncle Mike. Although he's not really my Uncle he's just my friend."  "How do you know him?" She inquires. Her eyes bat. Her hair is cinnamon-colored and short. She has a full-breath smile that looks like her face could change color any second.  "He kinda took me in once," I say. "Once when I was all alone...."  She looks at me. I can tell she's feeling lonely as well.  "Thanks for the pie. That was sweet of you." I say. I set the pie on the carpet. I give her an embrace. I can feel her fingernails press into my back. The hug lasts three seconds longer than it should for people who socialize solely on a first name basis. My eyes are open and I can feel that hers are conciously closed.  "You wanna come over later for a beer?" Cute Jenny requests.  "I'm kinda busy. We're in the process of moving."  "Oh," She says. "You and the old guy."  "Yeah," I reply. "Me and the old guy."   *  I look up midway through the recital of the Unity prayer and can see that the circled worshippers are all praying. No one's looking at me funny. The colonial garbbed people are praying. The Native americans are praying. The two pirates are praying. Even the family that looks like they are on vacation and made it a point to attend worhip are praying. Everyone is praying. I hate praying in public. Hate sounding like I am an authority of the faith I really just discovered myself. Hate sounding like I am an outlet plugged into the divine glory when actually I myself have never stopped seeking. Never stopped questioning. Never stopped loving.  "Thank you." The female pastor says, with a smile. Mike gives me a stolid nod like I just caught a pop fly in far left-center. I return to my seat. I brush my hair back. I look into my shoes and pretend to be mystical and deep. The pastor is pensive. She clears her throat.  "That was beautiful." The pastor says. She then says something amazing,  "I was brought up in a family that was half-Baha'i and half-christian." The pastor says. Everytime I hear somebody say the word "Baha'i" who I have never seen before it just claws at me inside. It a very beautiful dual-syllable word. My best friend David, said the word once in a cafe and it was just....it sounded like plosive feather resonating from the lips of a crystal cherub.    "Even though I teach Christianity, I've learned form the Baha'is that there is only  one creator and that all of us here, through worship honor him."  She thanks me again for reading it. She sounds kind of choked up. I feel guilty for not saying more. Maybe I feel guilty for not being more.  Before the pastor chimes into the next hymn there is an announcement over the PA. Someone has parked their car in an illegal zone, in front of the pioneer trail. It's a maroon colored Lincoln Continental, license plate.....  Mike fishes his keys out of his pocket. He hands them to me.  I move the car and apologize to the officer who asks me if I can read. I head back to the tent to get a cup of coffee. I'm still dazed. I want to sleep. I almost want to hug the pastor.  As I head back to the Unity Circle I see Uncle Mike wobbling in his akward keyhole shaped gait towards me.  "Where are you headed? I just moved the car."  "We have to go," He says, walking ahead of me.  "What?" I say. "It's rude. She said something very nice about us and now we're leaving."  "David," he says. "We have to get ready for the dinner this afternoon."   "I know but still," I add.  "We did what we were suppose to do. Think about how many people will be familiar with our concepts."  "I know, Mike but still...."  "We have to go," Mike says. I follow. Two steps behind. Smelling like sage. Wondering what crazy adventure we'll happen to slouch upon next.

      All my life my father believed in angels. There were no angelic frills. No golden visions or beatific quills found on our sidewalk raked up in bushy heaps on autumnal weekends. There were no esoteric dreams transcripted by clairvoyants as being quote Divine. There were no epiphanies. No refulgent frisbee sized halo's tossed in our drive-way. There were no hallucinations. My father drank instant coffee. He taught fourth graders Mon-Fri and Sunday school on the weekend.  He kept his Portals of Prayer and his blue-ink underlined Bible at his bedside. He memorized scripture. He never touched my mother before God had made them of one flesh. They went to a Christian conference for their honeymoon. Mother insisted on giving the money Dad had saved for her diamond ring to the church, opting for a less-elegant engagement ring. He was a very practical and modest Christian who loved singing folk-songs to his three young children for nightly devotions. Instead of cursing when he was mad he would say the words "crow" or "H-e-double-hockey sticks."  And he believed in angels.  He also saw them.   I first noticed this when I was five fingers old. Dad and I had walked to the library. It was late-autumn and a premature winter gale had started to flap from the North. It was the early eighties--blue and white graffiti'd phonebooths correlated perfectly with bobing CB antenaes and blaring traffic assaults. Father was dressed in his gray sweater and orange stocking cap. My vision was knee-high and blurred. We were walking down Main street when I noticed that my father had lagged behind. He was talking to a old, haggard shaped woman with silver threads and warts riddled acrossed her face. Dad was reaching into his pocket, pinching open his coin purse. The woman looked like cigarette ash and exhaust but Dad seemed friendly as he carefully picked through the coins and placing them in her cupped palms.   "What were you doing with that old lady over there, Dad?" I asked. My eyes dual-ochre buttons suddenly widened that my dad would talk to someone he didn't know. Someone who looked poor.  "She wanted to know if she could have money for coffee." Dad said, very quickly.  "You gave that old lady money?" I asked again. My father nodded, very quickly, his chin wobbling as if his conscience were involved in a balancing act and he was afraid to fall.  "She needed money for coffee." Was all he said, walking very quickly, insisting that I walk on his left, in case of errant traffic.   *  The next Angel my father perceived would appear in the spring. Our house was up on the bluff, overlooking the South Side. Father had swept the Vice Lords off the roof of his station wagon earlier in the day. Often, I would come home and find the rim of my basketball hoop slooping down south, showing reverence for the gravel below.  Dad had planted an aluminum fence around the house. He was father of three. He was careful who his kids talked to. He yelled at older boys hurtling firecrackers at cats in the alley.   The angel was wearing a tanktop and crooked glasses. He has a red hankerchief wrapped around his denim pantlegs like a tourniquet. He had tattoos on his shoulders that looked like they were inked using actual human arteries.  Dad was watering one of his hostas he had to replant becasue it kept being uprooted by the neighboorhood ruffians. The Angel looked at dad and told him that he was a vet who hadn't eaten in three days. Dad sent me further in the caged lawn. He went into the house to talk with mom. He came back out and handed the man a wad of green bills. Then he invited him to our church on Sunday.  An hour later Dad went to the gas station to put air in the tire's of my bicycle. On the bustop he saw the angel. The angel was smoking cigarettes, talking very fast with his hands. The angel was drinking out of a vase tightly-wrapped in a brown paper bag. The Angel and Dad exchanged looks and then the Angel yelled something and Dad shielded my ears with his calloused palms. He told me that we had to get home.  The next day Dad bent over and replanted the uprooted hosta.        *   I can't say that I'm right there with the old man. I've never seen an Angel. I never even saw my dad cried. My Father's Father, my grandfather, died suddenly of a heart-attack when I was six-months old. Dad always told me that he would have wrestled. That we would have gone fishing. That the two of us would have been buddies.  Apparently Dad cried at his own father's death.  When grandmother died in '98 all of her children, their spouses and children tearfully slumped around her hospital bed. My Aunt Linn is the head of the choir at the Lutheran church where my family has dutifully tithed for decades. I got the call at work that my grandmother was dying.  "Doctor estimates that it should be some time today." Mom says. "We're all over here singing."  I left work, picked up two boxes of donuts and a thermos of coffee from Dunkin' Donuts and headed to the hospital.   "Why are hospitals always so bleach-white?" I thought to myself. "Why does the building where we enter and leave this planet smell like piss and disenfectant? Why does the sum total of ones earthly experiences seem to rotate around the sliding-doors of the hospital and in your proximity to them."  Everyone was huddled around my grandmother's hospital bed. Chemotherapy had deprived her of her golden spume of hair. Grandma was plugged into a ventilator. Her body bellowed and writhed and squinted. Her face had transitioned into a beautiful rosemary hue and there were voices rushed around her. My mom and Aunt brought out old blue copies of the Lutheran Worship. This is how grandmother left this earthly portal, with the voices the harvest she had cultivated crescendoing in her ears. With uncle Larry unable to breach his thick bass monotone above the black rungs of the lower southern cleft. With her wayward academic insurgent grandson (her only grandson carrying the Von Behren name) swigging coffee and sporadically going outside to smoke. She left with her daughter in-laws voice resonating loudly in the room, with her oldest son Arthur sounding very modest in his voice, the only one in the room not crying, not going up to grandmother and kissing her cheek and saying goodbye.   Grandmothers hospital room was co-inhabited. There was an elderly black woman named Grace to my grandmothers right. She was also in the hospital for cancer treatment. My Aunt asked her if she would mind, given the circumstances if we could sing, and she said she would be delighted. When grandma started to pass a nurse tried wheeling Grace out of the room, but Grace adamantly insisted on staying. She said she was fine. She was around family.  A week after Grandma's funeral my Father and my Uncle went to go visit Grace. She lived on the South side of Peoria not far from where Grandma's church was loactaed. Dad had found out from the hospital that Grace had been released two days after Grandmother died, and the hospital had been nice enough to avail her address, so that my Uncle and Father could visit her, bring her a bouquet and express their gratitude.   When they got to Grace's doorstep a young black lady in curllers answered.  "Ain't no one name Grace ever lived here."  "Sure she does," My father says. "She was in St. Francis last week."  "Ain't no woman by that name or description ever lived here." The lady says again, before slamming the door.  "That's weird," My uncle says to my father, turning around from the closed door, a bouquet of chrysanthemums slowly silting near his waist.  "Maybe she was an angel." Dad said, humbly as the two brothers walked down to their respective vehicles.  *       In my late teens and early twenties I was often pissed off at my father b/c I felt that he didn't care about any of my own ambitions while he truckled to my precocious sibblings every whim. I was always working and going to school and trying to read and trying to write and Father's advice would always be, "Do what God wants you to do." and I'm like, check, ok, right on, whose God? Christ was crucified becasue he said that "I and the Father are One." Which means he was crucified becasue he felt a mystic rapport permeating through all things--and he felt that he was part of that divine ribbon.   I was living at home by myself, both my sisters were younger than me but were away at boarding schools or colleges. To assuage my purported literary apprehnsive and my accruing sense of loneliness I drank cheap beer like a broken faucet after work. I can only imagine what my father thought of his son, smelling like stable yeast with cobbled stubble dotted along his chin walking around the house with a copy of "On the Road" tucked under his armpit, sounding like he was perenially prepping for his SAT verbal.  There was an angel Dad would assist every summer. A black man in a white undershirt and fishing cap with bad teeth. Every summer this man would appear on our front lawn like a ceramic garden gnome and dad would assign him very menial work like stuffing mulch around the trees in the back yard and then pay him very sufficiently.   I was up in my room pouring tin soldiers down my throat when I heard the black man outside whistling and saw him hunched over our garden. I had been swamped with grubbing customers all day while my boss had left me in charge to screw the Manager of Famous Dave's in the backroom. I was livid.  "Why do you keep assisting these people?" I told my dad. He was in the living room reading a book by Max Lucado. "They're just milking you for all your worth."  Dad was quiet. He could smell my harden breath. He could see that I was tired from working. That I was just tired from living.  A week before the local paper did an article about my youngest sister Jenn. She was somewhat of a violin phenom and father later said that the one thing he was most proud of in the article was that Jenn "Gave God the Glory" when the journalist asked her about her talent.  "You care about these people more than you care about your own son." I told him, he was still quiet. He could see that tears had incubated inside the pools of my eyes.  "I can't even get you to co-sign on a college loan for me and here you are helping total strangers." I pleaded.  "They're not total strangers," Dad said, very quietly.  "Neither am I," I pelted back slamming the front door as hard as I could, yelling back at my father to go fuck his skewed belief system. To go fuck his god. To go fuck everything he holds as being important.  As I walked outside en route to the Pakistani liquer store I saw the angel, whistling to himself. He was padding the bottom of a hosta. He looked at me smiled and tipped his hat. I made it an overt point in looking the other direction, pretending that he didn't exist. That he didn't exist at all.   *  I spent the last two weeks of my father's life living with Lisa, a classy Bussiness woman I had met at a wine diner a week before. She was fifteen years older than I was, wore sexy Bussiness suits, chatted incessantly into her cell phones to potential clientale. She kissed ass, ripped off people, boasted about her portfoilo, went to the gym after work, sweated, drank like she was supporting her local aqaurium on the weekend. I was teaching during the day and would come home to her red tresses and smooth body. My father had just been diagnosed with cancer but we thought that he would be alright. He was fifty-four, never smoked and drank very modestly if he ever drank at all. He was still teaching fourth graders two weeks before his death. There was fifteen years between myself and Lisa and exactly fifteen years between Lisa and my father.     Lisa first met my father on his death bed. She came to the hospital and immediately started to massage his feet. Dad's whole body was jaundice and sallow--cheap unfizzled beer salvaged from happy hour. The cancer had pushed into every celled fortress of his body. His unblinking eyes were copper and his mouth was spittled open. He was leaving. He was leaving so quickly.  As his family stood over his body rolling tears form their sockets. As we embraced and tried to discern just what the fuck was going on, as Father bellowed his last breath, and at the moment of death, when the body drifts from comatose to commodity, when the body becomes future fertlizer, dormant, worthless, all the vitality licked out---only then I saw it. Father wasn't wearing his glasses. His gray hair was rumpled and unkempt like an aged academics and his skin was so yellow that it almost appeared golden. Squinting through wreathed tears I saw him. He was an angel. I could make out his wings through the carnival of tears. He was an angel and somehow, I knew (although I wouldn't admit it until years later) that he was flapping his wings home.

      ...Quick Blog as promised for Daniela...I've been hemming, planting and wrestling with Baha'i kids all night.  "I have a new game, lets play hit David."  Oh well, I was trying to water plants (real plants--non-plastic) and  lil' Dustin and Macey kept messing with the hose so that everytime I thought the water was dry I would feign village idiot and look into the nozzle and they would  twist the spriket and I would get soaked which is all fun and laughs at first but gets old around round 30.   Anyway, I heard a cool story about Pearl form Mike two days ago. Apparently she had a very 'arayesque' dream where she was taken by the Master himself up to some sort of Heaven. They had a long discourse but Pearl was really intrigued by what appeared to be flecks of lights scattered all throughout the planet.  "Those are Baha'i souls." The master said.  Later in Pearls life she was usurped in a dream again and the Master pointed back down at the planet. More lights, bottled translucent flecks were visible, and they were beaming with even more radiance.  The faith had spread. Even in her own lifetime. It had spread very far indeed.  Time to crash. What's important is not the vehicle, but the light. Peace.

      Here's the song I have in my head right now. It's by my favorite local band Freudian Press. If you want to know what I look like click here http://freudianpress.indiegroup.com/ Charlie is my lookalike and at the last gig there was a rumor circulated around the bar that I was his estranged brother!!!!   Another Black Day  I walk out the door to the street and I say It looks almost just like how it did yesterday I drive off to work to get bread in my jar Now my jar ain't so empty, but I haven't got far  Up since the dawn, and I sang through the morning Hip-Hip Hooray for another black day Everything's turned around, and I'm hanging upside down Hip-Hip Hooray for another black day  I've seen lonely men try to live in the past I've seen lonely couples try to let it just last I wish I could tell them that I've felt the same But they don't want the truth, they just want someone to blame  Up since the dawn, and I sang through the morning Hip-Hip Hooray for another black day Everything's turned around, and I'm fucking upside down Hip-Hip Hooray for another black day  I've seen it first hand, how a war makes a man And I know that their truths I just can't understand I've been through the fire, and the wake of the flood And I've stepped in the grave that my forefathers dug  Up since the dawn and I sang through the morning Hip-Hip Hooray for another black day Everything's turned around, I'm fucking upside down Hip-Hip Hooray for another black day  -words and music by Charlie Bennet

      Once again Mark-Andrew is in the corner. His face flapped into a pout, his arms tucked into his chest. Perhaps he is somewhere behind the avenues and curves of these sentences, dodged behind the locomotive whir, constantly rapping his knuckles at the pixilated computer screen, pointing at his watch, insinuating that, "I thought you made a covenant with your readers to scribble daily about thoses souls that whipped and tamed your persona?" Indeed, I made an appointment and I am far from overdue.                                   *             "Stanwood Cobb always wanted to live to be 100." Mike told me, this afternoon, inbetween shifts, while we were out purchasing plants for our garden.     "Did he," I inquir lifting up a hush of Juniper. A bushel of rosemary bog. Uncle Mike just shrugs.    "The last time I saw him lecture he was 95." Mike says. "He came down to see Pearl. He would often contact Pearl concerning spiritual matters." Mike pauses. We pass frosted shrubs. "He would always have his lectures outside, often at night, under the stars. He hated lecturing inside for some reason."   Mike admires a yucca plant. I try not to make overt eye-contact with the jean-overall checkout girl punching digits into a register.      "He would often tell Pearl that he wanted to live to be 100 and she would just smile and say, "Now, Stanwood, why."    "So he was the first American Baha'i." I say, my brain squinting, trying to remember details.    "He was the first American intellectual who became Baha'i." Uncle Mike amends as he hands me a potted lilac. I place it in the cart. The checkout girl is still looking at the register like it is hi-tech dentistry equipment sponsored by NASA.    Mike presses what looks like an infant rhododendron into my chest.         "So you knew him" I inquire again. Mike nods.     "He would come to Pearl for spiritual advice. Everyone would come to Pearl for spiritual insight in those days."    "Tell me a story about him," I demand, our cart fused with dirty pots and botany as we wend our way over to the checkout lane. Mike pauses. His eyes once again avert up into his skull.      "`Abdu'l-Bahá healed Stanwood." He says. Our plants being scanned by something that looks like a miniature skull with a neon forehead.   "What do you mean?" I retort.    "Stanwood used to suffer from bouts of depression." Mike says.  "Horrible bouts of depression. Most people you admire--so many artists and thinkers suffered from just horrible, unbelievable 'bouts of depression."   "And`Abdu'l-Bahá healed him?" I asked again. Michael nodded.    "Stanwood used to suffer recurring bouts of depression. One day`Abdu'l-Bahá was siting next to Stanwood as he transcribed tablets. Stanwood was immersed very deeply in his studies. The next thing Stanwood knew he felt a warm presence surrounding him. The master had given him a hug."    "A hug?" I inquired a little squeamishly.    "Yes," Mike says "And Stanwood was healed. He never suffered a single-bout of depression again."     I think about that for a moment as Uncle Mike swipes his credit card and autographs the receipt. I think about what it must be like to be healed by an embraced. I think about what Stanwodd Cobb, a purported "intellectual" must have felt the moment he was brushed up against the Master's perfumed cloak. Was the intellectual 'embarrased' at first that he was given an embrace, of did he feel unalloyed warmth--the tickle of `Abdu'l-Bahá's beard swiping the side of Stanwoods face like the freshly indented edge of a paintbrush.          I think about this as we leave the Greenhouse. I think about illness and suffering and pain. I think about medication and exorbitant medical bills. I think about people whose bodies are gradually waning; whose organs are solidifying; whose breath is escaping their lips.  And I think about`Abdu'l-Bahá squeezing Stanwood Cobb. Squeezing him so hard that somehow, whatever impediment that saddled his health inside was released. I think about that as I walk out of the Greenhouse, shoving a cart full of green stems and paneled leafs.  And I think about what the checkout girl must think as she sees me walking next to Uncle Mike. Does she ponder the incongruity of our appearance? Does she wonder what this crazy long-haired tree-hugger is doing flanked with this tall, elderly suited man with thick glasses, baseball diamond goatee and a strange look of eternity melted into his furrowed brow.  I wonder if she is privy of our conversation, and I wonder if she pried open our lips up, I wonder what she would find hiding there, beneath the turf of our tongues.

      The recital will resume tomorrow with another wordy entry concerning the knighted protagonist of my youth Mark-Andrew Feaster. It is germinating as we speak, lodged in the BLOG draft files.      Had dinner with two older Bahai's tonight and heard all about crazy cats Stanward Cobb and David Hoffman. Also digested a beautiful little anecdotal gumdrop concerning Ruhhiyih Khanum. In the 70's, when he was living in Haifa, my roommate Mike would visit Khanum on a weekly basis (She always called him the "Trouble-shooter"). Mike had heard a rumor that Khanum once owned a tweny-five foot long snake. When he accosted her about the reptile she simply smiled.  "Wanna see it?" She inquired, which of course, my roommate, crazy Mike the mystical trouble-shooter that he still is today, quickly responded in the affirmative to her invitation.  Khanum purportedly went upstairs to the house of Abdu'l-baha, ferrying a Parisian hatbox hugged around her arms upon return. The two of them went out into the garden and got down on their knees. When Khanum opened the box, she unveiled a snake slough, over twenty-feet long! To the dismay of onlookers, both of them unraveled the snake skin, laughing the whole time.  I also brought up the whole Jungian synchronous physical-world-is nothing-but-a-staged-illusion-and-once-you-tug-at-the-metaphysical-pulleys-and-reel-back-the-curtain-you-can-discern-that-corporeal-reality-is-nothing-more-than-a-tinted-shadow issue that has appropriated much of our blogging discourses this past week. Mike sort've digressed and told another story about how the present material world helps us out as well. Apparently Abdu'l-baha owned a fur coat even though some critics dismissed it as being material and a tad gaudy.   "But the servant of Bahá was very practical." Mike said laughing.  "Practical?" I said, my brow furrowed.  "Yes," Mike said. "He wore the fur coat when it was cold outside. Plus he used to sleep on it."  "Sleep on it?" I said, again, volleying back the same crooked look.  "Yes," Mike said again, still laughing. "It kept the fleas out."  "Kept the flees out," I said to myself amist a smash of laughter.

      The curtain is still up at the recital and thank god none of the props have tumbled over!!! The orchestra has finished tuning and a dual-tailed conductor is ticking his orchestral antenae sharply on the top of a music stand. Pattered palms have transitioned from golf-claps into complete silence. There is the moment before the thick tonal chords foam and brush over foreheads and in this moment, somehow, on the stage, there is a picture of a female being formed, almost as if in the womb, she is turning like her whole entire body is a neon ferris wheel. Music licks earlobes swifter than lips, quicker than sight and a photograph of Jasna Snrdic apporpiates both mind and heart. Her hair is snipped short, sliced autumal red, and she walks on corduroy stilts, lanky ivory appendages, the back of her pants slightly sagging, bangs drooping into her vision. This is Jasna Srndic...she is an artist, a survivor, a pixie, a sprite. She grew up in war-tattered Yugoslavia. Her father was exiled for political purposes. She has been speaking english for less than a half-decade and she is a semester shy of graduating college. She is male and female, yin and yang, exiled and invited. And everytime she says my name it sounds like this: "           DAVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED  "    Jasna spotted me several times before I had ever seen her. I was in the process of writing my first book, dropping out of college and having a few beers while I'm at it. Instead of studiously laboring over homework, I spent hours slapping out cheap sentences into microsoft word, trying to engender charcters and express a crazy verisimilitude. I had read too many "erudite" ugly books (Ulysses, Gravity's Rainbow, The Recognitions) and emulated their pedantic writing styles to the point of nauseation. I was dating a prof. ten years older than me back home who it turned out had an estranged husband and called me up sozzled one night,informing me that she had know found someone new, someone who looked just like me (long hair) but was her age.     I was merely a docile Pompeii to her capricious, unforgiving Vesuvius.     Jasna found me, in the computer lab, sawing off horribly shaped sentences for my book. She had her hair cut short and wore a thick sweaters so that her sex was by no means readily discerned. I was pounding out homerow mantras and she was laughing, a duclet laugh, hiccuping across the room, landing sideways on my shoulder. She was smiling at me, telling me that she had seen me from across the quad. She had seen me lugging books into my room, she had seen me here in the computer lab, flicking out sounds of snapped plastic and looking serious, oh, did I ever look so serious was I a writer? She asked. Could I be Herman Hesse she asked.  She kept laughing. Her smile sprinkled with cosmic glitter.  "I see you all time and never you seem to see me." She said, talking in beautiful curled; heavily twisted sentences void of articles. I looked at her (still trying to discern her sex--she looked like Peter Pan!) and offered her serious blather about aesthetics; collegiate bosh.  "You are serious. You look so serious everytime you I see." She ascertained, looking at the inside of my hands, as if perusing an interstate map. Then she began to laugh. "You crazy. Daveeeeeed is crazy."  She said. Although I still couldn't tell what 'she' was.  Her name was Jasna (Yahz-nuh)and she was an artist. We would go on walks and she would pick up scattered leaves and hold them up into the orange patches of dusk. She would collect acorns and milkweeds. The grayish-taupe of a midwesteren autumn seemed to melt into her art. She was a painter. She had a painting at the MCA in Chicago! She was also a photographer. She had pictures of a Wilmette centered papal-hatted shaped building in her room. Both of us had no clue what the building was used for.  Her hair was trimmed exceedingly military short when I met her. She talked with torched nostalgia of Yugoslavia, of her grandparents who were left there, alone, spending the last years of their lives together. She talked about ethnic-cleansing. Her father was Islam. Her mother was christian. Neither of them were practicing. She talked of her sister who liked boys, of her sister who was a pharmacist in Vienna, she talked of her art teacher in Yugoslavia who she hadn't heard form in a long time because communication lines had somehow been severed....  ....over the years there have been friends, lovers, associates, e-mail affinities, ersatz crushes, blogging buddies, townies, hippies, indulgent artists, anarchists, single-minded philosophers, material-driven yuppies and there has been Jasna, a friend I took for granted for a long time. She would slip elfish-slovanian writing on little slips of brown paper beneath the door in my dorm. She would leave me delicately wrapped sandwhiches. She would compare me to Demian in Hesse's novel. She would stare at the pictures of Ganesh and Shiva on my wall as if they were a branch steming off the same genealogical trunk.   She would also create art.   Three years younger and she was already three times the artist I'll ever be. At her request (reluctantly) I severed thick tressed of my hair and she tied them together, placed them in her apartment.   "Look, Daveeeeeeed." She said, pointing at thinly hair stalactites.  "What," I said, hardly noticing.  "No," She said. "Look past hair. Look at shadow hair creates. Look how it moves slightly, delicately."  She was right. The focus was the shadow, created by the light, shifted gravitationally throughout the day. We would hold each other in winter, in her apartment, her body smelled like nutmag and chestnuts, we would hold each other in a platonic bite and we would watch the shadow. Diaphnous ledger lines on sheet music, altered by the slight tug of a planet; a planet interfacing with a giant thermonuclear hearth, 93 million miles away.  Jasna also had charcoal pictures of trees in her room. All over her room. Black and white photographs of friends and smeared charcoal branches of trees.  "Tree's name is AVA," she said, offering the world her crooked ply-wood smile. "It is  tree we walked under first day  we met, remember?" It was the tree I used to read her stories underneath. Whenever I read her a story, even a menial paragraph, she would pogo noth and south smile and clap, like a observant mother watching her newborn crawl for the first time. Even the bad stories, which, even today, sprout nocturnally like whiskers.  "Ava," I said, musing.  "She never told you her name. But her name Ava. She tree from Yugoslavia." Jasna says.  Sometimes we would walk and Jasna would take off sprinting, for no reason, Yugoslovian sunset smile still soaked into her face. Sometimes, she would whisper things to me, as we would cuddle, saying the same vexing Amercain phrase over and over again in almost a scraped whisper.  "There no more time Daveeeeed." She said, quietly.  "Shut up." I would say, drowsed in sleep, her hiccuping into a whisper again.  "There time no more Daveeeeeeed."                                            *      But Jasna has been there. Poor herself, the summer I took off to write she sent me money for food and RENT, even though I didn't ask for it. She listened when I blathered about my romantic histrionics. When I phoned the saturday after my father's funeral she melted the airwaves with tears, tears for a man she had never met, but had perhaps, like Shive and Ganesh, she had somehow known.  Jasna and I have a friendship where we slip into each other and out---like strands on a DNA fiber, we find each other, weave out, circle a set of microscopic rungs called life, and until our individual strands sew into each other again. The last time I saw her I fulfilled a vow and took her dancing, at a gay bar no less.  "They not care here Daveeeeed. They are open."   "I don't want to dance." I said, under the kaledioscopic gash of lights.  "It's easy." Said Jasna. As she set aside her drink and began to pogo up and down, as if she were on a matress, twelve years younger, and her americain parents were away for the weekend.  "Here, Daveeeeeeed." She said, groping my hand, and we danced. We swirled, crashed into each other, apologized to a Queen whose Zima had slipped away form her like a glass scepter, but still, under the stuttering electronic lights of the dance floor, we lost track of our shadows, we lost track of time and we would again arrive back to her apartment and hold each other--simply hold each other, the moment the strand is unionized.  And the last time I saw her, when I said goodbye, the bus that I was suppose to be on was late. We would say goodbye, kiss each others cheeks, I would grapple my luggage and the bus driver would apologize, say that the bus that was suppose to be was behind schedule and would arrive in fiftten. Fifteen minutes later, at the sight of the aluminum hyphen we would embrace again, seed kisses into each others cheeks again, and I would grip the leather lobes of my suitcase to once again be informed that the bus I needed was still running late.  "Here," Jasna said, reeling a scrolled-telescopic shaped cylinder form her own bag.  "What's this?" I inquired.  "Open," She said, her beaded eyes averted, as if looking for the bus I was to take home. WHen I spread open the scroll it was a charcoal rendering of what I perceived to be a tree.  "Ava?" I asked, looking at the portly trunk flaring off into desoalte autumnal branches.  "No Daveeeeeeeed." Jasna said, " Daveeeeeeeeeed so silly."  "What is it then?" I asked, just as another bus the bus I was to take home, the bus that would charter me back to my home, back to my 80 work week, back to the pain and perils of commerce and civilization.  "Your bus," Jasna said, as we embraced once again, only quickly this time.  "Jasna," I said, inquring about the origins. The bus driver was sliding luggage beneath the steel guts of the bus. He was shouting tickets.  "It's you Daveeeeeeeed." Jasna said again. "It's your hands."  I looked again but she pushed and I fell upward, somehow, on to the bus. Knowing that I had just broken away (although only momentarily) form that friend whom I shared something inexplicable and sacred with. That person who I loved, only not in a way I loved say Swissy-Missy or the prof. who lauded me with compliments and then smiled duplicitously into foreign shadows.  The next thing I know I was on the bus and I was looking out, looking out past the dual-tint of my own shadow, out at Jasna, waving at me as the bus mechanically spurted and droned and lumbered towards the thick curve of the interstate. A scrolled charcoal rendering of my hands curved in my fist; and Jasna, the elusive adrogynous sprite who found me one day, a day when I was being too serious; the creature who stretches out the vowels  in the center of my name, the person who planted my calloused palms and made stringed marionetted shadows with my own hair; I saw that person waving at me, an acorn smile gnawed at her lips, and looked at her waving until she became a button and then she became no more.

      Here's a few Joyful thoughts by Uncle walt I've been reflecting over today...parlty because it's been a sandpaper- rough emotional abrading week, partly because my co-workers are still acting like royal you-know-what's.....enjoy (sorry Uncle Walt's Song of Joy's are smashed into a poetic heap).....  Yet, O my soul supreme! Know’st thou the joys of pensive thought? Joys of the free and lonesome heart—the tender, gloomy heart?Joy of the solitary walk—the spirit bowed yet proud—the suffering and the struggle? The agonistic throes, the extasies—joys of the solemn musings, day or night? Joys of the thought of Death—the great spheres Time and Space? Prophetic joys of better, loftier love’s ideals—the Divine Wife—the sweet, eternal, perfect Comrade? Joys all thine own, undying one—joys worthy thee, O Soul.&nbsp; 16O, while I live, to be the ruler of life—not a slave, To meet life as a powerful conqueror, No fumes—no ennui—no more complaints, or scornful criticisms. &nbsp; O me repellent and ugly! To these proud laws of the air, the water, and the ground, proving my interior Soul impregnable,And nothing exterior shall ever take command of me. &nbsp; O to attract by more than attraction! How it is I know not—yet behold! the something which obeys none of the rest, It is offensive, never defensive—yet how magnetic it draws. &nbsp; 17O joy of suffering!To struggle against great odds! to meet enemies undaunted! To be entirely alone with them! to find how much one can stand! To look strife, torture, prison, popular odium, death, face to face! To mount the scaffold! to advance to the muzzles of guns with perfect nonchalance! To be indeed a God!&nbsp; 18O, to sail to sea in a ship! To leave this steady, unendurable land! To leave the tiresome sameness of the streets, the sidewalks and the houses; To leave you, O you solid motionless land, and entering a ship, To sail, and sail, and sail!&nbsp; 19O to have my life henceforth a poem of new joys! To dance, clap hands, exult, shout, skip, leap, roll on, float on, To be a sailor of the world, bound for all ports, A ship itself, (see indeed these sails I spread to the sun and air,) A swift and swelling ship, full of rich words—full of joys.

      ...or are you just happy to see me? Hello Hermoine!!! It's love-o-my-life&nbsp;J.K. Rowlings birthday this weekend, and although she's already comfortably married, I still harbor fantasies of marriage with Miss Rawlings and all the magic a Hogwarts Honeymoon would entail.  "Quiddith, anyone?"  When I read Order of the Phoneix last summer I just cried. I know what's it's like to be a younger writer who's piss poor and who writes and dreams and witnesses their vision blossom into fruition. Miss Rawlings constructs&nbsp;paragraphs&nbsp;of such&nbsp;sublime&nbsp;linearity that they could easily serve as a butress for Gothic Cathedrals. Attagirl J.K. !!!  Here's what the Writer's Almanac says this week about Miss Rawlings:  "As a child, Rowling was short and stocky and wore very thick glasses, just like Harry Potter. She says she was very bossy, very bookish and terrible at school. When Rowling started writing Harry Potter, she was unemployed and divorced and living on public assistance in a tiny Edinburgh apartment with her infant daughter. She wrote during her daughter's naps, at a table in a café. She couldn't afford even a used typewriter. Then the Scottish Arts Council gave her a grant to finish the book. She did, and in the U.S. it was called Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (1998). It was a dramatic overnight success. She was instantly famous and Harry Potter became a household name. She experienced a level of fame usually reserved for politicians and rock stars. On book tours, she spoke at big sporting venues, with images of her face projected on big screens behind her. At age thirty-five she was the highest-earning woman in Britain, netting more than thirty million dollars in 2000. Rowling has had the plots mapped out for a series of seven Harry Potter books since 1995. There's a book for each year that Harry spends at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She said, "I want to finish these seven books and look back and think that whatever happened—however much this hurricane whirled around me—I stayed true to what I wanted to write. This is my Holy Grail: that when I finish writing book seven, I can say—hand on heart—I didn't change a thing. I wrote the story I meant to write."   Rowling released Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix on June 21 last year. Within an hour, Barnes and Noble, the largest bookseller in the country, had sold 286,000 copies. That's eighty books per second. By the end of the day the book had sold five million copies total."

      "I guess," said Zoe.&nbsp; She wished she could think of a joke, something&nbsp;slow and deliberate with the end in sight.&nbsp; She thought about gorillas, how when they had been kept too long alone in cages they would smack each other on the head instead of mating.   -Lorrie Moore, "You're Ugly, Too"   *  "But if you don't want to work your ass off, you have no bussiness trying to right well--settle back&nbsp; into competency and be grateful that you have even that much to fall back on. There is a muse, but he's not going to come fluttering down into your writing room scattering creative fairy-dust over your typewriter or computer station. He lives in the ground. He's a basement guy. You have to descend to his level and once you get down there you have to furnish an apartment for him to live in. You have to do all the grunt labor, in other words,&nbsp; while the muse sits and smokes cigars and admires his bowling trophies and pretends to ignore you. Do you think this is fair? I think it's fair.&nbsp; He may not be&nbsp;much to look at, that muse-guy, and he may not be much of a conversationalist, but he's got&nbsp;the inspiration. It's right that you should do all the work and burn all the midnight oil, because the guy with the cigar and the little wings has got a bag of magic. There's stuff in there that can change your life.   "Believe&nbsp;me, I know."   -Stephen King, "On Writing"   &nbsp;   *  His eyes lit up. He wanted to talk about love. " But I keep thinking love should be like a tree. You look at trees and they've got bumps and scars from tumors, infestations, what have you, but they're still growing. Despite the bumps and bruises, they're--straight."   -Lorrie Moore, "You're Ugly, Too"

      "&nbsp; What the hell's going on, I wonder. Frank Martin uncrosses his arms and takes a puff on the cigar.&nbsp; He lets the smoke carry out of his mouth.&nbsp; Then he raises his chin towards the hills and says, "Jack London used to have a big place on the other side of this valley.&nbsp; Right over there behind that green hill you're looking at.&nbsp; But alcohol killed him. Let that be a lesson.&nbsp; He was a better man than any of us. But he couldn't handle the stuff, either." He looks at what's left of his cigar.&nbsp; It's gone out. He tosses it into the bucket.&nbsp; "You guys want to read something while you're here, read that book of his The Call of the Wild. You know the one I'm talking about? We have it inside, if you want to read something. &nbsp;It's about this animal that's half dog and half wolf. They don't write books like that anymore. But we could have helped Jack London, if we'd been here in those days. And if he'd let us. If he'd ask for our help. Hear me? Like we can help you. If. If you ask for it and if you listen. End of sermon. But don't forget. If," he says again. Then he hitches his pants and tugs his sweater down. "I'm going inside," He says. " See you at lunch."   "I feel like a bug when he's around," J.P says. "He makes me feel like a bug. Something you could step on." J.P shakes his head. Then he says. "Jack London. What a name! I wish I had a name like that. Instead of the name I got."   -Raymond Carver, "Where I'm calling&nbsp;From"&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Been generously sifting through old heaps of books all week. Books that cranked my creative generator in the formative years...I came across my first ever book of prose/poetry by Kahil Gibran and can still remember when I bought it in High school, at Willow Tree second hand books&nbsp;near the north side of Town.&nbsp;Willow Tree&nbsp;heavily reeked&nbsp;of moldy-cardboard and thick, dusty old paperbacks with jaundice pages. Beautiful Rachael, the girl with the china-doll&nbsp;ashen face, velvet choker and thick black hair that hung over her bosom like renaissance drapes in the Louvre guided me to the poetry section. She&nbsp;was studying English at Southern Illinois University but had just dropped out for reasons she chose not&nbsp;to share.&nbsp;   Rachael wore thick burgundy fairy-tale dresses and bracelets. She was always sitting in perrfect erect posture&nbsp;reading&nbsp;behind the counter; her&nbsp;glazed&nbsp;marble-eyes stared&nbsp;into&nbsp;her current hymnal&nbsp;like she was gazing through stain glass in a&nbsp;eurpoean cathedral at dawn. I used to flirt with her. I had already been to Europe twice and was myself a "Poe-it" my unfledged poems, a branch stemming from the thick trunk of ego that someday, (thankfully) would be gradually axed into pools of&nbsp;saw dust.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;She told me she had&nbsp;dabbled in poems herself, that she&nbsp;possesed a poets heart,&nbsp;only&nbsp;her professors in college had told her the her original&nbsp;poetical-tithes weren't very good. She played George Winston, enya and&nbsp;early "Under the Pink" Tori Amos in the store. There&nbsp;was a cat she called Dorien Gray&nbsp;that "lived"&nbsp;underneath the sky-line of books. There was a stash of&nbsp;complimentary Herbal-organic&nbsp;tea that I stole a box of once and snorted&nbsp;and then periscopically floated around in a helium&nbsp;cotton-cloud&nbsp;lavender haze for days.   And there was A TREASURY OF&nbsp;Kahil Gibran, a book of short stories which one-ups The&nbsp;Prophet. As the introduction made note, oddly enough, Gibran's short stories were often&nbsp;more mystical than his poems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I remember the night I first read Gibran's short story THE TEMPEST. I remember how each page smelled like an old leaf&nbsp;salvaged from&nbsp;previous autumns. I remembered the wayfarer getting purposefully abandoned in the Tempest, so he could take refuge with a&nbsp;reclusive Hermit and hopefully&nbsp;glean a shred of mystical insight.&nbsp;  I remember how my bed was made with the quilt mother had&nbsp;stitched for me. How I had&nbsp;Ralphael&nbsp;and Renoir and Durer&nbsp;paintings tacked to my wall. How I had snap-shots of&nbsp;Big Ben and the Eiffle tower and&nbsp;a closet full of the old suits my cool Italian&nbsp;Granpa&nbsp;Frank used to wear-- fashionable 1940's jackets I'd wear to high&nbsp;school&nbsp;amd smile when I was mistaken by faculty&nbsp;as a Student Teacher.   I remember how I used to tape the&nbsp;Texaco Opera broadcasts. How I planned on proposing to Cecelia Bartoli on her next American tour. How I would&nbsp;attentively listen to&nbsp;The Writers Almanac every afternoon, at Three fifty-four, after cranking out an article for the&nbsp;school&nbsp;newspaper. I&nbsp;collected weekly editions of the BOOK sections shed&nbsp;from the chicago tribune.&nbsp;Everytime I read an article and came across a word I didn't know, I would circle the word and&nbsp;punch&nbsp;the &nbsp;definition into a word calculator my father had given me.&nbsp;   I misused words all the time in highschool. My highschool was more adept in churning out gangster disciples than it was&nbsp;Rhodes&nbsp;scholars but&nbsp;a few of the older teachers seemed to be amused by my forged poetic parlance. I told&nbsp;fiery red-haired Karen Strickler&nbsp;that it was very "pensive" of her to think about me over the holidays because I had read that the word "pensive" meant "thoughtful".&nbsp; I wrote a detailed paper about teen-angst and depression in a prozac marketed economy&nbsp;where I discussed the on-going perils of teen accentuation (A word I derived from 'accentuate' to emphasize&nbsp;'stress' as on a&nbsp;syllable, not on a person).&nbsp;I remember very vivdly having my senior high school teacher&nbsp;lacerate my paper on "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"&nbsp;out loud chiding my excessive brooklynite-big poofy haired&nbsp;voacbulary so that my peers, a scattered handfall of sloped-scholars in a high school that boasted the Highest teenage Pregnancy rate in the nation my senior year, chuckled and derided me for weeks after. &nbsp;When I finally broke up with Jana Solomon (for good this time, I swear)&nbsp;she adamantly informed me that I misused the word 'facade' all the time in our relationship, and she knew words because her Uncle had&nbsp;reviewed Rick Moody's&nbsp;Purple America&nbsp;for the Tribune.&nbsp;&nbsp;   But words. Buckeling the perfect word in the perfectly constructed sentence; strapping it into the confines of the paragraph as&nbsp; delicately one would strap a child into a&nbsp;car seat.   There's no&nbsp;greater time in a writers life than that moment when&nbsp;he first&nbsp;slips on wet&nbsp;sentences and becomes inundated with language. I remember ferrying my original copy of LEAVES OF GRASS in&nbsp;the side&nbsp;pocket of my retro brown&nbsp;jacket my Dad had leftover from '78. I remember the color of that&nbsp;autumn, when the world chipped open, when I was in love with a girl who was unavailable and the only way I could manifest my emotions was to&nbsp;sit on my ass, crack open my skull and pour whatever carbonated heart I owned on to the perimeter of the&nbsp;page, whipping my pen, left to right, casting inky-waves into an invisible placid-sand&nbsp;shore I would someday find myself washed up on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Here's the song I have wedged in my brain this morning by my favorite singer-songwriter Greg Brown. It's a song he wrote for Ani DiFranco called VIVID. Enjoy!    Vivid    You gave me flowers, all wet with dew,  You gave me flowers, I'd like to give you something too.   Vivid flowers, raggedy yellow red and blue,  Smell of rain and summer. Vivid, just like you.   You gave me music with the bouquet from your hand,  You gave me a living song, something I could understand.   Let's go walking when the party is through,  You gave me so much, I want to give you something too.

      And you thought my own&nbsp;writing was abysmally&nbsp;bad...this just in compliments of Yahoo news: &nbsp; &nbsp;  Dave Zobel, 42, a Manhattan Beach software development director and author of "Dave Zobel's Bent Book of Boatspeak: How to Sound Like a Sailor and Know Just Enough to Be Dangerous," bested thousands of metaphor-mangling, simile-slaying writers from Hong Kong to Bolivia with this submission:   "She resolved to end the love affair with Ramon tonight ... summarily, like Martha Stewart ripping the sand vein out of a shrimp's tail ... though the term 'love affair' now struck her as a ridiculous euphemism ... not unlike 'sand vein,' which is after all an intestine, not a vein ... and that tarry substance inside certainly isn't sand ... and that brought her back to Ramon."   The competition pays mocking homage to the Victorian author whose 1830 novel "Paul Clifford" opened with this all-too-familiar phrase: "It was a dark and stormy night."   "I never won and wasn't expecting to this year, but to be honest I'm a little jealous of people who won dishonorable mentions because that title would look better on the resume," the father of two told The Associated Press. He won $250.   Runner-up was Pamela Patchet Hamilton, of Beaconsfield, Quebec, who described her style as "Dave Barry with a feminist twist." Patchet, who has written humor essays for The (Montreal) Gazette and other newspapers, impressed judges with this putrid passage:   "The notion that they would no longer be a couple dashed Helen's hopes and scrambled her thoughts not unlike the time her sleeve caught the edge of the open egg carton and the contents hit the floor like fragile things hitting cold tiles, more pitiable because they were the expensive organic brown eggs from free-range chickens, and one of them clearly had double yolks entwined in one sac just the way Helen and Richard used to be," she wrote.   Scott Rice, the San Jose State University professor who started the contest in 1982, said this year's entries were unusually witty. "Sometimes the entrants are more clever than the judges," he said. "Those people generally lose."  &nbsp; ** &nbsp; And to show I'm not being&nbsp;totally biased, here's an excerpt from James Joyce's Ulysses, vastly regarded as the greatest&nbsp;piece of creative exposition offered from&nbsp;the previous Century. Ulysses used to&nbsp;be the most important book I&nbsp;had ever read until I had a prof. intellectually&nbsp;quash&nbsp;my thesis and then use it as his own. He left the University the following year but last thing I heard he's sporting three-piece threads and pontificating nonsense at the World Peace Conference. Here's Ulysses: &nbsp; By what reflections did he, a concious reactor against the void of certitude, justify to himself his sentiments?  The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.   (oh, and the narrator, Leo Bloom, is drunk and is suppose to sport the equivalent of a tenth grade vocab. Like my first agent told me, "It's not what you write, it's how you market yourself...."

      Hemingway wrote every day, perfecting his writing style, following his motto, "All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence you know." Sometimes he wrote in his apartment and sometimes in cafés. He wrote in a letter to his father: "I'm trying in all my stories to get the feeling of the actual life across—not to just depict life—or criticize it—but to actually make it alive. So that when you have read something by me you actually experience the thing. You can't do this without putting in the bad and the ugly as well as what is beautiful. Because if it is all beautiful you can't believe in it. Things aren't that way. It is only by showing both sides—3 dimensions and if possible 4 that you can write the way I want to."

      Nothing&nbsp;beats being panned by the critics!&nbsp;When following your dreams you get sentimentally scorched by&nbsp;lots of overly-groomed seemingly&nbsp;educated Dragons who like to discourage you from creating and producing. Dragons, as Joseph Campbell notes, are people who hoard things, like feeble-wristed&nbsp;PHD candidates:  &nbsp;  "They&nbsp;hoard heaps of golds (books in their office) and beautiful virgins (Their students) and they don't know what to do with either of them. They just hang on."  &nbsp;  Here's a quote from the writer almanac for all my lovers and gypsy dreamers out there about J.D. Salinger and how the incendiary&nbsp;Dragon known as the book critic&nbsp;endeavored to scorch his budding career.  &nbsp;  "Giroux didn't hear back from Salinger for months, and then, one day, Salinger walked into his office. Giroux said, "A tall, sad-looking young man with a long face and deep-set black eyes walked in, saying, 'It's not my stories that should be published first, but the novel I'm working on ... about this kid in New York during the Christmas holidays.'" Giroux said he'd love to publish it, but when it was finished one of his superiors thought the kid in the book seemed too crazy. So Salinger published The Catcher in the Rye with Little, Brown and Company, and it came out on this day in 1951.  &nbsp;  The New York Times ran a review titled "Aw, the World's a Crumby Place" that poked fun at Salinger's style. The New Yorker refused to run any excerpts of the novel, because they said that the children in it were unbelievably intelligent, and the style of the novel was too "showoffy." But despite the mixed reviews, The Catcher in the Rye reached the bestseller list after being in print just two weeks, and it stayed there for more than six months. It has gone on to sell more than sixty million copies. It has been at one time or another the most banned book in America and one of the most assigned books in American classrooms.&nbsp;"  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  In Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Nietzsche utilizes the image of the Dragon as the "ultimate" nemesis from which the ever-fluctuating&nbsp;spirit of mankind must devour if it is to be spiritually transformed.  &nbsp;  According to Nietzsche, the spirit of mankind is always in a state of constant matamorphic flux.  Quick synopsis (very quick)=The spirit of mankind has three stages. The first of that is a camel.  &nbsp;  A camel is an animal&nbsp;carrying substantial&nbsp;loads and burdens. Think of the young wayward artist cultivating his own aesthetic and ideas.&nbsp; Traveling by himself. Working for a goal. Spending hours alone in meditation, intriscally seeking. That's camel work.  &nbsp;  Once the Camel is piled&nbsp;full the camel sets out to the Desert.&nbsp;A desert is a place of spiritual incubation.&nbsp;Numerous Manifestations have at one time or another, been swallowed in the arid sand of the&nbsp;desert. Christ fasted in the desert. The Israelites soaked up a few decades meandering around the desert searching for their collective ethos. Yeah.... the desert is a place, like the womb,&nbsp; demarcated for spiritual growth and change.  &nbsp;  In the desert the camel transforms into a LION. The more loaded the camel, the more aggressive and potent the Lion. "If&nbsp;it wants to capture freedom and be lord in its own desert"&nbsp; Basically,&nbsp;be master of&nbsp;his/her own creativity. That which is latent inside his bones aching to crawl out.  &nbsp;  The Lion has a job, the lions job is to KILL&nbsp;a golden-scaledDragon whose name is THOU SHALT.&nbsp; Dragon's, as previously noted,&nbsp;can be seen as&nbsp;individuals who are "stuck" in a certain&nbsp;spiritual purgatory for so long that&nbsp;their soul's become inflated and their hearts transition into sort've a waiting room.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my profession, the Dragon is the publisher who tells me "Sorry,&nbsp;not what we're looking for" and slips me a bussiness card for a local ad copying agent.&nbsp; But the Dragon is also the&nbsp;hoity-toity&nbsp;prof. who, as Ezra Pound says, "One avg. mind, with one&nbsp;less average thought each&nbsp;year"....basically prof.'s whose only claim to fame is&nbsp;making a carrer forged from&nbsp;footnotes to other people's genius.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  It's stitched&nbsp;in the Dragon's nature to mentally&nbsp;thwart the budding soul of the creative individual in as much that the dreamer will succumb, grow hard cold scales and transition into an inwardly opinionated&nbsp;DRAGON&nbsp;himself.  &nbsp;  Once the LION kills the Dragon the LION transitions into a child. With the child everthing is new and innocent. A child continues to badger out querries. A child continues to always look at the world as if it were a new creation and everything the child touches feels fresh in his grip.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Keep the chin up on &nbsp;your crazy heart and keep slicing&nbsp;apart the Dragon, one delicious scale at a time.   children (smiles)

      As reported on the Writers Almanac today:  It's the birthday of Buckminster Fuller, born in Milton, Massachusetts (1895). He was an inventor, engineer, architect, mathematician, poet and cosmologist; he once said "The only ones who don't get trained for specialization are artists, they want to be whole." He called himself a "Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Scientist" and many of his friends were artists. He said artists "keep the integrity of childhood alive until we reach the bridge between the arts and science. ... Artists frequently conceive of a pattern in their imagination before scientists find it in nature."  In 1927, when he was thirty-two, Fuller was about to throw himself into the freezing water of Lake Michigan. He was bankrupt and jobless with a wife and newborn daughter to support. There on the shore it struck him that his life belonged to the universe, not to himself, and he chose to devote his life to helping humanity. Before his death in 1983, he was awarded twenty-five U.S. patents, wrote twenty-eight books, received forty-seven honorary doctorates and numerous awards, and circled the globe fifty-seven times. His primary interest was shelter and housing, and he is best known for his invention of the geodesic dome.

      Just wish to evince my love and gratitude to the ravishing duo of  LB/MA, the yin and yang of my crazy blogging heart....Much thanks for your presence and your prayers, your dulcet voice and your attentive ears. As I've probably hinted, the last twenty-two months have left me nothing short of physically, emotionally and spiritually exhausted in every facet of my life. The last two weeks I've felt almost totally revived, youthful, and reinvigorated....and yes, even the insomnia that I've always equated as a creative sparkler is starting to wane......

      Here's my favorite Birthday poem by former poet laureate Billy Collins. Enjoy (silly-smiles)     On Turning Ten   The whole idea of it makes me feel like I'm coming down with something, something worse than any stomach ache or the headaches I get from reading in bad light-- a kind of measles of the spirit,  a mumps of the psyche, a disfiguring chicken pox of the soul.  You tell me it is too early to be looking back, but that is because you have forgotten  the perfect simplicity of being one and the beautiful complexity introduced by two. But I can lie on my bed and remember every digit. At four I was an Arabian wizard. I could make myself invisible  by drinking a glass of milk a certain way. At seven I was a soldier, at nine a prince.  But now I am mostly at the window watching the late afternoon light. Back then it never fell so solemnly  against the side of my tree house, and my bicycle never leaned against the garage as it does today, all the dark blue speed drained out of it.  This is the beginning of sadness, I say to myself, as I walk through the universe in my sneakers. It is time to say good-bye to my imaginary friends, time to turn the first big number.  It seems only yesterday I used to believe there was nothing under my skin but light. If you cut me I could shine. But now when I fall upon the sidewalks of life, I skin my knees. I bleed.  --Billy Collins

      It started out with a girl as most things do.   *  The inward historical weight of Linklater's pending sequal and why I can't stop mentally drooling over it.  *  The first time I saw Before Sunrise I was an eighteen year old verbally-effete high school senior who had just returned home from his third eurpoean sojourn in as many years. (A blessing I had slaved for financially, which I would later culturally-contort to promote my own self-worth.) I sported a shock of short-slightly gelled nutmeg hair replete with pennisula sideburns flanking a sly-raffish grin; an innocuous white flag hoisted in the center of my youthful visage. In an effort to salvage culture in in a town, that, I was far too keen to point out to the random pedestrian, obviously wasn't "european", I wore charcoal flavor turtlenecks matched with thickly trussed Velvet Doc Martens. I sometimes sloped a beret over my head in tandem with my heavy Berlin-chic trench coat. I smoked cloves and cigars without knowing how to inhale, I swished boxed burgundy fluid around the inside of my cheeks while prematurely chatting about vintages and years. I supercilously felt like I was already an ordained authority on 'modern' poetry and recited T.S. Eliots "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" incessantly to anyone unfotunate enough to possess an earlobe. "Let us go then you and I/ When the evening is spread out agaisnt the sky/ Like a patient etherized upon a table."   Highschool was one endless elongated blue hallway shepherded by shrilling alarms and social clicks that failed to buckle emotional sanity. My junior year I started scribbling sloppy-inked feeble free-verse in notebooks and by senior year I was obsessed. I scribed only droopy first drafts, penning somewhere between sixty and 100 insufferable angst-laden poems a month. I was arrogant beyond all borders of the definition, all too certain of my destined literary stardom and, rather akin to Eliot's Tarrot identified "fool" in the previously mentioned poem, I remained pompously baffled why my peers had failed to recognize my pending literary sainthood.    It's interesting to note that most writers tend to go through this ugly indulgent ego-nourishing period at some point in their careers. Random readers are of course 'priveldged' to read their purportedly 'deep' yet shallow cannonical metaphores that will inevitably  be archived in the British Museum someday b/c (obviously) everything this so--called self-ordained scribe has in print is obvioulsy the greatest thing in scripted ink since the King James edition. Many writers (such as local pretentious fop's conducting college comp. courses) never seem to slough this superior ego-cloak. (Male writers, I think,  are MUCH, MUCH worse at this 'feigned' pretension than female writers...in my experience that is....perhaps innately, females are better dancers, better movers and tend to be more highly literate early in life)   Joseph Campbell calls this ego-gourged individual a dragon. "Dragon's horde things," Notes Campbell. "They horde heaps of gold (unread books that pile up their offices) and beautiful virgins (their students)...and they don't know what to do with either of them.   I feel fortunate that I gradually flaked off these dragon scales over an eight year time span of simply ugly and bad writing where of course, I cared extremely little about the actual labor of the craft and paid scrupulous amounts of attention to my own Jack Kerouac bad-boy literary lifestyle.      Looking back over my early "poe-whims" (always a snooty dual-syllables)all I can say is that they were plastic lingusitic lego's that I would employ only later to snap the shape of my aesthetic identity.    Okay, no more tangeants. Back to pangs of high school.   Friday nights were spent at my best friends David Hale's abode in Bartonville. His mother would retire early and then the stash of semi-tepid malt liquer would avail itself from hidden panels in the basement. In those days a forty of Ice House or Mickey's circulated a long way being bartered between teenage boys who vociferously boasted in locker-rooms about the longevity of their livers. White-Trash Pat, Hale, Randall and Goth Dan would drop ten-sided dice and verbally illustrate the next move of their level two dwarf while I, of course the  seemingly well-read narcissistic "cultured" one would swig shots in the corner while transpiring meaningless thoughts as they dripped out of my fountain pen.   There was always, of course videos. White-Trash Pat and Hale already possesed a formative heap of permy-haired adult sophisticated visual gumdrops by the age of fifteen. The first "porn" we ever watched together was titled something like Artic Orgy and it was about a group of rather voluptuous polar-nuclear physicits who find themselves stranded in Antartica without any heat and all of a sudden contract a great idea on how to conduct warmth. I went through a lengthy phase where, much to the chagrin of Hale and White-Trash Pat, everything I viewed was endorsed by Merchant-Ivory.  On the night I was trying to explain to them the cultual significane of Remains of the Day the group of sozzled gamers retired early. White Trash Pat and I stayed up and I flipped in Before Sunrise. Though the movie is 100 percent dialougue the flicker of the screen hushed a normally petulant-opinionated Patrick. By the end of the movie, we went outside and hugged each other. It was two in the morning. It was a senior year. When your in high school you advance a decade in knowledge each year. Patrick and I shared a cigartte and then Patrick opened his woodchip lips and paused slightly before commenting:  "Dude, man. That's us."   *   Of course there's more. Of course its about a girl. The girls name is Megan Kristin (I'll omit her last name here in deference towards her own privacy, but for privvy-fingered and omnisicent-eyed Mara-Arya's her maiden name is inserted into the title of this entry and has nothing to do with "osculation")Megan was from the tiny norwegian cheesehead hamlet of Appleton, Wisconsin, of all crazy places to fall in love.  I met Megan about a week after I first saw Linklater's verbal feast and even employed lines from the actual movie on her (smooth-Mistah' V; yeah). The first time we kissed her body squinted like a butterfly in mid-flap before her entire flesh transitioned into spring. Megan could be classified as cuddley and petite (5 ft.2). Her birthday is the first day of spring (Naw Ruz) and with a comfortable six-hours between us we started writing letters. The internet was just starting to wedge it's costipated modemic groan into universal conciousness (e-mail was foreign lexicon and waiting for the damn computer to usher its way into cyberspace seemed to take light-years back then). So Megan and I wrote letters. Huge, inky inky sounvabitches undressed from metered envelopes by itchy fingertips. NOthing beats finding your heart in a mail slot. Her letters were fraught with stickers and hearts; mine were verbose illustrations about everything stuffed with off-metered poems. She'd always smile when she told me that it used to take her forever to read them (smiles).      On October 18th, 1996 (I can still tell you the exact translucent denim sleek autumnnal-blue of the morning sky) I dropped out of my freshman year of college (mainly becasue it was a community college and my parents deemed that there son wasn't worth more than that intellectually) and bought a one way ticket to Appleton, WI of all places, arriving with notebooks and dreams and ambitions. Needless to say my sojourn was terse and our rapport didn't last long. Megan was still in high school her parents seemed rightfully nonplussed by their daughters suitor (although to this day I swear her dad loved it when I referred to him as "Master of the House"). I had written literally symphonies of poems for Megan and read them to her, feeling shunned by the silence of her face afterwards. She was young. I was young. Golden and kalidieoscopic autumn greets the sways and dips of northern Wisconsin in thick strokes of wind gulping down heavily from Canada. I remember seeing Megan through the airplane tint  as I arrived on thew runway and I remember her standing next to me in the terminal as I caught my flight home with tear stained chin and cheeks arriving on the runway to an all too dubious future.  I also remember watching Before Sunrise with Megan in her parents basement. It was the only time during my trip we kissed, however tersely.  When I arrived back home to P-town both my heart and my bank account were empty. I locked myself in my bedroom and plugged-in my father's moribund Macintosh. I spent a week, incessantly, pelting out all the poems I had written for Megan into the computer screen. I revised, I chain smoked like a locomotive, I edited. At the end of a week my tears appeared in front of me and I had a tight fifty pages of verse for my elusive beloved who obviously wanted nothing to do with me. I printed the book up, engendered a calligraphic title POEMS OF LOVE AND ARDOR FOR MEGAN KRISTIN, took the book to Kinko's to have it bound and trussed and then, stuffed the manuscript into a Doc Marten shoe box and burried it into the back of my closet. Where it remained, unopend, for the next 16 months when Megan would re-enter my life at the most inopportune time possible, but I was eternally grateful that she re-entered at all.  I also bought a video edition of Before Sunrise and kept it unopened and stashed in my closet in the bushel of her letters. I finally watched it drunk, on Valentines Day 1997, dialing up Megan's digits, listening to her answer machine, confessinally still too apprensive to plant a message of my own merit.  I didn't watch the video again for a long-time.  *  But this is perhaps what has always allured me to the film. The fact that it was so much like life. The fact that, if ony for a moment, you're embracing this person, your holding that person, this moment in and of itself is an eternity. YOu don't need to ammend a nuptial contract, to procreate, to budget, to age, to grow infertile together. All you need to do is to have that moment. To hold that person and to know that, for as long as we are here, we are immortal.  *  It was late February 1998. I had dropped out of college once again. I was working full time as a supervisor at Barnes & Nobles, my paycheck was monoploized on discounted books and on Jana Solomon, my girlfriend. Jana was a feminine orchard of intelligence and beauty. We had just gone out of town together to Chicago and had rented a hotel room. I loved Jana but never wrote a solitary poem for her.  It was around 11pm and I was sitting in the living room of my parents old house re-reading Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist of a Young Man when the phone warbled its way into social cognizance.   "Is David there?"  Suddenly late winter had transitioned into spring.  *  I was dating Jana and I was in love with Megan. I worked all day, made love to Jana, went home and talked with Megan until 4am. I told her from the outset about my situation. Told her that I was already in love with someone. Told her about taking Jana to the Opera. About taking Jana out of town every weekend. About reading Thomas Pynchon and William Gaddis and David Foster Wallace. I told Megan all about sexual discovery and finding yourself above and below sweating in the pupil of the person inside of you. I told her all of this and then I told her that I never stopped loving her; that I never stopped loving Megan.  *  Earlier that morning, after one of our six-hour conversations, I opened up my closet and sifted through attire and manuscripts until I found the Doc Marten shoebox with the manuscript inside. I went to the Post office and paid an extra ten bucks to have it federally expressed. When Megan opened the manusript two days later she told me that it was opening up her heart and finding her new born, only to realize that the father was out, caressing someone else becasue he had pledged his love to her first while the mother was out finding herself.    * There was about six months of exorbitant four-hundred dollar phone bills. Jana and I would fight and hurtle furniture and end up going at it afterwards. Megan and I would discuss harvesting a family together. I saw Megan just once during those crazy months (another blog indelible details) and still cringe out a cry of nostalgia when I think about Megan's blue skirt and white shawl and the Chicago corner we concecrated with kisses.   There were lies and duplicitous emotions. Megan would tell me that she possibly couldn't consider dating me long term becasue of how I treated Jana, even though Megan herself was the catalyst for most of Jana's anger. The whole situation was just a mess.  *  It ended with Before Sunrise. It was late May and Megan and I were once again talking. I had wrapt up my copy of Before Sunrise to offically sned to Megan as a gift. The casette was tightly wrapt in Renoir Country Dance/City Dance wrapping paper. Jana found and told me that I would never hear fom her again if I continued to my liason.   She then pointed out that she dated a poet who never wrote her a poem.  *  For two years the video remained gift-wrapt, waiting for me to give it to Megan. eventually, I watched it with a girl named Jasna who had, for a while, been to Vienna. I gave it to Jasna after we watched it. She sprinkled smiles across the room.         *  That's the Before Sunrise antcis. In a weird way Megan was there when my dad died and the last time I saw Megan it was in Madison Wisconin, with uncle Mike. I sipped Knob's Creek and she told me about her pending engagement. I walked her out to the mini-van she bought from her dad "for a dollar". We embraced and in my typical fashion I hoisted her in the air and spun her around like a carousel.  "You're always so romantic David." She said to me. "When are you going to learn how just to say goodbye."    The next day I went to Greenlake and saw you-know-who presenting a formidable lecture on mysticism.  *  Even more so ironic was that the date, October 18th, the date I initially abandoned the port in search of my cheesehead bleoved, on that same date, six years later, I officially declared.   *  Life is good. Even if we don't have the girl of our dreams, we still have our dreams and that fifty percent is simply worth dying for.   *****************************************************************

      Since I no longer have access to a writers desk, here's some literary quotes that would have been posted above my old smith-corona on Little 3 x5 inch notecards back in the day.... sorry they look like easter skittles......    "Whatever evolution this or that popular charachter has gone through between book covers, his fate is fixed in our minds, and, similarly, we expect our friends to follow this or that logical or conventional pattern we have fixed for them. Thus   X   will never compose the immortal music that would clash with the second rate symphonies he has accustomed us to.   Y   will never commit murder. Under no circumstances will   Z   ever betray us. We have it all arranged in our minds, and the less we see of a particular person the more satisfying it is to check how obediently he conforms to our notion of him every time we hear of him. Any deviation in the fates we have ordained would strike us as not only anomalous but unethical."      - VLADIMIR NABOKOV,   LOLITA                      "JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW ONE STATE OF AFFAIRS, WITTGENSTEIN ASSERTS, DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN NECESSARILY INFER ANOTHER DIFFERENT STATE OF AFFIARS FROM THEM.  AND YET, THIS IS WHAT WE ALL TRY DOING WHEN WE SPEAK ABOUT THE FUTURE, ISN'T IT?   THE RESULT BEING THAT WE NEVER REALLY KNOW, IF, WHEN WE THROW THE APPLE INTO THE AIR THIS TIME IT WILL COME DOWN.   NOT AT LEAST UNTIL WE SEE IT DROP.   IF, THAT IS, WE ARE ACTUALLY SEEING IT DROP WHEN WE THINK WE ARE ACTUALLY SEEING IT DROP, AND NOT IMAGINING IT, AND NOT BELIEVING IT, AND NOT HOPING.   IF, THAT IS, IT IS AN APPLE.   IF IT IS AIR.   IF WE ARE WE.   NO, WE REALLY DON'T "KNOW" MUCH, IF ANYTHING ABOUT A PLURIVERSE ASWARM WITH LANGUAGE GAMES THAT MUST BE PLAYED OUT AS CERTAINTIES THOUGH THE NEXT SECOND MAY GIVE THEM EACH AND EVERY ONE THE LIE  .....WE'RE ALL CONTINUALLY WAKING UP IN OUR BEDS, A FUNNY FEELING THAT THAT UNEASY DREAM WE JUST HAD WASN'T A DREAM."                   -LANCE OLSEN   , TERMITE ART, OR WALLACE'S WITTGENSTEIN, from THE REVIEW OF CONTEMPORARY   FICTION  ,  YOUNGER WRITERS ISSUE ;   SUMMER 1993

      Here's a little passage from Stephen King's ON WRITING that I've been thinking about today.     For years I dreamed of having the sort of massive oak slab that would dominate a room--no more child's desk in a trailer laundry-closet, no more cramped kneehole in a rented house. In 1981 I got the one I wanted and placed it in the middle of a spacious, skylighted study. For six years I sat behind that desk either drunk or wrecked out of my mind, like a ship's captain in charge of a voyage to nowhere.            A year or two after I sobered up, I got rid of that monstrosity...I got another desk--it's handmade, beautiful, about half the size of the T. Rex desk. I put it in the far west end of the office under the eave... I'm sitting under it now, a fifty-three-year-old man with bad eyes, a gimp leg, and no  hangover.  I'm doing what I know how to do, and as well as I know how to do it. ....            It starts with this: put your desk in the corner, and every time you sit down there to write, remind yourself why it isn't in the middle of the room. Life isn't a support system for art. It's the other way around.

      Uncle Mike gives his nocturnal lecture inside William's cafeteria where I eat breakfast and lunch during the school year. It is the first night of Heartland. Prayers and chants have been said. Students are reminded of curfue. Everyone walks around continually fidgeting with their nametags. When I walk into Williams Hall with Mike, a young kid with auburn hair pulls me over and gives me a hug.  "I remember you from last year." He says, recalling my name.  "Thanks, And-drew," I say, squinting at his nametag.  "I have to ask you something," Andrew nods. "It's personal. I mean, it's really personal."  "Ok," I nod. I'm balancing a stack of books Uncle Mike will reference in his speech.  "There was a girl who said something about you last year. I need to ask you if it's true or not." His pupils widen to the size of manholes.  "Sure," I assent. We are surrounded by bodies. Uncle Mike embraces older Baha'is from Bloomington. The room becomes a carousel of flurry.  "Only I can't ask you here." Andrew says, concentrating very intently.  "Alright," I add "No problem."  * Uncle Mike commences his lecture by informing the audience to be audacious. To take chances. To "preservere", as Shogi Effedni would say. He relays the story about Abdu'l-baha and the cornerstone to the House of Worship in Wilmette.  "Remember what Abdul-Baha said when the cornerstone was christened? "It's already built'."  Heads bob and inwardly sway. There are approximately seven of us. The tops of the heads range from thining to glazed white to hubcap bald. It is ten at night. I'm by far the youngest.  Mike continues melting perfunctory proper speech building icebergs into fluid oratation. He quotes a spam headline scraped from his latest e-mail, encouraging his audience to be intrepid and dauntless; to be fearless in our thinking, to take chances. He encourages us not to be afraid of failure, especially when a movement is intrincially 'youthful' is learning how to walk, autonomously, only all of us are trying to keep precision and balance.  "Remember, amatures built the Ark, professionals built the Titanic."  There are a gaggle of huffed-grins and periodic nods. Uncle Mike's voice is a verbal shine, a buffed avuncular grin with a slight midwestern twang peeled into his resonance. His voice feels like it could be gently stirring autumnal leaves into a dervish scuffle beneath a pumpkin heavy October sunset. Although adavanced in years there is not a scratch of senility itched into his rhetoric. Vivid streams of dialect seem to foam from the side of his mouth. Stories salivate and grace his every smile. Uncle Mike has a gift of making the Baha'i faith simultaneously sound very mystical and extremely practical at the same time. He has a gift of coalescing these two spiritual extremes in his speech-taming them with his benevolent tongue-exhibiting how these two polarities globally mesh, constituting a singular horizon for mankind's intermindable future rather than a question mark positing anxiety culled from a collective species tumultuous past.  There is union threaded in a genetic horseshoe strand of oneness. The bulk of mankind's epistemological pinnings fuse open into a periscopic stem of similarity, sprouting from the soil of every continent.  And there are seven of us huddled around xeroxes and hard-jaundice glower of cafeteria lights, listening to Uncle Mike's parlance, as one listens to the gentle tap of rain. He seems excited and smiles.  Archived photo albums from previous Summer and Winter school lay behind the table where Mike is lecturing. Sporadically a couple saunters by, slow in discourse, pausing to listen at Mike's discussion and alights the album, sifting through each page with a golden pause and gradual smile. Mike warmly acknowledges the alumni's, tossing out his welcome matt smile.  *  "It's something really personal." Andrew says, tugging at my sleeve. I have my "David-we-really-ought-to-start-thinking-about-your-health-in-terms-of-physically-longevity" noctural cup o' jamoke toated in paw. I set down my heap of books and follow Andrew, into the corner, near the old couches where I used to sit and dream with a girl named Melissa months before. Andrew metronomically moves closer to me and squints in my ear.  "Do you smoke pot?" He inquires, with Blakean innocence.  "What," I say, intermittently startled.  "There was a girl here last year who said that the reason you were smiling all the time was because you liked to smoked pot."  I smile.  "No Andrew. I don't smoke pot. I just smile alot. You can say alot with a smile, even if you don't have much to smile about."  A toothy grin arcs into color above Andrews chin.  "I'm sorry. I just thought about that alot since we met last year."  "No problem," I say, turning around, looking for Uncle Mike. Andrew nudges at my sleeve again.  "Remember the handshake you taught me last year?" Andrew says. I smile. I remeber Andrew. He's grown about three feet in the last year.  We perform our 'secret-brother' handshake, pummeling our clenched fists, benignly smashing our knuckels together. I tell him attaboy and tussle his hair, scooping up the mound of Books like a papoose en route to Mike's lecture. When I see Mike and spot the flock of patient-gaited friends stepping gingely into the cafeteria I am completely unaware that Andrew is behind me, stepping into the contours of my flailed shadow, watching my direction, tracing my every step.   *  "When we emblazon His name, we emblazon all the names." Mike says, with warmth and conviviality. Mike has just handed out cheaply collated Xeroxes with trignometric lines. The word ABRAHAM headlines the top of the page like a Title of a syndicated newspaper. Branching off from the word Abraham are three discrete (yet connected at the top) parrellel bars, the names of ABRAHAM'S three wives, SARAH, HAGAR and KATURAH each propagate additional black streams. Sprouting from SARAH there is a little incompleted square that ends with the names MOSES and JESUS respectively. From Hagar (who, along with Katurah, I had never previousy heard of before the lecture) is a long artery stemming down three-fourths of the page. The word MOHAMMAD opens up mightily like a island with wings in the center of the page, only the line continues through Mohmmad, down to almost the bottom of the page, ending in the words 'THE BAB'. On the far branch, the branch that demarcates Abraham's third wife KATURAH, a long, singular black river slices down the far right hand side of the page, shooting straight down like a comet in perfect linearity ending with the word BAHA'U'LLAH. Caterpillared across the bottom of the page lies what my mom might classify as a "verse of scripture." It is Genesis 22:18 :  And in thy seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed.  Uncle Mike continues to discuss religious plurality and spiritual union. He discusses scriptural correlations. He quotes (a la William Sears) a Buddhist adage that heralds the forthcoming Buddha arriving in a time when "metal strikes metal" and then he notes that in 1844, the same day when the Bab declared was also the same day when Morse sent the first telegraph, saying "What hath God wrought?" (Numbers 23:23). Uncle Mike reads the word 'Jesus' in the original aramaic and then reads the name of Baha'u'llah and notes the uncanny similarities.  He does all this while smiling.

      Lavender prayer for two bloggin' buddesses and the rest of turtle Island (Now that I know yer' both alive and well).....only rule...you have to read the poem slow and loud.....    For All.   Ah to be alive on a mid-September morn fording a stream barefoot, pants rolled up, holding boots, pack on, sunshine, ice in the shallows, northern rockies.  Rustle and shimmer of icy creek waters stones turn underfoot, small and hard as toes cold nose dripping singing inside creek music, heart music, smell of sun on gravel.  I pledge allegiance  I pledge allegiance to the soil of Turtle Island, and to the beings who thereon dwell one ecosystem in diversity under the sun With joyful interpenetration for all.  -Gary Snyder

         Nothing beats a little Blog to go along with your breakfast. Got the Beatles on my mind this morning, henceforth the title. My boy Dave McDonald played a formidable set last night at Sullivan's and commenced with a acoustically riveting version of Blackbird:   "Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these broken wings and learn to fly All your life You were only waiting for this moment to arise.  Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these sunken eyes and learn to see All your life  You were only waiting for this moment to be free."    Dave's sort of a cross between a pesky-fisted leprachuan and a gruff chinned, hobo, rail-riding harmonica toting itinerant Bob Dylan. He has a long, cidery Amish beard and sort of talks like Theo Huxtable, i.e., "Right ON!" He writes these fairy tale folk ballads that simply dissects my limbs with evey chord. I was thinking about his song (more of an eight minute tempo-shifting acoustic opus) "Merry-Monday Happen Stance" when my own father was on his death bed. My father's face was sickly sallow--his skin correlating very closely to the offal hue of cheap beer left over from happy hour; his eyes were an even unblinking pools of copper and he my father's mouth was just sort of wedged open like some sort of cancerous lunar crater. Anyway, the moment my father shed his garment their was a scream in the hospital (also ironically, at this particular hospital, everytime a child is born a lullabye is swayed over the intercom...so here we have the entire circle of life represented. My father dying, leaving the corporeal port of life while a child is simultaneously being lifted into the world)...while all this was happening (the initial shock--more than anything else) I had the hard chord's of Dave McDonald's "Merry-Monday Happen Stance" resonating in my head and his gruff sweet-sandpaper monotone to accompany my tears. Thank you, David, for your tunes. Your songs serve as a blanket when I was very cold as well as a breeze when I am very happy and for that I am eternally grateful and will do everything I can to ferry your music (as well as Charlie's...more on him later) to the masses.    -For I proceed I need to apologize to a friend. I said something that I think might have been offensive, so, for what it's worth,(smiles) I'm sorry-          So much loneliness in the world. Met a beautiful girl last night named Jennifer. She was sort've with a cirlce of feminine heyena's having a wicked married girls night out. She kept chewing on ice and when I told her what that signified in terms of askance Freudian logic she just looked at me and smiled. As the night wore on and the crazy carousel of bodies shifted around the room, Jennifer kept talking about how lonely she was in her marriage (something about her husband and a dress) and when I left and gave her a hug and honestly told her that she was beautiful, she told me that no one had told her that for a really long time.    This hurts because growing up things are suppose to work out they way we always envisioned that they would and sometimes when we realize that sometimes, they don't, the loneliness that accompanies this self-realization can be emotionally splintering.   My cousin Amanda, eleven-months older than I am, the relative closest to me in age and probably one of the first five human beings I was introduced to, is going through a divorce right now and it's killing everyone....Amanda's a brilliant human being who graduated high-school ten years ago salutarian, nine months pregnant. Our parents sort of conducted the music at the Lutheran Church where I grew up (when I went to ruhi I would punctuate every memorizing phrase with Luther's infamous "This is most certainly true" bromide and everyone would just sort of look at me like I was weird). Classic case, she was knocked up by the son of a preacher man and the pastor himself fled town after the child was baptized. Amanda got married to a wonderful lad named Spencer in '99 and Amanda is apparently "seeking" now, feeling that the ennui of matrimony is to still-life-with-a-bowl-of-fruit and her husband just looks like he is standing over a dead puppy everytime you see him. There was death in our family a month ago and Spencer served as a pall-bearer, he worre his wedding ring while Amanda...well....     Then there's my friend (other friend-all my friends are named) Dave whose fiance told him a month before the wedding that she likes girls. She was in grad school and Dave was in the process of transfering jobs and everything.    Loneliness. Confusion. Perhaps we live in such an accelerated and marketable commodity-riddled culture that even things that are sancrosanct and important are granted a shelf-life, which hurts.  I heard an interview with novelist Nicholas Sparks, who (even though he writes very simply SUPERFICIAL sentences and portrays human beings like stiff- retail mannequins) wrote a book about a husband who, instead of going of and quote "finding himself" in an affair decides to date his wife again and I can't help but doff my hat to that idea. Sometimes, doing the right thing to do is hard and takes courage....  ....can you tell I kinda struck out with Swissy-Missy? Found out what channel her commercials are on and all I can say is thank god I don't have cable anymore. Oh well, if you're going to strike out, at least strike out swinging (was I at the plate? Was I bunting when I should have hit a sacrifiece fly? Did I only grace the webbed-walls of the batting cage??????)         "You were only waiting for this moment to be free,"      On a more positive note concerning the current state of male-female relationships--my favorite movie of all times..,the movie that is perhaps the only true mediation of love I've ever seen, the movie that is merely a Gen-X talkfest; the movie that, if you've ever been in love and for some reason (space-time-identity)you find yourself unable to be with that person; the movie I first saw my senior year of highschool at 4:30 in the morning and thought about how, afterwards, in four-thousands years, if our planet is nothing more than a gigantic nuclear trash heap where commerce has destroyed culture, somehow, teh counter-archeologists of that time period will dredge up this movie through the battered nuclear detritus and understand the concept of love....the movie Linklaters BEFORE SUNRISE is making a sequel coming out in July!!!!!!  Click here to see what I mean***  http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&id=1808547751&cf=trailer&intl=us  Yap yap yap. I know, that's all I ever do. I'd go home and watch the first Before Sunrise only I gave it as a gift to Swissy-Missy, oh well. What song are you going to whistle when you already know the color of the tune? Oh, how 'bout this one...    "Blackbird fly Blackbird fly Into the light of the dark black night.  Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these broken wings and learn to fly All your life You were only waiting for this moment to arise You were only waiting for this moment to arise You were only waiting for this moment to arise."

      Green thumb my ass! The whole office is slumbering out of their swivel chairs in laughter at my expense. For the last year, I've taken a meticulous interest in watering the potted plants that flank the entrance to the cullom-Davis library. Diligently, for the past two years, I water the plants once in the morning and once very late at night. You don't understand. I love these plants! These plants are so green they could pass for minted currency. I've even gone out of my way to use words like "verdant" and "coniferous green" to describe these plants to craggily old alums with cardboard foreheads and deep pockets. The only problem being (as I just, to my chagrin, discerned in between co-workers cackels) is that the plants are plastic!!! They've been plastic for the whole time I've been watering them and (very Homer Simpson like "D'oh!" here) the carpet beneath the plants also incurred quite a bit of water damage thanks to me being so adamant. Oh well, nothing like slipping on the post-modern banana peel every once in a while.   Of course, me being the sullied romantic sap that I am can't help but corrleate the whole plastic plant incidence into a contorted metaphor about contemporary relationships. How, initially, sometimes, when you meet a person and fall in love and start doing cartwheels on the quad and take an acute interest in every facet of that person's life and the next thing you know, those succulent lips that once compelled you to write sonnets and quit smoking and take up yoga turn out to be...well... plastic.     I'm such a Hick. Been listening to Neil Young and John Michael Montgomery all morning while "gay cleaning" my apartment. The reason I say "Gay clean" is because my last roommate and best friend was very Armani dapper, globally cultured and almost Gatsby-esque impeccable in his perspective on life, i.e. healthy hedonism. We had a sweet apartment in this old mansion now infested with the ubiqutous vraimin known as the yuppie. My old roomy (His name is also David) is about fifteen years older than me and I love him very much but we found out after living together for two weeks that certain strata's of orientations have different calibers when discerning whether or not something is clean. While I often opt for the live in ESPN, open-pizza box motif and had no problem filching the occasional role of toilet paper from my present place of employment, he preferred the apartment look like Covington Gardens at all time and would often, spontaneously, bark at me from the bathroom, asking in his dulcet voice whether or not he was wiping his ass with sandpaper.  Such is the life....Such is life...

      I should've headlined my other blog "Damnitarya" rather than "patiencearya" since I see how addictive this Blogging thing is becoming. I can see it now, five years. My marriage and finances run amok, I'm dressed all in flannel reeking of generic brand cigarettes as I wooble up from my folding chair, a tepid cup of instant coffee tucked in paw, my vision averting to my work boots as I take a deep breath, telling the circled group of internet junkies that yes, my name is David and yes, I am a blogoholic, swatting a teary stain of confession from my cheek as the gruff oval of heads immediately nod in concurrence,welcoming me with a hefty "HI DAVE!".... So I think this is how it will be... I'll blog in the "He who lives in the moment" before I start working (writing) (Ten page daily requisite--which, ever since ******* computer swallowed my Nuclear woods scene I composed on Tuesday-I've been forlorn and sulking ever since!!!!)I'll tackle the pages of the Recital after the day is done and even post crazy poems and dreams and proclivities perhaps on both....  I've been reading, re-reading short stories this pastweek. The best advice I got last semseter was from Prof. Blouch (all you crazy BU students who stumble upon this should take her--Her rubicund pumpkin smile and affable classroom semblance is nothing short of a joy!!!!) She told me that, the only advice she could give me is to "Stick close to the writers I admire and keep thriving" I get equal accolades and certain fingers addressed towards my prose all the time, but that advice really licked my heart like a cheap stamp that was already adhesive to begin with.   ....Which is what I realize about writing and art. The act is reciprocal and it bails you out by the lapels. I cried after I read George Saunders "Sea Oak" and "Civilwarland in Bad Decline". I've probably read both those stories an estimated twenty times, but every time I stumble upon them I enter this pluriverse where I'm both extremely entertained and emotionally sliced open at the same time.  Also, Anthony Doerr's shorty THE HUNTERS WIFE. He was may age when he wrote it and he can do things with language and imagery (not to mention tell a damn good stroy about rustic "Legends of the Fall"-like Montanna that involves mysticim and loneliness) that I can't do. Lorrie Moore's domestic stuff just opens my chest up like a kitchen utensil drawer where all the forks are in the wrong place; and, oh yes (sorry about this Vanessa, if you ever read this--I'm sorry about allota things) David Foster Wallace!!! He has a new book of (sucky and indulgent) short stories called Oblivion coming out later this week, but his first book (a book I keep buying and giving away to other aspiring writers only to find out it is now out of print but will be back in print later this month) BROOM OF THE SYSTEM justr arrive via interlibrary loan and I'm holding it and remembering the first time I read it and thought it was teh greatest thing in print since King James.  Here's a formative interview by Wallace with salon that sort've shaped my aesthetic perspetive about writing!  http://www.salon.com/09/features/wallace1.html  Time to clock on with the book! Maybe next entry I'll avail more about the elusive "patiencearya". Maybe.

      ...my navel was still buckeled into the umbilicus. Shit, I'm sooooo Jar-Jar Binks Maladroit when it comes to modern technology (its the dyslexia, the drines, the stress, the secret-covert crushes on girls who seemingly want nothing to do with you (Swissy-Missy?) the overall sodden poetry of day-in-day out existence, the novels I flick my fingers at the keyboard, the composition of our bodies, the last girl I kissed ( i.e.,see Swissy-Missy above)our long hair forming one giant curtain outside her dorm room, one giant auburn waterfall and how I picked her up afterwards and twirled her into a vortex; a carousel of limbs, only to have her look at me afterwards, her shy eyes bridging out of her tea-cup countenance and simply smile)      so I'm a romantic whoopie-cushion, impecunious dreamer, Baha'i bastard, pack-a-day-poet whittled by overtly exhausted witticisms with chai tea bags under my eyes with enough lint up my ass to knit a Goodwill sweater; but at least I haven't lost it--I can tell you exactly what that sunset looked like at that moment when all the world seemed to be engulfed into the aquatic tinted square....  If you came to this website via Arya Bdiyans, click the grayiosh back-arrow in the top left hand corner and go read her SPIRTUAL Sojourn lectures.  (Shhhh!!!!Arya doesn't know that I'm reading her grandmother's book--so don't tell her...)  This site will be flourishing in a few. I write books and poems and live like a rockstar trying to discern which mountain top the ashram is on, not realizing that the pinncale is already inside each of us....My boss is kicking me out of work. read Arya's stuff. I saw her blogging on the dancefloor and I had to join in...  Gotta motor. I'm goona go stand outside Swissy-Missy mansion tonight with a ukelele a la SAY ANYTHING and strumming the chorus of YEAH YEAH YEAh's "MAPS" bellowing, simply  Wait they don't love you like i love you  PEACE

      Blog bi-day today because of wrangled work ethos. Why is it so cool to deride 'assiduous' workers for sub-menial pay....(I have to due a buncha shit while everyone else in the office bats their eyes at the solitaire screen)Oh well, every ass-hole boss that's ever pillaged my paycheck is fair game when it comes to antagonist fictional charchters...So, all I can say is, ( to my bosses) thank God we live in a society that reads far less than they did ten years ago....this may be you're one shot at fettered-fame.

      My body folded it's limbs into a vivid pocket of sleep last night accompanied by the dream symphony of gypsy angels. Dulcet harmonies hung heavily around my forehead like dole-cratered satellites. My body, still drained from interstate vertigo, floated up and into itself in search of a horse named salvation. In search of a hushed vision anchored in subconcious soil, milked by the quiet stream resonance of light entering stain glass. Was this my reward for leaving and refusing to come back? These staccato hard scratches of light that peel my body in half. The illuminating tiff of interior transcendence? Was this my reward simply for leaving?  *  In the dream Vanessa is standing crossed limb and taller than me as if on stilts and we are having the one conversation that escaped us. Her hair is long and her lips bite into one no-none-shit burgundy hyphen and both of our bodies are facing the polar other.     "What else do you need to know?" She requests. I know all about Jeff. She knows all about Carol. I remember holding her on my tear-swell carpet in my old apartment on Columbia Terrace, listening to the Beatles, watching as the last thirteen months of joy mingled with hurt grazed frustration emptied her body through her sockets. The last time we made love it was almost a human impossibility. Hard lanks of limbs using the other for levitation, and seeminly, succumbing to crumble.  "What happened to us?" Vanessa cries in real-life, five years ago.  "What else do you need to know?" Vanessa asks me last night, in the goassamer foam of dream.  I realize now that I don't know the answer to either query.   *   "It was as if the whole world were a dream, being dreamed by a single dreamer, where all the dream charchters dream too. In India this is known as the Net of Indra." A magnetic digitalized cassette of Jospeh Campbell says in his James Joyce lectures titled Wings of Art, amplified through the lobes of my stereo.  "You go through life. You get this job, you marry this person, you have this experience amd its almost like everything that happens to you has been unplanned. Then you get to about sixty or so and you look back over at the discourse of your life, and, by god, its got the continuity of the novel.  "Schopenhauer asks the question,'Who wrote the book?'"  *      Her voice empties out late at night into the husk of the phone and pours majestically into my ears. The ends of her sentences roll and kick and drool puddles of excitement into my body. I smile. I am exhausted. I tell her that I want to hold her right now. Even though I can't, I tell her I can.  "I went fishin' in my chest last night and got a nibble from an angel."  *  In the dream stream Vanessa and I exchange glances and I am choked up for words. She is looking at me with her uppity glare of importance. Her face is perfectly chiseled with pools of fine-featured hues. She retains her mastery of expresssion; a pensive purloined Waterhouse aura usurped from mythological renderings. She is asking me the question again and I am pulling out of her. My entire body is leaving. My neck periscopes; my body scrunches and Vaneesa inquires again.  "Is there anything else you need to know."   *  "Then you realize that everyone who has influenced you has in someway been influenced by you. So your whole life fuses forth from this intersection" Joseph Campbell comments. I press pause and yank the tape from the mouth of the stereo. I continue to dream.  *   All my life father believed in angels....   *  When she leaves she gives you back the ring that you once gave her. The ring your grandmother gave you for confirmation when you were fourteen. The ring that had your initials, D.V.B., chiseled in cursive font inside. The ring she wore around her neck affixing the oval broach to a pink ribbon.  She has a couple of your shirts still. She asks you for her grandfather's suit--the suit you wore to La Boheme.  You wrap her in the quilt your mother gave you. You kiss without entering her face. You are moving out of everything you have lived inside of--or rather she is moving out of you.  *  "David, is there anything else you need to know?"  *  We laugh about our bloggin'-threesome. We talk about mysticism. I publically confess that if I hear the word 'Mara' used one more time in casual conversation I'm gonna adopt a mutt and address it by that name.  "See," She says. "That's your 'Mara'. You're afraid of embracing it or even acknowledging it."  "But if I had a dog named Mara I could tell it to go fetch. I could tell it to go roll over. I could tell it to go beg. I could tell it to go shit on the groutchy neighbors thoroughly-groomed  rhododendrons."  "Your still ignoring your Mara." She says in a tone that's implicit of 'I'm-the-smartest-girl-in-a-classroom-full-of-dumb-boys' vibes.  "I'm not ignoring it." I say. "I'm just giving my Mara a milk-bone."  "Even if it is your dog." The intelligent girl smiles. "You still have to pet it from time to time. It still comes to you to be fed."    True. I think.  "Touchay!" My palate surrenders.  *  In the dream stream she invocates the question again. She asks me what else I need to know. Everything we ever felt for each other is lying face down in a pool of our own failure and infidelity in front of us. She asks me again. I watch as her body becomes the question mark. I watch as her body becomes the mystery. I watch as her body opens and closes the way a garage door opens and closes--the way a question opens and closes.  "What else do you need to know?" She reiterates. That moment, in my dream, my head conducts a blurry spin like an elementary classroom globe and I see him. I finally see him. I see my dad.  *  "I prayed for my bloggin'-buddies." I tell her. "I prayed for Uncle Mike and Marjein. I said the fire tablet and thought of you. I prayed for the community of scattered souls. I prayed for insight and assistance for those who need it. I recited the long-healing prayer that I love.  I looked up at the doiley-threaded dome and said the greatest name.        "I prayed for peace."  *  "What bothers you so-much about Mara?" She asks.  " I don't know." I answer honestly. "There's a certain realm of dedication where your hobby overtakes you and you become one with that in which you were initially seeking. Get what I'm saying."  Her lips hallucinate verbal tapestry. I continue on with my bull-shit rant.  "With mysticim, especially, we talk about it like we're in a book club sometimes and don't realize that potentially, it could destroy us. We spin around in that dervish-vortex so many times that eventually we no longer have to rely on the slow gravitational tug of the earth and the sun to orchestrate the continuity of the seasons because, from our periphery, its already here. All time and space, eternity in itself has been eclipsed in this moment that last forever."  "That's true with any profession. Any devotion, not just mysticism. You always run the risk of throwing yourself out there and not coming back. The boat seldom makes it back to port without embracing a tempset or two. "  "True." I think and smile.  *    My dream-stream vision has averted from the slender frame of Vanessa and I am chasing my father. I see the back of his gray hair in front of me. We are in a labyrinth of cubicles and I am chasing him. I am shouting out his name and he is almost ignoring me.   He is moving faster. His back is zipping around hard-cornered plastic. The cubicles of the white-collar bussiness office is starting to look like the hard-curves of the human brian. I am trying to reach him. Trying to hold him again. I see his neck and his shoulders hovering in front of me, speeding, vascillating, vanishing, appearing. Vanessa has completely dissipated and I still haven't seen the front of my father's face yet. We are silver-beams streaking around the contours of the universe. I am trying to hold him again. I call out his name and he pretends he doens't know me.  *  In reality-stream I received a card from Glinda, Vanessa's mother when my father died. I called Vanessa up to thank her for the card and she hung up on me.   The next day when I spotted her runway-gait strutting across campus I accost her. She turns the other way and keeps on walking.  *  "When you see Buddha in the middle of the street....."  *  "Dad!"  *  "When you see Mara massaging your emotional mettle..."  *  "Christ was crucified because he said 'I and the father are one.'" Says Joseph Campell after I placed the rectagular magnet back inisde the appliance mouth.  *  I have been chasing the back of my father. Chasing his torso and his thighs. I can smell him. Smell his hair. Smell his body begining to leak drops of perspiration. I see his occiput and his earlobes. I see the back of his glasses. I am chasing him and I am unable to connect.  *  ".....Only connect." Epigram from E.M. Forrester's Howard's End.  *  "...the further one travels, the less one knows."               -Buddhist adage.  *     "And in that second of silence, I heard my mother's voice. And I heard her say something that I had heard many times before: "In times of great danger, say aloud "Ya Baha'u'l-Abha!" So I said it."             -Arya Badiyan  * After I say the greatest name to my father's back he turns around and pauses and I can see his face. He is somewhere else, but right now he is with his son. I am drowned in the nautical fathoms of dream-stream but I can smell his hard skin, can smell his breath and his hair. I can feel his embrace. And I am moved to tears, moved to tears as I blog when I think about that the fact that the one word I said to get him to stop was the one word he said to me, when he did stop and turned around and addressed his only son by saying the greatest name.  *  Was this my reward? Was this my inter-dimesnional tithe? Was he thanking me for saying prayers for him at the HOuse of Worship. Was he thanking his son?  *  " I should warn you," I tell her voice into the phone. "I really don't do well with girls whose first name ends with the letter 'a'.  She pauses  "Damn vowels." I say to myself afterwards, covered in an applause of laughter.  *  (smiles)

      JUST GOT MY MIXED CD!!!!!! THANK YOU DANIELA!!!!   I haven't had a chance to spin it yet but I LOVE London Seude!  I'm off an a crazy adventure. My sister 'Boyfriend' is picking me up in an hour and we're trekking up to Miss Illinois. We're hoping Jenn makes the top ten--with these daffy pageants you never know. Like writing and athletics all you have to do is compete and whatever happens happens.....  Have no clue who Mona is but Blogger Shannon Moore is a local poet (she always beats me in poetry competitions) and a formidable songwriter. She's sorta both of my sisters best friend, but she's been sweet enough to conceal a few of my secrets over the years, which is a dear respite considering the past behavior of fellow family memebers (i.e., 'Blabbermouth Beth')....   Feel free to harnague. I've told Shannon that both Arya and Daniela are mystical divine-eyed creatures in their own accord and she knew exactly what I meant by that.   I'll be gone tomorrow. Mom's letting me borrow her car to motor home so I get to stop at the you-know-where (see recent recital offering) and pray for you-know-who (see-your-own-beautiful-recent-profile-in-nearest-mirrored-frame).......  Gotta go, Lots of love and maybe, when I get back home, I'll tuck you in and tell you and story, a story about a girl who wasn't afraid to dream when she closed the lids of her eyes.......

      Alright. Gonna finish at least one of the recital blogs before I leave work tonight at six. Out to get coffee. Make a sandwhich. If you write alot you use alot. Last semester my zip drive split in half and I lost 18 pages of Literary analysis "stuffy" theory that was due 18 hours later....what did I do. I cursed. I kicked the copier machine. I went out, bought a cup of coffee, diluted it with a few shots of Uncle Jack, stamped out cigarettes and became a locomotive. 17 hours later I finished the assignment and had five pages more than I had started out with.   The teacher was amused......

      Finally got g-mail!!! Thanx arya and co!!!! (wink-wink nod-nod).. Turns out the invitations were sent to my yahoo (smut) bulk account which I seldom check. My new address is: david.vonbehren@gmail.com  I've been ferrying furniture between houses all week which leaves me completely drained. I've also transitioned into a full fledged insomniac. I writhe and seethe and dip into dream vignettes, kick my way out to shore, leave the abode, stalk the streets, smoke cigarettes, ponder and ploy what direction the writing will take...wash up in my sheets of my bedroom hours later, make coffee, go to work, go down on Microsoft word for a few hours, recycle stale metaphores, bitch in my blog, tune my recital, read copious sports commentaries, be shamed by my boss, realize that he's not desperaging me as much as he just needs an outlet to plug his own frustration into and my earlobes come replete with an extension cords and digital sound.  I haven't shaved in five days. Unlike the avg. american male, instead of sprouting a healthy mop on the bottom of my chin when the blade on my razor declares dullness, my facial follicles form abandon minor league ballpark patches...tiny little vortexy nests spattered randomly across my countenance granting me the disheveled semblance of a middle-aged academic still cranking out his botched senior thesis on flannel and funnel-cakes.       Had a patron who was Al Gore's 2000 speech writer talk me up for an hour this morning about how she plans on overthrowing the republican party. She seemed really lonely and carping about politics brought a glean to her eye. Politics like religion fascinates me. Everytime I hear someone talk about their political/religious proclivity....the same thing always happens. I find out less and less about that person's particular notion of "God" or the "President" is and more and more about what that person values as an individual currently are. Happens almost everytime.......

      Writing block-long-blogs that will be posted in the recital sometime shortly. A pending blog called 'Indigo Worship' details my first sojourn to the House of Worship (second one is this comin' weekend)...wish I could spill out words with more efficacy.....oh well, I told my boss that I planned on resigning from my librarian post in pursuits of joining the NBA draft tonight.  "Yeah, Sam. I think I have a shot of being drafted in the 79th or 80th round."  "You doof, There's only two rounds."   "I know but I hired Don King as an agent. He thinks I have promise. He thinks I have finesse. He thinks my long-hair will get me shoe endorsements.  Oh well, nothing like reverting back to the library when all other dreams fizzle out like stale soda.......

      The coolest thing about my little sis' Jenn doing Miss Illinois is that if she wins, not only does she get to go to Miss America but she also gets a brand new car to ferry her royal rump around the state for palatial engagements which means, by degree of sibling default, I get Jenn's 1989 Buick Lesabre which runs like a stag and only has 90,000 miles on it!!! No more hoofing everywhere.   My station wagon 'shed the mechanical garment' shortly after I moved in with Uncle Mike and in a way I kinda miss it (even though the rearview mirror wouldn't stick to the windshield--so it just swayed back and forth like a fresh suicide when I was wobbling down the interstate)....Not having a car can be a blessing. Insurance is a bitch for one. Gas is riddiculous. Plus every time I get a new set of wheels all I ever do is drive around the countryside to unwind. I love hilly-country backroads and (thank you Vanessa and Margot) have a HUGE 'Little Women' predilection when it comes to dating. Something about meeting very intelligent females in remote little country towns where Casey's gas station serves as the social hub makes me feel like I'm dating Louisa May Alcott. Plus there's nothing like driving around with someone whom you love and chasing the sleek-purple chinese-kite tendrils of the sunset. Nothing beats that feeling. Thermos of coffee, lavender jet stream sunset, killer tune on the radio, and of course, a beautiful girl to hold beneath that blanket when the stars dot their smile across the noctural sheet.  Few crickets orchestrating in the background. Slight breeze zipping in the sidewindow. The scent of Summer in America. And of course, eddie vedder ululating "untitled" in the background:   I got a car, I got some gas oh let's get out of here get out of here fast ooh everyone's confused so I stay in my room if I go, I don't want to go alone  I hope you get this message oh you're not home I could be there in  ten minutes or so ooh I got my things we'll make it up as we go along oh with you I could never be alone never be alone   So there we have it. Sibling default. Jenn win so I can get that car and find that girl.   Beth started doing pageants back in 2000. We all thought it was really chessey but she's raked in a ton of cash. It went to her head the first couple of years. I think she sat on her scepter because every time she opened her mouth she sounded like a stuck-up drag Queen. Oh well, she got a free ride into law school. She's a hard worker  ( i still hate looking at my sisters in swimsuits, though....)  Also, how cool is this, since I'll be in Chicago Saturday night, I get to attend my first House of Worship devotions Sunday Morning!!!! Totally cool!! Plus I get to stop and see my best-friend John. John and I have a weird connection. Our birthday's are both July sixth (although I'm five years older), our mothers are both named Linda (I always flirt with his mom--she's single and hot and that aggrieves him to no end) we both wore thick glasses that looked like old television sets growing up and we're both major sports nreds!!!!!   Johns cool! We worked the late-night 11pm to 3 am shift at the library together. We even had a mock-radio type-of-show called the DAVE and JOHN show where it was always Happy Hour even when everyone else is asleep. Lots of crazy humor! Next to writing childrens books and compelling young minds to adopt a life in the arts, I think humor writing is important-more important than stuffy 'literary' stuff. We take our lives too seriously sometimes. We take our professions too seriously. John reminds me of this.The funniest thing he ever did was to fart in the PA system during finals. His flatulence echoed throughout the thick shelves of the library, and Barb, my 72 year old sweet-as-can be co-worker, thought it was her and excused herself!  Ok, no more pull-my-finger flatulence. Beautiful ladies and no-name eunuch's present.    Narrative interruption  (Shit!!!  My Boss just came back and we had to fill out an 'incidence report' form concerning the previous-blogs theft. He seemed just a tad pissed that I abandoned my post even though I got the license plate number. "Don't be Captain America," is what he said.  EXCUSE ME!!!   The patron who was robbed was so thrilled she nearly gave me a gratitude hickie on the spot! My Boss is new and he's trying to impress people (he's also bald and his name is Skip--you know what they say, 'Everybody loves a bald man named Skippy!"--and where was my boss when all this dramam was transpiring? He was out to lunch!!!  I hate corperate america! Funny-you get an MBA and you go back into the crib and incessantly whine about not having the latest 'toy'-- although you're wearing a bussiness suit and hiding your dreams in a coach briefcase.  Oh well. Corporate American intigates professional loneliness on a capitalist caliber and that's where art comes in. Even if it's a CEO who buys a motorcycle becasue he just read "ZEn and the art of Motorcycle maintenace" or the latest Vice President taking an interest in contemporary art and sounding 'snobby' about it at cocktail parties. Secretly, the CEO yearns for such freedom and you know what, you can't have it (SKIP, and every other boss I've ever had) You've already sold out.  I'm so pissed I could just fart in the PA system. Maybe that will deflate the tangible rifts hanging like musical whole notes around here.

      Patron in the library just got robbed. It was amazing. (I just filled out the Police description so here goes)--tall lanky scum-dressed African American wearing a red cap holding down his unkempt and nappy hair. He wore thick glasses. He used a little girl (five years old maybe) as his accomplice. Sat down with her at the computer and frisked a patrons purse. The patron later looked for her purse and found that it was zipped open. She accosted him. He looked confused. Picked up the little girl and handed the patron a twenty. Patron comes up to me and I run after the guy. Caught up with him just as he ducked in his car. He hid beneath the dashboard and then drove off, still squatting beneath the dashboard....oh well, I should have tackled him (then you would have gotton ripped...still, you could have tackled him and taken out your aggression...it would have been fun)oh well, got his license plate number Illinois 525 5510.   Your ass is mine!!!!

      When all else fails, fart, and don't take yourself too seriously. I had just finished typing out the first paragraph of a short story I was going to post on RECITAL called "Ghost Petals from Chechnya", (cool name, i know, nothing like spankin' ye olde ego before loggin off of ye olde bloge) sort of sensual and autobiographical or whatever and the next thing you know, loveable Brian (who sort've looks like a bespectable Winne the Pooh who somehow found a box of marlboro Lights in the bottom of the jar o' honey)turned my computer off for no inexplicable reason! The lab closes in an hour and he shuts down half of the computers early. He turned down the computers flanking both of my sides and then, just like he was pressing a dead-tooth elevator button--click.  "Brian."  "Oh, man, shit Dave...I'm really sorry. I just sort of zoned out."  LESSON IN SYNCHRONCITY  Shit, shower and synchronicity, that's my new mantra. Earlier today I was still reading about boy-to-man psychology and I came across the problem of ego. I'm re-reading a book called KING, WARRIOR, MAGICIAN, LOVER--a jungian sort've glance at the four mature types of masculine archtype. They correlate classic tales to contemporary persona's--for example you can say that Uncle Mike's the magician, Daniela's the princess, arya's the gypsy, and David's the youngin' with a bad haircut who needs to start making a more consious effort to save his fledgling short stories to disk before his red-eyed co-workers inadvertantly cut the power again.  Anyway, I was reading a chapter detailing the classic 'Trixter' charchter. This chapter correlates the trixter to the medieval jester. the court jesters job was to jounce on top of the Kings ego. At royal banquets the KING would get showered with courtly accolades and his ego would augment and the next thing you know, the jester would jump on the table, avail his 'arse' and fart.  Deflation of the ego. Detachment. It actually didn't bother me that I lost this story (it was due for a class in twelve-minutes or anything)..but I think brian serves as a contemporary stale-breath jester when he bent over my computer and farted the screen into darkness. I was seminally exited that I finally came up with a 'smooth' title and the next thing...  Nothing like a lil' detachment. Daniela, there's how many miles between our modems?  Ahhhh...nothing beats a lil' syncronicity........

      ...and looses 35 brain cells. No wonder I have trouble remembering her name afterwards (smiles). No but seriously, I've been reading alot about what jungians call 'mature masculine archtype' (that's pronounced ark-types, as I was corrected after I gave a psycho-analytical speech last winter)--this is reminiscent of the "Childman weary manchild in the womb" stream of thought. How does a boy transition into a man? Although I know I'll get dot-com mara-lambasted for scribing this,the woman, the essence of femininity serves as a harbinger of nature channeling the mystery of life. She is muse; she is both alpha and omega. Kingdom Come and the Life Everlasting rests solely on the position of her ankles and thighs in relationship to the perpetuity and genetic continuity of her species. I'm not saying that a woman's function is an incubator (not really saying anything as much as stuttering over footnotes and raked thoughts)I'm just saying that she's a vessel of humanity.  By the time a female has her first menstruation life over takes her. She has made the transition from girl to woman.    This is intriguing when you consider the metaphorical notion of the womb. The womb is metaphorically a place of spiritual incubation. It has been suggested that the cave paintings of Lascaux and Les Tres Freres (caves that were implemented in boy-to-man rituals) were suppose to be emblematic of the womb--a rebirth so to speak. The young warrior slides through a narrow tenebrous plume (the birth canal) enters mother earth fraught with cave paintings and incense and animal skins. The burgeoning man meditates, fasts, incubates, allows his spiritual limbs to cultivate before he releases himself from the 'womb' realm, sluicing out through the narrow canal, re-entering the planet 'born-again' so to speak.  Hell, even Christianity utilizes this womb theory to administer their message of gulit mingled with a shot of sporadic forgiveness. Look at the architecture of a church. The center aisle becomes emblematic of the birth canal and the front of the church is the 'womb'--a place where the sacrement is offered. Where the baptismal fount is located. The congregation exits the church 'reborn'---is there any wonder that gothic cathedrals dotting the european countryside are called Notre Dame or "OUR MOTHER"?   Where the female arguably becomes life, the boy has to choose to become a man (purportedly).  "The boy has to act," is what jaded fairy-tale huggin' jungians suggest. They point to male rituals evident throughout humanity's discourse where the boy leaves the tribe, searches, nurses a vision, sloughs his old belief system like a snake skin.  Is this making any sense? Personally, I like to believe that, regardless of gender, both sexes have to 'act'--spend time knocking and digging, exert energy finding out what they are capable of achieving as human being verses their four-legged mammalian counterparts.   Sometimes I think the notion of intelligence is completely arbitrary when it comes to mammals. I could teach a well-trained monkey how to punch keys on Microsoft word. I could show him the pattern for a hiaku. I could teach him how to wipe his ass or how to sign out his gratitude. But still, human beings come to the notion of what does it mean to feel, what does it mean to overcome? What does it mean to Love? What does it mean to have a 'vision' and to feed that vision with splashes creative-fuel.  Jungian archtypes are cool but they've almost become posh. Hell, mysticism has become posh. It's no longer about suffering and yearning and eternal-longing as much as it is about sounding erudite and well-read at a campus dinner party and hoping to get laid afterwards. I read the greek etymology of 'mysticism' over the weekend and it stems from a word that means 'silence', 'secrets'...the early greek mystics knew something and they weren't gonna promulgate it or market it. Although, for a wayfarer or for someone searching they'd assent their chin and smile when they saw that they had embarked on their own personal sojorn.  Reverting back to masculine psychology...there's a well-known book by poet Robert Bly called IRON JOHN: A Book about Men (it's the yang to Woman who run with Wolves yin)....Bly alchemically dissects a grim's fairy tale 'Iron Hans'..it's really beautiful in a way. I'm familiar with the story and have owned the book many times (like all the books I love, I keep giving them away) every time I read it I get to the point of the story where I'm at psychologically and then...still-life with a dictionary, I can't move. Maybe someday I'll be able to finish the book, but perhaps that's what the author wants..."it's cool to read books and sound intelligent, much harder to live a life and experience and not share it because your their......get what I'm saying?  Just random speculations and irritating errata.  I do have one special place of spirtual incubation. Mattheison state park, outside of Starved Rock--it's my 'vagina' so to speak. It's place where I go to and let my hair down and run wild. A wet, moist, leafy, autumnal place with lavender sunsets and wheatfields and steep dells foaming with Waterfalls (an Illinois anomaly) with the beautiful vermillion river brushing through nearby. Once my booksies start selling I'm gonna build a thick log-cabin up near there so you girls (arya/daniela/ and the 'other' ex-girlfriend that is stalking me) can come and visit and we'll go on long hikes and I'll show you what my heart looks like as seen through the ontological lenses of mother earth.  I may even dabble a book called "MATTHEISON GRACE"-every time I sweep through then canvas of Mattheison crazy shit happens and I come out 'reborn' awaiting a pending trial in my life.  I blasted up to Mattheison last year and skinny-dipped in the Vermillion (pretending it was the ganges). I looked up on a gravel precipice and saw a cross. Vision? Freak? Hallucination? It was a cross made of wood with thick black letters strewn across the plank. Reaching for my sandals and shorts I began to mount the precipice. As I neared it I saw the word JESUS thickly scribed across the plank followed by (freaky) my own birthday. JULY 6, 2001 (day in which I turned twenty-four and the day President Bush finally turned two). I scrambled up ot the top of the precipice and it turned out that it was a memorial for a spanish boy who had died. His first name was Jesus (hey-zeus) and he was born one year after I was and had died, on the precipice,on my twenty-fourth birthday.   There was a plastic statue of Mother Mary, half-melted from the late september sun. Burnt candals littered around the cross's trunk. For some reason I felt connected to this person. This Jesus. I uttered the prayer for the departed--kissed the bark of the closest tree, took off my sweater (the A&F sweater I purloined from Jenn's wardrobe; the sweater I wore when I first kissed Caroline two three years earlier) and tied it around the tree closest to the cross as a sacrifiece.  Six weeks later I went back to my 'sacred' place. Re-entered my 'vagina'. An early November snow had coated the bleak Illinois landscape.  In early winter the entire state of Illinois turns silver--alchemically it aches for gold. I went back to this secluded palce where I always take off my clothes and bathe (not in the winter) went back to the cross, expecting to find mu double-knotted sweater damp, dirty, infested with bugs. Went back to mount the gravel precipice and to say the prayer for the Deaparted for Jesus. When I reached the summit there was no trace of the cross. There were no candles. No scattered beer cans. NO trace at all and when I went to the tree where I double-knotted my sweater as an offering, it too had completely disappeared.

      Couldn't sleep again last night so I ended up (oh-no) wadding up my long hair in a cumberbun and completely shaving off my sides and scalp so now I look like I'm fourteen, trying to become an insurgent by growing my hair long and going to Ozzfest....yuck.  This is the first time in like ten years I haven't had sideburns (or sides-period). Uncle Mike roused me up into gunky-morning conciousness and of course, I forgot what I did and I'm like emulating Maculy caulkin's torrential cauterwaul when I see myself in the mirror....  "Wake up."  Didn't want to go to the Baha'i center this morning either. I walked in late and of course, lovely caroline shoves a Prayer for Fathers that I am to read (don't like thinking about fathers on F-day) which I smiled and read the best I could. Perhaps its the concourse playing tricks on me...  Good news is I found a huge Blackberry orchard in our backyard. Huge. Like the wicked witch of the West cackling "poppies" although it's bushels of blackberries instead. I went blackberry picking last night and decided, in typical house-husbandry fashion, to don an apron and do some baking.  (alright-no apron, but I'll still bake.)  I LOVE cooking and devising recipes. Love GRILLING!!! I'm going to make a Blackberry pie. Should be fun. I have no talent whatsoever in the kitchen. oh well. True, commensurate talent is reserved for other rooms in the house. I talked with poet Laureate Billy Collins a few months back and his advice was that students and writers should always be a 'sophomore' in some other profession other than writing. A dilletnante. I like that alot....

      Third father's day w/out the father. Love you buddy. You had the most dulcet wife and the most beautiful daughters. Jenny's doing Miss Illinois this year, just like Beth used to do. Can you believe that shit? Beth got married last summer. I couldn't ask for a better brother-in-Law. Dan's a great guy. He just completed his medical boards and Beth has one more year left of Law school at Kent. They refurbished a beautiful house in a tiny town called Harvard...you'd be proud.    I was an usher at Beth's Wedding. Always the bridesmaid never the...usher. I'm sick of always being a fucking usher and asking pointless query's. You know, "bride or groom", "straight or gay" "inner or outtie". Uncle Larry walked Beth down the aisle. She was stunning, an immaculate white sheet bearing veiled wings. It was the first time the whole family was together since the funeral...  ...You wouldn't have beleived you own funeral dad. Davidson-Fulton said it was the largest Wake they ever had. You would have been embarrased at the number of people who showed up. There was at one time, a two hour wait for people to pay their respects. Police had to be called in to marshal the traffic on Garfield. We received so many cards and hugs from former students. Our living room turned into a greenhouse. And of course, the best part about funerals is always the meat trays everyone drops by.    The funeral itself was overwhelming. Jim Van Buren gave a eulogy (everyone laughed when he told stories about how you used to court mom and your romantic foibles), Jenny gave a brilliant testimony and Doctor Bob's serman was soothing. The funeral procession was amazing. There was about three miles of cars with their lights on en route to the cemetary. You wouldn't have believed it, Dad.     I'm still writing. I was working two jobs; working too much but now I'm back at the library (no Greeley!)and even went back to school last semester full time and made the honor role. My writings getting better too. Stories still wierd but at least they're more coherent and I'm not as pretentious as I was when I was in high school.  Your wife's doing good. She's hanging in there. She renovated the house and now there's all hardwood floors and even a marble fireplace. Mom and I didn't talk for awhile, but I think gradually we're rectifying our relationship.  Need to tie this up, buddy (fucking grieving...writing this at work and tears are welling)...anyway, you died so suddenly that I just wanted to tell you how proud I was of you. You were a man virtues and of chrachter. You loved for wife very dearly and you did what you could for you family and even though we had our rifts, I love you and still pray for you. I don't think I'll ever have a family (unless my books are my kids...shit...they give me enough hell, that's for sure)but if I do, father, if become half-the man that you were, I'd consider myself a success.  You're my hero, buddy.......     Love you dad

      ...or cafight. "YOW". Talk about being pummeled and bashed with  blogs. The last day unveield the purported masked identities of  beautiful-eyed daniela and myself plus re-affirmed common universal knowledge that yes indeed (duh) arya badiyan is omniscient and ravishing and david likes to publically whine and bullshit and devise strategems to make him sound more intelligent than he actually is (ibid. see the inane READERS PRIVACY ACT of '04)....  Anyway, thought I'd take a hiatus, a sabbatical, place my blogging dreams on the back-burner. Surf the internet. Try to explain to other net-voyeurs that there our very complicated, altruistic and aesthetic reasons why I frequent certain web-sites (smiles).   Uncle Mike and I are in the process of moving to a huge house with lots of land and a swimming pool. I'm learning how to do all sorts of 'domesticated' stuff (a tractor lawn mower!!! spraying the basement for bugs!!! fertilzing the huge garden!!!) I feel like I'm in my mid-forties and my hair is going bald as I lumber around the aisles of lowes or menards with all the other, "house-husbands" searching for mulch, comparing different shades of paint, looking for a new door knob. Ahhhh...the pangs and perils of house-husbandry.

      Been riddled with insomnia all week. I shower, I lay down, deluged by thoughts, neon embryonic vignettes wafting and hovering above my head like it is always the fourth of July and my scalp is Ellis Island. I ferry back and forth between the kitchen chugging shots of Britta water. I check on Uncle Mike lying in front of a boxed whizz of static blue. I channel surf, drooling over infomercials featuring spandex-clad lasses inserting their limbs in contorted yogi positions while smiling. I sweat. I shower again. I go on long nocturnal jaunts and smoke cigars. I got called over by a bunch of denim-skirted sirens last night playing EDWARD 40hands. They had two forties of king-Cobra Malt cheap liquer that looks like stale Clysdale piss ducktaped around each palm. I continue to walk. My ex-girlfriend teaches art and lives on Moss Avenue. We didn't date long and we still have a mutual respect for each other. I get inspired when I see her up, at three in the morning, through the sallow dim-lit square of her apartment watching her splatter paint on the canvas...    Last night I found my novel BOOK OF MUSES (BLOCK OF MESSES) and went through it. It's sloppy and large. Parts of it are pretty steamy that I'd get kicked out of the sauna if I'd read it in public.

      ...although I feel like I'm twelve, my vocie is scratchy and an octave lower than a year before, my face is oily and patches of hair have begun to harvest wheatfields across my lower abdomen and beneath the socket of my arms.   My friend Shannon just left.   "Tori Amos is forty. Eddie Vedder is forty. Courtney Love is forty." She huffed.   ...and I feel like I'm twelve, going on a tour of a highschool with hallways that smell like chlorine and disenfectant and girls with side-ponytail holders wearing their boyfriends lettered-varsity jacktes who smell like they have just showered and used conditioner and life is brand new....  work is arduous. check back periodically at the recital for long pending stories. and oh...mara-arya...say chesse... your gonna need more than the devil to chase satan outta that shot(smiles--just kidding, you we're bloggin' buds-gotta give you a hard time)

      Even GOOGLE is acknowledging BLOOMSDAY today!!!!!   BLOOMSDAY is the day when James Joyce's (BEAUTIFUL, DIDACTIC, SNOBBISH, INDULGENT) novel Ulysses takes place on. Dublin, June 16th, 1904. You know, who can possibly forget chapter three, Stephen Dedalus's solitary stroll along Sandymount Strand, "Ineluctable modality of the Visible, at least that if not more. Thought seen through my eyes. Signature of all things, I am here to read..." or Leopold Blooms sozzled cogitations as he stumbles home from the brothel, helping Stephen urinate. "The pre-ordained frangibility of the hymen. The pre-ordained frangibility of the thing-in-itself in id." Or Molly Blooms sixty page single-sentence fragment that transitions into lotus shaped orgasm, "Yes I will, Yes, YES, YES!!!!!"  The book was initially banned and rightfully so becasue it doesn't make much sense. It is considered by many to be the greatest work of quote 'literary fiction' ever conceived. It is difficult and abstract even for scholars, let alone the average reader to discern. For a long time, especially in my early-twenties, James Joyce was heroin and I was a junky licking my needle in anticipation of his linguistic high. I wanted to know everything about James Joyce and to prick his antics into my flesh. I figured that if I could harness Joyce's aesthetic and master his literary parlance (not too mention he's pretentious as all get-up)I would be a great writer myself.  For a long time almost everything I spat out of my literary digestive system was merely ego driven. I made the mistake that almost all naive young writers make--I didn't want to have the burning desire to write as much as I longed to be a conspicuous writer.  I wanted to carp and be a critic and assent my clefted-snobbish chin up the snobbish realms of literary pedagogy; to write maybe one or two 'scholarly-shoveled' books deemed 'literature' in my lifetime, crack open the Western cannon, wedge my flatulant prose inside it, be immortalized on a Barnes and Noble montage smoking cigarettes, have one of my own epitaphs chiseled into the marble neck of my tombstone.        I tackled and re-tackled all nine hundred erudite pages of ULYSEES (not to mention Finnegans WAKE---UCK). I wrote conceited-fictional vignettes inked in Joycean physique. I wore berets, considered myself important, used 'ugly' voabulary words in public to sound overtly intelligent. I made HUGE deals about literary theories and brushed-shoulders with semantic scholars.  I wrote stream-of-conscious Kerouac novels where single run-on sentences streamed into waterfall paragraphs that bubbled into pages upon pages of drivel and doggerel. I hurt people. I fell under the class of writers that I used to admire (David Foster Wallace, James Joyce, William Gaddis, Thomas Pynchon) that I now diagnose as having the 'SHREK' factor---their noevls are so big and so lingusitically tortuous that they are obviously TRYING TO COMPENSATE FOR SOMETHING. 'Member mama bear warned you about dating guys with big vocabularies....      I was sick.           The summer of '98 was the summer I was going to master James Joyce. I spent over $600 on elucidatory texts for Ulysses. I had the Gilbert notes, the Gifford notes. I had slides of Dublin. I had annoted drafts of Joyce's epic cached in my own writers desk. I had six-hours of Joseph Campbell lecturing on James Joyce (these would later save me. Joyce was kinda Campbell's hero. Campbell sort've helped me out--more later)....  I was alot like that person you probably had teaching your ENG 101 class who publically corrected your grammar and enjoyed making a mockery of your ideas.  Here's what I've learned. Language works when you give. When you sit on your ass and your ego everyday and (for all you other aspiring writers out there)when you care more about the person you are writing for than you do for your own writing itself.  When you care more about what that beautiful, faceless, (danielaesque) creature thinks than what you think--when you care enough to give enough. You have to hold a rapport with the reader, almost like a commercial pilot...I'll take you to that place you always wanted to be. I'll entertain you, I'll help you grow along the way. I'll give you everything inside my chest so that someday you can give everything inside of your chest for soemthing you believe in...that sort've thing.  But I've ranted long enough.

      Feel just like Kid Rock when I bellow DEEEE-TROIT's in 'Da HOUSE!!!!!!!!  Let's hear it for the Detroit Pistons whose IMPECCABLE defense dipped with their offesnive swagger propelled them to the biggest upset in recent sports history!!!!  This was simply a case of no-name Underdogs (Wallace, Prince Billups, Hamilton) vs. EGO (SHAQ, Kobe, Father Malone, Trash-talkin' Payton)....  It was modesty over Money, ethics over ego, team harmony over team histrionics, fundamentals over fear...  ..it was beautiful.  Anyone who has a vision, "A vision boy, A 'Damn' VISION" (QUOTE Ginsberg to Kerouac)  knows what its like to be an underdog. Knows what it's like to have people look at you and scratch their chins in bewilderment while they privately confer that "they'll never make it."  Maybe it's because my first name's David (Lots of words loaded in that sling I've been 'a brandishing) or because my father's favorite movie of all time was ROCKY, but there's something beautiful in actuating your dreams. Soemthing beautiful in assiduosly breaking a sweat everyday, something beautiful and compelling in LIVING THE LIFE YOU FEEL MEANT TO LEAD and doing what you feel BLESSED to do. Something, simply, beautiful in overcoming.....  Now, if you'll excuse me, allow me to verbally distribute my pent-up elation for Detroit.  "That'sallI'msayingyo!!! That'sallI'msayingyo!!!! That's ALL I'm saying yo!!!"  My Boys!!!!!!!

      Just got into work and brushed up on fellow blogs.It's raining sheets of static precipitation outside and I got soaked trying to circumnavigate around Noah's zoo while walking en route to the library. I really want to read this morning--I love reading when it rains outside-- but, duh, I  left my satchel back at the crib. Work is tedious. We just got a new librarian and half of my summer hours have been axed. (!) In dire need of ingetsing copious amounts of caffeine in order to keep my eyelids from flapping south.   Cubs won big time last night! I think my boys in Detroit could win it tonight. I know, nothing like climaxing about sports when you're engaged in a "trialougue" with two beautiful women. I'm actually a basketball-freak. "H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A/ shizzle on my nizzle used to dribble down in VA " Something like that. I tutor Bradley Braves basketball players during the school year. "Jabbar, head out of your ass and in the books brother." Beautiful giants. They limp around campus as if they just got shot in their achilles and when they see me they shout out my first name and give me a long complicated gangsta handshake and make me feel like I'm part of the team. It's really special in a way.  I used to teach english at an Alternative junior high and High school. (Alternative meaning the kids were expelled from the district or had pending court cases) It was the worst job ever. I got paid shit and got cussed out and hit every hour and once--right after my father's death, a 17 year old 250 pound seventh grader named Marcus with leather thick skin and John Henry bones fell off his desk and broke my leg. Real funny, only problem was that the hospital--the same hospital where my dad capitulated his earthly rug only two weeks before--took x-rays and misdiagnosed it as gout(?)  So for ten days I'm limping around the hallways thinking I have gout, walking with this cane. When I did finally get a valid diagnosis and got a cast my students drew gang signs and vulgarities on the side of my leg and Sherita, my precocious little angel, even wrote me a Valentine stating that, "Muster V.B., you is so ugly." Even when I'm crippled she refuses to write proper english.  Teaching was sometimes fun though. I'd always get in trouble with the district for doing crazy things. They got pissed off because I was using rap lyrics to teach the parts of speech. "Circle the conjunctions, Snoop....With my mind on my money and my money on my mind." Oh well, the kids learned for once. One time a student called me a "Snow-Cone-head-camel-breath-looking-mug" and I made the entire class compose short-stories where the antagonist was a "snow-cone-head-camel-breath-looking-mug" ahhh...teaching is such an arduous profession.       Kids are crazy. I was walking home from the library just last week when one of my former students (she's in 8th grade now) flagged me down. She was driving a car and she was only 13!!!!  "Use needs a ride, Mistuh Vee-Bee?"  "Trina what the hell you doing driving a car?" I said.  "Picking mies mom up fromsuh work. I can give use a ride if use like."  Kids.   *

      Divine irony or knee-clattering embarrassment? I just found cute Jenny-from-down-the-hall's VICTORIA SECRET catalougue mis-placed in my mail slot this morning. So now, what do I do?   "Yes, this is yours, I haven't read it or drooled over it or anything (don't think about page 32! don't think about page 32!)." She already thinks I'm kinda weird always walkin' around with a heap of books and Uncle Mike. Now I suppose I've just graduated from Weirdo to Pervo.   *  Family rifts run blood deep. I really love my family and wish I could rectify many of the mistakes and foibles I have made in the past in regards to my siblings. It's kind of sad in a way. The last thing I asked my Father before he died was for $150 so I could pay off the laptop I bought on the black market which had over 500 pages of my book on it and I'm still pissed about that. My sister had their own pricy instruments to serve as creative mediums and I didn't need a token of love as much as I longed for a ring-manager. Someone to slap my ass occasionally on my way back to the dugout and say, "Good job" even when I just struck out. Even when I swung the bat as hard as I fucking could and just couldn't make contact with the curve ball life hurtled at me from the mound. Sometimes I think that the job of a parent (maybe even the job of a god) is just to show belief in the creature you created, regardless of the creatures innate flaws.      Not that I totally blame my parents as much as I blame coifed or "contemporary" Christianity where the yin/yang of our collective subconious is filtered from the authorative din of the pulpit to the naive earlobes of the pews as HEAVEN/HELL, RIGHTEOUSNESS/EVIL HOLY/SINNER. My parents were both heavily schooled in the nazi-conservative James Dobson Focus on the Family cadre and to this day, I wonder how many lives--how many families-- James Dobson himself has marred? I'd be willing to bet my lifeworks that its somewhere in the tens of thousands. If he likes Jesus so much he should nail his own askance belief-system on a few wooden-vertical helixed planks so he can see just how UNFOUNDED his purported scriptural based belief system is and the psychological havoc it has spawned on young kids.  Brilliant and burgeoning Young Minds.  The problem being firsthand is that, when a parent neglects to feed the child, the child learns how to hunt for food himself and will sometimes put things inside of his body for imminent nourishment that are not healthy.   Example: the last four years I've been seeing alot of older women. The avg. age would be somewhere between 38-42. Some were classy scholars, some bar whores. Mostly I have learned that sadness and lonliness is pretty much universal and that if your looking for longterm contentment between the thighs of another its very doubtful that you'll ever find it (although, being a lover, you strive to find this union, and harbor some sentiment of optismism that it exists--its what fueled you into a life of the arts in the first place...)   Anyway, I realized that perhaps the reason I was indulged and fascinated with the older sex was because, perhaps, I was still looking for something that my own mom should've given me. Looking back now (hindsight is ALWAYS 20-20) there were voids that needed to be filled that my parents filled with two sentences.  MOM: You've made bad choices.  DAD (God rest his soul): Do what Jesus wants you to do.        *  Sorry. I wanted to write about my sister but the sting of sentimentality and family histrionics is brick heavy and still very palpable.  It hurts, but let me just say this before I re-cycle (haha-arya and D, 'nother 'cycle' pun) this blog. We, everything we are as human beings, is a sum total of all of our collective experiences reflected from the interior screen marooned in the confines our own skull. Walt Whitman posits this in his hymn " i am part of all of those I meet" Likewise, I think Joseph campbell says it best:  "Life is pain and life is suffering and life is emotional poverty but--Damnit kid, you're alive!!!!"   No matter what season, how high the hill or how abysmally deep the valley we have that inside of us; beckoning us to LIVE THE LIVES WE FEEL LEAD TO LEAD (that's lead-2-leed, phonetically)... and shit, sisters and friends, what a wonderful life it is!!!!!

      Jenn was simply ebullient and graceful last night in Carousel. Her voice swept through the flaps of the tent with all the svelte, sincerity and class of an operatic diva-- a voice capable of sawing open both hearts and tear ducts simultaneously. Her 'autumnal' hair was long and curly in a Lousia May Alcott Little Women sort-of-way. When the spotlight's illuminated cone captured her vibratto the entire audience (including her brother) fell in love. Is that why I left early and cried. Hoofing home, through the park late at night. So proud of her...wishing my father could have seen his daughter. Pissed off that the wound of death hasn't completely scabbed over. Raking up scattered leaves of family remorse sifting inside my chest, wishing I could set the crumply heap ablaze and start new, which of course, will happen over time. Life isn't a unicycle (Thanks arya). Nor is it a motorcycle. Geez; my analogies are so lame and cheesy this morning that even my witticisms are subject to mold....  Anyway, I have two beautiful talented siblings. We're not very close. When I first left home it was my sister Beth who asked me to leave. Told me that's what mom and dad wanted. They didn't want a bum-son lounging around the house stringing compoud sentences together via Microsoft Word. Jenn and Beth were kind of sheperded through the arts under the aegis of my parents. But maybe being a loner sometimes forces you to find yourself--find what you are capable of dreaming and seeing... I used to (many, moons ago little tree) practically breathe under Hesse's adage "The true profession of man is to find his way to himself..." That's true but can be quickly contorted especially when finding yourself is synonymous with Loosing yourself in a spate of vices.   I never would have heard of Uncle Mike or the Baha'i faith ( or arya or daniela or Pearl or Hafai) had I not drooled over Joseph Campbells books and his compelling recorded lecture series for years first. When asked the inevitable query of "What is the meaning of Life" by Bill Moyers in the widely anthologized POWER OF MYTH documentary, Joseph Campbell politely asserted that he didn't think singular "life" possesed any sole meaning.  "Not true." Moyers barked back in acerbic retort.    "I don't believe life has a purpose. Life is a lot of protoplasm with an urge to reproduce and continue in being....sheer life cannot be said to have a purpose, because look at all the different purposes it has all over the place. Each incarnation has a potentiality and the mission of life is to live in that potentiality...."   ( I Love that, 'live in that (your) potentiality'. I remembered the 'protoplasm' part but just dove into the catacombs of the library to retrieve the rest)  Campbell: ......How do you do it? My answer is, 'Follow your bliss.' There's something inside of you that knows your in the center, that know's when you're on the beam or off the beam. And if you get off the beam to earn money, you've lost your life. And if you stay in the center and don't get any money, you still have your bliss.  Moyers: I like the idea that its not the destination that counts, its the journey.  Campbell:Yes. As Karlfried Graf Durckheim says, "When you're on a journey, and the end keeps getting further and further away, then you realize that the real end is the journey."   (Moyers, 229, 230).     A blessing in my own life was coming into the Baha'i faith through this ontology (epistemology? dunno. Ugly philosophical word--you know what I'm saying). I had pretty much jettisoned the whole notion of a supreme Godhead and everything and then, gradually...wow. All of this plus Uncle Mike's mysticism and knowledge kindled with Arya's Odyssey (first Baha'i lecture I attended and still, by far the best) left my spiritual Longing blasting off the mystical launchpad inside my chest.    *    Amazing things are transpiring in the community right now thanks mostly to Mike and Marjean (Beautiful Marjean, she's in her 80's and her face is post-stroke sloped; but she's a beautiful angel)...Keep in mind that our community is older, ego-aged and dwindling. Our feasts are almost always under 10 memebers. Mike and Marjean (along with myself...which really makes people jilt their necks in wonder when they see us together) rented a hall and had a huge Naw RUZ party last March. The whole time I'm plagerzing lines from Doubting Thomas, saying that there's just no way given. Turns out 120 people showed up......      (here's where I just wrote like-5 plus beautiful heartfelt pages about Mike and Marjean, their actions, and even about how Mike found the faith. Low and behold the Computer crashed and and only saved the first part of it.....Think the concourse was involved? There's a story about how all of the Master's miracles were chronicled and Shogi Effendi sent the manuscrupt to be destroyed b/c he didn't want people being attracted to the faith b/c of certain (weird) deeds actuating through spiritual gifts.  FIVE PAGES!!! UNCLE MIKE'S STORY (including seminary...usurped to the Greenpeace recycling den in cyberspace, along with my LOVE POEM TO STACI PERKINS last Spring, my ten pages of the Nucelar woods and my short story I flushed out of my skin in a fit of rage that I'm sure would have won the Nobel.....  .....ahhh, nothing beats lessons in detachment  Arya and Daniela rule. Everyone else who reads this log on a daily baisis and refuses to comment will be riddled with impotency...

      Those are the literary utensils I feel like using while composing my next "luddite" YE OLDE FASHION BLOG.  Been trying for the last three hours to EDIT MY USER PROFILE so I could post a face to go along with my fingertips... (even though I think its tad vain and conceited and almost boarderline cupid-dot-comish)...I even downloaded that crazy Picasa thing from Blogger but it still doesn't acknowledge my Desktop or 'my photos' or dip into the files on my zip...Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!  Oh well. Nothing beats Campus 'pewters. Guess I'll have to frolic underneath the honed mask of anonymity. i was really pissed off, then my good friend arya via'd me a gift I can't wait to open and my other good friend daniela wrote a wonderful ditty about smoking, which of course, lulled me into passive nicotine-reminiscent abeyance.  Still not crazy about my sisters play tonight. Sappy musicals. Hot tent. I get to watch my beautiful sister Jenn solo and then make-out on stage and then watch her thesbian boyfriend talk about how cool he is afterwards. Fun Times..........

      What's up with me today? I can't stop blogging. I boxed up my novels last night for the move and its almost like...wow...I have lots of sentences that still need to hemmed, ploughed and water.  Hopefully I can get my BIG novel self-published next month. Considering paper and color illustartions, each printing costs me about $80 for about a limited run of ten that'll a give away to the people who compelled me to write it (its taken four years!!!!). Hopefully I'll have a copy or two left over so I can give it to that sexy middle-aged publisher at Random House who thinks I have potential if I can get my head out of the blog.   An aged-hippie just came in and bashed Bush for an hour before going off on Reagan's faux-pas antics. He then shook my hand and nodded at me, like I knew where he was coming from...   There's a short story by Donald Barthelme I've been thinking about today called The Balloon. "The Balloon, the exact location I cannot recall..." is how it starts. Its a really stupid story. It's about a New Yorker whose wife leaves him and, b/c he's so sad, he blows up a balloon. All of his sadness and everything that's inside his lungs feeds into the stretched rubber. The irony is, the balloon doesn't pop. It just keeps on growing and growing and eventually occupies most of New York City. Kids jump outta High Rises and flounce on the balloon like a trapoline. People get used to the balloon and eventually no one seems to mind that a giant clowns balloon has appropriated all of Lower Manhattan.  The irony is dual. New Yorkers everywhere are bouncing up and down on the narrator's exhaled sadness. Eventually, when the protagonist's wife comes back to him, the balloon becomes no big deal. No big deal at all. He poured everything that was inside of him into this permeable object and then, one day, pop..she's back, and her presence flitted perfectly inside his chest that place that had been huffing and puffing for all these months....  Started to think that maybe blogging has been my balloon and maybe all this writing is just a method of interior investigation. Where's my Dad? Who is crazy Mike? Who's the faceless femme with the bubble-gum name? What's up with all these crazy carousel rotations!  God I love every second of existence!!!!

      ...or are you just happy to see me? Yeah, blogging's addictive. Everyone in the office is huddled around the television evincing mock-elegies for Ronald Reagan. There was a tornado warning last night and I stammered up to my balcony to try to espy a glimpse of the vortex funnel, only to get doused with massive amounts of golf ball sized hale. Uncle Mike was being ornery last night, too. He still had on his Caterpillar work-badge and said that if the tornado did sweep through our abode, the coronary would be able to identify him immediately. Whereas I would probably get my laminated-wallet identity pillaged by looters and remain anonymous until my first novel-- a horrible novel I wrote when I was twenty about Basketball and Opera (?)--somehow arises from the shelves of its underground cult status and becomes recommended reading, henceforth adding to the aura of my mysterious demise....  The Harry Potter books are brilliant and I'm head over kneecaps in love with JK Rowlings. Reading THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX last summer it was just like....there were PERFECTLY constructed sentences. Perfect. Sentences that read like a shaft of light streaming through stain glass windows inside of St. Pauls cathedral. So-called snobbish "literary" theorists and critcs despise this sort of ' low art'--but my personal aesthetic is this...the absolute HIGHEST form of art their is occurs when a writer (artist) creatively propels and encourages young minds to read and write. Very few writers I know of can do this (CS Lewis and a few scholastic scholars comes to mind). I think Rowlings achieves this and does so with class and grace....   My friend Chrissy just strutted in and filled me in about the Swissy-Missy fiasco (sniff). Why do all these transient girls have Sweet Valley High teen-age monikers for names?   Uncle Mike panned a few of my short stories last night. Told me that I'm very good I just try to go for the 'shock' value too much. 'Geez. I've known Mike for three years and his normal cavil in regards to my work is that "People won't be able to understand it."  Although one time I read him a short story about Sarejevo called "WHERE ALL THE DREAM CHARACTERS DREAM,TOO." and he was silent for a long time and then told me that it was pretty good for a human. Not that a caged Chimpanzee doesn't harbor a random plunge at Hamlet every now and then.  Uncle Mike then told me some cool stories about Pearl last night then told me not to write them down.  "You're getting people too excited." He said. He then blathered about mis-firing of chemical synapses in the brain. "People need to be attracted to the faith because of the threading of both spiritual and practical principles into one universal strand." Mike huffed.  He said that when he worked for the Universal house of Justice in Haifa if one of the hosue members had a 'dream' or a 'vision'--that was the person the house as a whole body believed the least.  "The House members are the most practical people you'll ever meet." Mike says.  When Mike asked me if I'd write down the stories I told him what I tell everyone. That I write everyday and that I'd write with unbidden honsety if granted the opportunity.  *

        Too early in the morning to muse over John Milton. Whereas the cast and company of RENT may measure their life in cups of coffee sprinkled with seasons of Love, I've always-- for some weird reason--measured my life in four year increments correlating perfectly with the pending Presidential campaign, the olympic games and the anomolous leap year. Always have...it seems like every four years I tersely look back, ask myself where the hell I am suppose to be going, looking over the palces I have already traveled wondering what avenue will appear next....  ...Voluntarily chose to go see my sister tonight in Carousel. God I hate musicals and my whole family did summer stock growing up. Jenn has the lead but the play is like FOUR hours (is this a cheesy-lighthearted musical or a Wagnerian Opera?)My sister's also do beauty pageants. Beth was Miss Chicago three years ago and almost won Miss Illinois (the girl who beat her became Miss America)...Jenn's trying to win the state tiara this year and I hate going, hate seeing my sisters gambol around stage in heels and tights posing like their limbs are constructed out of orgami. Hate watching my sisters (MY OWN SISTERS) prostitute their brains in their bathing suits. Hate watching them be leered and ogled by middle-aged judges.....and regardless what anyone says, they still look like Drag Queens daubed in all that make-up!!!   Oh well, to compound matters mom just called. Turns out I have to share a hotel room with Jenn's boyfriend, Eric--who I can't stand!!! I almost (I shit you not here) hit him on Christmas eve! I'm not alone. Beth's husband Dan (who's in med school and who's mind and persona is poured like a Kennedy) can't stand him either. Oh well, I'll try to give him another chance. Maybe I'll buy a gun and pretend to clean it out while talking to him about the time I used to castrate bulls in the summer.     Need to write. Need to write. Need to write.

      What the hell? Outta the trinity bloggers I'm the one still sitting at the kids table without a G-mail account. Oh, well. G-mail sounds like something Snoop-Dogg would use to check his e-mail anyway. I must've been passed-over by the G-mail seraphim because of my, (dare I say it) youth? I know, (as my other two bloggers scowl in my direction) it's not easy being young-folk. Kids these days. Daniela, you would've been a senior when I was a freshman in High School and would've chuckled at my romantic foibles when I would have read to you a sonnet I composed for you in your native tongue....and I'm sure Arya was already endowed working on her PhD in all things Brilliant and Profound at that time (dare I speculate)...  Anyway, weird shit. I took ten year old Baha'i twins William and Zacahry out to see the new Harry Potter moive tonight and guess what, in the first five minutes, I shit you not, there, on the screen, was the brick house I had dreamed about and blogged about earlier in the day. Unreal (that's waht TS (BS) Eliot says about London in the Waste Land. "Unreal City. Unreal"  I'd continue blogging but of course, youth, curfew and Detroit is SMEARING LA!!!!

      Sleep. The most salubrious of human activities. The anatomical purgatory. The eyelids fluttering, swiping pupils back and forth like REM windshield wipers. The body, strained, convulsing, dreaming, revisiting the inner utero of thought and requests, nocturnally gyrating, palpitating, drooling, tumbling, following, seething, blossoming open into a lotus of sketched pedals...Last night I am in London with a faceless girl who is showing me her underwear before the charter bus ferries us through the swanky suburbs. We are in London and I am with her even though I am alone. I am talking to my mom  on the bus, telling her that I have finally made it back, that I have finally made it back to the hoi-poloi of England. The mad dash of red buses, the mixture of suits and bodies. The swelling of limbs being chewed into the underground.   The bus is smashing through cemeteries, motoring through dual-laned roads. My faceless beloved and I are looking for a building, for a brick-lane house. For a place we can make love in. For a place we can cultivate a family in. For a place I can come home to everynight and give her a kiss on the cheek and a smack on the ass.  The England sky is lucid. Certain patches of it are so blue that they are almost appear to be crystal. I find myself walking outside the border of my dream, walking next to the Thames; my body hooked to a visionary-reel so that it feels like with each step I am pulling the entire panel of atmosphere, the ambiance, the scene; with each sure-fire step of my gait I am hositing the next frame of existence with me and I am walking in tandem with the Thames river, walking by myself, walking alone and with England inside of me. I am wearing a suit with my hair pulled back and I am sure and shitfire that the direction I am going is the direction I have gone before.....

       Am I getting in touch with my feminine side? Box of kleenex, barrel of Starbucks mochachino ice cream, Jerry McQuire on the television set and every time Amy Dalley's 'Men Don't Change' line-dances across the radio I begin to sing along with the hick lyrics:   Cupid works for the devil: be suspicious if he cries: "You know sex is usually good." Yeah, but it ain't always right. Chocolate is a band-aid, no matter what they say, Shoes don't stretch, An' men don't change.   God love it. Uncle Mike and I are in the process of moving and as always, viewing your possesions heaped in moldy cardboard squares gives you perspective on what is important. What you can take with you. What you can live without. So much of emphasis in a material-driven society tottering with human loneliness at the same time. It astounds me. Astounds me more than hippie-elfs and  mystic-recluses. What people value as externally important vs. the internal drive to feel as human as possible.    Good news is my health. The last twenty-four months have been open hurricane season on my body. I've been working roughly 60-80 hours a week, two jobs, trying to make bank, but blessed none the less. For a while I was working 8am to 2am everyday...heavily flooded with caffeine. Last May I actually had two days where I was forced to work 40 hours shifts intermittently and it just about floored me, only I'm always so zany and overly-exerted anyway...good news is that working odd hours forces you to write; compells you to analyze your life and acknowledge what you want to do with it.  But sleeps nice too. I've been averaging a stellar 10 hours a night and its UNBELIEVABLE. (Codeine-god love it. The miracle Vice!) My stress rashes and acne are also starting to subside. As is my caffeine intake. I don't care what anyone says, Starbucks imbibed under certain copious dosages equates nothing short of a lethal injection to the nervous system. Even certain powdry dust is nowhere in the same Java-area code as Starbucks. Of course that's debatable. I hate coke--I mean I really hate coaciane. Next to Heroin its the one drug that I've seen sew war havoc on individuals life. A good buddy of mine got heavily into it and he had a heart attack one night at age 24. He practically lost his septum too. He would just sit around and shove white-dust up his nostrils until they would bleed and he would then wedge flecks of cotton up there to quell the bleeding and then act like the reason his lips were crimson-coated was becasue of the altitude in the room.      But caffeine as well. I got my first coffee pot when I was fourteen and me, being the studious writer that I am, used to burn-out coffee pots in high school like a flailed academic rushing out his flat thesis. Trying to prove something no one really cares about. In high-school I wrote arrogant as all get-out "po-ems" (two syllables) and was a purported authority on everything. I probably should have come home with more wedgies. I probably sounded like many liberal art profs. today sound...overly important, solipsistic, academically-indulgent, vanity-driven. It takes a long ass time for the scholar, the poet, the artist to realize that the world of art (even the world) wasn't designed for their own personal carp and critique. Everything you do in life has to done for the benefit of humanity. It has to be done for the benefit of the other.   Example, suicides kinda run in my family. My mom trunk of the genealogical tree  (ironically Czech...her maiden name was Bozac and her grandfather was sponsored illegally in America as a Bottlegger, employed by Al Capone himself) has been riddled with them--mostly attempts. Four years ago my cousin Joey killed himself and he was only eleven.  Anyway. I went through alotta personal-shit around the time of Joey's death. I missed about a week of class and I had a fuckwad french prof. who told me that he was sorry for my loss but that it wasn't his problem.  He was correct, It wasn't, but it still pissed me off that he didn't seem to empathize. That he didn't seem to care. He was from Angola and had witness his own parents assignation at a very young age. He then had the gall to quote some existentialism verbiage a la John Paul Sartre about man's true teleos or prupose ended in dust anyway and how mankind was responsible for his own ass.  Ok, whatever, I had read Sartre, and me being the then academic-pedant that I was had also skimmed through Immanuel Levinas, a jewish-philosopher who was one of Sartre pupils. Levinas theories extrapolate from the ashes of the halocaoust and he agrees very adamantly with Sartre's no-afterlife views on the condition of mankind. Levinas branches off from sartre's bleakness by stating that mankind's true purpose in the world is to the capital-voweled Other or L'autre (in french). This is what intriniscally adds meaning to our lives...having an interface; harboring a rapport with other human beings. Helping them out as they help us out. Trying to cement a feeling of oneness in a planet that no-longer feels period, however terse that feeling may be....  I told my French Prof this and then I told him to have a good day, inserting a few choice vulgarities for affect, telling him to have a nice life. It was too late to officially drop the class and I received a volitional F. However, to this day, that conversation with my french prof. ranks as the most honest thing I've ever said, done or written in a classroom. And if I had to do it all again I would, but of course, I'd save my cousin first....

        Devastating morning. Feels like my tea cup heart has been inadvertantly dropped while being juggled by a midget or something. Just came back from emptying my e-mail account and I received that perfunctory reply from Swissy-Missy with the sentence, "random trips to Peoria to visit my sister and my boyfriend" sliced in the middle of a paragraph. Nothing is worse in a relationship than being the 'other' guy. God I hate this feeling.   *  Remember that scene from the first Rocky where his ring manager tells Rock-o to quit sleeping with Adrianne b/c "Women weaken legs!" Perhaps that's true with writers, "Women weaken prose!" Having a hard time reaching that bloggin' " end-zone" inside me this morning. And of course, I know inside that all I have to do is suck it up, throw a few punches and get back inside that ring and finish the bout.  *  Woke up this morning thinking about zookeepers adage which purportedly states that "cage any given homogenus species of the opposing sex for long enough and they'll eventually mate,"--Is this what college is? Is this what reality is? We're all lving in this atmospherical cage and, given close proximity, we'll eventually get it on?   *  "'Cause you know there's no gender in the next world." Uncle Mike informs me last night at dinner.  "What do you mean?" I look at him.  "What's the purpose of gender." He inquires.  "Procreation." I say. He nods.  "People have a hard time envisioning this. That the soul is without a sexual preference."  I have a hard time envisioning this. That our genitals and our our innate animalistic desire to feel oneness and to create a bridge of union between genders doesn't follow us to the next world.  *     Night I 'randomly' bumped into Swissy-Missy outside of One World I asked Mike why, if she wasn't interested in me or whatever, did she come on to me like she was in the first place.  "It was hormonal" He said, dismissing the matter.  "Oh," I say, looking at my elonagted shadow beneath a streetlamp.  *  If you have a life in the arts you inevitably run around with lots of people who are gay. Many of my best friends are gay and my best friend, David, and I have this long running joke that when my first wife leaves me for my sister or whatever, we're all gonna get together and have a guys night out and cry and watch a marathon viewing of LORD OF THE RINGS uncut for twelve hours straight and right at the apex of the film; right at the moment when Frodo finally free's himself of his fettered fire-hydrant-sized ego and chucks his ring into the lava of Mt. Doom I'll finally have the balls to remove my own wedding oval and chuck it into the mechanical gnaw of the garbage disposal and all my gay friends would formally applaud and address me as 'honey' and toast Zima and tell me that I could do better and she was really a bitch and then tell me that they secretly made bets before the wedding about how long my supposed nuptial rapport would last.  *  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I hate sound sounding sooooooo sullen.  *  There's a story I heard about Abdul-baha's parrot. Apaprently if you would poke his parrot it would only say one thing.  "Be happy!" The parrot would peep.  *  Ah, shit, nothin' like feeling heartbroken!!!!!

      "I can prove co-existence to you." Uncle Mike says, behind the steering wheel of his burgundy-flavored Lincoln as he combs the gravel swoops of I-74, the hilly patch of road that buckles Bloomington into Peoria.  "How," I ask, of course, incredulously.  "Take a deep breath." Uncle Mike asserts. Notice the world around you. What do you see?"  I tuck my chin in typical doubting Thomas skepticism. My lips contort. A distilling silence foams.    "Notice the world around you as you see it. Note the green pastures outside. Note the sound of my voice. Here the rattle of the air-conditioner. The cars positioned around us."  "Check, check check." I metally demarcate those items in my mind. Mike always pulls this shit. One second I'm a human being, sentient, easily awed by the rapid accleration of life in a dot-com and disparate culture, the next second I feel like I'm a grasshopper and Mike is telling me to have patience. "Patience Grasshopper." I hear him almost humming, informing me that life is not what I have always perceived it to be.  "Patience grasshopper."  *  Think I've milked my mystic udder dry this past week. Everyone I meet online is a purported mystic. It almost reminds me of that old Dr. Pepper commercial: "I'm a Mystic, Your a Mystic, He's a Mystic, She's a Mystic, wouldn't you like to be a Mystic, too?" I think about reading an old interview with publisher James McClaughlin, who published Hesse's Siddhartha and how he was kinda disgusted by the initial manuscript.  "True Buddhism is tough," he said, in between drag of his cigar. "Hesse made Buddhism sound like some cool-slap hippie past time and Buddhism is nothing like that. True Buddhism means giving up everything in order to gain everything.    "...wouldn't you like to be a Buddhist, too?"   *  My boy Nick is the writer who lives upstairs, works upstairs, dishes out sentences upstairs, stomps downstairs to my desk, gives me a long handshake. Inquires how my own writing's going. Nick used to work for a swanky East coast magazine where he was paid a dollar a word.  "No shit brother, a dollar a word." I ranted, the first time we met.  "David man its considerably low by industry standards."  "Still, man, a dollar a word." I stop, thinking that the last sentence I just said to Nick equated my hourly wage. Prior to deductions, of course.  Nick's been assiduously hammering out his novel for the last four years. He's older than I am and if you'd look at us from a distance you'd think he was a solid sentence shooting Dirk Nowitski to my long-haired loopy-dribbling Steve Nash. Last semester I went back to school full time for the first time since autumn 2000. I dropped (drank) out of school that semester. My rationale was that simply there'd be more sentences in my novels than there would be calligraphed on my diploma. And of course, I was right.  Not to mention that my "Christian" parents seemed to have borrowed a bar of soap from Pontious Pilate and washed their hands from their heathen son's literary proclivities very early in my academic trudge. Perhaps human beings wouldn't feel so compelled to plant psychedelic substances down their own throats or water their earthly vessels with bottles of non-mathmatical proofs if they could feel a sense of eternal bondage, a modicum of love, and overall feeling of purpose in the world.  Nick tells me he's a dry fountain. He's written the first two pages of his novel three-hundred times.  "David, bro, I've lost everything man. Everything."  I tell him he's my hero. I tell him how much I value seeing him tow his laptop into the library every day and sit on his ass with his literary bib on. I tell him to keep on chiseling away...that somewhere in the soil of those rocky pages is a newfound fossil unearthing a beautiful tale.  "David man, I'm 32. I need to have my shit together." I look at him. He looks back at me like I don'thave a clue about the vagaries of adulthood.  "Me being a writer has ruined ties with my family." Nick says. "I've lost girls becasue they can't stand that I write for a living."  I tell him the advice that Miss Mack used to tell me. I tell him to keep on keeping on. I tell him to have fun with it. I tell him to put the ball in the hoop. When I see him ambling across campus, I say out loud, "There's a writer!"  "Just finish the book." I tell him. "We just need to finish the book. We can't let this thing that was once our life preserver sink us like an anchor."  He looks back at me and adjusts his glasses.    "...wouldn't you like to be a writer, too?"      *  "Look around," Uncle Mike insists. "Absorb everything that is around you. Look at the windshield wipers. Hear the motorized hum of the engine. Notice the position of the sun overhead. Look at the digitalized numbers on the clock."  I comply.  "Ready," Uncle Mike says. "I'm going to prove to you that co-existence exists after all."   *  It was exactly a week before 9-11 and Kinkos wanted eighty dollars just to print off the third draft of my novel.  "Eighty bucks." I say, groping multiple zip drives.  "It's a big document. Plus it has illustrations." The dweeb employee says.  "But still, it should only be ten cents a page."  "You have alotta pages."  Later on that day I went down to the pay phone in front of the abandoned liquer store. I hadn't paid my cell phone bill in months and I needed to call home. In front of me walked a beautiful girl, dirty-diaphonous blonde hair and a tight black skirt that rose just above the tropic of Cancer if her thighs and legs were represntative of the globe . Her Make-up was late 80's sloppy and she wore thick trussed boots skimming past her knees.  Her entire body I swear, was made of porcelain.  "Give me ten dollars." She said, soliciting me.  "Honey I don't have ten dollars." I said. She walked closer.  "If you give me ten dollars I'll give you a blowjob." She said, very straight-forwardly. There was a hush of traffic. I fondled the stem of the phone. It was out of order. She was in close proximity. Her lips were smeared with something that smelled like raspberries.  "Do you give hugs?" I inquired, still tapping the silver squares on the phone, hoping that the din of the dial tone would somehow make her petitions dissipate.  "What," She looked at me. Her entire body was shaped like an exclamatory mark. Either in shock or perhaps disgust."  "Do you give hugs?" I asked again, allowing gravity's tug to deal with the phone I just dropped."  "Well...." She says, still looking at me. There was a gold-toothed black man across the street. She kept averting her vision into his.  "I'll give you everything that's in my wallet if you give me a hug."   She paused. When she said the word blowjob she looked behind a dumpster. Now she just looked at me like I was crazy.  "Here?" She says looking at me. Her eyes once again volleyed across the street.  "Why not," I said.         "Because," She said. She was taller than me. Her breasts were lower case a. From what I can surmise she was probably between seventeen and twenty-two years of age.  The next thing I know her arms were wreathed around me. It was almost like she was placing an invisible medallion around my neck. The embrace was terse, but there was a squeeze and for a moment, both of our eyelids zipped closed at the same time.  "Here," I say to her. I don't remember how much currency I had in my pocket. It wasn't much. It was green and crinkly. It was all I had left til' Monday. She took it and then turned her back, clacking the thick soles of her boots across the abandoned parking, yelling out the name of her pimp across the street.  "Shit." I said, looking at her back, tilling my fingers trhough my hair, wondering where the hell I am suppsoed to go after this.    "...wouldn't you like to sell your body, too?"    *  "I don't think I've really ever been in love before." Swissy-Missy tells me, inside the student Center. We are eating lunch.  "Yeah," I say    "Really," She says. Before grabbing my hand and pulling me down into her scent as if her own hand were made of plastic gym weights.   *  I ran home after I encountered the prostitute. I hurtled up into my apartment and dump over a box of  moldy books. I immediately open my cupboard. Everything that had a shelf life was hers. There were packages of roman noodles. There was little boxes of tofu. There was pasturized milk. There was sugar and instant coffee. There was rice-a-roni and mac-n-cheese. Everything that had a shelf life I had decided was hers. Cans of soup and tomato paste. Long elongated boxes of pasta and fettuccini. All hers. I ran into my room, diving into my book shelves, looking for my old comfirmation bible. My name and the Date APRIL 12 1992, initialed in silver cursive in the lower right-hand corner.  I was going to save her.  With the heap of goods boxed into my chest I ran. I didn't care who she had slept with. I didn't care if she was HIV +. I was going to save her. She could sleep in my room. She could take care of the house while I was at work. I'm sure I could bullshit with a fellow failed academic and get her into a community college.  I ran.  By the time I arrived at the parking lot it was vacant. The wood covering the gunshot gutted windows of the liquer store looked like patches, thwarting universal vision from myopic sight. I stood beneath the early September sun looking for her. I crossed the street. I went behind the Thrift store. I tried shouting out her name but then remember that I never asked for it. She asked me for a blowjob. I demanded only a hug. Currency was exchanged, names weren't.  I still had the box of food and my comfirmation bible in my hands. She was nowhere to be seen. It had been only fifteen minutes since our embraced. Our city wasn't that big.  "Hey kid," A Mexican head jutted out from the side of the liquer store. He was smoking a cigarette.  "What," I asked him, pissed off. I wanted to hit him.  "You lookin' for someone, yo?" He asked. He was in his undershirt.  "No," I said. "I'm not at all. Not at all."  As I turned around I noticed that the phone was still off the hook. It swayed in the manner of a pendulum; in the manner of a suicide, back and forth. For some reason though, I could swear I could hear the dial tone emitting a din warble.  I set the box of food down at the corner, next to a gray fire hydrant. I fished out my bible I hadn't cracked open in over five years.  I walked home alone.    "...wouldn't you like to be a savior, too?"   *  "Are you ready now?" Uncle Mike says. We are still in his Lincoln. "Okay, wait a minute, I'm going to show you that co-existence is valid."    *  With my bible tucked under my paw I began to fucking cry. Everything that was fueled up above my cheekbones suddenly broke into millions of shattered stain glass tears. I cried becasue of the direction my life was headed. I cried because I lost Vanessa two years prior. I cried because it seemed like my parents wanted shit to do with me outside of Chruch on Sunday. Cried because it seemed like I was always trying to go somewhere; trying to push my dreams out from the port inside of me; push off into the sea of reality only to watch the ship sink in shallow water.  I cried. And then I cried some more. I couldn't even save a prostitute who had her arms bobbling around my neck, momentarily, as if for support.    *  "No," Swissy-Missy says, biting into her sandwhich on wheat bread. "I've never been in love. Have you?" She says, her eyes bat. Her skin is silk. Once again she grabs my hand.  "Yes," I tell her. " Yes I have."    "...wouldn't you like to fall in love, too?"     *  I am blogging an entry titled WAYARD DEVOTIONAL FOR A SUNDAY AFTERNOON. I am writing about a prostitute. I am writing about Swissy-Missy and Co-existence. I have been writing for a couple hours. I decide to go outside for a walk.  I walk the path I always walk. It is freshman orientation here on campus. The student center is fraught with girls wearing tanktops and low jean-shorts and name tags. I walk out past the Student Center. I make a V-cut across the quad, alter my gait and head towards the tinted shadow of the library.  There are three people walking around. The females are older, they wear chic librarian spectacles. One is the color of lipton tea with a shock of straight black hair. She is syringe skinny and she reminds me of my mom.  In a weird way I want to give her a hug  The guys name is Matt. He is wearing khakis and a polo shirt. His hair is cut very short and is spiked with gel. He has a smile that looks like a roast beef sandwhich. I wave at them. The Sun is pushing heavy shafts of translucent light over the top of Bradley Hall casting circus tent shadows across the quad. The sky is so blue is could be mistaken for certain vectors of the Carribean.  "Do you mind if we ask you a couple of questions."  Matt says, offering his feigned smile. The woman who reminds me of my mom opens up a notebook and starts chronicling my responses down. At first I think they want to ask for directions. But no, they ask me if I were to die today and God were to ask me "Why should I let you in?" what would I say.  I look back at them and smile.       "...wouldn't you like to get into heaven, too?"   *  I am holding my confirmation bible across my chest and I am crying. I curse God for not allowing me the chance to save her. I curse God because I'm always poor and seem to try so hard. I curse God because my parents don't even give a fuck about me.   I hear two beeps from across the street. It is Mike. The crazy psychic from down the street.  "What are you doing?" He says. I suck up my tears. I try to pawn off the color of my face on allergies. He smiles.  "Well, get in." He says.   I don't want to but I do.  As we drive around downtown P-town I look for the flock of prostitutes. He circles around SWINGERS WORLD I wonder if she is inside.  "Who are you looking for." Mike asks me.  "I don't know." I tell him. "I don't know where she's at."  "Well she has to be somewhere." Mike says, a flecked look of eternity cached in his logic. "Everyone has to be somewhere."   "True," I nod, still dubious of his purported psychic abilities even though he tells great stories. Last week he told me that he first realized that he had a gift when he was eight years old. He was living with his grandparents and he had a dream that his Grandfather ahd died. This dream freightened him so much he ran into his grandparents bedroom and slinked between their bodies. Two hours later, he was awakened to his grandmothers voice shrilling in his ears.  His grandfather was dead.  *  The trio of Baptists apporve of the answers I am giving so far. I have told them that yes, sure, I agree that Jesus was the son of God. I believe he was a dispensation of the light. They smile. I smile. We seem to be getting along fine. Matt has already made an analogy comparing the free-gift of eternal life to that of a Sports car.  "Say it was your Birthday tomorrow, David." He says, his pawned jerkey smile a stye in my sight.  "And say I gave you a free sports car and then you gave me say,  three dollars for it...was the gift really free then?" His voice sounds friendly and fake. Almost like he is talking to me about morality behind the wooden bars of crib.   I smile. My mother is Baptist. My father was on the Lutheran Evangelical board growing up, He loved to tell people about Jesus.  "Or lets say there's two boats. There's the David boat with a hole in the bottom of it from earthly sin and then there's a Jesus boat that's golden and without flaw..."  I make a concious effort to smile. We seemed to be getting along just fine until they asked me what Chruch, Synagogue or Parish I attend and my answer was an unlisted "Baha'i Center". They keep talk about sin like I have just given the pastor's daughter chlamydia.  The woman who looks like my mom holds up a wad of jingling keys and begins to play "this-little-piggy" with them.       "Now I have lots of keys on my keycain but only one of them is the key that lets me into my Fathers house." She says with an aura of superficiality.  I am lost. I smile. In my mind there is a picture of a dervish. Too much mysticism in the past week. I think of the friends I have made online and I think of their own sentences. I try to picture them smiling behind their sentences. I try to picture them smiling while they pelt out sentences into their own blogs.  Then I say the greatest name inside my head. I say it over and over again. Like the plastic weathervane on top of a beanie; the name spins and spins as I say it to myself. I look at my mother, telling me that only a personal-relationship with Jesus is the key to Heaven. I say the greatest name in my head. I say it so loud that I say it with cymbals and timpani. I say it until I am dizzy, the three-idividuals looking at me, talking about grace and assurance and I am smiling, looking past them, looking at the hard slices of light ferrying down to where I am standing.   "So, again, david, can you say with certainity that if you were to die to toady God would hand you the Key to eternal life?" My mom says, holding up a rugged silver tooth in front of me.  I think about the greatest name. I think about the prostitute whose name I never learned. I wonder if the Baptist Canvassers would see her on the street, I wonder if they would walk up to her and ask her for a hug. If they would try to give her food and offer her one of their own bibles. I wonder if she would listen to them or be put off because they look like they have just stepped out of a Land's End catalougue.  I think about my dad. How some of the best times of his life were sharing the gospel.  "Yes," I say, smiling. "I think I found the key."  *      Mike drops me off in front of my apartment. For most of our drive I was silent. I told him that I tried to help someone out today and yet I failed. I mentioned only in passing that I had wanted to print out the third draft of my year old novel but that Kinkos wanted eighty dollars for it.  "Here," Mike says, his right hand pushing into his back pocket. He takes out two green bills.  "Why don't you go to the library and print your book out. It should't be more than forty dollars."  Mike, this is way too much. I say, not wanting burden anyone else financially.  "Well if you don't use it, who else am I going to give it to?" He says rhetorically before I give him a hug, the second hug I'd given in as many hours.   *  Last time I saw Jasna I took her out for a date to an Indian restaurant and then out for a concert at Weslyan. We spent the whole day relaxing, sleeping, lounging around her apartment. I had not seen her previously in almost eight months.  "We need to get ready, Daveeeeed." Jasna says. I am tired. I am sleepy. I am content just milling around her place. But, yes, we need to get ready.  "Here, I am going to change." She said. There was no door that seperated the guest bedroom from the hallway so she folded the doors of the hallway closet and bathroom into a wooden V, occluding my sight.  "What are you doing?" I said, almost offended. Although we were not lovers we were used to each others body.  "You are so silly, Daveeeeed!" Jasna says, smiling adjusting the doors.   "Why don't you just change out here." I say, walking towards the bathroom, splashing water on my face, trying to wake up.  "You are so silly Daveeeeed." She laughs, her face beaming from behind the V-cusped doors. I hear her voice and try to squint through the wooden fissure, her body pulling itself into a string of shadows.  "Stop, Daveeeeed." She says. "You think about sex too much. That all you ever think about!"     "I don't," I say, feeling seminally rejected. I wander back into the living room. I yell at Jasna to hurry up. I put a Tom Petty CD on. I start pantomiming the words to "Learning To Fly." I frisk the lower shelf of the refrigerator for libations. I toss punches at my own shadow, deeply elongated under the lights of her apartment. I think about how Tom Petty always reminds me of Martina Navratilova in his face.   There is a shuffle and the the sound of wood being closed. And there is Jasna, radiant, dressed all in black, her hair pinched back in twin diminutive red braids.  She looked stunning.  "Ok, Daveeeeed." Jasna says, groping my arm. "We can go now, Daveeeed."  And so we left as one unit.    "....don't you wish that life could be so new?"   *  "You ready?" Mike asks, awaiting to affirm his co-existence opus. I have already closed my eyes. I have soaked up my ambiance as if my entire anatomy were a sponge. I am waiting for Mike to verify co-existence to me.  "Now listen," Mike says "Are you ready. Co-existence." I nod, try to tell him to get on with it by orchestrating my chin. The next thing I know Mike is adjusting the plastic nubs on the radio. There is the crackle static representative of AM radio.  "See," Mike says, a flash of laughter jets across his face. He is freely pressing nubs like a switchboard operator at happy hour.  "Co-existance!" He says, laughing, looking at the chagrined look tatooed on my own face. He is still laughing and pressing buttons. The static AM warble is starting to get to me.  "And look," Mike says, still laughing. "There's even FM." He says, with almost a metaphysical snort of realization.  "Yes," I say, looking out into the window shield at the invisble outline of my own whirred reflection. "There's even FM," I say to myself before smiling.  Everyone.   "I'm a Pepper, Your a Pepper, He's a Pepper, She's a Pepper, wouldn't you like to be a Pepper, too?"

      * At the end he went on out and found her, and then he went on out and found himself.   -Wauwatosa adage *   I first started writing snobby self-indulgent poetry in autumn 1994, Junior year of High school, in Ms. Mack's American history class. Ms. Mack had beautiful lanky black skin that shined like wet leather; a whirlpool of thick hair that erupted from her skull whenever she clacked her heels in excitement. Miss Mack loved writing; loved eccentric, standoffish students--students with a paucity of thick varsity letters void from their trenchcoats. Her voice could open these students seventeen year old chests up as if with a crowbar. She would always encourage her students to give her a little "sugar" in their essays. To sprinkle sentnces with vivid images. And if you wrote a poem, than, sugah, use wuza using God's LANGUAGE to its FULL potential.      I was in love with Jennifer Elise W***** (now Jennifer Elise who married my friend David's younger brother). Jennifer was a mousy-faced freshman cheerleader who I had the priveledge of chaperoning the previous summer on a Eurpean choir tour. She had an acerbic no-shit wry humor and potty-mouth demeanor that saddled my heart before kicking it with rubber spurs. Plus I thought her face looked like, at the time, a cross between Winona Ryder and Shanon Doherty (very Hello Gorgeous in the early '90's) even though she was about the size of Toulouse-Lautrec.   What can I say. Even though she had just graduated from eighth grade and I was still learning how to parellel park back in the states, I found myself emotionanlly gunning red lights of caution and the two of us cemented a rapport where we would cuddle and tickle and she would address me as "Big Brother."   "Big Brother. My crazy, crazy bro." She would always say before making what she called a "pig-dog" face (leftover from the German leg of our tour) and jumping on top of me.   This happened for about half the tour. We would start out watching TV in a Parisian hotel room and end up asleep, using each others limbs as a bib for our nocturnal drool.    Sometime in London that summer she started writing me letters. They were inky and each i was dotted with litte bow-tie hearts. And sometime later on in those weeks in London she fell in love with Tanner, another boy I was two years older than and was chaperoning.  Her letters became more detailed. Her body was a greenhouse where her lips were always spring. We would still kick-it after rehersals, but our body's sloppily collided less and less and eventual the saltine features of her cheeks became foreign to me  * We went to the same high school in the states and that's when I started writing. My writing was pretentious and egoistic with metaphores that were both flaccid and familiar but every poem I wrote Miss Mack would give me a hug, tell me to "keep on keeping on". Even though Miss Mack knew they were sloppy, she encouraged me--and how little we have that today, not only in academia, but also in the community. Every poem I wrote Jennifer Elise seemed to scowl at me a little bit more in the hallway. I became accustomed to seeing the back of her body in her cheerleading outfit.  *  Here is the first poem I ever heard that sat in that place inside my chest and made me want to write. I read this poem in front of my entire high school my senior year. And, although I've never 'officially' read it to Jennifer Elise, pretty much every other girl that's heavily lassoed my heart has heard it. It's a poem by Walt Whitman that I first heard read by Garrison Keilor on THE WRITERS ALMANAC. Who knows, perhaps it was even a precursor to something I have sinced discovered. Something which, at the time, if you would have told me I would have found it, I would have probably told you that you were delusional.   "I have perceiv’d that to be with those I like is enough,     To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,    To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough,    To pass among them, or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck for a moment—what is this, then?    I do not ask any more delight—I swim in it, as in a sea.        There is something in staying close to men and women, and looking on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well;     All things please the soul—but these please the soul well. "       -I Sing the Body Electric.

      Blog of gratitude. Been Blogging for a little over a week now and what a blessing it has been to have a creative discourse with individuals whose spirit and intellegence far supersedes that of your own. To read Daniela's poetry and hear all about her vivacious cultural life. To hear about Arya's spiritual sojourns to wow, just about about everywhere on the spiritual atlas and have her give my fourth-dimesional heart a psycho-analytical "Sissy-fissy" rendering gratis. To have keyhole links to other Bahai's and to squint into their own cosmos...It's really been a blessing. Before blogging I had approx. zippo contact with Bahai's my own age, which is really no big deal on one hand, but of course, its nice to have people who are also visionaries tucked into your life. People who are also dreamers. People who allow you to be your crazy self because you love their crazy selves. And people who don't look at you funny or judge you when you say that Persian word for "God" and "Light". So, from the outset of this blog, allow me to bleed my gratitude: The pleasure has been all mine, my friends. Lets go make some more sweet music together.    Cool creative writing teacher Lee Newton stopped in to see me yesterday. I told him about my recent grad-school tour. Told him how I was the youngest person at the Fitzgerald Theatre for Prairie Home Companions 30th anniversary show. Told him how I gave my extra-ticket away to the box office prior to the show b/c the honeynut-wild eyed fair skin girl who I had hoped would accompany me on my tour opportunely had other plans. Told him about the spare seat next to me in the theatre and how a portly, roast-beef chinned man started taking off his clothes in bushy  heaps, and how, at the end of the broadcast, the seat where I had hoped my heart would be reclined was nothing more than a mountaneous heap of linen sweaters and even sneakers (?).     Told Lee about the loneliness I felt stomping around the "prestigious" Iowa's writers workshop. How it seemed like all the creativity was sucked out of the Dey house in a stale kiss of literary theory.     And of course I told Lee about how I left an autograph stack of my recent 'in print' work in the common reading room at the worskshop--how I even slid a copy of the journal beneath poet Dean Young's door.                              *   What I admired most about Arya's dream entry yesterday was her candor. She talks about that moment when she shoved God out of her life. That takes allota courage to write about something like that.                                          *   Gave prof. Newton my Blog address, he looked at me with his wry, cheshire cat grin and more or less told me to get my head out of the blog and get back into the ring with my novel. Try to go a couple more rounds with the book and see if you can knock it out of your system and into the grubbing palms of a publishing house.  "You'll care more about your book in a couple more years if you don't finish it now." He said. He writes poems.  "I know," I said. But still, I'm getting my words in everyday.                               *  There's a story about Abdul-baha and and how when he was at Wilmette he laid the corner stone for the House of Worhip and simply said, "It's Built."  From what I can glean, Bahai's are supposed to use this as a visionary metaphor for dreams (personal and within the realm of the faith) to be actualized and cemented.                                *   In my novel there is a scene about the "Nucelar Woods" where the young boys gambol beneath the melting tangerine thermostat of the sun. Being a first novel it is extremely autobiographical   (sophomoric) in certain respects. Yesterday, Patrick McReynolds, the protagonist of the novel (his nom de plume is Pat McCRotch--get it? His physiology is poured like an Irish potato sack and he's very precocious)and myself, slipped into the wooden sleeve of the actual "nuclear" woods for the first time in thirteen years. We took our shirts of and spalshed in the orange jetsam of the creek. I ruined a pair of shoes trampling over rocks and weeds. When we got to a part of the creek we used to call "The Skipper" we just laughted. There was still gang graffiti everywhere. Expired initials added together for the whims of eternity. Heavy Metal bands that our parents warned us were instruments of Satan.  "It's funny." Patrick said. "The graffiti changes but the message stays the same." He said, turing his back and taking a piss in the far end of the Skipper. Before he quoted out a sentence from my novel, a draft he read becasue he told me that he was going to make "Technological amemdations" to my laptop, but somehow forgot all about that once he clicked on page Microsoft Word.

        Dawn wets her moist lips early against a sea of green pastures and I have started to dream again. After work my body arrives home to bed late--plummeting on my matress, sinking into a pool of gulped darkness, drifting into forked waves of oblivion. I seem to resist this yawn; being digested into the dream fabric of shadows and illusions, the cloaked needle of night weaving feral cave-paintings on the inside of my eyelids.     I get out of bed, coerce myself to shower, allow the thick stem of liquid ablution to hiss over my shoulders. I towel off and fall back into the pond of night, floating across a stream of cusped images ferried by voices of females; an orchard of flesh.     In the moring I am reeled from my air-matress like a trout unsuspectingly yanked from a creek. My eyes are crusty-orbs, my vision askance. I totter around the room, I brew coffee in the kitchen, hawk out all the accumulative gunk heaped in my throat.     I wonder where I am going. I wonder what will be stringed out of me at work. I slightly ponder over the nocturnal barge I have just waded out of wondering what shore I would have paddled off to had I allowed those cupsed mosaics to drift further, to stroke my thoughts out into the sea of night only to wake up, under water, my breath occluded, my dreams only to be actualized and cemented by the tappering of each key. The completion of each sentence. The sound of her voice when she looks at me and smiles and tells me no, there's nothing that I can help her find today. Nothing at all.

        Typical male slob, that's what I feel like today. In an attempt to verify my virility, I feel like stomping around my pad all day in boxers and a baseball cap; I'm drinking milk straight from the carton, burping at my leisure. I'm allowing the dishes to accumulate in a disheveled heap and if I feel like washing them anytime soon in the near millenium, I'll baptize them with liquid soap and plug in the garden hose from the deck. I'm listening to gansta rap so loud that the entire floor of my apartment is wobbling up and down like a corpulent fat-millionaires double-clefted chin. I'll have the grill going all day, I want BEEF!!! None of this vegetarian ersatz-Boga styrofoam. Pure, unalloyed, Aaron Copland chiming in the background beef--straight from the udder to the grill, blazed up so that you can see little wisps of aroma steaming from my patio like a white flag. I'm walking with a limp and gesticulating with my hands and hell if I care what hemisphere the so--called lid is adjusted to when I leave the bathroom.  Can you tell I'm psyched about Detroit in the NBA playoffs?  I hate the Lakers. Let me amend that previous assertion, I Loathe, Despise, Detest, Abhor (insert your vitiating synonym for hate here) the Lakers. Have hated them ever since I held down folding chairs for the varisty elite in Junior high and sporadically the Coach would put me in at the end of the game to foul. Hate the feigned new age zen tea-room purportedly well-read guru Phil Jackson pawns himself off as. Can't stand bully-Shaq- Hall-of-famer-my white-ass; now how you gonna be an immortalized basketball player if you continually shoot fifty percent from the line? A well-trained monkey can even do that. There was an 80 year old man who made over three-thousand free-throws from a wheel chair a month ago. And here's SHAQ-think he's all that becasue he's looks like a disfigured Pepsi machine--all the brother needs to do is spend three hours a day, thirty-five percent of a workday, breezing free-throws. But, no, typical slothful millionaire. He's just lazy. If he'd quit making recursive loops around the buffet maybe he wouldn't embarrass the entire state of Claifornia everytime his size-18 addidas graces the charity stripe.  And Kobe. Honestly, if he'd play for any other team I'd be cheering the brother on. That was until last summer. If he was living in certain countries across the Atlantic and pulled the shit he did his pecker would already be guillotined and he'd be singing the Star Spangled banner with a high-pitched soporano-shrill. But no, intrinisically he's telling kids to get as much as possible, and if your ass gets caught, get a lawyer who knows how to manipulate the truth.  But that's just my opinion, on a day when I've already built my treehouse in my backyard Tree of Knowledge and thumb tacked a little cardboard No Girls Allowed sign in the tree house window. Sorry Eve, you can frolic in the garden and juggle apples for all I care. Play with snakes, be the more superior genus-- be the form that will inspire countless Adam's to drool their thoughts into aesthtic oblivion. That's totally cool.  Things w. Swissy-I-forget-her first-name are gradually wending their way to ashes. Adam doesn't care if he gets his rib back. He's content with the hollowness he's feeling inside his chest right now. Sometimes when a relationship doesn't work out, its a blessing on both sides of the pending-nuptial fence. Both sides have a chance to grow. As John Lennon once posited, "The more real you get, the more unreal life is gonna get." I couldn't concur more. Find out what is inside your chest that place where you not only feel real; find that place where you feel, and loft their like you are lounging on a futon, sipping champagne, clad in your boxer-briefs and twisted baseball cap, with your mind on your money and your money on your mind. Livin' Large.  Here's some cool lyrics (solace lyrics) by folk singer Greg Brown. Ironically (sychronously) his father, William Brown, was a peripatetic open-bible preacher most of his life, felt called to the ministry, started rustic churches all over Southern Iowa, prayed in tongues. In his fifties William felt the spitual tug and sated a mystical yearning. He went to Arizona to make jewlery and then, sonuvabitch, became Baha'i (I fell over when I heard that). He even re-wired the House of worship before he died so if it burns down anytime in the near future we know who to blame.   "would she have said it was the wrong time if I had found her then i don't want too much  a field across the road and a few good friends she used to come & see me but she was always there & gone even the very longest love does not last very long she'd stand there in my doorway  smoothing out her dress & say "this life is a thump-ripe melon--so sweet and such a mess"                                          -Rexroth's Daughter  Peace!!

        Unbelievable. Sunday gave birth to a blog forum vis-a-vis myself and every other blogger I know. It was sort've a mystic/nuptial scuffle if that makes any sense--plus I had that stupid Beatles song resonating in my head all day. "Blackbird singing in the middle of the... BLAM!  There. Just shot that damn blackbird for annoying, ornithological purposes.    Anyway when I arrived home my crazy, "mystical" roomate almost vehemently insisted that we go out right away, even though it was late. My roomate's much older than I am and he actually saved my life once (more later)...He's sort of Gandalf to my emotionally-fettered Frodo if that analogy makes any sense. When I told him "NO, I'm exhausted, I'm sulking, I'm whatever it's called when you bleed out all the blogs that's been stowed inside your body all day when you should've been nursing your three-year old (novel, that is) out of the cradle and into publication" He just looked at me, was quiet, paused, told me that was my problem, and then INSISTED we go to One WORLD cafe.    "But Mike, duh, One World cafe closes early on Sunday. Everything closes early on Sunday" I kept verbally emitting to him even he wouldn't listen. We just had to go to One World cafe. Even though when we drove past the building before parking I could see that dusk was settling inside the dining room area of the restaurant and that half of the woodedn chairs had already been stacked on top of their respective tables. We still had to go inside. When he parked, I opened the door and he just remained dormant and glazed-eyed in his drivers seat. Eventually, he adjusted his body and closed his door, walking very fast in front of me. He entered the door first and just as I was walking in, someone else, someone very angelic, sensually-scented was walking out. It was that someone I had kissed and held and said goodbye to three weeks earlier b/c she lives four hours away and wasn't coming back to P-town this summer. It was someone I had dashed e-mails soaked in dreams off to...it was that same someone who was deemed a "beautiful fool" only hours before. It was Swissy-Missy.   If your a lover you know what its like to see someone you love and (for whatever reason) not be able to embrace them. It was a no contact salutation. She was going out while I was coming in and our respective visages mirrored each other through the doorway of One World Cafe and Cargo, corner of University and Main. I held the door open for her and she was the first to say hello. She looked lovely--ashen countenance, body that looked like it had just come out a shell and was immortalized in paint by Boticelli.    Again, it was a no contact, non-embrace salutation. Incidentally, looking back on the situation now with harried hindsight, it was the only time we'd ever seen each other and not hugged. Mike had already been swallowed into the darkness of the building that I told him from the outset was in the process of closing. Missy and I just sort of looked at each other. I felt like Al PAcino in the end of GodfatherIII, looking sullenly oblique into a casket, rhetorically asking myself where did I go wrong.         Unbelievable. Crazy coincidence? WE blogged many poignant paragraphs on Sunday but seeing Sissy-Missy was definitely the punctuation mark. Mike ambled back out of the cafe with a nonpluss look sewed into his face. "WE can't eat here. They're closing." He said   In the car I told him. I told him all about Arya and co.; told him all about my recent fetish towards blogging. Availed to him who that person was on the corner who I had just chatted with.    Mike said more. He said alot more. He quoted one of the Hands as having said "There are no coincidences in the faith," He talked about the concourse. Talked about plurality. Said that he he had indeed heard me chide him about the cafe closing he just felt that we had to go inside.  When I told him that I didn't care that Swissy-Missy was in town, I just didn't need to meander into her in such a weird way, he told me that the concourse didn't care.....  The crazy thing is, shit like this happens all the time.

      It's Heartland baha'i school here at Bradley which is a very special time for me...Williams cafeteria where I eat lunch at during the school year plays host to the bookstore. Uncle Mike gives elcetric, humble speeches teeming with gumdrop anecdotes. This morning I was priveledged (Blessed) to work with youth culled from all over Illinois. We trimmed bushes at the center and I listened to their stories. I asked them queries. How did your parents hear about the faith? What was it like growing up beneath the aura of the teachings? Mona just came back from a devout year of service in Belgium and is contemplating studying psychology at U of I. Anna is homeschooled and her dad was offered a job in Hafia, only he turned it down because of family.Twins Ben and Mark playfully mauled me when I went to lunch. And Brilliant Andrew, a thirteen year old chess savant and also a DIRE Cub fan, assisted me in devising our 'secret' handshake. He told me that he hopes to get his Doctorate in Civil Engineering (which he importantly informed me will be twelve years of school) unless he makes the roster of a professional soccer team.  I heard all about the peacokcs in Baji. The fragrant-scent tithed by a single Israeli rose stemmed outside the master's shrine.  I heard about the House of Worship in Germany and in Somoa. I heard about the Guardian's grave in London.  I met a cool young married couple from Aurora who just became baha'i in the last year. They were an interracial smile...thread filched from a seraphim's garment...sort of imagine Othello with a friendly raucous gentle spring thunderstorm of a laugh and Desdamona sloughing her histrionics, not afraid to hold her husbands hand and give it a squeeze in public. We were pulling weeds at the center and the husband just couldn't stop laughing. At his own foibles "Oh..That's what Poison Ivy looks like." He just couldn't stop offering a steep, hearty chuckle. It was almost like the concourse was pouring out their verbal orchestrations and smiles using this man's voice as a filter.  As always, I get their stories. I salivate for their narratives. Her first husband had died of cancer and she found a Baha'i book at Barnes and Nobles of all places. He had heard about the faith when he lived in Urabana, ironically at a junior high school where she used to teach at. Even more so ironic (TC SMILES) they had grown up within a three blocks of other and NEVER recall seeing the other before they themselves were spiritually doused with blankets from the light.  I tell them my stories too. Tell them how Uncle Mike found me when I was drinking heavily, stirring up fatuous sentences for my first novel. Tell him how Uncle Mike would just appear. Tell them about how I wasn't allured to the faith at first, how I honestly thought it was about some guy named "Bob" who was martyered for trying to collate a thesis that all religions were essntially one giant integer set in the shape of a Persian sunrise.  I tell them how I was afriad of Mike. How, when I purposefully turned off my cell phone and "forgot" about the Naw Ruz dinner three years ago ( I was more scared than anything) Mike went out of his way to find me afterwards, handing me covered leftovers.  I tell them how I inexplicably dialed Mike the night of my father's passing. "Can't hurt," I joked with my friends who held me up at my father's deathbed. I told them how Mike called me back fifteen minutes later. How he told me that he had said prayers and how he had phoned several other Bahai's in the area and that they had said prayers of passing as well.  I told them about how apprehensive I was and still to this day overall scared shitless about my mother ever finding out about my spiritual propensities.  "My mom has all the virtues down. She's on a baptist binge. The only thing that would really occlude her from ever seeing what I see is the jargon. The lexicon."  "The kingdom will not come by expectation....The Kingdom of the Father is spread out amongst the land and men do not see it." Gospel of St. Thomas  What a blessing to have found this! All this!!! To still find it every day, all new, inside, so lovely.  As I waited for Mike in the student center of the college I work for, the school that has milked my emotional mettle; the school who this weekend becomes amicable host to middle-age men in polo shirts and glasses, their nametags drooping down from their necks; their junior-high daugters experimenting with hair-dye and crushes. As I watch the masses slink into the atirum, toating backpacks and brief cases, ferrying smiles, forming a gentle trainwreck outside the cafeteria, I could feel it, COULD FEEL IT, palpably tugging inside my chest, a feeling of fathomless warmth skidding down from my neck, coating my entire flesh with an impenetrable golden slant; a feeling of union. A feeling of timelessness, a feeling of oneness, a feeling of plurality-- we are just at the dawn of something both mystical and practical and we are witnessing the glorious rise of the global orb together. What a blessing to have been chosen. What a blessing to have been found!

      Just wanted to send a shot of gratitude out to my friend Chrissy --she's one of Swissy-Missy's main girls-hence the obvious 'sy' connection. I was feeling really downtroden and depressed this morning (mostly after looking at my check) and then, who appears, viola, blithe, light hearted, mercurial ray of sunshine Chrissy.  Thanks girl, you splashed a shot of sunshine on my day. Oh, and sorry about the trampoline joke.

      Zipping my way into craggily conciousness. After I lost my contacts in my Mom's blue ribbon award winning&nbsp;weed-bin last week, I endeavored to blindly frisk the landscape in idle&nbsp;search&nbsp;for my visual assets. No such luck. Ended up with an horrific case of Poison Ivy instead&nbsp;that I've successfully scratched&nbsp;the hell out so now it looks like I have second degree burns, little oily&nbsp;scabs,&nbsp;festering volcanic archipelagos dotting the inside of my&nbsp;arms.   "Didn't you ever hear 'If it's three let it be?'" Said my mom to me last night, while I was busy&nbsp;baptzing my limbs in hydrogen peroxide.   "If it's four, roll&nbsp;one more." I nasally-&nbsp;slur wobbling my head, pretending to be stoned. My mom always swipes her head like a stunted windshield wiper, insinuating that above all things,&nbsp;I'm foremost&nbsp;incorrigible.   Even though&nbsp;my limbs are almost always&nbsp;adorned in long sleeves or slacks, the coated rash seems to be&nbsp;quite conspicuous. Exactly six patrons&nbsp;have already&nbsp;stared&nbsp;at me with tilted chins&nbsp;and vexed&nbsp;cubist expressions as they&nbsp;continually inquire, "What happened to your arm?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "Leprosy." I say. "Last time I ever skinny dip in the nuclear&nbsp;dells area&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Illinois River."   I even&nbsp;had one guy, a purported physcian or something,&nbsp;grapple my wrist like he was going to plop down on one knee and propose. He scrutinized my unctuous pond rash, looked at me, offered a grainy smile and then turned around briskly. He then walked off without offering assesments or closure&nbsp;, holding his&nbsp;head very erect and high,&nbsp;like a Marine&nbsp;inching his last&nbsp;chin-up over a bar.   "Oh this. I don't know. It was an anniversary present from my ex-wife. She's a scratcher and she sometimes bites&nbsp;during certain lunar cycles."   I used to get what I would justifiably&nbsp;classify as 'Writers Welts'....I&nbsp;would hunch&nbsp;my upper body like a question mark&nbsp;over&nbsp;my smith-corona&nbsp;and furiously&nbsp;peck out bread crumb sentences, hoping to&nbsp;mix a metaphore amd successfully bake a solid image&nbsp;in the process. Sometimes I would chain-smoke (ahhhh...the glorious smoker era)...I would get these Quazzimoto&nbsp;styes, my eye would flap into its skull and tumesce to the size of ping-pong balls. It was like a cocoon or an Indian Mound was brecching out from my socket.   The emergency room always gives me antibiodics. My landlady Clare always asked me if I got hit. My art teacher&nbsp;purposefully&nbsp;huffed out&nbsp;his&nbsp;sentences like a Rockey movie and then requested the name&nbsp;of the unfortunate&nbsp;Apollo who I apparently mauled.   And my Mom, of course, is just like whatever. I should have told her it was a mark of cain or something.   "Welt? Rash? I don't know what you're talking about."   One of the things that imminently&nbsp;attracted me to the&nbsp;beauitful-fool in the failed&nbsp;Swissy-Missy&nbsp;campaign was that Melissa (her real name)&nbsp;was born a triplet with a distinctive birthmark on her face. The way she explained it, half her face looked like the infield of a minor league baseball park. It was like a cratered mole which she had laser surgery to rectify the facial&nbsp;impediment.&nbsp; If you look closely at&nbsp;the porcelain edges of her face, you can make out the remnants from the laser suture. I always told her that I loved looking at that fracture of her forehead becasue that made her who she was....it identified her. It only added to her beauty. It was like looking at an actual Claude Monet and finding his inky signature dawdled in the&nbsp;bottom corner of the canvas.&nbsp;  "Yeah, I know my arm kinda looks like an aerial view of&nbsp;Long-Island during the&nbsp;apocalypse. Thanks for verifying something so painfully&nbsp;overt."   I remember Missy telling me that, what was hardest with regards to&nbsp;her face was that when she was getting her hair done or lounging at a day spa,&nbsp;one of the older workers would come up to her and be like, "Sweetie what the hell&nbsp;happened to your face?"   "That, I dunno. Probably gangrene. Here, why&nbsp;don't you lick it and find out what it does to your tongue."   Then there was&nbsp;my boy&nbsp;Razdawg....coolest cat you ever seen in your life. &nbsp;Razdawg has elephanitis, which means that&nbsp;one of his legs looks&nbsp;kind of like an axed trunk, something out of which&nbsp;a very irked Lorax would hatch.&nbsp;Razdawg&nbsp;mechanically scoots&nbsp;around in this red wheel chair. He kind of looks like retro-late seventies variation of&nbsp;Steven Hawking with Lipton tea&nbsp;colored skin, a bushy afro and a cool black jacket.&nbsp;The first time I saw RazDawg I couldn't help but stare forever at the sight of his leg. A&nbsp;stuffed club; a&nbsp;granite trunk leaking from his torso in&nbsp;a pendulous dinosaur fashion.&nbsp;After a day of knowing him, it was soemthing I hardly noticed anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;   "Need help." I first said to him last summer, when he whizzed into the library. He couldn't&nbsp;fit his landrover&nbsp;&nbsp;at the computer station, so he sat down crosslegged on the carpet. I&nbsp;went and found a cushy chair&nbsp;he could lounge on to feel more comfortable. Razdawg just looked up at me, a quizzical grin strched between his lobes.   "Bro, I been doin' this shit my whole life." He said, taking a generous breath and using my arm as a rail to uphold his weight.   Razdawg began to frequent the library. He would stop by my desk shortly after&nbsp;opening and offer me a what-up.&nbsp;If he needed help&nbsp;getting in and out of the restrooms he would let me know. Whenver there was an obstacle or a physical hurdle he wouold smile and say, "Bro, I been doin' this shit my whole life."   He'd also tell me all about his girls. Apparently when he wasn't in the library he was out "gettin' some."   "Man those girls down at the Underground last night, all I can say is....damn." Razdawg told me one morning, in my cubicle, his hair slightly tousled.   "Do&nbsp;all the girls down there like guys in wheelchairs." I say, grinning,&nbsp;taking generous a.m. swigs from my Starbucks cylinder.   "Shit, bro..." Razdawg said. "You know all the girls down there be all over me because they think that my leg is..." Razdawg stopped, looked down into his elephantis-riddled appendage. "Well...you KNOW what all&nbsp;the girls be&nbsp;thinkin' my leg is."   He blushed. I volleyed a smile in his direction. It was the only time I had ever heard Razdawg casually&nbsp;mention his handicap.   *   "I don't know what happen to my arm. Here, why don't you examine my choice finger and tell&nbsp;me what you see,"   *   Eventually Razdawg became somewhat of a nussaince. He made it a point to purposefully&nbsp;apply the breaks to his wheel chair and ogle the backside&nbsp;every female that lugged their backpack past him.&nbsp;No one else&nbsp;in the library wanted to be seen sitting down next to him, so I was often called in to remind him&nbsp;that incessant on-linepornographic viewing was illegal.   "I know man but I was just trying to&nbsp;check my e-mail and it popped up."   "It's all cool&nbsp;Razdawg. You know it doesn't bother me. Just don't view it here."   "Man, it just popped up! How they gonna say something to a&nbsp;brother who's&nbsp;just trying to write his mom&nbsp;an e-mail when 'this' pops up."   "'This' &nbsp;looks a lot like Tifany Taylor." I said. "I never knew your Mom was Miss October."   "That's misses October now, she's married."   "Turn it&nbsp;off." I said, placing a palm over my lips to conceal my smile trying to pawn off coifed americana&nbsp;professionalism&nbsp;as I&nbsp;walked&nbsp;back to my carrol, Razdawg muttered his way into complacency.   "Yo-kay. y0-kay, yo-kay. Get all upset at a brother just cause he's trying to be a good son and say hi to his mother every once in a while."   This was August 2003. I had been living with Uncle Mike for about four months although I was hardly ever home becasue I was always working.&nbsp; I had a killer August, devoting myself to ten single space pages a day for my novel. I would start writing at 8 and have around six solid pages at noon, and continue to chisel out sentences into the nocturnal hours.&nbsp; At the end of every day I would print out the pages and save it on a different floppy. At the end of every week I would seclude myself and try to figure out what direction the narrative engine was chugging.&nbsp;One week I was betrayed by a co-worker (a co-worker whom I had taken to the emergency room a week earlier when he had sparined his ankle in a pick-up game). Suddenly the whole office was agog with gossip, concerning a faculty member I briefly dated.&nbsp;I yelled at my co-worker walked outside, bought a forty ounce for Todd the Bum who spent last summer&nbsp;living undeneath Swords Hall and continued to march home in disgust.   At the corner of Bradley Avenue and Institute, I loosened the silk albatrose around my neck and saw Razdawg shuffling in his wheelchair. A small baby carriage toated behind him, like a circus caboose. I immediately walked over to him.   "What the hell."   "Bitch says I got start taking responsibility for my actions." Razdawg says, steering his caravan down the center of the street.   "Here," I said, unbuckeling the baby carriage from behind his wheel chair. There was a six-week old&nbsp;child with beautiful mocha skin.   "Is this yours." I inquired to Razdawg, pushing the carriage.   "Y'igh guess.' He said, very nonchalantly, headed towards the library.   "What's his name." I said, glancing between Razdawg and his progeny.   "Hell if I know. Hell if I ever see him. Bitch just said 'here'. Said she was going&nbsp;out of town and that I gots to start bein' more responsible with my life."   We headed back to the library. To this day the irony floors me. All my co-workers are gossiping about my love life and I walk in ferrying a child in a carriage. Unbeleivable.&nbsp;   *   "Oh what's this. I don't know. I was in chemistry class this morning and I must have confused the coffee with the hydraulic acid. Pretty soon my entire face will look like this. It's a good thing you're attratced to me as a person."   *   Razdawg continued to verbalize his advances and unbidden&nbsp;libidinous desires towards any female who strutted past him. A&nbsp;female student&nbsp;walked up and admired his kis and he would start calling her baby&nbsp;asking her where she had been all of his life. I would&nbsp;get called out two three times a day to&nbsp;remind him that&nbsp;viewing porn was not acceptable on our computers. He would smile and tell me that he wa just trying to check his e-mail.&nbsp;   "Another Razdawg complaint, Dave. Go over there and talk to him."&nbsp;Fellow boss Drea would tell me&nbsp;several times nightly.   "Drea, he's personally harmless. He's benign. He's not gonna hurt anyone. He's just&nbsp;got a whole lotta love."&nbsp;   "Do something." Drea deemed. "Everytime I walk over to him he just stares at my boobs and says "damn" and talks openly about my ass. Plus I can't stand the sight of&nbsp;that god damn leg. That's personally offensive to my vision. Can't he just have that amputated or something."   "It's not like a boob job Drea." I specifically remember getting pissed at her for talking about Razdawgs leg like it was a serperate from his body. "I mean, how owuld you feel if that was you, if your body turned against you like that and you couldn't even govern the taxing growth of your own limbs."   "He could still govern his tongue and you need to talk to him again, I think he's looking at porn."   So of course, I went. Out of my twenty or so co--workers I was the only one who wasn't afraid to go near him.&nbsp;Razdawg recognized my enervated&nbsp;gait as&nbsp;I lumbered over to the computer lab. His lascivious grin morphed into an austere hyphen and he swiftly began clicking the&nbsp;mouse pad.   "Razdawg, whatcha doing?" I said.   "Shhhh." Razdawg&nbsp;vertically&nbsp;positioned his pointer fingers up to his&nbsp;face. with his free hand he offered a few more clicks. he then pointed to his child.   "He's sleeping." Razdawg said. "Isn't he beautiful."   I held my breath. Drea was tapping her foot at the circulation&nbsp;desk, waiting for me to&nbsp;lambaste Razdawg.   "You know bro, I was pretty drunk and I don't even know if the kids mine, but, damn, he sure is precious."   I nodded me head. I slapped him on the back before returning to my post.   "Did you tell him this is his last warning?" Drea asked me.   "Yeah," I said, lying. "I told him. I told him this is the last time before we called the police."   *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "Rash. No. Let me tell you something, I'm a human being&nbsp;who is only&nbsp;renting out&nbsp;a body suit&nbsp;for a terse&nbsp;period of time.&nbsp; Do you wanna know what I'll look like in fifty years? In sevety years for sure? I'll look like little grains of soil. I'll be dust. Everything that I ever&nbsp;paid such meticulous attention to when I stare in the mirror in the morning&nbsp;will be wedged into a little rectangle and planted--physically planted back into the earth. That said, why the hell are you&nbsp;looking at me like that? Is that all you can see?   *   "The Campus police want to talk you." My boss said. It was ten in the morning, and I had already finished page siz of my daily quota.   "Why," I ask.   "They want to ask you about Raymond Tissler.&nbsp;Apparently he has a little bit of a history as well. I've been telling you this for months."   "Sorry," I say staring back at my heaped paragraphs.&nbsp;"I don't know anyone by that name."   "Sure you do," My boss said. "You&nbsp;of all people know him."   "Raymond Tissler? Not a clue." I said, returning to my work.   "We finally threw him out last night. You know ass-hole&nbsp;in the wheel chair&nbsp;with the fucked up leg." My boss said, just like that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I look at my boss and remain silent. I go and talk to the police. After they are done interrogating me I over hear my co--workers chatting. They might as well be clinking champagne. One of them says, "Thank God we got him out of here. I couldn't stand the sight of his leg."

      In the very early-eighties, when I was a shin-high innocuous eyed snotty nose little moppet who was just learning the Lord's Prayer prior to the alphabet, Mom would buckle me into the car seat of our mackerel-flavored station wagon as she guzzled around town attending errands. Wedding snapshots framed from August of '72 show Mom looking like the daughter of a mafia "He's-a-freind-o-mine" bussiness mongrel. Her skin was graced with a gentle olive tint. Her black licorice hair was one long exotic drape skiing down her back. Mom was a Lutheran elementary school teacher and was on loan from Conocrdia Riverforest doing her student teaching in Peoria,  where she met my father.     God love my old man. He wore black framed glasses and had a mop of curly black hair. Sometimes he sported a thick beard (he would have accelerated reading contests with his kids at school and if they read a certain number of books, Dad would volitionally shave his beard in front of the whole school!) Dad was thirty when I was born and was twenty-four when he and mom married. They were married exactly 29 1/2 when he died.  Dad was gangly and goofy. He was modest. He spent thirty years teaching fourth graders. He led the class in AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL every morning. He would get offended by vulgar language and televised nudity.  Instead of saying the word "shit" or "damn" when he was emotionally irked, he'd say the word "crow".The only time in my life I can ever remember my father crying was two weeks before his death, it was the day he was diagnosed with cancer and I snuck back into the hospital after hours to see him.  It was maybe nine at night. Dad was in his bed. He told me very calmly not to worry. He told me that he had his faith. He then asked me to hand him the phone. When I did he tapped in the number to his school secretary and told her that he would have to take a week off.  That he was sick. She was concerened and kept asking dad what was wrong. At that moment Dad's face just fell apart in tears. I think he knew that he was going. I think he knew that he was saying goodbye to friends and co-workers. That he was saying goodbye  to the three deacdes of students.  Dad then gave me the phone. I told him that I loved him and he told me that he had his faith. Told me that he'd be fine. He then asked me a favor.  "I need you to take care of your mom."  *   Rather than Lee or Wranglers, Dyslexia is the pair of jeans both my father and I share. Every time you see a 'teh' typo, know that that's how the word 'the" appears in my head. When I was a kid and was maternally mandated to rinse my germy paws off before dinner, I always told my mom that I washed my hands thoroughly with LAID-or DIAL soap.   Not bad for a five year old.  My dad always wanted to write. He often would submit editorials to the Urinal Jar (Journal Star, Peoria Newspaper). The coolest thing my father did growing up (although I didn't appreciate it until my mid-twenties) was that he read to his children. Every night after dishes, dad would prop open a literary tome compliments of scholastic books and read to his three children--doing all the voices. To this day Dad's indelible Dawn Treader raspy-pitched Reepicheep ranks only second to his perfectly-peeped Lloyd Alexander curious-voiced Gurgi. Everyone loves a Gurgi because Gurgi " loves crunchies and munchies."   Dad would adjust his weight in the old rocker we refurbished, toating his voice back and forth, sawing ideas and sculpting stories into fledgling mindframe of his young students. At the begining of every night Dad would always do what he called an "instant replay," He would read teh (or "the") final paragraph of the previous chapter. Hs kids would offer typical pre-adolescent grouse.  "Dad you already read that."  Us kids would point out in a nightly anomolous squeal, all to anxious for my father to finish reading so that we could have our indivualized ideas uprooted compliments of the 'one hour' of mostly public television we were allowed to watch everynight.  "I know," My dad would say, clicking his tongue in his mouth for suspended affect. "It's time for a little, In-stant Re-play."   *     I've been thinking about my dad because Booma Jaspers who works at teh (the) University bookstore handed me a poloroid this morning of my family in the very late seventies. It was an easter egg hunt at my old church. My face was unblemished and inocent and I bore alter-boy bangs. I am in the center of the picture holding my easter egg basket, looking curiuosly at life through the filmy-yellow poloroid tongue that emits from Booma's face.  My mom cut her hair while I nested in her womb and growing up, she almost always wore a kercheif. My Mom is pointing at the spring soil like she has never seen grass. My father is holding my sister. He is down on one knee, fixing her outfit. He is wearing a cool-retro style hat I have never seen before.  "Dude man." My friend Nick the writer told me this afternoon when I whipped out the double-decade old print.  "He certainly looks like a man of charachter."

      Still no luck with loans (or vision)...plus EVERYONE at work&nbsp;are&nbsp;acting like&nbsp;royal dickwads today.   Oh well,&nbsp; donned the black-leather and orange facial apartus, sucked in my "gimp"&nbsp;pride and sent out submissions last night. Bottom of the ninth. Bases loaded, and Dickwad is throwing me a curve.

      I both look and&nbsp;feel like I just went several rounds with Muhammad Ali in his prime. Strutted ever so--confidentally into the financial aid office today, feeling like I had my whole entire corpus of my cusped&nbsp;literati&nbsp;offerings cheering me on in the pell-mell&nbsp;behind the striped&nbsp;ropes. Nope. Got a financial TKO in the first round. Ouch. That has to hurt. Got up. Spat out blood disguised as financial burden. Motioned with my gloves to bring 'em on. I apply for an alternative loan.&nbsp;The butterfly floated ever so gingergly. The bee injected it's venomous syringe with an indelible sting to the jaw. I can't remember if the canvas of reality propped up and smacked me in the temple or if I was simply planted into the center of the ring, the taut&nbsp;soil of the&nbsp;canvas slowly transitioning into a corpse;&nbsp;&nbsp;a wan colored cone crowned my defeated aura like a dunce cap. The crowd continued to pelt out invectives. My equilibrium tottered and slid.&nbsp;I heard the Ref. (whose head,&nbsp;in this scenario&nbsp;resembles&nbsp;Michelangelo's nickel-bearded God)&nbsp;splayed his arm like a&nbsp;toll-both and gruffly beagn to&nbsp;work his way up to ten. I realized that several of my teeth were missing. I looked into the audience and saw the&nbsp;girl of my dreams wearing a low-cut denim skirt and sitting on the knee-cap of my best friend. I saw little cukoo-birds&nbsp;fluttering into a collective&nbsp;halo above my head&nbsp;and whistle out failure. Once again, I heave myself up from the base of the my adversaries trussed boots. I spit.&nbsp;Vertigo has sliced my opponent into three, so now Mr. Ali is the trinity. I don't know which one to hit. The voice of God slices my carousel&nbsp;concentration and beckons me to "fight".&nbsp; Log on to Citi loans.&nbsp;Engender a password with uppper case font. Submit my drivers license and&nbsp;yearly income.&nbsp; Submit multiple phone numbers. Submit references.Submit desired amount of loan needed. Swing my arm the direction of the&nbsp;smudged opponent. Swing again. I&nbsp;think about my father and rememebr him telling me&nbsp;in the formative big-glasses little-league era that&nbsp;&nbsp;it didn't matter to him if I struck out as long as I struck out swinging. As long as I firmly grappled the steel baton and&nbsp;took an earnest heave&nbsp;at the bullet&nbsp;sphere hurtling in my direction. As long as I swung the bat, as long as I put myself out there, it didn't matter if I circled the bases in glory or ignominously&nbsp;lumbered back to&nbsp;cold&nbsp;socket of the dug out pinned in adolescent&nbsp;agony--all that&nbsp;mattered&nbsp;was that&nbsp;you swing the bat,&nbsp;and that you physically swatted&nbsp;everything that is inside you and emptied yourself over home plate. That's all that mattered.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The&nbsp;red sentence&nbsp;pops up&nbsp;as if it were kept in a music box,&nbsp;denying me access.&nbsp;I see the&nbsp;red gloss&nbsp;of the sucker punch before I am gulped into unconciousness.&nbsp;As if underwater I hear the ref&nbsp;wade through prime numbers until he reaches double digits. I am considered the loser. I speculate where my best friends paws might&nbsp;have migrated.   But no. I don't give up. The match is officially over. I spit. I can't see straight. I've been hit more times than a joint at woodstock and all I can say is bring it on!!! Is that the best you have to offer. Come on! A ring isn't something you place on your finger daily to remind yourself of a palsied promise; it's a place you live inside of. It's a place you never leave.   And Michangelo's God just looks at me like I'm crazy. Like I'm nucking futs. Like I'm a dervish drooling adages no one can spirtually intuit. Like I'm the devil. Like I'm completely crazy. Like, even though I've been pelted down, I still want to continue to dual, feeling that, as long as I can savor any morsel of consciouness, I am immortal.   Three right clicks and two cigarettes&nbsp;later, I found another web page. Another loan. It looks promising. I&nbsp;buy books prematurely for class. I blogg&nbsp;defeated woes. I think about how it feels to be depleted, to get knocked down on&nbsp;your ass, to watch your best friend grope the perfect palm of the girl who scatters your dreams with sugar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   And how you look out at them only you can't see them. You've been hit too many times. You've been cut&nbsp;open and every one can see your every bruise. Your every minor&nbsp;welt.   You still refuse to go down for the count. You still refuse to go down, to go down without a punch. To go down without swinging.&nbsp;

      "...Orpheus was so sad about the loss of his love that he composed music to express the terrible emptiness which pervaded his every breath and movement. He was so desperate and found so little else meaningful, that he decided address Hades. As the overseer of the underworld, Hades heart had to be hard as steel, and so it was. Many approached Hades to beg for loved ones back and as many times were refused. But Orpheus' music was so sweet and so moving that it softened the steel hearted heart of Hades himself. Hades gave permission to Orpheus to bring Eurydice back to the surface of the earth to enjoy the light of day. There was only one condition--Orpheus was not to look back as he ascended. He was to trust that Eurydice was immediately behind him. It was a long way back up and just as Orpheus had almost finished that last part of the trek, he looked behind him to make sure Eurydice was still with him. At that very moment, she was snatched back because he did not trust that she was there. When you hear music which mourns lost love, it is Orpheus' spirit who guides the hand of the musicians who play it...."   -The story of Orpheus and Eurydice, as told by Thomas Bulfinch.&nbsp;   I've been thinking a lot about the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice lately, mostly because these last two weeks, I've been visually&nbsp;dampened in darkness (Hades), trying to fish my way out using my own voice. I've been shuffeling through old songs, spelunking through&nbsp;caravans of expired thought,&nbsp;padding through&nbsp;Pandora's lingerie drawer in search of a gift from cupid, cannonballing in the Thames,&nbsp;holding my breath under waterfalls, counting to ten. I've been frolicking around&nbsp;Eden's playground, afraid&nbsp;of being&nbsp;slapped by pliable wrists, afraid&nbsp;of being&nbsp;tagged and eternally&nbsp;addressed&nbsp;as "It," in a locked halcyon&nbsp;garden where Knowledge is&nbsp;forbidden and naivete is treasured.....   The myth of orpheus&nbsp;creeps open in my daily&nbsp;narrative.&nbsp;After trudging through the bowels of&nbsp;our own individualized rendition of Hades, after&nbsp;lowering&nbsp;ourselves, limb by staggering limb&nbsp;into a foreign milieu in order to retrieve that "beauty" which was once ours, that vision of possibility we once caressed,&nbsp;forever tersely; after bartering with Satan, after feeling my beloved's breath against my neck for the first times in years&nbsp;and spending seemingly endless months 'ascending', out of patched darkness and into&nbsp;the&nbsp;refulgent diadem of light,&nbsp;&nbsp;after, &nbsp;just when the&nbsp;golden atmospherical&nbsp;socket of reality&nbsp;is starting to herald the promise of pulchritude-- what do I do? I look back&nbsp;and perenially&nbsp;lose the grasp of my&nbsp;reward.....&nbsp;   Alright,&nbsp;I hate&nbsp;feeling sullen. I'm trying to accumulate enough confidence&nbsp;in myself to strut confidently into Swords Hall tomorrow&nbsp;(where My Grandma worked for over thirty years) and beg for more money next semester....of course I'll get it, that's what student loans are for....  Part of my sour health stems from a time when I refused to 'get further in the hole' and insisted on working multiple jobs&nbsp;full time to support my academic habbit.&nbsp; Looking back, cocaine would have been far&nbsp;less taxing to future&nbsp;credit bureaus.   I should feel more comfortable. The last two times I've requested funds the 'brother' (ahem) who is in charge of that department invited me over to his house for dinner, telling me that when he was my age, he never missed the opportunity to&nbsp;eat a free male...(smiles)   Money is&nbsp;such a weird thing. You're pretty much screwed if you have it and screwed if you don't. College is probably the worst financial&nbsp;investment&nbsp;an eighteen year old currency-dependent americanite&nbsp;can toss themselves into. I went to a horrible, simply awful highschool (where of course, if it wasn't so bad, I wouldn't have started writing) and monopolized a $1000 scholarship on a girl (Thank you Before Sunrise--of course, having your wayfarrying&nbsp;heart butchered at dreamy 19 is simply mana from heaven in terms of literati-experiences; it all but makes you immortal. I felt like Jack Kerouac when I got home).&nbsp;   Things are looking better...when I'm not off&nbsp;sulking I can write an ok tune and I've been told by other prof's that I'm&nbsp;virtually guaranteed a free ride into certain MFA programs, which makes me feel happy.....   The real&nbsp;gift (considering&nbsp;the loan goes through, which of course, it will) is that, this semester I have&nbsp;the opportunity(for the first time ever)&nbsp;to be a FULL TIME COLLEGE STUDENT.... I can study and write full time without having to&nbsp;scan bar codes and&nbsp;make change behind a cash register or working til four am everymorning&nbsp;and cram (or bullshit) exams...I'm so thankful for this opportunity........fifteen hours of class and less than twenty hours a week of work!!!! It almost seems unreal!   Now, if only I can get myself to swords Hall.....&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Burning up&nbsp;both ends of the workaholic candle and&nbsp;I've&nbsp;completely incinerated&nbsp;the wick&nbsp;prior to&nbsp;sopping up all&nbsp;the wax. Still in my incubating period where the world is a steady accumulation of hawked smudges and feigned blurs. Met a beautiful&nbsp;young writer this morning who has seen me everywhere and&nbsp;who I once again do not remember ever having&nbsp;met. She told me that she saw me at RAVE last night and I said no, informed her that I hadn't been to a hard-core rave in like&nbsp;five years,&nbsp;relayed to&nbsp;her the whole scenario about having tryadic-male ponytail&nbsp;duplicates roaming&nbsp;all over town and then (duh) remembered that the theatre Mike and I went to last night&nbsp;to see Bourne Supremacy was called Rave! Duh.&nbsp;Daniela, myself and&nbsp;arya seem to be different rungs on the same spirtual coiled&nbsp;DNA strand&nbsp;and whenever&nbsp;I accumulate the gall to inform&nbsp;Uncle Mike about the 'plurality' spawned by our cyber-rapport&nbsp;he just looks at me like&nbsp;double-duh, his eyes&nbsp;little pekowskies behind his spectacles, telling me that's the way it's suppose to be,&nbsp;and&nbsp;it's our own individual ego that projects spiritual universality into being&nbsp;a big deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Maybe it's not a big deal but it's nice when it happens...especially nice considering how commercially posh and globally&nbsp;accelerated our planet has become in such a short period of time.  One more week of farsighted nausea.&nbsp; Ever since my father died suddenly (misdiagnosed cancer as Chrommes disease) and I was misdiagnosed a week after his death&nbsp;( I had a broken foot, they&nbsp;diagnosed it as&nbsp;gout) I've totally despised going to clinics. Hate it! It's like your wheeled into the planet&nbsp;under the hard-lights, ammonia&nbsp;scented tiles&nbsp;of the hospital and then&nbsp;they wheel you back in while your wizended with some disease that could be cured only all our funds are being siphoned to riddle other nations with wounds.....Screw it....I'm a realist....Just think what our country would be like if they would show our own citizens suffering every night on televion.....victims of cancer and HIV...Can you imagine president Bush holding up a heavily fonted&nbsp;newspaper headline saying WE FOUND A CURE.....optimist ( or at least a visionary)...yes....yes, but I'm also a realist. If we can genetically clone a&nbsp;mammal, we can cure diseases that&nbsp;have been&nbsp;proven to have&nbsp;been&nbsp;deployed as&nbsp;weapons of mass detriment&nbsp;already planted&nbsp;here within the borders of our own nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;  My danders shot up cause I'm exhausted and can't see. Today's the birthday of my youngest sibling Jenn (23) as well as "YOU-SO-CRAZY-DAVEEEEEED" Jasna, (24). Jasna sent me a poem a month back to which I emialed her the address of the short-story I previously&nbsp;blogged.  She hasn't written me back since.

      After following the ticklish tug of the feathery-voice last night, arriving home for a long over due, any decade-now-you-can-get-some sleep (but why sleep if you have freetime)... I found the house flooded with bahai's....my personal narratives seriously plays host to a lack of intrigue and surprise&nbsp;b/c either one of two things will inevitably&nbsp;occur. A.) Swissy-Missy will inexplicably&nbsp;show up with&nbsp;boyfriend in tow and say something to me, only&nbsp;a visual handicap hinders me from connecting fully with her or B.) Something straight out of the blogg will manifest itself, from the square canvas of the computer to the corporeal canvas of&nbsp;creation, &nbsp;spirit disguised beneath the winged creature&nbsp;of voice and breath. I haven't seen Swissy since earlier this week&nbsp;which means -bing bing bing bing bing-Bee is the correct answer.   Meandered home completely drained, optically-addled and fatigued. Mike sort of slapped a Welcome Matt for the entire human race at our doorsteps...he initially&nbsp;unearthed the faith through a cool couple with door knobs culled straight&nbsp;from&nbsp;Denny's&nbsp; (they were always open)...so now our hut&nbsp;serves as a little&nbsp;spiritual safehaven where people come over&nbsp;and chew the cud of their travels...(Uncle Mike tried to have all this new age "relaxing"&nbsp;crystal music playing but I told him "Enough with the damn&nbsp;Rivendale chimes, alright.")&nbsp;&nbsp;   Last night Gary was talking about the time of the he met the Guardian's wife&nbsp;in Maryland where he also mentioned a certain&nbsp;dwarfish, golden rhetorical-voiced professor who held a certain Baha'i chair and I'm nodding my head, assenting, like 'whatever" and then...hmmmm.....I wonder....&nbsp;   Mike also has a bootleg (although I've yet to hear it)&nbsp;of this particular&nbsp;prof. chanting THE FIRE TABLET.   For some reason (My hardcore JK ROWLINGS predeliction... her&nbsp;lucid&nbsp;prose and enchanting persona deems her the sexiest Childrens writer of all time) everytime I think of the World Peace Conferance I picture it as being a spiritual Hogwarts Haven (b/c daniela's terra ferrma is magical) with eccentric-eyed professor's&nbsp;and enlightening lectures sculpting malleable minds...Maybe once arya returns, she'll remember to&nbsp;bring me back home&nbsp;a broomstick.......   &nbsp;&nbsp;

      The&nbsp;world is still a cloudy fingertip swirl. Human beings have transitioned into blurred banners with&nbsp;dissipating limbs.&nbsp; My chin protrudes almost a&nbsp; whole foot closer to the staticky&nbsp;canvas of the computer screen, stamping my forehead with an anvil-heavy headache come days end. The&nbsp;keyboard is littered with twisted alphabetical insects that keep leaping keys.&nbsp;Contacts are en route, but I'm revelling in my incubation period--a time when I have to squint to see clearly, a time when both my wit and acuemen&nbsp;are not&nbsp;as keen. A time to allow the emotional chunky creative&nbsp;field inside my chest to fallow and&nbsp;fertilize and eventually harvest.   I was shuffling through the latest edition of National Geographic today, reading an article about the thermnoclear hearth known as the sun:   "By big-time galactic standards, our star is quite undistinguished. Sure, it's so huge that a million Earths would fit comfortably inside. And it's so dense that the sunbeams you see today began their journey from the center of the sun before the last ice age, taking hundreds of thousands of years to elbow their way out to the glowing photosphere before making the 8-minute, 93-million-mile (150-million-kilometer)&nbsp;trip across space to your eyes."   I was rustling the pages when&nbsp;I realized that I've always had a hard&nbsp;time&nbsp;looking at&nbsp;photographs of our snug solar generator....even on television. If I see a&nbsp;close-up of&nbsp;the sun beaming&nbsp;on NOVA&nbsp; I feel like my eyes will swell and pop into refulgent glorious blindness.   I wonder if this fear, this apprehensive of being close,&nbsp;so close to&nbsp;the actual generator of the&nbsp;light is what stymies my own proximity with a godhead? Is what thwarts me from harnessing the reins of my creative stagecoach and whupping the dream carriage into an eternal gallop?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Of course, I'm sure I'll be able to see clearly once my lenses arrive. There is no way in hell I'd live to see double digits if I were living in this continent three-hundred summers ago and had to tacitly depend on my sight for survival....how the hell I am going to spot and target a bison when I have a hard time making out my shoe strigs?   *   Previous siblings who have shared bunks with me in the formative toddler era&nbsp;are well aware&nbsp;that I'm the most ticklish lad alive. I make elmo&nbsp;squeals sound&nbsp;&nbsp;like an aria. When I was a no largder than the size of a fire-hydrant Doctor visits were hell because everytime the nurse practitioner would thump down on&nbsp;the hollowness of my&nbsp;lower stomach, I would immediately&nbsp;begin to jowl in screeches.&nbsp; My sister Beth (also the biter)&nbsp;would lash out her pointer finger in the direction of my abdomen from across the room and I would end up writhing in feigned titillating tears. She wouldn't even touch me, she would just point.   To the menatlity of both my Mara and my achilles,&nbsp;this psychological tickle&nbsp;wand is still quite efficient toady, as my crazy sister 'Blabber-Mouth "thanks for telling mom about&nbsp;the pot brownies" Beth is well aware of&nbsp;.   "Oh, Dave, look. What do&nbsp;we have here? Under my hand. Oh, no--could it be our little friend."&nbsp;   Beth brandished her pointer finger across the holiday table in my direction. I&nbsp;errupt in laughter.   "Oh, no, Dave. Look at our little friend. Don't you want to play with our little friend?"   Somehow (?) Uncle Mike found out about my pointer-finger phobia (pointophobe). Uncle Mike just got royally screwed over by our last landlord and,&nbsp;as a creative retort, I engender this weird morbid soap opera titled WHO KILLED MAXIMILLIAN ZERVO (the name of our&nbsp;Italian ex-landlord).   During the last months, while we were moving, I would always commence with my WHO KILLED MAXIMILLIAN ZERVO schtik whenever we would move a rolled carpet or burrow boxed of books into a trunk of the car. Could Maximillian's&nbsp;body be in here? Everyone's ia suspect." I say, like I was talking about awounded&nbsp;J.R. in the mid-eighties.   "Stop that."&nbsp;Michael would always scoff at my mawkish humor and then one day,&nbsp;out of nowhere...bam....Michael orhestrated his pointer finger in my direction and&nbsp;quickly slashed&nbsp;a&nbsp;crisp slice&nbsp;of air and the next thing I know I am wailing with laughter.   Guess the concourse has a cookbook of lunar-&nbsp;phobias they&nbsp;allow only the finest participants to peruse.&nbsp;   &nbsp;I also keep hearing that feathery-&nbsp;tickled voice brushing off the&nbsp;still-life dust&nbsp;motes&nbsp;inside&nbsp; my chest. The voice tells me to write. To write all the time. To not worry about what anyone says (let them worry about there own mock masterpieces) but to pour myself on to the contours of the page everyday, as much as I can. That feathery-tickle voice tells me to write for the school paper this pending semester. It tells me that I should read all ten of the course books for my modern fiction class in August (and&nbsp;peck out synopsis and possibly paper outlines for each) and concentrate on my senior projects, grad school applications, killer short stories and smooching with Hollywood pell mell in my&nbsp;screenwriting class that I take via LA&nbsp;satelitte.   The feathery voice also told me to sketch a docu-drama about william miller and call it THE KINGDOM WILL NOT COME BY EXPECTATION.   "You'll do a good job because you'll be divorced from it." The little sparrow voice chirps.   The title of the docu-drama is culled from a quote from Jesus&nbsp;from&nbsp;the (historically versacious)&nbsp;gospel of St. Thomas.&nbsp;   (And this is a pending Joseph Campbell exegesis so watch out)   In Mark 13 the Christ's disciples inquire about the end of the world in terms of an prophetic red-calender apocolyptic&nbsp;event.   "Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.   Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away. "   Well that generation came to pass and the end of the world did not arrive so this passage was traditionally intuited as a mataphore...as if Christ was talking about the 'race' of mankind as a wgole.   In the Gospel acording to St. Thomas, the disciples inquire of Christ the same query, to which Christ responds:   "The Kingdom will not come by expectation. They will not say "see here" or "see there".&nbsp;The Kingdom of the father is spread out&nbsp;upon the earth and men do not see it."   People of a cultivating earth-is-one-country-and-mankind-it's-citizen&nbsp;thread of spiritual sight no exactly what that passage means......   the key&nbsp;is of course, to pen a docu-drama that doesn't&nbsp;proseltyze, but one that shows an earnest man assiduously digging inside his chest for answers.....    The feathery-voice is telling me that I've been lodged in the library for almost thirteen hours and that maybe, a nap would be nice&nbsp;   (smiles)  &nbsp;-Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.  Luke 17:21

      &nbsp; And the concourse smiles...they smile and they laugh and they huzzah....Uncle Mike, who has powers from Lord knows where and is a&nbsp;door-matt in terms of humility, cracks a porcelain&nbsp;smile when he&nbsp;chats about the concourse.  "Humor seems to sometimes&nbsp;be more important than physical&nbsp;health."&nbsp;He says, slipping a grin.  Wrote a long blog this morning&nbsp;that was expectorated by blogger into the dregs of cyperspace. I was ranting about a poetic contemporary who really, vehemently, detested my&nbsp;writing.&nbsp; She would leave the room when I would read. Be casual and curt in conversation. That sort of thing.  &nbsp; Not to be so. Yeah, too much bitterness in the world already....encourage, encourage, encouarge people to follow their joy...to milk their potential into dietary&nbsp;gold...  Someday I'll blogg a story about how arrogant, hoolohoop egoistic&nbsp;david ruined a budding&nbsp;girls career. I was literally Salieri to her Mozart (every time I stuck my tongue in her mouth,&nbsp;it was green&nbsp;with envy)....she was gifted, truley gifted in a cannonical, timeless&nbsp;sense...  My greatest foible was not realizing how sweet the music we made together sounded.  &nbsp;

      Even though Captain Ponytail Holder was RUTHLESSLY shot down&nbsp;by a capitalized&nbsp;LAME&nbsp;missile compliments of&nbsp;the villainous duet of&nbsp;Mara-Arya and Lady Benzedrine&nbsp;associates (smiles- as they hi-five each other) his legacy still thrives and his panache and superhero antics are widely emulated over the sleek-top&nbsp;skyscrapers of burgeoning bloggervilles everywhere.....  &nbsp;  "Look, up into the Heavens. It's a bird. It's a plane. No, its a.....ponytail holder?"  (A look of a mass confusion widely&nbsp;melts disappointment&nbsp;across the faces of all&nbsp;mankind.)  &nbsp;  "Honestly, Who were you expecting? Christ's&nbsp;already returned. So has Shrek."  &nbsp;  You think Uncle Mike is crazy, you outta hear about the&nbsp;shenanigans of his non-baha'i mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For&nbsp;reason's Uncle Mike&nbsp;hasn't quite explained yet, he was seperated from his mother at a young age and grew up with his grandparents. He was reunited with his mom in high school&nbsp;where she had an additional family.&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncle Mike's mom was crazy, creatively&nbsp;rash and spontaneous--kind of like her son, who at sixty-two, after entertaining&nbsp;&nbsp;a life fraught with spiritual sugar cubes and&nbsp;enriching&nbsp;inward discovery--he still Beeps the car horn when I walk in front of&nbsp;the Linocoln (even when my hads are full)&nbsp;and laughs as my body transitions into a startled&nbsp;exclamatory mark. Last week he scorned the&nbsp;wrath of his born-again Bush-booster right-wing Christian nuke-'em-til-they-glow-and-shoot-them-in-the-dark&nbsp;co-workers by issuing the following joke.  &nbsp;  "How many born again Christians does it take to change a light bulb?"  &nbsp;  "None, they're too busy trying to save it."  &nbsp;  "Mom used to love playing jokes on the Chinese&nbsp;foster kids." Uncle Mike told me explaining that she would always take their least favorite food and&nbsp;camoflage it into a casserole and then&nbsp;instigate a dinner-table conversation and then&nbsp;laugh as she would hear her Chinese students grouse about how much they&nbsp;detested that particular&nbsp;food&nbsp;while they were simultaneously munching on the abhorred substance.&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mike's mother&nbsp;had a&nbsp;question&nbsp;for a politician or an astronaut, she'd write them a detailed letter and expect a response and then write them again to remind them who she was and usually invite them over for dinner if they were ever in the area (she once invited the Oak Ridge Boys over and they came). If she wanted to know how&nbsp;some machination operated, she'd march herself down to the foundry and inquire a tour.&nbsp;Mike has stories about his&nbsp;senior&nbsp;mom going to St. Louis to&nbsp;visit an&nbsp;X-rated theatre ("She wanted to know what the fuss was all about.") Painting a&nbsp;Volkswagon&nbsp;Rabbit the color of the American&nbsp;flag for the bi-centennial. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  "We never did find out if Mother made it down to the nude beach of not." Uncle Mike claims with a smile.  &nbsp;  Last night Uncle Mike was wearing a&nbsp;very tastelessly tropical Hawaii-five-o shirt that his mother had given him.  &nbsp;  "Are you wearing that for your work evaluation tomorrow?"&nbsp; I said, being a smart ass. Michael started humming Jimmy Buffett tunes.  &nbsp;  "Mother bought this shirt for me." He said.  &nbsp;  Shortly before his mother died, Uncle Mike remembers her tossing up pennies into the air like ionized New&nbsp;Year's Eve&nbsp;confetti&nbsp;and watching them clang and&nbsp;scramble&nbsp;to a halt in a parking lot in Southern Illinois.  &nbsp;  "What on Earth are you&nbsp;doing?"&nbsp;Uncle Mike said in the same exaact manner that he says to me when I'm trying to resucitate my moribund&nbsp;staionwagon with clamps, forgetting if it's positive to positive or positive to neagative,&nbsp;leaning heavily towards the attraction of polar&nbsp;opposites.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;"I'm making you smile." Uncle Mike's mom said, hurtling up an open&nbsp;umbrella fountain of loose change.  &nbsp;  "What on earth do you mean." Says Michael (when he's fuddled, he always swears on the planet).  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"When you were a litle kid, you found a penny in a parking lot and you smiled. It was the happiest I've ever seen you. So, I'm making you smile."  &nbsp;  In addition to always&nbsp;getting a bubble-gum from the transparent globed&nbsp;bubble-gum machine every time we eat at either Steak-n-Shake or Dynasty Buffet, every time Mike spys a penny in a parking lot, he scoops his lanky frame over like he is attending a loose shoe string and picks up the penny.  &nbsp;  "Mother's been here." He almost always says, with a crackpot grin.  &nbsp;  Thus the origins of Captain Ponytail holder. Since Mara-Arya and Lady Benzedrine are currently clinking tepid&nbsp;shots of Wheatgrass over his coffin, I'll take it incumbently upon myself to eulogize the late-Captain Ponytail holder *sniff*  &nbsp;  Captain Ponytail&nbsp;Holder was born in&nbsp;Paris, France&nbsp;around Bloomsday&nbsp;1994. This was the trip that a&nbsp;young,unfledged grasshopper&nbsp;named Mister D&nbsp;met a cool Italian dude with long hair and strong-oily Body Odor who looked exactly like Slash from Guns-N-Roses. The Italian rocker didn't speak any english and Mister D&nbsp;doesn't speak much Italian outside of occassionally&nbsp;ordering ersatz side entrees from the Olive Garden,&nbsp;so the two dreamers&nbsp;communicated in what little French they both knew. The&nbsp;Italian rocker introduced a sixteen year old&nbsp;Mister D&nbsp;to Marlboro&nbsp;Reds and red wine and Italian women. He was there when Mister D got ignominously slapped by a french girl because he told&nbsp;the girl&nbsp;that his real&nbsp;name was B.J. (although he used the non-acronymic term for a southern hemispherical&nbsp;"aeolus employment") and the french girl went the entire&nbsp;evening addressing Mister D&nbsp;as non-acronymic B.J.&nbsp;--to which he replied with an almost Frat-boys giddy&nbsp;drool of "Oui-Oui" upon hearing his name spoonfed into his earlobe by a beautiful french girl who was twenty-four (B.J. also lied about his age. He was twenty-two and studying history at&nbsp;William Jewel&nbsp;outside of Kansas City)...and everything&nbsp;between B.J. and the docile-eyed french girl was moist rose pedals until one of the french girls friends voluntarily&nbsp;took the time out to explicate&nbsp;en francais what the non-acronymic Bee-jay actually stood for and right then and there, in the middle of a discotheque, Mister Dee was mercilessly&nbsp;slapped and the music skidded on the record player and a very cinematic ensuing silence&nbsp;flooded the dancefloor and when the french girl&nbsp;swiftly&nbsp;performed a 180&nbsp;and muttered something about stupeeeeed american boys Slash walked up to Mister D with a cigarette&nbsp;lit rambling terse&nbsp;staccatto Pepé Le Pew&nbsp;&nbsp;phrases in english like:" To really Love a woman and then to lose her, even then, is to REALLY LOVE a woman...."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  When I arrived back home from europe a few weeks later&nbsp;I canned the aerosol cylinder of Aqua Net (so much for the early nineties&nbsp;Parker Lewis dew) and boomeranged my&nbsp;comb into the trash can, only dad refused to have a hippie living&nbsp;in the house.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"It would be disrespectful to both your parnets and to&nbsp;God if you&nbsp;grew your hair&nbsp;long and got&nbsp;your ears pierced." My dad told me, on our front porch, when&nbsp;I&nbsp;developed the pictures of my Italian friends and pointed to Slash, informing my father that that's how I want to have my hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to tell him to hush. Even though he had&nbsp;graduated from college in '69, dad&nbsp;was from the era of Leave it-to&nbsp;Beaver butch cuts and&nbsp;brylcreem. Besides, after three tries I had finally passed my Driver's License test and Dad had just gone to the hardware store and made duplicate keys&nbsp;to his car, which if course,&nbsp;entailed imminent post-adolescent freedom and Friday night emancipation&nbsp;with&nbsp;(hopefully) soon-to-be ditzy&nbsp;sophomore cheerleader Angie Shufflebein stationed&nbsp;in the passengers seat beside me.  &nbsp;  "But Jesus&nbsp;had long hair. And we're suppose to be just like Jesus." I said, trying to plead my case,&nbsp;not realizing that this would offend him.  &nbsp;  "Jesus also did allota walking too, son." My dad said, offering a&nbsp;crisp&nbsp;Holiday-like jingle from his pocket as he sipped his coffee, rolled up the&nbsp;Tribune up into a&nbsp;baton and went inside.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I heeded my dads advice. I got a haircut every three&nbsp;weeks. During 1997 I had a permy-haired&nbsp;girlfriend who insisted that I get a haircut weekly. Our relationship was an intense (god was it intense) ten-month long lightswitch.&nbsp;As far as the mythological&nbsp;sub-categories of "boyfriend" and "girlfriend" were concerend, we&nbsp;were either "on" or "off" and sometimes we flickered incendiary shadows&nbsp;in the same day.   &nbsp;During this period my close&nbsp;friends could tell if I was dating or single simply by judging the length of my bangs.&nbsp; Jana, my girlfriend, was my age but was also my co-worker and BOY, talk about Blackmail.  &nbsp;  "You didn't realize that we have video camera's in the back room...and you're&nbsp;my supervisor?&nbsp; What if&nbsp; you leave me and I miss you and decide to&nbsp;post pictures of us&nbsp;on-line?" She said one day, after we broke up again, in all earnestness, smoothing down the sides of&nbsp;her skirt.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I broke up with Jana the day I kidnapped the purported love-of-my-life, the proverbial "one-that-got-away" Miss&nbsp;Vanessa.&nbsp;I haven't been inside a&nbsp;barbershop since I first held the porcelain smooth&nbsp;slant of&nbsp;Vanessa's palm and slipped inside her mouth and her&nbsp;world&nbsp;on October 1st, 1998.&nbsp; By then Father&nbsp;I think had adopted mother's view of her prodigal&nbsp;son&nbsp;and perceived me as a 'lost cause'--and his arguement about "Maybe God just doesn't want you to be a writer." still stings tears of loss to my eyes even today.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Three times in my life I've endeavored to grow a&nbsp;turf-lumberjack thick beard and three times I have failed. The first was&nbsp;when I sqaundered my collge savings and scholarship&nbsp;on a girl named Megan and flew up to Appleton WI. I came home, the inisde of my chest and the inside of my bank account were broke and I&nbsp;knew my Dad still wouldn't allow his son to grow&nbsp;long hair, so, to espouse the vagaries of my droopy heart, I did the only practical thing and decided not to shave.&nbsp;Too much Before Sunrise&nbsp;does not in any way auger well for "practical"&nbsp;romantic trajectories....then of course, who want's to have&nbsp;a&nbsp;'practical' partner complete you for eternity here on earth?&nbsp;Hell if I do.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;When I met Vanessa&nbsp;I decided not to do anything with my face at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kissing you with a beard is like making out with a cactus." Vanessa said.  &nbsp;  Instead of thickly coned-homages to the Amish race, I grow little facial&nbsp;nests&nbsp;resembling abandon Little League fields. The first time I took that timeless drive down the thick country arteries of the Manito Black, tolling through Forrest City (two Silo's and a trailor tavern) kicking off the Black on to that dirt road that rustically&nbsp;sprints into the buccolic&nbsp;country&nbsp;bouquet&nbsp;called Topeka, where&nbsp;I fell in love and sadly&nbsp;hurt a butterfly&nbsp;innocent girl with long blond hair and a glossed hyphen smile.....that first time (and everytime I made the&nbsp;Manito Black sojourn from Peoria to Topeka)&nbsp; our opposite&nbsp;hands clutched into an embryonic human heart, I rolled off the dirt road, helped Vanessa with her laundry bag. After the obligatory handshakes and introductions from Mama and Papa Bear (and Nosy Aunt Debbie Bear who had 'just happened' to drop by) I was offered an ICEHOUSE and walked inside. Just then, I would find out later in our rapport,&nbsp;Vanessa's&nbsp;aunt turned to her mom and, in a cusped&nbsp;whispered concerning my swirled-whiskers candidly&nbsp;commented, "What is all&nbsp;that shit he has on his face?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;From&nbsp;the Bohemian mecca of&nbsp;Paris, to a little town&nbsp;so-fraught with white trash you'd run outta twist ties&nbsp;if ever you'd try to bag it up, the late&nbsp;Captain Ponytail Holder slowly came into fruition.&nbsp; It took a year for my hair to sprout off, for my tresses to droop. At my cousins wedding the next June&nbsp;my hair was a cross between Christian Bale staring as Laurie in Little Women and that of a fashionable Knickerboxer.&nbsp; By the time Vanessa left me,&nbsp;after living in both Heaven and Hell for thirteen consecutive&nbsp;moths (and a partial purgatory ever after) my hair was pony-tail length, a snub handle protruding from my occiput.  &nbsp;  "I made you." Vanessa said, her fingers lost above my forehead, offering out a little smile, shortly before&nbsp;she rightfully&nbsp;left.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a long time the rule was that if I wanted to be inside my parents house I had to keep my nutmeg-colored&nbsp;hair pulled&nbsp;back in a ponytail. In church it was essential (or else the little pentecoastal flame that appeared during prayers&nbsp;would be hidden).   &nbsp;My hair weas always expected to be pulled back. For Christmas every year I would get pony tail holders from both my sisters. I love having long hair (all&nbsp;wandering lads&nbsp;should have long hair at least once in their lives)&nbsp;and certain psychoanalysts have suggested that long hair is an emotional vestigial of the brain...like a waterfall of unbidden thought gushing from the top of your skull.   The&nbsp; Christmas before my Dad died he made me an offer: Cut your hair and I'll give you the mini-van.   I LOVED my parents mini-van. They bought it so&nbsp;Beth and Jenny could ferry their classical instruments all throughout the midwest.&nbsp;It would have been much more domestically commodious and accesible an abode&nbsp;to crash in a little over a&nbsp;year later, when I was living in my Station wagon.   But no, I refused to cut my hair. I kept my hair&nbsp;knotted back at family functions. When&nbsp;my dad was diagnosed with cancer January 18th of 2002, I vowed that if he lost his hair I would shave my skull and, on the back, get a Tatoo that said, quite bluntly FUCK CANCER. But I never got the opportunity. Dad&nbsp;had two rounds of chemo in one week&nbsp;and then capitulated&nbsp;his earthly vessel to the heavenly waters.&nbsp;He hadn't shed the&nbsp;least bit of hair.   The day of his funeral I had my hair long when my&nbsp;Sharon Osborne sexy&nbsp;aunt from Canada (she's my third cousin)&nbsp;handed me a ponytail holder.   "Here," She said. "It's what your father would have wanted."   *   Thus captain ponytail holder died a happy death. Being cyberly-asphyxiated by the smooth&nbsp;paws of Lady-Benzedrine and Mara-Arya isn't at all a&nbsp;bad way to go, allow me to assure you.&nbsp;Captain Ponytail holder died with&nbsp;a he-who-lives-in-the-moment-and-is-continually-flanked-by-two-beautiful-cyber-Vixens&nbsp;smile stitched into his lips.   But&nbsp;I can't help but to reminisce over Captain ponytail holder, thinking about Uncle Mike&nbsp;scooping up&nbsp;loose&nbsp;change claiming that his mother's presence is all around him, claiming that mother is&nbsp;still here, painting smiles on his face....I can't help but think of Captain&nbsp;Ponytail holder, who yes, did in his terse lifetime bear a flaccid name, when I leave the library with my hair&nbsp;in tortured tangles and looking down, I spot an errant ponytail holder and I&nbsp;briefly reflect&nbsp;about how my dad always approved when I&nbsp;kept my cinnamon tresses pulled back into a handle on the back of my head. Perhaps,&nbsp;as is the case with Uncle Mike's matriarch, he wants us all simply&nbsp;to smile together.   (smiles)&nbsp;&nbsp;   *&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      The Cubs were beating St.Louis 8-2 in the second and now it's the top of the 9th and their down 10-8!!!!!! WHY!!!!! BEING A DEVOUT CUBS FAN ALL MY LIFE HAS ADUMBRATED ME FOR FAILURE!!!!! &nbsp; When my boss Sam inquired why I remained so adamant a CUBS fan after all these years I told him it was like getting married. &nbsp; &nbsp;"&nbsp; At first you used to&nbsp;circle the bases every night and even take the game into extra innings and a post-season honeymoon at Disney World was inevitable. And now....I'm lucky if&nbsp;she'll let me step up to the plate without calling a foul ball on me first." &nbsp; Just checked the score again. Now it's 11-8, in favor of the cardinals.&nbsp;

      Monopolized the entire weekend anchored in chores. I cleaned out the gutters and pulled weeds&nbsp;at the center. I planted geraniums and cleaned out the pool&nbsp;at Uncle Mike's.&nbsp;I went to my moms last night and mowed her lawn and endeavored to&nbsp;gnaw through the little&nbsp;slice of Amazonian rainforest that&nbsp;has become&nbsp;her backyard. The concourse's been laughing more than it's been smiling these days. Just when I'm pretending that I'm&nbsp;butchering the lorax by toppling over a dead tree, low and behold, iorny of ironies, I swat at the beaded&nbsp;row of&nbsp;sweat&nbsp;drooling from my forehead and 'plop', into the jungle of tumbleweed and poison-ivy,&nbsp;there goes my last contact. The world is a cartwheeling&nbsp;dessert of fingertip swirls.&nbsp;I can see neither screen nor keyboard this morning and my head keep on drilling like someone is mining for oil on the top of my skull.  &nbsp;  -and to compound matters (once again, when I'm nearsighted) Swissy-Wishy-boy-did-i-strike  -out just walked in with her botched beau in paw&nbsp;and gave me a little girlscout wave with her free&nbsp;wrist...   And the only pair of glasses I can find are an errant pair salvaged from the Lost and Found shoebox.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Crazy cycles.&nbsp;I'm well aware that as soon as this "fog" lifts I'll be a verbal locomotive wielding words and images. This is the mist before the morning. A time when my body is waking up, ready to accomodote the thick shafts&nbsp;of morning light.&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally this is the time when&nbsp;Captain ponytail&nbsp;lad appears, but of course, his heroic&nbsp;red-s antics&nbsp;were maliciously&nbsp;emasculated by the sleek,&nbsp;devious duo&nbsp;of Mara-Arya (who has&nbsp;kick-ass cool&nbsp;hair but smells like a brewery)&nbsp; and Lady Benzedrine (who thwarted the escapades of an itinerant, peddling&nbsp;baker who, once again, mistook the hash for the oregano)....last time my Clark Kent&nbsp;blogg's from a phone booth.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Being optically stymied isn't as bad as it sounds. I hung out all morning with tangible&nbsp;blurs of fellow writers Nick the Writer and poet&nbsp;Shannon. Shannon told me that my favorite intown poet, Staci L., has a glass eye and I NEVER would have suspected that.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  "So&nbsp;THAT's the reason she kept that&nbsp;one eye opened when&nbsp;we kissed."&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, trying to be funny, only no one else was laughing.  &nbsp;  The blessing was that, after I lost possesion of my sole cyclopic lens, I was coerced into crashing at Moma Bear's pad last night which gave me ample time to sift through most of my storage, mainly thick blue airtight tubs fraught with&nbsp;books. From roughly 1995-2001, the years when I decided that I was either going to live in literary stardom or burn-out trying to flicker ALL I DID WAS BUY BOOKS. I worked for many years as a Supervisor for Barnes &amp; Nobles which means that I could get my paws on any title very quickly and take a hefty bite out of&nbsp;the barcode&nbsp;with my discount. I came home weekly with heaps of books and half a paycheck.&nbsp;I craked open many of the caskets last night and found my old Autographed copy of Ginsberg's HOWL. I found Vonnegut and rick Moody and Carole Maso. I found David&nbsp;Markson. Found all the plato, the William James&nbsp;(FOUND&nbsp;MY FIRST EVER COPY OF WITTGENSTEIN'S TRACTATUS!)...found&nbsp;my old ARTIST&nbsp;Way (which made me think of daniela) and managed to gut all the stuffed&nbsp;envelopes where I daily stowed my morning pages into the morning trash can.  &nbsp;  I&nbsp;found four different versions of INFINITE JEST, Two&nbsp;different versions of ULYSSES and GRAVITY'S RAINBOW, one BEING and TIME and a&nbsp;near mint condition SPORTS ILLUSTRATED cover&nbsp;salvaged&nbsp;from '98&nbsp;that shows vintage&nbsp;Michael Jordan in the clutch over Karl malone....the last shot he ever swished&nbsp;in a&nbsp;firey-bloodshot Bulls jersey.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I found&nbsp;the thousands of poems I kept from high school for some reason, chronicles of feigned angst ( and you&nbsp;insist that the breweries exhibit an offal, noisome stench--I should post some of my old manuscripts on line&nbsp;but I'm afraid I can't simultaneously&nbsp;distribute enough&nbsp;laundry-pins to staple shut the nasal passages of those with keen taste).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I combed through an old box of bills (how did I ever survive those years?) and, while playing&nbsp;&nbsp;envelope frissbee golf&nbsp;with expired&nbsp;late-fee notices, I found (TCS) wadded up in what looked like&nbsp;a hybrid&nbsp;of a&nbsp;little oragmi pyramid and a paper airplane with&nbsp;one elongated limb....BAM....the original program&nbsp;from Greenlake '02, with you-know-who's name&nbsp;dotted&nbsp;inside.... good luck on your pending&nbsp;classes! &nbsp; Even more weird&nbsp;I later found a letter from my mom written on JULY 18TH 1977...exactly 27 years to the date!!! July 18th is my Baptismal date. In the letter, mom asks for the Lord to cintinually bless me.......... and it looks like he has.

      I think that's how we're living...couldn't sleep last night.&nbsp;Revceived a late&nbsp;phone call from a dear and special friend who took me under his masculine wing and&nbsp;shepherded me through some rough times a few years back and it was such a joy to hear from him. Said the prayer for the departed for Juliet Thompson, who was a bohemian baha'i who wrote the book I, Mary Magdalene.&nbsp; Three years ago, when I first met Mike, he'd invite me over to his house and have me read outloud excerpts from Juliet Thompson's diary, smiling to hismelf when I'd verbally butcher the persian.  &nbsp;  Juliet was good friends with Kahil Gibran and there's a little story about Gibran not accepting the Baha'i faith b/c he could not imagine that there was anyone "greater" than Abdu'l-baha...  &nbsp;  The world is&nbsp;still a swift&nbsp;blur which is healthy. As far as my cyclical nature ensues, whenever a transition in my life takes place , thumbing to the next chapter of my on--going autobiography so to speak, everything kind of smudges together, wads into a global nearsight and then unfolds in perfect stain-glass&nbsp;symmetry. Happens every time.&nbsp; My emotional mettle&nbsp;transforms into a creative&nbsp;zygote that eventually evolves to the next rung. The next pillar.  &nbsp;  And of course (the last two years esp---over exerting my health by always working)&nbsp; the&nbsp;frequent&nbsp;insomnia&nbsp;serves as a&nbsp;spiritual needle&nbsp;stiching&nbsp;patches of my life back&nbsp;together. I'm reliving my father's death. I'm raking up my sins and&nbsp;foibles into a bushel of yesterday, dousing the leafy heap&nbsp;with&nbsp;fuel and striking a match. I'm trying to become the person I feel&nbsp;like I'm perenially suppose to be. I've realized that, even if your piss-poor in America, you still have it far better off&nbsp;than over ninety-percent of your sibblings&nbsp;globally dotted across&nbsp;this little solar island called earth. This&nbsp;tidy home of ours, a welcoming matt for the soles (souls) of the future,&nbsp;with dwindling ethnic&nbsp;obstructions and a cultivating spiritual linearity.  &nbsp;  And yet we're still here. Still ensconced in the blurred moment. Still falling in love kicking and screaming, like a newborn, pushing way out, learning how to breathe, how to suckle, how to crawl and eventually....how to&nbsp;give.&nbsp;

      Just visited with Mara's dyslexic double. After blogging an entry about experiencing disappointment with an older "intellectual" crowd at a young and formative age, I bumped into my dear friend Mary. Mary's a formative, exceptional artist. She's been teaching at the college level for a couple of years (even though we both graduated from high school the same year)...Mary has a gentle, brushstroke smile and a thick stream of very-arya-assenting thick black hair that slinks down her back and tugs at her waist. She's taught art in France and is applying for a position in Florence. I'm so proud of her. Out of all of my bohemian friends shes the one that I'm most certain will have a dip with the baha'i faith.   Mary and I tersely dated around the time when I was working 24-7 (which was most of the last two years)...we had a few nice moments together and I feel blessed that I didn't totally botch things up. Over coffee Mary thanked me for calling her on her birthday when she was outta state having surgery, an event which I still can't remember doing, but her gratitude made me feel special.  As Uncle Mike continues to remind me, "When a relationship doesn't work out, it's sometimes a blessing for both parties." It's true. Occasionally you have to prune and hem the bush if you want to cultivate the garden. and (unlike 80 % of the participants in the previous blogg) I feel blessed that I can admire mary as an artistic contemporary rather than as a couple.   Although I never said it when we were dating, I'll say it now...Proud of you baby. Can't wait to see what notes you'll continue to paint in the hearts of all your students, as well as in the artworld

      Just like I have an unobtainable, insatiable&nbsp;fascination and mystical rapport&nbsp;and with female goddesses whose first name ends in the letter 'a'; this has been a&nbsp;week laden with "ly"-adverb first name girls. Beautiful&nbsp;Ally, a very dear friend gave me her phone digits (i didn't have a pen/paper on me&nbsp;so she pulled me over on the side of the road and in a very observant&nbsp;Mrs. Woolson fashion watched as I memorized her digits and then forgot them later on during the day--d'oh!)...My friend Nelly just left, who, (geez-David) came up to my work desk and knew my name and knew all about me and I had to squint because she looked vaguely, somewhat a tad&nbsp;familiar&nbsp;but I honestly can't remember ever meeting her before&nbsp;and when I honestly&nbsp;confessed to&nbsp;her all this she smiled and said that that's what I always say to her....which means that (according to&nbsp;her) we've had&nbsp;the conversation about me-not-remembering-her-name-and-trying-to-be-all polite-and-professional-about-it a total of three times over a two year period....  &nbsp;  Also&nbsp;uncanny and weird&nbsp;is that there are precisely three&nbsp;individuals slacking&nbsp;around the&nbsp;Peoria area who look EXACTLY like me. Think&nbsp;Conrad's Secret Sharer. Think Doppleganger.&nbsp;We all sport pony-tails,&nbsp;scurry around town&nbsp;in an awkward gait and have very angular and gaut facial features.&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncle&nbsp;Mike was skirting around town this morning when he&nbsp;swore he&nbsp;saw me in a coffee shop only I was at home asleep. My sister thought she saw me downtown walking out of a strip club last week when I was in Chicago drooling over Julie Delpy's unblemished performance&nbsp;in Before Sunset. I've had (bona&nbsp;fide) girls that I Know I've never met come up and yell at me, addressing&nbsp;me as&nbsp;either Chris or Matt.&nbsp;When I was twenty-two I went to City Hall to pay a traffic violation and was (!) arrested and interrogated for over and hour because I looked just like&nbsp;a low key drug assalaint.&nbsp; I was&nbsp;sequestered by P-town's finest in this little&nbsp;room in the basement and I made the very&nbsp;inopportune&nbsp;mistake of using the word "kafkaesque" to the police chief&nbsp;(new word of the day, next to "epiphanous") and then had to define the word Kakaesque which entailed a&nbsp;verbose&nbsp;synopsis of who&nbsp;Franz Kafka was&nbsp;as well as a book-report&nbsp;of Kafka's "The Trial" where the protagonist&nbsp;of the short story is arrested, tried, convicted in front of a jury and eventually executed (gulp) for a crime that he has no clue he commited; a crime whose exact nature therof is NEVER explained to him.  &nbsp;  Needless to say, after&nbsp;I submitted my bookreport to the officer&nbsp;he&nbsp;sounded very much like my friend daniela&nbsp;when he declared that I was "too smooth" and cuffed me and pelted me with querries, barking invectives and vulgarities in my left earlobe until I was deaf. Finally, after an hour, they said I&nbsp;was clear and could go and they&nbsp;showed me a picture of the assailant and it turned out (?) I knew the lad--a&nbsp;hippie journalist by the name of Matt--&nbsp;and turned him in.  &nbsp;  The police Thanked me, offered me a donut, but refused to assuage my $75&nbsp;speeding ticket. Bastard Pigs!!!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;Chris is also my in townie twin.&nbsp;He's almost exactly ten&nbsp;years older&nbsp;than me and he's&nbsp;the son of a well-known&nbsp;contemporary psychoanalyst. What's even more bizarre is that&nbsp;we've split a total of three girls between us (only one of them-- Vanessa--the love of my life who I've yet to blogg b/c the heart still measures her as a fairy tale butterfly-angel--name&nbsp;ends in 'a').&nbsp; I've met Chris a total of three times. When I&nbsp;transfered schools four years ago Brook, my then girlfriend and a psych-prof, told me that she was "in love" with someone who looked just like me but was her age and I&nbsp;immediately had&nbsp;and inkling it was devious-toothed&nbsp;Chris, who&nbsp;used to salivate like a Pavlovian-chiuaua over Vanessa. While Brook was two-timing me with Chris, Chris also had a fiancee whom&nbsp;he was two-timing with Brook. About a year after this torrid tryst occured I met a girl named Cheryl&nbsp;at a RAVE who told me she was in town for a few days&nbsp;from Netherlands (she spoke what I thought was perfect dutch)&nbsp;and in the immortal words of Ben Affleck in CHASING AMY&nbsp;we "SHARED A MOMENT" plural and then a week later I saw Cheryl (who I thought was supposed to be&nbsp;back in Europe at this time) walking hand in hand with Chris at a&nbsp;swanky furniture outlet filling out a bridal registry and she pretended&nbsp;not to see me when Chris scowled&nbsp;and I'm like, "Shit!" at the whole situation and because I'm a blabbermouth the next time I saw crazy-Brook I&nbsp;boasted&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;her about&nbsp;my terse&nbsp;encounter with Cheryl and Brook (the so--called professional) went out of her way to contact Chris--even though they hadn't spoken in a year; even though Chris had "shattered" Brook's heart (while I thought Brook was being "faithful" to me--whatever that means these days -I was faithful to Brook-)...and&nbsp;Chris was so infuriated with Cheryl that he called off the wedding and then Cheryl&nbsp;found out&nbsp;only then about Chris and Brook and&nbsp;once again,&nbsp;Peoria's finest were called in to&nbsp;mediate the situation. Which today I still find 'sick' b/c duplicitous&nbsp;Brook, Chris and Cheryl are REALLY brilliant, intelligent human beings who&nbsp;grade college kids on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;think and they&nbsp;were running around town&nbsp;then in their early-thirties acting like they just discerned that they&nbsp;have genitals, which, at the time, when I was in my early twenties and I desperately wanted to kick it and socialize&nbsp;with&nbsp;cool people&nbsp;who had passion and intellect--made me even more dubious about so--called 'adults' or even people&nbsp;bearing authoritative positions.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Chris and Cheryl later got married. So did Brook, to someone who had cash and could afford not to pay attention while she continued to fall in love with various students. Which means David only has one more twin to blogg about, his name being Charlie.  &nbsp;  Next to Vanessa (who I swear I'll blogg about one of these days because in terms of romantic stories and human&nbsp;loss--you ain't heard nothing yet) Charlie&nbsp;is one of&nbsp;the most talented writers I have ever met.&nbsp;He conducts prolific&nbsp;fairy-tale Dylanesque songs and he's (sadly) a perfect example of what hardcore...I mean hardcore, drugs&nbsp;can do to a brilliant mind in terms of paranoia and delusion. When we see each other it's like I'm looking in a mirror, only when I scratch my head with my right hand, it appears to be the polar opposite.&nbsp; He quit his job yesterday and I had a dream about him last night.  &nbsp;  That's my weird life in terms of twins. And you thought&nbsp;our blogging rapport was weird.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Nothing like being visually stymied. Mark and I took William and Zachary&nbsp;out to the baseball game last night and of course, William and Zachary and I did the appropriate cultivating future ambassador of "World Peace" thing and wrestled the entire evening which was fun, until, as the adults always say, "Someone gets hurt." Right when I was dropping the twins off William mauled my back and endeavored to remove my wicker cap and inadvertently proded his thumb in my eye-socket hardcore. OUCH! I literally felt like Cyclops for a second and I lost a contact which royally sucks because I'm all out of&nbsp;contacts and with only one lodged in everything in the library this morning looks a tad cubist. And then Mara walks in (only it's not Mara, its a fellow "writerly" friend of mine) and I love her to death only she is actually going blind in both of her eyes and she still writes poems and plays songs everyday and I have never, not even when she is socially imbided, heard her bitch about her dwindling ocular impediment and she's such an inspiration when you see her in the library composing iceberg-shaped stanza's on Microsft Word with the FONT augmented to 36 inch, pelting out sentences like there's no tomorrow and today hasn't started yet while she's still squinting&nbsp;into the screen, and still (God Love her) always beating me in local poetry competitions. I got an Honorable mention certificate I forgot to pick up and then got yelled at by the judges for not taking my budding career seriously while she successfully pocketed a few hundred greenbacks.   So now I can't bitch about my sight. One eye is Yin the other is Yang and the world this morning is a subtle blur of beauty and smudged swirls.   But I still get headaches. Athena was born from the side of Zeus' temple (his head). I feel like she is thumping and working on her future soccer skills inside my skull this morning. I had to come into work early and only got time flush a few shots of "David Death Blend" down ye olde hatch--coffee so potent that I could dab a few drops over my father's grave and watch unawed as he crawls out of his casket and demands a decaf.   Speaking of my father's grave, let me tell you about my beautiful friend Valerie--a gift from the Concourse when I needed a terse companion in a time flooded with windshield vertigo and Picasso-blue-period melancholy. The story's a tad sexist but Val has heard it many times and her face still blushes into raspberry shaded wine cooler and smiles whenever I tell it publically. She's a beautiful friend who's working on her Masters in Civil Engineering and is, as we speak, on her way en route to Munich for Civil Engineering seminars. She's&nbsp;&nbsp;just found the purported love of her life which is cool because he's kind of a "good-old-country-boy" and although Valerie's gait exudes with sexy cosmopolitan professionalism, she's from Dunlap, Illinois, which is a beautiful, rustic Illinois country town where the corn fields and sunsets resemble the cover of Neil Young's HARVEST album:   "I want to live,  I want to give  I've been a miner for a heart of gold.  It's these expressions I never give  That keep me searching for a heart of gold  And I'm getting old.  Keeps me searching for a heart of gold  And I'm getting old.   I've been to Hollywood  I've been to Redwood  I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold  I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line  That keeps me searching for a heart of gold  And I'm getting old.  Keeps me searching for a heart of gold  And I'm getting old."   So here's the scoop.   Dad's underground all of a sudden and I'm working something like 80 hours a week and still not making it and mom's literally showing people pictures of her failed son who wants to be a writer but who is obviously also not very good because none of his short stories are selling.   Then the bomb. I'm homeless, sleeping in my station wagon and using the bathroom at the Ammoco gas station to brush my teeth in every morning and then my Aunt calls me up at work and asks me if I saw the newspaper headlines this morning concerning my childhood friend Mike (I'll omit his last name for privacy sake, but as you can intuit, I have a fourth-dimesional rapport with lads by the name of Michael and David and with lasses whose first&nbsp;name usually end in the letter a).   I grew up with Mike. Used to play "A-Team" with Mike on the Playground during Kindergarten recess (He was "Murdock" I was "Face" Patrick was a feigned fruit roll-up&nbsp;cigar-chomping " I-Love-it-when-a-plan-comes-together," sly-eyed Hannibal. My other friend David was MR. T, partially because he wore huskies). Mike and I both harbored hardcore crushes on Alicia Passages in sixth grade. Mike was bold enough to write her a love letter and tell her how he actually felt. She was a spoiled bitch and read the letter publically to her groupies at Lunch and even asked our grammar teacher if she could place the letter on the overhead to be used as an exemplar when the class diagramed sentences seventh hour.   Later Mike and I would be in charge of our High school Youth group. We would organize church bake sales and car washes. We were in charge of taping the church services and duplicating the tapes to elderly and shut-ins. We went on nature retreats and my greatest memory of Mike was from a week-long wilderness canoe retreat on the Flambeau river in northern Wisconsin. Mike navigated the canoe with perfect jealousy-envy-spite precision. He was capable of spanking whitewater with the tip of his paddle and taming pesky rapids with smooth strokes.   We weren't best friends by any means but for a while we were close. He bought the birthday cake for my 18th "surprise" birthday party on a retreat in San Antonio. He told me the night after it had happened when lost his virginity (sadly, the only 'sin' that is overtly-emphasised to the point of group insurgence in religious circles these days)... and that, when I asked him how it felt, he told me that it was really no big deal. Really no big deal at all.   In high school we were always vying for the cone of the spotlight to blind our juvenile foresight--mostly aiming for the attention of girls. We both had SUV sized egos in an age infatuated with mini-vans. Mike got showered with attention his junior year for precociously accepting an internship at Caterpillar. His face was always in the paper and I remember (weird) that around the moment of his death, thinking about him. I hadn't seen Mike in a few years but for some reason (almost a pluralistic 'duh' now) I was thinking about Mike the night he died. I was thinking about how much I vehemently despised the kid in High school. I was thinking about how much I wish I would have received his reams of public glory and I remember thinking just how pissed off at him I was. I hadn't seen Mike or heard from Mike recently but just prior to his departure I felt him again and I hated him. Abhorred him for being the popular duo. Hated always hearing him talking about himself. Yang upset that Yin&nbsp;was garnering all the accolades.   No, it's weird, because these are thoughts that I hadn't harbored since I was seventeen and, at twenty-five,&nbsp;like layered fabric in winter, they were suddenly all around me and I remember looking at my reflection in the windshield and simply, suddenly, hating Mike, HATING HIM, for inexplicable reasons even though I personally had no reason to loathe him and had not even thought about Mike in a number of years.   I got the phone call from my aunt two days later.   *   It was a grisly death. When I stomped up from the Teacher's Lounge swatting tears from my chin and asked the secretary for the paper she told me personally how 'sick' she felt from reading the account and strongly advised me not to.   Mike had married the girl who had plucked his virginity those years before. They had been married for five years. They had been trying very assiduously to conceive but just couldn't.   Mike had a wonderful job. He had a new home. He had a morgage and he found out three months earlier that, finally, his wife had conceived-- only she was having problems and had to be on continual bed rest. The paper said that Mike had called his wife fifteen minutes before his ill-timed demise and said that he had a surprise for her. That was the last time their two voices would ever touch.   Michael's body, his earthly garment, was literally flattened by a drunk driver whose license had already been suspended twice. I'll spare you the grisly details about how his body was contorted or about why (?) they insisted on having an open casket funeral for him three days later; his forehead puttied up. With Mike crushed, the drunk driver, a twenty year old male, actually sat on the hood of Mike's gashed car, continued to take swigs from his beer and even rolled and fired up a&nbsp;blunt. When the cops arrived the intoxiated male looked at the cops, looked at Mike's carcass and then informed the police, as is documented, with a shameless drunken grin:   "Looks like I'm pretty much fucked."   *   Mike's funeral was packed. It was like a grade school and high school reunion only everyone was dressed in black and looking down into their shoes and bartering rolled kleenexes between themselves. I cut in line and met with Rev. Arthur--who I've always had a bond with. Rev. Arthur had interred my father's body into the earth a little over a year earlier.   The Concourse smile&nbsp;boughs of&nbsp;laughter even when the masses wail tears of loss. Before Mike's funeral I went out and bought a rose. Mike was going to be burried in the same cemetary as my father and I was (finally) trying to accumulate enough emotional gall and courage to look down at that patched heap of earth that enveloped my father's wilted bones, say the prayer for the departed and consecrate my grief.   What I didn't realize was that Mike was to be burried less than fifty meters from where Dad's grave is. The Lutheran Cemetary is huge and gothic and Dad was burried in a very old vector, close to his parents. When the serpentine stream of traffic arrived at the cemetary it was exactly like how I remembered it on my last visit. A hearse locomoting a long train of cars with orange funeral pennants sprouting up from their hoods. A green tent with chairs reserved for the family placed in nearly the same exact&nbsp;locoation it was a year earlier, when my father died when I refused to sit, holding down my mother's shoulders from behind her during the eulogy.   Rev. Arthur was holding up the same bible he had held up a year earlier configuring his sliced palm in the direction of the trinity. It was surreal.   (Here's the point where the story verges from sentiment and gets crazy)   I was reliving my father's funeral, holding a rose, looking at the body of my friend stuffed in a silver&nbsp;rectangle, mad at God that all this crazy shit was happening, upset at myself for always working all the time and never making it. Rev. Arthur's voice is very low and deep and he accentuates certain biblical words so that "GOD," sounds simply like "GO-AAAAAAAD." I was refusing to cry, standing by myself and groping the thorny stem of my rose, when, upon&nbsp;I averting my vision up near the mourners tent, I saw it and could not keep my eyes from staring.   IT WAS THE NICEST ASS I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.   Totally crass, I know. But I'm being totally candid at the same time. Rev. Arthur was conducting the chorus of mourners in the "Our Father" refrain and all I could do was leer and ogle and mentally salivate over the back side of the lady with the short black hair tightly attired in the chic navy-blue bussiness suit. I couldn't make out her face and I couldn't keep my eyes from scoping her out and I almost smiled and chuckled at the overall irony implicit in the situation when the universe of parishioners grumbled and huffed and eventually echoed out an all-too exclamatory "AMEN", which quickly escourted me back to reality, only I was somehow less despondent and even smiled when I looked down into my rose.   The mourners slowly began to scatter. There were hugs and embraces and I strapped on a pair of sunglasses to keep from being noticed. The absolutely last thing on the planet that I wanted was someone coming up me with both my Dad and Mike on the&nbsp;emotional&nbsp;tab, giving me a hug and asking me "Howya doing?" What the hell was I supposed to say?   "Well, I'm fine. I'm now homeless. My mom has all but disowned me.My sisters won't talk to me. One of my old close buddies just died a very tragic death and has a wife who's here in a wheelchair because she's having a tough pregnancy carrying the child he'll never meet and to top things off, I've somehow inhertited this totally tasteless habit where cemetaries have supplanted single bars as a social hub to pick up girls. I'm great!"   And I was. I bullshit nonchalance so well. My Beautiful blogging angel daniela gave me the ultimate compliment a couple of nights ago on the phone by telling me that my voice sounded "rougher" than my prose.   "You mean I sound 'faggy' on-line?" I inquired.   "No," She said, before...................................................................." (smiles)      Back to the cemetary. I walk over to my father's grave. Dad's been dead over two years&nbsp;now and although&nbsp;the school where he taught at&nbsp;erected&nbsp;a beautiful marble monument with&nbsp;a color-picture of him reading to his students, mom still&nbsp;hasn't gotton around to purchasing a tombstone. I locate the tufted mound of earth. I look up and see the flock of black outfits releasing themselved from their teary&nbsp;clusters.&nbsp; I bow my head in reverence and before I can christen the earth with my tightly clutched rose, I see her.&nbsp;Headed towards me. Like she is the sexy girl in the COKE commerical walking in slow motion. There, five steps&nbsp;away, strutting towards me, is the Nicest Ass of all Time,&nbsp;traipsing in&nbsp;still-life-with-a-bowl-of-romantic-ardor-time, by herself, headed in my direction.  &nbsp;  My first thought&nbsp;was fished up straight&nbsp;fr0m the gutter.  &nbsp;  "Attaboy," I say, thinking to myself, thinking myself dapper in my&nbsp;suit. Then I think:&nbsp; &nbsp;  "Shit, she must have noticed me checking her out during the Reverend's eulogy. She's gonna come over here and slap me&nbsp;for being uncouth--ontop of my father's grave no less!"&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The Lady in the Bussiness suit approached me. And before I could mentally massage the oracle of dating coolness and offer a suplication for romantic&nbsp;smoothness her lips beagn to speak.  &nbsp;  "You're David, right? Do you still write books?"  &nbsp;  Turns out she knew me. Heard I was a writer somewhere. I had no clue who she was and honestly do not remember ever&nbsp;meeting her before that encounter. But there she was, the Nicest Ass of all time, who it turned out&nbsp;also&nbsp;posseses a beautiful smile and huge continental heart, standing next to me as I plopped down the rose on&nbsp;top of the pitching mound of dirt that has become my father.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;No, I didn't cry. I was cool. I told the Nicest ass all about my relationship with Mike who it turned out she had worked with for the last&nbsp;two years. I told her all about my father and how suddenly he went. We didn't know each other but we ended up embracing.  &nbsp;  "God love all this damn craziness." I told her. She smiled. When I turned around Rev. Arthur was stomping in my direction.  &nbsp;  "David," He said, smiling so that I could make out his silver&nbsp;dental fillings.  &nbsp;  "You know, I really questioned the will of God when he took your father." The Rev. said after I introduced him to&nbsp;Valerie, the&nbsp;girl whose butt I had been eyeing.  &nbsp;  When the two of them left I reached into the side pocket of my stripped-blue jacket, the jacket that had belonged to my own father, and opened the book of Baha'i prayers.  &nbsp;  *  &nbsp;  Valerie stops in and sees me at work almost everyday. Our relationship is one of friendly-fire flirtation.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was the&nbsp;first to inform me that Mike's wife gave birth without much hardships.  &nbsp;  "It was a girl." She said. "We were all kinda hoping for a little boy.&nbsp;But it was a girl and she's healthy."  &nbsp;  Mike's wife is&nbsp;doing well. Ironically(TCS) Mike&nbsp;applied for Life Insurance just a week before his death.  &nbsp;  Sixth months after the funeral I took Valerie out on a date.  &nbsp;  "It's not that kind of a&nbsp;date." I kept telling her. "I&nbsp;need to tell&nbsp;you a story." I said.  &nbsp;  "A story," She said, a look of budding assentment spread across her cheeks.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I took her out for dinner&nbsp;after classes and, while our&nbsp;cappuccino's grew cold,&nbsp;&nbsp;I told her the story. Told her all about the crazy shit that was going on during Michael's death. Told her about me&nbsp;checking out&nbsp;her "ass" during the Lord's prayer. Told her that I still remembered the color of the&nbsp;outfit she wore. How time fizzled into slow motion when she was walking in my direction afterwards.  &nbsp;  I told her about how&nbsp;I had sentimentally eschewed trudging up to my father's grave and my fingers reached across the table and bit into her hand when I told her that, even though she didn't realize it, her presence there next to me&nbsp;at the cemetary that day was nothing short of the kiss of angel feather's across the weak lips of a boy who was very scared and confused.  &nbsp;  "Whenever you need a friend, you know where to find me." I told her. "Thank you. Thank you simply for being there.  &nbsp;  There was silence. I gave Val's hand a tug and then reached up and took a swig from my cappuccino. The waitress&nbsp;slapped me the bill and I insisted on paying and leaving the tip. As we gathered up our school bags Val turned&nbsp;to me and smiled.  &nbsp;  "So," She said. "Do you still think I have a hot ass?"  &nbsp;  "Sugah, it's got my vote."&nbsp; I said, with a little smile, staring only at her forehead. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

      Pre-Dawn dalliance still serving as a welcome matt for insomnia. Even after two showers and two books, sleep is almost seen as a trangression; a lunar tresspass against my latent urge to spill words into sentences. Perhaps it's b/c, since I officially 'declared' my alcohol blood level has diminished considerably. Finding a devout writer who has a healthy pair of lungs and an unjaundiced liver is like finding a hockey player with a full-set of teeth: A rarity. This is a hard-image for writers to slough because nearly all of our hero's were intelligent, well-read alcoholics. It's like when you are in third grade and you save up money to buy a pair of Air Jordan's (or AIR JORDACHE's, in my case) and you go to the playground and emulate all the moves you saw Jordan himself perform in applauded slow motion on the Highlight reel. You wanna be like those people whom you look up to. Those people who have made it. Go and stare at the literary vignette in your local Barnes and Nobles cafe. When I was a young writer I almost always tuned up ye olde ribbon in my Smith-Corona with a few brewskies first, demanded still-life-with-a-bowl-of-pruned-ego-nourishing-silence and eventually slopped a few paragraphs of indulgent, forgettable drivel onto the page.....and my community (the literary one)...is in DIRE need of writers who don't get manacled to their work and can let go of their ego and their solipsistic/hedonistic urges. The last Christmas I had with my father he gave me an old gray file cabinet. I embellished the side of the file cabinet with cut-out pictures of writers I admire. There was the James Joyces and the TS Eliots. The Ezra Pounds and the Kerouacs, Ginsbergs. J.D. Salinger and a rare blur of Thomas Pynchon. Hawthorn and Whitman (of course) but also Contemporary angels like Carole maso, Dave Wallace, Rick Moody, Laurie Moore, Jhumpa Lahari Franzen and Eugendies and George Saunders. William T. Vollmann and Richard 'I-don't sign-autographs-b/c-I-still-can't-get-over-the-scientific-truism-that-I-was-unpopular-with-cheerleaders-in-high-school' Powers. There were buckeye poetic-eyed photographs of high school slyphs: Anne Sexton, Sylvia Plath...and in the center was a balck-and white nonchalant ciagarette in paw portrait; the godfather of the minimalistic short-story himself, Raymond Carver... A photograph I ripped out of a library book in Normal, Illinois (along with Josesph Campbell authenticated autograph....I know, Thief in the Night...) Carver drank like he was supporting his local aquarium for most of his life and then, in the last decade, he was sober and produced a glut of subtly crafted short-stories and poems--his short stories are by far, arguably, the best of the latter portion of the 20th century. He died when he was just fifty (even though he quit drinking he still smoked something like three packs of cigarettes a day) Here's a poem that was published in the New Yorker just after his demise.     Gravy  by Raymond Carver   No other word will do. For that's what it was. Gravy.  Gravy, these past ten years.  Alive, sober, working, loving and  being loved by a good woman. Eleven years  ago he was told he had six months to live  at the rate he was going. And he was going  nowhere but down. So he changed his ways  somehow. He quit drinking! And the rest?  After that is was all gravy, every minute  of it, up to and including when he was told about,  well, some things that were breaking down and  building up inside his head. "Don't weep for me,"  he said to his friends. "I'm a lucky man.  I've had ten years longer than I or anyone  expected. Pure Gravy. And don't forget it."    Mara disguised as sleep depriven agony. During my second shower a voice kept telling me to put down Sebastian Junger's Perfect Storm and go downstairs, into Uncle Mike's boxed archieve and fish out one of his crazy books. I told the voice to go away. Told it I wanted to sleep. I held up my index, middle and pointer fingers and told it to read between the lines, but eventually (has the topic this week been surrneder?) I capitulated, in towel and damp hair, and descended into the catacombs and reeled up an old edition of the Baha'i world. '68-71 I think.   For me, being so new to this elusive faith, there has honestly been no greater teacher than the Bahai World (although Uncle Mike comes close)....in particularly I love reading the detailed Memorials of the early pilgrims and praying for them. Lives of unalloyed surrender and service. Saints and angels and disciples who never once questioned the call to orchestrate a dance in a foreign country or surrender all personal material wealth to a cause greater than themselves...the sort of humble servants my parents were for their own faith (literally, my mom gave away the money Dad had saved up for her engagement ring to the church).....and so I open the book up and of course (TC SMILES) the first black and white rectangular photograph I see right when I randomly plop open the book is one Arya's grandfather pioneering in Jamaica, flooded by Jamaican townies, an almost feather-golden eternal grin humbly stitched into his face.   Uncle Mike has always been keen on praying for souls that have previously deaprted.   "Always remember to pray for the souls who don't have anyone to pray for them." Uncle Mike says, and whenever we drive past a cemetary, Uncle Mike always chants the short prayer for the departed and tells the anecdote about how he teaches Chinese students to drive in cemetaries, telling them. "Don't worry if you run over anything. They're already dead."   On my first dip into the House of worship, March 2003, I was all alone. I chain-smoked my way to Wilmette and went into the basement of the House first. A silver-haired, very tall, somewhat lanky woman dressed all in black named EVE, appeared in front of me. I told her I was a visitor from Peoria. She smiled. I asked her if she knew Uncle Mike. She said she didn't. I watched a brief cursory movie about the faith and then I entered the House fo Worhsip from the bottom via elevator. I still wasn't 'declared' or wahtever but the one prayer I said over and over again was the prayer for the departed. I thought about my father (I was still pissed off at God, maybe rightfully so)...I thought about my grandmother whose funeral was on Naw Ruz and whose time had come. I stared up at got lost into the satellite ceiling, my eyes, dizzy and flapping inwardly at the sight of the Greatest Holy Name.   But there was only silver-haired EVE with me in the House of Worship. She has a deep, baritone voice that blossomed forth in verbal bouquets everytime she smiles. She addressed everyone as honey.   "Thanks for coming honey," She said before saying the greatest holy name as I walked out of the House of Worship by myself.   I smiled.   Later that year, at Green Lake (where of course, all the magic happens--see Arya's recent splendiferous 'novel') I bumped into Eve again. She was in the cafeteria ferrying a tray to her seat. She was seated with a Knight of the Master (though, I didn't know it at the time). I scurried up to Eve and immediately thanked her for the tour the previous March. I told her that I was new to the faith and that was my first time at the House of Worship, last March, en route to my grandmother's funeral.   It was amazing what happened next. She didn't remember me but at the word 'funeral' she set down her tray on the nearest table, clasped her fists into a prayer sized-heart and immediately beagn to chant the Prayer for the Departed, in the middle of the cafeteria. She said it with her husky, feminine brass-instrument baritone. She kept her eyes stamped closed like she was shielding her spirit from a pending spiritual hurricane. She said the one prayer that I had been saying every night, and she chanted it for me even though she didn't know me at all. Even though I had approached her simply to thank her.   I almost cried right then and there.   Greenlake's sorta like sleepy-hollow. A Midwestern Baptist affilated bastion that once a year breaks out in spirtual hives. It's bloggworthy and inevitably will be. Strange things happen there. Mystical pinings and gentle breezes. Greenlakes how I know arya and where I met my friends Cool Abir and Dick and Anne (Anne's an artist, she's my spiritual godmother who has purple hair. She taught Uncle Mike the faith.....)   Last year at Greenlake was crazy because spiritual guru Thich Nhat Hanh, who wrote the book, Living Buddha, Living Christ and received ( I think) a nobel prize for peace, was slated to hold a conference the same day that the Baha'i conference ends. There was all these Buddhists disciples from all over the world, clad in taupe capes sauntering around the premesis lost in serene meditation ( the story about how I spilled a cup-of-java on a French Monk is also bloggsworthy...but not here).....   Last year at Greenlake I was being incessantly stalked by GreenLake Gretchen. She's sweet but also ( ) (smiles)....so yeah, needless to say I was graced with a shadow last GreenLake and somehow the shadow even got a hold of my work number and called me incessantly for four weeks straight after the conference ended.   While trying to evade the persistent paws of Greenlake Gretchen, I forced myself to actually HIDE near the lake for close to an hour Saturday night, and availed myself only when the mass of bodies exited from the auditorium from the talent show.   Caught up in the fluss and hoi-poloi, trying cognizantly to avoid Gretchen without hurting her feelings, who do I literally come tete-a-tete with? Unbelievable. There she was. The Knight of the Master, at eleven-thirty at night, slowly grappeling the rail outside the main building.   What happened next was also a gift.   I walked up to her, introduced myself, jutted out my elbow and offered her my arm. I escourted her back to her lodging facility, very slowly, talking. All I could do was thank her. She smiled and seemed slightly confused but nodded after my every effort to feebly convey spiritual gratitude.   When I helped her back into her room, Eve was there, asleep.   When I got back to my own room and told Mike about my experience the next morning at breakfast, he slanted his head back and forth  in disappointment.   "She's a Knight." In a hundred years from now she'd be swamped if she were walking home late-at-night. Alone."   Indeed, the faith has given me many gifts. Spirtual tablets, the insight of Uncle Mike, a return to prayer, the daily discourses with blogging beauty queens,... but no greater a gift has it given me than that one night at GreenLake last August where I was somehow granted the priveledge to escourt the arm of both a Knight of the Master and an angel at the same time.   O my God!  O Thou forgiver of sins, bestower of gifts, dispeller of afflictions!   Verily, I beseech thee to forgive the sins of such as have abandoned the physical garment and have ascended to the spiritual world.   O my Lord! Purify them from trespasses, dispel their sorrows, and change their darkness into light. Cause them to enter the garden of happiness, cleanse them with the most pure water, and grant them to behold Thy splendors on the loftiest mount.    -Abdu'l-baha

      *  This was originally a comment on Daniela's blog, but, alas, brevity has never been my forte.  *  I think the biggest mistake I've made in previous bouts with amour is this: it was always, (solely) about the other person and what I thought society orchestrated as acceptable. Not initially at first. At first it was about (still is about) my heart doing a little irish jig inside my chest and often times (honestly) being more allured to the feeling of Love...that drooling, dizzying, perplexing, wonderful state where everything around you....all of your romantic pinings, intellectual longings and flirtatious fetishes sprout up in front of you with boobs and bangs and sunset smiles. Moments like these propel the world of art. Laura inspired the pen of Petrach to devise his heart in the shape of the sonnet. Beatrice escourted Dante into the realm of the eternal light. Shams of Tabriz enflamed Rumi to swirl out his dervish longings in mystical adages. The Fair young Lad and the syphillis-ridden prostitute compelled the quill of William Shakespeare, whose sonnets were actually never intended to be published (kind of like our blogs--perhaps that's what they are eternal...the sonnets)....Here's my favorite Shakespeare Sonnet of all time. Sonnet 116:  Sonnet 116 William Shakespeare  Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments. Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove: O no! it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark, Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compass come: Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, But bears it out even to the edge of doom. If this be error and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no man ever loved.  *  I used to, of course, have good bullshit definitions of the word love I'd employ in the late ninetites to (as they say in the locker room) cirlce the infield. I used to quote First Corinthians 13 (The love chapter of the bible...you know, love is patient, love is kind, love is lugubrious, love is a financial burden, love is watching her pms outta control for three days a month and nodding your head in feigned measured incrememnts as she tells you over and over again that "You just don't understand me,")...I had this schtick where I said that if you take out the word Love from that biblical chapter and insert the word of your purported beloved there instead, you would have crafted via MAD LIBS a valid definition of the word Love.    *    I dunno. I went through a five year period where I dated a lot of older women. To my chagrin (hindsight being twenty-twenty) there was approximately a quarter of a century between Swissy-Who and Crazy Laurie. The only way I can tell about what I learned is to insert it honsetly into a recital like entry....And my advice to Lovers (I'm graciously flanked by two of them) is this. Find yourself first...Find that joy that you as a person solely possess...find what you are capable of giving and then give all of it. When this happens, mysterious creatures (some are lovers, but also little elves) creep out from the most unsuspecting places to assist you. To tell you that they believe in you. To tell you that they are in your corner, with their thumbs up, smiling.  My biggest sin was that, for years, I always equated my own self-worth and emotional status to the blonde on my left shoulder. We live in an accelerated image-driven society that hasn't made it easy for the true and disciplined lover. I don't know about you, but when the time rolled around and I was a crackly-voiced facial blemished fourteen year old with thick glasses and FINALLY (GHAST) had my first kiss (ahhhhhh......Jessica...wait, her name ends in an....!!!!!!), I had probably seen close to fifty thousand kisses climaxed on television and we didn't even get cable til I was ten.  So that's my ramble. I don't know much. I know that I love and that I live for apical moments of human connection. I know that I like to kiss. I know that it's just not plain healthy to follow your every innate, lusty animal instinct, even though you often find yourself on a dance floor where it seems to be encouraged (Funny how the Valley of Unbriddled Lust somehow got omitted from the final draft). I know that I live for moments of timelessness even though I live in the terse fleeting evaporating second of the moment itself. I know that I probably wouldn't have been a writer had I not had my heart smashed and crazy-glued back together and smashed again. I know that I'll never be a writer if I behave like a rockstar (even though I can dress like one). I know that I believe in the syncopated thuds of the human heart, the fathomless potential of mankind. I know that I'm sometimes a little envious at cool couples who have made it work and are still in love. I know that some nights I'm lonely but have no doubt that the pillow I'm groping will bear flesh and wings someday. I know that I'm grateful for everything. Dollops of blessings with a slice of forever pie.

      In the immortal words of gumdrop daddy Willy Wonka....  "My dear friend, Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker."  No, in the immortal words of Willy Wonka....  "We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of a dream."  "No!!!! In the immortal words of Willy Wonka....  "A communist, a lesbian and an Oompa-Loompa walk into a bar...."  NO!!!! In the immortal words of Willy Wonka, "A little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men." Only in the movie Gene Autry hums the proverb into the Winston Churchill-ish chin of my ex-girlfriend Veruca Salt's father after he pans Wonka's golden "good" egg "bad" egg machination as "alotta nonsense." Last night, during an untapped phone conversation with a friend (hmmmm...geez... wonder who?)I jabbered that I was going to change my name from the healthy germanic gruff of "David Von Behren" to the narcissistic banner of "Universal Male" so that everytime an angel hushes out a mystical maxim linked to the "Universal Male" motif they can feel free to flutter in my direction......    My health is improving in Goliath-like strides. Color has been finding it's way back into the folds of my face. Dreams adorn themselves to the ritual of sleep. I'm smoking less, hacking less, even keeping Uncle Mike's pad tidy for once. And even though I'm first to confess that longevity is over-rated and I'd rather die young than see myself in fifty years in both Dentures and Depends (the last Father/Son activity I shared with my Dad was helping him take a shit--God, who wants to be remembered like that?), the steady cramps and rashes and nausea that accompanied me like the trinity these last twenty-or-so months are slowly starting to subside, lifting north like a billowing stage curtain at the beginning of a high school thesbian production.   Of course, I can't grouse too much. I learned poverty, found Uncle Mike and learned not to be so stuffy and pretentious with my literary ambitions. One night, after fifteen months of failure and no sleep, I came home far past midnight and told Mike that I felt compelled to ink my John Hancock on a Declaration of faith.  And of course, imminently, there was no change. I still didn't sleep. I wrote filth disguised under the substratum of literary greatness. My car died the very next week (also a blessing), beautiful Erica Johnson still smiled at me crookedly and pretended she was deaf everytime I availed my dreams ...but, of course, I feel blessed to have been on such a path and await with wild anticipation what "universal" creature will sprout up naked next before my eyes.                             *  "I saw grief drinking a cup of sorrow and called out, "It tastes sweet, does it not?" "You've caught me," grief answered, "and you've ruined my business, how can I sell sorrow when you know it's a blessing?" — Jalaluddin Rumi                              * Sometimes I wonder (even in my own lifetime) if human beings will totally divorce themselves from the biological category of mammal. If the onslaught fluss of technology and global acceleration of mankind will propel us into a divine realm of both omniscient and astonishing creations. Even in my own lifetime, I've gone from sitting in front of a fuzzy screen, being educated by stringed-puppets ferrying letters and numbers to having eveything I can every fathom or even want to know  (even sins) in front of me, instantly, accessed with a few right clicks.   What a time it is to be alive. What a blessing it is simply to be.                                     * And the blessings were like poets that we never find time to know,  But when time stopped I found the place where the poets go.  And they said, "Here have some coffee, it's straight, black and very old,"  And they gave me sticks and rocks and stars and all that I could hold,   I had the blessings, a moment of peace even when the night ends,  Yeah the blessings, can we meet? Can we meet again,  At the crossroads of disaster and the imperfect smile,  With the angel in the streetlamp that blinks on as I walk on a mile, the blessings.   And the best ones were the ones I got to keep as I grew strong,  And the days that opened up until my whole life could belong,  And now I'm getting the answers, when I don't need them anymore,  I'm finding the pictures, and I finally know what I kept them for,  I remember, I can see them, see them smiling, see them stuck,  See them try, I wish them luck and all the blessings.   I was fast asleep at three in the morning when I got the payphone call,  And she said, "Did I wake you up," I said, "Hey, no, not at all."  And she said, "I got this suitcase and I don't know what to pack,"  And I said, "You can take anything you want, just wait and see,  It's not a release, not a reward, it's the blessings,  Its the gift of what you notice more,"  And I walked out and I watched her kick the big pile of the night,  And we sat down and we waited for that strange and empty light.  Yeah the blessings...   Folk Singer Dar Williams, "The Blessing" Mortal City (1996)

      Speaking of cyclesarya (sorry--I should try to me more respectful towards my friends  name) "cycles arya", every four years or so I find myself reading the same book, a book called IRON JOHN: A BOOK ABOUT MEN by poet ROBERT BLY. It's very Tristan Legend-of-the-Fallish in terms of mature masculine archtype. As badly as I want to make a career continually as a "published-purveyor of language" (damnit I'm already a writer, no matter how much lint I pocket in lieu of cash) part of me desires so badly to be able to DO THE RIGHT thing; become the man that I'm somehow suppose to be, to treat people the way they are meant to be treated....and to know what's the write (sic)...right thing to do at the time.  It's so hard, which is part of the adventure, if not the initial fun.  IRON JOHN is a Grimm's fairy tale that Robert Bly mythologically dissects like a game of Operation (when you feel an uncomfortable nasal shrill blinking through your body you know you've recognized what stage of the fairy tale your currently in)....I'll save you a book report but here's the chapter I was reading today (again)....The golden-haired boy has been exiled from the Wild Man to learn poverty (descending into his own wounds)...  "The man today, as he embarks towards the father's house, is in between these two mythologies. If he is an ascender, he flees from earth, dust, and flesh and effectively asks women to take care of the earth. By contrast, the old men, in traditional initiation lead the young man to the Beneath Father, near where the ancestors live and where the snakes are. The voyage does not exile him from heaven, for snakes can be found even in the crown of the tree. The snake swims in water as well. The snake is the Lord of the Waters. Mythologically, then, the snake resembles the Wild Man, the King, and other being who lie in the water at the bottom of our psyches.  "We surmise then when a man accepts Descent as a way to move to the father's house, he learns to look at the death side of things, he glances down at the rat's hole, which is also the snake's hole, and he accepts the snake rather than the bird as his animal. The father ins a middle-class household may own the car and the credit cards, but the motehr lives longer, and comes back form the cememtary after the fatehr is burried. The son feels a pull to identify with the mother's sturdiness and, beyond that, with the vibrant energy of the Great Mother.  " Initiation asks the son to move his love energy away from the attractive mother to the relatively unattractive serpent father. All that is ashes work (errata-like Cinderella )When a man enters this stage he regards DESCENT as a HOLY thing, he increases his tolerance for ashes, eats dust as snakes do, increases his stomach for terrifying insights, deepens his ability to accept evil facts of history, accepts the job at working seven years under the ground, leaves the granary at will through the rat's hole, bites on cinders, learns to shudder, and follows the voice of the old mole beneath the ground."  -(pgs 90-91)

      Greek weekend and everyone on campus seems to know my name. Walking back from Jesters with cup of java wedged in paw I get three simultaneous car beeps and two frat heads propping out of SUV side-windows cackeling, "DAVE!!!!!!!!!" Have no clue who these people are. Like a strand of DNA I keep weaving my way in and out of social clusters, seeking solitude one second and eternal companionship the next, knitting the genetic fabric of my own crazy aesthetic. Somehow, on campus, everyone knows me. I'm the crazy long-haired librarian who writes books. The one who's a few years older, but a few years youthful. The one who smiles at everyone, chats with all the foreign students, harnesses a weird lexicon, observes Holy Days for a weird religion, and sips coffee like his first wet-dream was about a mocha-eyed lass by the name of Gloria Jean.   Is this the Mara carnival? The escapade of strobelights reverberating their neon fizz in the streets beckoning me to join? The wadded phone digits with her name initialed and scribed in bubbly little carbonated feminine hearts? The one she hands me and I discard and crumple up into a baby cabbage and pretend that I'm in the NCAA tournament with three seconds on the clock when I fake, look, pump and fire for the nearest trash receptacle?  I once wrote a horrible indulgent puppy-eyed book by the name of "Where all the Dream charchters dream too" It was about a charchter named Maya (illusion) who could traverse time and space like it was nothing more than ledger lines on sheet music. It was sort've a cross between the girl I was in love with in fifth grade and watching her traipse to and from her piano lesson every Thursday.  But the idea of time being a veiled illusion; that diaphonous see-through cloth that the groom avails before seeing his bride's unblemished visage for the first time (although she had experienced him before) is intriguing.   *  Angel hoasanna and quick accolades! The Holy day went well!!!! We had a total of five people and I designed a cool program that Uncle Mike even approved. I read Chapter thirty-five from a book called "The Hour of the Dawn" by Mark Perkins.   The story of the Bab is one I've been thinking about lately especially in terms of surrender. The Bab employs his noted mystical "vanishing theatrics" because he has a job to do. He has a conversation to complete.   In the notion of surrender I feel like, even though the nature of life is precarious and transient, we know what our individual jobs are and we have the priveldge of tackeling them with joy on a daily basis. Yet, I feel a tugging below my ribs that informs me that, whatever you have to do in this lifetime, whatever you feel lead to acheive, will be completed; even if the fussilade of bullets is only a half-breath away from seperating you from mortality; your job, your duty (dharma), will sprout into fruition.

      One way to intuit Mara madness in my life is this: Mara represents that creature that I had to volitionally surrender in order to live the life that needs to be lead. Like the mother of Moses planting her swaddled progeny into the nile I love my Mara's so much (Swissy-Missy and the Morning Mara of today)and know that they will transition into a Pharoah goddess someday. Mara comes back to tempt me, to show me perhaps what could have been, to say "This creature could have been yours if you'd chosen the path of society. The path of the village-compound."  Joseph Campbell--The Campbell crackhead that I am--says that in life there are two paths; The path of the society and the path of the individual.   {Please refrain from jesting the all-too-obvious Robert Frost "Road Less Traveled" chorus.}  The path of society is the path with road signs. It's the path that tells you exactly how-many-miles-there-is-to-the-next-port. It's the "coacktail" or "family holiday obligatory query" path b/c it shows similar passengers just exactly where you're at. When a relative asks you how many more years of school you have left? or what islands you plan on frequenting on your pending cruise? you know that your on the path of the society. On this path the landmarks are very well meted and emotionally measured. My sister and her husband are grand navigators of this path. They know exactly how much more schooling they have left, exactly where they will be in five years (Lawyer, Doctor) and even in fifteen years (senator, congressman--ooops, sorry Beth-- Congressbitch...or, I mean woman (smiles sis)...It's really beautiful in a way because the sole purpose of the village compound path is to ensure the continuity of the immediate surroundings and the cultural augmentation of society.  This is a wonderful path. The essence of the American dream is the pavement for this interstate. If you know how to read the signs, the destinations are endless and there's no telling how far you can travel and what sights will be seen! But, with this path, you have to obey the traffic lights. You have to stop occasionally, you can't speed. The detination is there and the atlas unfolds into a perfect map of your own heart. It's a grand path and one that ensures the greatness and vast depth of mankind.  The second path Campbell notes is more precarious--it's the path of the individual. The individual path is the path of which society has no notion, but it is a path that, if traversed, is often historically venerated with awe. It's the path that, if your at a family holiday and you inform your in-laws that you've spent over 2000 hours diligently milking a book mansucript they look at you with their holiday tonic and immediately want to know when you're going to be published and the net worth of your advance.   It's a very lonely path and it's dangerous because there's no stop signs, the sun sets are more luminous, the mountains are full of menacing dragons.   There are no stop signs on this path. No mileage charts or assurances to tell you "if you go here, you'll get here." You could write the perfect song on this path or push the realm of contemporary art to the next canvas and never see the destination port in your lifetime. Many artist have slip in unhealthy tendencies b/c, they are expecting to have the imminent rewards and mileage of the first path intesect with the spontaeous spring and torrential fall of the second.  "You can't have it both ways." Campbell iterates. "The insecure path is really the secure path."  In regards to my Mara all I can say is this: Swissy-Missy and other makeshift muses become emblematic of what might have been--what my life could be; could obtain if I spent more time crusing on the Society's freeway and less time scaling the side of my own Devil's Tower. When I was 'with' Miss Swissy I wanted so F'ing badly to give her everything; to kiss that tiara of sunshine on her forehead everymorning and tuck her in with my voice everynight. The problem being, as Campbell points out (again)....  "You can't have it both ways."  At least not now. I'll find the elusive queen or whatever eventually (find her so many times), I have no doubt about that, since I've found magicians, gypsies, trobadors, Kings, dragons, trollopes and fellow warriors on this path, I'll find the golden-tressed daughter of a King or whatever.   My Mara looks at me with those eyes that say "come" everytime they blink. Those eyes that say "If you come with me we could have a wonderful life on the Interstate path. We could be successful and have a morgage and a beautiful family."  I think the reason the last two Mara's have appeared "blurry" is because my inner-self, the self that serves a Virgil to my mischevious Dante, knows that I'm acknowledging this Mara and I know what has to be done. Knows that you can't serve two masters and be successful. Knows that, kiddo, you chose the road of the individual and there's so many more sunsets, so many more creatures and that every moment on that road will last forever.

      ...and I still can't wake up. Bumped into yet another Mara this morning. Her name also ends with the letter a; which is rather quickly  becoming my least favorite vowel of the entire alphabet. Her boyfriends name is also Tim (Swissy-Missy b-friend's name) and she's also a wheresdaniela/ patiencearya mystical compository i.e., she studies Cherokee medicine and knew all about me and I didn't recognize her. Didn't recognize who she was at all. For two whole days.  Still couldn't sleep last night. The insomnia richter scale is toppeling man-made topography inside my chest and forehead. I once saw a baptist pastor friend of mine give this poignant sermon where he said that, in terms of universal sign language, the finger sign for "peace" was second only to the hands-in-the-air capitulation motion that equates "surrender".   I like that anaolgy a lot. Some Baptists like to pray with their hands in the air, as if surrendering themselves--everything they are as individuals--to the godhead.     My mom prays like this. She's a very spiritual person (reminds of patiencearya in alotta ways that are not freduian connoted). Growing up mom was always up before Dawn, hunched over her throroughly annotated bible, underlining stanza's and praying with a constipated expression on her face. I've seen her fast and from a young age I was taught that the really only thing that was important in life was "acknowledging Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior".  For her notion of God, she's lived a life of complete humilty and servitude and I feel like I myself may even trump her notion of God by availing certain facets of the Universal Light which I have been fortunate enough to have spiritually felt.  But I love the notion of surrender. True in faith, but even candidly, more true in artistic endeavors....I had a dream last week where I was wedged inside an advent calender and everytime I opened a door there was another door. The doors were hard wooden and mideval and thick and I had absolutely no trouble opening them (which seemed to surprise the faceless companion in my dream)but after about twenty of thirty doors I was exhausted, and couldn't pry open the hedge of another thick wooden door on my own.   Being the Advent calender it was like, always Christmas Eve but never Christmas.  From that periphery, I was having a hard time getting to the virgin birth. I was having a hard time leaving my Jerusalem for the city of David. Was having a hard time caring for my pregnant wife who was carrying a child that was not really my own. I was having a hard time adjusting to the shit-stench of the stable. Was having a hard time giving birth to the virgin, revitalizing "new" energy that was waiting behind the last door.  I thought about how Christ says that when you knock the door would be open, but you have to knock (I didn't knock in my dream, I just shed door frames, tossing them down like loosing lottery tickets)...I thought about how Rumi has a poem where the seeker knocks and knocks and still the door won't open and then he realizes with a laugh that "He's been knocking on the inside door"--(TCSMILES)that he was already in the realm he yearned for just could not see it spiritually. I even thought about Axl Rose caterwauling a stellar rendition of Dylan's "Kocking on Heaven's Door" 1992 Wimbledon benefit memorial concert for Freddie Mercury. I thought about all of this. Knock on wood, and then I thought about the notion of surrender and maybe that's what's wrong with me. That I have to surrender all to my little world of sloppy sentences and character development. That I have to give more and not think about myself.  As Black Sabbath (of all the conspicuously non-spiritual bands) note: "Give it all and ask for no return and very soon you'll see and you'll begin to learn that it's alright, yeah it's alright."  So I need to capitulate more. I understand what I'm here to do is just pure action. I left the port along time ago to find that crazy dreamer enmeshed between the covers of his creations and there's more than that. When you get to your destination and you see that the person whom you have been so assiduosly seeking looks exactly like you, you know that what you were yearning for was the experience. What you were seeking was the initial search. The reward is in the sojourn and in the giving.  It's pure giving; it's sacrifiecing the security and commodities of life for something that will help someone else.   It's Alright (1976)  Told you once about your friends and neighbors  They were always seeking but they'll never find  That it's alright, yes it's alright   Where to go, where to be  It's always been that way and it will always be  But it's alright, yes it's alright   Give it all and ask for no return  And very soon you'll see and you'll begin to learn  That it's alright, yes it's alright   Don't you know that it's so good for you  You can be making love and I see it all go through  But it's alright, yes it's alright   Hold her now and you can both go home  It's been a long time coming but you've fianlly shown  That it's alright, yes it's alright

      Every year on my birthday I always imagine the same scenario. I see myself in a big smoky room with lots of books and I am having conversations with myself at different stages of my life. For instance, twenty-seven year old David with long hair and cigarettes and a telephone thick manuscript he keeps referring as his "three-and-a-half-year-old" is in the same room with seventeen year old David who has short hair and smooth skin with the occasional forehead blemish. Seventeen year old David keeps on whipping a picture of his Drivers License which he just got (sixteen year old David failed the test his first three times) and twenty-seven year old David wryly offers a nostalgia ridden smile when he sees his younger self, listening to the seventeen year old rant about being the cross-country captain in high school; talking about his recent trip from Paris, and how he is still in love Jennifer. Twenty-seven year old David refers to seventeen year old David as Kiddo (Seventeen year old David doesn't like this) and tells him that if you think ashen-face Jenny Wilson was anything wait to you see what the next quick decade has in store.   The two David's exchange glances. They both have the same color eyes, an anomolous hue what can only be described as "Honey-Blue". Seventeen year old David wants to know the answer. He wants to know about adulthood. He wants to know about his friends and family (he is oblivious that his grandmother has four years left on the planet and his own father has seven)he wants to know where he will be in ten years (surely London) and who he will marry (either Harmony, Renae or Jen Wilson for sure)or what he will be doing (probably working for a traveling magazine, no, wait--he'll be a curator at the uffizi since he loves art and plans on majoring in art history in college) only Twenty-seven year old David smiles, utters something about the search being more important than the Discovery and tells him to enjoy the next ten years. To enjoy every second of it.  Seventeen year old David wears a cross around his neck. He thinks twenty-seven year old David is cool, only he uses a ton of vocab-words that seventeen year old David has never heard used casually before. Seventeen year old David looks at the thick manuscript in twenty-seven year old David's arm and wonders why it is, exactly, that his decade older shadow refers to that as his daughter. Seventeen year old David has never written a short story or a poem and reads usually only what is assigned to him. Twenty-seven year old David smiles. He wants to inform seventeen year old David about all the timeless beauty, the pain and sadness that will inevitable transpire over the next ten years. He wants to tell him to spend more time with his Dad and grandma-as much time as possible. He wants to tell him to implore his father to switch high schools because something bad is about to occur. He wants to tell him to quit feeling like a sinner all the time. That, in terms of theology--seventeen year old David is president of the Church Youth Group--Wow kiddo, the shit is really gonna hit the fan and somethings you believe in now very passionately will, in ten years, be totally reversed.   Twenty-seven year old David wants to tell seventeen year old David about his mistakes. Tell seventeen year old David that he will fuck up royally on more than one occasion. That he will hurt people. That he will fight with his parents and damn his rival siblings. That he should learn to respect people. That he should not let his pending hobby ameliorate his ego the way it will.   Twenty-seven year old David wants to tell seventeen year old David about the places he has been. About the writers he has discovered. The people he has met; the hands he has held in public.  Twenty-seven year old David wants to be a mentor to seventeen year old David. He wants to tell him that, when someone is doing something bad (seventeen year old David had some bad shit happen to him when he was younger) be a man and show some fucking balls.   Twenty-seven year old David wants to tell seventeen year old David that smokings not cool (as he hides his own cigarello behind his back), that being drunk all the time by no means helps cultivate your artistic merit, that its not cool to cheat on women, that he should learn how to wear a condom since his father never really told him about sex.  He wants to tell seventeen year old David all about bills and credit cards. car insurance, cell phone bills, internet fetishes and exorbitant college loans.   He wants to tell him all about joy.  Twenty-seven year old David smiles to himself when he thinks that he should really tell seventeen year old David that, when he meets any person by the name of Brook, Lisa, Elisa or Laurie he should run like a bat out of hell. He wants to tell seventeen year old David to keep up with the athletics. That even though he's gonna be going through some tough shit, he still has it better than more than 90% of the planet and that all of his talents are by no means afforded privledges; they are gifts and should be used to help others.  Twenty-seven year old David wants to tell seventeen year old David to believe in himself. To roll up his shirt sleeve and have a little confidence. To quit sulking all the time and stop listening to so much Morissey.  Twenty-seven year old David confesses to seventeen year old David that he still lisetens to Tori Amos and Enya from time to time, that no, he doesn't live in Europe but he's found what could one day be a proffession and he's found something he actually loves doing.   Twenty-seven year old David quotes Wittgenstein and Augustine ("Beerstein" thinks seventeen year old David) Seventeen year old david looks at him funny. He will discover Walt Whitman this October. In less than a year Seventeen year old David will be less of a burgeoning athlete. His room will smell less like a locker room and more like moldy, second hand books.  Just when Twenty-seven year old David is informing seventeen year old David that, whatever you do in life, don't take it too seriously, laugh, can the ego, in walks thirty-seven year old David. Thirty-seven year old David stares for a long time at seventeen year old David. He still has all his hair and smiles more than both of them combined. Thirty-seven year old David has secrets and joy and more loss. There's been more deaths. The shade on his face informs his two younger selves that he's had some success in whatever arena he's in. Forty-seven year old david walks in, smoking a pipe with crisp gray hair followed by (if I'm lucky) a fifty-seven year old david, having experienced even more loss but even more joy.   All the David's congregate in the smoky room and they laugh. They are all telling jokes. The older David seems to have a problem with gas. The seventeen year old David tries to bum a cigarette off the Twenty-seven year old David who harnagues him. There is laughter and food and drinks. Each decade david has a secret, has something he has done in the last ten years that he's not proud of and something he has done that he is. Soemthing that the younger David doesn't know about yet. Soemthing the older David wishes he could forget.  All the David's have something the other David's want. The forty-seven year old David seems to have a little bit of financial largesse. The thirty-seven year old David wants to show the Twenty-seven year old david a picture of his knock-out wife. The fifty-seven year old David wears old-computer thick glasses, has gained weight after a bout of chemo and somehow has a thick white beard (all the other david's can't grow beards) granting him the semblance of Harley-Davidson mugging Santa Claus. The oldest David keeps looking at the twenty-seven year old David like he has something that he lost once, and was never able to get back. He wants to tell him not to lose it; not to lose that one thing. He wants to tell him this as much as Twenty-seven year old David wants to tell seventeen year old david things--only he can't because all the David's silence when they see a young boy the size of a barstool apprehensively looking at the older men in fuddled astonishment. The boy has an alter-boy haircut, kitchen floor smooth skin and blurred vision (glasses come when he's eight)--Seven year old David has never heard of the 'f-word', and goes to Sunday school every week. He's capable of informing the older men of who Jesus is and that Ronald Reagan is the president. His parents let him stay up and watch the A-team sometimes.  Seven year old David is afraid of the older men. He is apprehensive of their disel-thick odor. He coughs at the slightest lick of their nicotine.  But seven year old david (with the same color eyes) has soemthing inside of him that completely silences all the other five David's. He has something beneath his skin, inside the jungle gym of his calcium-fortifying ribs that simply astounds the other five men in the room. The fifty-seven year old David smiles.  "Tell us something, brother." I say to myself; a half-century between my voices.  Seven year old David loves Jeusus. He loves his mom and he cried at Christmas when he found a BMX stashed under the Christmas tree.   Seven year old david has been completely free of sorrow.  "Tell us something, little man." The fifty-seven year old David says. Everyone in the room is silent. Seven year old David has a room of his own now. He is a big boy. He knows that Jesus loves him. He knows his phone number and address. He knows his am and pm's. He can point out Peoria on the map and spell the state that he lives in. His parents held him back in first grade because he was slow at math and tentative with reading. He is by far one of the slowest learners in Miss Heintz second grade class, yet all the men want him to say something almost important.  "Ok," David says, looking down. He shushes his honey-blue eyes and quietly quotes the one poem he says every night when his father comes into his bedroom and kisses his forehead and tells him that he loves him and tucks him in....Seven year old David even smiles as he bows his chin and clicks his eyes into a squeeze and says the prayer he says with his father every night. A prayer about the light going away and a prayer about a God who is implored to listen to his children while they pray.

      Can't even begin to smash enough syllables together and describe to you what I felt during the two consecutive screenings of BEFORE SUNSET (Shown in funky Lincoln Park no less!)--Everything in my chest just sort of rumpled opened and emptied like ice in a kitchen dispenser. The first movie was nothing short of a romantic slice of perfection and verisimilitude mingled with a potent shot cinematic chemistry a la Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke. I was reading one review where the critic said that you could put both movies on mute and watch the two protagonists facial nuances and subtle tics and experience exactly what they are feeling! It's so true! What's amazing is how the charachters still harbor many of the same predilections that emotionally governed them in their mid-twenties even though they are now in their early thirties. It's more than a work of art; its a work of life and should be required viewing for anyone randomly peaking into the question mark-shaped keyhole of the Eternity blog--all 800 of you!  Mystical fortissimo or romantic malaria? I stayed out way late July 4th and snatched the Peoria Charter en route to Midway at 4am Monday morning.Hoo-kay; given the blogging discourses over the past month whom do you think was the only other patron on the bus at that time? Ms. Mara guised as a Stepford Wife-wannabe, Swissy-Missy, herself! Un-bull-insert-your-most-shocking- invective-here-leave-able! At 4 am in the freaking morning! (Thank you madame arya for diagnosing myself and swissy-wishy with a 'spiritual contract' way back yonder--it's time we got that neutered)...anyway, what's even more weird is that we didn't talk and I really didn't offically 'see' her until right when she got out....  Let me explain. Everytime I try to be quote 'adultish' or quote 'responsible' things get socially unkempt. Happens every time. I was in the midst of a no-sleep binge and figured I'd somehow endeavor to garner a little shut-eye on the charter bus. I took my contacts out (I have horrible vision and despise spectacles) a little before I arrived at the station and stoically waved at a blurred couple who knew my name. Since I'm a workaholic allota people know me from the library so I figured it was no big deal, plus my whole body was anchored in exhaustion.  When I boarded the bus my first thought was-"Shit, that was Swissy-Missy and her beau who bested me and I just gave them the figurative finger by being aloof and standoffish." I dismised the thought and fell asleep and woke up around six-thirty, plopping my contacts in just before I saw Swissy herself exit the bus. I wasn't even sure it was her (she on the other hand was wearing glasses, something I'd never seen before)until I saw her last name in the license plate of the car that picked her up.  What do you think about that?  Even more ironic, The last gift I gave Swissy-Missy was my DVD of Before Sunrise, Linlater's first moive, whose sequeal I had gone to Chicago solely to see later that day.       Let me iterate that I'm completely over Swissy and ardently apologetic that I raffled so many of my emotions in front of my fellow beloved blogsters. Swissy and myself didn't really have that much in common from the outset; we never 'officially' dated, had a few moments of snug intimacy that normally ended with her being  extremely polite and professional on sort've an airplane stewardess caliber and me drooling, begging, living mostly in my cloudy little dreamworld of perfection I have gyrating at all times inside my skull. If Swissy would pop out of a birthday cake today wearing nothing but a Detroit Pistons ballcap and panties I would still be turned off; but something in the fact that we keep on randomly sauntering into each other (esp. when its just not healthy) is plain weird.

      Just blogged an 'ugly' recital entry with a pretty name where all my sins drip down the side of the page like dirty icicles in late February. Uncle Mike has been effusive to the point of emotional anarchy. We're always on the go and he insists on picking me up and dropping me off at work, even though I much rather walk. Love Uncle Mike to astral-schellings but eventually I need a moment of late-twenty-something peace.  No one in the library seems to speak english today.  As with daniela, I'll be unbloggable for the next couple of days (ha-ha get your mind outta the gutter!)It'll be nice to be by myself and think my own thoughts.   Yeah, that's a good way to enter your next lap around the sun. To be by yourself, and to harvest big thoughts. Thoughts that eventually, will change the world.  *****************************************************************

      Birthday itineray is in germinal fetus-kicking-the-underbelly-blueprints stages. Tenatively I'll be kicking it with Moma Bear this sunday for lunch. Her chucrh always sports a jingoistic fourth of july farce and she already bought me a ticket...maybe I should tell her that I'm a Ba....a very semi-spiritual person as is. (Smiles)-My sister and cool brother in law will be in town so we should have a good time.  Hang out with Uncle Mike Sunday afternoon. We still couldn't get the Tractor to utter a mechanical yawn this afternoon so tomorrow I'll be using an old 1940-ish manual mower to trim the fornt of the house.  Monday morning (day b-4 b-day but day library is closed for fourth) I leave P-town via bus at 4 am and arrive at Midway airport 7:30. Take the L into the gut of Chi-town, depart L in the Loop, hit heavily the mutlifarious Starbucks, about a billion green constellations dotted circuitously off Michigan Ave, spend a narrow hour absorbed in the Contemporary wing at the Art Institute (there's this one Matisse that absolutely DESTROYS me every time my eyelashes channel surf across it)--go to AFTERWARDS my favorite used book store on the planet--talk to the owner like I am Hemingway's heir (this is called netwoking--selling myself to get my pages 'out there') and then at 1:10 hit the first of two consecutive showings of BEFORE SUNSET before eventually, wending my way back to Midway en route to Peoria via charter bus.  Not a bad way to official welcome my 27th year on this planet. Age is arbitrary and completely subject to the vicissitudes of passion and joy. When I was twenty-two I was arrogant beyond all belief, thought I was important and omniscient (though not in the beloved Mara-Arya sense)- and behaved like Frasier's younger borther Niles--socially snotty and hard to digest. Now I'm a burgeoning 27, (incidentally, half the age of my father before his demise)and I can't stop clicking the heels of my Doc Martens together in youthful elation and perpetual ambition. I can't stop writing, I can't stop falling in love with other human beings, I can't stop learning, I can't stop pulsating with life. I can't stop living.   "The opposite of war isn't PEACE--it's CREATION."  -Jonathan Larson  "The world of arts is the earthly paradise." -Joseph Campbell  "If by eternity is understood not infinite temporal duration but non-temporality, then it can be said that a man lives eternally if he lives in the present." -Wittgenstein  Can't think of any more cool quotes. On a high right now. One of my cool creative writing prof's, BRILLIANT Doc. Palakeel just sauntered into the library and I was already talkin' writing jive with JORDAN-to-my-Pippen writer NIck Thorton. NOthing beats it when writers hang out together (esp. when they've been pummeling out those sentences all day, all week)...We kind of augmented each other's highs. Palakeel's written three refulgent plays in the last year!!!!! One of his formidable play's was titled THE GOLDEN ASS ass and guess who got to play the eunuch (hmmmmmmm)....       Alright, winding down. Life is good. I still won't be able to sleep tonight.

      Having a hard time writing and sleeping this week for some reason. Maybe its the trying move pinched with allergy nausea (my nose is a gunked-up faucet) Uncle Mike said something really brilliant last night. He talked about the faith rocketing solely towards the future.  "Often times in our own lives we have a tendency to look back and try to figure out what happened. This is true in psycho-analysis. Instead of focusing with precision on where we want to go, we ponder invariably what traumatic event must have happened to us the moment the baby carriage rolled off the front porch.  "The faith focuses on the future. It focuses on changing our thinking (as Shogi Effendi says). It's not about what has been done before as much as it is what will be done."  Mike used a cool proveb by Jesus but I was too enervated to remember the exact details. Soemthing about when your ploughing a field and slicing up arable soil into furrows, if the driver of the plough keeps his eye keenly focused on a spot in front of him, he will have a straight line and a profitable harvest. If the driver of the plough keeps looking over his shoulder to see what land was already sewn, his horse will slightly swerve and at the end he will discover that his line is not straight, diminishing the supply of his harvest.  I really liked that analogy. I'm always hung up and looking back over something. Whether it's inwardly lamenting over my father's death or reflecting over that one moment with that one perfect girl and trying to viacriously relive that emotion in ersatz others...and I still emotionally tackle the painful penumbra's of highschool and around-the-clock work life as a validation for my own personal "sulk"--but honestly, as much as I love to look into the purple-hue of that country sunset and think about what once was, I love theorizing the fact that I haven't hit my peak yet, that I haven't yet said what I'm suppose to say and that in my own life (as well as in the faith) everything is spring soil fraught with mulch and dirt and who knows what color the pedals will unfold when touched by the fortifying shaft of light?

      Of course, just my luck. "Before Sunset" opens tomorrow and it has a limited release. I was planning on spending my birthday totally whacked out in the theatre, bawling, sipping on my doctored libation, having terse, meatphysical awakenings and eye-opening epiphanies, realizing that its myself on screen (the Ethan Hawke charachter has become a novelist--go figure)....oh well, my friend Shannon gave me a free ticket to Farenheit 9/11 and my new mantra for the pending election is this: John Kerry's just like a condom-it may be uncomfortable but for your own health you sometimes have wear one. Kerry's political antics may be initially uncomfortable to the earlobe but for the time being, we have to vote for him.  Anyway, work still sucks (or my bosses cudgeled lip is sucking the life outta me!) Uncle Mike and I have been moving. Our house is a mess, our lawn needs to be mowed and our 'tractor' lawn mower we inherited has a dull blade. Life is sometimes perfect in its domestic turbulence--don't you think?  Here's what Mercury News says about Before Sunset:     In "Before Sunset," Celine and Jesse also achieve a sort of peace together. As fans will remember, at the end of "Before Sunrise," they left each other at the train station in Vienna without exchanging last names or addresses, but with a promise to meet again in six months (from June 16, which James Joyce readers will note is Bloomsday) at that very same spot.  From the beginning of "Before Sunset," it's clear that they did not meet again in Vienna. But Jesse is open about the fact that he never got over it: In fact, he has just written a highly romantic novel about their experience. He's on a book tour, doing a reading at Paris' Shakespeare & Co., when she shows up. He's bowled over; she's outwardly casual. They have about an hour before he has to catch his plane back to New York.   What's unusual about "Before Sunset" is that while it is the sexiest movie to come along in years, the actual physical interaction between Celine and Jesse is kept to the barest minimum. Any seduction is within the mind and, as a result, it's a study in subtlety. Linklater, working in real time - the couple has only 80 minutes together this time, in contrast to their full day and night together in Vienna in 1994 - has managed to capture that unique tension between human beings on the edge of touching, but not quite there.  "The goal was actually to capture that moment before anything happens," said Delpy, calling from her home in Los Angeles to talk about the film. "All that flirting, but not the obvious flirting, the kind of more intellectual kind of flirting."  Maybe that's because desire, an emotion best displayed in our eyes, has become a commodity, a commodity co-opted by an immature pop culture revolving around gyrating teenagers with impossibly perfect, oiled-up bodies. Movie desire has to look like the desire portrayed in ad campaigns: chiseled features, tousled hair, a Versace number cut down to here. Linklater and his two stars have deliberately made a movie that refutes that.

      Tired. Tired. Tired. Here's a fun little poem by Sharon Olds I've been thinking about while riddled with bouts of insomnia:   Topography  Sharon Olds  After we flew across the country we got in bed, laid our bodies delicately together, like maps laid face to face, East to West, my San Francisco against your New York, your Fire Island against my Sonoma, my  New Orleans deep in your Texas, your Idaho bright on my Great Lakes, my Kansas  burning against your Kansas your Kansas burning against my Kansas, your Eastern Standard Time pressing into my  Pacific Time, my Mountain Time beating against your Central Time, your  sun rising swiftly from the right my  sun rising swiftly from the left your  moon rising slowly form the left my  moon rising slowly form the right until  all four bodies of the sky burn above us, sealing us together,  all our cities twin cities,  all our states united, one  nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

      So much for being a cyber recluse. So much for serenity. So much for being a dot.com luddite who refuses to lose his elbow-grease blue-collar lunchpail writing antics in lieu of a week brimming with the possibility of Thoreau-like Tranquility. So much for Starbucks House Decaf Blend which I bought in bulk from Sam's Club yesterday in an ill-timed endeavor to gradually wean me away from the knee cap-jittery-pyrotechnic nerve-imploding potion commonly refered to in the North American cultural arogt as a cup-o-joe and, after freshly percolating the decaf grains and taking a half-swig of my morning ersatz ablution I rashly dumped the pot over and abruptly sprinted to JESTERS coffee where I took formidable pleasure ingesting a bona fide cup-o-joe with an extra shot of espresso before logging on to my workstation this morning.   AHHHHHHHH......life is back to normal.  Made out with Mara this weekend which was the impetus of much social peril. Mara's real name is Lilith the Librarian. Lilith likes to toast a few wine coolers by herself around happy hour and then call up her co-workers drunk and harangue them for pulsating. She's been doing this for quite a while now and for some reason the faceless corporate shadows upstairs have grown innured to her antics and continue to pardon her. Last month she went on her weekly binge and really hurt a dear friend of mine. (Called her house. Said that her daughter was a slut. That sort of thing.)  Working with Lilith is like opening the passenger door for an acquaintance after a company party and watching them still take pleasure in vomiting on your dashbaord. Ever since Lilith hurt my friend I've remained amicably aloof. Yesterday it festered. She snapped. I snapped. And then, suddenly, little graphic novel POW and BLAM signs were popping up everywhere. Holy Non-Detachment Batman.  I hate losing my collective cool and I totally did yesterday. I got written up for saying the f-word. She went to her office and poured another peach schnapps. I threatened to file a grievance charge if she didn't apologize for always hurting people. She went home early.   Ahhhhh....life is back to normal.  Of course, as with any tiff, things blow over. Find that narrow channel of co-worker equilibrium ( or toleration?) and the jarring emotional straight navigates the Atlantic into the Pacific. Lock two diverse-sexed gorrilas in a cage and before that take a sincere jab at pecking out HAMLET they'll either mate or hit each other over the head. Same is true with the marriage of two mara-oriented minds. THWAP!  Of course, it wasn't a dud. I slumbered home defeated (Mistuh D was Mistuh Disconsolate) and this segued perfectly into a lecture from Uncle Mike on Detachment.  "If you don't detach yourself from the problem, you're never going to be able to harness the solution." He said.  And of course, I don't detach. When Joseph Campbell comments on detachement he talks about Christ in the Garden. When Christ was betrayed by Judas his disciple Peter un-sheathed his sword and ( in a manner that only mirrors the notorious 'ear' scene in Tarrentino's Rez' Dawgz) severed of the earlobe of a Roman assailant. Christ picked up the ear-lobed, healed his enemy's side visage and then turned back to Peter.  "Put down your sword," was what Christ told him.  I should of just sat on my sword or swallowed my tongue, but no, I brandished my blade and thrashed into battle. I was out for blood, or at least a scalp.  Uncle Mike told me the story about when the Master was in Hafai he had a men spit at him everyday for Twenty-three years. The Master would give him money too, and then man would still spit at him.  "You don't think that didn't require detachment?" Uncle Mike inquired.  SWOOOOOOOOP! (That's the sound of my graphic novel sword that I'm about ready to re-sheath.)   Thank god for little tiffs and thank god for friends. Talked with daniela last night (she was graceful receptacle for my angst) and she even chanted a very kind prayer. Have you seen daniela's blogg recently? All of a sudden her blogg's become the universalized mystic social hub (and I feel like I'm only a spoke in the wheel).....wow, guess when you emanate forth with so much light, everyone wants proximity; everyone wants their skin to turn gold; everyone wants their spirit to transition into an auburn tan.  Time to go, but not before I make more Holy comic book sounds, Batman.  THWAP!!!! FAWHIZZZZZZ!!!!! SHACKLE-JACKLE!!!!!!!!!!! FWOW!!!!!!!!!!!!

      After two months plus, Little David is taking a break from the Bloggsville Shire in order to trek and extinguish his own Mt. Doom ( I'm taking a break from a lot of things in order to find a lot of things).....I'll be completely Net-free until next Friday, so, in emergency, plug into Bradley's campus and hit ext. 3315 and someone should be able to tell you my whereabouts--but hopefully there will be no such cause and your next week shall be as serene as mine.  Those who visit this blogg will be 2x blessed if the visit the bloggs of Mrs. arya badiyan (who lured me in to all this) and Ms. daniela kantorova (who lured me somewhere else). Both names are synonymous with eternity's Beatrice for surely they have led this particular wild-hearted Dante into the lips of paradise.  I'll be spending next week cleaning Uncle Mike's mansion, working on my huge book, doing laundry (first time since...well..icky male gross get away).....I'll also be praying, supplicating, dreaming, reading Juliet Thompson, preparing to get a good jump out of the gates in preparation for this pending semester, a senior year long overdue.  Forehead kisses all around for the experience. If you need me, you know where to look....  Nowyaseeme  *poof*

      Implore both members of my benevolent-hearted bloggin' ensmeble to squint out as far as they can, out past the contours and fuzzy-glare of the computer square, past the room where they are currently squashed, up through the aqua-windshield atmospherical tint of reality (while your squinting--trying doing that ankle-number six rotation thing daniela devised which I still can't master).....look out as far as you can. I'm starting to believe that if we squint hard enough, we'll be able to see the hand of the author that's composing this spasmodic tale of interconnected glory.  If the 'He Who Lives in the Moment...' blogg were a seasonal novella dashed with an additional espresso shot of intrigue, this would be the climax. The moment of suspense. The moment when the reader shifts their bottom and crosses their legs and inches their chin closer to the line of print.  Big pending week ahead of me. Can't go into extreme detail as of yet, but next week is a week of meditation and service and prayer and self-actualization. A time for me to tidy-up Uncle Mike's pad. A time for me to sift through boxes; a time for me to wade through all the emotional detrirus and joy that has gunked up inside both spine and stomach.  It'll be a week of meditation. I'm getting ready for a pending school year and as always, things are academically dubious. Perhaps that's part of the joy. Part of the suspense. Nothing beats being the lead protagonist in a novel that you are writing about yourself and being completely uncertain about what discourse shall inevitably transpire next.  The first time I ever heard of Rumi, the program was called 'Love's confusing Joy,'.....Coleman Barks gave a formidable reading. Here's the quote:  "If you want what visible reality can give, you're an employee. If you want the unseen world, you're not living your truth. Both wishes are foolish, but you'll be forgiven for forgetting that what you really want is love's confusing joy."  I go deep into the woods last night, found a clearing and shouted prayers at the beaded illuminating stars that squinted back at me with cat eyes. I saw a 'vision' of concourse J.T. (hallucination--imminent feeling in my chest that I wasn't s'pose to blogg that...alright then; it was probably just the light).....I make a covenant with myself that next week I'll work out; that I'll exercise, that'll I'll (first since '92) GO A WEEK WITHOUT COFFEE, that I'll flush out my system, that I'll be continually kind to people; that I'll become a luddite, that, after arguably four years of being perpetually on the go, I'll apply the emergency screech breaks to halt the emotional stagecoach.....  Dreamt last night that I was kickin' it with LeBron James (only LeBron was HIV+) and that I had to get to GreenLake only I couldn't because I had to work (as is true this year with this years GreenLake) and then I started making love to my Best friend's fiance who I honestly can't stand, b/c even though she's engaged to my friend she's (in real life) "fooling" around with some of my other friends and I found this out earlier in the week and almost became Vesuvius and erupted at her but then chose to live by the mantra "You've got to let people live their lives; you got to let people rake up their own mistakes and fumble through their own foibles" and last night in my dream I am making love to the girl I despise, brushing up against her and she is smiling and I can't stand looking her in her face. Can't stand having her stale-cottage cheese thighs wreathed around my torso; can't stand sweating as one integer with her. Can't stand her devious pumpkin smile....  And I wake up this morning in a puddle of nocturnal dew dripping from my forehead and the phone rings and it is Mara, Mara herself. Mara is outside my apartment and she is smoothing our her dress and her tongue is a twizzler and her breath is ambrosia and every time she bats her eyelashes it is the season of spring.......

      My first writers desk was an aged stump of varnished oak that hunkered in the center of my room, brushing it's bulky girth against the wall of the bedroom that was once served as my nursery a decade before. The desk was a creative anvil; a wooded cutting board where every afternoon after track or cross-country practice I labored and peeled sliced syllables into pruned sounds; chaining egoistic thoughts together on very cheap lined paper.  I started writing in autumn of '94. The earth was a leafy nest of foliage the color of wet candy wrappers. I was just commencing with my Junior year at Manual High school. It was sixth months after Kurt Cobain dished a solitary anguished bullet inside his temple. I was romantically tethered (as seems to happen) with a girl I had met in Europe who wanted nothing to do with me.  And I started writing.  I come from a family of musical prodigies. "We're not the Vonn Traps, we're the Von Behren's," I would tell people in high school. "Although I feel 'trapped' in a symphonic cacophony sometimes!" Both my sisters coasted through youth and college tightly strapped to polished-wooden instruments. Beth sawed a rosin-laced bow across the frontal spin of her cello. Jenny whistled her limbs nightly across the bridge of a violin. From ages 8-12 all I remember is a tautly stringed nasal-suzuki squeal that somehow spelled out 'Twinkle-Twinkle Little Star" in a variety of contorted key changes.  My parents also possesed a zeal for music. Mom directed handbells at the Old Lutheran chruch we attended and played the organ. My Dad used to scribble and record christian folk songs on our front porch. My parents also (?) were dilettante dancers and even into the first years of college I vividly remember hearing my father galloping in his socks, swiftly trotting syncopating shuffle-ball-change steps across the kitchen floor.  I don't have a musical bone in my body and just last night, when I was driving around with Uncle Mike under a beautiful cholrine blue pre-autumnal sky and I started orally chiming out the refrain from Greg Brown's song "China,"Uncle Mike turned to me and wryly inquired what I did with the money.  "Money, what money?" I volleyed my nonplused response back into his ear lobes.  "The money your parents gave you for singing lessons." Michael said, smiling so I could see his silver fillings. Uncle Mike loves doing this. Everytime I think I say something witty or quote "profound" Uncle Mike triumphs himself in annihilating my ego; quashing my own menial wit as easily as one might obliterate a pineta on Cinco de maya.  But growing up there was always music. Translucent bulbs stuffed with rococco shaped key- signatures, slim horizontal black rungs, pear-heavy whole notes ushering the flagged stems of the saluting half-and quarter, all delicately levitating up, through the ceiling, into the bedroom of an earnest young writer whose body was hunched like a question mark over his writers desk, flogging out sounds in either blue or black ink--the color of a bruise.  I was a 'Poe-it' (dual-syllable) I wrote 'Poe-ems', I devoured Whitman and Emily Dickinson; I tackled Ezra Pound and James Joyce. I wore vintage coats and smoked cheap cigars rolled from sweetned cardboard and sauntered around my neighborhood at dusk quoting T.S. (B.S.) Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" by heart, feeling all too certain at the duplicitous age of seventeen that surely Eliot had penned that particular poem with me in mind.   Let us go then, you and I, When the evening is spread out against the sky Like a patient etherised upon a table; Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets, The muttering retreats Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells: Streets that follow like a tedious argument Of insidious intent To lead you to an overwhelming question … Oh, do not ask, “What is it?” Let us go and make our visit.  In the room the women come and go Talking of Michelangelo.     Still to this day, Eliot's overly-antholgized literary offering still crackles a cordial nostalgia inside my ears, chimming British bells within my chest, reminding me of a confusing time when a young man decided to chase the smudged lavender coattails of autumn into the dancing flicker of a homecoming bonfire.  In my late teens and early twenties, I sailed off on my writers desk, leaving the port and drama of late-teen histrionics (and the the musical squeaks that innocently tapped through the walls of our house like mice) behind me, steering through the sewage of the english language with honest (though pretencious) elbow strokes, using cheap plastic pens for my paddle.  I wrote in spiral notebooks. Each notebook I would write the month and the year on the cover. By the end of my junior year I was convinced that verse had cosigned me with the moniker of immortality and I fully expected to see my painted visera posted above the Cafe in Barnes and Nobles invovled in a candid critque between Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck.  A decade ago I honsetly arrived at the rest stop of the english language for all the wrong reasons, namely to stroke my ego like a quill and to get people ( namely females) to acknowledge that I had a pulse. I was a failed athlete and like any high schooler, craved guidance and attention and an over all cultivating sense of purpose and life-orientation. I found that sense of purpose ( or at least sniffed it) in the inky drops those late teen age years offered. I found my minimum wage; found my freshman orientation, in those indulgent, overweight poems.   The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes, The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening, Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains, Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys, Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap, And seeing that it was a soft October night, Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.    And indeed there will be time For the yellow smoke that slides along the street, Rubbing its back upon the window-panes; There will be time, there will be time To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet; There will be time to murder and create, And time for all the works and days of hands That lift and drop a question on your plate; Time for you and time for me, And time yet for a hundred indecisions, And for a hundred visions and revisions, Before the taking of a toast and tea.  In the room the women come and go Talking of Michelangelo.    *  I began to tack quotes by other writers above my desk. Little 3 x 5 inch postcards. I had Joseph Conrad's famous Heart of Darkness proverb concerncing work antics, " No, I don't like work--no man does, but I like what is in the work, the chance to find yourself." I had Jack Kerouac's ON THE ROAD infamous bee-bop mantra staring me straight in the eye every time I squatted:  "The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say an uncommon-place thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles."  I had Plato's, "Know Thyself", Had an 'emotional epiphanic' quote from Ginsberg where he sanctify's the literary intergrity of my city in his poem 'Howl' by saying "HOLY PEORIA"... I had the last verse of Dylan's "Times They ARE a Changin" which, although it's intrinsically a folk song, is probably one of the ten best American poems that completely harnesses the feeling of change in twentieth century.  The line it is drawn The curse it is cast The slow one now Will later be fast As the present now Will later be past The order is Rapidly fadin'. And the first one now Will later be last For the times they are a-changin'  I had a little known quote from Anne Sexton thumb tacked next to a picture of Walt Whitman. The quote was from a letter she wrote to a young poet in which she encourages him to quit behaving like a poet and concentrate on the craft of writing itself. "Just write every day and let the publishing aspect worry about itself....fight for the poem!!!!"  To this day that's by far the best advice I've ever received on writing and possibly on the craft of living as well.  * And indeed there will be time To wonder, “Do I dare?” and, “Do I dare?” Time to turn back and descend the stair, With a bald spot in the middle of my hair— [They will say: “How his hair is growing thin!”] My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin, My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin— [They will say: “But how his arms and legs are thin!”] Do I dare Disturb the universe?    In a minute there is time For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.    *  The oak desk began to get full with chopped slices of papers. My writing became more and more indulgent and so--called 'erudite'. Everything I wrote was planetary heavy. I took sick pleasure in exhausting the reader in a basin-vortex of blurred imagery. My vocabulary was riddiculous; ingesting copious amounts of James Joyce and glorifying the fact that my avatar Kerouac, also, was rather clueless when it came to punctuation, didn't help matters. My writers desk became a guillitone-- a syntax slaughterhouse where, all too-sure of my own genuis, I bludgeoned through sentences and storylines as fast I could, lacerating the eyesight of my diminutive (often imaginary) audience with sprinkled blisters and the occacional sty.  In 98, after four years of writing (drooling) black and blue-ink ponds my grandmother died. I watched as her wooden rectangle slipped into the earth (two patches away from where my dad is now) and I watched my relatives swindle and cozen my father into purchasing a suburban brick oven, that, in a period of less than two deades would roast two grandparents, one great-grandparent and eventually incinerate my father himself. I'd like to think that if my relatives knew that Dad had less than a half-decade's fuel left in him that they would have granted him what should have been rightfully his gratis; but knowing them, they still would have hoodwinked him and milked his very Ned Flanders modesty for all it was worth...one of my Aunt just purchased another SUV.  "It's VENAL!" I adamantly screamed at my dad, six years ago. "They're trying to market grandma's carcass. They're trying to make a profit off of her death. If they really wanted to "keep grandma's house in the family" they'd just let you have it. Besides, you're the oldest."  Dad was modest. His siblings resided in areas of affluence, near my grandmothers brick hovel. Our house, though it contained music, was located near in Peoria what is known as "THE HILL". The Hill overlooks the south side, poverty, crime, destitution. I can't entirely blame my father for moving. We never had a car stolen or had to refasten the rim of a basketball hoop since we moved into Grandma's. There would be no gang signs on our garage or loud sub-woofers heavily thumping outside our house at three in the morning. But ever since we moved, part of the music that once coated the inside of our house like fresh paint, moved as well. I can't blame my father for moving, but I can give my avaricious relatives the finger for making a commodity of my grandmothers corpse. Money is perhaps the worst exchange to happen between mammals since dogmatism and politics entered the realm of religious discourse. Contrary to the adage, money sometimes buds within the bark of a geanological tree. Blood changes color as it passes through the membrane of flesh; the color of money is somehow always stained green.  *   And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully! Smoothed by long fingers, Asleep … tired … or it malingers, Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me. Should I, after tea and cakes and ices, Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis? But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed, Though I have seen my head [grown slightly bald] brought in upon a platter, I am no prophet—and here’s no great matter; I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker, And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker, And in short, I was afraid.  And would it have been worth it, after all, After the cups, the marmalade, the tea, Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me, Would it have been worth while, To have bitten off the matter with a smile, To have squeezed the universe into a ball To roll it toward some overwhelming question, To say: “I am Lazarus, come from the dead, Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all”— If one, settling a pillow by her head, Should say: “That is not what I meant at all. That is not it, at all.”  And would it have been worth it, after all, Would it have been worth while, After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets, After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor— And this, and so much more?— It is impossible to say just what I mean! But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen: Would it have been worth while If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl, And turning toward the window, should say: “That is not it at all, That is not what I meant, at all.”  *  In 1998 my writers desk got shoved into a side corner in grandma's basement, surrounded by moldy carboard squares with my Grandmother's name written on them. From early 1999 until last month, I've moved an estimated (count 'em) twenty times. I've lived in co-ed dorms where my room was always the designated smoking lounge. I've lived in boarding houses where my roommate was an ex-con and harvested psychedelic shrooms on the side. I moved back into my parents basement, lived in a historical 1844 Mansion (for 13 months!-note year of mansion), lived in the country, in between green sheets of corn and crakerbarrel dirt roads. I lived in a caretakers house in a run down Jewish cemetary that's ironically on the same street where Uncle Mike and I live now ( damn four year cycle,) I lived in a dilapidated house with God-knows how many cats, a Playboy pinball machine and numerous 'transients' who would come in and crash, eat all the chips, slurp all the soda and spend countless hours monopolized in front of my roommates playstation while me and a few others labored to make ends meet and afford rent.  Come 1998 I was completely indecipherable as a writer. I was purely a James Joyce sycophant; a verbal toady who somehow got off on belittling other human beings. I hurt many people in the name of "literature." I was exactly like that undergraduate professor we've all had who got off on publically correcting your grammar and took great pride in slathering blood-red comments in the margins of your thoroughly rehearsed term paper.  This happens to writers all the time. One truism that somehow slipped out from the final draft of The Artist's Way (along with 'Frugal Living for the Wayfarer Artist Tucked in You' portion) is that trying to market your art as a product TAKES TIME. A really good novel may take four to six years to complete and an additional three-four years trying to get into print. We live in an acclerated Starbucks-locomotive dot.com driven society where fifty percent of all marriages end in the first ten years. Pardon my candor, but if most people can't commit at least a decade to the purported 'Love of their lives'-how the hell are they going to rededicate and discipline themselves to serving the global literati?(Grade school kids even have "accelerated reader.")  Realize that most of the great writers (think Hawthorne, Whitman, and Mellville) never really made it in their lifetimes, but they never stopped writing. Being an impecunious chronicler of the human condition myself, I don't think it was " Posthumous Literary fame" or pedagogical pretension that madly drove them back to their writing carrels on a nightly basis (although I'm certain it drove the sporadic snootiness of Joyce and Pound). I think the writers whose corpus transcends the realm of literary conventions had simply fallen in love tinkering with their hobbies; and that personal joy culled from stretching out that perfect sentecne or polishing that serene image rivals any accolades or award that I know.  After slobbering fulsome sentence after fulsome sentence I realized that I never really wanted to write, as much as I wanted to be known as a writer. My hero Jack Kerouac was purely an image writer; he looked like an erudite fifties-greaser who'd debauch your daughter on his Harley outside the sock-hop inbetween gulps of Proust. I honestly don't believe the literary hoi poloi would have devoured his 'hi-brow' hedonism had Jack Kerouac been middle-age, over weight, slighly balding with B.O.  So I behaved like Jack Kerouac, emulating his so--called literary lifestyle. I fingered cigarettes. I twisted my syntax to elevate my own solipsistic view of the world. I volleyed my professors theories back into their faces. I coveted the english language to my own whims and madly scribbling vulgar xeroxes of life, which, like Kerouac's. were almost 100 percent autobiographical and sometimes stale.  When I finally did fish out my writers desk from my parents basement, it was moved into the 1844 mansion, where, with my new laptop, I would slap assaults and inquiries; turgid, feeble images into the brow of Microwsoft Word.  For a long time, my writers desk, the simultaneous manger and bridal-suite; that stump where I saddled my eleavted thoughts, became nothing more than a bar stool; it's author; it's sole inhabitant, the biggest lush on tap.   No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be; Am an attendant lord, one that will do To swell a progress, start a scene or two, Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool, Deferential, glad to be of use, Politic, cautious, and meticulous; Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse; At times, indeed, almost ridiculous— Almost, at times, the Fool.    I grow old … I grow old … I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.  Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach? I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach. I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.  I do not think that they will sing to me.   I have seen them riding seaward on the waves Combing the white hair of the waves blown back When the wind blows the water white and black.  We have lingered in the chambers of the sea By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown Till human voices wake us, and we drown.  * A few months after my own father's death I moved out from the mansion and lived itinerantly. Mother had already denied me access into her house "I still want to know you Dave," although she allowed me to store my broken bookcases and what little furniture I owned in her (grandma's old) garage. A meeting with mother meant an appointment with failure. I love my mother very much but she's never once supported or encouraged my writing. Blithe Baptist that she is...it means very little to me that my mom doesn't support my hobby (or art, or writing) but it means quite a bit to me that she doesn't support me. I couldn't tell you what it would mean to me if mom would spontaneously drop by my work tonight, ask me how things are going and take me out for a cup of coffee. It would mean more to me than anything I've blogged or written this summer (even the bloggs I refuse to post!!!)  I haven't had a writers desk or a "conducive" writing area for over three years. I've learned to flourish around noise and studious fracas; learned to write in computer labs where no one speaks english. I've been blessed (Greatest greatest blessing) to have a job, where, inbetween calculating time cards and scanning out Reserve materials, I can slip into Microsoft word and drain myself empty. Even though the job pays shit (basically just pays for food and schooling), I honestly can't beat the benefits.  Most importantly I've learned (and continue to learn) as Stephen King says, "Life isn't a support- system for art. It's the other way around."  "Blessed is he who preferreth his brother before himself." Is a golden Baha'i proverb. My wish for those reading this is to never stop chasing that elusive autumnal sunset from that moment when you realized in youth, that a lil' bit of gold, a lil' bit of longing, a lil' moment of eternity, yearned to leak out from the tips of your fingers. To never stop dreaming. Never stop giving. Art serves as a catheter for life when we need spiritual nourishment. But Art, in all it's beautiful timeless facets, is subserviant to the needs of human beings. You yourself, my friends, are vehicles of the light (God knows you've helped me to see) and, in the words of my former mentor Kerouac, don't be afraid to burn, burn, BURN!!!!!!!!!!

      Here's how the Councourse badgers me at work on a fairly consistent basis:  Concourse: "Why don't you go up to the secretary Lilith  and ask how her mom's doing? You know her mom just had a stroke."  David: "Hell no. Lilith's been pms'ing out of control the last year. She called me drunk and then called Brenda drunk and even chewed out Brenda's kids. Hell if I want anything to do with her."  Concourse: "It doesn't hurt to smile and to show a lil' support every now and then."  David: "........."  * once again, humbled......

      Since I've just finished a very sodden conservative bowl of Quaker Oatmeal with former president Richard Nixon( Good Old Dick Nix even booked me a cool hotel room and taped our entire conversation, don't worry, he says will be out of 'Nam shortly) I decided, based on Daniela's cyber- assesment of my spiritual proclivities, to research Christian Science. The first person I thought of was my old German tour guidess, incidentally the only Christian Scientist I've ever met way back from '96, Miss Airlie Scott, whose name I googolized and viola, there she is red hair and all (although I still think she looks a tad Dylan Thomasish in the face) a fully accomplished swanky Jazz singer in London....Airlie was my tour guide in Munich and I totally tried to seduce her with hubristic training-bra poems, only I fell short. She would encourage me and smile at me and more or less humor the unbidden advances of a very foppish high-school senior. I remember writing her a poem about, what else, human suffering and human longing and the ever curvaceous shape of the human heart and I read it to her afterhours in my slow, poetically lited voice and afterwards she sort've looked at me like I was giving a lecture on Fire safety to felllow inmate patients.... Oh well, nothing beats seeing a former muse blossom into fruition in her career (it verify's that you yourself have good taste and high standards), especially if it's a professional career in the arts. Attagirl Airlie!!! Next time I find myself bashing around England I'll make sure to meander into one of your smoke-filled hovels and applaud your silky-voiced bee-bop scat!!!!  Since I'm apparently more of a Christian Scientist than I am male, here's a totally pointless list of fellow scientists I share the reading room with:  Marilyn Monroe - actress Carol Channing - actress Robert Duvall - actor Jean Harlow - actress  urlLink Alfre Woodard  - actress ("Star Trek: First Contact"; "The Core"; etc.) Ellen DeGeneres - comedian; actress  urlLink *  Alan Young - actor ("Mr. Ed")  urlLink Mickey Rooney  - actor Jean Stapleton - actress ("All in the Family") Georgia Engel - actor ( "The Mary Tyler Moore Show") Joan Crawford - actress (What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?; Flamingo Road; Possessed; Grand Hotel, and dozens more)  urlLink Ginger Rogers  - actress, dancer Doris Day - actress, movie star Spalding Gray - actor (The Killing Fields, True Stories, Beaches, Straight Talk, King of the Hill); theatrical monologuist; writer (Impossible Vacation)  urlLink *  Val Kilmer - actor, movie star (Red Planet; Pollock; The Prince of Egypt; The Saint; The Ghost and the Darkness; The Island of Dr. Moreau; Batman Forever; Tombstone) Bruce Campbell - actor ("Evil Dead; Evil Dead II; Congo; Icebreaker; Demolitionist; The Hudsucker Proxy; etc.) Danielle Steele - popular American author  urlLink Jonathan Carroll  - author  urlLink *  Richard Bach - famed author of Jonathan Livingston Seagull and other books  urlLink *  John Hughes - former editor of Christian Science Monitor and spokesman for U.S. State Department; first editor of the Deseret News who was not a Latter-day Saint  urlLink Cindy Adams  - journalist, newspaper columnist  urlLink Kay Kyser  - famed musician, big band leader Mike Nesmith - of the Monkees Jim Henson - famed puppeteer ("Muppets"; "Sesame Street")  urlLink *  David Unger Hart - puppeteer  urlLink Tommy Vardell  - professional football player (NFL)  urlLink Shannon Miller  - gold medal-winning Olympic gymnast William Webster - FBI and CIA director Alan Shepherd - astronaut, first American in space H.R.

      Here is how petulant David relentlessly argues with the Concourse on sometimes a nightly basis.  David (aggrieved, emotionally jaded, just a tad bit livid b/c he's been on the clock nonstop since the first BUSH adminstartion ): "I'm sick of working all the goddamn time. I'm sick of Indian engineering students with crippled english always coming up to me and sticking their ID's in my face like I'm a vacant ATM machine. I'm sick of kids from the suburban North Shores with short haircuts and no brains and daddy's Trust fund getting pissy with me. I'm sick of working all the time!!!!  Concourse (magnanimous, yet with firm lip): "Your job is simply to serve. If you want to make it as a writer some day you're going to have to learn to serve and to be an amicable host. If you want to make it as a husband, as a lover, as a complete human being, you're going to have to learn to serve."  David (letting his hair down, thinking about Metallica songs): "But I'm sick of serving. I'm sick of wallowing in ashes. I'm sick of not being able to make it."  Concourse (sounding very much like adage-adhering bald headed lotus guru):  "You 'make it' every time you 'write it', you know that too."  David (bitchy, whiny): "But...."  Concourse: (sounding very much like Joseph Campbell when Campbell comments on the Buddha "Joyful participation in the suffering of the World Look at Mike. Look at Dave McDonald. Look at other humans who inspire you...."  David: "But...."  Concourse: "Quit making distinctions between your life and your ability to give."  DAVID: (emphatically): "I'm working myself to death. My family's disowned me, my..."  Concourse: (sounding exactly like czech rose danilea; "You sulk too much Mistuh D."  David: "Alright. Fuck preppy kids from Chicago. I'm not going out like that."  Concourse (thinking David could pick more applicable words form his vocab than 'fuck' all the time): "You know what your job is---you know what your duty is. Just worry about the writing. things will take care of themselves.  David(taking deep breath, trying to quell urge for emotionally-sating smoke): Just serve. That's how I'm living yo.

      Today is Uncle Mike's Birthday!!!!!!!!  He sixty-one going on a strong sixteen. Energized by a perpetual youthfulness, curious about everything and a perennial pain in my ass, but god love 'em, what a man! Don't know where I'd be without 'em (probably wouldn't be bloggin', that's for certain...) He's perhaps one of only a handful of people that I know of who has given their lives for a cause greater than themselves....and have done so in a manner that doesn't involve/encourage ego suckeling or green tongue laurel licking...--that's what true mysticism is...sloughing the ego and identifying yourself within the frame of the collective other--As Rumi's teacher, Shams of Tabriz wrote:  I You He She We In The Garden of Mystic Lovers These Are Not True Distinctions  (Tell me that's not a precursor to baha'i antics).    *  "How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth," According to Milton, "Stol’n on his wing my three-and-twentieth year!My hasting days fly on with full career,But my late spring no bud or blossom shew’th." Read this morning that the average age for the US men's basketball Dream Team this summer is 23.6 years. which made me think (botched basketball visionary that I am) about where I was when I was 23 and half---namely it was January 2001, nine months before 9-11. Financial fetters and third-shift employment (as well as a family suicide-remember cousin Joey in your prayers- and my parents perpetual vocal support in their son's forever failure) had made it impossible for me to wrap up my junior semester. I had approximately 150 pages of a manuscript, typed, that I tucked under my arm and toated everywhere I went.  It was January 2001. The entire month of January was caked in grey cigarette snow. In exactly one year my dad would be diagnosed. I remember watching my mom raise her hands in prayer in front of the television screen when Georgie W. was sworn in. I remember my sister coming down to my bedroom informing me in a hoity-toity manner that she thought I was a good writer and would make it someday, but mom and dad really didn't want to have their oldest son living in their basement. Beth was a 'pageant-queen' and she strutted around the house like Mary-lou retton.  I was an habitual pot smoker (justifiably, if your parents don't support your dreams illegal substances always do) I doused my morning coffee with potent shots of J and B; I wrote as often as I could; 9 am to 9 pm, I was ostracized at the dinner table for not being a devout Christian; the night I audaciously read three discrete passages; from the Bible the Bhagava gita and the Dhampata respectively and for some reason felt compelled to show my parents that they were all saying intriniscally the same thing I was exiled from the dinner table brandished with blasphemy.  Twenty-three and a half year olds. I lived by the mantra (and still do) that if you keep on doing what you have to do things will happen. I knew if I kept chiseling out sentences things would occur and eventually they did: by March I was living in the cooloest house in Peoria ( a mansion, the same street where Uncle Mike lived) I had a job with, get this, BENEFITS ( a shit job but benefits are benefits nonetheless) and I had a laptop to pour my creative mettle into on a nightly basis...  Twney-three and a half and no where to go. Sixty-one and giving everything. Beautiful life we lead, my friends. It's a beautiful life indeed.

      I just read on-line that favorite director Linklater is doing a movie rendetion of  David Schickler's New Yorker short Story THE SMOKER. It appeared 4 years ago in the New Yorker when Schickler was maybe a year or two older than I am now. Natalie Portman's  going to play the young lascivious debutante, Nicole Bonner....   To have a shorty story published in the NewYorker before age thrity you have to either a.) have boobs or b.) kick it east-coast preppy school fashion!  Schickler honestly hasn't written shit since!!!! And his book KISSING IN MANHATTAN totally sucks!!!!!

      Uncle Mike is my biggest literary critic. The highest compliment he has ever given me (which was two years ago so it doesn't count) was, after a long-silence, "Well--it's pretty good for a human" (It was a 200 cigarette rushed out short-story about everyone's-favorite Yugoslavian refugee arteest, Jasna, titled WHERE ALL THE DREAM CHARACTERS DREAM, TOO)...Normally Mike always tells me one thing, "THE GENERAL POPULATION WON'T 'GET' IT!" At first it hurt my feelings but now I don't care. Time, like marriage, has a way of either attuning or abrading emotions. I once accumulated the gall to read one old blog entry to Mike (angels--about dear-olde-'dad'--note the 'add'-cronym,) and after the first paragraph Mike just chewed the piece up and spat it out--like it's sentences left a residual wheatgerm aftertaste on the top of his palate.  "Know your audience." He always tells me. "You've got to know your audience, and the general status quo won't be able to 'get' this.  This morning at brunch Mike shot out another "Know your audience" quip. The waitress at Denny's asked if we were ready to order and I simply requested another java refill and told her that we were 'musing' over the menu.  "Know your audience."  Over the word 'musing'!  I did manage to reel a few chuckles out of Mike anyoldway. I told Mike that since our house is intrinically (Know Your Audience) one big welcome matt for humanity, we were going to invite all the old, cantakerous (Know Your Audeince) Baha'is over to our living room, ingest copious (K.Y.A.) amounts of TANG (Know Your Decade) have an old fashion romping good time hootenanny (K. Y. D) and, at the moment when an almost universal oneness slivers throughout the spines of our guests, toast our sugary chalices and break out into a boisterous nasal-navigated carol of THOSE WERE THE DAYS compliments of Edith and Archie Bunker.    "Boy the way Glen Miller played,   songs that made the hit parade,    guys like us we had it made,    those were the days,       and you know where you were then,    girls were girls and men were men,    mister we could use a man    like Herbert Hoover again      didn't need no welfare states    everybody pulled his weight,   gee our old Lasalle ran great,    those were the days!"   Heavenly nostalgia. God I love that song! Reminds me of Saturday nights at Grandma's!!!! -Now if I can only manage to dish Edith's keening soporano out from my skull. There, that's better. ***  All my friends who kick it with me on a fairly regular basis (which are few because I work such odd hours) are all too well aware that I'm not too much of a cinematic buff and that I would rather monopolize endless hours pecking out spasmodic storylines than finding myself engulfed in a tinted moive theatre watching endless reels of previews, padding my pockets in search of soemthing clean to swipe off the accumulating mounds of butter on my hands; looking around, wondering why some people. You can tell I don't date much, "I know what we can do tonight honey, after I cook you dinner let's work on our pending literary opuses--together!!!!" On the other hand, Uncle Mike, my roommate and sporadic savior usually sees at least two movies every weekend. I know, who would've thought. Half the time he falls asleep during the first half-hour. Since the library has been snapping their doors shut extremely early on Friday nights this summer, I've been escourting Uncle Mike on his weekly cinematic jaunt. Here's very terse single-sentences synopisis about the films I've seen, mostly with Uncle Mike, since May.   Van Helsing...........sucked.  Steppford Wives. ...........Everyone was dressed like that were attending the Republican National Convention. Didn't like it cause Nicole Kidman looks exactly like my ex-girlfriend Atalissa May ( replete with angular nose, nonchalant smirk and lowercase a-cup boobs, only Nicole is far less uppity than Atalissa is in real life).  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban..............Loved it. J.K. Rawling's is no J.R.R. Tolkein, but she's the impeccable J.K. Rawlings nonetheless. Just like her books make young kids want to grow up reading (and writing) books.... the movie rendetion nothing short of magical.  Farenheight 9-1-1..............Still haven't seen it but I landed a free ticket from the Green party.  Spiderman 2..................Did you hear that Kristen Dunst is single again? Ohmigod! She was Amy in Little Women ten years ago!!!! That would totally placate my hardcore crackerbarrel well-read Little Women fetish...oh, yeah, movie was amusing, but Doc. Octopuss's claws reminded me of something a third Reich surgeon would use to perform a colonoscopy.  King Arthur...........I would rather load up on insipid Prince Valiant comic strips and clean mideval stables than be coerced into sitting through KING ARTHUR again.....My dad's name was arthur, so I liked the title. lancelot looks like he could be peddeling Viagra in Sicily. Guinverre never gets naked; instead she turns into an extra from BRAVEHEART at the end.  I, Robot..................attack of the Crash Test Dummies, not the mmmmm...mmmm..mmm kind. That might have made the film more palatable, but not by much. We need more of Philip K. Dick's books made into movies...oh look, Richard Linklater who composed and directed BEFORE SUNSET is working on a script for A SCANNER DARKLY.  BOURNE IDENTITY..............Actually kind of liked it. The bulk of the flick is set in Germany which is genealogically soothing. Matt damon's girlfriend at the beginning reminded me a lot of my beloved blogging co-hort daniela, but damnit she died! ( Damon's girlfriend-not daniela...)  THE VILLAGE....................M. Night Shyamalan wrote this after spending Thanksging holiday at Lincoln's New Salem. Sort of like the Scarlet Letter meets PASSOVER. Beautifully rustic milieu which made me want to sell my book fast so I can move out in the country and brew coffee over a campfire while getting lost in lavender buccolic sunrises. Uncle Mike liked it but we both TOTALLY predicted the ending....Ron Howard's daughter sees unbroken dead people manifesting themselves in the crop circles.  That's it. BEFORE SUNSET FINALLY crawls into an INdependent theatre here in P-town this weekend! If you open the Arts section of the New York Times today you'll see an advertisement for BEFORE SUNSET boasting that it is 'THE HIGHEST RATED MOVIE OF THE SUMMER'....Indeed, it is, and they don't make movies like that anymore because they don't make people who want to feel real anymore. Almost makes me nostalgic...(sniff)...   People seemed to be content.    Fifty dollars paid the rent.   Freaks were in a circus tent.    Those were the days!       Take a little Sunday spin,    go to watch the Dodgers win.   Have yourself a dandy day    that cost you under a fin .       Hair was short and skirts were long.   Kate Smith really sold a song.    I don't know just what went wrong!    Those Were the Days!"

      Will get some new lenses tomorrow (finally)...beware of far less typo's in pending blogs...also, thanx to the death of my co-workers Grandmother, I get TWO weeks worth of extra hours at Work--which will Generously help to defray costs for College this semester.....ahhhhh, college, the best decade of my life. In America everything has a barcode....some commodities just take longer than others to scan.
