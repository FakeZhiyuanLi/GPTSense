      So I copied after Jonelle, I thought if I have to read hers then she has to read mine. I'm waiting for a client who wanted to see some houses to call me...Real Estate is difficult because you never know when you'll be working and when you won't and if you don't sell you don't get paid. But I don't have to put my son in day care, so it's worth it. This mom thing is the hardest thing I've ever done because every decision I have to weigh how it will effect him.

      Death is inevitable for us all, but sometimes in our lives it seems more real. My parents and I had eaten with a couple on Sunday that was parted today by death. The man, not much older than my father, died of a heart attack while bush whacking his farm. His son ended up breaking his sternum, because he was trying so hard to bring him back. Two days ago I cooked for a man that is no longer breathing. It hits home. It is not the man that suffers, he is a Christian and is now with God, but it is the rest of us that he left behind. I can't sleep tonight for another very real issue that confronts me in the shadows of his death, unbelievers. If he died without knowing Jesus how much more would we mourn. Would I stay so silent about my faith if I knew how long some have left to live? Does my quietness mean I don't care? Does it mean I don't truly believe? Why am I more afraid of what someone might think of me than where they will end up? It is dangerous that this topic is so cliche, because people hear and are unafraid... Or are they. Why does death affect us so much? Why are we so concerned with staying alive? The medical profession makes millions on prolonging life, Millions are spent on scientific discoveries that will increase our time here and for what? What are we so afraid of?

      Moments of pleasure turn spitefully  to jab at my doubts.   Taking turns holding the babe  pass him back when your through amusing yourself with him,  pass him back for my 24/7 turn.  Show him off when the mood hits you.  Babe at my breast all day  sucking me dry,  conversation with the birds,  all alone.  Feeling hopeless... I shouldn't have those thoughts.  Motherhood is so long and mine never turns off.  Not laughing together with a daddy proud of his latest accomplishments.  Want to stay in bed today,  everyday.  Throw me a couple hundred  that's all our worth.  Some bills to front some bills.  My time.  my lonliness.  feeling  so unloved,  so worthless,  so stupid  and so used.  My body wasn't made for this,  my pelvic bone purged  and the pouch never heals,  just thickens  and the dried blood stains my oversized under,  musty and thickening.  And they call me back to prod again,  won't leave my women hood alone.  Ironic how many ways a man can rape a woman.

      The weather outside causes the top of the glass,  right above where the liquid line drifts, to condescend and glaze the surface.  The ice chunks fuse and float  loosing air bubbles at a chaotic rhythm,  no pattern,  cracking the ice.  The portion below the small mound of glacier is dead  and still.  Random lines form, racing down the glass,  slow release,  running it's course,  encircling the coaster with my name etched inside.

      "What a sweet little boy... I'm sure your husband is proud." "I'm not married..." "What a strong little fella... his dad must be pleased." "He doesn't see us... much,  stood us up today in fact... suppose to take his son to the zoo,  picnic."  Ashamed to speak  that I'm alone in this. Ashamed to say  that I am unwanted... not good enough for him  to do the right thing. Ashamed of myself for expecting something  that never arrives. Ashamed of not being stronger... this does affect me  deeply. Ashamed of faking that I'm okay... I am hurt,  I am wounded,  I feel alone,  lonely.

      It is not okay to show up whenever you feel  like spending time with me. It is not okay to give money whenever you feel  guilt. It is not okay to pretend  you are someone you are not.  Don't use lies about us to  appease your friends,  to make them think you're  cool.  Don't act like you don't ask for much... You ask for the world.  You want the rights of a father... Give him my last name,  let me see him whenever I want,  let me show him off to my friends,  let me take snapshots to prove I came by,  once. No responsibilities! I won't have a not okay role model for my son. He won't grow up thinking that's how a father behaves.  He will have a healthy family.  He will be a great father to his children.

      The worries are endless... I'm always thinking about the future and if I'm making the right decisions for my son. He's only three months old and I already have to start thinking about where he is going to go for kindergarten. I talked to a friend who is a teacher in the public schools and she says that private schools have a stronger curriculum in reading than the public schools have. She believes that being a strong reader early is the key to a successful education. The ideal situation for a child, in her opinion, is homeschooling. According to her it would only take three hours a day to teach a child what they would learn in a day at school. I agree with her that the best option is homeschooling, however I don't know if I believe it is the best for their social skills. Another friend of mine believes it isn't bad for their social skills unless you actively try to keep them away from society. There are plenty of groups where they can develop their social skills i.e. playdates, church, other homeschoolers; the list could go on. However, if he is always with me and other children that I choose for him to be around, then how will he establish his individuality? How will he make decisions that I can be proud of and decisions that disappoint me?  Isn't that how you learn not to repeat mistakes? When he is finally 'released' into the real world where I can no longer protect him, will I have provided him the key factors for him to swim? If I am his teacher, he knows only success. As the only student, he is conditioned to believing he is the best. Will the disappointment of finding out that their are others smarter than him, crush him? After years of being the only, will he handle the concept that he is only one of the many? I know that very few people read this, but if you have read this and have any insight, maybe even personal experiences, I would love to hear about them.
