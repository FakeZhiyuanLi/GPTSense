      The kids lost their game today. Dominik wasn't able to block a shot and the other team won 6-5. Dom said it's all his fault. This is what I hate about coaching. I am having a team meeting at practice on Monday so we can talk about losing and winning and sportsmanship.  I know that Leslie and I just broke up but there is someone I "like".

      This has been a somber holiday for my family and I. It doesn't feel like we have much to be thankful for. I know that we do, it's just hard to concentrate on everything we have to be thankful for at this moment in time.  April and I didn't go out last night. I feel horrible for canceling since I was the one who asked. I will make it up before I leave. It was not the right day yesterday after working out funeral details. I'm taking care of most of it since Vy-mom is feeling overwhelmed.

      My Step-Dad, Kurt, died Friday night. His death was unexpected and shocking.   My Thanksgiving plans have changed a bit; there are plans I'm changing so that I can spend time with my family (mainly with Vy-mom). I'm sorry for not returning calls but I know everyone understands that I'm going through a tough time right now.  I have lost not 1 father but 2 in my life time.    This is my revised Thanksgiving itinerary:     November 25:  On plane the whole day. Arrive @ Sac airport 9:15pm   November 26:  Funeral home with Vy-mom, 5pm Kaci's birthday dinner. Date with April @ 10pm   November 27:  Thanksgiving with both families  November 28:  Lunch with Jack, Reya, Cassie, Anthony and his fiancee. Dinner with Cory and Ash.  November 29-December 2:  Funeral & memorial (for family only by request of my step-grandparents and Vy-mom. I wish some of you could be there with me because you knew and loved Kurt).  December 3:  Plane leaves 1am     A tidbit of fmily history, so you won't get confused:    1. My parents are Julianna and Tyler. They were divorced when I was 6 but remained friends.  1. My mom remarried when I was 13 but it ended in divorce a year later. 3. My dad, Tyler, married my step-mom, Vyvian (AKA Vy-mom). My dad died when I was 9. Vy-mom had become a large part of my life, she and my mom (Juliana) have been good friends since my dad's death.  4. Vy-mom got remarried when I was 11 to Kurt. He was a very important part of my life when he didn't have to be.

      Headed over to my homegirl E's house last night, got drunk and spilled all my thoughts out to her. (Sorry to burden you with my crap E.)  There are only 9 more days until  _________________.   I hate shopping but E went with me to find some new threads. Adrianna and Carl will be staying with me for the next few days, they got here to NY today while I was at work and I just found out  I'm going to be an uncle!  I was the last to know.   I'm trying out a ne blog. Let me know which you like:  urlLink http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=burningmysoul   This break up is more like a divorce. Leslie took B-Fish (Blunterfish). She fucking took my fish!  There is a special bond between a man and his fish, mother f%$@er!  If we have to have a custody battle over B-Fish I'm bouts to duke it out. I went down to the dealership today and took my name off her car because I forgot about it until the bill came in the mail.

      Mom finds out about blog:  urlLink http://www.theonion.com/3944/news3.html   Hi mom! I used to do drugs, I have sex with everyone and I drink. So what of this information didn't you already know? The only thing my mom would learn from reading my blog is that I'm not the teenager she was grounding every week.      Here are some things my mom has found by snooping or walking in on me:    In middle school she found a bottle of jack daniels in my backpack. At 16 She took my car away for a month after my sister told her I'd driven home drunk from a football party.  She found a roach in my desk drawer and ecstasy in my wallet. That same year she found Don's crackpipe and a freshly rolled blunt in my room. She also found steroids, acid, and shrooms a few times.  She walked in on a 3 some. From the age of 15 until I moved out at 18 she walked in on me having sex in my room, her room, the den, bathroom, garage, in my car parked in the garage, the kitchen, backyard and on the stairs. She's walked in on drunk sex, sex on drugs, video taped sex, sex with toys, sex with more then one girl in a week. She's walked in on it all including me pleasuring myself numerous times. I had a lock on my door but she had a key.  We are on good terms now that I am old enough to know better. To thank her for putting up with me I will buy her a mercedes someday.

      If you don't know, I have quite a few female friends that I've aquired since my frat days. Like Emmaleigh.  Em and I went to Bennotes after work for coffe and she ran into her ex, Jacob. He is a tall, lanky, barely 20-something looser that didn't even have a shot with her until  he started to talk to her, complement her and hang on her every word. He came over to our table and engaged in small talk for a hot minute. When he left she leaned in and wispered 'I just don't know what it is about him, but I feel something.'   There seems to be one common bond between my lady friends: they all still have a soft spot for the exes. In my personal experience I have never wanted an ex back for anything but a one night stand or a week fling. But I didn't give a damn about any of them.     I give a damn about Leslie.   I don't want to be with her again. Fuck I don't know what I'm taking about. It's 6AM and I slept 4 hours.

      I got my truck detailed. Mmm it's sexay now.   Leslie came over tonight and we had a long talk. Talks about things we left unsaid. We both cried. We don't know what's next but we'll see. I have something I need to do first and thinking to do. She put the choice in my hands: 1. Break up for good (we are broken up as of 2 months ago) and don't stay friends.  Leave things how they are and don't look back. 2. Break up and stay friends. 3. Get back together and break up when she goes back to Ohio in May. 4. Get back together, she moves her stuff back in and she moves with me in July to CA. I wait it out until she is ready to get married or we break up later down the line.  The fact of the matter that I have to be the one to decide what our future together or part will be is making my decision easier. The signal that she could take me or leave me is so loud and clear it should be a billboard in Times Square.

      My friends Nadine and Akia invited me to dinner last night. Those two get into trouble together and last night was no exception. After dinner we headed straight to Roxy Bar. I was DD so I only drank water but Akia had 4 shots and 3 mixed drinks.  I don't know how many Nadine had because she wandered off with Tony, a guy she knew. Well when Nadine joined us Akia was already hammered. She grabbed Tony and started kissing him then she led him off to the bathroom. Nadine went in there a few minutes later and yelled "she's fucking giving him a bj!" Akia came out, turned to Nadine and said "Your turn" so she went in! That's fucking straight out of a high school party. Damn the days way back when, prep'n girls for the future. They shared in high school and they share now.  I have work in an hour so I gotta get going. Trying to drive in the rain takes more time.

      Grandma is leaving tomorrow morning. She said she is here to see my new place and my new car but I don't believe her. She was sent by the family because the whole time she has been here I've heard "Leslie this, Leslie that"  Corey and his fiancee will be in Sac the same time I will be there, we're already planning a club night or bar night. I have not seen him since he left for England a year ago, we used to go bar hoping with our women every weekend back then. I'm looking forward to it but I'm looking forward to seeing a special lady just as much. If she doesn't back out.   I'll belong to you if you just let me through

      Why am I still awake? I have to pick up my Grandma at the airport in 3 hours, I have yet to sleep a nod. She is staying for three days just to come up and see my Leslie-free apartment. I have a hunch she is really coming to convince me that I need Leslie and can't live with out her. On the phone she said 'Nobody would make are more beautiful bride then Leslie. Talk to her, you will see how much you are meant to be together.'  I'll be frank, my family was in love with the idea of Leslie becoming part of our family. They adored her because she was smart, classy, and beautiful.  My own mother took her out looking for wedding dresses the day after we were engaged. My mother flew out to NY just to take my fiancee dress shopping! After she heard the news she jumped on the first plane she could catch, not to see me, but to see Les and to see the ring. That was 2 years ago.  Nobody in my family thought I would settle down. I proposed to her to prove my family wrong. I loved Les, not enough to marry her, but I thought it was the best thing to do. I loved her, my family loved her, my family loved her family, her family loved my family.   While I was living at home I can't even count the times my parents saw me with a different girl.  My mom has walked in on me having sex with different girls more times then I know. Then there was the time she walked in on a 3-some. She made me go to church and to temple everyday that year because I was 'unclean'. Fuck I was already unclean by that time and I was 15. I was raised both Jewish and Catholic so I have gone to church/temple more times then anyone I know. My Grandpa is a deacon and we had to go to two masses every Saturday night, two the next day then temple. I know the bible inside and out. My mom thought church was punishment but she was wrong because half the girls I brought home were from church.   They are sending my grandmother because they have the fear that without Leslie I will turn into Roderick they knew 4 years ago; trying to bed every girl in America and the one who will never settle down. If they only knew.  Les did not change me. I changed because there was something about being with ONE PERSON. I wouldn't go back to being the person my family and old friends knew for anything. I will have to convince my grandma of that so she will pack up her bags sooner then in 3 days.

      Had an intense phone conversation with the woman I really want. We want different things. I want to start something right now, I don't care if there thousands of miles separating us, but distance matters to her. Nevermind the fact we've known each other for several years. Nevermind the fact we have a connection. There is nothing left for me to do except wait until I move in July. She is bull headed and stubborn, I don't reckon she'll change her mind. Honestly my date with Malia wasn't great, it wasn't what I was expecting.  Malia was just a distraction because she's here, not to mention easy . Not that we had sex; we didn't, she wanted to. Shit, I wanted to. It didn't feel right. Has this 'player' been reformed? You could say that 4 years of a committed monogamous relationship changed me. After having that with Leslie I want it again. I am looking ahead, thinking about permanently settling down.  I want to get married and that time is coming soon. Never thought I'd say that eh? Damn what did everybody expect? I'm not 20 anymore. These 4 years have made a difference. The frat boy everyone knew is grown up paying my rent, bought a new truck, I have a career, granted it's not where I want to be but in a few years I will be "Dr. R. S. Kalabastia", rollin in the Benjamins. Thas right, initials only so I will feel professional. Fuck it, I'm still obnoxious.

      Malia wanted to go back to my house after our date tonight.  Did I revert back to my former ways or did I hold out for something (someone) better? We're going out again Friday night but that has nothing to do with the decision I made tonight.

      I just got offered a job at the hospital. It's at the front desk taking appointments in the pediatric ward. I talked to my step mom and she said I can stay with her when I move back until I find my own place. My mom won't let me move back in with her, she said "No, I am not having any boomerang children. If you move back then your sister will thnk it's ok to move back too" I saw Malia at the store, she asked me out tomorrow night. I have not dated in 4 years, and I am nervous.

      Leslie called me and asked me to dinner, I didn't go. Our relationship more or less should have ended 2 years ago. These past 2 years out of the 4, we were together out of convenience and fear of change. Les, you are not the one I've been thinking about. The next chapter of my life is just starting, without her (just the way it should be). I'm going to finish my med degree without her holding me back and I'm going to move back to CA where I belong.

      Kids won the game today 2-12. They worked hard in practice this last week.   I was not looking forward to coming home until she said "yes" to this:   I feel like I'm back in 7th grade writing a letter like this but when I tried to tell you over the phone what I am about to say when we last talked, you didn't seem interested or you were preoccupied with something else. I don't know if you are aware of this or not, but I like you. There I said it. I'm done hinting around. Now this is what I'm proposing: I am coming home for a visit sooner the I told you, in November, for two days only.  If you are interested, and I hope that you are, I think we should go out. On a date, just us. If you feel uncomfortable about that then bring a friend but I want to go out to dinner with you. I would never want to put you in a position where you would not feel comfortable.   I'm just asking for an hour and a half of your time, nothing more. I don't expect you to kiss me (or anything even beyond a handshake), I know that's not your style, all I want is a piece of your time, not your ass.  No pressure, no hidden agenda. I don't think it is unreasonable or asking too much of you. Now that I've put it out on the line what do you say? You have nothing to loose unless you say no. Then you'll be loosing a free dinner, company with an old friend and something else down the line perhaps. Think about it and get back to me when you're ready.   Derick Ro

      Ethnicity and moniker confusion:  I am "white" in appearance but my genetic makeup is mainly Middle Eastern. To clarify, my paternal grandfather is Jewish (from Jerusalem), Persian and Greek. My paternal grandmother is Cuban and Egyptian. My maternal grandfather is Irish, British and Indian (from India), while my grandmother is Irish.  My first name is derived from well-respected uncles: Rodney, Derek, Eric, Ricardo (Rick). The outcome of combining these names was Roderick. I am a man of many nicknames. What you know me by is determined by how you know me: Derick: family and their friends Eric, Erik, Erick: College friends, namely girls Ro: Frat bros, sports buddies Ricky: Uncle Ricardo and Aunt Geneanne  I have two middle names, Jordan and Sjimon, as well as a long Hebrew name and confirmation name.  Kalabastia is a relatively new surname, under 50 years old. It's a combination of my paternal grandparents' family names: Batista and Kalanopolous.   Put it all together and you get Roderick Jordan Sjimon Kalabastia. We do the hokey pokey and you shake it all around that's what it's all about.  Any questions?   Christmas plans: Arrive @ Sac airport 7:35am Christmas day Breakfast Christmas morning with friends, see April later, Mikel and Naejariella for dinner Flight leaves next day

      I can't say for sure but it appears as if a friend of mine is starting on a self destructive path. Out of all my female friends she is the one I can always count on and I do hope she feels the same. Get out of your pjs, shower, eat  something  because you can't survive on water and celery, go somewhere and think. Please come over. Call me. Don't shut me out. You live in Detroit but I swear I will come see you any time of the day at a moments notice.

      Women are unnecessary drama. Leslie was over late last night for a 'talk'. God, I swear, all the bad karma in my past is coming at me full circle x5 now. To make a long story short she    proposed    after telling me 4 months ago that she does not want to spend her life with me  when I proposed to her .   Working 2 full-time jobs is harder then I thought. I don't need the money but I need the experience. Also, I'm looking into IVY LEAGUE schools. Why settle for a UC? I want to return to CA to be with family, friends (and that one woman) but my education and career come first. My mom and Vy-Mom are encouraging an IL institution and as of late I couldn't agree more.

      I took my mom to Chanterelle for her 50th birthday dinner. My grandmother, Aunt Sloane, Uncle Maxwell, Great-Aunt Fatima, and Mal came along. My sister was not feeling well so she left before the main course. When we returned home Audra, my step sister, had a surprise party planned. We pooled our money together to buy her an Elsa Peretti platinum diamond ring from Tiffany's.  urlLink SEE THE RING HERE.  And I gave her diamond earings to match.  The  urlLink L ROEDERER CRISTAL  and mother's  urlLink favorite wine  were flowing until 1 in the morning when our guests started to leave.  My time in town was limited but I got the most out of it. I went back to Elk Grove HS to scare a few old teachers, visited with some old friends and most importantly spent time with my family.

      Corey was quick to point out I don't write much these days with the exception of a quick paragraph here or there.  I can't please everybody but here goes just for you Cor-ster.  Our flight was delayed 15 minutes due to bad weather. When we arrived in Sac it was mad windy and raining. Mal does not know my family and decided instead of staying at my house she will stay in a hotel. She rented a car and we were on our way. Mal found a salon in Laguna on the way n made an appointment for a whole beauty package tomorrow while I am with my mom.   I went to Avie's. We took Juniper (her dog) for a walk through the park when the weather cleared and took a quick walk to City College where I met her fiancee Bryant before his classes. My mom arrived later and we took a quick trip to Vic's (shiiiiit remember whan it used to be fucking Jumbo?).

The blondes name is Shannon, a friend of Erins, she is 19. I want a stable, healthy & committed relationship, I get a one night stand instead.  I'm heading west in a few hours to see my family and buy a new car. My arrival time is set for Friday if I drive the route that's planned. There is an amazing woman I want to see. I owe her an apology and it has to be done in person.

      My mothers did not take the news well that they might be grandmothers. They like Leslie but the case-in-point is that we are not married, we are not getting married, we are not together anymore and there are no plans to get back together. My grandmother looked as if she were going to have a heart attack. My mom cried. My step-mom said that if my father were alive to hear this he would be disappointed. The only person happy about this news is my sister who is pregnant herself.   The only thing that saved my sanity is knowing that my sister is on my side through this.

      I have been thinking about children. What would I name my children? How would I want to raise them? Would I raise them to be religious even though I am moderately religious myself?  It is a very real possibility that in 8-9 months I will have to deal with these issues. I had to stop at Macy's to buy my sister a baby shower gift and with out thinking I bought one for her and one for Les. I am ready to have kids I just wanted to be married first. Les and I are not even together anymore. This is not how I wanted things to be but if it was meant to be then the baby will be mine. In a way I want it to be because what if I don't get married? What if this is it? But then I know the right woman is out there and I don't want her to worry about another woman's child. I don't know what to think but I need everybody's support in this. I'm going home next week and I'm going to tell my family. Les and I have already discussed this. She thinks I should wait until she has the baby to tell them. I don't want to take them by surprise that way. I need to let them know what the situation is because I need their support through this most of all.

      Move in day.  urlLink This is my new apartment.    Neighborhood information:   Manhattan’s Upper East Side extends from 59th St. to 96th St. east of Fifth Avenue and is known as one of the most prestigious neighborhoods in which to live. The neighborhood consists of stylishly restored old mansions, luxury high rises, stately townhouses and several of the best co-ops/condos in Manhattan. This district includes access to some of the finest public schools as well as private elite schools such as Dalton and Brealey. Central Park is a simple westward stroll away. Art lovers will find that they can walk to favorite museums such as The Metropolitan, The Guggenheim, The Frick and The Whitney and also visit the famous auction houses of Christie’s and Sotheby’s. Posh boutiques and classy intimate restaurants enhance the area’s elegance. It is sophisticated yet comfortable enough to house many singles and young professionals.   A good place to raise kids, if I am having one. If This baby is mine it will change my life. It's likely that I will stay in NY.

      I have to admit that I've never been so scared as now. I'm scared for myself, this baby, Les, the other guy. No matter what the outcome is the lives of 2 people will have changed for the rest of their lives. An innocent baby will be on this earth. If I am the father I vow to make sure this baby will have a good life. I will be there like my dads were for me.

      Leslie is pregnant and there is a 50% chance I'm the father. There are to many thoughts racing through my head right now. After we broke up the 2nd time she was with her friend Steven. She has a doc appt to determine how far a long she is. I can not believe this is happening. I never thought something like this would happen to me.   Not like this.

      I will be back in the 916 in 3 weeks. Clear space on your calendars for me. My sister is getting so large now. She eats more then most QB's and LB's I know. Waiting for her to have this baby is torture on my mom because they moved in with her so they can save money for a larger place. She has to buy food 2x weekly.   Shailani and Forley's wedding is Saturday. My girl Shailani is getting married! I'm going to the wedding stag because I can't find a "date".

      My boss let me take time off work so mom flew me home last night. She didn't want to hear the news over the phone. I've told them already and now it's time to tell you guys: I am not going to have a baby. Thinking that you might be responsible for putting a life on the planet puts your own life into perspective. I wanted it to be me. Have you ever wanted something so bad and you were almost there only to have someone take it away from you? That's how I feel.  My grandmother (the Catholic one) always told me God only gives you what you can manage. This situation happened for a reason, and though I'm crushed, there are bigger and better things waiting for me in the next months. Now I must decide if I'm going to Harvard or Yale.

      Came to a realization that I don't understand as much Hebrew/Yiddish as I did in my childhood. This revelation came to be as my Great-Grandmother was cursing and damning me in her native tongue. The only sentence I was able to make out was "Ruah ainikle, nebach shanda fermished yetzet harah. Oy, vey is mir," roughly translated means "Wicked grandchild, it's such a pitty and disgrace that you messed up on an evil impulse. Oh, woe is me."   Other then that sentence I was able to figure out bits and pieces of what she was saying. She referred to sex as "chazerai" (disgusting stuff), kept waning on about marriage (kedushin) and how I have sinned (aveyra). She  referred to both Leslie and I as curva (whore) and the baby as a mamzer (bastard child).   Note to self: brush up on the language before next visit to Great-Grandma.

      My life is weird. My love life is even worse. As women age they grow to be even more unpredictable. One of those unpredictable women will be over soon. She made me listen to country music last night while she cried. Tonight she is making me watch Pretty Woman. Such minimal sacrifices in order to spend time with a friend. But I like chick flicks. They are feel good movies. I still can't handle watching the Wedding Planner. It makes me think of the wedding I would be planning right now with Leslie.

      The paternity test can finally be done next week. My emotions are running on high. A friend told me that no matter what the outcome of this situation is, my life will be forever changed and she's right. I've been worrying about my future. All the "what ifs" and questions. Les and I have been spending more time together. I'm worried she'll hurt me again.   These past 8 months of my life have been the hardest I've had to endure: Proposed to Leslie, she said no, we break up. My dad dies. Finally go on date with a certain lady friend I've been admiring since I met her, we get closer, I hoped to start something. Les and I reconcile then break up within a week. I get fucked up and have one night stand with Erin's best friend. Leslie comes out with the news that she is pregnant and there are two possible fathers, I'm one of them. I move from Spring Brook to Manhattan. Apply for grad school.   NOW WE WAIT FOR ANSWERS. Don't have unprotected sex, kids.   If this had happened 5 years ago, before I became a sensitive wuss, I would have been unfazed by it all.

      In the next few months, the trips I make to Sacramento will become less frequent. My family needs time to cool off and collect their thoughts.   Erin is helping me decorate my condo. It's a 3 bedroom so we best get crackin'. She's staying here for a few days because I don't feel like being alone right now. Her boyfriend Saul is at this studio making a sculpture for the balcony outside my room. I have piles of paperwork to fill out. I'm applying to Yale, Brown, Cornell, Dartmouth, Columbia, Harvard, PENN, Stanford. It would be idea if I got into Columbia so I can stay in New York.

      Since I returned home, packing and taking care of things before I leave has been my top priority. I shipped Cody & Ashlynn's wedding present to England, paid bills for the next month and took care of school bills. While I was in Sacramento, my family presented me with a check for my first semester. It's a gift from my parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles and friends of the family.   For the first time, Grandma Niya-Jina said she is proud of me.

      I'm going to be in Sac from Tuesday to Thursday. As August quickly approaches I realized that I don't want to leave NY for New Haven. I love Manhattan. The night life, the people, activities. I do have fun here, I know many of you think I don't because I never talk about it.   My favorite spot is Plan B ( urlLink http://www.planbny.com/home.php ). It's not as chill as Bouche Bar in East Village. Mixx Lounge ( urlLink http://mixxlounge.com/ ) is the spot Erin and I chill at when we need to catch up. We go to Groove Theory @ Mixx on Tuesdays for the hip hop.   In my experience, New York is the kind of place you should move to only if you have close friends near by. When I first started @ SUNYB it was hell. I didn't know anyone. I lived in the dorms and hated it. Ended up with a straight-edge roommate that went to bed by 9. When I moved into the frathouse I started having more fun. When I moved into my own place, off campus, as far away as I could get, I started to explore the area more. Sophomore year Bryce moved to NY from Elk Grove. We shared a place and  that  was the best time of my life.  I had met new people and was well known but when Bryce came my social life got even better. I had someone there to chill with who was one of my true friends. My new friends were great but I was missing my old ones, those people who'd been there for me and knew me better.   I have been in NY for the past 6 years. It's become comfortable. It wasn't at first. Now I have to uproot my life once more to New Haven and start over again.

      I partied it up in the Hamptons last weekend with Erin, Cody, Ashlynn, Jay, and Heather. Erin's parents own a summer home there so we took the opportunity to wreak havoc in the posh area. Some old frat buddies and Erin's old sorority sisters came down and stayed Saturday. It felt like being in college again, having the group together and partying our asses off. I haven't consumed so much alcohol in a 3 day period since I graduated college.

      In August I will be moving to New Haven, Connecticut. I made my final decision today that I'll go to grad school at Yale. I got into every school I applied for. It was a close call between Yale and Notre Dame but in the long run Yale was the best choice. After my education at Yale is complete I'd like to get my PhD abroad from Oxford.  You Californians will see me twice more before I start school, once before I leave for my trip and again before I start school.

      Sasianne and Nicholas rolled into town the same day I got back so I treated her to dinner as an apology for missing her 30th birthday. Happy belated birthday Sasi. We went clubbin but I cut out early.   I'm taking off on a spiritual quest from June 1-July 14. I originally planned to have a few traveling partners accompany me but decided I need to go it alone. The length of my trip has been extended to allow for more soul searching and give myself time to think about recent events. My destinations are Egypt, Vatican City, Tibet, Jerusalem, Italy, Greece and will finish in England so I can attend Cody and Ashlynn's wedding on July 10. I'm the best man so my presence is not optional.  Er will be apartment sitting for me while I'm gone.  Baseball season is back in full effect so my kids are hittin the cages more. They're throwing me a "goodbye" party towards the end of summer. I just told my soccer kids I won't be their coach this year and they all took it hard. I've been their coach for 3 years now for the reg season and indoor. It's going to be hard to leave them.

      I have to deal with demons from my trip today. I forgot how it feels to hurt someone you care about. I went on that voyage to figure out what I wanted from myself, life, relationships; to think about the kind of person I want to become. In retrospect, this trip did teach me about what I  don't  want to become: a carbon copy of my old persona.    To deny ones self of emotions will only bring heartache. And it has. That's why I'm here. Not to clear my own conscience, but to give explanations to someone who deserves them.  People keep asking me whatI "am" so here is a repost:  urlLink http://robastia.blogspot.com/2003_12_01_robastia_archive.html

      Did I ever tell you that in 2002 I was in a "hot bodies" contest with my frat bros? We dyed our hair blond, got tattoos and worked out 2x daily for 2 mons. The contestants had to lift some weights, get drenched in water, girls rubbed oil over us. It was insane shit. I won 4th place, my bros Thom Jordan won 2nd and Germaine Scott won 1st. Just found the pic on Cody's laptop. Email me and I will send you a copy. I look sweaty and nasty, so does the "hot bodies" model. It was a cheap ass contest and the models were not cute.  roderik_4k@yahoo.com     Where in the world is Ro Kalabastia?   Guess where I am, winner gets a prize.

      It's 8:52 here in Jerusalem. It's only the 22nd day into my this trip and already I've done and said things I regret. Funny how things seem like a good idea at the time. My actions have been unfavorable and my words hypocritical.  My mom and little brother are flying in today 'round noon and I can't wait to see them. I hear Kyle has a new girlfriend. Hard to believe he is a junior now. Wish I were there to spend more time with him.   I leave for Tibet in 4 days. Greece will follow and I'll end my voyage in England. Word to the wise: Never vacation in the summer time to any of the destinations I have chosen.

      Ciao, buon giorno! Venice es molto bene! I am in an Internet cafe. Never been to one before and didn't expect to but figured what the hell? I'm staying at the Hotel Castello, it overlooks St. Mark's Square and the canal grande. Visited shops in St. Mark's Square, Basilica San Giorgio Maggiore and took a gondola ride on the canal today. My limited Italian isn't a problem here because many shop owners and locals speak a fair amount of English. A presto, arrivedrci!

      I'm trying to pack but can't concentrate. I want to take my vacation to Sacramento, instead. My flight leaves in 4 hours. First stop is Venice, Italy. Can't believe I have the guts to go on this vacation. Memories of last week make me want to stay. I should have gone to UC Davis but think going to Yale was for the best. I can't stop thinking about how things would work out if I did decide to go the Davis route.

      As part of my best man duties, I was asked to read the following during the ceremony:    How do you know when you love someone?    "Then said Almitra, "Speak to us of Love."   And he raised his head and looked upon the people, and there fell a stillness upon them. And with a great voice he said: When love beckons to you follow him, though his ways are hard and steep. And when his wings enfold you yield to him, though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. And when he speaks to you believe in him, though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.   For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning. Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, so shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth. Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself. He threshes you to make you naked. He sifts you to free you from your husks. He grinds you to whiteness. He kneads you until you are pliant; And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast.   All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life's heart. But if in your fear you would seek only love's peace and love's pleasure, then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love's threshing-floor, into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears.   Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself. Love possesses not nor would it be possessed; For love is sufficient unto love. When you love you should not say, "God is in my heart," but rather, I am in the heart of God." And think not you can direct the course of love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course. Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself. But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires:   To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.  To know the pain of too much tenderness.  To be wounded by your own understanding of love;  And to bleed willingly and joyfully.  To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;  To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy;  To return home at eventide with gratitude;  And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips."   quoted from Kahlil Gibran's "The Prophet"

      I'm here in jolly ol England. I'm in London, to be exact. Cody, Ashlynn, their "mates" and I just returned home from a night out. It's now 7:58 AM. We hit up a club called Cargo and a few bars along the way (Bedroom bar, Cafe Kick and Medicine).   I am the only one in the wedding party from the states to arrive. The AEP frat bros are set to be here in 2 days. Party? Fuck yeah. I fucking love England. Went with the happy couple to the Claverley Hotel, where the reception will be held. When I inquired about the cost of this soiree, Cody gave me a nod and said, "4x more then your Yale education for the next 2 years." Parents are paying so why not think big? Dinner at the reception is $60 a head with over 500 people in attendance.   They are taking me sight seeing today, after we sleep a few winks. I've been here before but that was years ago. The bachelor party is pegged for July 12. Cody's future brother-in-law, Ari, has the whole shindig planned. I have my tux fitting tomorrow, afterwards we will be once again hitting the circuit.   My time in California was spent with April. I took her out to dinner twice. It seems that we do not share the same affection for foreign fare. The idea of there being an "us" has been exhausted. It's best to have her as a friend then nothing at all. She is amazing, even if she hates French, Indian and Jewish food. The woman is a diamond in the rough.    Since when did I indulge in cliches and popular sayings? I'll blame the alkie. Got to  get some shut eye so we can party it up tonight.

      I will be working at Yale New Haven Hospital part time. I start this Friday. I'm trying to unpack but there is limited space. My new place is a small 1 bedroom with living room and patio. It feels like the dorms. My old place was a 3 bedroom with family room, living room, huge kitchen, loft and backyard). I'm on a month to month lease so if I find a larger place.  Living here will be a dramatic change for me. I miss the fast pace of NY already (my old place was 4 blocks from Central Park). My old high school football buddy, Jose, is also attending Yale and lives a block away. He offered to show me around town.  I have a new girlfriend (my best friend), Erin Caberra-Wong. She is 28, still lives in NY, and is a substitute teacher. We hooked up after returning from England. Cody's wedding was insane. Ash's parents shelled out 40k and his parents chipped in 30k. Everything was overdone and elaborate. I brought a copy of the video for my family to see and now my mother is already planning  my  wedding and my little bro's wedding (he's 16).  After school starts, I'll be MIA so get your Derick fix while you still can.
