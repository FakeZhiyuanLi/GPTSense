      I smell the breath on my dad, he's been yelling. Why how silly of me its the O L Y M P R I C K S  Its that time again where the dicks of sporting worlds come together in there loser sports, to aparently celebrate Humanity Celebration is party right? How can the olympics be a celebration of humnaity if im not invited? i wonder if its like Kinky or Bar Stardo? How can it be every 4 years for 2 weeks, i think that celebration is a bit short, well for a world where  its estimated 5 people are killed every hour, dont you think the celebration should be longer or extend to more types of people, like me? How can people, like my dad, cheer fags,cry babys and oddball champions in there weiny sports, would they cheer me if i represented Australia in something i do well? Hmmmm Masterbating? I saw today an article, which turns this post from celebration to celebrities, that said Willie Mason was a bigger celebrity then John Farnham? How can someone who couldnt keep his pants on at Coffs Harbour be more famous then a multi platinum music artsit? Back to sport,  you hear alot of words been used in sportspeople this days. The public is been told how they dont reach there peak performance. I think that if these people got off there bums, stopped acting like hobo's and get a real job like some parents, then they would reach there maximum mental cababilities. It just bugs me how my mum can make less money in nursing over 4 years then a suposed AFL master player does in 6 weeks. FUCKIN DISGRACE

      Last night as i was coming home from the library, which the upstairs coversation should be posted on Keisha's blog not mine, I received a sms followed by a phone call from my good friend who invited me to her house for dinner, plus she was cooking. At first i wanted to go because Sarah is a good friend, but even more because she was cooking. So i called my dad and got the okay and i needed some mean chow because i had a packed day full of eggs,denials,accusations,dead birds,subway,randles past and Keishas other self. So i got to her house and i could already smell the goodies coming from the kitchen, while she cooked i talked about music stuff. I was been fed Pasta, now you all know how i hate mushrooms, even the magic ones, yet there were mushrooms in this dish, so as to upset her and i was too hungry to care anyway. So every now and then i added a comment on how bad it was, she laughed but you never know, maybe deep down inside she was crying?? Nah my final werdict was a 8.5/10 , The sauce was so hardcore strong like only mum knows how to cook, so i liked it. It was a good evening and as alot of my friends know that my new phone entertains, so it did. While i ended up talking with Sarah's Mum,Her friend and Sarah's Aunty, Plus add me singing a few disco favourites likr YMCA, I come from a land downunder and All that she wants. Ohh what a proveful night. Plus Sarah's Mum drove me home listening to ELO, so i must say what a night i had. I must say that i recommend anyone eating Sarah's grub cause its first class, and for those who want to see me and my karoke skills, You'll get your chance

      I just watched pet semetary on Foxtel last night, and i thought to myself how much i could relate to that movie with my life. Anyone who hasnt seen it, Its the stroy of a family who move to a house on the highway with only one neighbour nearby. They learn on there property is a pet sematary and its "where the dead speak". Well the father of the family finds, with some help from the neighbour an old ancient indian power circle, which if the dead are buried on it are brought back. The father tries it with the cat and it comes back back only different. When the fathers youngest child is hit by a truck (The truckie is listening to my favourite Ramones Song!), the father ponders on buring the child in the power circle. The neighbour advises against it saying that the child will be brought back by Satan himself. The father thinks the child wont be like that. The chlild comes back, kills the neighbour and the mother. Before the dad has to struggle to put him down. The stroy then finishes with a weird twist. Add a helping ghost and the childs elder sister who has accurate dreams of whats happening, and you have Pet Semetary. So you ask how does that to do with jesse? Well i see myself as the child. For my life i been seen as lower to everyone else and been looked down upon. That truck was a wake up call to me saying i should stand up for myself and do stuff different. I decided that i dont want to take shit from people anymore. So i kill them? It may work! But sooner or later im gonna get put down and i will go back to the little person people reckon i should be  Oh Well, Later and Enjoi
