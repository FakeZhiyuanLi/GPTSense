       Saturday  features a  PIG ROAST ! We haven't met the animal yet, but we know the farmer, and we're sure it's delicious! We'll have the ingredients for salads and sides, we'll just need some hands to help prepare them.  For those of you staying with us, breakfast is usually heavy (the kids call it BIG BREAKFAST) with a light lunch to sail us in to the pig roast.   Sunday  we'll be chowing down on some locally-raised veal steaks. (There's no room for vegatarians here). Again, help in the preparation of sides and salads is much appreciated. And yes, David did meet the doe-eyed little bugger, and he  is  delicious.  Breakfast and lunch, as noted above.   Monday  we'll be having steak and pork sandwiches (read leftovers...), plus sausages, wings, and the like.  We envisage nachos, chips, and other such health food making an appearance throughout the weekend.   Friday we'll be playing by ear till we hear when everyone will be getting in!   If you don't eat meat then I doubt you're a White, but you can let us know by posting a comment below.

      Is there anything anyone would like to do other than sit around drinking beer (and re-wiring Dave's basement)?  We have the standard cards, games, horse shoe pit, firepit (anyone who remember's David's youth will know that we naturally have one of these), badminton net, and the like. Yvonne and Bill have a pool.  Jo-Anne and other parents are planning on going to the Toronto Zoo on Monday with the kids and anyone else who would like to go is more than welcome to do so. It's a 2 1/2 hour drive from London and it's around $18 adult to get in.    As you can see from the comments below, we're still planning on going. The waterpark is actually  in  the zoo and doesn't cost any extra. Sorry for the confusion.   Also - Michael - Yvonne said no golf on the long weekend or there's hell to pay. You'll have to catch Gary, Bill, and David earlier.   Can anyone think of anything else they'd like to do? Drop a line in the comments section below.

      Please bring all the pictures you have of the White family (or friends, or your dog) with you when you come.  We'll have a scanner on hand and will be able to scan the pictures and email them out to anyone who wants them. Emabarrassing photos are especially welcome (and most especially if they are of Bill).

      This is a rather important line item that was overlooked earlier. We've pegged the price at  $75 per adult  (kids stay free, just like at Comfort Inn). This should cover everything.  If you don't think you can afford it, just let us know and we'll figure it out. You can email me at library_girl1 AT hotmail DOT com (this is just so I don't get on a spam list, obviously replace the AT with @ and the DOT with .) or call me at 519.245.6364.  If you want to send us a cheque (posted dated or otherwise) in advance, you can mail it to: 67 Willow Cres. Strathroy ON N7G 4H1  Otherwise, you can get us at the reunion. Cheers.
