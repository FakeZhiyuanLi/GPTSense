      Well, its that time of life when your done with highschool, the prom is coming and your supposed to be partying all the time (particularly at the prom).  Well not for me. My highschool 'experience' has been a true pain in the ass, from the beginning to the end. I'm happy alright, but not prom happy, I don't feel like wasting another day of my life with those post pubertal sex mongers, who act like absolute ignoramuses on a daily basis, and that, for once in their lives will be dressed up classy; ditching the usual "in" clothes.   Highschool has been an all around learning experience, sure. Just not the theory in the books (which I found terribly dull; the content was illustrated and verbalized in a way that a 6 year old could understand). I developed multiple skills, such as the ability to judge who is a literal  asshole , the guts to tell people to go fuck themselves (after a lot of getting teased, and getting my ass fed up with it), the capability of not getting emotionally attached to a girl that cant make the difference between a friend and vaginal intercourse (which I never got the chance to do so far, heck I stayed away from it), and a variety of other skills required not to end up intakeing comparable amounts of air and alcohol.  I really don't get what it is with everyone, I've always felt, in a non demeaning way, that a lot of people which surround me (not necessarily friends) are of.. Questionable intellect, or perhaps, use of it.  oThis is what's real wired about ur wonderful school system! Remember say, grade 4? There's always that (those) kid(s) who are into the spelling bee contest, read a lot of books and have good grades in math. I look at those faces today (being in 12th grade), and a lot, if not most of them have faded away in the sense that they just aren't mister (miss?) smartass anymore. Alot of them are into the wonderful brain-draining sport of football, or hockey (which is just as dumbifing, if you allow the word)... and the girls are into the art of getting fucked by evrey guy in the school (apart from me, of course; i dont stand a chance in this universe of fried neurons)... For fucks sake! The guy who was mister spelling is bee back then now mister I need attention; pursuing an acting career, even though he has absolutely no talent  whatsoever  in that domain! If your wondering, i'm not on an ego offensive, those people just made my life miserable back then, thanks to teasing and rejection.  I take a look at good ol' me... And well... Surprise (if your me, otherwise you just don't notice)!  Back in elementary school, I was your average pain in the ass. I was always first in line to say I didn't do my homework. I didn't participate in school life (which I still believe is a great excuse for attention craving kids) and I didn't have kind words for everyone (I still don't). I wasn't in drugs or in crime though, nor am i today.  And, well, i look at myself now and I got my 436 math (advanced 11th grade mathematics), I'm going to do my 536 math (advanced 12th grade math, which I didn't get to do this year, because I'm a year behind in French, thanks to getting bullied) and I'm planning a college/university education in the physics domain. (oh yea and plus all the lil bullies are either in drugs, dead or depressed :)  Now, the point of this story isn'st self-glorification (although it does work out well for the author), it's to point out the fact that school, and the grades you get at school (during elementary and highschool.. Minus 12th grade) aren't worth  jack shit  at telling you how smart you are; they're nothing more then an ongoing popularity contest, in which you choose to participate for bragging rights.   So, I'm all happy; I don't know if I'll be able to withhold myself from posting about high school related issues in the following [last] 3 weeks of it, but I'll try my darn best.

      Finished my final exam this morning, math... or at least that's what the sheet said. Without starting a 10 page rant, let's just say it wasnt very difficult... then again it was math 514 so i guess its okay. We got the yearbook and, as per usual with 12th graders it was a frenzy to get people to sign your yearbook (i only asked one person to sign),so that in 10 years, when your flippin burgers at "fatso's sloppy fries," you can remember you were popular and enjoyed teasing people like me who are now your boss, at least for the 2 and a half minutes when i'm waiting for you and your lazy ass to get me that bigmac.  Anyway, it's time for me to take a well deserved rest (dont know what i really did this year at school but im tired anyway), and then, in 2 months, we get to go to adults school for a year and finish  IMPORTANT  courses, to allow me to moove on in life as i forsee.  Ill probably post a few times this summer when i'll be bored shitless, and i'm promising myself that next year im gonna excell in whatever endeavours i take on.
