Music, Inc (BMI)    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   Friendship is a funny thing.  Throughout my life I've made a lot of friends. I make friends (friendly acquaintances?) easily, despite my deficiencies/lack of interest in making small talk.  Friends that I have kept in touch with over the years, where our relationship has continued to grow, I can count on my fingers.    Now, the reason for this, I haven't quite figured out.  Part of it is ultimately the fact that I am, at heart, a loner. I like my solitude, I don't seek out companionship on a regular basis.  And, possibly because of that, companionship doesn't come looking for me.  Partially, it's because I'm lazy I suppose.  I really only work at friendships where I really feel a connection.  Those individual friendships all seem to fill and nurture different niches in my psyche.  One of the people in that select group recently made a crack about my having a people addiction.  If I do (and i'm not really denying it), it's only to and for certain people.  Although it has surfaced lately, there are specific reasons (or maybe justifications) why.  It usually appears when I develop a crush on someone, or I'm feeling a need to help.    For example, most recently my friend Kyle was(possibly unfortunately) the unwitting recipient of that focus.  Mostly because he was going through a really rough time, he had confided in me, and I felt like I could help him.  Also, because I had other friends who I wanted to help, but couldn't for whatever reason.  So I focused all that pent up energy and emotion in doing whatever I could for Kyle, whether asked or not.  And ultimately, while I think he was not ungrateful, I possibly overdid it and made him uncomfortable.  sigh. ::shakes self out of nostalgic regret::  Anyway. I think another reason for my habit of keeping people at arms length most of the time is that throughout my life, I have always felt that (whether justified or not) whatever affection, kinship, or friendship I  do  feel for people is not equally returned, that I am tolerated, and looked kindly upon, but the depth of emotion is not reciprocated.  I live in constant fear of finding out that I AM only being tolerated.  That I'm not being included in things on purpose, that the relationship I thought was mutual is really only one sided.   Anyway, as I grow older, I  know  that it's not true.  The problem is imposing the knowledge on the feelings.  I always am surprised when people seek me out, and more and more it's the people I WANT to seek me out that do.  Which surprises me even more.  Maybe it does all boil down to a self-esteem issue.  That somewhere inside I don't feel worthy of the love, that I'm the lesser half of those chosen friendships.  But ultimately, I think one of my tasks this time around is to kick that feeling, and to move away from any people addiction. Right now though, it feels like I'm floundering.  Problem is,  I  need to throw myself the rope, but I haven't figured out how.

      It's really hard to completely seperate yourself from a situation when:  A: You keep being reminded of the players, even though you try to remove yourself.  B: You see truths way more clearly than player B.   C: You understand a facet of player A that player B doesn't even realize is there.     It's a messy game. One I never should have started playing in the first place.  And once I realized I was using the wrong rulebook, I should have pulled out and STAYED out.  But ultimately it's one that keeps sucking me back in.  And how do you keep away when you refuse to lose that which brought you together in the first place.   Triangles have points.  Points are sharp.  Sharp things cut. Cuts leave scars.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   I just want someone to be as eager to see me as I am to see them.  Who doesn't want to let go of my hand, even when I'm the one who took theirs.  Who reaches out to me for no reason, out of the blue ~ just because they were thinking of me.  Who loves me regardless.  Who I can make eye contact with across the room, and know we're thinking the same thing.  That I can sit in silence with, doing nothing, and not feel uncomfortable. Who accepts the fact that I can be needy sometimes, and will let me be without judging me.  Who makes me  sure  of the fact that they love me as much as I love them. That the feelings are equal. That I'm not alone.    Don't get me wrong, I am FINE with solitude, I enjoy my own company.  I have to get away from everyone on a regular basis.  I just am ready for someone who wants to join me in my solitude from time to time.  I don't mind being an observer, being the center of the vortex.    But just for once I'd like to feel truly connected.    I know my challenges are those I've set myself for this life, and that all I need to rely on is me.  But I'd like some company for awhile...

      Posts from the past year that might interest you. Some were written only for me to read, so they're a little choppy & shorthand.  All of them are under friend's filters on my Live Journal.  Nov.2  Went to the Renaissance Festival, had a palm & tarot reading ~ really good.   Started with the palm reading, he was taken aback by my palms... extremely gifted with intuition, pay attention to my dreams, I'm being given information. Open up to my intuition, let it work, don't be afraid... The obstacles in my life are ones I've put there as challenges. I must overcome them in order to move on. I should give myself more credit for intelligence & intuition. Don't be afraid of my talents. I am here to serve, by being a conduit for information for people. I will know who I have information for. Start writing down the strange dreams, the dreams and voices are trying to tell me something. Strong addiction line. Be aware and don't let it cross lifeline. One of the problems I'm trying to overcome is a people addiction. I must learn to be comfortable being alone with myself, rather than craving company... Once I take care of myself, I will be able to fully care for others without sacrificing either. I am extremely passionate, and my life/career would best be served by indulging them. (It seemed like he thought he was telling me my career should involve indulging sexual passions) The way I am meant to serve is by allowing my intuitive/conduit abilities to thrive and using them to help others learn what the universe is trying to tell them. He asked if I thought I would ever cheat on someone, I said no. I should have asked if that includes being with someone who is cheating on their partner.   Nov. 24    What I was feeling at the time about a certain person:  I think: You're a Jackass. You like Trouble. You like Drama. You like CREATING Drama You like being the center of attention. You were always interested in her, regardless of what you told me. You played us against each other to make her jealous. You like to be the Good Guy, so you turn tail when things you start begin to get messy. It was getting rough to have both of us in your life, and since you're fucking her you got rid of me by making me look like I was a nutcase, and playing on her sympathies. You don't give a shit what LIES you tell, as long as you look good. You want friendship to be on YOUR terms. You two DESERVE each other. I'm too good for that shit. If I never hear from you again, it'll be too soon. As much as I want to HATE you... I can't sustain it for long.   Excerpt from  Nov. 24 : Why is it that I decide that I really want to be friends with someone, and then overdo it?? I think I really DO have a people addiction. Though in my case it has nothing to do with being in constant company, and everything to do with whose company I'm in.   urlLink GO READ THIS   and then this is what happened after: ::FOR THOSE WHO HAVE MET HER, DO NOT EVER SPEAK OF THIS IF YOU SEE HER::  Amy had been drinking vodka since we started wandering. We hadn't really eaten since lunch, and once we got to the venue, she pretty much settled in to a steady rythym. Sarah & I got something to eat, but Amy didn't. Now she can handle her alcohol, but by the time the show started, she was pretty drunk. So Sarah decided she was going to try and get her back to the hotel. The streetcars (which were supposed to be running regularly) never seemed to show up, so Sarah brought her back to the bar,   She decided we were trying to hold her against her will, kept trying to get people to help her get away. (One of the worst moments was when she saw Carrie outside talking on the phone. amy knew who she was because I had pointed her out earlier. Amy headed straight for her and started talking to her, in a way I interpreted as threatening towards Carrie. So I pulled Amy back and mouthed "I'm Sorry" to Carrie. That part has since come back to haunt me. A lot.) She calmed down a little bit, and then when we'd relaxed our guard, ran away.  She ran away from us about 3 times, all 3 of us have bruises and scratches (at one point she was lying on the hood of the cab ASKING me to hit her) we had to try to physically subdue her to even start getting her into the cab. (Thank God for the cabdriver. He was AWESOME ~ he helped calm her down tremendously )   Then when we got her back to the hotel, she was calmed down (it seemed) got a shower (she was extremely muddy) then she proceeded to get dressed again, and started getting hostile towards us. It ended up with her running out of the room, banging on hotel doors to get someone to help her get away from us. We finally called security because she wasn't listening to us.   Long story a little shorter, the police got called, she was told her options (go back to the room and go to sleep, be taken to Charity Hospital, or to jail if she didn't calm down) She opted to walk out of the hotel, and run down St Charles to get away from us. We didn't see or hear from her again. We finally heard from a mutual friend who she called. He called us because her story wasn't making any sense. But he told us that she went to the bus station and was becoming more rational.  Everything's okay, she ended up catching a Greyhound home. And she's since called to apologize profusely, but she doesn't remember anything between the bar and the hotel. She only remembers what happened in the hotel. I was just glad to hear the Amy I know back again. I didn't know that person in the hotel room.  But last night renewed my faith in people. From the bartenders at Carrollton Station who made sure we finally got a cab (after the first one they called got swiped from us) to the cabdriver who made sure we got her safe back to the hotel (even though he would have been totally within his rights to refuse) to the night manager, valet and security officer of the hotel. And we even ran into the night manager in the Quarter this morning! He recognized us, and asked about our friend.  We'll probably never know for sure what happened in her head, whether it was just the alcohol or if someone slipped her something, or what. But I'll be grateful if I never have to deal with anything like that again. (update: I've mostly forgiven Amy for that night. She wasn't herself, but I still can't completely forgive her for it. And on some levels, i hate that. But not completely)  Anyway, I have Sarah to thank for my being able to see 97% of the show. I didn't realize how bad Amy was until after. I really only missed the new version of "Ballad". The other 2 things I had to miss were things I'd seen performed before   Okay, the next parts I went ahead & unlocked, partially because they're long, and partially because they make me ill just looking at them. This is the message I sent Adam telling him that Carrie had his passwords.  urlLink THIS  is the reply, and  urlLink THIS  was my response.   Next Episodes:   urlLink A                   urlLink B                   urlLink C  And  urlLink THIS  explains how much I'm afraid the whole mess overflowed into my life.  Anyway. I'm giving you access to all this because, 1 ~ it's really influencing my outlook right now, and 2 ~ it's tiring/depressing enough just posting it here, let alone having to retell it all over the phone.     Which should pretty well bring you up to date on THAT saga.  ::SIGH::

      Just after I posted the "Thanks for the CD" post, I got a reply from Adam, which turned into a 10+ email exchange/conversation.   Mostly about the songs on the CD, but also a little about things in general.  Ultimately it ended with my feeling like, yes, I got fucked over, but I don't think Adam ever meant it to happen that way.  I ended up trusting too much too fast, and he withheld information, which made me make decisions that I wouldn't have made if I'd known the whole story.  It got to the point where I think both of us felt like we had to protect ourselves from Carrie's wrath.  Unfortunately, it was at the expense of the other.   Carrie felt like she had to fight for "her man".  The problem was, I didn't know he was hers until it was too late.  Because I trusted what he was telling me.  So I protected his secrets for too long, he didn't protect mine, and it backfired on me.  Big time.     I don't think he became friends with me just (if at all) to get Carrie.  I think he had his eye on her before we became acquainted, and when his opening came, went for it. Working both sides until he was sure.  Unfortunately, I was there, an often unwitting, player in the game.  Thing is, I thought we were playing a different game.  Anyway, he's made his choice, now he has to live with it.  And as he told me on Thursday night, it's rough going.  (partially because he's 37 with entanglements, she's a divorced, jealous, demanding 24 and 700 miles away)   Unfortunately, his choice got in the way of a growing friendship/relationship/whatever it was.  He asked me to keep in touch, and in his way, apologized.   Anyway. I feel like there's still a mutual affection/friendship there.  Regardless of how much trouble I got him into by coming clean (mostly) with Carrie, and how much he hurt my feelings and betrayed my trust.  We both care what happens to/about the other.  I let my walls down too far, too fast and got burned.  I trust too easily, and I'm way too idealistic (maybe even too naive) to enter into a mind game like that and win.  But that's okay, because I don't want to be the kind of person that it takes to win that game.  And because of this, I'm a little wiser, and the walls are thicker and higher.  I hope he finds happiness and success, because he does deserve it.     (is it wrong to hope that he doesn't find it with her?)

      So I get home after stopping by rehearsal for Pirates of Penzance at the  urlLink Country Playhouse , (my friend Chris is directing ~ he's also Artistic Director) and waiting for me is a padded CD envelope.   At first I think it's the new  urlLink Cowboy Mouth  CD I ordered, then I realize, no. It's MY handwriting...  It's a SASE I sent Adam about 8 months ago that I'd given up on it ever being returned.  It's got his band's new CD in it. That's all. Just the CD.  No note, liner notes, nothing.  The only indication he'd even dealt with it was the return address in his handwriting.  So I vacillated on whether to even acknowledge I got it, but decided not to would just be RUDE, and I try to never be that. (my momma tried to raise me right anyway...)  So I emailed him.  Contents of E-mail:   It arrived today.  I'm listening to it now.   Thank you.    I'm sorry that the friendship that we'd started broke down and got messy.  You were a fun part of my life when there didn't seem to be a lot of fun around.  I just couldn't take all the blame anymore.  Yeah, I made some bad choices, but they seemed right at the time.   Whatever you may think, I do still care what happens to you. You're a talented guy. You deserve great things and great happiness.  I will (do) miss our friendship.   Take care of yourself and those you care for.  Everything else will follow .    I doubt I'll hear back, I hope HE'S the one to read it, but it could be interpreted as a final "it was fun while it lasted, see ya..." letter.    What a fucking emotional rollercoaster I've been on this week.
