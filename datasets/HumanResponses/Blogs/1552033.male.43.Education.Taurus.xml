      Oh my...  I turn my head for a moment and everything changes.  I must admit, the new layout is very impressive and it looks easy to learn.  I like it!  I have spent the past three months teaching English up in Fukushima Prefecture.  For those of you who are unfamiliar with Japan, Fukushima is a few hundred kilometers north of Tokyo.  In Fukushima I have been living and working in a small town called Nihonmatsu.  Although I have studied quite a bit of Japanese history, this is my first trip to Northern Japan.  Nihonmatsu sits astride one of the widest passes through the Northern alps of Japan.  If you are sending an army north, you must pass through Nihonmatsu.  As a result, this small village in the foothills, home to rice farmers and apple growers, has played a pivotal role in many major conflicts.  In the mid-1700s the Japanese Imperial family wrested control from the warrior class that had controlled Japan for two and half centuries.  The conflict that broke the warrior's power base and allowed this to happen is referred to as the "Bosshin War".   As far as Japanese civil wars usually go, it wasn't really much of a conflict.  The Imperial Forces were armed with new rifles and modern cannon while the samurai had learned to depend almost entirely on their swords.  Even lances were no longer a major part of the warrior's arsenal, although everyone still practiced with them.  The better armed, more highly organized Imperial Forces stormed north through Nihonmatsu on their way to Sendai, the holdout of one of Northern Japan's most powerful samurai families.  The Niwa clan, overseers of Nihonmatsu, sent the bulk of their retainers north to help defend their lords in Sendai.  The key to the Northern strategy was a delaying action in Nihonmatsu, Adachi, and several dozen other small towns between the Kanto plain and Sendai.  Between equally equipped and trained forces it would have played out as a classic war of attrition that the wealthier northern forces would have easily won.  Things were not equal and the first major battle at Nihonmatsu showed just how true that was.  The Imperial forces met the Niwa clan's remaining forces at the southern end of the valley.  A ragtag force of teenagers, young men, and retired bureaucrats stood firm against a force that outnumbered them around a hundred to one.  The resulting battle was a complete slaughter that lasted less than a day.  Every battle between Nihonmatsu and Sendai went the same.  A delaying action that the northern daimyo had hoped would buy them six months to build up their forces lasted barely a few weeks.  Half their retainers surrendered, most of the remaining forces faded into the landscape without a fight.  All over in Nihonmatsu are plaques, stone stelles, and other monuments commemorating the battle, its victims, and the history that led up to it.  Living and working in Nihonmatsu has been quite an adventure.

      Ah-ha!  It suddenly seems the system is cooperating with me.  Today's thought:   My favorite subject is me!  It is interesting that the human animal is hopelessly self-centered.  The surest way to win friends and influence people is to ask them questions which allow them to ramble on endlessly about themselves, their opinions, their beliefs, their wisdom, their hobbies, and so on.  Blogging takes this thinking to the next level by creating a media which allows each of us to pour our hearts and minds onto those hapless lives foolish or unlucky enough to wander across these pages and find themselves drowning in our own self-worship.  Something tells me I'm going to love blogging.  ;-)

      Hmm.  This blogger stuff is more difficult than I imagined.  I thought I had already opened a new blog, but apparently my miserable first attempt failed.  Before I continue, I should perhaps test this one.

      It starts like this, I suppose.  A blank page waiting to be filled with mild musings, wild flights of fancy, and everything in between.  I have a website, http://www.greyhawkmanor.org, but by the time I get around to updating anything I have forgotten HTML and must relearn everything from scratch.  At one point I kept an online portfolio at Writing.com, but endless hassles with the parnoid hacker who runs the joint resulted in two portfolios being deleted, the first by me, the second by him.  It wouldn't be so bad except in the end the loss of both portfolios resulted in his confiscating over $400 of my hard-earned cash.  Criminal complaints have so far gone unnoticed.  I guess the FBI is too busy looking for Osama BinLaden.  I don't know if this blog (goodness me, is that an appropriate acronym or what?) will ever amount to anything, but I'll run with it for a little while and see how it goes.  Cheers to anyone who wastes a minute reading this!

      In many ways, wisdom starts by learning to see the world through different eyes.  Understanding the perspective of people in opposition to you allows you to appreciate the tensions and stresses they are under, which in turn can lead you toward the best compromise for both of you.  The one thing they don't teach us in kindergarten is that most of life is a process of negotiation.  Each person you encounter will have their own agendas, their own priorities, and their own values.  More often than not, their ideas and yours will be in direct opposition.  But of course, you already knew that!  Perspective.  There are many ways to develop a wider perspective.  Reading books about a wide range of topics is an easy way to start, assuming of course, you want to be wise.  Another way is to open your mind and seriously consider the viewpoints of people you hate, despise, or adamantly disagree with.  Chances are, if you take them seriously for a moment, you'll find you have more in common than you ever imagined.  Then there is the anthropological approach.  Spend some time learning about the attitudes and experiences of people with lives you cannot imagine living.  A good place to start might be  urlLink Last Day of My Life , the blog of a homeless man.  Sincere, sometimes angry, mostly cynical, and always focused on survival, his view of life is terrifyingly realistic.  His world and your world might seem like completely different planets, but in truth, his world is your world.  Closing your eyes to his struggle will not make your world a better place to live, it will only make it more shallow.

      I often wonder if there is some deeper reality behind the one we face every day of our lives.   urlLink Religious Tolerance  hosts hundreds of files containing religious and spiritual works from a dizzying array of cultural backgrounds.  Every major religion proclaims that behind the world we see is a hidden world that can only be realized through faith, dreams, visions, and hallucinations.  Thousands, maybe millions of people have had non-physical encounters with this alternate reality.  They in turn tell their stories in fiction, poetry, spiritual tracts, or on the couches of counsellors and psychologists as they struggle to draw some connection between this invisible world and the one around them.  I envy those who have the capacity to clearly distinguish between reality and unreality.  Many of us cannot.  The  urlLink X-files  enjoyed huge popularity by connecting this spiritual reality with aliens.  One of my favorite online comics,  urlLink Eversummer Eve , links the invisible world with the legendary land of the elves.  Psychologists tell us there is no invisible world.  For mental health professionals things such as aliens, elves, magic, or even god, are forms of  urlLink shared delusions .  There is one aspect to faith in the invisible that rapidly becomes annoying: intolerance.  Once upon a time we were children and our parents frequently reminded us that without differences, the world would be a very boring place.  Sometimes they would smile cryptically and also mention that variety is the spice of life.  Nonetheless, looking into the world around me reveals that individualism has become such a catch phrase that every individual believes they alone understand the "truth".  Fundamental Christians bomb abortion clinics, fundamental Hindus bomb historic mosques, fundamental Muslims bomb discos.  Why are so many people so intent are forcing the rest of us to accept their vision of reality?  Or, perhaps, the real question is somewhat different.   Perhaps the real question is why are we so deaf that the only way they can be heard is to blow something up?

      Over the past 48 hours or so I have discovered that I have the most boring blog in cyberspace.  I wonder if I should change the title?  The only way to improve things would be to learn enough DHTML to deeply and thoroughly rewrite the template that controls how this page is layed out.  Sadly, I am too old, too stubborn, and too stupid to simply buy a $50 book, read it, and become a DHTML master.  I know this for a fact because over the past few years I have bought a dozen such books and I still can't remember which tags are "open" and which are "closed", let alone remember more than a handful of the tags themselves.  My own website,  urlLink Greyhawk Manor , represents the "height" of my HTML mastery and it's so simple a modern elementary school student could do the same in a single afternoon.  It took me a year of study and six months of coding.  Old age sucks.  Don't misunderstand me!  I have no desire to stay young.  None.  Zero. Zip. Zilch.  Not even a hint.  I look forward to growing old, getting gray hair, developing wrinkles, and of course, becoming hopelessly stubborn and obstinate.  My hope is that "crotchety" will be the kindest thing people say about me.  I  love  growing old!  But it still sucks.

      I have seen Hulk.  It was an incredible comic, and now it has become an incredible movie.  Naturally, the critics lambasted it mercilessly.  One critic proclaimed it the worst summer movie since Jaws created the idea of "summer blockbuster".  As usual, the critics missed the point.  Hulk has a complex, multilayered storyline featuring classic conflicts, romance, and keen human insight.  It tells a story of greed, ambition, idealism, and realism all in conflict with one another.  As mentioned everywhere, the story opens with a genetic researcher desperately trying to perfect regeneration in humans and rapidly running out of funding.  He makes the same mistake of every fictional researcher (and many real ones), he experiments on himself.  In this case, there is an unexpected side effect, the results of his research are genetically passed on to his son.  There is a moment of confusion, and next we see the grown son become researcher working on nanomeds designed to act as regeneration agents.  In a lab accident his genetically modified body absorbs the nanomeds he is developing and he is exposed to a massive amount of gamma rays.  The net result is the transformation into a big green man rampaging through the countryside, but not immediately.  He still appears himself, but when angered swells up and develops superhuman physical abilities.  If the entire concept of the movie ended right there, then the critics would be right.  Hulk would be another worthless Hollywood extravaganza.  Fortunately, it doesn't.  Sub-plots involving a former girlfriend, a money-hungry capital venturist, and the return of the Hulk's half-crazy father whirl around each other in a maelstrom of tension and intrigue that would do a winter thriller justice.  Bruce, the son of the original researcher, struggles to find his past, reconcile himself with his present, and learn to understand himself better as a human being.  In the end, a titanic struggle between god-like father and son is brought to an explosive conclusion when the two are hit with a nuclear weapon of some kind.  The father disappears, the son survives but vanishes.  Later, the son surfaces dispensing medications in an unnamed Latin American jungle where there is a hint that he is using his brawny green side to defend the people from revolutionaries.  We're left with him ominously warning a revolutionary leader, "you won't like me when I'm angry."  Throughout the movie ran themes of repressed memory, the definition of humanity, morality, survival, and of course, what it means to be a hero.  Critics didn't like Hulk because underneath the usual flash and bang was something they couldn't recognize,  literature!

      I saw Chicago last month.  It stank.  I've got better things to do with my time than sit around and let Hollywood laugh at my unswerving loyalty to the silver screen.  Besides, the lead actresses were far too skinny for my taste.  I also saw Matrix Reloaded.  It was better than Chicago, but I'll never develop homoerotic fantasies for Keanu Reeves, and the chick that played Trinity has gotten even skinnier than she was in the first one!  Will Hollywood ever rediscover "pleasantly plump"?  Good grief but I hope so!  On the other hand, Angelina Jolie is back for another whirl as Lara Croft.  Now there's a woman I could happily spend two hours watching strut her stuff.  Her acting skill and dynamic characterizations are a pleasant bonus.  Oh, that reminds me, I also saw Charlie's Angels Full Throttle.  When did Demi lose all that weight?  If she gets any skinnier she'll have to go back to playing roles intended for teenagers!  Anyway, sad to say, the best movie I have seen in the past year or so was the Japanese movie, "Azumi".  It's a live-action free-for-all based on a popular comic with a drop-dead gorgeous lead actress, entertaining and engaging support characters, and get this, a real storyline!  My oh my!  A movie with a story!  Imagine that!  Maybe one of these days Hollywood will take a page out of Casablanca go back to telling us a good story.  All that flash and dazzle is nice, but a movie needs a story to tie it all together.  I've heard rumors "Pirates of the Carribbean" actually has a storyline.  I am waiting with bated breath.

      I suppose, somewhere, somehow, there is rhyme and reason to the chaos that surrounds us.  After all, chaos is only undefined as long as there are too many variables to accurately predict the outcome.  Once the variables are defined, it is no longer chaos.  Instead, it is merely complexity.  For example, I logged on today to find a box for adding titles.  The chaotic aspect is that I had no intention of logging on today, because it feels like I have nothing interesting to say.  When I grew bored of cruising the chaos of cyberspace, I dropped in here anyway.  Clear chaos.  Was the title bar there earlier and I just didn't see it, or is it in truth, something new?  Oh well, as long as I'm here I suppose I should post something wise, witty, or poetic, but alas, as noted above, I have nothing to say today.  Nothing important anyway.  How about a story?  Shall I tell you a story?  Once upon a time there was a wise old Brahmin living somewhere in the Ganghes River Valley.  This old man owned nothing except for one priceless porcelein vase given to him by a long-forgotten king in exchange for a year spent advising him on ways to spread happiness through his kingdom.  Despite being a Brahmin and basically unattached to material things, the old man was quite fond of the memories the vase brought to mind and he carried it with him for many, many years.  As always, eventually the king died and was replaced by someone less wise, less kind, and far more ruthless.  Thus the old Brahmin had come to live in a tiny one-room shack just above the flood plain.  In the village near where the old Brahmin lived there was a certain thief who heard about the vase.  The thief was not particularly smart, nor especially well-tutored in the ways of the world, but he was a pretty good thief nonetheless and had never been caught in the course of pursuing his trade.  When he heard about the priceless vase and the old Brahmin, he figured this would the one heist that set him up for life so he could finally give up his high-risk career and move on to something more substantial, like kingship!  Late one night while the old man slept the thief crept silently into the tiny hut.  As fate would have it, the moment his hands touched the vase the old man opened his eyes and rose from bed.  After all, he was no longer young and there were many nights when his body forced him awake and sent him trotting for his chamber pot.  This night he looked up and saw the thief with his hands on the vase.  The thief in turn, looked straight into the old man's eyes and struggled valiantly to think up a lie convincing enough to fool someone as wise and learned as an old Brahmin.  However, when he opened his mouth to speak, the old man raised a hand to silence him.  "Don't bother, young man.  I have always wondered when the day would come that someone would need the vase more than I.  Obviously that day is today.  Please take the vase.  Goodness knows you can probably sell it for enough to buy a small kingdom.  With wit and cleverness, a determined king can transform a small land into a large one.  Take it and may the gods shine upon your venture."  Relieved and frightened at the same time, the thief walked off with the vase.  Once he had availed himself of his chamber pot, the old man crawled back into bed and dreamed pleasant dreams of days when he was young.  Oh, and by the way, don't be peeking between the lines looking for a moral.  In this case, there isn't one.

      Today's thought:  Anything worth doing is worth doing right  Our modern world has become complacent.  Partly because we are too busy to bother with details, but also in part because no one considers the details important.  This baffles me.  I have been told I am hopelessly neurotic.  It might be true, but then again, when I set my mind to accomplishing something I always cross the t's and dot the i's.  Most people don't seem to bother.  For example.  I have lived in Japan for 18 years.  I have been to dozens of Denny's restaurants all over the country, but the only place in Japan where the waitress has offered to fill my coffee cup before it runs dry is in this tiny little farming town where I am now staying.  The day after tomorrow I am returning to Tokyo and the thing I will miss most is not the clean air, beautiful scenery or rich history.  The thing I will miss most is the world-class service I have received at the local Denny's.  I have received friendlier, more attentive service over the past three months than I have ever received at any Denny's anywhere in the world.  This puzzles me to no end.  Don't misunderstand me.  I have loved the fresh country air!  For three months I have woken up every morning without needing to clear out clogged sinus passages.  The air in Tokyo is so bad that every single morning I wake up virtually unable to breathe.  Between molds, mildews, pollens and pollution, it is a wonder I have surived eighteen years without dying of some kind of rare and unusual sinus infection or lung disease.  I have also fallen madly in love with the green hills, flowering fields and endless tracts of rice and truck vegetables.  I could easily spend the next twenty years wandering among Nihonmatsu's hundreds of stelles, graveyards, memorials, rustic temples and ancient shrines.  But despite all that, the one thing I will really miss is one of my two favorite waitresses asking me if I'm ready for my chocolate sunday yet or offering to top up my half-full coffee cup.  Now tell me, why doesn't every Denny's in the world have service this good?  Why don't the waitresses in Tokyo drop by my table every so often and see how I'm doing?  The waitresses in Waikiki don't even offer this kind of service any more!  Why not?  Why is it that the wider the so-called "sevice" economy expands, the worse the service becomes?  Anything worth doing is worth doing right.  If it's not worth doing, why bother?  If it is worth doing, then why are we more concerned with covering our mistakes than improving our weaknesses?  Improving the world begins with improving ourselves.  Why have we forgotten that?

        Raspberry Filled    urlLink   What Kind of Krispy Kreme Doughnut Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Not really.  I haven't even been online for a whole three days!  However, I stopped in at  urlLink Last Day of My Life  and he was a good old-fashioned glazed donut, so I thought, "What the heck!  Can't hurt!", and then skipped over to the quiz.  It was great fun!  An interesting aside:  I have never tasted a Krispy Kreme donut, but I   love   Raspberry jam!

      Well, I guess some things are simply not meant to be.  I bought a book with the Publisher's Edition of Red Hat Linux 9.0, went through all the preparation steps, and installed Linux.  Everything seemed to go fine, until the installer started installing packages to my hard drive.  Suddenly, I was faced with "This version of Red Hat Linux is not compatible with your system" and then the installer exited.  Thinking that maybe my 2.1 Gigabytes of free space was too small, I ran the installer again and this time let Red Hat have the entire 4 Gigabyte hard drive.  No go.  Same error message, same unexpected end to a flawless installation procedure.  On the plus side, by following the instructions in the book to the letter and reading the installation README files and other documentation, everything right up to the last moment went flawlessly.  Because I attempted to let Red Hat have the entire disk, I was left with an empty hard drive, but fortunately I had backed up all my critical data files, so I didn't lose anything important.  Also, the Hewlett Packard O/S recovery disks are the simplest things in the world to use.  Basically, you drop the disk in the drive fire up the computer and answer "yes" a few times.  It completely erases anything currently existing, of course, but since there was nothing on the hard disk this was not a problem.  So now I'm back to sloughing my way through Windows' merciless dialog boxes within dialog boxes in order to accomplish the simplest tasks.  I was really looking forward to finally being able to jump from virtual console to virtual console firing off obscure acronyms from the command line whenever I needed to get something done.  Theoretically I could do something similar by opening a DOS window, but the modern DOS commands are not documented at all, so there is no way to find out which commands still work and which ones have vanished into the mists of O/S obsolesence.  I could attempt some trial and error, but I've fogotten half the commands I used to use instinctively.  I did discover they still have the DOS text editor "Edit", which is a far better tool than the "vim" text editor that comes with Linux.  "Edit" lacks the power and flexibility of "Emacs" and it's built-in LISP programming language, but everything in life is a trade off.  All is not lost, however.  I installed the Java 2 SDK, and I am looking forward to spending the next few months studying Java while I save up my nickels and dimes until I have enough to either buy a computer that comes with Linux pre-installed, or buy one that is certain to be Linux compatible.  I have also installed Quincy 99, a C++ IDE based on the Intel compatible version of the GNU Gcc compiler, so if I get bored with Java I can study C++ and have two programming languages under my belt when I finally get a chance to work with Linux.  I know, I seem a bit obssessed.  I guess I am.  Perhaps a little history is in order.  My first computer was an 80286 with an EGA monitor and a whopping 20 megabyte hard disk.  It came with DOS 3.0 and I quickly learned to love it!  Then, just when I finally got comfortable with DOS and installed my very first C compiler, my world turned upside down.  Next thing I know I'm staring at a screen full of blue windows every time I try to do something more difficult than save a file.  Under Windows 3.1 I discovered that half the commands I'd been using every day no longer functioned reliably.  My C compiler refused to compile, my lovely batch files that greeted me and responded to my every whim no longer worked at all, and on top of everything else, SimLife refused to run.  My second computer was a 486DX2-66 and I  hated  it!  It's been all downhill ever since.  When I first heard about Linux in 1990 or so I felt saved, but Linux did not support my hardware.  Worst of all, the installation routines of the day were cryptic and for my limited intellect, completely undecipherable.  Red Hat Linux 7.3 finally started looking like something I could at least install, but at the time my hardware was inadequate.  Finally, just this past summer, it appeared my hardware capacity and Red Hat's new installation package has reached a point of new-age equinamity.  Alas, it was close but not close enough.  Still, things are finally at the point where I might one day realistically have the opportunity to return to my first love: command lines and batch files.  I am completely sold on the philosophy of Open Source software and I long for the day when I can upload my very own software creations for the world's perusal.  No, they will not be great nor will they be memorable, but that's okay; they will be the best I can build, and that's got to count for something.

      First read this:  urlLink Microsoft Weighs Automatic Updates   Now I am no conspiracy theorist, but it seems to me that this takes us one step closer to Big Brother.  Granted, the conditions are extreme, however, I cannot help but wonder who has the time, resources, and experience to create the kind of successful viruses we have seen since the beginning of the year.  Whoever is responsible for SoBig.F, Blaster, and so on, must be intimately familiar with Microsoft products, and especially with those product's powerful undocumented features.  I can only think of one organization that harbors people with that kind of knowledge and experience, and it certainly isn't  urlLink King Mongkut's School of Technology .  A friend once sent me a joke about exposing a Windows CD to flame and reading the words:  One O/S to rule them all, One O/S to find them, One O/S to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.   Suddenly it's not so funny.

      It all started in the mid-eighties.  Computers leapt from cute gadgets that did nothing to the heart of home entertainment, education, and mortgage management.  In the midst of the upheaval, a graduate student in Finland wondered why multitasking processors were still burdened with a single tasking operating system and decided to do something about it.  In the frigid north a Penguin came forth and set out to conquer the world.  Linux was born.  Now, a lifetime later, Linux is a major operating system capable of being used on everything from portable phones to supercomputers.  Desktops and laptops are both available with Linux pre-installed and ready to run.  Corporations like Sun and IBM depend on it both to run their own systems and to keep their customer's systems running smoothly.  Not bad for a "free" operating system anyone can have by purchasing a $20 book with a couple CDs glued in the back.  My own search for freedom from the domination of all things Microsoft began here:  urlLink Linux Game Development .  Sadly, the site has not been updated in a year.  More ominous yet, a retailer of Linux games,  urlLink LokiSoft , appears to have gone out of business a couple years ago.  The downside of "free" is that no one makes any money, and without money, no one stays in business.  So what brings my meandering mind into this neighborhood on this sunny summer day?  This:  urlLink The Penguin's Progress .  One pro-Linux solutions provider decided that the only way they could survive would be to assert the kind of control over Linux that Microsoft has asserted over Windows.  In order to bring this "free" operating system under their control, they acquired all the patents connected with Unix, which Linux is very loosely based on, and for their first legal action took on the biggest player in the Linux world: they sued IBM.  Humor is always the forte of the scorned, and one Linux supporter has "waxed Shakespearean" in a most literary account of the recent  urlLink "mud" slinging:  urlLink Blind, Furry, and Signifying Nothing .  Insane fool that I am, I figure there is only one way to resolve this crisis in the computer world.  Yesterday I ordered half a dozen books about Linux, two of which include Red Hat 9.  By the end of the month I will be running Linux on my clunky HP Pavillion, by the end of the year I will have a brand-new Linux-based Sony Vaio from  urlLink Emperor Linux .  There is nothing I love more than an underdog with nothing to lose and everything to gain.  IBM is certain to defeat SCO in their ill-conceived attempt to dominate the free world.  Linux will never be as popular or as easy to use as Windows, which makes it the perfect operating system for crazy non-conformists like myself.  The only way to be free is to break the chains that bind you.  The only way to break the chains of social conformity is to be lunatic enough to dream of being different.  Open Source world here I come!  Something tells me no one will notice.

      Okay, the time has come to set the record straight.   I am clinically insane!   Got that?  Are we clear on that point?  I am a complete looney, wacko, headcase, or whatever else you want to call it.  When I was 35 or so I realized just how deep my psychosis runs, and I also realized that a good shrink and lots of modern drugs would probably fix me right up.  The downside, of course, is that then I would be just like everyone else.  The one thing I despise most about the modern world is the subtle, incessant, unyeilding drive toward conformity.  No one notices it, but Hollywood, CNN, BBC, NHK, and everyone else is trying to convince us that we each individually need to be rich, beautiful, successful, and most of all,  sane .  I am not sane and never will be.  Insanity is not fun, but it is who I am and for better or worse, I  like  who I am!  Okay, now that we've got that out of the way.  Let me introduce a new person I have learned to love reading:  urlLink What have I become?   Mika, you are beautiful!  Please don't let the modern world tell you otherwise.  I'd leave a comment or drop you an e-mail, but there's no contact information on your blog.  I don't remember how I first found  urlLink What have I become? , but when I landed on the page the very first thing I saw was the link to  urlLink Megatokyo , a webcomic that I dearly love and read daily.  That and  urlLink Sinfest  are my two favorite online comics.  Anyone who reads  urlLink Megatokyo  is a-okay in my book!  So I hung around and started following the adventures of a misplaced upstate New York girl.  She's great!  She enjoys  urlLink Lodoss  and plays  urlLink Magic: the Gathering .  My god!  If I were half my age I'd move to Seattle!  What are you young guys looking for?  Here's a pretty young woman who enjoys the best things in life and  nobody  is chasing her!  And  I'm  the one they call crazy!

      I am happy to see  urlLink Bracing against the wind  back online.  That's the weblog for the person who provides the free comment box I'm using.  The system is clean, simple, and most important of all,   free!    It's a bit slow, but that's okay.  For the price, it's a great value!  Once I learn some modern HTML, I can even customize the appearance of the comment system.  Don't hold your breath, though, that may be awhile!  In my neverending search for alternative views, I have stumbled across one of the most interesting adult weblogs I have ever seen:  urlLink Memories of a Sex Kitten .  It's much different than the usual "sex blog" because rather than telling stories, she recounts her feelings about each encounter.  Most of them seem to have been pleasing enough, but she's also honest about her own shortcomings and the times when her partners could have treated her a lot better.  If raw sex offends you it's not a site you should visit, but if you are open to the full range of human experience than her perspective is definitely worth reading.

         Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!     Things are not going well today.  Just for starters, I dropped by my blog today to discover that the Javascript connected to the free comment system provided by  urlLink Documentroot.com  had locked up my blog.  Why?  Because for some reason the  urlLink Documentroot.com  server is down.  The only way I could find to fix the problem was to remove the comment box link.  I suppose if I knew Javascript I could write a short error-checking script to compensate for this kind of problem, but if I knew Javascript I wouldn't have needed to rely on  urlLink Documentroot.com  in the first place!  I'll probably still use them once the server goes back online, but I really hate it when this kind of thing happens!  So anyway, I finally get that cleared up, and then I write a nice little post hailing  urlLink mad wench in the attic  and  urlLink Carved in Silicon  as two of my favorite reads, but I hit the wrong button and the post vanished instead of being published.  On top of everything else, it's pouring down rain in Tokyo.  Yesterday I had to take   four   fifteen-minute bicycle rides in the pouring rain in order to get back and forth to work.  Today, I will eventually have to take two more just to do my weekly shopping.  It will still be raining tomorrow, so in order to see  urlLink Hero   I will have to ride my bike back and forth to the train station in pouring rain yet again!   Farmers might need the rain but I certainly  don't !  On days like this I feel like hibernating.   I know!  I know!    Nothing   hibernates in summer.

      Reading through a dozen or so random blogs and diaries tonight has set me to wondering if my own blog is too bland.  For some reason, every blog I stumbled across as I wandered through this oddly narcissistic neighborhood of cyberspace was built around some kind of platform.  Pro-Semitic/Anti-Semitic seems to be a rising phenomenom, but there are also pro-my-favorite-religion/anti-your-favorite-religion platforms in abundance.  One blog meandered as badly as my own as the writer jumped from one platform to another trying to find something to believe in.  I guess that's the real problem, there's nothing I believe in.  No, that's not exactly right either, because there are in fact many things I believe in:  Being a person is more important than being a "man", a "woman", a "banker", a "programmer", an "artist", or any other "thing". Tolerance is the least popular and most important ideal. All gods are manifestations of our own longing for something greater than the daily grind that is our reality. The difference between history and mythology is the person telling the tale, not the tale itself. Love is the most exciting, stimulating, frustrating, infuriating, life-giving, life-stealing, confusing experience known to humankind. Hate is either love in disguise or a manifestation of our own personal fears, and sometimes both at once. Death is a gateway, although I have no idea what is waiting on the other side.  Now comes the hard part.  How do I mold these disparate ideas, many of which are only half-formed, into a precise stance that can be argued both philosophically and religiously?  Then again, why should I?  Do I need a platform of my own?  Are there advantages to running around tooting my own horn and declaring that I alone among the 6 billion plus current inhabitants of planet Earth have access to truth, reality, and the path to a higher plane of consciousness?  Assuming of course that I believe in a higher plane of consciousness.  Honestly speaking, I'm not at all certain that I do.

      Reality confuses me.  I guess I am just not smart enough for the modern world.  Right now I am watching an NHK special featuring colorized film footage from WWII.  I'm not playing close enough attention to understand the narration, but the footage itself is dramatic in ways that defy description.  I wish they would broadcast this kind of thing during the day instead of daylight television's endless cooking programs or hour after hour of middle-aged actors in failing careers wandering from station to station looking for unique restaurants and businesses.  On the other hand, there are no more late night sex shows.  Once upon a time in Japan, after 11:00 at night half the local channels offered reviews of adult films, talk shows with half-naked women decorating the background, or even "interviews" with topless dancers, porn stars, and "soapland" girls proudly displaying their finest wares while they discussed the habits of their patrons.  More often than not the shows were silly rather than sexy, but at least they were a change from endless shows recounting the virtues of ramen.  What confuses me is not that these shows once existed, but that they have vanished.  I enjoyed the late night shows.  Sometimes they were arousing, but mostly the silliness of it all made sex seem like a nice, harmless pastime for consenting adults.  The lack of these shows, and their replacement with golf lessons, extra news broadcasts, and gossip programs, puts sex into the kind of "dirty little secret" closet that American media works so hard to keep it in.  At the same time, cable companies in Japan have introduced three different adult channels.  One of these specializes in rape videos, extreme s/m videos, and bondage flicks that often end in gang rape.  This is beginning to look like popularization of the worst forms of pornography.  By saying "worst", of course, I'm offering a moral judgement that many people will disagree with.  This also confuses me.  Where is the entertainment value in watching a young woman be brutalized?  Why do people find rape and extreme s/m an appealing fantasy?  I can understand sexual fantasy, naturally.  I have a few of my own favorite fantasies, and I have seen a number of erotic and pornographic movies that were entertaining, arousing, and featured consenting adults enjoying sex together.  I am not opposed to pornography simply because it features people having sex.  As a matter of fact, if you're not in the mood to watch it, pornography gets very boring very quickly.  I do not, however, support the dehumanization of female performers simply because they're female.  So where do I draw the line?  I personally draw it at anything which features one person humiliating another.  Our modern world has mostly abandoned slavery and blood-bound class societies because these forms of social organization did more harm than good.  Nonetheless, attitudes of elistism run through every aspect of our modern world.  The simultaneous abandonment of soft pornography on late-night Japanese television with the popularization of a cable channel devoted to rape (not to mention the increasing frequency of date rape) tells me that elitism is rearing its ugly head once again.  Sweeping sex under the carpet won't make it go away, it will only encourage the idea that sex is something dirty, and once that assumption has been made, then sex becomes another valid avenue for the dehumanization of one group of people by another.  Encouraging soft porn might raise eyebrows and cause some people to turn away in disgust, but if sex cannot be discussed freely and openly, then we pave the way for something far worse: self-righteous intolerance.  Oh, and one last note.  I do not think opening our world to soft pornography automatically removes romance.  Quite the contrary.  A good erotic program will find ways to appeal to both men and women.

      For once the critics were right.  "Pirates of the Carribbean" is a rolicking good jaunt through the Carribbean with a ghost ship manned by an undead crew, a stone crypt of cursed gold, the most entertaining pirate captain since "Cutthroat Island", and enough special effects to thrill the most jaded audience.  Scenes and characters from the Disney ride are recreated with eerie authenticity, to the point that future historians may well find themselves arguing over which came first.  If you can only make it to one movie this summer, see Pirates.

      I spent all day Saturday in Gamer's Heaven.  Well, all right, it was really only the 2003 Tokyo Game Show, but it felt like heaven to me!  The good news is gaming is alive and well and, judging from the huge crowds bubbling with enthusiasm, will be for a long time to come.  I saw previews and sampled demo programs for dozens of RPG style games, some 2D and some 3D, some humorous, some serious, some heavenly, some quaint, and all more highly addictive than designer drugs!  Who needs acid dreams when  urlLink Neverwinter Nights  is a mere mouse click away?  Why descend into alcoholism when  urlLink Lineage II  beta testing starts in a few weeks?  Why grab a shotgun and shoot up the local post office when  urlLink Ragnarok  is filled with monsters just waiting for you to take out your aggressions on them?  And, if you're short on cash, or just plain unwilling to pay for your fun,  urlLink Runescape  is free!  So what are you waiting for?   "Would you like to play a  urlLink game ?"

        urlLink Mary Carey for Governor    I know, everyone favors the name power and Hollywood fame of  urlLink Arnold .  In truth, Arnold does have some interesting  conventional  ideas for solving California's problems.  On the other hand, so did Gray Davis, the fool who got us into this mess to begin with.  Mary Carey, on the other hand, has some silly, but nonetheless potentially trendsetting ideas for solving the problems of massive debt, staggering unemployment, the growing AIDS epidemic, and funding for hospitals and health care.  To my own suprise, a visit to her website and a review of her speeches reveals that behind the headline setting silliness is a serious mind that has done considerable research into the problems and issues facing the next governor of California.  True, she has some extreme ideas, such as offering porn videos to anyone who turns in a handgun and transforming the governor's mansion into a pay-per-view webcam site, but she also wants to encourage greater celebrity-backed charities for California hospitals and taxes on plastic surgery.  As an aside, it strikes me that Mary Carey's "taxes on breast implants" idea is absolutely ingenious!  Cosmetic surgery is a multi-billion dollar luxury industry that does not pay any kind of sales or consumption taxes.  Can you imagine a Hollywood director NOT paying taxes on his new Masseratti?  So why doesn't his wife pay taxes on her liposuction belly and silicone breasts?  The revenue generated by treating elective surgery as a consumer item has the potential to add millions to California coffers.  Let me close this "radical" note by adding that I've never seen a Mary Carey film or video, nor am I a member of her fan club.  Prior to her bid for the governorship I'd never heard of her.  However, despite having been a long time fan of Arnold, I'm hoping Mary takes the election by storm and wins by a landslide.  Besides, I've always had a soft spot for an underdog.

        urlLink The Falling Man    Click on it.  Read it.  And always remember that reality is both horrifying and beautiful.  History is not only what we read in books.  History is what we create with every decision we make.  We live in the midst of chaos.  This chaos is disordered, confusing, frightening, and sometimes enlightening.  In order to live our lives to the fullest we must not run from the chaos that surrounds us, we must instead embrace it.  Instead of struggling to control this chaos, we must learn to ride it out, regardless of how we feel about the place it carries us.  Most people in the "civilized" world spend their lives running from the things they fear.  This is, of course, a perfectly natural reaction and has insured the survival of the human species in many situations.  However, one of the chief differences between humans and other animals is that we have the ability to turn and face the things we fear.  We can choose to stand and fight, or even to stand, observe, and learn.  Some primates will turn and fight for a moment or two, but only humans have the capacity to face their worst nightmares and learn from them.  The lessons learned then become the basis for new decisions, decisions which alter our actions the next time we encounter the same nightmare.  Every decision you make changes the world around you.  Are you making it a better place?  Better for who?

      A god-awful long time ago a middling poet was paid a huge sum of money to create an epic that would grant the Roman Empire the kind of prestige the Greeks had earned by sacking a trading port called Troy and then singing about it in dark taverns filled with drunken men.  Instead, he wrote a story of hell, paradise and lost hope.  Dante's  urlLink Divine Comedy  is not the least bit funny, nor is it intended to be.  "Comedy" and "tragedy" were more closely linked in the Roman imagination than they are in ours, and in many cases were used interchangeably.  Why bring this up today?  For the same reason CNN is blathering on about the victims of 9/11.  The terrorist attack against the World Trade Center was a terrible tragedy, but it was also comic.  No doubt there will be many people out there today making odd, perverse, and twisted jokes about the number of people who died, the nihilistic and narcissistic American response, the ego-centric responses of the Arabic world, and of course, the draconian increase in security measures worldwide that will, in the end, do little or nothing to prevent the next dramatic act of terrorism.  As a species it seems we will never learn that you cannot stop someone so intent on reaching their goals their own life means nothing to them.  Rather than stopping the terrorists, we need to focus our energies on developing social, cultural, and political systems with greater sensitivity to the needs of the underpriviledged, the lost, the abandoned, the desperate, and the insane.  Until we create a world where all people have the same opportunities for self-expression regardless of whether or not we agree with them, we will continue to have men and women so desperate on voicing their anger and dissatisfaction with prevailing social conditions that they have no choice but to resort to guns, bombs, and airplanes used as guided missles.  The more you disagree with someone, the more important it is to listen carefully to what they have to say and then take the time to seriously consider their opinion.  Right and wrong are   never   the issue.  The real issue is how deeply we value one another's feelings, perceptions, and realities.  The only way to prevent another 9/11 is to give the terrorists nothing to be angry about.    As an aside:  Many years ago I was a devout Christian.  I evangelized among prostitutes, fed the homeless, visited prisons, bought food for hitchikers, and so on.  I lived out the Christian life to the best of my ability.  In all that time, my worst critics were other Christians.  I was accused of paying prostitutes for sex (to this day I've never had sex with one, let alone paid for it), preferring the company of street people to "decent law-abiding folk" (absolutely! still do!), and supporting the lifestyles of society's outcasts by catering to their needs rather than pounding them over the head with my Bible.  Finally, I got fed-up.  I drifted away from Christianity, and eventually abandoned it altogether.  Now I have no firm religious beliefs of any kind.  If gods and demons exist, I've seen little evidence of it outside the hearts and minds of the human species.  The intolerance of my fellow Christians drove me away from Christianity for good.  I had no argument with the Bible, nor with living the Christian life, I just couldn't bear the company of self-righteous and hypocritic Christians and depite over a decade of active involvement, never really found any other kind.  Until now.   urlLink Are You Tolerant  is an article dealing with the issure of tolerance and modern Christianity.  It is long, a tad confusing, and rather dry reading.  Also, it never reaches any firm conclusion, which is something modern Christians have no tolerance for.  Far too many of them want the world to be cleanly divided into two camps of good and evil, with themselves in the good camp.  This inability to come to a firm conclusion is the core weakness of the article, but it is also its greatest strength.  If I had encountered more Christians who understood and applied the ideas in this article, I would probably still be attending church every Sunday, reading my Bible every night, and carrying street people to the hospital in my own car.  I also wouldn't be writing this weblog, but on the other hand, neither would the world need to hear the things I have to say.

I want things neat, ordered, and adult--fine wine instead of french fries, mai tais  by the pool instead of beach sand between my toes. Now if only my fellow adults would stop acting like such, well, children!    urlLink   How Old is Your Inner Child?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Hmm.  I am 42, so my inner child is three years older than I am.  I don't know whether this is good news or a terrible tragedy.  I would cry, "I want my Mommy!", but she died in March.

      Tokyo today is hot, sunny, and mildly humid.  A brilliant summer day.  If more days were like this I would have grown to love summer here a long time ago.  Sadly, today is the exception.  The majority of days are either grey, overcast, broiler hot and unbearably humid, or cold, miserable, and rainy.  In all my many travels, Tokyo has the most unusual summer weather I have ever seen.

       urlLink Last Day of my LIfe  has inspired me again!  This time, straight into the depths of  urlLink Dante's Inferno :  The Dante's Inferno Test has banished you to the Second Level of Hell!  Here is how you matched up against all the levels: Level           | Score Purgatory       | Very Low Level 1 - Limbo | Moderate  Level 2 | Very High  Level 3         | High Level 4         | Very Low Level 5         | Low Level 6 - The City of Dis | Very High Level 7         | High Level 8- the Malebolge | Moderate Level 9 - Cocytus | Low             urlLink Level descriptions       urlLink Take the test    Level 2 , the land of lust and depravity, it looks like I'll be spending eternity with Helen of Troy and Cleoptra!  And they call this " suffering "?  Why Level 2?  It seems I am overly fond of the opposite sex.  Even though I have never used deceit, drugs, or alcohol to seduce a woman, even though I have never seduced a woman just because she was good looking only to abandon her in the morning, and even though I have never cheated on my wife, I am still too perverse for the likes of heaven.  You know, somehow it doesn't bother me in the least!  To spend eternity surrounded by the likes of Cleopatra and Helen of Troy sounds like heaven to me!  With a hell like this, who needs salvation?

      Over the past couple of weeks I've been busy playing  urlLink Priston Tale , an online RPG style game from Korea.  They are now beta testing Japanese, English and Chinese clients, so I downloaded and installed the Japanese client on my new computer.  The game, for me, lacks any kind of depth.  It's really nothing more than running around killing monsters and occasionally teaming up with other players to venture into areas of the online world where the higher level monsters hang out.  There is no "market" in the virtual towns where players and non-player characters (NPCs) can set up shops offering equipment, virtual food and drink, and so on.  Each town does have a few game-necessary shops: two weapons shops, a potion seller, a weapons upgrader, a skill trainer and a warehouse for storing items or coins, but the interactions are extremely simple and there is no provision for players who want to sell items they've recovered in the field.  As a result, players tend to gather around the warehouse offering their findings to the highest bidder, which makes it almost impossible to get into the warehouse when you need to drop off or retrieve something.  Still, to my own surprise I have found the game to be incredibly addictive.  The multitude of features that must be balanced in order to move through the levels is challenging enough to keep my constant attention.  When I'm playing the game the minutes literally become hours.  The other day I logged on after dinner and started playing and when I looked up a short time later I was surprised to discover it was one o'clock in the morning!  Of course, since the client and my desktop system are both in Japanese, there are many times when I am guessing at what a particular button will accomplish or whether a sword is better than an axe for fighting a certain monster, but by and large I have not found the interface difficult to navigate, despite the language barrier.  On another track, I recently installed Microsoft Front Page (the Japanese version, of course), on my new system and set about attempting to update  urlLink Greyhawk Manor .  When I uploaded everything I was shocked to discover my hosting company did not support Front Page.  Realistically speaking, this is probably a good thing because there are many holes in the Front Page extensions that hackers can use to gain access to a website, but it did complicate uploading the new pages by forcing me to download an FTP client and upload the old-fashioned way.  Once everything loaded I was horrified to discover that Apache is case-sensitive!  What this means is that many of my graphics do not load because Apache cannot connect a call to "hono001.jpg" to a file named "HONO001.jpg", so my website now looks even more amateurish than it already did!  Oh well, I guess I'll just have to go through and rename all my graphics files.  It will take time, but very few people visit my website anyway, so anyone who drops by will just have to tolerate the mess until I have a chance to get it cleaned up.  I hate housecleaning, especially virtual housecleaning!  Oh, and in closing:      Morpheus    urlLink   ?? Which Of The Greek Gods Are You ??     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      I am Morpheus, but then, you already knew that.  I'll see you tonight.

      It finally hit me today: my mother is dead and there is no going home for Christmas.  I don't know why it came out of left field and whacked me upside the head this late in the game.  She died last spring, but then again, I haven't been home for the holidays in at least a decade, so why this year, and why two days late?  I don't know.  I'd ask my shrink, but I don't have one.  I spent the day in a sort of blue fog that would have made things touchy, but everyone in my little nuclear family is too preoccupied with their own lives to notice.  My wife and younger son spent the day getting ready to head off to visit her parents.  We spend every New Year's at her parents house.  I'm not sure why it worked out that way, but it did.  I'm not bitter, mind you, but today I spent a lot of time wondering if things should have been more even-handed.  For the next two days only my elder son and I will be home, and he'll mostly be hanging out with his baseball team.  Lots of internet game time, and then I climb on a bus and spend five hours riding down to visit a family that works really hard trying to make me feel at home but never quite manages it.  Not their fault, mine.  Despite my best intentions, at heart I'm still an American and I feel it the most during the winter holidays.  We put the Christmas tree away today.  My Japanese wife baked an American-style apple pie.  Is it irony, clairvoyance, or some perverse form of poetic justice?  Doesn't matter.  The pie is sweetly delicious and so is she.

      When I was in high school I began reading the works of Robert A. Heinlein.  At the time, the most important thing in the world was a rollicking adventure, a tough hero, and a beautiful damsel in distress.  His books contained all that, and much more.  Much to my own surprise, I never came away from a Heinlein book without something to think about. His books always contained some idea so dramatically in contradiction with the values of those around me it seemed unthinkable.  Robert Heinlein's books made me question the accepted definitions of love, freedom, and independence.  His sardonic wit and clear-eyed analysis of the world around him pulled me into my own patterns of constant questioning and never settling for a simple answer.  Science fiction taught me to look at the world and see it not for what I want it to be, or even for what I think it should be, but purely for what it is.  Robert Heinlein's fiction convinced me to focus on facts.  Now I am a much older man.  I am forty-two, and even that will change in a few more months.  The other day I pulled my copy of "Time Enough for Love" off my shelf, dusted it off, and began reading.  What once seemed nothing more than a simple tale of an old man whose friends talked him into rediscovering the joy of living has become a complex tapestry of interlinked epics touching on the lessons of history, the value of love, and what it means to be human.  Sub-plots like the computer Minerva's craving to be human weave together themes from Pinocchio, Little Mermaid, and even Cinderella.  Mini-epics like "Tale of the Adopted Daughter" are packed solid with hidden allusions to mythologies so old no one can say for certain when or where they actually began.  Ishtar and Dumuzi, Samson and Delilah, Persephone and Hades are all hiding just below the surface waiting patiently for the inquisitive mind to discover them.  Robert Heinlein's "cheap" science fiction contains so many references to so many different cultures it's no wonder so many people find it shallow and meaningless.  It's easy to dismiss something you don't really understand.

      The Japan Closed Beta for Lineage II ended on January 26.  Now I am gnawing away my fingertips waiting for the Open Beta which will finally start on Feb. 11.  In order to help the time pass more quickly, I've been hanging out at  urlLink Universal Realms , posting in the forums, browsing their immense database on gameplay and game items, and so on.  However, it struck me today that despite six-plus years of active Usenet participation, I have not scanned a single Usenet post in close to two years.  Well, that seemed like a good excuse to skip over to  urlLink Google  and see what kind of buzz Usenet was generating on the single greatest game since Space Invaders.  I found four posts, all over a year old.  Whoa!  Has the world changed so much in such a short time?  Is the long predicted end of Usenet finally in sight?  Probably not.  There are hundreds of thousands of other very active topics, but Lineage II is not one of them.  Methinks the reason is actually quite simple.  The kind of people who love Lineage II are visually oriented.  We have little or no experience with  urlLink text-based MUDs , and even less interest.  Some folks do combine role-playing and fantasy writing with their Lineage II experience, but the game itself is so consuming that 99% of the participants would rather spend their online time playing than fantasizing.  The game is so compelling that dozens of Americans are downloading the Chinese client and playing in the Taiwan Open Beta even though they cannot understand a single word of the chat dialogues, NPC dialogues, quest dialogues, and so on.  They cannot read a single line of text, not even a weapon description, but they are in the gameworld, exploring the countryside, killing monsters, joining or starting clans, and everything else the game allows.  There is no other game in the world, online or otherwise, that can inspire that kind of fevered obssession.  When this game goes retail the concerns and outcry over online addictions will jump tenfold, but even they will not be able to stop the stampede.  Cyberspace is rapidly approaching the Sci-Fi fantasy/nightmare of an alternate reality so compelling that lives vanish, cities are abandoned, and civilization collapses.  There has not been a Pandora's box like this one since the Age of Exploration sent European visionaries scrambling to the four corners of the globe.  I don't know what our future will look like.  I'm pretty sure it won't be a Gibsonesque gothic landscape of cowboys and coporations, but I'm equally certain there are going to be some staggering parallels.  See you in  urlLink Aden , or maybe  urlLink Paragon City .  Then again, it will probably be  urlLink someplace neither one of us can predict .

      I posted this in a forum devoted to Lineage 2 and like it so much I though I' d add it here.  Not that anyone will read it, mind you, but....    Play the Game, Don't Work It  Both here in the forums and in the game I see many players agonizing over their choices.  Pvp vs. non-pvp, book vs. staff, assassin vs. knight, so on and so forth ad continuum, ad nauseum.  Relax, especially during the Beta portion.  Lineage 2, like all MMORPGs, is a game, not a life. First and foremost it is meant to be played, and played hard through many long hours of heart-stopping tension and knee-buckling relief.  Dramatic dissappointment, heroic achievement, devastating loss, and stunning victory are all possible anytime, anywhere, and usually when you least expect it.  The key element of any gaming experience has always been, and always will be, play.  And what exactly is play?  Play, in the end, can and should be a kind of meaningless experimentation.  Play means taking on a different role, a different set of attitudes, and a distinctly different viewpoint from the everyday. If you're not having fun, you're not playing, you're working, and in this case that means working with zero chance of any kind of real-world reward.  Useless work is a fast highway to boredom, depression, and disillusionment.  LIfe is depressing enough, why would anyone want to bring the stress of work into their leisure time?  So, my heartfelt advice is this:  Stop working, start playing  Forget about what's best, strongest, or most likely to win. In Lineage 2 there is no winning and no losing; there is only the game.  If you focus on winning, being the strongest, being the most powerful, and so on, all you are doing is transforming your play into work, and why would you want to do that?  If you can't decide between fighter or mage, create one of each and switch back and forth between them.  True, other characters will advance faster, but what difference does that make?  The important thing is you are developing a deeper feel for the mechanics of the game than any single character player ever will.  If you play a mage on Monday, then take your fighter party hunting on Tuesday, you will be far better prepared to compensate for the mage's lack of toughness by spending as much time protecting them as you do seeking out new monsters.  As a result, your party's healer will live longer, your party will fight harder, and everyone's game time will be more enjoyable.  The reverse is true as well.  On Wednesday you can take the mage out with a party of strangers and you'll be far better at predicting when to sit back and heal, and when to finish off a monster too tough for the fighters to handle.  As a result, your mage will gain a reputation for wisdom as well as skill, and more people will be happy to have you along with they head out after something really big, netting you an even bigger pay-off in cash, items, and those ever-important experience points.  The same holds true for every choice the game brings you.  If you can't decide, then don't decide.  Try every option, visit every city, make money, lose money, gain experience, lose experience, gain items, and lose them, do it all!  You might never be the king of Aden, but hey, there can only be one king, it doesn't have to be you.  Play the game, don't work at it.

      First there was the  urlLink Raspberry Filled Krispy Kreme .  Then there was the  urlLink Second Level of Hell  (Helen and Cleopatra, oh yeah!).  There followed a pause in time to explore my  urlLink ancient inner child , and of course, one mustn't neglect my frequent  urlLink adventures in insanity .  Oh, yes, I almost forgot, I am always the  urlLink eternal dreamer and gameplayer .  But wait!  The best is yet to come!    Magic!    You just gotta love magic. As it turns out, I am indeed, magical!    urlLink        urlLink find your element  at  urlLink mutedfaith.com .    Can't beat that with a stick!  But when you put them all together, where does it really leave me?  Somewhere buried in all these symbols and oddities is hidden the real me, the one who loves playing Lineage II all day long, fishing in quiet country streams, watching NASCAR on ESPN, and reading Harry Potter after the kids have gone to bed.  I am all these things and more, but the one thing I am not, never have been, and never will be, is "normal".   Whatever that means!

        urlLink    My favorite Lineage II character and her pet wolf.  Posted by  urlLink Hello     This is Nightfall.  She is currently my favorite Lineage II character.  Nightfall is a level 18 Dark Elf Mystic, her pet wolf is called Eagle.  When I play Nightfall, I often fall into a fairly feminine style of gameplay.  I suppose she is one incarnation of my female  id ; or, for the more mystical among you, the feminine side of my genderless soul.  Nightfall appeals to me for many reasons.  Just for starters, thanks to the superb artists at NC Soft, she is beautiful to look at.  Equally as important is the simple fact that set amidst the stunning scenery of this awe-inspiring game, she looks completely natural.  Nightfall belongs in her world to an extent that will never be true of I and the world I live in.  This world, the one where you and I work and play, is the problem.  I am a man, a very heterosexual man.  Despite being raped by an uncle when I was five, I have never  desired  to be physically intimate with another man.  Perhaps the molestation is the reason?  I'll leave that question to the Freudians among you.  However, I love playing Nightfall, a very womanly woman.  This poses a problem.  For many players, their character is not really a  character  at all, it is an  avatar , a manifestation of their own self in the gameworld.  Most non-gamers also find this approach very natural and understandable.  As a result, players like myself are accused of being deceptive on some level, as if we were seeking to trick "normal" players into feeling sexually attracted to us.  Perhaps, in some cases, this is true.  In my case, it is not, and I am quick to dissuade any player who approaches Nightfall in a romantic or sexual manner.  I tell them point blank that the real person behind the character is a man, a heterosexual man with no interest in cybersex experimentation within the context of the game.  For most players, there is a moment of surprise, then they move into a semi-detached style of gameplay, treating Nightfall herself as a person and forgetting or ignoring the reality of the person behind her.  For myself, this kind of moderately detached semi-roleplaying, where the characters are independent of the people behind them and yet still not strictly being regarded as actors in a fantasy world, is the most comfortable style of gameplay.  All of Nightfall's friends approach the game in a similar state of semi-detachment, realizing that although they control their characters, the characters are neither direct representations of their native personality, nor completely independent persons fulfilling a predetermined role in a highly stylized fantasy setting.  Within the game we are friends, in the real world we will probably never meet and all of us are comfortable with that.  Did you notice the most important aspect of this kind of gameplay?  Without intending to, my friends and I are redefining community and the dynamics of personal relationships.  Perhaps, in the real world, most "normal" people are able to live their lives in a similar kind of roleplaying, but for people like me, this is impossible.  The real world is too real, too immediate, too painful, and too emotionally charged.  I and people like me cannot treat those we meet in day to day life as if they were acting out some kind of semi-detached role seperate from their "real" selves.  The view you present me is the view I expect to be real because I am right there in the world and I cannot separate the "real" me.  The me you see, is me, 100%, all the time.  When I was young, we called this "sincerity".  Nowadays people call it neurotic.  Online gaming gives sincere people the opportunity to distance themselves from a relationship while still allowing them the intimacy they need.  Other "normal" people, consider this online detachment a reflection of mental illness.  They call us "genderbenders", or "crossdressers", and accuse us of being everything from hopelessly neurotic to despicably evil.  The same people who accuse me of being deceptive think nothing of lying to me about their plans, cheating me at work and in business, ignoring or forgetting social engagements, and otherwise behaving in ways designed to advance themselves while destroying me all in the name of "fairplay" in our Darwinian modern world of fast talk, fast deals, and "always look out for number one" hypercompetition.  I'm sorry.  I'm 43 years old and I still don't understand why I'm the crazy one.

        urlLink    Last Day of Prelude  Posted by  urlLink Hello      urlLink "Lineage II: the Chaotic Chronicle" , is slated to be released in fourteen installments (called "Chronicles", of course).  The first Chronicle, "Harbingers of War", starts in about 12 hours.  Between the end of "Prelude" and the beginning of "Harbingers" is a day of server resets, downloading the new client, etc.  A day of meditation as it were.  The picture above, my current desktop, is a picture of Nightfall and her pet wolf Eagle at the point where I logged off.  She is now level 25, while Eagle has managed to achieve level 16.  It is very difficult to increase the level of a pet wolf, so I am quite satisfied with 16.  Level 25 is not a stunning achievement for two months of game time, but I also spent dozens, and maybe even hundreds of hours experimenting with other characters.  Each character has their own unique characteristics, their own unique strengths and weaknesses, and yet, the game is clearly designed so that each character will fulfill a particular role in both the individual team they belong to, and the world as a whole.  Nightfall, for example, is a Dark Wizard.  Her primary role is to damage enemy monsters and players through a variety of very effective spells, or to summon a special creature and send that creature into battle in support of her team.  She can also be effective on her own, which is how I spend most of my game time.  A fair question to ask is what I get out of this game, and that is why I have spent my day pondering this question.  I love this game for many, many reasons, but mostly for the quality of the graphics.  I love watching the game.  I have used a program called  urlLink FRAPS  to make dozens of video captures of the game.  With my trusty  urlLink Flasher  screensaver, all of these videos display in random order whenever my computer is idle, so even when I am not playing Lineage II, I can enjoy the sounds and sights of this incredible world.  I have videos of almost every character I have ever created (since downloading FRAPS halfway through the Japan Open Beta), so even when I only play one character (such as my focus on Nightfall in recent weeks), I can revisit some of my earlier triumphs and failures.  I deeply love this game.  Calling it my "obsession" would be putting it mildly.  Don't get me wrong.  I know it is only a game.  I don't get angry, depressed, or stressed out when things are not going my way.  Because I know it is only a game, my failures and mistakes are completely unimportant while my successes can leave me smiling for days on end.  It is, by far, the most entertaining pastime I have ever experimented with.  It is more fun than playing either a board game or a video game, it is more rewarding than either writing or reading stories and novels, it is more satisfying than eating a dozen donuts and washing them down with the finest Chocolate Macadamia Nut Kona coffee.  It fills the empty hours of my life with more good times than wine, women and song ever hoped to provide.  Graphics are what drew me in, gameplay is what keeps me there.  Let me draw a parallel.  If I spend 40 hours a week teaching (which would drive anyone insane), what do I have to show for it?  Money, and a lot of it.  But what happens to all that money?  It pays the rent, it feeds my family, it puts clothes on my kid's backs, sends my wife to a hot spring with her friends, and if I'm lucky, buys me a night on the town.  I'm sorry, but none of these things really please me.  At the end of the week my life on the whole has not improved one bit.  I am still poor, stuck in a dirty, crowded city, and come Monday, it's back to work and do it all over again.  Does life in the modern world really please people?  Are other men as content as they appear with nothing more than forty years of working to make others rich and your family fed and clothed?  I'm sorry, but this is   not   my idea of a good life.  I need to feel like I have made some kind of difference in the world around me, and in my own place in it.  Real life leaves me hollow and exhausted both emotionally and physically.  I hate my reality and the small pleasures of seeing my family (who generally treat me like furniture) clothed and fed are no pleasures at all.  I am a wage slave and what slave ever felt content?  Now, if I spend ten hours a week playing Lineage II, at the end of the week Nightfall has a better weapon, has moved into a better hunting area, has gained a good bit of gold, and I'll have met hundreds of new people from all over the world.  I'll have taken her through new and marvelous   countryside   with bright sun, singing birds, gentle breezes, a harvest moon like nothing the real world could ever provide, and together we'll have defeated countless monsters and probably a few really nasty people.  Ten hours with Nightfall and I feel like a hero.  Forty hours of work and I feel like a slave.  Is it really so surprising that I prefer the world of Lineage II?

        urlLink    Up, up and away!  Posted by  urlLink Hello     This new "Hello" photoblogging program by Blogspot is great!  I've just learned how to post my desktop (which you see hovering above) or even a screenshot of a window.  But onto other, hopefully deeper issues.  What is "normal"?  This is a question that has bothered me for most of my life.  Everywhere I go, and I have been many places, people develop images of me that never match the image I have in my own mind.  One problem that often arises is that no one has ever considered me to be "normal".  I am 43 years old, I have a loving wife and two strong, strapping sons.  We live in a (by Tokyo standards) spacious and comfortable apartment in a good neighborhood.  Not only am I gainfully employed, but my wife is starting her own company and very soon I will be working two jobs.  Yet, no one considers me "normal".  To the locals I will always be a "foreigner": woefully ignorant of common sense and hopelessly self-centered.  This, despite the fact that the Japanese themselves are among the most self-centered, self-referential people in the entire world.  The "ugly American" hanging out in topless bars in Paris is certainly no worse than the "ugly Japanese" hanging out in Thai whorehouses that specialize in providing "fresh, young talent" (in other words, boys and girls around ten years old).  Still, I am the oddball, because rather than skipping into Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, or even Paris, for a bit of sexual adventurism (not that I'm  opposed , mind you, just broke and paranoid), I am the crazy foreigner who plays a female character in an online game.  Oh, a word about those Thai whorehouses, what most people don't realize and refuse to see is that they cater to  both  men and women.  Contrary to popular belief, pedophilia crosses all boundaries, including gender.  Oh wait, I know.  "Normal" is you and your second spouse (having been divorced once, you see) living in a three-bedroom house with two-car garage in the suburbs, kids in private schools, a gas-guzzling SUV out front and a pool in the backyard.  And how do you pay for all this?  By being the best cost-cutter in a Fortune 500 company and initiating a plan to outsource the customer service department to India, Thailand, or the Phillipines, creating 50,000 more jobs in the world's poorest countries (a good thing) and putting 40,000 of your own hardworking countrymen into the unemployment queue.  But hey, they can always get jobs at your competitor right?  Except that in order to compete with  your  Fortune 500 company, now  every  Fortune 500 company  must  outsource their customer service department.  But I know, "normal" people don't worry about that.  CNN claims that one million new jobs have been created since the beginning of the year.  How many of those are government jobs at the state and local level (requiring local tax increases) in order to staff the now overflowing and hopelessly backlogged unemployment offices?  But I suppose "normal" people don't worry about that either.  Like it or not, our entire globe has become elaborately interlinked and completely interdependent.  If India raises taxes, Americans feel the bite in higher prices for textiles and clothing.  When Thailand closes a whorehouse, Australian and German tourist agencies lose money and cut employees (even if the individual agents themselves don't sell "sex tours").  If you call in sick for work because the sun is shining and you'd rather go fishing, your best friend from college will have to pay a higher price for his shiny new Italian sports car.  So what does any of that have to do with the price of tea in China?    Everything!

        urlLink    Fireworks for Halloween!  Posted by  urlLink Hello     Meet Mr. Lesser Dark Horror, the scourge of the swamp in Dark Elf Country in the land of  urlLink Aden .  Lesser Dark Horrors, and their older cousins, Dark Horrors, are extremely powerful for their level, do alot of damage, and are very hard to kill.  Dark Elf Fighters can take them one on one at about level 15, with lots of rest in between to recover their HP (life points).  Dark Elf Mystics avoid them altogether until level 16 or 17, and even then they spend more time running than fighting (called "kiting": hit the monster with a spell, run like the dickens in the opposite direction while the spell recharges, then hit it again.).  To my great surprise, Giantina took on two of them at once at level 13 with almost no difficulty!  I am beginning to think that maybe dwarves are far more versatile than most players imagine.  Of course, Giantina has the advantage of not being my first character.  All of her armor and equipment is the best that money can buy at her level, because I stipped Nightfall in order to equip her.  This gives her strong advantages over "normal" level 13 characters, even the speedy and deadly Dark Elves.  As a matter of fact, a Dark Elf Fighter tried to kill Giantina this morning.  At first, I ran as fast as her little legs could carry her in the other direction, but the Dark Elf was rapidly gaining ground.  Since it had to lead to a fight eventually anyway, I spun the character and attacked head on.  The Dark Elf died in three or four blows.  I don't know who was more shocked, my erstwhile attacker or me!  It was a very enlightening moment for both of us.  I just   love   this game!

        urlLink    Giantina on the attack!  Posted by  urlLink Hello     Meet my newest character: Giantina  Giantina is a dwarf.  The female dwarves have the smallest characters in all of  urlLink Lineage II , so naturally I had to give her an appropriately "giant-sized" name!  The dwarves are one of the hardest characters to play because they have no special fighting skills.  On the other hand, they are the only characters able to create items, and they are very tough.  As a result, they are extremely important to the economy of the world of Aden, and highly valued members of any clan.  On the downside, they tend to be ignored until somebody needs something made.  One player observed, "some days I feel more like a parts factory than a valued member of the team."  I have in the past attempted dwarves, but always gave up.  They are extremely difficult to play at lower levels.  However, with the introduction of Chronicle One, all characters gained a pair of interesting emotes: "laugh" and "socialwaitinga".  I tried a male dwarf first, and the laugh was a great, deep, belly shaking rumble, but the social waiting was merely some boring arm stretching.  So  I tried a female dwarf.  The laugh turned out to be an insanely charming girlish giggle of pure merriment and the social waiting was a backflip that shifts into a handstand with a trillish, "la-de-la-de-la" that makes me chuckle every single time I hear it.  I kept the female dwarf and deleted the male.  Every time I play Giantina I feel like a proud Grandfather showing off the light of his life.  She is just so darned   cute!    A infusion of capital from Nightfall bought Giantina some new armor and a decent mace, but I haven't taken a screenshot yet.  I just love this game!   }-----------------------------{   I found an interesting review of Lineage II at  urlLink AVault .  This is the most balanced of all the online reviews I have read to date.  It covers all the reasons I love the game, and also goes into great detail on the downside (which I mostly ignore).

        urlLink    Misty Memories of Another World   It has been almost three years since a group of terrorists hijacked some planes and destroyed the modern  urlLink Tower of Babel . Three long years of wars in  urlLink Afganistan  and  urlLink Iraq , inspired in no small part by  urlLink American paranoia . And yet, the  urlLink horrible imbalance  in  urlLink quality of life  around the world that generated the  urlLink anger of the terrorists  still remains. In short, nothing has improved and whole lot has actually gotten worse.  Keep this in mind, because the stage we play out our lives upon has a dramatic and lasting impact on each of us individually, often in ways we cannot begin to imagine. My own problems are related to the most innocent of modern devices, the  urlLink credit card . I have been carrying and using a  urlLink Citibank Mastercard  for almost 20 years now. Over the past three years it has become almost impossible for me to use my credit card online. You see, Citibank keeps a database of personal information and when you try to use your credit card online, the personal information you provide at the shopping cart page is compared with the personal information in the database and if they match, the sale is authenticated. But the Citibank database does not like non-US addresses and I have lived and worked in Japan for eighteen years now! Whenever I try to buy something online, the databases don't match, and my purchase is declined. This problem has become noticeable worse ever since 9/11 and in one case, an online store told me straight up that they would not accept an American credit card with an overseas billing address! Part of the problem is that modern American businesses have no motivation to seek out overseas customers. Paranoia and xenophobia have finally replaced greed and covetousness as the primary drive behind American business. Although, in all honesty,  urlLink fear of reprisal  has always played at least a minor role in American business practices.  And not only in America, either, but that is for another day.  That brings us finally to the real point of today's post:  urlLink Magic !  I played  urlLink Magic: the Gathering  ("MTG", to its many online fans) from the spring of 1999 to the summer of 2002. It was, and remains, one of the most challenging and rewarding card games ever invented. My recent return to MTG came about because I cannot play  urlLink Lineage II  at work. At first, I was visiting the forums and posting my very own words of wisdom, but not many people enjoyed reading them. I did not want the immaturity of forum regulars to damage my experience of this great game, so I drifted away from the the discussion groups and began looking around for something else to do when things are slow at work. I wandered into Usenet again, especially  urlLink Cuddleland ,  urlLink AFO , and  urlLink RAP . Usenet does not have as many immature contributors as it once did, but it still remains a wild and woolly place where  urlLink flame wars  rage endlessly and an unwary user could easily find their pride and joy reduced to a heap of useless ash. Not a nice neighborhood, but fun if you can handle the fire and the fury.  Then I broke down and wrote to a friend of mine who works at the company which makes Magic: the Gathering. He dropped the hint that now could be a very rewarding time to return to Magic: the Gathering. Specifically, the next major pro set will be built around Japanese  urlLink legends ,  urlLink folklore , and  urlLink myths . Now how could I refuse such an opportunity?  The new set is called  urlLink "Kamigawa" , which probably means "god river", but could have a dozen different meanings depending on the kanji the designers were thinking of when they came up with the name. Judging from the official introduction (see the link in the last sentence), it will be one of the most dynamic and exciting sets they have ever produced. Well, I want to play it! That in turn meant finding some way to brush up my Magic skills, because MTG is not a simple game. My friend recommended  urlLink Magic Online , which seemed like a fine idea to me! I headed over and downloaded the client, but couldn't get logged on. Why? Because in order to log on I have to pay $9.99 for the client (refundable in store credit, mind you) and the Magic Online store will not accept the credit card I have been carrying and using longer than some of their employees have been alive!  And thus we have the long rant above about American paranoia. I don't know why, but it is getting worse with every passing year. Don't believe me? Check  urlLink CNN !  I don't know what kind of world you kids think you're building, but trust me, when you get to be my age, you'll be very sorry you went about it this way.

        urlLink      I finally got bored with hitting critters over the head with an iron hammer. I put Giantina on hold for a little while and pulled Nightfall back out again. Of course, the first problem was that she was naked and weaponless! Not to worry, I headed out to the swamp in the dark elf territories and hunted Dark Horrors and Marsh Zombie Lords using nothing but her magic skills. Since she had no wand or robes, her casting speed was unbelievably slow, but with care and attention to timing, I was able to kill enough monsters to make enough adena (Lineage II money) to buy her a simple leather robe set, complete with gloves, shoes, and cap. That left the issue of what to do for a weapon. Well, Giantina has not been idle, you know, and Nightfall's old gear is what provided the cash to get Giantina going, so Giantina contributed 120,000 adena to the cause and Nightfall got a new staff (called a "Journeyman's Staff"). Not a particularly good one, but a staff. Armed with staff and robes, she hunted much more efficiently and after a week or so, had earned enough for some better robes. Now she has a Devotion Set, enough crystals and "spiritshots" to keep her going, and even a little money. Considering that ten days ago she had nothing, I'm quite pleased with her progress.  Okay, then, on to other things. I've been posting on the official forums at the  urlLink Lineage II Offical Site . There are many Americans players who are not happy to have Chinese players roaming around on their servers. Almost daily someone starts a thread complaining about Chinese players and asking  urlLink NC Soft  to ban all Asian IPs. Since I live in Japan, this means they would be banning me as well. Not a good thing. In all honesty, though, that is not the part that irritates me. What really gets my goat is how xenophobic my fellow countrymen are becoming. America is the most powerful nation in the world for only one reason: they respect the desire of all people everywhere to live in freedom. Despite this, xenophobia is a problem that raises its ugly head every thirty or forty years. I am at an age now where I understand why xenophobia does far more harm than good, and I have posted dozens of messages trying to convince people that banning Asians from the North American servers will hurt the community, not help it. Naturally, almost no one believes me.  Before I set Giantina aside, I finished her level 20 job change quest. She is now officially a Scavenger. In the course of finishing that quest, an interesting thing happened, so I posted it to the Offical forums in response to yet another "let's do something about the Asians" post. Here is what I posted:  Of Farmers and Fouls  I was out in NE Elmore killing bears and collecting Honey Jars for my Scavenger Quest. There were four other dwarves running around and one light elf archer. Within minutes of my arrival, one of the dwarves SoEed back to town. One dwarf girl, armed with some kind of claw weapon, began following me around killing the bears I attacked. I asked her to stop. She killed one more, said "hehe", and went off to another area to hunt. A few minutes later she was back, but just watching. I said, "Please go away!" At that point the male dwarf character hunting nearby came and shouted, "LEAVE HER ALONE", without specifying which one of us he meant. Quite silly, really.  A short dialogue ensued where I explained why I was killing bears, explained that she was, too, and added that she was probably doing the same quest I was. As we spoke, the KSer killed two more bears than SoEed back to town. The male dwarf who believed he was helping remained convinced that the other dwarf was a "Chinese farmer" and told he had already fought her once and killed her. Note that they were both white, so she must have fought back. He then SoEed back to town, leaving me, one dwarf, and the light elf.  Are you with me so far? We've got two aggressive players who have already fought over a hunting ground, a dwarf, a light elf, and me. Here where the tale changes unexpectedly.  I go back to hunting bears. The remaining dwarf comes up to me and says, "ni hao". I tell her I don't speak Chinese. There is a pause, she says, "get honey? easy?" I tell it's not easy, but yes, I am getting honey jars. She goes over to the light elf and there's a rapid dialogue in Chinese. Pretty soon another dwarf materializes nearby (logging in I think). Both dwarves start hunting bears, with the elf helping them by taking first hit, and in some cases, last hit. However, they stay clear of the area where I am and I stay clear of the area where they are. After a bit, I go up to the elf and ask if he speaks English. He says something in Chinese, and the first dwarf comes up to me asking what I need. I tell her that if the elf keeps taking first hit, the two dwarves will never get honey jars. The elf needs to concentrate on crowd control while they finish their quest. Another Chinese dialogue, three-way this time, and they modify their hunting style.  After a bit, I finish collecting my honey jars and get on with the next leg of my quest. When I get to Tomas, who do I find but the dwarf with the claws! She was doing her quest, too. We talk, and guess what, she's Canadian and speaks perfect English. She even apologizes for stealing my kills, excusing herself by saying how frustrated she was getting because the honey jars were not added with every single kill, but only every fifth or sixth, and sometimes even worse.  The only problem I'd had was with a Canadian player that another player had already killed because he'd assumed she was Chinese. There were three Chinese players hunting that area, two of them were doing their quest and one was watching their backs. Were the three Chinese farmers? I don't know, and I don't care. That's their problem not mine. Either way, this kind of scenario unfolds around me every single time I play. Yes, there are a lot of Chinese players. For whatever reason, they don't bother me and I don't bother them. This is called "peaceful co-existence".  I understand that some players have a lot of trouble. I come onto these boards everyday (can't play the game at work, after all), and read horror story after horror story. I am 100% certain that some of these miserable stories are pure fabrications by xenophobic individuals who attack first and regret it later. How many? Again, I don't know and don't care. What to do about the true stories?   Nothing. It's that kind of game!   If a player does not like this game, this environment, and this community, then they need to exercise their rights as a consumer and move on to something else. How to solve the "farmer" problem? Find the buyers, find the sellers, ban them both. How do you find them? That's NC Soft's problem, not mine.  My suggestion to everyone is simple: don't buy adena, be nice to other players, kill the ones that don't appreciate it.
