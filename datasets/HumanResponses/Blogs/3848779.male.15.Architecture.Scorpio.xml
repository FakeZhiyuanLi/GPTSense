						   I do believe that Willard does judge Kurtz. Even though Kurtz told him not to I do believe he did judge him. He does have the right it judg him because I believe everyone is entitled to their own oppion about someone. Their oppion may change as time goes on, but people get a first impression of someone and then judges them. I'm sure Willard did judge Kurtz from what he knew and read about him. That way at least he had some idea of him. I did judge Kurtz when I first heard about him based on only what I knew. I may not have the right, but I do have the right to my own oppion of what I think of him. From what I knew I juged him as a man who has gone insane and lost his mind. My oppion of him never changed from what I saw him and read about him.

						     I think that willard has judged kurtz but really has no idea what kurtz is like and has no idea what kurtz has been through. So "NO" willard does not have the right to judge kurtz in any way because of this. He might be able to judge him based on his appearence, but as to what he is really like nobody has the right to judge him. Although the man could be completly insane he could be the nicest person in the world. Until you find out what is really going through someone's head you have no right to judge anybody.

						   While in the jungle captain Willard arrives to where Kurtz is staying. At this time in the story we come to a point in which we do not know whether or not we can or can not judge Kurtz. Can Willard judge Kurtz? Well what I have read and the darkness put around these men Willard has a right to judge Kurtz. In the storyKurtz has been in the jungle for some time now&nbsp;with cannables and tribes out to kill one another. During this time at some point he had to of known what would of been right or wrong. But then again the darkness in the story can eat your soul and you would belong to&nbsp;the jungle. So even though Willard may feel he should not judge this man he can. In my mind Willard has a right to judge what he has done and what he will do to him and to the tribes he has put himself up as a God to. In my right mind I do judge him and what he has done to people and I can honostley say that this man is crazy and he will do anything to protect himself and his people.

						   No human, by any moralistic right, can judge another human, because of the fact that they are human as well, and they are just as guilty of any sin as the person they wish to judge.&nbsp; When Kurtz tells Capt. Willard "you have the right to murder me, but you dont have the right to judge me", he was right.&nbsp; Willard, in his journey to find Kurtz, learns more about him and his past as he gets closer.&nbsp; Knowing what he does about Kurtz, I believe that Willard does indeed judge Kurtz for his actions, at least at first.&nbsp; When he finally confronts Kurtz, he begins to realize what is going on around him and is more understanding about his own mortality.&nbsp; No mortal can judge another, because of the fact that he IS mortal.&nbsp; I do not judge Kurtz for his actions.&nbsp; I dont agree with or condone&nbsp;what he's done, not by a long shot, but I do realize that I am just as capable of becoming Kurtz myself, and therefore I am not worthy of laying judgement on him.

						   Although it would seem natural for Willard to judge Kurtz in some way or another it appears to me that there is no indication of Willard doing so.&nbsp; At best it seems that Willard has a sort of respect for Kurtz's character, however there is no moral judgment in regard to his actions.&nbsp; When Chef is freaking out about the evil he is surrounded by and how insane Kurtz is Willard offers no comment, he just tells Chef what to do to help him destroy it.&nbsp; Willard does not respond to Chef by praising Kurtz either.&nbsp; Ultimately Willard never gives any sign of judgment, good or bad.&nbsp; In this regard Kurtz is portrayed not as immoral, but rather as amoral, as free from moral restraints, somehow beyond them.&nbsp; He cannot be judged because he is one of the soldiers he talks about,&nbsp;he&nbsp; acts without judgment.&nbsp;

						   Kurtz tells Captain Willard, "You have the right to murder me, but you don't have the right to judge me."&nbsp; DOES Willard judge Kurtz?&nbsp; Do you?    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   In my mind, I believe that Willard does judge Kurtz in numerous ways. One of the was in which he judges Kurtz is when he was first sent on the mission to find and kill him, Willard thought to himself why would they want to kill an officer who was one of the best there was. He thought that Kurtz might have gone crazy from being in the jungle too long and it was not safe to have him around. Kurtz was building a society which worshiped him. Another way in which Willard judges Kurtz is when he sees a bunch of dead beheaded bodies laying around and thinks why would someone do this. I also do judge Kurtz because of what he did. He was one of the best in the military but he chose to lead a group of people in Cambodia instead. He also sacrifices and beheads his own worshipers which does not go well with me. So I believe that Willard does judge Kurtz as I do.

						   To judge is to tell whether an action is wrong or right based on a concept of good and evil. In a civilized environment it's easy to judge, the rules are set and everyone knows them, but in the jungle, in the darkness, the concepts of right and wrong change. Survival seems to be the only rule, even though surviving implicates the extermination of others. Kurtz is just surviving in the jungle. We cannot judge Kurtz, for our rules of the game do not apply to him. From our point of view, he might look as a ruthless murderer, atrocious and mad. But to those who follow him, who have&nbsp;lived what he has lived, and seen what he has seen, he is a genius, a king, a god. Judgment depends on the point of view.   Captain Millard judges him at first as insane, but as he himself enters into the darkness realizes that he cannot judge, only survive. Kurtz murder is presented to us as a sacrifice because it is parallel to the ritual of the cow, a necessary sacrifice, not punishment. In a world of darkness, where all is taken away from you, the rules of the civilized cannot apply to your behavior, survival is the only priority.

						   &nbsp;&nbsp; I think captain Willard does judge Kurtz, since he finds his actions atrocious and&nbsp;ends up finishing his mission as an "errand boy" and kills him; though, before he does that, he seems to pity him a lot because he had many opportunities to kill him earlier and he did not do it, but dedicated his time to learn about Kurtz's whole ideology and to study him, which is very logical, due to this character's brilliant mind and how interesting he is. When Willard is staying in Kurtz's "temple" he makes the observation that this man&nbsp;appears to be &nbsp;more anxious that him for the killing and he seems to be asking for that favor that will give him peace; this shows us that he might not agree with this man's way of thinking but he does see him as a very troubled human being and that he understands him.  &nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to me judging Kurtz, I guess I automatically do judge him, because I&nbsp;do not find&nbsp;beheadings and sacrifices pleasant or&nbsp;justified, but when I think about it I really can not judge him, because he is in an environment that strips his mind of all prejudices, ethics, and rules, except for the necessity to survive in a world where survival of the fittest is the only law. Kurtz acts like a god in front of this natives and does what he think is right, and, in the end, it is right because he is surviving where most men perish. I think Marlow is extremely right when he says that we can not understand his situation from where we are, so the only way to realize that we can not judge Kurtz is by putting ourselves in his place and forgetting all that has been taught to us in the civilized world.

						   i think that the most similerity of the story and the movie is the setting. And also in the story its sais that"he sees&nbsp;piles of decayng machinary and a cliff being blasted for no apperent reason." The same is happening in the movie. The soldiers blew up a village just to go surfing.&nbsp; An other similairy is Kurts in the movie.&nbsp; the jungle made him go crazy.

						   There is a similarity in the movie with the book. In both of them there is a Mr. Kurts that the main character has to go see. Also, everyone thinks that Mr. Kurts is a great man. This is important because it is what the story is really based on. Finding this man Kurts. Hunting him down and doing the assignment they are given to follow. Also, finding out things about Kurts along the way. As in the book and the movie there are many stops along the way to finding Kurts. This is an important similarity because both the book and the movie are focused on finding Kurts.

						   &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The biggest similarity that I see between the movie and the book is the similarity of Kurtz and Marlow losing&nbsp;their minds. In the book they lose&nbsp;their minds because he has been away from real civilization for such a long time. The captain in the movie also loses his mind because he is away from the civilization that he was used to. For the unknown reason the two men lose thier minds and they start to take over "godlike" qualities such as debating what to do with peoples lives. In the book it was the African Americans and in the movie it was the Vietnamies.

						   &nbsp; In what&nbsp;I have seen so far of the movie, the most important similarity that it has had&nbsp;with the book "Heart of Darkness" is the part when the captain says: "When you are out there, you want to go back home; but when you get home, the only thing you can think of is going back to the jungle" just at the beggining. It reminds me of the fascination for the detestable, the attraction for the abomination that Marlow describes in the book when he narrates his experience in Africa.It is&nbsp;a sight so hateful, so detestable that the person strangely feels strongly attracted to it and ends up losing his mind.

						   Apart from the obvious similarity of the setting I think one of the most important similarities so far is what is encountered along the river.&nbsp; In both  Heart of Darkness  and Apocalypse now the actions of the people on and along the river are absurd.&nbsp; The absurd actions in both works include waterskiing in a war zone, attacking a nonexistent enemy with a warship, capturing a village for the sake of surfing, and blowing up a cliff just because it's there.&nbsp; Though the absurdities in the two works are very different they create a similar feeling.

						     The main similarity I found between  Apocalypse Now  and  Heart of Darkness  is the characters and the missions they are assigned to. In the book, it is Captain Marlow is assigned to employ Kurtz but in the movie its a little different. The captains name is Willard and he is sent on a mission to kill Kurtz. Also, the setting is somewhat both different and the same. It is different because it takes places in two different countries, Viet-nam and Africa. The settings are the same in the sense that they are both dark and have a sad feeling to them.

						   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The similarity I saw between the two, is the tone. The tone is dark in the movie as well as in the book. In the opening scene in the move the lighting is poor and everything is dark and hard to see. In the book, comrad uses dark terminology, like gloomy, and dark.&nbsp;I think that the director wanted to reflect this in the movie by using dark lighting as often as possible. He wanted to stay true to the books purpose.

						   The most relevant similarity that I saw is the effect of "the jungle" on people's minds. Kurtz was an excellent officer, the best of the best, and suddenly seems to have lost his mind. His words on the tape make him look completely insane. He his wanted for murder, because he executed supposed double agents,took things in his own hands, "played God".   Another example is the regular officer that shot himself not too long ago, that though they don't say why, shows that there &nbsp;is definitely something that makes people mad. The same happens on "Heart of Darkness", when Marlow is told of a man who hung himself, and when he asks why, the response is : "Who knows! The sun too much for him, or the country perhaps."

						   The most important simalarity in Conrad's Heart of Darkness and the movie at this point is mostly between in my view is the main character and other obvious things. In the movie Apocalypse Now the setting is in the Vietnam war. In the story it is not placed here but the stories are alike in another way other than this. In the movie the main character and the main character in the story in the Heart of Darkness are the same. Marlow and the special opps, General Fuller have a order or a job to do, to find something. They may be some what different but they both have the same drive to find what is going on in the jungle. The Thames River and that both of the men are meeting at this place. Also obviously that it is placed in a jungle. The setting is has the evil, dark, place to it. But these are the similarities that I have seen between the movie and the story so far.

						    Thus far in the movie  Apocalypse Now , it is somewhat easy to see the similarities between the movie and the book  Heart of Darkness , on which it is based.&nbsp; In the beginning, you meet the main character, Cap. Willard, who in the book is represented as captain Marlow.&nbsp; Both of these characters are sent on basically the same mission,&nbsp;(Marlow is sent by a business Manager that employed Kurtz, and Cap. Willard who is sent by the military to assassinate&nbsp;Kurtz)&nbsp;to go after the same person; Kurtz (a character in the book, as well as the movie), and it for very similar reasons.&nbsp; These similarities are key to the story, both in the book and the movie, because it establishes the long and dangerous&nbsp;journey that Marlow and&nbsp;Cap. Willard must go through in order to find&nbsp;Kurtz, who is hidden deep into the tretcherus jungles of&nbsp;Africa/Vietnam.

						   The Thames river plays a role in British history. In the story the Thames river had important people such as Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Franklin. They all traveled on  the Thames river but there is something else that is important about this river in British history. There were people who had traveled on the Thames river through to passage and then never came back. So there is something or someone keeping people from passing.

						   Charlotte Mann								7/16/04 Blog				Heart of Darkness  	The Thames River played a big role in British history. It has served many different types of people through out the ages. For many different reason such as conquest, power, war, treasure, fame, and fortune. It has known many a great man knights with titles and knights with out titles. Known every ship that sailed out of her ports, all the ships that came back, and the ones that did not. It served a great many purpose to all men and ships that have sailed on that river. It has served captions, admirals, and generals. The Thames River is famous and well knows by all who sail on it.

						   &nbsp;I believe that the Thames river, more that just part of the scenery, is a symbol of the beginning of great adventures or challenges. Many famous persons had commenced their journeys here, one of them Sir Frances Drake on "the Golden Hind", or Sir John Franklin. I think that the author is saying that, as those famous adventurers,&nbsp;the protagonists&nbsp;who will be part of the story are also in the Thames river, going for their own journey ahead.   With the river's description, Conrad introduces the reader to the story, and prepares him for what is coming.

						   Joseph Conrad gives a very important significance to the Thames river, in "Heart of Darkness", for having known and helped "all the men of whom the nation was proud, from Sir Francis Drake to Sir John Franklin" (page 8), in their way to battle,&nbsp;conquest, exploration&nbsp;and in their return home. It had borne "the dreams of men, the seed of commonwealths, the germs of empires" (page 8). The author describes the river with a solemn air of respect which makes us, the readers, realize its importance in British history. As we read the story, we start understanding what was happening inside the minds of all of the sailors who were in the eve of a great adventure.

						               in the story the river is said to be the pathway for manny people in britsh history, the river was traveld by those who seek fourtne or by those who seek fme. it is litterd with the dreams of men, and the hopes of manny. this is the profound effect that overcomes the people on the yacht, the history engraved in the watter and the manny people who travled before them.

						   In Heart of Darkness, the setting of the story takes place on an ancient river known as the thames river.  It it holds a historical significance, for it is the home of many battles between men, and has served many captins of fleets that the nation is proud of, such as Sir Francis Drake, to Sir John Franklin; the knight s of the sea.  Also, the river is known for taking in ships that set out on some fantastic voyage or conquest, and never returned.  Different fleets would sail this river, such as the commisioned "Generals" of the east Indian Fleets, and ships full of settlers, or ship that hold kings and royalty.  Hungers for gold, fame, an th her thrill of the journey would set sail on this river, and never come back.  ooooo, scary.

						   In heart of a darness the significense of the Thames river is that it is a symbol of life and the history around  it. The river has memmories: meaning that it holds memmories of British history. The river has always been there, it is the origin of what happens. If the river could talk, it will tell the stories, the history of the battlesthat had happend there. It holds the mystories and people who had died doring these battles. it is the significants of the past and pride for the nation of  the peope.

						   The Thames's role in in British is history is as the mouth from which all British conquest passed.  The narrator lists sir Francis Drake and sir John Franklin as some of the "men of whom the nation is proud" (8).  He explains that all the ships heading out to the rest of the world passed through there.  The narrator describes the river's role as one of service to the people that live at its banks.  Primarily the narrator gets really poetic about the greatness of he Thames because all British conquest and imperialism extended from its mouth and flowed along its currents.  The narrator places great value on the river's role in the history of what he calls the greatest town on earth and admires the river greatly for it.

						   thames plays a very important role in the heart of darkness. Many ships had departured from this river with important people like Sir Francis Drake and Sir john Franklin  to fight for their country, o find a new colony, hunting for gold, there were two other ships that departured from this river in search of the northwest passage and never returned.

						   There is a fair amount of description of the Thames River in the beginning of Heart of Darkness.&nbsp; What role does the Thames play in British history?    The Thames sea was described as being welded together with the sea and the sky. It was also described very eerily and dark. This was a very busy river where many ships took off from. The Thames river played a main role in the road of trade. But many ships that took off never found its was back to the landing site. "What greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown earth?...The dreams of men, the seed of commonwealths, the germs of empires." (8) I think this means that everyone who rafted down the Thames river had a part of them taken away.

						   The discribtion contributes to the story by giving it feeling and an image to the reading so he or she can better understand what is happening. An axemple is when tony describes how you die from thirst. This allready tells you how durante is going to die.  And at the end the discribtion that tony gives happens to durante in the desert. And the writter doesn't say that he dies. Only discribtion is used.The last sentance of the story is what gives it away that he is dead. The discribtion makes you understand that durante is that.

						   July 8, 2004-Blog #2  How does description (especially of setting) contribute to meaning in this story?  The description of Durante and the overall setting greatly contribute to the meaning of the story because. The setting shows a tough time that Durante had faced and how rugged it was. Also, the author really makes a point of how dry it was in that desert by telling us about how people died when they are dehydrated.   The description of Durante contributed to the story because it portrayed what kind of person he was and what he would do to get out of bad situations he had created for himself. When he shot the water tanks, it showed us that he didnt care much about anyone else, but only for himself. The consequence for this wrong-doing was Tony giving Durante a canteen of wine, instead of water. When Durante took his first big sip of this fluid, he realized it was wine and became angry and already knew that he was going to die in the desert like his father.

						   The detailed description of the desert in Wine on the Desert was key to establishing a certain symbolism.  The desert is, for lack of a better word, merciless.              Durante's journey through the desert was described as a hellish experience, where he is beginning to suffer hallucinations.  When he came upon Tony's property, it was like finding a safe haven in the midts of hell.  The house represents sanctuary from the rest of the world (that being the desert), which is trying to kill him.  The author described Durante as being so happy to even see the windmill that it looked like a sacred item to him.  Just seeing the containers of water made his body break out in a sweat.  For Durante, just being fortunate enough to see this haven in the middle of the desert was like a holy man who finally reached Heaven after trying so hard to get there in the first place.

						   The discribtion contributes to meaning in this story by giving it a feeling, it helps to create a image for the reader. That makes it easier to understand what is going on. For exampl on page 105 you can read that when you die of thirst you only die one way. In this paragraph, this discribtion tells you how he's going to die. The discribtion is what forms the story.It helps you understand the story.

						       The description of the setting in Wine on the Desert contributes greatly to the story.  First it gives the story the classic western feel, but more importantly it establishes the two different places in the story, Tony's house and the desert.       Tony's house is life.  At the entrance the vines at the door are healthy and have white blossoms. The windmill is described as a sacred emblem.  While Durante is there the sky is described as beautiful.  Everything from the outside and from the desert is dark and ominous.  The air, from outside, is dry. After a little while there is no more blue sky. Eventually the desert cuts of his vision of the blue mountains, the only other thing described positively.  In this manner the description is very important to the meaning of the story because it really sets the difference between the desert and the havens of tony's house and the blue mountains.

						   When the passaangers were all exchangeding their thoghts and sorrows in their contest of pitty, the ones who spoke out all had one thing in common: their sons were ALIVE, fighting on the front line in the war.  This could have stirred something inside the fat man, making im pitch his two cents.  The fat man broke down simply because of this: His only son was dead.  As he depicted his feelings for his only child lost to war, he was full of pride, and would even laugh to lighten the mood, or perhaps his own.  To him, he made his so-n a living memory.  So much so, that it could have made him deluded, torn beteween fantasy and reality; believing his son to still be alive even when he knows his son is dead.  The fat woman's question, ignorant and insensative as it was, served as a wake up call to the fat man.  When he heard her question, it made him realize that his son was indeed, dead.  Not alive even in memory, but dead, gone forever.

						   The fat ma broke down becauseof what the woman asked him.If his son is dead. He had every feeling bottled up inside. And because of everyone talking about the subject and fighting stupidly who deserved more has more pity.The fat man's son was already dead and he created this fantesy world so he wouldn't feel bad. And while he was talking, more feelings keep adding up inside and he's holding it with everything he has not to burst. bringss back memmoeries.At one point you will eventually brake. He realized that his so was really gone and not coming back ever, when the woman asked him. and when you brake with all that he has boddled inside, that's the worst thing that you can experience.

						   The fat man has an emotional breakdown at the end of the story because the woman asks him if his son was really dead. Her question really affects him because he finally realizes that he willl never get to see, talk or play with his son ever again. At first the man did not realize how it had changed his life but, when the lady said it to him, he finally recieved the full impact/ sugnificance of what has changed in his life.

						   In my opinion the fat man's mental break down was caused by an unwilling aceptance of reality. his son was killed in war and he blanketed his emotions with ramblings of his love for his country, and tales of heroisim. the woman's simple question forced him out of this state and in the horrid reality. is son was dead and he had to accept it.                her question was so effective in making him realise that his son was dead.

						   The man's breakdown is the result of his innability to hide behind his rational explanation for being happy that his son died happy.   Even as he explains why he is not mourning the narrator describes him as bulging and as having inner violence.  no matter what he says it is clear all is not well with him.  As hard as he tries there is no way for him to pretend that his son's death does not phase him.   When the lady finally asks him, not about the circumstance of the sons death or how he feels abut it, but wether his son is really dead or not, the man can no longer contain his feelings and it all comes out.  It seems to me that the way the question is asked, if he is dead or not, forces the man to meet the facts head on and in that situation he can no longer hide from his emotions.

						   The account that makes the fat man breakdown is the women asked him if his son was really dead. That is when it hits the man that his son is never comong back. He is really dead and gone.  The woman's question affected his so much because, she may have been the only person who asked him if his son was dead. The question got the fat man thinking about his son and that he really is dead.

						   When riding on the train and talking of heir sons being sen to the front and complaining , the fat man had to explain to them that they should atleast be happy to have them serving their country and know that everything would be fine. But then when the woman asks "is your son really dead" the fat man had to htnk or know that his son was really gone and that he would never see hin again. And he had asuch a strong emotion in telling the story of his son and the things that he had felt. while he was wayand finally relizing he would never meet with him again caused his breakdown while talkng to these passengers on the train. Why the woman's question " Then...is your son really dead" affects him. His son probably recetly and he, being stil emotional broke down. And with all of these emotions inside him and the way he looks tells you that he is very emotional already and is bout to burst any ways.

						   July 8, 2004-Blog Assignment #1  The fat man states that they should consider their childrens feelings whenever, even if they love their country. But the child has to die happy in order for the father to be satisfied. Then the woman suddenly stated, "then...is your son really dead?" She made everyone think about that statement. This made the old man realize that his son is gone and is never going to come home. The kid is dead and the man weeps then realized that he is really gone. Those weeps soon turned into sobs which saddened everyone in the room.

						   In this story, how can you account for the old man's sudden breakdown at the end?  Why does the mother's question affect him so powerfully?
