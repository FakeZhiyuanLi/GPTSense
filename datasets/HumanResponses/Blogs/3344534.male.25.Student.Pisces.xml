      of course i procrastinated this entire weekend.  i've got too much to read and too much to write in too little time.  the first summer session ends in three and a half weeks... and then i go right into the last session.  the flames lost tonight... but they put up quite a battle... one goal was the difference between a 3-1 series lead and a 2-2 series tie.  maybe they'll win on thur in tampa... and win the series back home for game 6.  lots of people are supposedly coming home for july 4th weekend... i'm pretty excited about that.  hmmm... what else... i'm ready for  urlLink anchorman  to come out.  will ferrell is such a funny person... he goes all out and over the top... how can you not laugh?   urlLink the incredibles  should be funny too.  i think i'll plan on a trip to new york in august after chem's over with.  i'll be able to stay a bit longer this time... maybe a week or so.  so my linux drive in my linux box died... i can't recover the files that are on it.  it took my beos install with it.  i put in a spare drive, and want to run solaris x86 on it just for fun.  the install wouldn't let me get into the x-win portion of the install.  so... i'm going to recheck the requirements... and if that doesn't work... it's back to linux i guess.  anyone know what the advantages of reiserfs over ext3 are?  or reiserfs over any other file systems are?  all my guesses have been wrong so far... but the list is definitely shortened.  who are you mystery person?  when i find out... i will get you back =].  ok... i seriously have to read now... maybe get through more than 10 pages every 3 hours or so.

       urlLink this  story... here's a quote that needs to get out there.   "But then, suddenly, Hull beats Hasek, the red light goes on, they rush the Cup out to mid-ice for a fast presentation and then everyone runs for the bus. Everyone except Kelley. He's looking at replays. There's a foot in the crease. This should not count. This is not right. Buffalo's getting cheated!" now that call was BS... and you KNOW it too bettman.

      the flames dismantled the lighting 3-0.  the pace was fast and the game was physical, but it didn't break down quite like game 2 did.  just seeing the crowd on tv... it was really something.  they're just so excited... i think all of canada... is just excited that one of their teams is back in the finals.  it is kinda nice to see a team like calgary in it... one that just goes out and works hard and scraps for everything.  i'm not saying that the lighting don't deserve to be in the final... they ARE a good team... but they have a couple big name people whereas the only "star" the flames had at the start of the season was inginla.  calgary is a classic team of role-players who've meshed together very nicely.  i mean you gotta love a team that rolls 4 lines and 3 pairings of defense.  you also have to love a coach who plays his third pair d-men against a line of the top three offensive skaters of the opposing team... sutter certainly has got some balls.  another thing i enjoy about playoff hockey in the US... barry melrose (hockey mullet and all).  melrose never be don cherry... like espn/abc hockey coverage will never be cbc's hockey night in canada... but i think he's a really good and insightful analyst.  so i went to the iroquis national wildlife refuge.  i highly recommend it.  i did some walking on their trails and i saw some eagles... it was pretty amazing.  unfortunately i couldn't find the digital camera... so i took my normal camera... which refused to work at some points.  i did get some pictures of them off in the distance and in flight *fingers crossed*.  hopefully they'll came out and i'll be able to scan and post them somewhere.  i think i'm gonna sleep now... but before i sign off... i wanna give a shout out to cmh.  nightenED!

      vietnam deja vu?  a  urlLink group  in canada is lobbying the government in ottawa to grant refugee status to US soldiers opposed to fighting the war in iraq.  in the present they are directed at two soldiers who arrived in canada after serving in afghanistan and then were called up to serve in iraq.  both soldiers objected to the reasons the US had for going into iraq and instead slipped into canada.  i do hope (and i think they will) allow US soldiers refugee status.  canada's good like that... they'll come through.  here's a  urlLink link  about stem cell research from t.c.  it's a pretty thought out article.  i found it quite interesting.  at times i struggle with when life actually begins... i'm kinda going back and forth on the issue.  i am pro-choice to the extent that i think it is a person's decision to decide (much like with any decision)... though my personal feelings are that abortion is bad.  cali is the first state to  urlLink regulate  wireless service.  it could be good... it could be bad.  it's a fine line for government to get involved in regulating industries.  some industries do need to be watched... especially ones where complaints are frequent.  however... sometimes government holds on for too long which also hurts development and emergence of new technologies.  it'll probably be a good thing in the short run, happier customers probably.  so i helped leng move today... and then i came home to pack stuff for jon.  he's so lucky... i already bought all the stuff that he needs... he doesn't even have to lug anything home.  now if i move to an apartment... i'll need to buy everything all over again.  so i met emily and ellany... who leng moved in with.  ellany is 6 months old... and she's so cute.  she's got the cutest smile... and she likes to bounce.  we went to carmine's for dinner... and she was jumping on my lap for awhile... and she has ittle hands and ittle feet... and cheeks... and an ittle nose.  tomorrow i'm planning on going to the  urlLink iroquis national wildlife refuge  if i can get up early enough.  i need to go make observations or something for a paper for my bio class... it's such a freshman thing to do... i feel stupid doing it.  hopefully it'll be interesting though... maybe i'll forget that i need to do a paper and actually just enjoy being out there.  leng and jay mentioned a possible trip to toronto this weekend... hopefully i'll get enough reading done so i can go... if they decide to go.  it's been awhile since i've been up there.  hmmmm... so... here's an article about the cup finals and how the flames and lightning are developing a  urlLink distaste  for each other.  nothing like hockey to stir up the emotions.  i hope the flames develop a home-rink advantage in this series as they haven't been doing well in the playoffs in calgary.  three fun links for you... the first two brought to you by tansal... and the third by leng. - urlLink exorcist in 30 secs with bunnies  - urlLink shining in 30 secs with bunnies  - urlLink super mario reloaded   and to the person who sent me the "so what you suck" card... gimme another clue... i still have no clue who you are.  ok... i'm delirious... g'nite.

      you know... people are  urlLink dumb .  yeah... no crap if your diet consists of high-fat meat as an appetizer, followed by a meat entree, sandwiched in between a meat dessert (want a meat shake with that?), your blood will become thicker than crude oil or bush's skull.  Jody Gorran of Delray Beach said he believes the Atkins diet books and products should contain a warning label that one-third of the population is at risk for developing health problems when they eat meats and other foods endorsed by the diet that are high in saturated fat. what a total douche... did he really NEED a label?  does ANYONE need a label?  sit your fat ass down mr. gorran... and don't waste the people of florida's money by taking this to court.  speaking of food...  urlLink this  is one of those weird things where you wonder if it'll work.  $50 is a pretty big incentive... if you're outta work and you're up in new hampshire if this bill goes through... just drive around and start reporting people.  the question i ask though... how much parenting of parents should the government do?  a couple get togethers for their children's friends shouldn't be punished... at least they're supervised.  and more food... i don't really like  urlLink krispy kreme  all that much... i'm more of a  urlLink tim hortons  kinda guy.  anyways... LOW SUGAR DOUGHNUT?  what's a low carb doughnut?!  a doughnut is a giant thing of carb if you haven't yet noticed... that's preposterous... that's ridiculous... why would you want to take away the yummy goodness like that?  pretty soon we won't be able to eat anything... cause everything will be bad... we'll be left chewing on celery ("fat abbott... you need to looooose weight").  one last food  urlLink link ... damn... i feel like jody gorran.  so using the internet to buy groceries is expanding... unfortunetely for me... i never got to try  urlLink fresh direct  cause i think they didn't deliver to brooklyn until i was about to move or something.  i do remember getting food through priceline though... that was pretty cool... made grocery shopping on a college student's budget in manhattan a lot nicer.  too bad that service got shut down.  i also remember kozmo... i miss kozmo... they didn't have groceries... but they did bring snacky munchy stuff and movies =]... with their cool orange kozmo bags.  there's one thing in nyc you can develop really quickly... an attachment to your food guys.  there's my bagel cart guy on 14th and university... kumar @ the waverly diner... dolip @ the food emporium @ union sq... the chicken man up in murray hill... and the pizza guys @ mercato... it sure has been a long time.  go  urlLink flames  GO!  Surely there's a lad somewhere in Tampa, Fla., residing in a home with a broken air conditioner, who thinks that playing in the National Hockey League would, quite literally, be a cool thing to do.  Conversely, there are thousands of boys throughout Western New York for whom making it to the NHL is a 24-hour, 365-day obsession. They skate on frozen creeks and ponds or take their game to the streets, time and again scoring the goal or making the save that engraves their names on the Stanley Cup. To them, there's no worse feeling than being cut from the travel team, because being cut from the travel team usually means becoming a doctor, a lawyer, or a sportswriter.   There are a dozen legitimate reasons to root for the Tampa Bay Lightning over the Calgary Flames in these finals. And there's one overwhelming reason to root against them. Buffalo has never won a Stanley Cup, and it'll be a slap shot to the naked shins if the contrived hockey town of Tampa wins one first.  this is an old link from last week... about how hastert  urlLink lectured  mccain on military service and sacrifice.  i just thought it was funny given that he was directing it towards mccain... who served in vietnam and was a pow.  john mccain is one of only a couple people that identify with the republican party that i truly admire.  not much else to say about the article... just thought it was funny... not in a "ha-ha" way... more in an "oh... ummm... riiight" way.  my friend tina sent  urlLink this  to me awhile ago too.  it's michael berg writing about his son nick who was murdered a couple weeks ago in iraq.  i hope everyone in the bush administration read every word of it.  i hope everyone that wants this occupation to continue with no changes in the structure of our organization  have read this.  how can we at this point with everything that's gone wrong not realize that we're not doing things correctly?  how many more people do we have to give reasons to hate us?  how many is enough mr. rumsfeld?  10,000?  90,000?  500,000?  if this keeps up, it'll be far more than that.  we really need to let other countries in to at least defuse and mediate the situation a bit.  we have no credibility... how are we going to stabalize a country that doesn't trust us?  gotta stop hoarding that oil and let people help... it's not ours anyways.  interesting article on  urlLink convergence  and the possibility of deregulation of the telecommunications industry.  eventually i think deregulation would be beneficial... but i think we have to wait a bit for these converged technologies to develop.  i do think though, for the present, we need to provide a level playing field for the telcos as they're going up against deregulated cable.  if one industry dies out, it will not only affect our economy... but an entire infrastructure that's been built out already will be wasted.  hopefully the telcos will catch up... verizon has big  urlLink plans , but i'm not at all confident that they'll be able to acheive their goals to the satisfaction of their  urlLink customers .  in other telecom  urlLink news ... at&t is jumping back into wireless after at&t wireless was acquired by cingular.  doesn't say a lot for the division you spun off that bears your name if you wanted to get back into wireless but didn't want to just reacquire the division.  it's unfortunate qualcomm wants licensing fees for their cdma technology (which in my opinion has features that are better than gsm)... cause that limits people willing to use it.  if you have a gsm phone, you can pretty much use it anywhere in the world (most of the world's cell phones are gsm)... all you need to do is buy a sim card in the country that you're in.  why does this country LOVE to do things back assward?  the world health organization makes me laugh... especially after seeing ben and jeff do their bit... even though the  urlLink stories  involving the organization aren't funny... the headlines are... cause they're always questions... about someone... hehehehehe... eh... shyuddup.  WHO Confirms 19 Cases of Ebola in Southern Sudan  this  urlLink here  is pretty cool... it's so interesting that you can go around and dig and find things that were "lost".  the university's pretty big... i guess they took their edu-macation seriously.  and i guess some of you whiteys were right... you ARE  urlLink losing the country .  yup... we're gonna take your women and children.  this is intersting... perhaps i'll use this article for my sociology paper.  i wouldn't have guessed that immigrants would've lived longer on average given how supposedly medicine in the US is "better" and more advanced than other countries.  the difference isn't too much, though they didn't say what the life expectancy of immigrants were... i'd have at least thought it'd be lower or the same for someone moving into the US from another country.  ah... all caught up... now i can clear out a bunch of links that i've saved and was just keeping so i could write about em.  anyone have any interesting plans for the long weekend?

      done with bio lab til next wed.  so as i mentioned before my parents are going to the city to move some stuff into jon's new place.  unfortunetely for me... i have a book to read and 2 papers to write.  this would've been a good weekend to go to the city too... i'd have been able to leave thur afternoon and get back mon.  oh well.  i'm not going to be escaping the moving though... i'm helping leng move on friday.  i hope it's sunny and good weather... so when i'm done with all my work i can hang out and play.  i still don't know who sent me that e-card.  frickin jerk.  i hate bio essays... there's too much to know... we don't have multiple-choice tests... sucks for me.    Nostalgia ,  Cracker        And here's Ivanovich       in his rocket ship       Spinning helplessly       up above the earth        While his heart is splintered,       All the girls of winter       are buried in their coats anonymous        While winter girls are waiting,       Ivanovich in high rotation       is just another star       up in the sky.        And while the world was waiting,       We're overwhelmed by some sensation       of something long ago and far away        Like General Jackson's arm       it's buried on some farm       While the fever       pushes words from his lips        And by the drunken river       where the soldiers shiver       We rest beneath the shade of the trees        While winter girls are saying       each of us a tiny nation,       You're just another star       but so am I.        And while the world was waiting       We're overwhelmed by some sensation       of something long ago and far away

      passed on by my friend bern... full of poems and goodness (title of post is link... me likes blogspot!).  i'd recommend checking out the ones by Pablo Neruda.  here's one that i immediately liked by Richard Brautigan... kinda playful and light.    It's Raining in Love   I don't know what it is, but I distrust myself when I start to like a girl    a lot.  It makes me nervous. I don't say the right things or perhaps I start    to examine,               evaluate,                        compute    what I am saying.  If I say, "Do you think it's going to rain?" and she says, "I don't know," I start thinking:  Does she really like me?  In other words I get a little creepy.  A friend of mine once said, "It's twenty times better to be friends    with someone than it is to be in love with them."  I think he's right and besides, it's raining somewhere, progamming flowers and keeping snails happy.    That's all taken care of.                BUT if a girl likes me a lot and starts getting real nervous and suddenly begins asking me funny questions and looks sad if I give the wrong answers and she says things like, "Do you think it's going to rain?" and I say, "It beats me," and she says, "Oh," and looks a little sad at the clear blue California sky, I think: Thank God, it's you, baby, this time    instead of me.   i hope to be back in a bit... gotta plow through some bio first.

      so... i really don't know who sent  urlLink this .  i have a couple guesses... but it could be a number of people... not too many clues that would point out who exactly it is... especially cause it could be people i haven't talked to in a long time.  so... if you're reading this and it's you... and i haven't guessed if it's you yet after a couple weeks.  frickin send me a normal email... cause this is gonna bother me =p.  oh... and for those of you just dropping in... check out the  urlLink site .  it's got some really funny cards.  and i know i didn't update like i planned on this weekend... eh... oh well.  maybe this weekend.  my parents are going to nyc to move some stuff into my bro's (jon) apt.  i need to go to some wildlife refuge and make observations for bio class or something.  more studying... lates!

      so today was my first day of class for the first summer session.  i'm taking evolutionary bio (my stupid ap credit from 8 years ago doesn't count for some programs cause it's been too long).  so my prof is a total dick too.  he's one of those guys who's always got his panties in a bunch.  it's gonna be a tough class... just like ap in high school, but worse cause the prof is a bitch.  the class itself is full of people who are retaking the course cause they messed up during the normal school year... so lots of immature brats from long island who are just annoying.  my soc class is gonna be pretty cool though.  the prof did part of his education @ the new school.  since it's a summer class, there's only 6 weeks of classes... he decided to take the topic of new york city immigration and use that as a basis for topics in sociology instead of going through a whole intro course from a textbook in 6 week.  i like doing applications of topic so much more... it makes dry subjects more interesting.  the only downside of soc... lots of reading and a couple papers.  i haven't done either in awhile.  i walked home today after classes... it was so nice... 70 degrees... blue skies.  took the bike path and cut through the some office parks and back onto the path in walton woods in audubon.  i need to find a good bike... preferably used and in good shape... i'm gonna start riding again.  big happenings in the buffalo entertainment scene for the summer.  i'll have to get into details later.  here're some cool sites about history, preservation, commentary, and development of buffalo that i've been reading up on lately.   urlLink Preservation Coalition of Erie County   urlLink Downtown Buffalo 2002   urlLink The Shrinking City   onto a  urlLink subject  that'll probably interest more of you than my shameless buffalo promotion.  i certainly hope that people our age are starting to wake up and start taking responsibility.  we need to stand up and fight our current leaders and take the power back.  we can change things... but first we need to put people that will listen into office.  i really hope america wakes up and really sees how tragic this all is.  people are DYING!  we need to build international consensus and put in a multinational force so we have a system of checks and balances.  if we impose it on our own government between the judicial, executive, and legislative brances so no one branch has all the power, why did we not use it when we went in and stayed in iraq?  we need to encourage dialogue... cause as long as there is talking, there is hope for less violence.  we need to mobilize  urlLink against bush .  finally... before i head off to bed... this  urlLink article  is just good.  the flames are up 3 games to 2... they just need to finish off the sharks... just win one on frickin home ice already!

      mom's been out talking to lots of people.  my dad told me tonight that he and my mom are most likely going to go up to toronto this coming weekend and stop by niagara-on-the-lake.  i guess when my mom went up to niagara-on-the-lake yesterday with a couple of her friends she met some girl who worked in one of the art stores or something and somehow became best friends with her... and my mom told my dad the girl was "very beautiful."  or something to that extent.  so now... she's suggesting that i go along cause she thinks this girl wants to meet me?  i don't know how the hell that happened.  now normally... i think it'd be cool to meet a girl who was canadian and is going to u toronto for her masters... who is cute, hot, whatever.  being canadian gets automatic bonus points in my book.  still though... i'm not so down with the parental hookup that's just blatantly obvious... and lately... i don't know what the hell it is... but the pressure is seriously on.  not just for me mind you... jon as well... every other frickin day... i hear them talking about jon and scheming with the other asian parents.  it's terrible.  perhaps not living at home i was in the dark... and maybe they were always like this... but even still... the pressure has been relentless lately... especially since there've been people... old friends of my parents visiting the area... and the gossip has been flying around... you know... the "who's married" conversation, the "who's a doctor" conversation, and the "who is running a multinational company" conversation... i'd say the standard asian back and forth between parents.  only now it seems to be really focused on the "who's married" topic.  i'll be out at lunch... with these people... and i'll try to be as quiet as possible... i'll let them do their talking catch up etc.  all of a sudden... and this only takes one person... "jason (or ren san-mandarin or yun san-cantonese)... i want to introduce you to... ".  it's at that point that i give a little smile and try to transition to another topic... but it's already too late.  everyone joins in... and i just listen... and it goes on for a good 45 minutes at least.  ok... maybe... and hopefully it won't come to this... if i were like 36 years old... and i was in danger of becoming a true dirty old man... then... maybe help would be ok.  but i think the cut off is at the least like 33.  i don't even know what i'm doing with my life yet... everything's contingent on if i get into a pharm program right now... and if that doesn't happen... well... i don't know.  if i can't rely on myself... how is anyone else going to rely on me?  we'd be done in about 10 minutes.  of course... if you want to be my sugar mamma... the position's still open!  ok enough with that.  new news... good news for the most part.  i bought 2 new hard drives... 8 meg cache... totally makes a difference.  i was able to pull off some data from my dysfunctional hard disks.  i got back dreamweaver mx and flash mx which i had desperately needed for a possible web design job... and i got back some mp3s... and my most current palm data (i had not synced in awhile and the batteries ran out to my palm).  it's not total good news... cause i think for the most part i've lost all my south park stuff... and i'd say 70% of my mp3s.  the method i used to recover was interesting.  you stick the hard disk in the freezer for 2 hours or more (wrap it in an anti-static bag and put that in a ziploc)... have your new hard drive handy... take out your frozen drive... and transfer you old stuff over to your new one.  this method only works if your drive's read heads are damaged.  sometimes through use, the heads end up expanding from the heat over time.  when you freeze the drives... it shrinks the heads back to a size that they can function at again... though it will only be functional for a short period of time.  this method worked great for 2 of my drives.  i was able to keep these 2 up for 30 mintes... enough time to transfer the contents of my old c drive, and my /var/httpd, /home/jchow directories, and some misc linux config files on my linux disk.  my third disk full of mp3s and iso solaris files, odd todd cartoons, and south park seasons did not fare as well.  so that was disappointing... since this was the disk with the most info.  oh well...  now i must sleep.  petition coming soon... promise.  night.

      it was brought to my attention by my good friend kristi and co-softee afficionado late last night that there's a campaign to silence mister softee in new york.   urlLink nytimes story    A couple of weeks ago, Mister Softee became the cream-cephalic public enemy for the Bloomberg administration's proposed crackdown on unwanted noise. Along with boomboxes and barking dogs, city elders seemed concerned about protracted exposure to the jingle emanating from the 250 Mister Softee ice cream trucks that lumber through the streets of New York. that's totally ridiculous!  wtf is THAT?!  you can't just tell mister softee to shut up like that!  it's preposterous!  i am outraged!  i am angry!  i'm not going to take it from the man anymore!  THE MAN MUST GO DOWN!  the one main reason that mister softee should NOT be silenced is... because of the jingle, you can tell the difference between softee and a softee imposter.  there are trucks out there that are painted the same colors as an official softee truck... they are tricky like that.  without the classy tune... you might run down the street chasing one of these imposters and when you finally catch up... find out that you had been had by a fake!  with the song however, you can rest assured that you are getting the real thing.  on the flip side... with the softee song, you KNOW when he's in your neighborhood... and you can run around the streets (as i have done on many occasions) trying to track him down.  so... not only does the jingle signal the beginning of summer... but it serves as a public benefit for those in search of this TASTY BITCH.  besides... half the fun is trying to track him down.  in response to this attack on my good warm weather friend mister softee... i am going to create a petition and submit it to the bloomberg administration.  i am going to ask for the support of all softee lovers past and present who have bought from a mister softee truck in new york city.  please check back here in the next week or so, as i want to get the right wording, grammar, spelling, etc., down before i put it up on petitiononline.  thanks for your prompt attention to this matter.  we must resist!  btw... did you notice in the upper right hand corner of the nytimes link it says... "printer-friendly format sponsered by"?  i clicked on the printer-friendly format for the article... cause it's easier to read.  but even printer-friendly formats have sponsers now apparently.  anyone find that at least a little disturbing?

      spot coffee is so good.  i just got back from spot with kate.  she's in town for the weekend for a wedding.  last time i went to caffe espresso... i didn't see the mochachino shake on the menu.  i found my replacement though... spot has the mocha shake... which is just as good... though it doesn't come in the nice large glass that espresso uses.  does it bother anyone else or is it only me that the political & religious right is pushing this defensive marriage act as an amendment to the consitution?  i think before they can push it to bar gays from getting married... they need to examine their own marriages first.  if you're going to defend marriage... wouldn't you think you'd try to work out your own marriages instead of getting divorced... or cheating on your spouses (newt, rush, the list goes on).  it's kind of hypocritical to say that you want to defend marriage when you're not even practicing the idea that marriage is a so called "sacred" union between a man and woman.  i'll bet you some of these gay or lesbian marriages last longer than hetero marriages.  this issue i guess is up to the people to decide... but i personally do not think that we should futz around with the consitution.  besides, marriage is a personal decision, much like religion.  you cannot force someone to believe what you believe.  i'm so sick of the right using religion as a cover for everything.  church and state SHOULD be seperate.  again... it's a personal decision to follow rules of any religion, we have something good here, freedom to choose, don't allow these people to take that away.  i think God works in different ways... when you're ready to see him, he'll show up and change you and circumstances around you in ways you never thought possible.  it won't happen unless you're ready and willing though... so it's very personal, which is why no matter what law(s) we make aside from the basic laws that we all adhere to cross cultures, i don't think they'll do any good in the end.  laws don't change people's minds, they just end up complicating things and cause more distrust, dislike, and hatred between groups of people... which we can surely do without.  i'm also tired of feeling like christians have to be pro these actions... and i'm tired of people thinking that all christians are pro these actions.  so i guess being me is just bad on both fronts.  it doesn't matter anyways... in the end it's not up to me to know what's right and wrong and what happens when people die.  i'm just gonna do my thing the best i can... and try to live my life according to God's will.  well... i'm gonna sleep.  i start the next summer session tomorrow.  chem frickin 2... woo hoo! (not really).  ben folds & guster this saturday!  out!

      today was my last day of bio... final went ok... lab practical was impossible.  i'm just glad it's done... coming into today... i was doing pretty well... hopefully the final and practical haven't changed my standing much in the class downward curve-wise too much.  i should be in good condition if that's the case.  yesterday was our last bio lab... i had to take apart a pigeon... it was pretty nasty.  i hate pigeons... nothing worse than a nyc pigeon with greasy feathers and a mean streak.  i think the whole plucking feathers thing was the worst part... with the skin and fat ripping off.  you had to be careful not to pop open the crop... lest you want barley covered in preservatives and pigeon juice on you.  i've done rats and sharks before... the pigeon is probably the hardest in terms of chordates since they don't have a nice lateral line.  you have to cut through the curved muscular breast area and that's pretty hard if you don't want to damage the internal organs.  anyways... that's over now... i'm happy.  on to chem 2 next week... i hope i don't get a crapload of work for the long weekend.  no articles just a bit too spaced out right now.  das ist alles.

      marlon (the one that runs with the monkeys) sent this  urlLink story  to me.  it's quite a long pdf document, but it's worth reading.  i find it funny... it's an actual account of a scammy scammer getting reversed scammed by the scammee.  i'm just looking forward til thur... i'm not doing quite as bad as i thought in bio even after that last test.  hope i don't totally mess up the final.  i'll have a free weekend with nothing hanging over my head finally... and then i start up again next week (ugh).  however... lots of people are coming to buffalo for the 4th... we got the ben folds concert and all.  bern's brother greg decided to bail on nyc... so bern's heading here.   urlLink tc's  coming, and hopefully kris will have time to meet up, if only for an hour and a half... i must take her to get some real wings (yes... it's THAT important.  you cannot just come here and be all not getting wings).  and i found out yesterday that jon got into suny downstate med school.  my parents are thinking about going down to see him on the 4th... but i'll have to wait til august when my classes are done.

      caught a showing of dodgeball last night with some friends.  it's a total stupid funny movie.  if you like stupid funny like me, go see it... it's an all around fun movie... put you in a good mood.  ben stiller is always good as the bumbling idiot type... but in this movie he's a total dick.  vince vaughn on the otherhand isn't the d-bag... and he does a good job with it.  sometimes his parts go a little overboard when he's being that real annoying guy in other movies (ie. "made") and it just distracts you from the good parts of those movies (at least for me)... but he plays this part really well.  if you're one of those people that looks down on these movies, have no sense of humor, and never laughs or doesn't enjoy laughing... don't go see this movie.  but DO frickin lighten up a little jeez!  nothing worse than people that can't laugh at things and give D's to these kinds of movies in their reviews.  who says movies have be serious all the time?  laughter is GOOD!

      courtesy of  urlLink josh ... says here rochester was holding some festival where the organizers were giving free beer if you register to vote.  i guess the event is over... sorry i got the link late otherwise if any of you buffalo peeps really wanted to spend the 50 min driving to rochester for 2 oz. or beer you could.   ”It’s just a fun way to get young people interested in voting,” Clifford said. uhhh... if you watch tv, read the news, are struggling with finding a job, sick of the government spending YOUR money on illegitimate wars, sick of this administration hiding behind and using religion as justification for their actions, tired of things like the patriot act tax cuts for the top 1% income earners while shifting the fiscal responsibility to the rest of the nation... and you DON'T want to kick these a-holes out by making sure you vote... i don't know what to say to you... just make sure you don't tell me you're one of those people cause if i run into you, i may well house your ass.  here be a post by  urlLink tansal  regarding music (classical, popular), and how in certain situations you can just tell how a performance is on a completely different level... interesting cause i've experienced it.  ok... hopefully this will be my last hockey post for awhile... some of you are sick of my hockey rantins.  hasek is a selfish self-centered  urlLink bitch , and iginla  urlLink rocks  out hardcore.   urlLink this  cracked me up.  there are some real d-bags out there... steam rolling a kid for a stupid baseball.  good job buddy.  there needs to be a consolidation of wireless networking standards and frickin flash memory.  it's getting  urlLink ridiculous , throw out the bad standards and develop the good ones.  nowadays you have to buy things like 50 times cause standards aren't interoperable.  speaking of which... i'm trying to decide if i want to go with lg or samsung for my new phone.  the lg has a better screen something crazy like 200k colors vs. the 65k for samsung, but the samsung is lighter and smaller with better battery life and future video capability with future firmware update (so i've read).  the thing with the new verizon phones i don't like is they're trying to phase out AMPS 800 on their network (analog signal), so the new phones don't come with it in them... they're only true CDMA phones.  since the AMPS signal reaches almost everywhere in the US it's a good backup to have.  eh.

      so i broke out "twice removed" today.  it's been awhile since i've really listened to it and just not used it at background music.  i forgot how good the album is.    Bells On , Sloan  While I'm at this funeral  You're in New York  I've been dividing my grieving  You're sleeping with a mutual friend   I dreamed that I kissed your mouth  And you thought about me  Over Christmas  Oh, you might know who I am  But I know who you are  Your heart is in your art  And mine's in New York   I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve  You're sleeping with a mutual friend  And I want to be with you again  And again  And again  I've thought about you a lot lately  So flash me your metal smile   I'm thinking about you  You're thinking about  New York  Though to you your friend was hurt  To him I owe him money  Will you pay back the thirty dollars  That he thinks I owe him?  But I don't owe him anything   If you had a funeral  I'd be there with bells on  La la la la la...   If I had a funeral  Would you even care?  Would you wear your silver dress?  Would you actually wear lipstick?  Would you lie upon my grave?  And be there with bells on  So you could ring me from this life?  From this life  From this life  So you could ring me from this life  people of the sky  is i think one of the few andrew songs that's on my favs list... and it's on this album.  as sloan has progressed... i think andrew songs have become more wordy and annoying.  hey... aug 7th @ 1pm... sloan playing "hot august night" concert on olympic island in toronto with a couple other bands.  $40.50 CDN includes ferry ride over to the toronto islands from the harbourfront.  ok i'm out.

      when i was small and my brother jon was smaller we were eating watermelon and he swallowed a seed.  i told him a watermelon would grow in his stomach.  his eyes opened up really big and he said, "really?" all worried.  then i got in semi-trouble for making stuff up to him.  that just popped into my head while i was eating watermelon.

      i think i am the king of buying malfunctioning computer hardware.  so my hard disk is officially dead.  it was only 2 years old and the warranty expired already!  there's only a slight chance that i will be able to recover the data by unorthodox methods, i need to get a new hard drive in order to try it.  if i was a millionare i'd send it in... but professional data recovery will usually cost $1000+ for one disk, and it's only at most 30-40 gig of info composed of mp3s, crackz, and appz.  even still, all the stuff that i've built up for the last 4-5 years will be gone if i can't get it back during my last effort to recover it.  the only positive... my documents and financial stuff is all on my other drive and backed up onto other media.  i can't believe a 100 gig drive from western digital would die that fast.  i guess i'm not gonna go back to wd.  my list of hard drive manufacturers that i trust and can vouch for is slowly going down the tubes.  the only one that has made it back on my list is maxtor after their purchase of quantum's hard disk unit.  even with that purchase though, i still can't bring myself to completely vouch for maxtor based on past experiences.  so... seagate you're the only one left... don't f*ck me.

      it's making some awfully weird sounds... and as i type this entry on another computer... mine's still in the process of booting... and has been for some time.  there seems to be some disk activity... i can hear it... hopefully it's windows recovering something as i had to hit the power button to shut it down last cause the disk locked up.  i should've bought a new computer when i still had a job.  now... i'm @ a "no $ = no toys" stage in my life again... for what?!  so i can take some natural science courses?!  who's idea was this career changing thing anyways!  eh.  stupid computers.

      ok... i guess in the end this will be good for hockey... the hard part is maintaining interest.  classic example... US soccer.  it got huge in 94 when the men's team did fairly well... but died back down.  same with women's soccer... all hyped up for the world cup... then not much of a splash otherwise.  i guess i just don't see hockey as a sport that will take hold in warmer climates.  you can still be outside playing football in february weather with shorts on in florida if you wanted (well... us buffalo kids could at least).  not only are there climate barriers to establishing a healthy market... but hockey is thus far an expensive sport.  equipment for a defensemen or offensemen can easily start out around $500 a player... and for goalies?  forget it.  see... it makes sense for us northerners to invest... since winter's long... it's the only other team sport besides basketball that's going on.  elsewhere in the south, you're still playing outside... you still have a multitude of choices on what you want to do with your time.  eh... so in conclusion... fine... the cup goes south to a new market.  hopefully it won't be for nothing... hopefully there won't be a letdown like what happened with the florida panthers... but jeez... couldn't it have been a little further north?  carolina?  even atlanta... i would've accepted that... at least they used to have a team in the nhl before the thrashers.  so i got an email from straphangers which is a nypirg awhile back.  they are in the process if they haven't already of attempting to restrict camera use in the subways (flat out banning it).  the subway experience is a rite of passage for any newcomer or tourist.  you SHOULD be able to take pictures for yourself, family, whomever.  on top of that... there are so many interesting things to take pictures of while you're underground.  some of the ads that've been drawn and written over depicting new movies coming out etc are totally classy and classic.  i remember this one on where it was promoting the movie blue crush in the lorimer station on the L line.  someone drew a penis and scrotum coming out of the bikini... the blonde haired girl was missing teef and her eyes were all messed up.  some dialogue was written on it... i've forgotten what it said... but all i can remember is looking at the picture and cracking up... wishing i had brought my camera.  anyways... here's the email i got... join the pirg if you want and live in nyc... tell the mta you understand they're trying to make things safe... but you don't want to be in complete lockdown everywhere you go (which is where it seems we are headed patriot act version 2 anyone?).   Dear rider:   The MTA is now accepting comments on its proposal to ban photographs, film and video in the subway and bus system.  We strongly urge you to express your views by commenting at:  http://www.mta.info/nyct/rules/proposed.htm (The option for sending an e-mail to the MTA can be found at the bottom of the MTA's description of its proposals.  Don't be discouraged by the MTA's confusing e-mail form.)   For information and arguments against the ban, you can visit: http://www.straphangers.org/photoban/  ============================== NYPIRG Straphangers Campaign One Click to a Better Commute - http://www.straphangers.org obviously he would say  urlLink this .  he's the head of a multinational energy company dependent on non renewable energy sources as his profit.  can you imagine what would happen if the solar economy had an advance and developed overnight?  there would be no way to transition a company like exxon-mobil.  they're too big and they've invested too much in their infrastructure.  think of all the billions of dollars they've spent on industrial equipment and distribution network!  energy independence will need to be reached at some point if we're going to continue to use fossil fuels as our main energy source.  fossil fuels will run out... then what?  we might as well start now... and i think we should concentrate on it a lot more than we are... trying to develop more efficient ways of using renewable energy.  the quicker we find something that works... the less oil we will use and the less environmental damage we will cause.  that has to be worth far more than any pain we incur in the short term.  it's sad that the cost of higher education is getting more  urlLink expensive .  now with the economy still down from it's late 90's peak (yes a couple thousand jobs were created recently... but remember how bush went out to reclassify mcdonalds jobs as manufacturing jobs?  we can't solely rely on numbers as they're almost always skewed to benefit the administration that releases those statistics) states are cutting their education budgets putting more of a burden on students.  i've always felt that education is one of the only places where your race and your background don't define you... well... it's turning out to be less and less true.  if things progress as they are now, higher education will be out of reach for many people if they aren't already.  pretty sad for a country that is supposedly the "land of opportunity".  education has always been the easiest way for anyone to get ahead.  if you know more than the next person you're hired for a job.  that's how it usually goes at least.  whether you experience discrimination in the job place is a different issue... but during your time in school... once you get into a school... i would argue that anything other than school work is not a determining factor in how you do... thus i think it's an equal playing field for all.  it would be a shame if in the future we have less tremendously bright students limited in how they can pay for education to be the factor that keeps them out of a college or university.  as with individuals... having a population that is educated is the easiest way of keeping our own country in good shape.  it may be our only defense when china really comes online and its economy wakes up when it leverages it's 2 billion plus people.  so... the point is... education... important... we must make it more accessible instead of making it prohibitive.  and here's some  urlLink funny  (also ridiculous you decide what proportion it is to you).  what's this with renaming all the airports?  the OC?  what the hell is that?  i mean... i thought the george bush intercontinental airport, and ronald reagan national airport was bad (reagan was a charming guy and all... i'd have loved to have had him as a grandad or something... but i thought his economic policy, defense spending, and budget control were terrible!  i mean... it took us 3 presidential terms after he left to get out of the hole we were in... and since have gotten back in thanks to dubya).  now seeing how airports are just being renamed for people that haven't done phenomenal things... naming an airport after a stupid tv show is just well... stupid!  can you see why other countries laugh at us?  see how ridiculous we are?  for an elected official to even bring it up?  it just makes me mad... and that's a problem for me... cause i feel like dark helmet in spaceballs... but instead of being surrounded by a-holes... i feel like i'm surrounded by dumbasses.  being mad isn't healthy... so they say... and i get mad everyday multiple times... i'll probably have a heart attack and die when i'm 30... i'll just get so mad i'll spontaeneously combust from the anger at stupidity inside of me.  ever watch lewis black?  i think that's going to be me when i'm older!  i've also been visiting this  urlLink site  which i've heard about but recently visited.  it's pretty damn cool (content AND style wise).  here's something he  urlLink published  about the death of the q diamond train in new york.  i wish i was there... it sounded fun.  if it was only a week later on my bday... i could've made a trip for the weekend.  reading the site and short fiction stories posted made me think back to stories that i told so i wrote a one drawing from my own format.  you ever notice that when you first become close/attracted to a girl and you're younger (though it still might happen when you're older but it's less frequent i think)... your friendship/relationship develops to the point where they want you to tell them a story?  of course you oblige and try and be cute about it cause you wanna get action or continue playing the game or whatever.  well... it's happend on a couple occasions... and you start out with "once upon a time there was a boy and a girl..."  well most of my friends will tell you that i like messing with people... not because i'm mean... but mostly to see their reactions to things said or done.  anyways... my stories would always follow a certain format... mostly as a joke and to see if the person was paying attention and throw them off a bit.  i guess i'll post it below this post so you get the explanation first before you read the story... it might make more sense with an explanation of what i find funny than if you'd just read the story (maybe not).  the thing that happens at the end... would always happen at the end of all my stories.  the details given in the beginning are crucial to draw the person in... make them connect somehow... i'll leave it at that.  g'night!

      Larry looked around the room and noticed the numerous posters of stamps clinging to the walls covered with faded paint.  Looking down at the floor, he let his eyes wander a bit before focusing on two exquisitely shaped feet in light blue flip-flops.  They looked like they had been recently washed, not having the dust or soot that envelope most toes exposed to a humid summer day in the city.  As he was about to shift his attention he noticed that the woman was stretching her toes out and relaxing them.  Larry smiled a bit as he thought how strange it was that someone would randomly be stretching their toes; then again he thought, not many people would take notice of these insignificant happenings in life.  He looked up at the woman and saw that she was happily talking on her cell phone.  Larry wondered if the woman knew what her toes were doing while she was conversing.  The bell sounded and the number 11 started to blink.  Larry quickly walked over to window 11.  "Can I have one stamp?” Larry asked as he flashed a smile.  "Sure, that'll be thirty-seven cents.” replied the postal worker returning the smile.  As Larry put his change on the counter with one hand he picked up the stamp with his other.  "Thanks so much.” said Larry.  As Larry was about to turn around and walk away, the postal worker pulled out an AK-47 attack rifle and shot Larry.  Larry died instantly.  The End

      i finally checked out the chapel's sunday service.  it's pretty cool... i may make some more visits.  bettman need to go... they need to review their review policies in the nhl.   urlLink this  is getting ridiculous.   Know goal? The NHL apparently doesn't  By BUCKY GLEASON   6/6/2004      C ALGARY - Hey, Calgary, we in Buffalo feel your pain. We, too, are familiar with phantom goals, or in your case, one that should have counted but never did and wasn't adequately reviewed. Now, it's off to Game Seven with the league getting saddled with yet another controversy in the Stanley Cup finals.  We need not rehash Brett Hull's foot in the crease in the 1999 finals that handed the Stanley Cup to the Dallas Stars. At least that one was open to debate, a judgment call that didn't go the Sabres' way. And of course there was the six-hole in Philly in 2000.   This one could turn out to be a bigger mess because Oleg Saprykin should have been awarded a goal that would have handed the Stanley Cup to the Calgary Flames, rather than forcing them and the Tampa Bay Lightning to travel across the continent and settle things Monday.   History will claim Martin St. Louis' goal 33 seconds into the second overtime gave the Lightning a 3-2 victory in Game Six on Saturday night in the Pengrowth Saddledome, forcing a seventh game in the St. Pete Times Forum on Monday. Calgary should have won the game much sooner, setting up the biggest celebration since the Flames won the Cup in 1989.   ABC replays showed Saprykin scored with just less than seven minutes remaining in regulation after charging past two defensemen and sending a shot into the crease. Nikolai Khabibulin tried kicking it away, but the puck squirted under him and crossed the goal line. Of course, it wasn't reviewed. The Flames became another victim in a league known for making serial mistakes at the worst times.   And they wonder why people say this league is a joke.   Fans were chanting, "We want the Cup!" in both overtimes.   Folks, you should have had the Cup. How would you like to be Rhett Warrener, the former Sabres defenseman who was twice a victim. He said going into the series that No Goal was still wrenching his stomach. Now he gets more acid.   The good news was Calgary has another chance, even thought it shouldn't need one. There are few things better in sports than Game Seven, especially in hockey. You think these two teams have been going at each other now? Wait until Monday night. And make sure you're rested. Overtime is expected, if not encouraged.   The Lightning were lucky. They thought they had things under control when Brad Richards scored on the power play from behind the goal line. Everybody knows what happens when Richards scores. The Lightning wins. They're 30-0-2 this season, 8-0 in the playoffs, when he finds the back of the net. And he did it twice.   Apparently, the Lightning win when Saprykin scores, too.   The Lightning's confidence skyrocketed through the saddle-shaped roof when Richards again on the PP later in the period. Certainly, given the previous statistics, the series was certainly headed back to Tampa with the winner hoisting the Cup, no? Well, it doesn't happen quite so easily against the Flames.   They never, and I mean never, give up.   The Flames have been down several times throughout the series, and they were trailing twice Saturday night, but they tied the game both times to set up a nail-biting, heart-pumping third period and 20 minutes, 33 seconds of overtime.   Chris Clark popped one in from the doorstep after Ville Nieminen's blind, spinning feed bounced off Stephane Yelle's stick and landed on Clark's. Marcus Nilson's was even easier after Saprykin weaved through two defenseman and handed Nilson a gimme.   Monday will be a fitting, if not necessary, ending.   It has been a fantastic series, and Game Six was better than Game Five, which was better than Game Four. The hockey gods figured the league will be shutting down next season, so why not extend this one? It's seems the only way to decide a series in which two teams couldn't be better matched if the league called Dial-A-Date.   The best-of-seven series for Lord Stanley's trophy was billed as a battle between Tampa Bay's speed and skill and Calgary's rough and tumble, pretty against punishing. What we've learned over the six games is that the Lightning's toughness was underrated, and so was the Flames' talent. Together, they treated fans to the best series in years.   Now it comes down to one game.   Yes, we get more.   The finals aren't usually a test of hockey so much as a test of survival. Look down the list of Cup winners over the years, and you'll see one team overpowering another, a string of four straight sweeps in the '90s, a necklace of anticlimactic finishes. This year, we watched two teams push each other to exhaustion and beg for more.   The series already had everything. Great goals. Big hits. Breakaways. Cheap shots. Overtime. A suspension. It had a fight between two of the game's best players in Jarome Iginla and Vincent Lecavalier. It had a match of wits between two porky coaches, Calgary's Darryl Sutter and Tortorella. It had short-handed goals and incredible defense, odd-man rushes and unbelievable goaltending.   Iginla and Martin St. Louis, two finalists for the Hart Trophy given to the most valuable player in the regular season, went head-to-head with the same level of play. Iginla positioned himself for the Conn Smythe Trophy by dominating in Calgary's first three victories. St. Louis countered with a goal in Game One, scored a big goal in a victory in Game Two and tied Game Five with another.   The Flames and Bolts crammed more into six games than some teams do into 60. Now it's 82 games and four rounds of the playoffs crammed into one.   And another major blunder threatening to corrupt the finals.

      =[, calgary just lost game 6.  30 some seconds into the third overtime.  monday's the big day... they HAVE to pull through.  their record on the road gives hope... but it'll be hard getting over this letdown... when it was so close.  refocus guys... win one for canada and true hockey lovers!  the panthers won a cup already... we can't have one team from florida winning one when minnesota, buffalo, vancouver haven't won one yet.  1999 reared its ugly head again.  they were showing a stat about guys who won the cup in overtime for their teams the last couple years.  the name brett hull came up... and the year 1999 came up... and i wanted to punch someone.  skate... crease... as cartman would say... screw you guys... i'm going home.  night.

      so here's the music breakdown so far for the interesting concerts this summer.  i'll start off with something i can't make but you new yorkers should try and get to.  i know this is short notice and all... but the buffalo philharmonic is playing @ carnegie hall tomorrow and sunday.  concert's @ 2pm both days i think.  the saturday concert has balcony  urlLink tix  left for $5 last time i checked, the sunday concert has the more difficult pieces so it's more expensive.  i'd recommend the saturday concert if you can get to it.  i would love to go and see 2 of my private lesson teachers play in new york on the caregie hall stage!  look for douglas cone and andrea blanchard-cone.  both of them sit in the first violin section, they are the nicest people ever, and are super good violinists.  next weekend and the weekend after is the  urlLink roycroft chamber music fest  in east aurora.  the festival was started by my first real private lesson teacher nancy gaub and her husband eugene awhile ago before they moved to teach at grinell college in iowa.  they still run it every year though.  i haven't seen them in years and years... i think i'm gonna make a surprise visit.  i learned took lessons from mrs. gaub for a really long time... and during that time is when i learned the hardest material.  i think before she had moved... we were talking about me starting on the bruch violin concerto... and maybe even the tchaikovsky violin concerto... which if you've never heard either of them... you really should.  the bruch is one of the most exciting concertos i've ever heard... and the tchaikovsky is perhaps the most well rounded and difficult i think because it takes so much emotion to play it and it is a physically grueling piece.  oh yeah... if anyone's interested in going... let me know... i'll even cover for tix for the first person to respond.  then on jul 3rd, ben folds and guster are playing @ niagara square... FREE frickin concert!  on jul 4th, the goo goo dolls are playing @ niagara square... another FREE concert!  now i'm not so big into the dolls' new stuff... but they rock out buffalo.  i'm tellin ya... it's gonna be a good show.  plus... they haven't released the sched for the US side of the friendship fest (FREE) that buffalo has every year with fort erie during which we celebrate our respective country's independence days.  kim mitchell's playing in fort erie on the 4th... i feel bad for her to have to go up against the goo goo dolls.  mainly cause she's a really good and established musician.  then for the one i've been waiting for for the longest... spirit of the west is playing on jul 15th for the thursday @ the square concert series @ lafayette square.  they're gonna pack in the square and we're gonna have a jolly old time.  oh and it's FREE!  we also have blue rodeo with universal honey opening up for thur @ the sq on jul 1st, and the juliet dagger who i'm just starting to get into on sept 2nd.  plus the buffalo phil has got some concerts @ artpark in jul this summer... and we've got shakespeare in delaware park (FREE)... a multitude of art, ethnic, and food fests going on... this is gonna be a great summer.  just what i needed... i've been missing out on this for 6 years.  the only other thing i could possibly want... maybe they'll get the low to play the marina again!  ok... i'm gonna go... send good vibes if you've got any... i'll need them for the rest of the first summer session classes.  and new york crew... i shouldn't even have to give you reasons to visit me (haha!), but if ben folds, guster, and the dolls can't convince you... and or spirit of the west can't convince you... well... i might as well just disown all of you!  GO FLAMES!!!

      i've been waiting for a long time for a true hockey TEAM (ie not full of stars and with and unlimited budget) from a city where it actually gets below 32 degrees F (0 degrees C) in the winter to win the cup.  the flames need just one more game saturday in calgary... and they'll bring the cup back up to canada.  it sure has been a long time.  tonights game was intense... calgary was the better team for most of the game.  they didn't do as well in the third period, but came back strong against a determined lighting team in ot.  jerome inginla had another brilliant game, and yet again, someone who hasn't reached the scoring sheet in some time (saprykin) stepped up with the sudden death goal.  both goalies made some gorgeous saves but unfortunately for khabibulin a spectacular game for him ended in defeat.  game 6 should be fun to watch with so much on the line for all of the great white north.  i'm sure the calgary bench realizes it, so it'll hopefully give them extra incentive... hit a little harder, skate a little faster, play their grind-it-out transition style and wear down the lightning's game of pure speed.  nothing quite like the smell of ice in may.

      cause you can't really do problems and see if you know it.  you can do that with chem and physics... bio is probably the most easy to initially process... but you just have to have a good memory in order to do well.  bio's kinda like a science that's more social science almost in how much you have to memorize.  i think my brain is full... at least it seems that way.  eh... so here's a post on the message boards on  urlLink orkut  that i got.  I am writing a kernel module for Linux kernel 2.6. I am currently dynamically allocating memory in the kernel module using the "kmalloc" function call. I am basically DYNAMICALLY creating an array of structures in the kernel module. I then plan to fill this array of structures with data and export it to the user space. I tried using the "do_mmap" function to map the kernel virtual address to the user virtual address. However it fails i.e when I try accessing this memory region in the userspace I get a segmentation fault. Can someone please enlighten me about how do I map the memory area dynamically allocated in the kernel space to the user space. the person wrote to the linux community on orkut... i thought it was pretty cool... i still like how orkut gives people a more professional outlet instead of being only social like the other networks out there.   urlLink this  is pretty interesting.  i wonder if elected officials and powerbrokers in buffalo have read this.  we seriously just need to get our crap together and clean house.  there's still too many people who think we're in the 1960s and 1970s around here.  our city is dying... we have to find a way to keep young people here, otherwise we'll keep on going the way of hartford, ct. becoming a shell of a city.  i think it's quite interesting how marketing and branding has increased its scope to emcompass cities and places.  it's not just for toothpastes and products anymore.  you have to play towards the people you're trying to attract.  "They come here for the architecture, history and gritty atmosphere."  if you market that to the right people, they will come.  it's the same reason why there was a migration to the village, to the east village, to chelsea, and onto astoria/lic, williamsburg/greenpoint, and dumbo in nyc.  if you catch the attention of enough people to attract a critical mass, people will move and bring with them income which can revitalize neighborhoods.  of course, this happens in hyper-time in new york since there's already so many people in the region who are always looking for cheaper rents.  the markets can't adjust as quick so that smart (re)development takes place and in many cases it destroys the feel and character of some neighborhoods.  it can cause great distress for families that've been in a certain area for awhile.  rents can go up as landlords exploit their resources namely the housing stock, which at times leads to established families having to look for housing elsewhere.  in a sense this is and advantage for cities in the northeast and around the great lakes.  since there isn't quite the demand for space, if they have a good plan to implement for growth, and they have a progressive government, they can grow smartly and at a slower pace.  i think growth pace is important, you need to grow steadily and fast enough to attract people, but slow enough so you can resolve any problems before taking on some more.  it helps to have a master plan, a vision, so at least work can be done to achieve a certain goal.  this is something that is still being hammered out here, there's some semblence of heading in a direction, but there's still a little too much fragmentation in the grand scheme of things.  hopefully that'll continue.  secure your  urlLink networks !  especially you new yorkers!  i mean it's cool and all that you provide free access to your neighbors and all... but... it's probably more trouble than it's worth to keep your network open.  spend a couple minutes reading the manual and enable wep or better yet wep and mac address ip matching.  last but not least...  urlLink tc  sent this to me.  a  urlLink post  on craigslist that was funny.  i don't think i'd go out of my way and complain about gettin some from someone normal... it's hard enough finding someone normal uhhh... normally?  i guess if you are looking to find weirdos through an alternative route though...... =].  ja... das ist alles.

      set free from it, to swim into vastness and blend into breaking waves but keep from bending cause i bleed as you do  there are times when so much, built up, pent up, rise up with a tiny spark and sudden POW! and all is calm again, clock's reset levels return to normal  been awhile since "normal" in fact... months, years, lifetimes at least it feels, in time warps of secret thoughts that surface though i might see an unrecognizable face in the mirror only to realize it's just myself  just what is it you are looking for? &nbsp;&nbsp;what's being whispered in your ear? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can i use your answers? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cause i have none of my own.

      so... how can we get pissed @ enron, arthur andersen, worldcom, adelphia, global crossing, etc., when our own government does something like  urlLink this ?  what is that?  so these large corporate companies get cleaned out, folded up, and liquidated.  in these cases the execs all get canned, as they all deserve it... shouldn't that principle carry over for government entities too?  bush, and his administration all need to go.  it's his people running the show in iraq, and it's OUR tax dollars that are being wasted and no one's being held accountable.  where's the enron level outrage of the american public now?  how can people still percieve bush to be doing a good job?  granted, he does not make all the decisions, but he chooses to surround himself with some bad to worse people.  those advisors were his choice, and they are ultimately his responsibility.  there have been too many screw ups, and no plan prepared for anything.  not only do we need someone in office that can plan ahead, we also need someone in office that can say nuclear, cause it's quite embarrassing that our president can't speak "american" correctly.  this guy needs to  urlLink relax .  it's just a bunch of balloons.  in the grand scheme of things... more or less balloons at the convention aren't going to be the issue that gets kerry elected.  i mean... c'mon... you're mr. balloon... i think you're taking your job a little too seriously.  nicholas cage is a  urlLink dirty dirty man .  he's almost as dirty as someone i know, who shall remain nameless (ok nic cage is really more dirty... but the person in question shall still remain nameless).  solaris install is going slow... i keep having to redo it... but it's coming along.  it's been awhile since i've navigated around the solaris enviro.  after that... it's onto fedora core 2.  so i was thinking last night as i was taking a break from studying @ around 11ish.  at that moment... i really missed sitting with linds, br, kris, mara, and whoever else in our living room in brooklyn and watching the daily show with jon stewart.  it was pretty much a nightly ritual... during the week.  good times.

      speaking of petitions, i had found this  urlLink petition  linked from tien mao's little red book  urlLink blog .  it was started by tom mauser, who lost a son in the columbine high school shootings.  apparently the ban against assault weapons expires at the end of this summer.  the petition will support an extension of the ban, and hopefully get congress to act before the ban expires in a few weeks.  yes, it's more serious than softee... i urge everyone to sign.

      mr. cool just passed by my house.  while he is not as good as softee... i have to say though... getting ice cream from a truck is great.  i don't know what it is... cause it's definitely cheaper to go to the supermarket and buy a pint of whatever... but just going up to a thing that's mobile and buying food is 20 times better.  kinda like getting a hot dog from a hot dog vendor in manhattan.  speaking of softee... i'm disappointed in the lack of support for softee from new york people on my petition... you guys are dicks (said in the canadian south park way).  so i burned fedora core 2 and freebsd 4.10 onto some cds... gonna try and install one or the other... or both  onto my retrofitted linux box by next week.  solaris 10 is out i think... but right now... it's only released for the sparc arch not x86.  oh yeah... so... the last post i made yesterday was what was messing up the formatting of the blog.  for some reason there were extra div tags... but i still see some extra unended tags in my template.  they don't seem to be affecting how the page comes out though.  i may have to play around with them some more... even though everything's ok hanging tags bother me... they're like unfinished business.  i finished redoing that site i was working on.  here's the finished  urlLink product .  i still am not so fond of it... but the site owner just wanted to update the site to text from  urlLink this .  it doesn't matter... in the end i guess... as long as they're happy with it... and i get paid... it's all good.  if any of you are looking for translators or anything... give em a call.  i hope  urlLink this  becomes more of the norm.  some of the hours that people work are nuts... and these are people that have families.  some single people in new york have even worse schedules... literally insane the hours some people keep.  everyone's interested in  urlLink ken .  he can earn a years salary in a day spending less than 30 minutes "working".  simply amazing.  i wonder how the taxes work on winnings from game shows?  are they taxed like winnings from the lottery?  or gambling?  i think jeopardy is more work like... there's not a large amount of chance involved... and you really do need to know your stuff.  chem... then sleep.

      wtf's going on here?&nbsp; this is the 2nd time blogger... or something/someone has added extra code to my template messing up the css in the source.  you'll have to excuse the appearance of the blog... until i can go through and find what's up.&nbsp; i've removed anything extra that i had added... as it's easier to sort through code that way... hopefully things will be back to normal by tomorrow night.

      i just checked out the low  urlLink site , turns out they're playing in buffalo the day before i get back from new york... which kinda sucks... seeing that i missed them last summer as the show was canceled because of a huge rainstorm.&nbsp; oh well... i'm gonna need to head to canada in september to pick up their new album.   if i have time this fall with my class sched and all... i'm going to join an adult hockey league.&nbsp; i guess there's a league that brings you through a developmental process... which i need... cause i haven't really played in about 9 years (maybe more).&nbsp; i miss the game though... a lot.&nbsp; only about $300 for 18 weeks of hockey.&nbsp; that's $16.67/week for ice time.&nbsp; vs. $600 or so for a 14 week season @ chelsea piers in new york.&nbsp; hopefully i'll have time... i've definitely not been excercising as of late... i need to get more activity going.   so... i think that's it... i don't have much to say tonight.&nbsp; i think i'm developing a mental block or something.&nbsp; i better go to bed or study.      Consequence,   The Notwist    You're the colour, you're the movement and the spin.  Could it stay with me the whole day long.  Fail with consequence, lose with elequence and smile.  I'm not in this movie I'm not in this song.  Never leave me paralyzed, love.  Leave me hypnotized, love.

      i'm tired now... and i'm sick of chem... but i really need to just suck it up and buckle down on it this next week and a half.&nbsp; only 2 labs left... thank God... i don't know if i can handle messing&nbsp;up some more reactions.&nbsp; here's what i found out about summer science classes... pro: short sessions, some students don't care... cause it's summer.&nbsp; which can lower the curve.&nbsp; con: short sessions, some students really care... cause they want to get ahead.&nbsp; which can totally f*ck up the curve.&nbsp; too bad for me... i think the latter is more true nowadays... there seem to be people who are really bright in the classes... but not enough dumbasses to lower the bar enough.&nbsp; what happened to the days when summer school was for people that flunked classes the first time?&nbsp; so instead of telling our young people to be persistant and keep trying... we're telling them to give up and do something else.&nbsp; which i guess has its benefits... but... it probably kills some dreams.  as it is though... it's definitely tough to balance one's dream of ideal&nbsp;with practicality... i'm skewed towards the prior... i always have been... but... i find myself fearful of going towards the ideal... cause i fear failure.&nbsp; so... now that i brought that up... i'm gonna stop... cause it's 1:30am and i need to go to bed soon... so i can't get into another long post... perhaps i'll revisit this subject at a later date.&nbsp; yes, i'm a basket-case.  ummm... oh... i had recieved a comment on an observation/question about me living in the present.&nbsp; i thought about that a bit... i can see that... but i spend a lot looking back too... and reflecting.&nbsp; i think though, me living in the present is kinda different than other people.&nbsp; other people like to do things... they like action.&nbsp; their present is a race against time.&nbsp; i kinda like to embrace the time... enjoy it like a fine wine, or gourmet dessert or something.&nbsp; i'm more of an observer than a doer (though i like to do stuff too).&nbsp; i like doing things like sitting&nbsp;in washington square park and watch little kids and babies waddle around on the grass, sparrows hop, or squirrels find seeds and nuts to eat.&nbsp; i like the quiet places... where there are few people around... and you feel like you own the place.&nbsp; new york during a snowstorm @ 4am... the south street seaport @ sunrise... the smell of leaves on a hiking trail in the fall... standing still for a moment...  ok... sleep.

      so today's my mom's bday... she's on the first leg of her asia trip... visiting some of her old friends out in LA.&nbsp; i feel bad that i haven't been able to spend time with her on the "important days" of the year... her bday... and i took a trip down to nyc on mother's day... of course she said she didn't mind... and i think she had a good time up in toronto with a bunch of other people... but still... i feel like an awful son sometimes.&nbsp; not just in regards to my mom... but with my dad too.&nbsp; sometimes i wish i was more like a normal asian kid... you know... the high gpa... graduated med school when they were like 15.&nbsp; all i do is make life hard for my parents... as they've had to sacrifice a lot to raise me... and my brother.&nbsp; nyu and columbia don't come cheap... hockey, violin/piano lessons, various trips to broaden our horizons, all of that stuff... it's all supposed to make me better.&nbsp; somehow though... while it seems to have worked on jon... with me... i just got less and less motivated... and pissed a good chunk of it away.&nbsp; the&nbsp;worst thing is... while this was all happening... i knew it was going on... but i just didn't change myself fast enough... and it kinda snowballed.&nbsp; anyways... family ties are still very strong for asians... when your parents grow old... you're supposed to take care of them... that's how i always saw it... supposed to.&nbsp; now though... it's more of a sense of wanting to... after all they've gone through for me... it's the least i can do.&nbsp; i think in the past... i had realized it... but it had kind of overwhelmed me... to the point where i was just paralyzed as i didn't even know what was going on with my own life.&nbsp; so now... i want to assume the duties... even though i still don't know where i'm going to be even a year from now in my life... i have a couple general goals but the main one is family related i guess.&nbsp;&nbsp;find a steady stable career that pays well enough to support a future family and any relatives on&nbsp;either side of the fam.&nbsp; i want to be able to tell the people i love that they can do whatever they want... and money won't be an issue... i think in the end... that's what will make me happy.&nbsp; people make me happy... friends make me happy... and you can't get much more friendly-people than family people (at least most of the time).&nbsp; so asian guilt or not... i've gotta make it happen... and hopefully it will all work out.

      so i went to church this morning... recently... i've been going... but my mind's been distracted... and i just haven't been feeling connected to my spiritual side anymore.&nbsp; i think it's cause i've been frustrated with school... and just feeling like i don't know where i'm headed cause in reality... i'm still uncertain if anything i'm doing now will pay off in the end.&nbsp; today's service kinda recentered and refocused me a bit... it's been awhile since the message @ service has kinda spoken to me... it's a good feeling... my mind calms down a bit... and i'm kinda saying "ahhhh... that's the answer..." to myself.&nbsp; those are the good moments... when you feel like God is just answering you through simple actions... ie. going to church and hearing a sermon which seems specially tailored for oneself.&nbsp; so i'm feeling better... and more at ease now than i have been feeling these last 2-3 weeks.  there is some excellent news... ricky williams has announced that he is  urlLink retiring .&nbsp; that is great news for the bills.&nbsp; if feeley doesn't pan out... the dophins will yet again have to rely on fiedler... who while he's a generally good qb overall (but not a great qb)... always seems to fold during the pressure games.&nbsp; with the qb situation very much in question, and the backfield pretty much empty... the bills have a good chance of running the table on the dolphins this year... which is very exciting.&nbsp; hopefully miami won't be able to pick up anyone else through a trade or whatever... i want to crush them... badly... just like we used to... before the gregg williams/rob johnson&nbsp;era... which was embarrassing.&nbsp; don't even get me started about last year... dreadful... awful... dreadully awful.&nbsp; wtf's up with our pro&nbsp;teams?  anyone want to buy an affordable&nbsp;home that's huge and has everything you've always wanted?&nbsp; buy one in  urlLink buffalo .&nbsp; i laugh when i read about home prices here... cause it's not like prices in other areas.&nbsp; you have these giant houses that sell for $2-$3 million here... and those are the really really expensive homes.&nbsp; $2-$3 million will get you like a frickin studio apartment in new york or s.f. (yes i'm exaggerating a little... but not that much).&nbsp; so... if you have lots of cash to burn... and want a summer home... buy one here... you can spend your entire summer @ duffs and the anchor bar... and eat all the wings you've ever wanted.&nbsp; i promise you... you'll like the summers here.  next  urlLink installment  of star wars.&nbsp; it's gonna suck just like the phantom menace sucked... just like the clone wars sucked... but you'll see it... cause you'll feel obligated to... cause it's star wars... then you'll think about how you were stupid for wasting money on it... cause it's gonna suck... and you already knew it was gonna be bad.&nbsp; george lucas totally crapped the bed with the prequels.  that is all... have a good night.

      so... i just used the&nbsp;hello software by picasa... which is now a part of google making it a sister company of blogger/blogspot for the first time.&nbsp; it's pretty neato... and it's easy to use.&nbsp; anyone know how much storage we have?&nbsp; is it just an endless amount (i'm guessing no... but then what's the limit?)&nbsp; so... anyways... these are pretty much all of my pics i got developed.&nbsp; perhaps i'll rescan them @ ub in the lab with a better scanner and repost them in a photo album on a site somewhere else.&nbsp; i'm sorry some of them came out a bit blurry... my scanner is a pos... i bought it when i was a sophomore @ nyu... which is maybe 6 years ago?&nbsp; it's probably been pretty banged up as well... seeing that i've moved around new york... and back home to buffalo numerous times in between.&nbsp; maybe i'll show you the originals if any of you are around or interested.   i'll take the digital down to the waterfront and tifft and hopefully have pics with better clarity.  so... that is all... i'm all blogged out today.

      go here... and watch this  urlLink cartoon .  pics this afternoon?&nbsp; we'll see how they come out.  it's going to be  urlLink close  again.&nbsp; nader must bow out.&nbsp; we cannot allow the chance of another 4 years of bush to be possible.&nbsp; this isn't about having a variety of choices anymore... we've already made too many mistakes, another 4 years of the current administration would be disasterous.&nbsp; tax cuts ballooning the debt and deficeit to levels surpassing anything we've ever seen before, a larger gap between wealthy and modestly off, civil liberties taken away, and an international feeling of resentment towards the US that will grow exponentially.&nbsp; so you see... choices are good... variety is good... but if you can't or should i say aren't alive to make them... choices mean nothing.&nbsp; there are almost 6.5 billion people in the world and only about 300 million americans.&nbsp; we are a little less than 5% of the world population.&nbsp; the numbers are not in our favor if we further isolate and alienate our country from others.&nbsp; we also have to take into account that being only less than 5% of the global population... are we really right in the actions we have taken especially pertaining to iraq?&nbsp; could we be the 1 dumb, brash, and arrogant kid in the classroom of 20 students?&nbsp; lastly... if we believe and are constantly proclaiming the virtues of democracy... how do we not allow the international community to move forward a plan of action for&nbsp;situations that have global consequences?&nbsp; instead... we acted unilaterally.&nbsp; ironic... no?  more later.

      the chem test this morning was pretty hard... but... i'm glad it's over.&nbsp; only 2 more weeks of chem 2... and then i'll spend a couple days here... and a couple days in new york... and a couple more days here... and then i start orgo, physics 2, anat & phys 1, and public speaking (yeah... i never took a public speaking class... and unfortunately for me some pharm programs explicitly have it down in their prereqs... and they won't allow you to deviate from them).  so... i dropped off my roll of film @ the local eckerd... but they're backed up... so i won't have it til tomorrow.&nbsp; one thing i found funny... something that i've noticed before... but i guess subconsciously or something... cause i'm really thinking about it now... it's another one of those new york city things... when you ask a person who was born and raised or who's lived in new york for their phone number... they will give you their area code.&nbsp; it just becomes 2nd nature.&nbsp; in most of the US, the population is spread out among a pretty large area... so there's usually an area code for enough numbers in the area.&nbsp; take western new york... a little over&nbsp;1 million people live within the buffalo-niagara region... but we all have 716 area codes... mobiles, landline, fax, pagers, whatever... it's all included.&nbsp; then you take new york... 212 (the most well known), 718 these are the 2 old school landline codes for manhattan and queens/bronx/brooklyn/staten island respectively.&nbsp; then you have the introduction of 917 for the cell phones covering all of the new york region... and then those ran out so they added 646 for cell phones in the whole region and landlines in manhattan... and those were running out i guess... so recently they added 347.&nbsp; so that's 5 different area codes for 1 region.&nbsp; which is kind of insane... but needed... between all the businesses, organizations, people, etc., you definitely need that many codes.&nbsp; anyways... my point is... i'm so used to giving out my area code... for my number... and when i do it anywhere else... people start writing down the area code as the 3 digits of the actual number... skipping the area code part... cause they assume automatically that you don't have a different area code.&nbsp; like today... when the photo guy at eckerd asked for my # as he was filling out the photo form thingy... i think i threw him off when i actually said 716.&nbsp; it'd be interesting to know if people thought i was&nbsp;crazy or being funny or whatever when that happens.&nbsp; i can't help it... i've just been programmed by new york... like the times i'm tempted to pull out an umbrella when it starts raining...  hmmm... what else... oh... so as i was driving today... i thought about how you can access and maybe even assess people's lives (to a certain extent) through the rear-view mirror of your car.&nbsp; it's like a secret window into other people's lives.&nbsp; you can catch people doing some weird things @ traffic lights.&nbsp; it's kinda cool i guess... being able to observe spiecies in their "natural" habitats.&nbsp; that girl or guy in front of you can do the same thing... so maybe next time when you're in a car... do something really strange when you're stopped @ a light... you might make someone laugh and make their day... and give em a new story to tell friends.  so here's some big  urlLink news ... molson &amp; coors are merging.&nbsp; buffalo is a labatt city... and even though i don't ever really drink anymore... on the rare occasions that i do... beer-wise... it's pretty much always been labatt...&nbsp;and on even rarer occasions... molson's have been in the mix.&nbsp; those are pretty much the only choices... when having beer... need canadian beer... and if that's the case... those are 2 that are readily available here.&nbsp; there&nbsp;is one&nbsp;thing i have to give credit to molson for though... the "i am canadian" ad campaign from awhile back.&nbsp; i was kinda sad when the molson centre was renamed to the bell centre... cause you can't get much more canadian than hockey and beer... and that was just a good combo.&nbsp; i guess i'm kinda sad about this merger... i hope coors doesn't screw things up... labatt was folded into interbrew a couple years ago... but... interbrew is a pretty large international brewing company... so... i think they'd give more leeway to the people running their subdivisions to just run them like they've always done.&nbsp; coors on the otherhand... is pretty much contained in the US... i just hope they don't get the "we always know what's right" attitude that so much of america subscribes to... and not mess up a good product.  i just read this yesterday... turns out amc is&nbsp;turning  urlLink private ... interesting how there was a big explosion of theaters just a couple years ago... and now... a bunch are being shuttered... and cineplex's are merging or being bought out.&nbsp; amc is in pretty good shape though... i'm just disappointed i didn't invest in the stock... it's quite volatile... and if i were to have bought and sold @ the correct times... i probably could've retired in the&nbsp;from the&nbsp;years that i played with the stock or something =].  here's some good  urlLink news ... air america radio network is doing better... and has stabalized a bit.&nbsp; whatever puts us closer to getting o'rielly off the air... is better.&nbsp; al franken is a funny guy too!  here's a link to a strange  urlLink pic ...  hopefully buffalo can draw people with health sciences and business  urlLink skills ... or keep them in the area after they graduate.&nbsp; we need to build a base to take off on.  i will shoot myself if i see another six flags commercial... and speaking of commercials that piss me off... the west-herr guy auto group guy... and that chevy year end clearance commercial... with the big&nbsp;tractor truck&nbsp;and&nbsp;how it's hitched truck bed is all sliding down a parking lot up to a dealer... i can't explain it any better (sorry for those who haven't seen it... or should i not apologize cause it's just that bad)... but it's just annoying... cause who would ever do that?&nbsp; plus it looks totally fake.  that's all for now... hope you all have a good friday.

      my head hurts... i have no idea what's going on in lab... for real.  so it's  urlLink tc's  birthday today...&nbsp;leave a comment on his blog... and wish him a good one... while you still have time.  that is all... i can't see straight anymore.

      guess what?&nbsp; another titration in lab today... i didn't mess it up so bad like the previous one... but it still didn't turn out right.&nbsp; i'm just bad @ titrations... it requires too much... perfection... which i have none of.  &nbsp;  so i guess the 2nd  urlLink red hat  9.0 cd that i burned awhile ago is scratched or something... cause i keep getting failed media... when i test it.&nbsp; i guess i'll have to&nbsp;make the move to the&nbsp; urlLink fedora  project.&nbsp; i did get some new hard drives for my old linux box... (2) 80 gig seagates w/ 8 meg caches.&nbsp; load up fedora on one, and hopefully (as i haven't had very much luck with x86&nbsp; urlLink solaris  in the past, especially when it comes to getting x up and running), solaris 9 on the other.&nbsp; if i get too frustrated with the solaris install... i guess i'll get the latest 5.x release of  urlLink freebsd .&nbsp; in any case... i'd like to get a unix or linux system up with apache, php, and mysql so i can test some web stuff that i'm developing asap.  &nbsp;  i think it'd be cool to live in japan... or hong kong... or one of the industrialized asian nations/regions for a little bit.&nbsp; lots and lots of  urlLink toys ...  &nbsp;  i found  urlLink this  kinda interesting too... the change in the significance of sundays in the US over the last century.&nbsp; there's been a pretty big shift into a 24/7 lifestyle... which at times... going back to the toys thing... i am a big proponent of toys... but on the other... sometimes i think we're getting too connected to things.&nbsp; sometimes we need to just take it easy... and i find that the more stuff i take on... the more time i need to refocus myself... or i'll just get overwhelmed and break.&nbsp; there'll be days where i'll lay in bed and daydream... longing for a return to a time when tom sawyer had his adventures in mark twain's great novels... or wanting to be a kid again... cause everything was possible and your imagination had no bounds.&nbsp; remember all those stupid games you'd make up with your brothers/sisters/friends?&nbsp; remember all the trouble you got into for your "adventures"?&nbsp; why do&nbsp;most kids want to be older?&nbsp; and many adults want to be younger?&nbsp; i wonder what most people would say their favorite age was.&nbsp; i wonder when i turned from happy tyke to pessimistic old man?&nbsp; i remember i was a pretty happy kid growing up... but as the years went by... that all disappeared.&nbsp; i'd say the&nbsp;year that that happend was a bad year...  &nbsp;  gimme my cardigan... and walker... it's past my bedtime... get off my lawn you lousy kids!&nbsp; =]

      interesting post on callalillie's blog on her recent excursion to  urlLink governor's island ... she's got some pics up too.&nbsp; i think it'd be cool to do this when i head back to the city in a couple weeks.&nbsp; i want to do coney island too... which i didn't get a chance to do last time.&nbsp; it'd be nice to ride the cyclone and deno's giant wheel... and get my amusement park on... cause i sure ain't giving six flags any money after their insanely annoying ad campaign this summer. &nbsp; here's another interesting  urlLink blog ... this one&nbsp;just recently started.&nbsp; i'm not sure if this was started as a fictional account or what... but if it's real... it's really interesting... and if it isn't... well it's still really interesting too (and the person writing is really creative). &nbsp; on many nights... i have trouble falling asleep... i think my day night cycles are totally opposite.&nbsp; sometimes i'll take melatonin... but i try not to take it too often cause i started to notice a bit of a psychological dependency on the supplements.&nbsp; i used to find and throw in a low key cd and let that put me to sleep.&nbsp; from past experience, i've found that sarah mclachlan works pretty well... she's got an amazing voice and usually with her fumbling cd i can be asleep by the 5th or 6th track.&nbsp; last night though... it didn't work cause i got too focused on the music, her voice, and the lyrics so instead of putting me to sleep... my mind was all over and thinking.&nbsp; one of my thoughts was how it'd be nice to exist in between words and music... especially&nbsp;in between the words and music of a musician&nbsp;like sarah.&nbsp; her music is such a delicate balance of poetry, instrumental, and there's such forceful emotion at times, and hushed calmness at others... it'd be interesting to connect oneself into that.&nbsp; i think the two songs that made me think of this were  elsewhare  and  ice  on the fumbling album.&nbsp; i think someone like sarah can bring the listener into the whole spectrum&nbsp;of emotions and connect with them&nbsp;at so many levels&nbsp;and with such intensity (if the listener chooses to connect i guess) in a period of four to five minutes... and that's really tough to do for anyone.&nbsp; i think that takes a bunch of talent in order for someone to do that.&nbsp; anyways... that connection to music (or any art form) is what makes people crave it... cause it evokes some raw emotion in mere seconds of time.&nbsp; i think the closest i can come to existing in that space though... is that period of time right before you wake up from a nap or sleep... when you're conscious but not quite... and you're just dreaming.&nbsp; you know?&nbsp; when you can still feel frightened, or happy, or pain, or warmth and it just feels so real... and i guess life feels real at the moment.&nbsp; when you finally wake up though, you sort of settle down, and i think by the end of the day, and over time, you just become dull to things.&nbsp; i'm kinda scared of that... becoming dull and boring... but i can see it happening to me now... and perhaps that's why i'm worried. &nbsp; so... that's that with that... i think i have 2 more things i found interesting/funny... and then i must do some more... guess what?&nbsp; yup... chem. &nbsp; i think toronto has it  urlLink right .&nbsp; toronto's metro area is growing so fast.&nbsp; i remember going up when i was a kid (early to mid 80s)... places like mississauga hadn't even been developed yet... and scarborough was the large burb of toronto.&nbsp; by redeveloping older and underused portions of the city... this prevents sprawl... and allows older buildings to be reused and preserved instead of falling into disrepair... which could cost more to clean up in the future (exactly what happend to buffalo).&nbsp; it does save tax money too... and allows for a better mix of people in the central city... as opposed to the people with money moving further away while the less wealthy are stuck. &nbsp; last little ditty... you gotta love the  urlLink w.t. &nbsp;and boy... there sure is a lot of w.t. in florida... with their dirty mullets, nascar hats, and classic stained used-to-be-white wife-beaters.&nbsp; then there's the w.t. women... i only got 1 word... hot (hehe... umm... no not quite).&nbsp; but in all seriousness... who hits people with a gator?&nbsp; what is that thing?&nbsp; an alligator?&nbsp; what? &nbsp; and that is all.

      so i got some chem done today... went out to dinner with  urlLink leng  and jill @ the olive garden.&nbsp; came home... did some more chem. &nbsp; i'm feeling pretty good today... i guess the panic hasn't kicked in yet for the 50 labs due next week and the big 2nd test.&nbsp; perhaps i should be worried that i'm so relaxed?&nbsp; i guess i'll see how tomorrow goes.&nbsp; i'll probably be hyperventilating and the insomnia will kick in from the anxiety tomorrow night. &nbsp; enough of that for now though... more important matters. &nbsp; i found this  urlLink posted  on tien mao's little red book... more info on the six flags commercial and a link to their site so you can watch them i think.&nbsp; i CAN'T stand the ad anymore.&nbsp; it seems to come on every commercial break... and i haven't even been watching tv lately... maybe the local and network news, jeopardy, late night news, and conan... and i won't make it through that much on most days.&nbsp; i want to punch that guy. &nbsp; what else do we have... ahhh yes... show... no really...  urlLink this  is pretty cool.&nbsp; i'm happy to see the spirit and opportunity are still going strong... going way beyond their life span.&nbsp; kinda surprising considering how the&nbsp;polar lander/deep space 2&nbsp;mission got derailed... kinda not cause it's nasa... you'd figure if you had that many smart people working they'd get something right.&nbsp; speaking of which... my friend bern did a co-op @&nbsp;nasa's jet propulsion laboratory&nbsp;for the&nbsp;the&nbsp;deep&nbsp;space 2&nbsp;mission... and even though it didn't work as supposed to... i still think it's pretty damn cool that he worked @ the jpl. &nbsp; now that i've given some of you a chance to see spider-man 2... i just want to say it's really really good.&nbsp; i saw part of the first one again recently... and i must say... it's put together much better than the first one.&nbsp; it doesn't seem as rushed, and the character development is just really cool to see.&nbsp; i feel like it's what the hulk tried to be, but the hulk didn't quite make it... possibly because the hulk tried to take on too much, so the story didn't flow as well as it just got bogged down.&nbsp; it was a perfect sequel though, kinda like the x-men sequel... as the first movie i was just psyched to see cause it was spider-man... the coolest of all superheros... i used to watch the cartoon when i was small... and all that.&nbsp; so the first movie was cool... cause it was spider-man... on the big screen with the wall crawling... and the web zip zipping... and the wise cracking.&nbsp; the second though, did all that... but over a longer period of time... so there was depth to it.&nbsp; it's good to see spider-man go through the dillema of being a superhero... unlike other people guys who seem to just do it.&nbsp; it's interesting to watch the internal struggle... raimi &amp; the scriptwriters did a good job with it.&nbsp; i think that's what attracts people to a spider-man or the x-men... cause they're the so called "good guys", but people think they're bad... so at times they will question why they're doing the things they're doing... protecting people when people don't want them around.&nbsp; it shows a vulnerability and a conscious decision to keep being good... it's an internal struggle... and people identify with that... cause who hasn't struggled?&nbsp; people like superman... he's cool and all... but how do you relate to this guy?&nbsp; everyone likes him... everyone knows he's the good guy. &nbsp; and in contrast to  urlLink tc ... i just want to say i liked dodgeball more than anchorman.&nbsp; i thought anchorman was put together very sloppily... and rushed.&nbsp; the plot was disjointed... it seemed like they were going in a million directions. &nbsp; and now i'm going to sleep.

      i just downloaded their photobot software... so i can post stuff automatically now... and their new blog posting interface is really nice too.&nbsp; thanks google... you are awesome. &nbsp; so i just got back from jay's... i met up with him and we walked a block south to hertel where the italian fest was going on.&nbsp; lots of people... lots of canoli, fried dough, pasta, pizza, sausage (sassage), etc., etc.&nbsp; i ate the biggest thing of fried dough... it was awesome... and who doesn't like italian sausage?&nbsp; i should've picked up some italian ice... that's what i was missing.&nbsp; yum.&nbsp; i think i might go to canalfest with jill in tonawanda.&nbsp; i think i figured out why our summers here are packed with these festivals.&nbsp; 1) to maximize time spent outside since we spend much of it inside in the winter.&nbsp; 2) to build up our fat reserves in our body for winter.&nbsp; so anyways... that was good. &nbsp; here's something my friend kim in buffalo sent me.&nbsp; if you get a chance, read over it.&nbsp; it's about the fighting and killing going on in sudan (just one of many places in the world).&nbsp; it's an organized campaign to contact our elected officials to release funds quickly and efficiently to provide humanitarian aid for those that need our help the most.&nbsp; these aid packages are included in bills and resolutions going up for votes hopefully in the near future.&nbsp; everything's organized for you already, you just have to visit the site(s) and fill in the forms with your info.&nbsp; the first link will send a fax to your congressional reps, the second link provides more in depth information and a petition that you can sign.  We call upon our governments and the United Nations to intervene immediately to protect civilians and guarantee the delivery of humanitarian aid in Darfur, Sudan.We are one human family, and each of our lives is equally valuable. The mass extermination of human beings is a crime against humanity, a crime against every person on the planet. The international community has a responsibility to protect the fundamental rights of every person. When governments prey upon their own people, the international community has a responsibility to intervene.For too long we have allowed the worst of crimes to go unchallenged. 10 years ago, international failure to stop the genocide in Rwanda shamed the world. Now, in Darfur, we must once more say ‘Never Again’ to genocide. And this time, we must mean it.  - urlLink http://www.faithfulamerica.org/darfur.htm  - urlLink http://www.darfurgenocide.org/  &nbsp; hmmm... what else... oh yes.&nbsp; blood bank blood levels are very very  urlLink low  in the US... especially in the northeast.&nbsp; if you aren't restricted from donating blood, please do.&nbsp; you can really help someone else.&nbsp; it only takes about an hour, filling out forms, donating blood, apple juice &amp; cookies and a little time to stay put... and you'll be off.&nbsp; i don't think anything brings us together as humans like blood can.&nbsp; when you're in trouble and you need blood... it doesn't matter if it came from an asian, african, caucasian, mexican, russian, man or woman, newborn or elderly person, we all bleed the same thing.&nbsp; you never know who you'll be able to help just by setting aside and hour of your time, perhaps that pint that you gave up will be the one that gives the doctors extra time to close a suture.&nbsp; the above link was for new york and pennsylvania red cross donation site, here's the  urlLink link  for the national red cross site.&nbsp; my appointment's tomorrow @ 1:15pm. &nbsp; which reminds me... i have a postcard of this one blood piece of artwork by an artist whose name i cannot think of at the moment.&nbsp; they made the piece in response to september 11th by using one drop of blood from volunteers on a sheet of canvas, and it captures the essence of the fact that we all bleed the same no matter where we're from or who we are.&nbsp; when i find the postcard... i'll scan it and post it. &nbsp; my friend  urlLink outlandishjosh  is involved with  urlLink music for america &nbsp;and it's sub and lateral groups.&nbsp; they have some fun stuff @ this  urlLink link .&nbsp; i encourage you to check out the mfa site, as they're trying to use music to bring people together and organize as a political bloc against the re-election of bush.&nbsp; it's actually pretty amazing how much more the net is being leveraged for this current election.&nbsp; there are a host of different sites that are banding together, both for the conservatives and liberals in the country.&nbsp; just to think that a decade or so ago, the internet was still unavailable to most, or available only as a text based medium through gopher, usenet, and email. &nbsp; this is a  urlLink blow  to grad students @ private universities.&nbsp; it's too bad, given that grad students usually get treated like crap anyways.&nbsp; i'm sure nyu is happy about this those greedy bastages... they'll be able to roll back the concessions the students won a couple years ago, while still keeping tuition @ the same level.&nbsp; it's not like i could afford nyu when i went there the first time... now... it's just plain impossible.&nbsp; i mean... wtf?&nbsp; isn't it pushing 40k for a year now?&nbsp; that's like a year's salary for someone in mid-upper middle class... and upper class in some areas of the country.&nbsp; even though i'm not so big on unions... i think they're needed at times, especially when fair and equitable treatment is in question. &nbsp; well... that's all for now... i took a pic @ the italian fest looking down toward the east on hertel ave.&nbsp; i guess i have 1 more before i can develop.&nbsp; maybe i'll find something cool to snap a pic of tomorrow.&nbsp; nights.

      so i think i did pretty well on the chem thing today... so i'm happy.&nbsp; unfortunately i decided not to go to sotw @ thurs @ the square so i could study... which really stinks... cause i've been looking forward to the show since may when they released the sched of shows.&nbsp; plus they haven't been playing on the east these last couple years... just mainly sticking&nbsp;to vancouver and the western provinces.&nbsp; i guess i should be happy that it wasn't a really&nbsp;good summer&nbsp;day yesterday... cause that would've just made me feel worse about it all. &nbsp; anyways... at least the weekend is here.&nbsp;&nbsp;buffalo's italian fest started yesterday and goes through sunday.&nbsp; i'm gonna hit that up with jay and whoever else wants to join i guess.&nbsp; too bad for baer... he's gonna miss the sass-age.&nbsp; at least i don't have to deal with stocham... and him going off for a corn dog or some crap like that... total bs. &nbsp; if you live in buffalo-niagara... and want to support a community&nbsp;organization trying to&nbsp;bring the region to the attention&nbsp;of site selectors and companies visit this  urlLink site  and read over who they are and what they're trying to do.&nbsp; it does encourage me cause i see more people actually stepping out and trying to change things around here instead of waiting for our narrow-viewed old-guard local politicians who just aren't fast enough to adjust to changing situations and time.&nbsp; throwing money at problems doesn't work all the time (i don't even know if it works at all)... and people are finding that they have to do it themselves.&nbsp; we haven't had people take on these public community leadership positions in awhile... these people are important catalysts... and i only see good things coming. &nbsp; congrats to canada for  urlLink placing  in the top 5.&nbsp; i'd have ranked it #1 (of course).&nbsp; i know you're thinking in your head... "hey... most of the countries in the top 5 are big hockey countries"... which is true too... coincidence?&nbsp; definitely not... nope.&nbsp; the list also includes countries that aren't to&nbsp;cool to live in.&nbsp; which brings me to my next thought.&nbsp; industrialized nations need to help out... especially the g-8... and more specifically the US.&nbsp; we need to stop messing around with stuff just cause we can or we believe it's right.&nbsp;&nbsp;whatever actions we take&nbsp;may be right (saddam out=good)... but it helps to take the time explain and get others on board (and have justifiable credible information that's been checked and rechecked multiple times), instead of making&nbsp;our decisions and always thinking we're right (iraqis are going to welcome us and let us take control of their country)... which... in the end... we found we weren't right.&nbsp; it's a dangerous mentality when you think you'll never be wrong... cause you fall a lot harder when you are wrong.&nbsp; we have the means to help improve life around the world.&nbsp; we need to be a good leader... and lead by example.&nbsp; our intentions may be good... but our actions and outcomes are what we are judged by.&nbsp; whatever we do, we have to make sure as best we can, that those actions and outcomes will lead to better relations rather than bitter consequences.

      i totally screwed the pooch on the titration today in chem lab... continuing my tradition of titration f*ck-ups.  only... in chem 101 this past spring... i overadded NaOH solution... this time... i didn't even get a chance to get that right... everything about my setup was wrong... and i didn't figure it out until i had already spent a good amount of lab working on it.  on the positive side... my ta is cool... and she worked something out.  so i don't know if i'm gonna go to the sotw show yet... i feel like i need to study chem.  i guess i'll see in a bit.

      don't have much time to post... gotta study some more...  low carb on the way  urlLink out ?  i'm glad people are beginning to figure out that it's not healthy to load up on everything non carb.  variety of the carb kind is the best... so many yummy foods that are filled with carbohydrates... including tasty vegetables and fruits.  meat 24x7 is no good... if you don't turn into a fat piece of crap... i'll bet you'll sure feel like it... when your arteries clog up.  actually on second thought... maybe we should encourage those low/no carb-ers to keep pushing on... maybe they'll just die off... it'll be a natural way to kill off the stupid population.   urlLink powernapping  for money!  i wish i thought of it... and opened up a place in the city... i think it'll probably catch on... especially in a place like nyc... and like everything else... if they cater to the right crowd... they can charge lots of money and reap the profits.  powernaps are nice... but you have to get up after 20 or so minutes... cause if you go back to sleep for another 30... you'll get up groggy as anything.  go lynne cheney you  urlLink tell  that dick who's boss... pun intended... er something... jah...  yah... more planned bike  urlLink trails  in the buffalo area.  i don't understand people who shoot down good ideas on the basis that they'll bring "bad elements" etc.  everything can bring bad elements... if you build a large shopping center... people from all over head to it... if you build a public transportation system... bad people can then move around a larger area... it goes on and on.  but... you can't just sit at home and worry about that stuff... heck... you don't know if you walk out the door the next day if you'll get hit by a car coming out of your driveway... does that mean we shouldn't build roads?  c'mon now... that's just a bad argument... in the end... it'll benefit the public by increasing healthy activity... and add to the benefits of the area.  who doesn't want to live in an area with lots of park and greenspace that citizens can actually use?  hmmmm... i'm actually feeling ok today... i'm a bit worried about my lack of studying for my chem quiz fri.  here's what i decided... if it rains tomorrow... i'm not going to the spirit of the west show @ the square... and i'll study.  if it doesn't rain tomorrow... well... then... i think i just might have to go... but if it starts to rain @ any point during the show... i'll take it as a sign that i should study.  i won't necessarily take the rain tomorrow... but... good song... and i haven't listened to this album in awhile... i guess i'll put it on while i'm studying for chem... night.    I'll Take the Rain , REM  The rain came down The rain came down The rain came down on me.  The wind blew strong The summer song Fades to memory  I knew you when I loved you then The summer's young and helpless.  You laid me bare You marked me there The promises we made.  I used to think As birds take wing They sing through life so why can't we? You cling to this You claim the best If this is what you're offering I'll take the rain I'll take the rain I'll take the rain.  The nighttime creases Summer schemes And stretches out to stay. The sun shines down You came around You love easy days.  But now the sun, The winter's come. I wanted just to say That if I hold I'd hope you'd fold Open up inside, inside of me.  I used to think As birds take wing They sing through life so why can't we? You cling to this You claim the best If this is what you're offering I'll take the rain I'll take the rain I'll take the rain.  This winter song I'll sing along I've searched its still refrain I'll walk alone I've given this, take wing Celebrate the rain.  I used to think As birds take wing They sing through life so why can't we? You cling to this You claim the best If this is what you're offering I'll take the rain I'll take the rain I'll take the rain.

      so here's my new friend... he's (or she's?) the one that's been hanging around our backyard... all with its mini-hop and all.  =]     here's an  urlLink article  that's got me drooling... er... something.  it'd be so sweet to have a datapipe that big... a gig/sec that's pretty nice.  nerd stuff i know... shhhh!  i've been working on a  urlLink site  for a  urlLink client ... converting it from lots of images and a flash file to text and css... so that it can get indexed by the search engines and hopefully drive more biz.  they're putting off a total reworking right now... maybe in the future...  that is all... i need to do a lab writeup.

      here's a pic i took 2 summers ago... from the fire escape of the building were i worked.  the pic of the brooklyn bridge in the previous post was from 2 summers ago as well.  i need to take 2 more pics and then i can develop my new roll... and put them up.  any ideas?  maybe the sotw show thur...     aug 12-21  if you have not yet heard...  urlLink odd todd  is getting his own  urlLink cartoon  on comedy central.  it should be funny.  if you haven't checked out his flash toons... you owe it to yourself to go to his site.  i'm tired.  i need to sleep.

      i'm gonna book my flight to nyc tomorrow...     just a couple more weeks of this to go through.  i just want to finish summer... and breathe a little... settle down my thoughts and recenter myself again.  i'm struggling and unfocused.    Red , Treble Charger  Saw you looking for a light Face painted cigarette white You asked the cleanest boy you found You couldn't see me turned around His fingers stretched across your empty gaze That I just can't escape  As the red fades from your wrinkled dress A picture of the people you've impressed Hangs on a wall around here Vision starts to crawl when I'm near And the evening waits  While you get caught up to your own mistakes Made up different lines I wouldn't wanna keep in my mind  I wondered why you'd come around Remembering your little girl frown Your answers kept the crowd at bay With compliments unwilling to pay I had some things I'd like to say to you But they just can't be true

      spent a bunch of the day in out in the sun... a bit dehydrated... had to take some naproxen for a headache... but otherwise doing well.  headed down to the taste of buffalo with  urlLink tc ... lots of people walking around... mullets and mustaches... good times.  checked out tifft... went to the marina and waterfront... allentown... anderson's (beef on weck & vanilla custard)... and saw anchorman.  it was a pretty nice day... took some pics... they're on normal film cause i wanted to use all of that up so you'll have to wait til i get them developed... but they'll be up soon.  here's a cool  urlLink bikeride  that i'm gonna think about doing for next summer maybe.  good news... the low are releasing their new album at the end of sept on the maple music label... and david usher's 3rd solo album is dropping in sept too.   urlLink spirit of the west  are playing this thur in the square... i'm pretty pumped.    Autobiography , Sloan  I'm writing "young and gifted"  In my autobiography  I figured, who would know  Better than me   I'm certainly the former  But I'm not so much the latter  But no one's gonna read it  So I'm sure it doesn't matter   When you find that you're the former  Take pride in how you form  And when you find that you're the ladder  Don't let those people walk under you   I'm writing "sharp and adult"  With my finger on the steam  On the mirror in my bathroom  While I'm applying shaving cream   Which would suggest that I'm the foamer  But how can I be the lather  And something tells me  It's the opposite I'd rather   When you find that you're the foamer  Be careful what you foam  When you find that you're the lather  Don't shave too high, you'll regret it later  La la la la   I've stayed in school this long  But still no one will tell me why  They figured who would know  Better than I   I know I'm a conformer  But I'm sure it doesn't matter  My new friends are all adults  And my old friends all have scattered   When you find you're a conformer  Take pride and swallow whole  But if you're trying to climb the ladder  Don't let people walk over you  Because that's just what they'll do  Don't let people walk over you  Because that's just what they'll do  that is all... i need to pass out.

      i'm having one of those days that i just miss people.  i feel disconnected from the world somehow.  i'm not feeling bad or anything... but i'm not feeling good either.  i don't feel like i'm making much of an impact in much... i feel like i'm blending into the background noise of life as it passes by.  i don't know... i've always enjoyed being around good people... and even though i might not talk much... just being in the company of friends is my kinda natural high.  so i do miss people... ones that will take a walk to chelsea piers or up to greenpoint... or drive over to baird point and glen falls and just sit around cause it's something to do.  it's tough when life is in flux... i hope i'm not wasting time... cause time's important.  people and relationships don't last forever... anyone can disappear instantly.  so i guess i'm questioning if i should be where i am... or should i be somewhere else doing something else.    This Is A Fire Door Never Leave Open , The Weakerthans  Headlights race towards the corner of the dining room. Half illuminate a face before they disappear. You breathe in forty years of failing to describe a feeling. I breathe out smoke against the window, trace the letters in your name. Our letters sound the same; full of all our changing that isn't change at all. All straight lines circle sometime. You said "Somewhere there's a box full of replacement parts to all the tenderness we've broken or let rust away. Somewhere sympathy is more than just a way of leaving. Somewhere someone says 'I'm sorry.' Someone's making plans to stay." So tell me it's okay. Tell me anything, or show me there's a pull, unassailable, that will lead you there, from the dark, alone, benevolence that you've never known, or you knew when you were four and can't remember. Where a small knife tears out those sloppy seams, and the silence knows what you silence means, and your metaphors (as mixed as you can make them) are linked, like days, together. I still hear trains at night, when the wind is right. I remember everything, lick and thread this string that will never mend you or tailor more than a memory of a kitchen floor, or the fire-door that we kept propping open. And I love this place; the enormous sky, and the faces, hands that I'm haunted by, so why can't I forgive these buildings, these frameworks labeled "Home"?

      i don't know if six flags is showing these commercials in all their markets... but since buffalo's in the six flags darien lake market... there's been commecials in which this guy who's made to look really old gets off a bus and starts dancing to really annoying music.  i hate the ad... and it also frightens me.  someone make it stop... please!  so we have a family of rabbits living in our back yard... 2 parents and a baby.  they are cute... they'll be out in the back just chillin and eating our grass and whatnot.  i think our neighbors across the way have a groundhog that lives under their deck.  sometimes he'll pop out too and chill with the rabbits... and he'll all waddle around with all his pudginess.  he's fun.  chem test fri... taste of buffalo sat & sun... i'm gonna stuff myself with yummy food and the weather's supposed to be nice.  maybe i'll catch anchorman this weekend.  bedtime... night.

      overall... it was a good weekend.  the concert sat was really nice... perfect weather... sun setting... good views down the streets and avenues coming out of niagara square.  it looked kinda surreal.  ben folds was really good... played some old solo stuff... new solo stuff... covers... and old ben folds five stuff.  picked up some mighty and went out to cozumel after.  jay had an interesting night with people from his past... you'll need to ask him about that... it cracked me up.  all in all... a good night.  now sunday was really muggy and hot.  it rained... and i didn't end up going to the 2nd show... but i guess a good number of people went out.  most were down there already for ani before it really started coming down.  streets downtown were flooded... the kensington was in bad shape i guess... and all the way down to orchard park was a mess.  i ended up going up to grand island to see kris for a bit.  it was nice to see a new york person again.  now that i think about it... it's kinda weird when you're roomates with someone... and you pretty much see them on a daily basis... and then it changes really quickly... and you almost don't notice it until you've had time to see them away from the normal environment you used to see them in.  even the last time i went back to the city in may... i didn't really think it was all that different to see linds and kris and mara... cause the context in a relational standpoint has always been within the confines of new york.  this time... it was nice... but now that i think more about it... it was strange too.  ummm... jah...  urlLink tansal  disappeared somewhere... i don't know where he is.  he wants to see spider-man 2 again when he makes his return to the buff.  i think i may join him.  right now... i'm planning on nyc from the 2nd weekend in aug to 3rd weekend in aug.  i need to get tix soon... before the jetblue fare sale ends.  have you heard about this  urlLink ken jennings  guy?  he's frickin ridiculous.  he's on is 22nd or something consecutive win.  he's got over $700k in winnings.  he's from utah.  wtf?  stocham... kris... what's up with that?  why are all you utah people freaks of nature?  j/k.  but seriously... that guy is amazing.  he's super quick too.  i'm still working on the previous question when he buzzes in and answers the current question.  i'm gonna get me an orange seat and a gold seat.  there are plans to  urlLink auction  off the contents of the old aud downtown.  i have a fondness for the old nosebleed oranges.  i remember seeing many a game downtown in that arena built during the depression as a public works project.  one by one all the old landmarks are being taken down.  only the front facade is left of the old war memorial stadium on the east side... and now... it looks like memorial auditorium is going to be turned into a bass pro and hotel.  ahhh yes... the oranges... $15 a game... i'll put the seat in front of a tv and pretend that i'm still sitting in the aud for a sabres game.  ok... on to chem lab.

      80 degrees... blue skies and sunny.  i'm gonna head down to niagara square in a few with jay, jill, and a couple other people... juliet dagger's playing @ 5, ben folds is playing @ 6.  i hope tomorrow stays dry enough to enjoy the afternoon.  tansal gets in then... and kris may have some free time.  there are only 2 places that we need to hit-up... anderson's and duffs.  other than that... maybe we'll just wander around... walk around delaware park... go to the waterfront... check out the ani difranco/goo goo dolls show... or whatever.  i'm just hoping the weather cooperates so that buffalo makes a good impression on its visitors... that's really all i'm asking for.  there's a link to the petition over on the right sidebar... in case it gets archived off the front page... it'll be easier to find.  if i don't have time to write tomorrow... enjoy your bbqs and ice cream... and summer food... enjoy all the freedom and choice you have by just being here.  HAVE A SAFE AND HAPPY 4TH EVERYONE!!

      i won't say anything else except that it gets the gdab seal of approval.  if you have some free time and some extra cash lying around... see it before you hear anything (more) about it.  i think you'll enjoy it twice as much.  i was driving down klein rd.  someone hit a skunk... the carcass was lying in the middle of the street... had to swerve so i wouldn't get skunk on my tires.  those things smell rancid... the odor seeped into the car... had to open up the windows for a couple minutes while driving home.  clear night... full moon... nothing like these kinda nights for a drive down the I-990.  no cops... never any cars on it... just open highway... running through north amherst... a couple curves along the way... and you're just gone.  night!

      on petition online... here's the  urlLink petition ... if you enjoy mister softee as many people do, and you feel good when you hear him down the street in nyc during the warm months, please feel free to sign.  hopefully i'll be able to collect a good amount of signatures and be able to send the link to the city council.  here's a  urlLink moron ... it's an older story... but it's still ridiculous.  i wonder if she would've been too scared to use her toilet in her home if the same thing happened in her in her own bathroom?  i should create a petition to ban stupid people... anyone want to sign that?  more  urlLink idiots ...  Prince said low-carb diets that advocate piling on the animal protein and fat are "increasing the risk of developing cancer, heart disease, stroke, type-2 diabetes and other chronic diseases." best  urlLink soup  in the world... i need to hit up these places in china.  if i'm going to be a pharmacist... i need to know how these drugs work... i have a legal obligation to be knowledgable and inform my clients/patients about drugs and stuff right?  this is why i'm afraid of the  urlLink south ... i was actually just talking to aaron about it last night.  how do you "forget" to take segregation laws off the books for a couple decades?  ok... that's all for now... gonna go catch spiderman 2 with jill later.  yay long weekend!

      it's been awhile since i've had strawberry cream cheese.  i've just rediscovered it recently.  it's been going on my bagel that i toast in the morning before i go to chem class.  it's yummy and tasty.  in fact, i could probably eat it for all my meals.  i tend to do that a lot... go through phases where i overdo or over-consume things... and i get bored... move on... and come back a little later when by chance i rediscover it (which isn't very hard... since i can always eat... that's how i also rediscovered john & mary's chicken finger sub medium hot sauce with bleu cheese!!).  speaking of which... witch... switch... twitch... eh... yeah... which... i haven't had mighty in a long time.  perhaps it's time to rediscover that.  kris & t.c. are coming to buffalo this weekend!  time for fun!

      can i just say... damn... it feels good to not have classes for awhile.  i can't even believe it's almost mid august though... i spent the last 3 months studying... it's the first summer in a long time that i haven't done anything summerish by now.  i have a lot of catching up to do before the leaves start falling.  it's been pretty cool here lately... 60's and stuff as the daytime high... i don't mind... i like the cooler weather.  light sweater weather is the best... it's comfortable to sleep in @ night.  i've been wearing my canada zip-up roots hoodie that alex gave me.  umm... jah.  so this organization  urlLink artspace  has been in  urlLink discussion  with the city of buffalo to create an art-space.   Artspace Projects, a national, nonprofit organization, is working with the City of Buffalo, New York to study the creation of a major, multipurpose arts facility in Buffalo, which would include space for arts organizations and other businesses as well as affordable living and working space for artists and their families. sounds cool... i hope they get to rehab and reuse some of the old brick buildings downtown.  the potential for successful reuse of many buildings is there... it'll be nice that this organization is looking to move on that potential.  as long as people are jumping in... i think that gives others more confidence to take a chance and jump in on their own projects and developments.  it'd be nice if we could reach a point here... where that's self-sustainable, and government won't always need to step in to make things happen.  hillary clinton (and chuck schumer) is/are awesome.  i have to give props to both... as they seem to be aware that there's more to new york state than nyc.  so it turns out they've done some research and hashed out a  urlLink proposal  for a regional county government.  the proposal would dissolve the city of buffalo, and setup a county run government.  i hope people vote 'yes'... it makes sense.  right now, the city is pitted against the suburbs vying for businesses... and businesses aren't hesitating on asking local governments what tax breaks and amneties they can get if they relocate across town and city lines.  i feel we need a one central regional government that controls all these deals that go on... and one central body that plans for the region.  we've spent far too long fighting and competing between neighbors... instead of working together to benefit the local area.  maybe in the future... if this ends up working out well... we can merge niagara county in as well... and maybe even out to rochester and monroe county.  the more that we are a unified bloc... the better we can counter downstate and all our tax dollars that get funneled down there.   urlLink this  makes me sad.  i met a lot of interesting, and smart people during these last couple years... and many have moved on to other industries.  though silicon valley was a total sausage area... i think it would've been cool to have worked and experienced life out there for a little bit at least.  i always looked on in amazement while sitting in a car and driving down some of the main roads... as buildings with the names and logos of apple, oracle, google, hp, sun, all passed by.

       "I don't think Kerry's ready to be president," said Laura Weber, a 37-year-old Republican from Pierre, S.D. "Bush would be more decisive." excerpted from this  urlLink article .  ????  what?  just because a person is decisive is not a reason he/she should be president.  i know the quote was just a clip and all, and could very well be taken out of a larger well thought out argument... but if the ONLY reason this woman thinks bush would make a good president is that he SEEMS to be more decisive... then it's a terrible argument.  people can be decisive and make bad decisions... which i think the bush administration has plenty of them.  being president REQUIRES a person and their administration to make the BEST decision in the face of ALL information gathered.  being president REQUIRES that person's administration to check and thoroughly recheck information to make sure it's right, and after that point make the BEST decision.  the fed are not going to move on interest rates unless they have jobs, unemployment, gdp, trade, cpi, ppi, etc., stats.  if we do all of that for money, shouldn't we get the best and most correct data for something like a military campaign when the lives of our fellow americans are on the line?  obviously the length of time a decision will be made on certain issues will vary from person to person... but the important point is that we make the BEST decision... sure... it's a judgement call... but what i'm trying to get across is... rash decisions are not the same as good decisions.  kerry WILL have to make decisions as president... i don't think kerry will make as many quick decisions as bush, but why is that bad if they're the CORRECT (read best) ones?   "I'm not going to be satisfied until everybody who wants to work can find a job," Bush told cheering supporters at a picnic in New Hampshire. taken from this  urlLink article .  well then i guess bush will NEVER be satisfied.  no matter how hard anyone tries, there will never be 100% employment... i guess not unless we move to a complete command economy (aka communism and various forms of socialism).  there will always be people that can't find jobs in a capitalist market.  even if everyone did have a job... yes... i feel like i'm beating the type of job issue to death... but if you were making $40k/year as a business analyst, were laid off, continued to want a job as an analyst, but you end up being a grocery bagger for minimum wage (ie you still WANT a job)... is that acceptable?  global trade... free trade is NOT bad.  the  urlLink wto  is NOT bad.  there are things that might be wrong with the system, but conceptually... why is it bad to get things cheaper?  why do americans LOVE shopping @ wal-mart and yet they'll (people other than the workers.  ie people with 2nd hand experience) protest wages that wal-mart pays the workers?  simple business sense would dictate that the more costs you have... the more you'll have to find a way somehow to cover them.  being that wage costs are the main costs to a retail business that are self-adjustable... if wages go up, something has to make up for it on the revenue side.  the major revenue variable revenue stream is product pricing... thus prices for items would need to go up.  in the case of US farming... i think our subsidies for farmers are way too much.  why subsidize for a system that overproduces by so much?  our supply greatly exceeds the demand for farm products... which means the price should be very low for us right?  unfortunately the government props up these industries by installing a price floor, so not only do we as consumers pay more than we have to... we pay for product that we don't even consume (at the supermarket checkout and through taxes).  why the waste?  why can't we return the market to equilibrium naturally?  why can't we use tax dollars for something more productive like education credits for farmers whose farms would fold if we did set that industry free?  in the long run... that would benefit more.  or... another way to think of it... if you're a farmer (i know in my head farming is difficult work... not first hand... but i know it's more difficult than what most people imagine) and you work your farm 24x7 putting in those long days... and in the end the product of your work is not being used up... but instead wasted... what does that say about the time you put into producing that product?  from a personal perspective... is it time well spent?  we are a nation of over-producers and over-consumers... we have that luxury... but we waste SO much... and we overpay for waste.  i wish our politicians would stand up against waste more than anything else... i think in the end... a lot of problems domestically and internationally that we face stem from us over-consuming and wasting things.  jetblue is  urlLink awesome .  i'm glad they're growing and doing well.  they're planes are comfortable, their service is exceptional, and their prices are cheap.  i lucked out when they first launched... as the new york-buffalo route was an initial route... for a few months they had i think like $25-$30 one-way fares on the route.  $50-$60 roundtrip... i was so on that... especially being a poor college student.  within the last year or so... they reconfigured their planes to give you extra legroom in the rear plane seats.  people in the rear are usually the last ones to get off.  this makes sense i think... cause sometimes in the past i'd be disappointed if i didn't get a seat in the front of the plane... but if i had extra legroom... that's something i can at least take comfort in that the front seated people didn't have (frickin jerks).  i try to get seats mid-plane now... legroom & decent deboarding time... nice compromise.  brett hull (the non-goal scorer) signed with  urlLink phoenix ...  Hull, drafted by Calgary in the sixth round in 1984, has played for the Flames, St. Louis, Dallas and Detroit. He won Stanley Cups with the Stars (1999) and Red Wings (2002), scoring the cup-winning goal for Dallas in a triple-overtime Game 6 victory against Buffalo. WHAT?!  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! (think of the 'NOOO!' from mcbain on the simpsons).  the article forgot to add that his skate was in the crease... thus technically nullifying the goal because of the RULES of the game at that time, which promptly were changed the next season.  you know... that was perhaps the best game-winning NON-goal that i've ever seen.  das war eine grosse hasselhoff... eine grosse scheisse.  das ist alles fuer jetzt...

      so... i was a bit worried about this last test... but... i came out feeling better than both my previous tests.  the only question that i didn't outright know and had to try and make an educated guess on was on isomers & geometric isomers of an organic compound.  everything else was good... and the only reason i think i would've gotten anything else wrong is if i messed up a J/kJ conversion of g/kg conversion... but i made sure to double check everything.  i also didn't run out of time like the last 2 tests.  hopefully i'll have done well enough to get a decent grade in the course.  so i've been saving up some articles i thought were interesting...  so... bush has proposed a  urlLink change  to labor laws that is interesting.  it's actually an idea that i like and agree with, on certain conditions.  the first being, that this new law does not get rid of overtime.  some people like overtime and some other depend on overtime to pay the bills etc.  i do like the choice i'd be able to have of using overtime as flex-time though.  if i worked 60 hours a week one week... it'd be nice to know that i could take 2 days off the next week if i so choose to.  i can see how the afl-cio would be against it, i think they are worried that cutting overtime will be the beginning to a shift of power towards business and make it easier for them to exploit workers by refusing overtime.  pluses and minuses... but with the right bill i think it could benefit both sides.  it's all in how you spin it...  so the bush people are touting the number of jobs created so far... and how jobless claims have  urlLink dropped  (because of the bush tax cuts of course).  while i've already wrote about how supply side economics work... and i'm not going to say that tax cuts don't work, i still don't believe tax cuts are the best way to stimulate an economy experiencing such a drawn out slump.  it's just not sustainable... and all the while that these cuts are being made, services to people and organizations that need government funding are left to struggle a bit more.  so in this next article... we see that payroll growth has  urlLink slowed  down... bringing into question the sustainablity of the economic "rebound".  if you've noticed in the past couple weeks there've been reports about the types of jobs the economy is creating... many of which are in lower wage service jobs.  while they are jobs being created... i wouldn't go so far as to say our economy is moving forward ("turning the corner" as bush would say) because of the increase in people delivering pizzas.  unfortunately a "job" isn't really always a job when it comes to economic growth.  while we're on the topic of tax cuts... we've broken a  urlLink record  by the tune of $422 billion!  it's too bad it's not a $422 billion surplus... rather a giant deficit... brought to us by none other than "Texas" himself.  i wonder what would happen, if we really messed with texas?  good idea though... let's decrease our revenue and increase our defense spending... and hope that when our nation's currency is devalued we'll somehow magically have the funds to pay for everything.  smart... and he went to business school where?  harvard?  hmmm... maybe they teach another kind of business @ harvard business school?  when i last checked... it was good to have your revenues exceed your costs... not the other way around.  if bush/cheney and kerry/edwards were to fight... who would win?  maybe we'll find out if they keep campaigning in the  urlLink same  towns.  i'd put my money on kerry/edwards... they have the smarts and youth on their side.  cheney might not even be able to make it to the fight... given his health... and for some reason... bush's 'bama guard credentials don't seem too intimidating.  go  urlLink john mccain .  it's nice to know there are people in government who no matter what their party allegiance is will call people from their own party out and tell them to shut up.  is it true that kerry served his country and later disagreed with it?  yes... but the important fact is... kerry served his country... it was a conscious choice... how do you argue with that?  a good opinion  urlLink piece  on teresa heinz kerry.  like donn esmonde i find women with qualities like teresa heinz kerry intriguing... and attractive.  they won't take crap... and they'll stand up to anything.  if a woman is the comforting supportive person in a relationship that is is good... but not all the time.  even i know that sometimes i'll need a kick in the ass cause i'm being ridiculously dumb.   urlLink this  was upsetting to me.  race relations in the country have progressed... but... not to the extent that people throw race out the window and live together harmoniously.  i'd like to think that eventually we'll get there however long it may take.  what happened to "all men are created equal"?  yes at the time the statement was written it was inferred that 'all men' = caucasian, but we're supposed to be over that... aren't we?  we are the standard that other free nations look to... we have to set a good example... and right now... we aren't doing a very good job... domestically or internationally.  somewhat encouraging  urlLink signs  of slow path to racial income equality.  it's good that the other races in the US feel they have disposable income (di) to increase their overall spending.  while this report doesn't go too in depth with the break downs of stats such as net income... at least it's encouraging to know that di has seemingly gone up for minority groups which i guess would infer that they had greater income than before.  and lastly for links... here's some  urlLink funny  brought to you by will ferrell and ACT, i found from this  urlLink post  on gothamist.  someone remind me to get some jamba juice when i'm in new york.

         so apparently, the  info   was 3 years old, can't say i'm surprised, election ploy?&nbsp; very good  possibility... but i can't say that i hope it isn't... cause if there's been  increased activity that's not so&nbsp;good either.&nbsp;&nbsp;looked at it  from&nbsp;both ways... it's&nbsp;not a&nbsp;situation i like.      &nbsp;    spencer tunick's doing a nekkid  installation  @  buffalo's old central terminal.&nbsp; i was wavering on doing this... when i  first heard about it... it seemed like a cool&nbsp;crazy thing to do for the  hell of it... but i'd be bare... like in a bad dream, i'm sure it would've been  ok in the end though.&nbsp; my decision was made for me when i booked my trip to  new york before they announced when the art was going to be made, and it ended  up being scheduled for the time that i would be in new york.      &nbsp;    you have to love the  doom   series of games... and id software.&nbsp; these guys revolutionized computer  games... i still remember wolfenstein on a 386dx/33 with 4 megs ram... the  blazingly fast system at the time.&nbsp; games have come a long way since  w3-d.      &nbsp;    and finally... it's been awhile since i've read one  of my favorite columnists in the onion... so i went over to  the onion  and did a search for...  smoove  b .&nbsp; always cracks me up.      &nbsp;    out.

      some songs can show up and define certain moments in a person's life.  i was just listening to navy blues... and iggy & angus took its turn.  i think i'll always associate i&a with going to see sloan with alex @ the bowery... i'm pretty sure it was his first sloan show that i dragged him to... i think i just told him to come... cause it was going to be a good show, he blindly followed my advice (which is always good btw =]).  it was kinda still hot/warm in the city as we walked down from 26th... so it probably was in the beginning of sophomore year.  the reason i&a=alex is i think that may have been the tightest song they played that show (imo)... kicked it up a couple notches... the place was jumpin... and alex came out a changed man.  i'm pretty sure they came around again... sometime in the late fall to middle of winter?  cause i remember colleen came up from virginia and i had gotten tix for her b-day or v-day to the show... anyhow by that time... i had already converted alex into a canadian music junkie.  though stocham has disappointed in many ways over the years (too numerous to list, but thank god for laura or the list would be twice as long)... that is perhaps one of my greatest accomplishments.  alex, we seriously need to hit up a street fair... get some sassage and softee asap.    Iggy & Angus , Sloan  Someone better get insurance  To take good care of me  'Cause if I'm stuck with my own bad luck  Well, that's the saddest sight you'll see   'Cause if I stumble, then I fall, and get back up  Try to brush the dust off  And everything is black when I close my eyes  I lose all sense of time   It hurts, it's cruel, but it feels real good  I'm going to do it after all   We're still the same  After all these years  It's funny how you get a feel for it  When you finally lose your sense of fear   When Iggy said it's loose down on the street  Living in the city  And everything went black 'cause it's in my eyes  Everything denied   Kurt's still cool and Angus rules  I'm gonna plug it in again   We're still the same  After all these years  It's funny how you get a feel for it  When you finally lose your sense of fear   Someone better get insurance  To take good care of me  'Cause if I'm stuck with my own bad luck  Well, that's the saddest sight you'll see   It hurts, it's cruel, but it feels real good  Well that's all right  Kurt's still cool, and Angus rules  And that's all right  All right

      i'm not yet supposed to give up my technology empire just yet.  i was just recommended to update another website... i need to touch base with the owner in the coming days/week or so.  most of my friends can attest to the fact that i'd be quite happy as an IT consultant with my own firm.  the hard part is stringing along a bunch of work... so i don't go incomeless for 3/4 of the year.  i liked doing server/desktop and network setups on the side in new york... it required a certain amount of creativity... thinking... and skill to deliver within the client's budget... plus it was good money... more per hour than i made with my real job.  the problem was standing out from all the other millions of individual consultants and consulting firms of large and small sizes.  i had a decent base of customers i guess for someone who did it on the side... and just starting... but if i wanted to grow... i'd really have to just jump out and do it... which was quite frightening.  it just seemed like... i had already been sidetracked by so many other events over the last 8 years... i didn't want to take the risk... perhaps i should've... perhaps i'll hold onto it and see where i end up.

      today capped a week in which there was a lot of big news from friends...  first off... i'd like to congratulate R&S as they are now officially engaged.  good setup by R too... central park lake, rowboat... nice.  so i guess theirs is going to be the first wedding of a close high school friend that i'll be going to (unless someone decides to pull a tricky sneaky and puts theirs ahead).  and then... i'm gonna have another niece or nephew again... well... surrogate niece or nephew.  congrats to m&k.  i need to work on being closer to friends that have kids... or are going to have kids.  i want to be the cool uncle... and spoil my friend's kids.  so i'm excited for all four of you guys... and happy... and i give you all good vibes.  yet again...  urlLink people  giving christianity a bad name.   "I'm glad I didn't carry my gun. I'd probably be in jail right now." Rocco said. "I believe in the Ten Commandments and I don't appreciate what people like him are doing to my country." yes... it's your country... but it's also close to 300 million other people's country as well.  so what you're saying is... you're the only one that matters?  nice... pretty selfish of you wouldn't you say?  how very christian of you to shoot someone and go to jail.  this country may have been built on the fundamentals of christianity... but the fundamentals of christianity also allow an individual the freedom to choose what your beliefs are (they can be judged right or wrong by God, but the consequences rest on the individual who chooses).  why do conservative christians still not understand that second point?  you all realize we're paying the consequences now for these few right?  very very  urlLink cool .  i hope we continue stem cell research in the future... it could benefit people tremendously.  new york's on heightened  urlLink alert  after some new intelligence was gathered.  for the most part i believe it... but if this ended up coming out 40 years later to be a ploy to get bush reelected playing on the fear of the public i wouldn't be surprised either.  so... what did bush say a few days ago?  'we've turned the corner'?  or something to that extent right?  not according to this  urlLink link  on our gdp, and this  urlLink link  on job growth.  i'm under the belief that growth from tax cuts are not sustainable... it's like a coupon... a one time break that may increase spending in the short term... but having gone through a long period of a recession and then a stagnation of the economy like we have... it will not be a sustainable uptick.  we've already tried supply side economics under reagan... it didn't work... why... WHY on earth would we try it again?  thanks for add to the national debt mr. bush.  thanks for creating burger flipping jobs for people with skills and experience in other industries i'm sure they're thrilled about it... is this really how we're going to grow our country?  nice work!  then there's the mba degree... this thing always fluctuates... not surprisingly with business in general.  i still think it's a valuable degree if combined with the right background... i'm still planning on getting one sometime in the future... i think it's one thing that i am sure about... i'm still leaning more towards the management information systems side of it instead of the straight up management.  though i need to get through this i don't know phase first.  and... seagate is  urlLink awesome .  they just reupped their warranty period of their drives from a measly industry matching of 1-year... up to 5-years.  there was a period when industry average was 3-years... that was as recently as my sophomore year @ nyu... then sometime between then and the recent past, warranties went down to 1-year.  good to see seagate buckin the trend... i think it also says something about their products if they're willing to put themselves out like this.  i commend them for doing it.  5 more days... then 6 more days... i be gone!

      let's start with canada first...  urlLink leng  has some  urlLink pics  of quebec city which i really like... it's got me wanting to go... i've never been to quebec city.  maybe i'll roadtrip next summer before or after a trip to asia?  ontario to prince edward island?  it's been a long time since i've been up to nova scotia and new brunswick.  i want to buy a house in the canadian maritime provinces when i'm older... it's peaceful... and serene... and scenic.  courtesy of  urlLink tansal ... a post and a link to an article on how orchestras around the country are now  urlLink performing  howard shore's lord of the rings orchestral score.  there's been large demand for tickets to these concerts, maybe the  urlLink buffalo philharmonic  will perform it sometime... i'd very much like to hear the score live.  i have to say... i don't think i've ever heard a better movie score... what shore does... down to the intricate details and instruments, added so much to the movie, especially in the theaters with the dolby digital surround... it's pretty amazing it all came from one guy.  tonight i went and saw harold and kumar go to white castle.  i won't say much about it... except that i liked it... don't want to give too much away.  i'll post more about it in the next couple weeks... after people've had time to see it themselve and form their own thoughts on it.  i think that's all for now... oh... solaris 9 is on my unix/linux box... i've never seen gnome and xfree86 on it before... me like.  ok... happy august... night for real.
