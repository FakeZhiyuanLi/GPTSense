       Hm. I created this damn thing because it is 2 am and I have nothing better to do with my time. Besides that, everyone on msn got tired of me running my mouth to them. So I'll just ramble in here.    So, yeah. I'll introduce myself to..well I doubt anyone is reading this anyway but o well. I'm Aisys. I'm a very strange person. I'm obsessed with music such as Good Charlotte, Mest, NFG, AFI, Nirvana, Linkin Park, Switchfoot and some of that old country like George Jones. Music plays a huge role in my life. Normally when I'm down, I'll turn to my music. It keeps me from doing a lot of crazy shit. By some, I'm considered a "freak." By others I can be considered a great friend. Although freak fits more than often. Most people don't like me that much. I speak my mind and I'm very opinionated. I'm not afraid to tell people how I feel or to stand up for what I believe in. I'm very loyal to my friends, I'll stand up for them against anyone. I'm very emotional, too. I have my "moods" where I'm upset and depressed, I have those alot. Every so often, I'll have my hyper stages, they don't last too long. Unless I'm pissed off, or in one of those moods, I'm just in a blah state. I'm not really mad or upset or happy, just-blah. When I'm pissed off, I wouldn't recomment messing with me. I'm not a bitch. I am THE bitch.   Yeah..that's me. I can't think of anything to say but if I do later I'll put it up.

      This world is so fucked up. I don't understand why all this shit happens. My aunt, who was my sister, my best friend, the person who I was closest to for a long time, was murdered last year. Her killer still walks free. We all know that it was her boyfriend, Ed, or his psyco siter, Yvonne.  Yet the cops sit on their ass instead of getting some evidence to fucking charge them. Its been way too long.    They were going to marry. He said that he loved her, if he loved her as much as he said did, then why in the fucking blue hell is he covering for himself and/or his fucking sister? He told us he saw a fucking van..showed me what kind of van it was, tried to get me to believe him. At the time, I probably did believe what he told me. I didn't want to believe that him--this man that Twylia loved could have anything to do with her death. Maybe I was wrong. Then Yvonne and her fucking stories. I never did like her. I never believed a word she said. Her latest story that she woke up in the back of the car when it was all over. Bull-fucking-shit. No one believes her silly ass.     I don't know what to believe anymore.  I don't know anything. Remember, I'm just a kid.  What I think doesn't matter. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, they don't listen to me.  Twylia Dawne Walls had just turned 21 when she was murdered. She had turned 21 on April 26, 2003. She was killed May 15, 2003.  Nothing has been done about this.  But if you think that I and the rest of her family and friends and everyone that loved her ( and thats a whole lot of fuckin people, let me tell ya) are just going to sit around and wait for nothing to happen, you don't know me too well. I'm gonna raise hell. I'll throw a fucking hissy fit,(not that I haven't already.) Twylia was my best-friend, I miss her so much. I cry everyday knowing that she's gone, and she never got the chance to live her life. I will make sure something is done about this. If I have to kill the bastard myself--something will be done. Yeah, I maybe just a kid, but like I said, I'm a bitch, I'll make sure something happens.  Life is Beatiful, but short. Live it to the fullest!~Jane Walls  In Loving Memory of Twylia Dawne Walls. April 26, 1982-May 15, 2003.  No Farewell Words Were Spoken No Time To Say Goodbye, You Were Gone Before We Knew It and Only God Knows Why.

      Once again--I have nothing better to do with my time. So here are some random thoughts of mine or whatevers on my mind at the moment.  Has anyone else ever wondered why smilies don't have hair?! I certainly do. I think its kinda strange...maybe I'm the only one who thinks so.   Something else you (whoever you are. prolly no one) should know about me. I'm one of those crazy people. The "cutters." "Sick puppies" as others have called us. Yes, I cut myself. I don't think anyone besides the cutters themselves, and sometimes not even them, truly understand why one would harm themselves like that. Cutting is also addictive for some. It seems, after the first time you try it, next time your in that emotional state, you feel the urge to do it again, sometimes not even when your upset just any ole time. You feel like you "need" to cut.  For me, cutting is an outlout for all my anger, frustration, pain, sadness or whatever type of emotion I'm feeling at the moment, that has become too overwhelming. It's a way to "numb" the pain, "bleed the pain," or "kill the pain."  When I cut, it calms me tremendously. It eases the emotional pain. As I read back over this, its still exactly what I wanted it to say.  I can't even describe the exact reason why I cut. I guess that's just something you can't understand unless you experience it yourself. Yes, I do know that cutting is dangerous and stupid. Don't think I haven't been told a few hundred times. By my parents, my friends, my school councelor, my therapist, my principal, my teachers, and a few odd people that found out. I realize how I should find some way else to vent my anger. I've tried other ways. I've tried popping myself with a rubber band when I felt the urge to cut. It isn't enough. I've also thought that since if I do cut-people would see the scars. So I tried other forms of SI. (SI- self-injury). I tried burning myself. It wasn't enough. I tried pinching myself hard with my nails. That wasn't enough. Banging my head against a wall, or concrete. That doesn't quite do it either. I also tried to do other things instead of SI. I tried writing, to get my feelings out. But the whole reason why I'm that angry or upset, is because I don't know how to put my feelings into words. So the writing didn't work. It just made me angrier that I couldn't.  Calling a close friend helps. But, normally when I'm in that state, its late at night and my phone has already been taken away and I doubt that their parents would appreciate a 3 am phone call from me. I've tried screaming into a pillow--its way too loud.  Before I started to SI, I'd listen to my music. Music plays a huge role in my life as I've said before. When I was in the state, I'd go to my room, and blast my music. Then my 'rents got the lovely idea that they should take my stereo from me. No more music. Although I still had a small one and my portable one, I couldn't get that loud music that I needed.  Crying actually helps alot. Just to lay on my bed, or underneath my desk (which is in the corner so its a great hiding spot) and cry for hours. That would help, although I don't have that kind of time to spend. I'd have about 10 minutes max before mother or father come yelling at me to get my ass out of my room, lose the attitude and quit being a bitch. Yeah. Very supoortive parents, eh?   I'm a freak. *whoo* Yeah, most people that know me consider me a freak. I wear mostly black. Band tees and whatnot. I wear dark eye makeup. I listen to different types of music than everyone else. I like different things than they, and I'm also considered a bitch. I think the latest news I've heard about me was that I'm a "gothic bitch." Oh yeah, did you also know that I worship the devil and I'm going to hell? Or that I'm a witch and I put spells on peopel at school? Really? Neither did I. Someone informed me of this the other day. Isn't that interesting how someone you hardly ever talk to knows more about you than you do? Oh well I guess. That's not the first time I've been accussed of worshiping the devil. People have even asked one of my close friends if I do.
