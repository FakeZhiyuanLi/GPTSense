      What I really like about  urlLink Alton Brown's  show, "Good Eats", is the way he turns  urlLink roasted duck  into a science class on the first law of thermodynamics.    While I love to cook, I'm not one to follow recipes, but having a better understanding of the chemical reaction that occurs when I torch the cr&#232;me br&#251;l&#233;e or caramelize onions makes me feel like I'm more responsible for the quality of the end product.    Kind of like how knowing that crunch you hear when you step on a beetle is the chitin that comprises his shell.

      It's kind of pathetic when I'm actually glad it's a rainy Monday and I'm back at work, dealing with (what's come to be) the usual chaos.  Like having a call scheduled in an hour and a half where I'm supposed to review the clone of our development database, which has yet to be rebuilt for me, which means I can't go in and clean it up prior to the call, which means I get to spend half of the call reminding our consultant that he doesn't need to worry about half of the crap in there...  Don't get me wrong -- my weekend was good.  80 degrees and sunny and it only took one Claritin per day to keep my allergies under control.  And I finally got around to my spring cleaning.  And although I'm not  urlLink dating my ex-boyfriend , I did join him for mimosas on Sunday, which was nice.  Except...  ...for the fact that I didn't interpret "I'm meeting Ben and his buddies for a few drinks later" to mean "Ben's setting me up with some blonde", so when Peach and I finished dinner and headed over to E for a couple beers, we sat next to them.    At least it was free entertainment.

      Work has  urlLink sucked  for the past week.    And it's supposed to be better.  But it's not. Every time I turn around, there's another problem.  And they're not all mine.  But I feel like I have to make sure they get fixed.  And it has turned me into a very crabby person. I'm not very good company right now - I'm even getting on my own nerves.   And tonight is dinner with my mother and aunt. That should just about finish me.    I need a beach and the sun and a cabana boy to keep my drink fresh...

      (or "How to amuse a geek for hours")  I've been playing with one of the features on  urlLink Google Labs .   urlLink Google Sets  will automatically create sets of items based on the examples you enter.  So I tried it.  And, I tried to stump it (because I'm the type of person who enjoys  breaking things  a challenge).  Here's what Google told me:  If there were additional members of the Beatles, one of them would be named  urlLink "Volkswagen" .   It recognized that Purdue, Indiana, Ball State, and Notre Dame were universities in the state of Indiana and provided me with a list of other Indiana-based universities.   Chianti, Sauvignon Blanc, and Merlot stumped the "small set" search, and the "large set" contained several countries.  I'd hate to drink a bottle of Greece.   I really need to get a life...

      My typical Sunday:    Wake up, brush teeth, pull back hair, throw on enough clothing to be seen in public.  Pick up a paper and grab a cup of coffee at Starbuck's (I know, I could get the paper delivered and make my own coffee -- and I used to -- but that led to me not making myself presentable until late in the day, as well as encouraging me to drink an entire pot of coffee...).  Read paper, cut out coupons, glance at an ad or two.  Make a mimosa and tackle the LA Times crossword puzzle.  Consider meeting someone for brunch, or being productive, or officially starting my day.  Or maybe take on the NY Times puzzle and another mimosa...  Today is NOT my typical Sunday.

       This morning, dear Gemini, you could look around and see nothing but piles of papers that you have no use for at this time. Therefore you might just go through them like a house afire, wanting to clear out as much clutter as you can. This is always good, as a cluttered house parallels a cluttered mind. However, make certain you at least scan something before discarding it. You don't want to throw something out you may need later. How appropriate...  That's what I have planned for the weekend.

      So - work sucks today.  We're trying to launch our e-mail preference program tomorrow and finalize the project plan for our content management system migration (so work can begin next week).  Not only can I not give my full attention to both today, I can't imagine how any of us will get the tasks completed for the CMS project in time.  According to the plan, Ben will have to work 176 hours one week in April...  And Microsoft Project's "resource leveling" feature makes absolutely NO sense.  Not to mention I couldn't sleep last night.  At all.  I could barely keep from yawning at 9:30, and by the time I was home, changed, and watching the news, I was wide-awake.  And stayed that way.  All night.  Until I fell asleep and was rudely awakened 10 minutes later by a car alarm.  Busiest day at work this year on top of no sleep whatsoever.  Perfect.

      Recent topics of conversation (just a typical night at E...) (guest blogged by Peach – and elaborated upon by me)  1. snorting 	 Brenda (a.k.a. "Mom") – probably in reaction to one of the following conversations.  2. farting 	 Again Mom – although it wasn’t witnessed by anyone except Mark (thanks for sharing).  3. sex, moving parts (lubricating oil) 	 Who said you can’t learn while you drink?  This is one of the benefits of playing trivia.  The question:  “Lubricating oil is used for:”? Mark’s answer “sex, sex, sex!”  The answer that won points: “moving parts”.  Although that should include sex…  4. coochie  This would be where Peach’s tattoo is NOT  5. clean your box  Brenda’s an anti-germ freak.  Subsequently, we all get our boxes (trivia game playmakers – get your mind out of the gutter) cleaned with an anti-bacterial towelette.  Works great on cell phones too.  6. don't touch my box  And I mean it.  7. "did i hear you say spread"  Funny how a bartender can’t hear a request for a menu, or another drink, or the tab, but from 15 feet away, clearly hears a conversation not intended for his ears…  8. 6, 7, no, 8"  From Mr. Measurementally challenged.  9. Lance Armstrong's crotch  In reference to the “Mr. Texas” tattoo on his arm – which I’ve never noticed, as most media attention is on his crotch.  Although Peach seems fixated by his chest…  10. fuck it, it works  Becoming the motto of the masses.  and last, but not least…  11. "rock on"... the Dude  Seriously, Dude said "rock on" at least 4 times in the 30 second conversation I had with him.  Maybe 6.

      So I added comments and trackback yesterday and somehow lost all of my template edits from Friday.  Then I post this morning and lose the work I did yesterday.  I've added back the comments and changed the style sheet info and I'm waiting for the next thing to go wrong.  Or revert back to a previous state.    Good thing this doesn't happen in real life.  Or does it?

      (My apologies to Billy Joel...)  As most everyone who knows me is aware, I choose to spend  all  much of my leisure time at a sports bar.  It’s my own version of "Cheers", with the added bonus of trivia.  We'll call it "E".  Unfortunately, my friends and I are not always allowed to enjoy ourselves without the (most often) unwanted interruptions from other guests.  Highlights from this past weekend include the discovery that L and my trivia names are anagrams of “Cheap” and "Easy” and subsequent conversation that ended with the plan to film a Cheap and Easy adult film, and an offer by a misguided (but admittedly, adorable) waiter to allow one of us to “squirt the food out of his mouth”.    Past experiences have included offers of marriage, propositions by hotel guests, and the famous (but never on the menu) 7-inch sausage special offered time and again by yet another misguided (and measurementally challenged?) employee.  Fortunately, these experiences haven’t deterred from the enjoyment of E – where everybody knows my name (and it ain’t Easy).

      So, I'm grounded.  And I can't hope to get out of it, as I've grounded myself.  It's for my own good, though.  Growing up, I was only grounded once.  Kind of amazing, especially as it only lasted a few hours.  And I think I was asleep for those hours...  I believe as soon as I woke up the next day, I called a friend (no phone was one of my restrictions) and made plans to go over to her house (again, not allowed).  L has already made it clear that she and I are going out for our usual Friday evening tonight, to celebrate my "smurfdom".  I'm not half as excited about this as she is, as it's a wake-up call of sorts to say that in just over two years, I've amassed three million points playing trivia and drinking beer (wine, bourbon, vodka...).  So out tonight and grounded the rest of the weekend.  Unless, of course, I call a friend and invite myself over.  :)

      Scary, isn't it?          Linda is limegreen          Your dominant hue is green. You're logical and steadfast, focused on figuring life out and doing what makes sense. You value being trusted because you know you're taking the time to figure things out and everyone should just follow you.  Your saturation level is higher than average - You know what you want, but sometimes know not to tell everyone. You value accomplishments and know you can get the job done, so don't be afraid to run out and make things happen.  Your outlook on life is brighter than most people's. You like the idea of influencing things for the better and find hope in situations where others might give up. You're not exactly a bouncy sunshine but things in your world generally look up.         urlLink the spacefem.com html color quiz

      Sorry to once again prove to be the most boring blogger you know (but how many of you who know me actually  know  another blogger?...).  Anyway.  This week's gotten off to a bad start.  Well, not bad - slow.  My sinuses are killing me (again) because the pollen is out of control.  And when I've actually been at work (pulled a big 3-hour day Monday), this CMS project has me buried.    I think that's coming to an end, though.  Not the project, but the buried part.  Once I complete my templates, I'll only have to do my actual job, instead of my actual job AND the templates.   Should free up some time...    ...and I figure I can find plenty more trouble to get into if I only had more free time.  ;)

      Don't get me wrong - it's 80 degrees on a Saturday afternoon in the Music City, and I'm sure  someone  is enjoying it.  Supposed to have more storms tonight and tomorrow, though.  I'm trying to do too much at work today - I had thought I would define the templates for 6 sections of our site, but I'm going to settle for three.  I think my brain's overheated (or is that just because they turn off the AC over the weekends at the office?).  Iron Chef America is terrible. Not terrible like the version William Shatner hosted, but not Iron Chef. The hokiness of the show when it's actually filmed in Japan is part of what I like about it, but when it's here, it's just bad.  Soap opera bad. I think I'll pass on the three remaining shows...  Oh well, there's always tomorrow.  Sunday paper and mimosas...  :)

      OK - I was going to wait until I had a week or two of experience before making any judgments, but I just HAVE to share this:  When viewing a "conversation", or chain of an original e-mail and the replies, it displays in the order that the conversation happened!  So you can easily read it in order without having to go to the end of the message, read down to the bottom, scan up to the next reply, read down until you get to the start of the first item...  you get the idea.  ...and it allows you to collapse to view just the new part of any message in the conversation or expand it...  ...and, it automatically opens up the print dialogue box after opening the printer-friendly page...  ...and it's so easy to label messages so you can sort them by custom metadata properties rather than by throwing them in a directory...  ...and I'll contain the rest of my excitement until I take a week or two to evaluate.

      Why didn't I read this earlier? What's driving you today, dear Gemini? Why do you feel such an obsessive need to get all your work done at once? If you're trying to impress someone, there's no need for that. Others already hold you in high esteem. If the project you're working on is urgent, get some help. Don't try to do it all yourself - unless you want to be too stressed out to accomplish anything tomorrow! Talk about counterproductive! Relax!.

      I spent most of the day yesterday not able to see.  Well, being able to see, just not very well.  I didn't realize it until I came to work and tried to read an e-mail.    Twice during the day, I took my contacts out and rinsed them off and still couldn't read.  Then (11 hours later), I went to E to play trivia (gotta play Tuesday, you know).  And no matter how hard I squinted or leaned toward the television screen, I could not make out any of the questions or answers or clues.  Not one.    So, I thought that perhaps I had inadvertently put the incorrect lens in each eye.  And I went to switch them.  And I took out the left contact, and while it perched on my left index finger, I took out the right one.  And I looked and saw that the right one was actually two contacts.  So I looked back at the left one - and it was one.  After peeling the two contacts apart, I put one back in my right eye.  I know what I did.  I got up and put in my contacts and THEN showered, so when I got out of the shower, I saw a contact case lying next to the sink, and opened it up and put in my SPARE pair of contacts.  On TOP of the pair I had already put in.  And I didn't notice it when I took them out TWICE during the day to rinse them off with saline.  And, I didn't notice dropping one of the left lenses one of those times -- unless it's still in my eye...  I know, Peach - it's the blonde roots...

Some people, like me, are affected by that more than others.  People like you don't feel it because your system is better at processing the toxins.  But if you did this for even 10 days, you would feel a difference and have more energy.  Even things like chicken, steak and hamburgers (hormones in feed) and fruits and vegetables (pesticides) contribute.   -----Original Message----- From: Linda   Sent: Tuesday, April 20, 2004 1:54 PM To: Chris Subject: RE: Starvation Diet  If this starvation diet is so effective, why on earth would one have to do it several times a year???  -----Original Message----- From: Chris Sent: Tuesday, April 20, 2004 1:52 PM To: Linda Subject: Starvation Diet  Hey blogger.  Day 5 of the starvation diet as you call it.  Blood pressure normal - diastolic at 84 down from 136.  11 pounds weight loss.  Much better breathing but still need more improvement in the allergy department.  I am meeting someone tomorrow who does the diet several times a year and is well-educated on it, gonna ask if that technique is just as effective as 40 straight days, which seems like forever right now.     I figured with your vast experiences of being hit on that you would have found out a way to get rid of the guy at the bar who thinks he has a date in August;)

      Yesterday was Peach's birthday.  And we had fun...  for the most part.    Fun except for the fact that early on in the evening I had some guy decide that I'm the most interesting, beautiful, intelligent, funny woman on the face of the earth and he wouldn't leave my side all night.  Literally.  And he got to be incredibly annoying.  I'm not saying he was wrong ;), but he didn't seem to think that my opinion of him mattered in the equation.  We'll take care of that the next time (if there is a next time) I see him.  He thinks we have a date in August and will be waiting for me.  Somehow, I don’t doubt that.  Anyway, back on track.  Peach had a good day - she even got to take the afternoon off!  And after taking care of her errands and such, she checked her child (the furry four-legged type) into a doggy hotel and came to E and we got our own hotel room.  Knowing the only thing you have to drive home is an elevator can make for a crazy night.  Not stupid-crazy, like when one is in her twenties, but fun enough.  There were no shots or shooters or anything that would cause unnecessary pain and suffering the next day, but I managed to move quickly from beer to cider to wine to white Russians (dessert) without thinking twice.    And after a few helpings of dessert, Peach grabbed her balloons and we made it to the elevator and safely drove to the fifth floor.  I just hate that I left without getting my complimentary breakfast. We'll have to do it again in May!

      Recent observations from E:  No matter how much you may have liked the person sitting next to you yesterday or last week or whenever you last met, once enough alcohol has been consumed, that person will find your last nerve and stomp it to death.  You may or may not get over it by the next time you meet.  Hockey fans are more intelligent than football fans.  Hockey fans go home when the game is over.  "Seasoned fried potatoes" are french fries.  If you can't figure that out on your own, you don't deserve to eat.  If you are a hotel guest and you are talking to me and I do not respond to you in any manner, go away.  If I have to tell you to go away, please don't think I'll be offended if you call me a bitch.  If my brother happens to be here, watch out.  Although calling a bartender fat and slow may be truthful, it's really not nice.  Please say it behind his back...  He still manages to provide me with decent service and I'd like to keep it that way.  No matter how annoying the other guests (and employees) may get, this is still some of the best free entertainment one can find.  :)

      This week has seemed longer than usual, and I know it's not just work (although, my last true day off was when I went to the Preds game on April 3rd).  The weekend won't be any different.  Big bowling plans this evening (let's see if I can break 100), go to work tomorrow AM, get to E in time to get a seat for the game, meet up with friends afterwards, go home and crash, try to enjoy Sunday (that reminds me - stop on the way home Saturday PM for some orange juice...  I think I'm still ok with champagne), and maybe find some time to take care of myself...

      Well, at least my test results say I do...  Match.com has come out with two new attraction tests.  And although I'm not a match.com account holder, I was bored enough to give them a try.    The first test is all about physical attraction - and let me tell you, this HAS to be science...  Apparently, I'm attracted to "handsome men over 30" and those who are "clean shaven, have clear skin, and get good hair cuts."  And here I've been looking for some hideously deformed 24 year-old with stubbly, acne-ridden skin and dreads...  The other is a "personal attraction" test -- more of a personality assessment.  In addition to identifying my dazzling personality, my report went on to say: "You're a strong, honest, and deeply loyal woman. In a crisis, you're the one co-workers and friends come to for help. They know you'll give them straightforward, common sense advice. You can always be counted on to do what you say and say what you mean. You take pride in your work. In fact, at times this part of your life has pushed romance and fun to the "back burner." But you're not one to "settle" and so constantly strive to find balance in your life. You're not someone who "wears her heart on her sleeve" so even those closest to you don't always know how you feel. When someone special in your life invests the time to get to know you on a deeper level, they'll discover the more sensual and warm parts of your personality."  OK - I'm a workaholic who comes off as an ice queen...  Fair enough.   Other "highlights" of my report: "The organization and time-management skills that serve you so well in your career can spill over into your personal life and at times make you seem controlling and impatient."  "You're such a straightforward and honest woman that at times what you say comes across a little harsh and insensitive." Ouch.  Talk about harsh...  But overall, I have to admit that's not far off.  Although "at times" should be better defined.  Maybe "under extreme distress"...  Surprisingly enough, a whopping 4% of men are "very attracted" to my personality type.  Probably those who prefer to keep their women in a pit.  :)

      While I was out at the ball game Thursday, Peach got a  urlLink new ride .  So as soon as we got off work Friday, we had to go cruising.  Unfortunately, the rest of the weekend weather wasn't conducive to two cute girls picking up guys in a convertible, but there's always the rest of the summer.  :)  Preds struggled Saturday, but Detroit came to town Sunday looking for a fight, and an actual  urlLink hockey game  broke out.    I thought I had managed to avoid the uncomfortable family holiday scene, but Mom decided to show up to meet me for church Saturday night with her (soon to be ex) husband.  I decided to make a quick visit to see her Sunday after her guests left Easter dinner and before he got home from the game, to confirm nothing like that would happen again (and scored some homemade raisin bread and a bottle of wine in the process!).  I was incredibly spoiled yesterday morning, with coffee, the Sunday paper, breakfast, mimosas and a bag of Easter presents.  Peach went all out to celebrate her free day!  And all I did was show up.  Next time, we need the sun to come out so we can sit on the deck.  Monday morning, back at work (although I don't feel like I had much of a break) after fighting the rain and the three accidents I had to avoid to get here.  Five more days 'til the weekend...

      One of the things I've realized is that for me to entertain the  masses  five people who visit my blog, I must relate interesting experiences I have, comment on some current event out in the real world, or try to form my inner thoughts into a coherent discourse.  Problems:  Although I have had one or two interesting experiences lately, I'm not willing to share them --  you really don't think I'm going to reveal any deep secrets here, do you?  ;)  There are always current events/items of interest in the real world, but I don't have time to comment right now.  I'm stuck in IA hell for a while.  Hopefully not much longer.  If I HAD the time to comment on experiences, events or thoughts, it would by no means be coherent.    My brain is mush.  Mush is the value of metadata property state of said content object brain.  Context for that includes (but is not limited to) work, personal life, and family life (although I'm not sure what other types of "life" I have).

      ...madness, of course.  I have to admit I had a bad attitude about the entire tournament this year.  And it's definitely because IU wasn't in it.  At all.  I can deal with them going down in the first round (and we know they've certainly done that in the past), but knowing that they weren't good enough to go was too much.  I could have used ONE good thing in my life...  Congrats to UConn - they were my pick.  And even better that they eliminated Duke -- and the  urlLink team that beat IU  in the only game I've seen in 10 years...  There's always next year.   urlLink Maybe we'll get a new coach.  :)

      What I learned this weekend:   Being treated to a personal wine tasting is a benefit of being a VIP.  Going anywhere other than home afterwards is a bad idea.   Losing to St. Louis sucked.  Making the playoffs anyway doesn't.   Explaining to my mother why it's not unusual for her to find me at E at 8:15 PM wearing sunglasses at the bar is futile.  Having her return an hour and a half later to find me in the same state proves it.   Working on Sunday sucks.   Getting a free pass to skip out on the most convoluted family Easter dinner was just too easy.

      I don't know how it got to be the end of May already, but I have a feeling that work being as crazy as it has been the past few months has something to do with it.  We're scheduled to launch our new CMS/web site/rebrand on June 11th and even though it never seemed feasible, we're almost there.  Of course, I spent the past day and a half redefining the information architecture and content migration mapping I defined 2 months ago.  And I'm pretty much at a "wait for things to be ready so I can get more work done" place.  So, no working late until it's time to manually move the rest of the content to production, and no working this weekend, as I'll be at  urlLink the race , and get back after a long weekend to work non-stop for 11 days.  And then it's done.  :)  And we get to start phase 2...

Peach's Z hadn't been broken in yet, so we road-tripped it to Tunica last night, where I quickly showed her how easy it is to lose money in the casino.  But we had fun and befriended a bartender (imagine that...) and are willing to make another donation to the casino gods later today.  Then on to Memphis to the Pyramid to go to the "Wonders" exhibit.  We're so cultured, we may turn into yogurt.  ;)

      Spent the weekend at the  urlLink golf course  with Peach, at what will always be the Sara Lee LPGA tournament, no matter where it is or who sponsors it.  Kind of like how  urlLink Tom Selleck  will always be Magnum PI, even though the show is long over (as is his moustache)...  Started Sunday out with Mimosas and the paper at Peach's, then on to the golf course, where we had a very strategic day.  It's funny how just when we NEEDED a cart to take us to the other side of the course (or to the beer tent) one would appear.  We also got to practice our stealth maneuvers...  Peach to avoid her barfly, and I managed to not be sighted by my father.  It's funny how that childhood game of "if I don't look at you, you can't see me" seems to work.  :)  I ran into some of my old friends from the Sara Lee, and I think I agreed to be a captain at next year's tournament.  We were lucky enough to spend the afternoon in the Trophy Suite, with a bird's eye view of the 18th green and an unlimited supply of refreshments.  All in all, a good time for everyone.  ...until we got to E and Peach was so happy to see The Vest back from his vacation that she kissed him and threw the poor boy into shock, causing him to break a glass and slice off his hand (well, a portion of).  We never saw the actual wound - and he turned down our offer to take him to the ER, but I hope he's stitched up and heavily medicated and recovering...    But I think I need to keep an eye on Peach at the wine tasting tonight.  I'd hate to send another man in for medical care...  ;)  Update: It wasn't his entire hand, just the top of his finger.  12 stitches and possible plastic surgery.  At least it's his middle finger and he's having a lot of fun waving it around...

      I've changed to Blogger's new comment feature, and have apparently lost the ability to comment on old posts.  Don't have to time to look into it now, but will see what I can do about migrating the old ones over.    For now I have to deal with a much larger content migration plan...  I think the last month of this project is going to prove to be as time consuming (and frustrating) as the first.  I'm just glad it's going to be so worth the effort.  If all goes right, I'll be cutting my work in half.  Which means I'll only be doing the work of one person.    Until I find something else to take on...   Update: While I've figured out I can add the new comment functionality to existing posts (and will do so when I have the time), I don't think there's a way to migrate the old ones.  Yet.

      OK - some of you know this, but the whole reason I ended up with a blog is because I was encouraged to check out  urlLink RSS   urlLink  aggregation .  Which I did.    In my research, I found  urlLink this  aggregator, which rocks.  Then I started finding all these blogs out there with RSS feeds and figured I could do that.  The ironic part is that my blog's feed isn't RSS; it's Atom...  Which means I can't access it in my favorite aggregator.  Anyway, that was my version of a "catch you up to where I am now" introduction...  Here's an interesting  urlLink article  by Nick Bradbury on client side aggrators and their impact on bandwidth and how his aggregator was designed to minimize bandwidth consumption.

      You can't make this stuff up!  Following is an actual apology note that was mailed to the bartenders at E after a particularily rowdy performance a couple of weeks ago by a girl who at one time was a regular.    Please note:  Her behavior was obviously uncalled for, but culminated in her throwing a beer bottle across the bar which hit the rail, bounced, then came to a smashing finish on the floor.   She was asked to leave immediately.   It wasn't me (I wasn't even there that night).   I've omitted her name, but she signed the note card.   "Wanted to write a note to apologize for my behavior at the bar on Friday. I do not know what came over me and I am not only sorry but embarrassed. I hope that we can forgive and forget and know that it was just a bad moment. Thanks." I think it's safe to say the guys may forgive her, but I doubt anyone is going to forget this any time soon...

      It's a little difficult to be motivated at work today, but since Friday was such a disaster, I don't have much of a choice.  I'm just glad things are back to "normal" around here.   If there is such a thing a normal...

      After a CRAZY Friday, I'm finally taking a work-free weekend!  And it's not really by choice.  Yesterday morning, our network was crippled by a virus...  From 11:15 on, I was not able to access the internet, and by early afternoon, the network was disabled, and they finally closed the office at 4:15.  I, of course, stayed until 5:00.  Not that I could get any work done, but I was encouraged to go through the 7 boxes under my desk that have been there since I moved upstairs last year.  The good news is, I'm down to 2!  Judging from the lack of e-mails on my blackberry, I'm guessing they're still trying to get things back up and running.  But today is Peach's birthday outing.  She's kind enough to let me use her computer as I'm sipping my mimosa and we're preparing for our day.  I showed up at her door earlier with champagne in tow, to find we must have received the same memo on dress attire - not identical dresses (mine's embroidered silk and hers is linen), but identical style and colors.  At least we can tell each other apart - she's the blonde in the hat!   We're heading out to lunch then going to see  urlLink From El Greco to Picasso  this afternoon.  I'm looking forward to it - especially since this is the tour I *just* missed when I was in Denver this past January.  Plus it's my belated birthday present to Peach - so we have a rare girls' day out, which will be fun (I guess that's as opposed to the frequent girls' NIGHTs out - if you consider "out" playing trivia at E - which can be fun as well).  And Sunday.  For the first time since I don't know when I get to have my favorite Sunday morning coffee, paper, mimosa, crossword ritual.  Then I think I'll stop by E and catch a game or two.  :)

      Gotta admit, I love my  urlLink tablet pc .  EXCEPT for one thing...  Although I usually use it as a tablet, detached from the keyboard, I've been having to utilize the keyboard more often in the past couple of days, as I'm sort of under the weather right now.  And the function key is in the control key's place.  And I'm a big control key person.    Please, no comments about me being a control person...  I'm sick, remember?  Anyway, to better illustrate my problem, instead of typing in "amazon" and hitting control and enter, I'm hitting function and enter.  And it  just doesn't work.  So if anyone can reprogram this keyboard to switch those two buttons, I'd appreciate it.  OK, gonna see what TiVo has recorded for me.  Either that or break out the  urlLink Coupling  DVDs.

Instead, it's nearing midnight and I'm hyped up on prednisone and a variety of other prescription meds and am looking forward to surgery in the morning.  Guess next time I complain about needing time off work, I need to be more specific about the context...  Good thing I got TiVo set up.    ...OK, Joe got TiVo set up.

      So, I finally got my new  urlLink Tablet PC . And I've had a lot of fun playing with it over the past 24 hours. But, even more important is the fact that I have already found so many ways that it can help me at work. Windows Journal has already proven to be an incredibly useful tool. I am a list maker. I know that's not hard for any of you who actually know me to believe.   But I can write my lists in journal and edit and update and reorder, and it keeps up with me. And the handwriting recognition is amazing. Even when I scribble - which I have been known to do - And I happen to be doing now. This post is being written in Word with the Tablet PC Input Panel in Writing Pad mode.   So, the next time I meet with a department to discuss new development on the website or building out any of our other software products, I won't be using a whiteboard or using an easel and giant post-it notes. I'll hook this baby up to a projector and save our notes and immediately send an email with the outline of what we need to build.   And as I was thinking about how much this new toy is going to help me, I realized I still have 2 other toys still in their respective boxes that I can now play with, since my project from hell is over...  Coming soon... my reviews of TiVo and XM radio.  :)

      After the Summit was over, our overnight trip to Philly proved to be a wonderful idea.  Even though I was exhausted from a long week, we were able to have a lot of fun in a little time.  The  urlLink hotel  is one of the most spectacular buildings in the city - definitely worth a visit, if you're ever in town.  Tell Frank, the bartender, I said hello.  :)   urlLink Sushi  was wonderful...  we even got to see the  urlLink Iron Chef  himself.  Joe and I were the only people at the sushi bar, and he walked out of the kitchen and was standing 6 feet from us.  I smiled and nodded (my bad attempt at a bow), and he did the same.  We didn't get to see him in action, but he stood there watching the 5 sushi chefs VERY closely for several minutes.  &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Then we went to the  urlLink game  and saw the Phanatic and the new park and had a  urlLink cheese steak  and the Phillies won.  So we went back and saw Frank.  :)

      I've been in DC this week, for  urlLink work .  But the work is (almost) over and it's time to have fun.  Going to see a few sights tomorrow - I want to go see the  urlLink WWII Memorial , and whatever else time will allow.  Then, we're headed to Philly.  I have a date with an  urlLink Iron Chef .  Ok, technically, I have a date with Joe to go to the sushi bar at  urlLink Morimoto's  in Philadelphia, then we're headed to the  urlLink ballgame , then heading home Sunday.  And some time in there, we're having  urlLink cheesesteaks .  Yum.

      Having a good, albeit busy, week.  Lunch with  urlLink W  yesterday was good...  Although he wasn't fortunate enough to get to meet me.  ;)  Seriously, he and I and the other 800 people there really enjoyed ourselves.  I took a picture - I'll post when I'm back.  He's about a speck in the distance, but you can tell it's him.  Here's the full  urlLink speech  he gave.  So I want this day to be over.  Karen Hughes is speaking at this morning's general session, as her plane was delayed and she missed dinner last night.  But I'm hanging at the Internet Caf&#233, which turned out pretty cool.  I guess I can take pics of that as well...  But right now I'm just too tired to worry about it...

      Made it to DC just fine, despite the fact that my sweet fianc&#233 decided to call the hotel and add his platinum # to my room, intending for me to get an upgrade and additional goodies, but resulting in my reservation being cancelled and changed to his name...  But after a few minutes (and my heart stopping when I heard I had no reservation and the hotel is 50 rooms overbooked), we got it straightened out.  And it looks like  he's  picking up the sushi tab.  :)

      It's hard to believe our site rebrand/new CMS/new everything project is over.  Well, "phase one" is over.  I didn't know what to do with myself this weekend.  ...ok, so maybe I did...  I left work at 2:00 Friday afternoon, went to E and got drunk in the middle of the afternoon with some of the team members.  I was lucky enough to have a safe ride home, and got my car Saturday afternoon, once I woke up.  Not sure how much of the sleep was caused by the past week's work schedule and how much was caused by the celebration, but it was  wonderful  (although anyone who knows me is well aware that staying in bed past 8:00 on a weekend is unheard of for me, not to mention the intense guilt I feel having lost half a day...).  This week is going to be mostly touch-ups and tweaks (and rest) for most of the team - I'm headed to that  urlLink shindig  in D.C.  We'll call it DblU meets Dubya.  :)

      Gonna post links and such once I'm home, because it's too difficult to do on the road.  Didn't make it to Fremont last night.  Once we got to the  urlLink Marriott  (think spa in the desert on the TPC golf course...), I decided it was best to hang out here.  Won $2oo in half an hour and decided to quit while I was ahead (and even for the trip if you count the cost of changing my ticket, which I do, but Joe doesn't).  Hung out at the Irish pub here and called it a day early.  Might go visit that machine before we head out to dinner.  Might come back here next summer to get married.  Dave (the bartender) says he'll see us then.  Heading downtown as soon as we're all cleaned up and eat something to soak up the alcohol that we consumed at the pool.  At least I finally have a tan.  :)

       urlLink Polite computers win users' hearts and minds   an excerpt:   The trick, according to a researcher who has analysed users' responses to their computers, is to make operating systems and software more "civilised" by saying sorry more often. That way people won't feel they are stupid or at fault, so they become less apprehensive about using computers, and perhaps more productive and creative. (from  urlLink Tomalak )

      Spent the weekend in Denver, thanks to  urlLink Frontier Airlines .  Had a lot of fun in a little time.  This being my first Frontier experience, I was looking forward to seeing how it compares to  urlLink Southwest  (no contest) and also thrilled to have an affordable non-stop option to Denver.  First off, Frontier has seat assignments (big win).  Second, they allow you to pay $5 and watch any of 24 channels of live TV (including Food Network) via  urlLink DirectTV .  And they serve  urlLink decent   urlLink beer .  I'm not impressed with the  urlLink animals on the planes , but I found out that one of their major ad campaigns centers around the animals talking to each other while sitting at the gate.  Still don't think much of it (in fact probably less) - Southwest's cleverly decorated regional planes win out, hands down.  As does their magazine.  In fact, I quickly flipped through Frontier's rag and wrote it off (read: no crossword).  And when I read in the  urlLink Sunday paper  that it was a new product of their ad agency and was "worth" $8 a month as a high-end coffee table magazine, I was more than a little skeptical.  So, fly Frontier if you can.  Row 9 is exit row, for those who want some leg room.  And have a Foster's or a Newcastle and pay the $5 for TV, even if only to ensure that the person next to you won't speak to you during the flight.

      Ok - I've been playing at  urlLink Google Labs  again.  I've created my own "site-flavored" search box.  The results are selected from pages that reflect the profile I created by selecting the topics that reflect the content of my site.  I figured since this is all about me (well, not  all  about me, but not about anything not relevant to me...), I needed to select the topics based on my personal preferences, not limited to the content that has already made the journey from my mind to the keyboard.  Here's my list of topics: (and my 'logic" for each selection)  Business/Industries &#8594; Information Technology (that's where I work)   Health &#8594; Mental Health (because I question mine at times)   Home &#8594; Cooking AND Home Entertaining (I like to cook, and if I ever get around to cooking, I might invite people over)   Recreation &#8594; Games &#8594; Puzzles (since I do the Sunday crossword puzzle)   Recreation &#8594; Motorcycles (I have a really cool leather biker jacket that I need an excuse to wear)   Regions &#8594; N. America - USA &#8594; Delaware AND Indiana AND Tennessee (3 of the 5 states in which I've lived - the other 2 didn't make the cut - don't know that I can explain it)   Regions &#8594; Caribbean (I really enjoyed my vacation last fall)   Sports &#8594; Basketball (Go  urlLink Hoosiers )   And the search...    Well, I tried to put it in this post, and can't because Blogger doesn't allow JavaScript.  And I didn't realize that until too late into this.  I can post it in the footer, if anyone REALLY wants to see the world through Linda-tinted glasses.  I will say that a search for "beach" brought up 3 Beach Basketball sites, the Beach Center (for emotional, behavioral, and intellectual disabilities), Indiana Beach, and Rehobeth Beach Delaware within the top 10 results.  Although, I was thinking more along the lines of Belize.

      The power here at work just went out for a few minutes - if that.  I found myself wishing it wouldn't come back, but in the almost 4 years I've been here, there have been multiple times I've spent hours waiting to see if the power would come back or if they would just go ahead and close the office.  And after 30 minutes, no power (read "no AC") can be horrible in Nashville.  I have to say, I'm glad to be back at work and comfortable, rather than sitting in the dark, surrounded by sweaty people.  :)

      Within a time frame of 4 hours this evening, I found out that my parents' divorce was "final" and the father of a good friend had died.  I met most of  urlLink Brian's  family on a Caribbean cruise last fall, and quickly adopted his dad (with his mother's blessing) as my "boyfriend".  We found out shortly after the cruise was over that his dad was sick, and now he's gone and I just hope he's better off and not suffering and waiting for us all in a better place.  My parents are another story.  I found out days before the cruise that the divorce was imminent, and was sworn to secrecy to keep it from my siblings at the same time.  So to leave my nightmare and go on a vacation with my friends and newly-found extended family was difficult, to say the least.  But I struggle tonight to accept that, although it's hard to accept he's gone, Brian's family can move on and make the best of things and have an endless stream of happy memories.  My family has just begun the struggle, and memories that may have once seemed "happy" are tainted.  My mother, who has been incredibly strong since this started, has finally lost it and cannot speak to me or my siblings without breaking down.    And I wonder how selfish it is for me (hence the comments for this post being disabled) to think about how better off we'd be if the man I used to call Dad had just died instead of divorcing us...

      Day 2 back at work and already ready to go home.  I should have listened to my doctor and waited until Monday to come back, but we all know I'm too stubborn for that.  Besides, just being able to sort through e-mail has helped, and if I cancelled the meetings I've already made people reschedule twice one  more  time, they might decide to have them without me.  And that would mean someone making a decision without my input, and we all know that wouldn't fly (at least with me).  ;)  Busy weekend already - Daisy's 30th birthday has finally arrived, and we're going out celebrating Saturday.  Don't know how long I'll be able to stay out, but I can't miss this one.  Brunch Sunday, followed by an evening at  urlLink The Bluebird Cafe , for Jeanne's debut. No - not my sister, the OTHER Jeanne in my life... ;)  Sometime in there, I have a couple of bottles of asti that will make some pretty darn good mimosas.  I think I just planned Saturday afternoon.  :)

      Found myself having an intellectual conversation in the lounge last night.  About the origin of "33" on Rolling Rock bottles.  Of course, most of you who have had this conversation with me know MY take...  I go for the traditional "number of words in the slogan" theory.  As opposed to the "year prohibition ended" theory.  And since this year I AM Rolling Rock (33).  I figure it's going to be a good year.  Some time soon.  :)

      I've just discovered this  urlLink hotel's  strategy.  Pay for high-speed access in the room, or have free wireless in the lounge overlooking the bay...  40 pages away from finishing my  urlLink book .  And even though I found a typo on page 223, I'm still enjoying it.  Learned something, too.  I've never been able to figure out where the polar bears are...  But "Arktos" is Greek for bear.  So polar bears are in the Arctic.  And "Anti-arktos" (Antarctica) has no bears.  Go figure.    I know, easily amused...

      The good news is my rescheduled  urlLink seminar  is in San Francisco.  Unfortunately, it's out by the airport, so it's not convenient to anything too exciting, but the  urlLink view  ain't bad.  I was impressed that at any time during my cab ride last night on the way to the hotel, I was picking up no less than 6 wireless networks at any given time.  I doubt I'll see that any time soon in Nashville.  :)

      I have to leave for the airport in one hour.  Before I go, I need to shower and get dressed and pack...  Something tells me I should be taking care of that and not sitting here.  I am positive my neighbors think I'm nuts.  This morning, Peach called and invited me over for coffee, and when I told her I was still in my PJs and she said it was no big deal, I put on a pair of sandals and left.  Getting home at noon still in my PJs probably didn't raise my credibility with the neighbors.  Not to mention I was carrying half of Peach's wardrobe (when I mentioned I had no idea what I was going to pack, we raided her closet and solved that problem).  The couples' shower for my brother and his better half went well.  My contributions to the buffet went over more than really well.  I've often thought maybe I should take food that no one likes to these things, so I'm not asked to bring stuff in the future, but we all know I'd never stand for that...  Got to catch up with Cutter, my bro's best friend since adolescence.  I was telling Peach earlier that it's hard to believe that I can have an adult conversation with the guy that used to torment me, but I did.  When the shower was winding down, Cutter asked where we could go and have a beer and hang out, so I took him to E.  Of course, all of the regulars (at least the ones I would want to see) were either still at the shower or home, but we had a nice chat.  I guess I didn't figure that even though he was my brother's annoying friend all those years, he has known me over half my life and knows me better than most.  So the two of us solved all the world's problems over a few pints and called it a night.  Heading to San Francisco for my conference I missed a month and a half ago - and looking forward to some time away.  Although, I guess I better get upstairs and get in the shower and pack, unless I want to spend the entire week in my PJs.

      I know there are tons of places that offer Gmail tips, but other than when I first started using it, I rarely go.  So I was pretty proud of myself when I figured out how to work around the biggest "flaw" (imho) with Gmail: not being able to save a draft.  The main reason I want to save a draft is because I start to reply to a message and end up being interrupted, or know I need to reply, but I'm not ready to reply... and sometimes it might take me several hours before I have completed my response.   I'm rambling.  Anyway...  If I have the reply open for 3 hours, I can't see when I have received new mail.    My solution:  press shift as you click "reply" and open it in a new window.  Pretty clever, huh?  I think I'm far too easily entertained.  ;)

      I've been feeling more than a little overwhelmed lately and find I am having difficulty "catching up" and haven't felt rested since I don't know when.  And I started thinking about what I've been through lately - since July:  Had surgery and was off work 12 days (should have been more)   Introduced my mother and Joe's mom (one of my first post-op outings)   My parents divorced, my father moved out, their house went on the market (and a contract is pending)   Spent 3 days in Denver   Spent 4 days in Las Vegas   My "better half" at work moved on to greener pastures   Good thing there's not much going on now - all I have to do is throw this couple's shower for my bro and his fiancée this weekend, go to San Francisco for a conference Sunday through Thursday, head to Chicago Friday, Cubs game Saturday, home Sunday and back to work.  Seriously, after THAT, I hope things calm down. Other than my mother buying and moving into a new house and my brother's wedding (along with all of the out of town guests and family attending the first family function post-divorce...), what  else  could happen in September?  Don't answer that.  Seriously.

      "This posting is a community experiment started by  urlLink Minding the Planet  to see how a meme represented by a blog posting spreads across blogspace, physical space and time. It will help to show how ideas travel across blogs in space and time and how blogs are connected. It may also help to show which blogs are most influential in the propagation of memes. The original posting for this experiment is located at: Minding the Planet; results and commentary will appear there in the future.  Please join the test by adding your blog (see instructions, below) and inviting your friends to participate — the more the better. The data from this test will be public and open; others may use it to visualize and study the connectedness of blogspace and the propagation of memes across blogs.  The GUID for this experiment is: as098398298250swg9e98929872525389t9987898tq98wteqtgaq6-2010920352598gawst (this GUID enables anyone to easily search Google for all results of this experiment). The new GUID is as098398298250swg9e.  Anyone is free to analyze the data of this experiment. Please publicize your analysis of the data, and/or any comments by adding comments onto the original post at Minding the Planet; Note: it would be interesting to see a geographic map or a temporal animation, as well as a social network map of the propagation of this meme.  INSTRUCTIONS  To add your blog to this experiment, copy this entire posting to your blog, and fill out the info below, substituting your own information in your posting, where appropriate.  (Note: Replace the answers below with your own answers)  1. I found this experiment at URL:  urlLink http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2004_08_02_index.html#109146371104335033  2. I found it via “Newsreader Software” or “Browsing or Searching the Web” or “An E-Mail Message”: Newsreader Software (FeedDemon) 3. I posted this experiment at URL: http://lindadblu.blogspot.com 4. I posted this on date (day, month, year): 02 August 2004 5. I posted this at time (24 hour time): 14:36 6. My posting location is (city, state, country): Nashville, Tennessee, US  OPTIONAL SURVEY FIELDS (Replace the answers below with your own answers): 1. My blog is hosted by: Blogger 2. My age is: 33 3. My gender is: F 4. My occupation is: Software Product Manager 5. I use the following RSS/Atom reader software: FeedDemon 6. I use the following software to post to my blog: Blogger 7. I have been blogging since (day, month, year): 10 March 2004 8. My web browser is: Avant 9. My operating system is: Windows XP  PS: The Google-ID was so long several people already broke it up into separate parts (like as098398298250swg9e98929872525389t9987898tq98wteqtgaq6 - 2010920352598gawstw98qwrt189849813907azq4). This of course will make it impossible to use it in a Google search to retrieve all relevant postings spreading this meme. I wonder why the original author didn't think of a short ID to prevent this. In any case, a search query such as "The dataset generated by this experiment could help us" will work as well.

      Didn't intend to post 2 (non-related) items in a row with the same title, but these things happen. If it bugs you, you'll get over it. More importantly,  I  will.  Been meaning to post this for a while (days/weeks - not really sure... it's all been a blur lately, anyway). Just thought it was a really cool picture and was reminded of it when I saw something about the blue moon on the news.    urlLink     This photo is from the  urlLink Apollo Image Gallery . If you go to "11-pg2", you can see all of the photos in the Earthrise sequence.
