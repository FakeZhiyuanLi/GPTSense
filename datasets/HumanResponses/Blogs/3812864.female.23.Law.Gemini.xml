      Ok. It has to be said. In the United States of America we drive on the right-hand side of the road.&nbsp; Pedestrians, contrary to popular belief amoung you, this rule applies to you as well!!!!!! I walk from the T (subway station) to and from work every day and have witnessed this disregard for the rules of the road/sidewalk numerous times. It has become a major pet peeve&nbsp;of mine.&nbsp; Then there are the people who walk in packs of family or friends and take up the entire width of the sidewalk so that noone going either way has any chance of passing. I implore&nbsp;all pedestrians to atleast attempt to be considerate of other pedestrians.   That is my rant of the morning.&nbsp;

      Tremendous Tuesday is here!&nbsp; The commute is already affecting me! I was fast asleep by 9:00 - 9:30 last night! Poor Brad...  &nbsp;  So, I realized that my little brother will be 17 years old&nbsp;in 2 days time.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am shocked. Where did the time go?&nbsp; I remember him at&nbsp;2 years old with his long floppy blond hair and footsie pajamas.&nbsp; Apparantly, those days are long gone.&nbsp; He told me that, if I am not buying him an automobile,&nbsp; he does not want a birthday gift.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;I am going to make him a homemade birthday card (probably in the shape of a car or with cutouts of pictures of cars or with cutouts of car advertisments) and make that his gift.&nbsp; It will aid him in his car search.&nbsp; Even if&nbsp;I could afford it, he would not recieve a car from me.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is something about purchasing your first car. It's special. There is something about earning it.&nbsp; Anyway, in addition to realizing that he is turning 17, I have also realized that he will be a senior in high school come September.&nbsp; That means he will be off to college within a years time. I am just in a state of disbelief.  &nbsp;  I do believe work officially begins in 12 minutes or so which means I must say tata for now.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Good Morning!  &nbsp;  Well, I have a job.&nbsp;I am working at a&nbsp;medium size&nbsp;law firm in Boston as&nbsp;a legal secretary. Today marks the first day of my second week. The position is temporary as a trial&nbsp;for the first month and then, hopefully, it will become permenant.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Next weekend is Nascar in New Hampshire with Brad's family.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have never been to a Nascar race so this will be an adventure.&nbsp; I can't imagine how loud and crowded it is going to be.&nbsp; I have been to the New Hampshire Speedway many times before, but I have only ever sat in the infield and it has been small performance driving school events.&nbsp; Brad has a Mitzubishi Lancer Evolution VIII that he drives in the events (and daily).  &nbsp;  Vegas is coming! Vegas is coming! Brad leaves a week from Wednesday for work and I join him August 6th for pleasure.&nbsp; I have already started packing!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope he sticks to watching movies and playing videogames and reading while he is there for work so that he isn't tired of Vegas by the time I get there.  &nbsp;  We had a great weekend this weekend.&nbsp; Friday we hung out with our friends Tanya and Greg and watched "Welcome to Mooseport" OnDemand.&nbsp; Saturday we hung out, went for a walk, and went to Hot Import Nights at the Bayside Expo Center. Sunday we went to Wrentham Outlets to do some Vegas Shopping, to his parents to celebrate his 24th birthday13 days early because he will be in Vegas on his actual birthday, and to see my family before heading home.&nbsp; I forgot how fast weekends pass when you are working.  &nbsp;  Well, I am officially at work in 10 minutes. Yippee :-)  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Rob the Recruiter is an inconsiderate asshole of the lowest order. Until he proves otherwise, he will from here on in be referred to as Rob the Rectum. Explanation: I went in to the city today to meet with Rob the Recruiter. I paid my $2.50 round-trip to ride the redline subway. I paid my $4.50 for the privilage of parking at the Alewife T station. I must go into the city to meet Rob for 2:00 P.M. I get there a little bit early so that I am positive about where I am going and I allow enough time in case of anything happening with the inconsistancies of the Boston public transit system. At 12:30 P.M. Rob the Recruiter calls me to tell me that he didn't know when he made my appointment, but the office is closing early and we will have to reschedule. At that moment he became Rob the Rectum. I am UNEMPLOYED. I have LIMITED RESOURCES. I PAID $7.00 in transportation and parking and he cancels our appointment an hour and a half before it is supposed to begin. I am not pleased. His ass is lucky&nbsp;I am giving him a chance to redeem himself by agreeing to meet with him on Tuesday at 2:00 P.M. People are so rude and inconsiderate and thoughtless. I am terribly displeased and disenchanted with Rob the Rectum and the recruiting firm he works for.   I enjoyed walking through the Common and the Gardens and along Newbury Street. I stopped at a couple of&nbsp;second hand stores and ended up buying one top for Vegas. I won't discribe it because Brad reads my blog and wants to be surprised, but IT'S  SASSY  and it was cheap. I am getting more and more stoked for this trip!   Off to change out of this stuffy suit and cool down.

      Good Morning! Just a quick entry before I head off to Boston to shop and meet Rob the Recruiter.   This morning I have folded a load of laundry, made boyfriend's lunch, and washed the dishes.   I went shopping yesterday. It was a disaster. Sizes change from store to store. The tops I tried on would fit in my waist and my chest, but not it my ribcage  OR  fit in my ribcage and be too big in my waist and my chest. Highly frustrating. Had the same problem with dresses. If at first you fail, try try again.   I am vegan which means I do not eat meat or fish or eggs or dairy products. Last night I made my boyfriend steak tips for dinner. Occasionally I cook meat for him, but it is becoming more and more frequent because he is working ridiculously long hours and I find myself with time on my hands as I am currently unemployed. Cooking meat is an interesting process. I never quite know when it is done or how to flavor it. He likes it pink, but I never know how pink and it goes so quickly from being pink to being brown and tough. I guess I did ok last night with his guidance, but... let us just say, YIPPEE FOR VEGAN :-) As far as cooking the meat goes, I guess I will keep trying as long as he is a carnivore.   There were amazing thunderstorms early this morning. Brad, my boyfriend (amoung many other titles he holds), woke me up to listen. I love thunderstorms. An old poem of mine:    September 24, 2002    A couple of nights ago it rained  REALLY RAINED  HARD  Beating the ground  Tne window panes  The roof  The flowers  The rivers  The ponds  Really Rained  HARD   And I laid in bed and listened  I feel so peaceful  Relaxed  Thoughtful  When it rains like that   It's almost a relief  It was one of those rains that starts hard and ends hard  And doesn't leave a trace  Had you not been awake when it happened  you never would have known it rained by morning   It's a relief  To the natural world  AND to the few souls who experience it  Started at 1:30 a.m. and was over by 2:45 a.m.  I'm glad I didn't miss it   It's relieving in a "good long cry alone" way  It's relieving in a "dancing alone in public like nobody is watching" way  It's relieving in a "screaming at the tope of your lungs for no reason and so many reasons all at once" way  Maybe more of a release than a relief...   I don't know  But every time I experience a rain like that, especially at night, I stop everything and lay down or stretch out in the window seat  Close my eyes  AND listen  As everything washes away  Relief, release, relax, rejuvenate...  Begin again  A fresh start

      Just came back from meeting with a woman named Erin at a staffing firm.  Very helpful. Interesting insite. Many potential jobs. I am going to make some changes to the resume and she'll be sending it off to a potential employer today. I feel confident that she understands me and will help me to expand my opportunities jobwise. Tomorrow I go to Boston to meet with Rob at a different staffing firm. And the opportunities keep expanding...  So, I am going to Vegas with my boyfriend in a month or so.  It will celebrate our summer birthdays and our "official" three year anniversary. Men are so funny about anniversaries. Technically, according to me, our 3 year anniversary was May 5, 2004 which is the day we met. We have not been without contact for more than a week since then and he only had one or two dates with someone else briefly. So, we have been doing bf/gf stuff since May 5, 2001, BUT he didn't come around and we didn't SAY that we were bf/gf until August 10, 2001. So, we go by the August anniversary. Men are so different when it comes to commitment.  ANYWAY , we are going to Vegas in August and I need some sexy tops/clothes to wear. I have been very very very tight with my money being unemployed and all, but I think I may go shopping later this afternoon. I have heard you can be anyone you want to be in Vegas and I think I may take advantage of this opportunity to be anyone I want on any given day. Gotta have the wardrobe to dress the part(s) though. I may hit some second hand stores in the city tomorrow, too.   I came home from my meeting with Erin today to find a loud buzzing scary noise coming from the apartment in which I reside. Not a fire alarm. Loudest in the livingroom. Don't see any large insects or aliens or fire or smoke. The computer, TV, oven, and stove are off. All the lights are off. Hmmm...  So, I leave the apartment and call my boyfriend at work. I apologize profusely for interupting him at work for something so petty, but... So, he listened to the noise and found it just as peculiar. Since the sound was loudest in the livingroom, I asked him if the reciever on the TV or the subwoofer or something could have freaked out. So, I turned off the reciever (after he helped me figure out which one of the 6 remote controls I should be using and which buttons I needed to push on said remote control) and silence ensued. Damn. We may have to replace the sound system. Damn. As an aside, might someone explain to me why we must have so many remote controls and why each needs atleast 100 buttons?  Well, for now, I must get to work on sprucing up the resume and creating a wardrobe for my Vegas persona(s).

      Up at 6:30. Made boyfriend's lunch. Did the dishes. Starting my Blog.  I have a one o'clock appointment with a staffing firm today. Yippee to finding a job. Legal assistant? Entry-Level position at a publishing house? What I really want to do is simply write. Right now that doesn't pay the bills or get me health insurance. So sad to feel/know? that money makes the world go round.  My oldest sister had her fifth baby yesterday. Marielle Carly. It's exciting to be an aunt. Pretty soon I will hop or a train or plane or automobile and head off to Pennsylvania to see her.  Babies and family are wonderful things.   Off to job search, shower, and dress-up all professional.

      Good Morning!  This week is my last week as a temp.  I will find out by Friday whether or not I will be made a permenant member of the staff.  I am hoping that the answer is yes.  Friday I am off to Las Vegas to join Brad! He will have been there a week come tomorrow.  Needless to say, I am very very excited for Friday for very many reasons.  I have a list of things I need to do before Thursday night.  I am not sure that they are all going to get done, but i am trying.  It can be stressful trying to get everything set before going on vacation.  I had to get someone to water Hector (our algerian ivy plant); I am trying to clean the apartment (vacuum, wash the kitchen and bathroom floors, clean the bathroom, dust, have all the dishes done and put away, make the bed, etc.) so that we don't come home to a disaster; I am trying to pack which is becoming challenging.  I have little odds and ends I need to take care of like paying the bills so that they aren't forgotten.  So, I will just do what I can and the rest will wait.  It will definately all still be here upon our return.  I just finished reading an interesting book called Unravelled about a non-conformist woman in 1600's New England.  Very heavy, kind of dark, soul searching type of book. Now I have picked up a Robert Parker book titled Shrink Rap.  Parker is always such a fast read and his books always keep moving.  A welcome contrast from Unravelling.  Very hard to put down.  Plus, he and his wife live in Cambridge and my father taught with him at Northeastern University (they haven't really kept in touch) so I am a big supporter of him.  The DNC has left Boston and now things are busy and busseling as ever.  I miss the leisurely evening commute.  During the convention it took me maybe, 3 to 5 minutes to exit Alewife T Station's parking garage and get on route 2.  Last night it took 20 minutes or so. Route 2 is usually more or less the same, but I would say that route 2 took maybe 5 or 10 minutes more last night than during the convention.  I also had to wait for two red line trains to go by before I could hop on one last night, because they were so full.   Things have quickly returned to normal.  Well, I have to get to work. The bell will soon strike 9 A.M.
