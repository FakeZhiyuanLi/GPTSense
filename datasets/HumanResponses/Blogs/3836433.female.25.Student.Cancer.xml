      My brother, Ethan, is currently far from home&nbsp;at a motel/inn in Tennessee with&nbsp;a bad case of food poisoning, travel sickness,&nbsp;and diarrhea.&nbsp; So I am dedicating today's blog to preventing this scenario from happening to you, my beloved audience. Tip of the Day:&nbsp; Don't eat the sausage if it's gray.&nbsp;

      We haven't found a good source of food on this island yet.  We have eaten the remainder of our rations, mostly rice, with grubs from the nearby vegetation.  Most of the coconuts are too far to reach, so we've been drinking dew from the leaves.  Tonight we are planning to ambush the camera man, use his lighter to start a fire, then barbeque him.  Hopefully this works.  We are starting to look like fat camp rejects.  P.S.  Happy Birthday, Ethan.

      I am really excited!  Tomorrow I am meeting with a professor for all the details (and teaching materials) I will need to teach my first remedial English class in the fall.  I kind of feel like a kid playing house...I wonder if that feeling goes away with experience or if that's just how toying with other people's lives, via getting into their heads and teaching them something, feels like.  I'll let you know...

      Just so everyone knows...my new favorite phrase is catching on!  I have been sharing the story of "Great lakes, Great times" with some friends (i.e. Jeannie) and she, in turn, told everyone at her office about it.  They laughed, which is considerable since she works at CPS...  Keep spreadin' the gospel...

      Yes world, I am 25.  I found my first gray hair a couple of days ago, which sparked my pre-midlife crisis...But that's over now.  Thanks to my friends and fam for helping me through!

      Think about it... It makes sense, doesn't it?  My friend just lost her Shih Tzu of 11 years and I comforted her with this catchy, upbeat slogan.  Try it out on a friend in need...I think you'll find that you've proven to be a friend.  Indeed.

      Today the voices inside my head told me to grab a screwdriver. So I've got that accomplished. Don't know what I should do with it yet...

      Okay.  So I didn't intend to create my own blog.  I only meant to respond to a friend's blog, but here I am.  I suppose I should write something witty or profound.  Or I could just pretend I am the only person reading this (which may be closer to the truth) and write with reckless abandon.  No, I may be too paranoid for that...

      Okay, I'll admit it.  Usually, I have alot to say.  However, I have been having a hard time thinking of things to blog.  I can't really blog my poetry because that would be like publishing it, and then I wouldn't be able to submit to journals for the express intent of publishing.  And I have a pen & paper journal I already write my thoughts in on a day to day basis.  One interesting thing is that I wrote a poem last year with the image of a hurricane in Florida, and now a hurricane is really in Florida.  That makes me feel kind of clairvoyant.

      The legend continues!  Richard Marx's new CD, "My Own Best Enemy," will be out in stores this Tuesday, August 10th!  I just couldn't keep this exciting news to myself!  So I thought I would share it with you, the rest of the world.  I hope his tour comes to Texas...I have been waiting forever to see him in concert!
