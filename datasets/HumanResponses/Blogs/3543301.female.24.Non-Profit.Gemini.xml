      T-Mac to Houston.    I don't know how I feel about this just yet.  I love him, but Houston???  I need to get over the I-10 rivalry before October.    I hope Shaq goes to the Mavs.  That way I can keep hating them.  If the Kings pull some more crap like the Jimmy Jackson trade last summer, I'mma be pissed.  damn.  T-Mac to Houston.

      San Diego was incredible.  I had so much fun, and after the horrible 18 months I've had, it was so nice to be at an event where there was nothing but joy and celebration.  Joyce was absolutely stunning, Joe was so happy, and the rest of us were just caught up in their love and it was perfect.  The weather, the setting, the ceremony, the people, everything was perfect.    I got to go to In-N-Out (oh, the little things it takes to make me happy), went to La Jolla and Balboa Park, and got to spend a lot of time with friends acting stupid.  I needed this weekend, and it couldn't have come at a better time.  I'm really energized now, which is important because we got a ton of stuff this week.    We move into a new apartment and have friends coming for the long weekend.  I will be exhausted, but I love it.  Plus, we have Monday off.    Tonight is the  urlLink Rufus  concert.  I'm sad I'll miss  urlLink The Streets  on Thursday, but Anjals will be in town and she's more entertaining on her worst day than The Streets are on their best day.

      i usually think people are cheesy when they quote lyrics from songs even though i can relate to many of them.  you know what i mean.  i'm talking about those mariah carey fans who cry when they see her and say that her lyrics mean so much to them, blah blah blah.  anyway, track #1 on joss stone's album has some great lyrics for where i am right now emotionally.  yeah, yeah...i'm one of them cheesy-ass people.  oh well.  wait until i'm over this depressing slump...it's back to the dirrrrrty south classics.

      joss stone's voice is incredible.  the only problem i have is that everyone's making this huge deal about her when black women have been singing this music forever.  then, a white girl comes along and gets tons of attention.  i mean, seriously.  angie stone is backing her with vocals (and we all know how incredible she is), but has anyone seen an angie video on mtv?  bet, yes, but not mainstream mtv.  it's like eminem.  he gets away with saying so much shit.  if a brotha said half the things eminem says, he'd be crucified.  still, i'm not trying to discount her talent.  her voice is great, especially considering her age, but can we give some love to jill scott, angie stone, and all the other sistas too?  and can someone please shut eminem up?

      I love my sister so much.  I love that she gets worried about me when I freak out.  I love that she's become my friend, and not just my sister.  I love that she mothers me.  I love that when she gives me a hug, I feel so much better about everything.  I love that she loves me so much.  We went and saw "SuperSize Me" yesterday to cheer me up.  It did.  That movie's hysterical.  Watch it and read "Fast Food Nation" ASAP.    I love my friends.  I love that Miguel was gonna cancel his date yesterday if I wanted to talk.  I love that he checked up on me this morning.  I love that Thad called to tell me about how he had to rush home to clean his oven, calling it the 'gayest thing ever'.  I love that Anjali is coming here for the 4th of July and that we will have an excuse to act ridiculous.  Not that we need an excuse, but still.  I miss that girl so much.  Most of all, I love that I'm going to San Diego on Thursday and I'll be gone until Monday.  No email, no internet, and no contact.  I love that I will be hanging out with people who genuinely appreciate my company.  I love that the weather there is like 70 degrees and perfect while it'll be pouring here.  I hate liars.  I hate people who lie just because they don't want to hurt you.  Those people never think about how hurt you will be when you find out the truth, because inevitably, the truth will come out.  Damn, doesn't anyone watch soap operas anymore?

      I know I shouldn't be surprised because men are all the same, but I am.  He's on the phone with me saying the most incredible things and talking about how he loves me and let's run away together, blah blah blah.  Then, an hour later, he's with her.  Probably telling her the same thing.  I was so dead set on getting involved with anyone.  I have never trusted men.  This one made me trust him.  He completely won me over and I opened up my heart to him like never before, and it was all a sick game.    Why do guys do that time and time again?    I hope he wallows in his own misery.  I hope she realizes he's not worth it.    Sing it, Carl Thomas.

      So check this.  I'm at work yesterday and I get an email from my sister telling me that Alan (our apartment manager) called about a problem with my credit (we're moving apartments and since I moved in with her, he had to check my credit as a routine procedure to put me on the new lease).  So, I'm like "oh, no big deal.  it was probably something in college."  You know, like those credit cards you sign up for to get a t-shirt or something stupid like that.  Alan tells my sister that I'm gonna have trouble getting a loan, so she gets a bit worried and emails me.  I order a credit report and find out that some asshole in Houston has been opening up credit cards with my information and charging up a storm!!!  I got an address and phone number for these jackasses and it's taking all my self-control not to call them and scream at them.  Now, I have to go through SO MUCH CRAP to get this fixed and it could take years to completely get taken care of.  I'm so annoyed.  It's so easy for them to open up accounts and ruin my credit and it's such a pain in the ass for me to get it fixed.  I feel like Nancy Kerrigan when she got clubbed.  The credit card companies are also idiots.  These fools opened up an account in December 2003, and then it was put under investigation in January 2004 (no clue why), but they still ISSUED ANOTHER CARD TO THESE IDIOTS IN MARCH which was also put under investigation in May.  WHY WOULD YOU ISSUE THEM ANOTHER ONE IF YOU'RE INVESTIGATING THE FIRST ONE???    Sigh.  I'm gonna get no work done today.  I'm just waiting for the cops to call.  I hate the Houston Police Department.  Nothing gets done.  Another reason why I should never have moved there in the first place.  Happy Humpday.

      my horoscope today:   "Memories of childhood, both happy and painful, Rayma, could come to mind today, bringing new understandings of how your early life experiences affect your present situation. Unexpected insights may come your way, bringing a new perspective on both present and future. You could well realize that a course you have been pursuing, either personal or professional, is not really right for you, and that it is time to make a shift. Don't allow fear to overwhelm your need for transition."

      Ok, Reagan died.  It's sad when anyone dies, no doubt, but does this man need to be canonized?  He was far from the 'best president of the 20th century'.  Have we already forgotten everything that happened during his term?  A horrible recession, the complete and utter disregard for human life when HIV/AIDS was first discovered, Iran Contra, Star Wars?  Honestly, I can't talk about politics as eloquently as Ted Rall (mainly because I can't even have civilized conversations with Conservatives...I end up screaming and looking like a fool and my point ends up being lost), so I'll just point you to  urlLink his page  and let you read.    He's a genius.  I agree with almost everything he says.  Except, of course, his call to impeach Clinton.  His perjury charge should have been thrown out becuse it was entrapment, plain and simple.  They asked him about Monica solely to catch him in a lie.  There was no other reason to ask.  One can only hope that Goldberg, Tripp, Starr, and all the other evil Republicans get their due some day.  That being said, I would have been Monica any day of the week.    'Namean?

      Great, great, great show last night!  I love  urlLink his  CD, and heard that although he doesn't have great interaction with the crowd, he puts on a great show.  I got my sister and Miguel to go with me, and Gavin was brilliant.  He was on for about an hour and a half and did covers of 'Let's Get It On' and 'Hallelujah', plus a couple others, including an old Smokey Robinson song.  We were highly impressed.  We missed Michael Tolcher (the first opener), but heard Toby Lightman's set.  She was incredible, AND did a cover of 'Real Love' by Mary J.  WHO SHE?  When the song started, Miguel all "is that real love?" and I was clowning him, but then he turned out to be the ultimate musical genius.  Who he calling it?  I am impressed.

      So he tells me he might go on a date with this girl (who I hate...probably because she's 20 and skinny) right before my birthday.  He knew how I felt about her, he knew how hard it would be when he told me he was dating again, and he knew how much I was dreading my first birthday without my mother, but he did it anyway.  I know he wasn't intentionally trying to be mean.  I know he just wasn't thinking.  But still.  It's not cool.  I feel so 'over'.

      I love how hypocritical Republicans are.  Bush ran as the "Education President", yet he's cutting school funding so much that kids in Oregon had to miss 7 weeks of classes last year because they couldn't afford to keep the school open.  Plus, he had some fundraiser in NYC where they had to close the streets for security reasons, and kids missed a day of school because of that.  He's probably wishing he was a kid now just so he wouldn't have to go to school.  Oh, and remember the whole "W is for Women" thing?  He's cutting WIC!  WIC!!!  The Women, Infants, and Children program that takes care of necessities like milk, bread, cheese, eggs.  They say it's part of their whole "cutting down on domestic spending" thing.  Seriously, how much money is cutting WIC gonna save?  How is our country gonna benefit from starving our poor kids?  So the Rep. party likes to call Kerry a flip-flopper.  Maybe he is, maybe he isn't.  However, I'm sure Bible-thumping Dubya remembers this classic from the Bible: "Let he who has not sinned cast the first stone".     urlLink Pot, meet Kettle.

      Went to NYC with my sister and some friends for Memorial Day weekend.  One of the funnier things was walking around Chelsea at about 1:30am on Sunday/Monday morning.  Going to Crobar, we passed this kebab guy.   Kebab Guy:  You two are sisters and they're Filipino, right? Me:  What? KG:  You two are sisters? Me:  Yeah KG:  Twins? Me:  No KG:  They're Filipino, right? ME:  Yeah  When I read that back, I realized how un-funny it might sound, but it was hysterical at the time, and no one had been drinking.

      I started a blog a few months ago but I didn't update it a lot, and it pretty much got stale, so I decided to start over.  So many things have changed in the last 6 months.   December 10th: the love of my life died  January 6th: went to Nassau  April 2nd: back to SA  April 22nd: moved to DC with no job  June 1st: started new job    So much has happened that I haven't really had time to think. Everything is slowly starting to hit me now.   I'm getting more tense and apprehensive about my birthday coming up. It's the first birthday without my mom. I remember last year clearly. It was a Friday, and I always drove up from Houston on Fridays. I got home and then had to go out and get my own birthday cake. That's always weird. Buying your own cake. It's like I'm a loser who no one will take care of even on her birthday.   We had a bunch of old people over to the house to watch the Spurs game (they lost), I got in a fight with Papa over the game, and both Mummy and Mom fed me cake and kissed me on each cheek for pictures. God, I miss her so much.   I miss the mischevious sparkle in her eyes, the impish grin, the way she'd stick out her tongue in a devilish way.  You can't even begin to imagine how I feel. I know it's a day to day process that takes time, but it seems as if the more time passes, the harder it gets.   Sunday is going to be hard. I don't want to do anything. It's not like I want to be depressed. I'm just sad. I can't pretend to enjoy myself or be happy.   I'm prone to suicidal thoughts, and it's starting to get to me. At least I have a new job to keep me occupied. Lord knows what might happen if I didn't have anything.

      "If I was arrested for armed robbery and my mug shot was on the television screen, people wouldn't be debating if I was African-American or not. I'd be a black man going to jail. Now if that's true when bad things are happening, there's no reason why I shouldn't be proud of being a black man when good things are happening, too." -- Barak Obama

      8:00 a.m. Wake up. Wonder where you are.   8:01 a.m. Realize you are lying on 100 percent cotton sheets of at least a 300 count, so don't panic; you're not slumming.   8:02 a.m. Realize you are actually in your own bed for a change. Wake stranger next to you and tell them you are late for work so won't be able to cook breakfast for them. Mutter "sorry" as you help him look for his far-flung underwear. You find out that you tore his boxers while ripping them off him last night, so you "loan" him a pair of boxer-briefs, but not the new ones because you never intend to see him again.   8:05 a.m. Tell the stranger, whose name eludes you, "It was fun. I'll give you a call," as you usher him out the door, avoiding his egregious morning-breath.   8:06 a.m. Crumple and dispose of the piece of paper with his telephone number on it when you get to the kitchen.   8:07 a.m. Make a high protein breakfast while watching the Today show. Wonder if the stories you've heard about Matt Lauer are true. Decide they must be.   8:30 a.m. Italian or domestic? Decide to go with three-button Italian and the only shirt that is clean.   8:45 a.m. Climb into red Miata and try not to look too much like Barbie driving one of her accessories as you pull out of your underground parking. Revos or Armanis? Go with Revos.   9:35 a.m. Stroll into office.   9:36 a.m. Close door to office and call best friend and laugh about the guy who spent the night at your condo. Point out something annoying about best friend's boyfriend but quickly add "It doesn't matter what everyone else thinks, just as long as you love him."   10:15 a.m. Leave office, telling your secretary you are "meeting with a client." Pretend not to notice her insubordinate roll of her eyes (or the cloying "poem" she has tacked to her cubicle wall).   10:30 a.m. Hair appointment for lowlights and cut. Purchase of Aveda anti-humectant pomade.   11:30 a.m. Run into personal trainer at gym. Pester him about getting you Human Growth Hormone. Spend 30 minutes talking to friends on your cell phone while using Hammer Strength machines, preparing a mental-matrix of which circuit parties everyone is going to and which are now passe.   12:00pm Tan. Schedule back-waxing in time for Saturday party where you know you will end up shirtless.   12:30 p.m. Pay trainer for anabolic steroids and schedule a workout. Shower, taking ten minutes to knot your tie while you check-out your best friend's boyfriend undress with the calculation of someone used to wearing a t-back and having dollars stuffed in their crotch.   1:00 p.m. Meet someone for whom you only know his waist, chest and penis size from AOL M4M chat for lunch at a hot, new restaurant. Because the maître d' recognizes you from a gay bar, you are whisked past the Christian heterosexual couples who have been waiting patiently for a table since 12:30.   2:30 p.m. "Dessert at your place." Find out, once again, people lie on AOL.   3:33 p.m. Assume complete control of the U.S., state, and local governments (in addition to other nations' governments); destroy all healthy Christian marriages; recruit all children grades Kindergarten through 12 into your amoral, filthy lifestyle; secure complete control of the media, starting with sitcoms; molest innocent children; give AIDS to as many people as you can; host a pornographic "art" exhibit at your local art museum; and turn people away from Jesus, causing them to burn forever in Hell.   4:10 p.m. Time permitting, bring about the general decline of Western Civilization and look like you are having way too much fun doing it.   4:30 p.m. Take a disco-nap to prevent facial wrinkles from the stress of world conquest and being so terribly witty.   6:00 p.m. Open a fabulous new bottle of Malbec.   6:47 P.M. Bake Ketamine for weekend. Test recipe.   7:00 P.M. Go to Abercrombie & Fitch.   7:40 P.M. Stop looking at the photographic displays at Abercrombie & Fitch and actually begin shopping.   8:30 p.m. Light dinner with catty homosexual friends at a restaurant you will be "over" by the time it gets its first review in the local paper.   10:30 p.m. Cocktails at a debauched gay bar, trying to avoid alcoholic queens who can't navigate a crowd with a lit cigarette in one hand and a Stoli in a cheap plastic cup in the other. Make audible remark about how "trashy" people who still think smoking is acceptable are.   12:00 a.m. "Nightcap at your place." Find out that people lie in bars, too.

      don't i have a job or something?  damn.  i think that ending it is a gigantic mistake.  distance amplifies everything.  i was in this mindset yesterday where i didn't want to believe anything that made him less than the biggest asshole who ever lived.  a restless night of sleep and words from up above made me reconsider.  the whole situation is complicated, and i need to just be quiet and listen to what i feel inside.  anytime i think about forgiveness, the picture flashes in my mind.  ok, who am i kidding?  i see that picture in my head all the time.  it makes me ill.  how would he have felt if it was me?  i don't want to see him in pain or even know that he  is  in pain.  i'm used to being in pain, and i can handle it.  i just don't want to see anyone else like that.  he wants a break.  i am not going to beg.  i am not pathetic.  i am, however, a complete wreck.  _______________________________________________________________________  "The weak can never forgive.

      i had a dream last night...actually, this morning.  i woke up at like 6:30 and went into that state of i-think-i'm-awake-so-this-must-be-real.  anyway, i dreamt i was talking to him and he was telling me about a threesome he had with her and some other chick.  i don't know who the other one was (but if it was angelina jolie i would have been beyond jealous.  i mean, i'm jealous of  urlLink Queen Noor! ), but it was a threesome.  i woke up feeling horrible.  i want to talk to him so badly, because i want to smooth things out.  i'm not saying i want to fix it or forget or anything.  i don't know what's going on.  i just know that i feel empty.  i know what he's going through with his mother, and maybe it's a curse to care for people blindly, but that's what mummy taught me to do.  at least i can be there for him as a person who went through it, but not as a girlfriend.    i have forgiven a million times worse.

       If it's true that the Kings offered the Lakers C-Webb and Bobby Jackson as starting point for a Shaq deal, Mitch Kupchak is a fool ...   No. It wouldn't be Kupchak who's a fool. It would be Petrie.   Didn't we learn anything from the Jimmy Jackson mistake??? Much better for him in the long run, because he's kicking ass in Houston, but we let him go when we shouldn't have. I seriously don't think C-Webb is the problem. You can't put a whole franchise on him when he comes back early from a debilitating injury.   Plus, B-Jax is the heart of our team. No one tries harder (and I'm Bibby's biggest fan) and no one wants to win more. His injury is tricky, but he can come back from it...especially with all this time off.   That being said, the ending to the Kings season couldn't have been more representative of the entire season. C-Webb taking a desperation 3 that ended up being an airball. That man might possibly break my heart every season.

       he's going out tonight. didn't say with whom, but of course i think she's gonna be there, and of course i think he's still not being completely honest with me despite everything. he says they don't talk anymore and he's making concrete plans to come here, but i still have this nagging feeling. i'm turning into the thing i hate...a distrustful person who is suspicious all the time. if he was here, i'd be able to know where he goes, and she won't be a problem, but i don't want to be that controlling person. that person who has to know where you are all the time and who you're with. ugh. maybe this whole thing  is  doomed after all.   i don't know why i got my hopes up again.

       1. Never, under any circumstances, take a sleeping pill and a laxative on the same night.   2. If you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race has not achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential, that word would be "meetings."   3. There is a very fine line between "hobby" and "mental illness."   4. People who want to share their religious views with you almost never want you to share yours with them.   5. You should not confuse your career with your life.   6. Nobody cares if you can't dance well. Just get up and dance.   7. Never lick a steak knife.   8. The most destructive force in the universe is gossip.   9. You will never find anybody who can give you a clear and compelling reason why we observe daylight savings time.   10. You should never say anything to a woman that even remotely suggests that you think she's pregnant unless you can see an actual baby emerging from her at that moment.   11. There comes a time when you should stop expecting other people to make a big deal about your birthday. That time is age eleven.   12. The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age, gender, religion, economic status or ethnic background, is that, deep down inside, we ALL believe that we are above average drivers.   13. A person, who is nice to you, but rude to a waiter, is not a nice person. (This is very important. Pay attention. It never fails.)   14. Your true friends love you anyway, even if you are rude to waiters.   15. Never be afraid to try something new. Remember that a lone amateur built the Ark. A large group of professionals built the Titanic.   16. Men are like fine wine.. They start out as grapes, and it's up to the women to stomp the crap out of them until they turn into something acceptable to have dinner with.    final thought for the day   There is more money being spent on breast implants and Viagra than on Alzheimer's research. This means that by 2030, there should be a large elderly population with perky boobs and huge erections and absolutely no recollection of what to do with them.

       Charles will still be a fan, but damn. The Spurs can't be stupid enough to let him get away. I know he can be inconsistent at times, but he's more of a role player and complete energizer than anyone else on that team. He's like Najera but GOOD. Seriously, Tim cannot let that happen. I'd rather Tony leave than Manu.

      I had a best friend in college who I simply adored.  He was really nice, sweet, completely ridiculous, and the funniest person I have ever known.  He's so talented and I have always been his biggest fan and cheerleader.  The usual happened.  I fell in love, and he didn't.  I don't doubt he had feelings for me, but I guess timing wasn't right.  Who knows?  About a year after we met, my gay best friend came back from his fellowship in DC and we had to make up for lost time (we stopped talking for a reason so stupid, I'm embarrassed to mention it), so my friend got jealous and we stopped hanging out as much as we used to.    Anyway, before I graduated, he met a girl and they started dating.  He and I fell out of touch and their relationship just blossomed.  They dated for 3 years and just broke up.  He's obviously heartbroken about it.  We got back in touch just recently when their relationship was suffering.  So, the whole point of this is that he's coming in town from NYC this weekend to help his sister move.  I haven't seen him since graduation (about 2 and a half years ago) and I'm nervous.  I'm not still in love with him.  I mean, it took me ages, but I got over him eventually.  He's like my little brother now.  I just believe in him so much and I can't wait to see him realize how incredibly talented he is.    I'm just nervous.  I don't know why.

      I think about what life would be like if one event was different.  I wonder how many times what I thought was a simple choice could have been a life changing moment, like in 'Sliding Doors'.  What if I had stayed in Tokyo instead of moving to Nassau?  Well, I might not have developed my love for chocolate men...hmm, that would suck.  But maybe I would have actually gone somewhere with that mini-modelling thing.  I would have been fluent in Japanese...maybe I would have had a completely different career.  I know I would have been more independent.  How would my personality differ?  I'd probably have a funny accent when I spoke English.  I'd probably be skinny and wouldn't even know about Dr. Atkins.  I'd probably really like cuttlefish.  What if I had gone to high school in Nassau and not moved to TX until college?  I'd have a weird accent, but I'd probably have gotten more ass in college because of it.    What if I had gone to G-town instead of UT?  I can't imagine not being a Horns fan, but how would I have been different?  Chocolate city...mmm.  What if I made a big mistake by taking this job and not going on the campaign trail?  I would have met more people, seen more things, and done something important.  I mean, I love my job.  I love that I'm learning so much.  I love the women I work with.  Most of all, I love the days I get to go to the Senate, because Senate cops and security people are hot as shit.    I'm feeling restless.  One of the reasons I turned down the campaign job was because I wanted some sort of stability for awhile.  I've moved 5 times in the last 2 years.  I don't want to leave again.  I think being so far away from Mummy's body is starting to get to me.  I can't wait to be home and visit her.  I know she's always with me, and every morning I wake up and see her smiling face, but god damnit, it's not the same.  No more phone calls for ridiculous reasons.  No more 'happy birthday' calls from wherever she is at the time.  No more cuddling.  No more 'elbow game'.  No more arguments.  No more 'aerobics'.  No more homemade chinese food.  No more advice.  No more silliness.    It's like a wound that scabs over, but won't ever heal.    I always believe that things happen for a reason, but that you don't fully understand why until way later.  I don't believe in fate, because of free will.  If it's fated, then you don't have responsibility for or control over anything.    I just wonder when I'll realize what ridiculous reason God had for taking away the most important person in my life.

      I wish I could save the world.  I see so much hurt and sorrow, but there's nothing I feel like I can do.  It makes me feel better to boycott fast food places and Starbucks and Wal-mart, but in the end, there's not much that I can do as an individual.    Corporations and powerful people with deep pockets rule this world.  They don't just buy and sell products and stocks, they buy and sell people.  The weakest among us are the ones most easily and most often exploited.  They don't have a voice, and it's our responsibility to speak for them.  How can we consider ourselves to be the world's savior when all we do as a country is rape and pillage?  When you get a chance, go see  urlLink The Corporation .  I can't adequately describe how I feel about all of this.  You just need to see it.  Don't let the almost 3 hour length of the movie dissuade you from going.

      i'm all for a multi-party system.  i don't think it's fair that only democrats and republicans have a say.  still, i hate nader for a variety of reasons.  anyway, i was looking up some other presidential candidates and i found the libertarian platform.  it's great to want the 'war on drugs' to end because it's racist and ineffective.  it's great to remind voters that the administration lied to us about the war.  it's wonderful to be pro-choice and to want to increase funding for veterans' benefits.  however, you completely lose all credibility when you list  urlLink reasons republicans should vote libertarian .  3rd parties love to talk about the two major parties going negative and how there need to be positive options.  apparently, that line of thinking doesn't apply to themselves.  the worst part is that a lot of these third party candidates are so full of themselves.  they think that they're the savior for all of the problems in this country.  it's bullshit.  instead of wrapping themselves in the flag, like republicans, they wrap themselves in a cloak of hypocrisy and self-righteousness.  no one is looking out for the weak among us because everyone is looking out for themselves.  at least some people are upfront about it.

What did he find at the end of that motorcade?"  really??  do we give a shit whether he's happy or not?  first of all, he ain't the cute little kid he was back then.  that's enough to lose my attention.  second, if he were from haiti, we would never have heard his story.  leave the kid alone and while you're at it, stop the  urlLink embargo .

       urlLink You need to be quiet . All you talked about in this damn article was how errone else fell off, but then deflected when asked if you were soft. You did NOT have to come back early from your knee injury if you weren't at full strength. We were the number one team in the league...no, not just the conference...the LEAGUE...until your stank ass came back. Now, you're talking about laughing and giggling before important games and how YOU ain't finna tolerate it?  OH HELL NO. I am tired of your aw-shucks-maybe-if-i-just-smile-errone-will-forgive-me-lying-about-taking-money-trying-to-be-the-teflon-player-in-the-league BULLSHIT! You are no longer the heart and soul of this team, and you haven't been a defensive presence in a long ass time. Don't hate because Brad Miller surpassed all expectations and became the go-to guy in important situations! He's an All-Star! When was the last time yo ass was an All-Star? YOU MISSED THE GAME WINNING SHOT IN GAME 7 SO I DON'T WANNA HEAR JACK ABOUT HOW PEOPLE AIN'T IN IT TO WIN IT!  "I'm not going to name no damned names. I'm not going to embarrass no man. But I made a comment so they would know. I challenged them for over the summer. People who I'm talking to know. And the people who think I'm talking to them and I'm not, then they need to look at themselves anyway, just to make some type of change, because then they must be speaking honestly to themselves."  Enough of this passive aggressive crap. You love talking about how certain people need to "be a man". Why don't you start first before callin them out? At least you could have the balls to admit that you ARE soft. Not everyone has to be street all the time. You don't hear a word out of Tim Duncan when he gets called soft. Real men don't see that as an insult!  I am getting tired of your ass. I don't care how fine you are.   but damn...you really are fine.
