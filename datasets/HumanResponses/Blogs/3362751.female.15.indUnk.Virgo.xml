      I read my posts from earlier and they are really sad. I'm even more emo than I thought. I'm not usually like that or least I don't think so anyway. School just makes me crazy. Matt read the post I wrote to him and he flipped out. He wants bash my head in with a hammer, or maybe he just run me over with his car a couple times. Oh well, I don't care. I am going to go to school tomorrow. wow, can you believe it? It's Sam's birthday and I think you all should buy her stuff. I heard she really likes amateur porn. So everyone, get out your video cameras and have some hot, passionate,intercourse. I'm going to take lots of pictures at school and post them on deviant Art. Rhondahead2083.deviantart.com HAPPY BIRTHDAY SAMANTHA! Don't forget to get crunked or at least eat lots of cake!

      I didn't go to school today but I'm sure you could have guessed that. I haven't even left my house at all. I am so lazy. I need to find something to do. After tomorrow there is one week and 2 days of school left. I say, FUCK SCHOOL, I don't even care anymore. I know how this is going to end, and so does everyone else so why don't I just do whatever the hell I want to. It's not like they are going to kick me out now that it's so close to being over and even if they do.... So what? It doesn't matter. Nothing really matters. I don't really do much of anything. I don't go to school, I have no goals, no dreams, no interests,no hobbies, no life.

      I finally quit my piano lessons today. It was a waste of time and a waste of money. I didn't really go to school today. I thought it was a late start. I went to like one class today. That's horrible. I should have just stayed home. I don't know if I can go back to school. Honestly, I'm really scared. There's only a week or so left but my English teacher is going to kill me.  I don't know why I find her so intimidating. She's short, skinny and pregnant.. I haven't been to math in like 3 weeks and my history teacher secretly wishes I would fall off a cliff or something. Everyone is freaking out today. They are driving me nuts. One minute they are happy and the next they are ready to blow someone's head off.   I don't really know where to start but this is something I have to say. Matt, I hope you get a chance to read this because it's important and I hope you are not angry that I used your real name but I think using a fake one is pretty stupid and everyone who is going to read this already knows how I feel. so that leaves you the only person who doesn't know. This is long over due and it's time that I stop leading you on, letting you think that there could actually be something besides friendship between us.I know I should have told you before but it's hard when are pouring out these crazy emotions and confessing your love. I refuse to believe that you are in love with me. We hardly ever talk. I mean, I talk to my boyfriend for like 6 hours everyday. I have a hard time holding a conversation with you for more than 5 minutes. You used to be happy and fun to hang out with and easy to talk to but now its seems like you're nothing more than an heartbroken emo kid. Why would you want to ruin the friendship that we used to have. You've changed so much. I miss the old Matt. The matt who I could talk to, who I could hang out with. Remember when we ditched school and you were trying to play it cool but you were actually freaking out because you let Chelsea drive your car and she only had a permit or when we went to the distillers concert and none of us but you were old enough to get in. Don't you miss all those Sunday mornings at village inn??? I'm telling you right now you need to get over me and move on. I'm not THAT cool. You'll find someone who is right for you, and believe me that person is not me. I don't understand how you can be all (emo)tional over me, when you are doing the exact same thing, if not worse to Sam. She always thought you were one of the greatest people that she knows but then you went and lead her on. Why didn't you just tell her from the very beginning. She just wants to know that you actually care, that you want to be friends, that you aren't just some jerk. Just go up to her and talk to her. She's not mad at you or anything she just wants to know the truth.   I hope we will be friends for a long time but I'm just telling you that you need to get over this sappy bullshit. What you do about Sam, well that's your choice but I know you'll do the right thing.;-)

      I didn't go to school yesterday. I missed most of my classes today. When my parents find out that I've been missing so much school they are going to  slaughter  me. I do this every year and I always think things are going to get better. I think that I'll go to school, get get good grades and at least try to do the right thing. but nooo not me... I can't do that. Nothing ever changes. It just gets worse. If I drop out I don't know what I'll do. There's not really anything I  can  do. Even if I end up staying in school, I'm just not good at anything or smart enough to do anything. It's just a waste of time, a waste of a life.   I talked to the psychologist guy today. He gave me these weird things for my parents to fill out. The questions are actually pretty funny. eats things that are not food... never sometimes often or always?? I think I'll just fill them out myself and give them back to him tomorrow. My mom saw it and one of the questions is about drugs and she was trying to tell me that  she sees me taking pills all the time. What kind of pills? Where do I get these so called "pills" from? Am I in denial? No, she's just crazy. My parents are so bizarre.  Yesterday was Leon's birthday. Chelsea and I got him this card that said "the birthday raisin wants to wish you a happy birthday" and on the inside there was this scary paper raisin. I don't really get it but we thought it was funny and I think he did too. We took him to this cafe that he's been wanting to go to. He drank coffee Chelsea had this weird Italian soda and of course, I ate. It was an okay day. ANYTHING is better than going to school. It seemed like he really appreciated us picking him up. He's a nice guy. I don't know why he hangs out with Brian or Denny. They are the total opposite of him. They are loud, obnoxious, and mean. Maybe he likes it when people make fun of him. Oh well, whatever floats your boat?  Well, I guess that's all... It's kinda sad I have nothing else to talk about except for school?? I guess I think about other stuff, but I don't really have strong opinions about anything. Mostly I just worry about things. I need to quit smoking already... Smoking intoxicates your lungs! Seriously folks er... Cayce, Sam, and Niki Don't ever start smoking or I will hurt you.

      My name is Heather and this is my "blog" I still don't know exactly what that means. These things seem more like diaries than anything else. I don't know why I made this and it probably won't last very long. My life is pretty boring. I am 15 years old and I think I am about to drop out of school, either that or get kicked out. I go to school everyday but I don't exactly go to all of my classes. There is rarely a day when I make it to every single one of them. Even when I do attend it's like I'm just not there. I sit and daydream or sleep or draw and most of my teachers don't care anymore. They realize there's no point in trying to help me. Tomorrow I have to go talk to the school shrink. He is going to tell me whether I am depressed or not, or at least I think that's what I'm going to see him for. I honestly don't think I am but what do I know? Absolutely nothing.I don't know why I even go to school anymore... I guess to see my boyfriend? That's what the shrink tells me anyway. It's actually kind of funny. I never have boyfriends. The thought of one is actually kind of gross, but I really like Cayce and that's all that matters... I guess. It's actually kind of weird that he likes me. He is really smart and incredibly talented and he's going to go to college and do something with his life, which is actually the complete opposite of me. I'm not very smart and although not completely un-talented (I play the guitar and the piano) music just doesn't interest me as much as it used to and I'm really not that great at it. As far as school goes, once I drop out I don't know what I'll do. Sometimes I feel like I'd be better off dead. At least my parents wouldn't have to be disappointed in me anymore. It's just one failure and disappointment after the other. If I could just die I wouldn't have to be miserable. not that I'm exactly miserable right now but I'm not ever going to get a decent job or get married or have kids or anything like that. but anyway... Enough about the future. Now I'll babble about..... the present, my weekend? I don't know, On Friday I hung out with Cayce until 11:00pm and then my friend Chelsea (you'll hear more about her later) picked me up and we went with this kid Leon to Waffle house where we spent a few good hours  playing some weird game and smoking then we drove around aimlessly until finally we ended up in a parking lot someplace, where we spent the night or I guess I should say morning. We finally left at 5:30 am. I don't really remember what I did on Saturday during the day but Cayce's brother picked me up around 8:30. I don't remember much but maybe that's because I was wasted. For some reason Cayce's brother offered me liquor which was probably not such a good idea because apparently I drank more than I should have and more than I could handle. I made a total ass of myself but at least my parents didn't find out. I got home and went to my room. I threw up more than I ever have in my entire life. That night I laughed and I cried and I danced and I sang and I acted like an idiot but oh well it's not like there's anything I can do about it now. Today (Sunday).... well at least I think It's still Sunday, I hung out with cayce again and we went to ihop I am too tired to remember anything else. I should be asleep already. I have to wake up so early tomorrow. I think I'm done talking now. If none of this made sense, then fuck you because I really don't care.

      I HATE EVEYONE. Cayce is going to Mexico for an entire week. Do you realize how much this sucks? NO, I don't think you do. I am going to be COMPLETELY alone. I'm not over-exaggerating. I will have noone to talk to except for this stupid blog that I am starting to hate and that noone reads. Did I mention I hate everyone? Why doesn't anyone like me? I mean, why wouldn't they? I'm so... cool? Okay, so maybe cool isn't the right word, but there has to be someone who wants to be my friend.  Cayce is cool. He's like my only friend in the entire world. It's not the same as having a close chick-friend, but oh well. TOO BAD FOR ME, HUH? He's close enough.  Okay, so I cut my hair and I hate it. Maybe I should just shave my head. It doesn't really matter now though because I won't be seeing anyone for at least a week. Maybe by then it will grow back a little. Probably not, but whatever.   Have you ever seen that one commercial where there's like all those people working in an office or something and it goes, "Nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach, diarrhea. Hey, Pepto Bismol!" It kind of scares me.  I watch too much TV. I watch (but am not limited to): Becker, King of Queens, Seinfeld, The Simpsons, Mad About You, Just Shoot Me, The Golden Girls, Teen Titans (hey, its on like everyday,) Elimidate, Girls Behaving Badly, Sunday Night Sex Show, Berman & Berman, Punk'd, Family Feud, Boiling Points, Third Rock From the Sun, The Cosby Show, Hey Arnold, and Ricki Lake.  WHOA! HOLY SHIT that's a lot of TV.  I went "bowling" tonight. I suck at bowling. I suck at everything. It's okay I'm good at....... eating and sleeping, and playing my guitar and DANCING and I'm really good at Sonic Heros  Well if anyone ever happens to read this and you are so totally bored out of your mind. Just IM me I'll talk to ANYONE GOOD BYE

      Hi.  Guess what? I got my computer fixed.  I'm pretty sure that nobody noticed because you all are dirty disgusting cunt whores.   I am currently in a state of confusion. I don't know what is going to happen next. I fell down the stairs. Haha not really, got ya. HAHAHA. HAHAHAHA. I am in the library. GOT YA AGAIN. HAHAHA. But really, I don't have a life, I'm not cool enough for the library. I need some friends. I am so lonely. PLEASE BE MY FRIEND! My AIM name is PEANATOPRINCESS and if you don't IM me I will hunt you down and slaughter you and your whole family. I have only 3 momos. Do you know what a momo is? Well in Japanese it means peach but to me momo means friend.  Patrick Swayzee,         You are crazy.               Sincerely,              Your number one Gopalope,              Rere Fernandez  OMG, I can't believe it. OMG OMG SCHOOL IS OVER. I made it!  But not really. I haven't been to school in like 2 weeks. Haha, guess what I did? I fingerbanged a gopalope named Cayce... twice. Actually, just kidding. It was only once. Hahahaha.   So, you people know nothing about me. And so, I will tell you about myself. Well, my birthday is September 18th - oh my god, don't forget to get me a stripper. My eyes are naturally the color of something that you found underneath your shoe, and smells really bad, and came from an animal, however, I wear a pair of beautiful purple contacts, and as of today, I haven't taken them out for an entire week. My skin is the same color as my eyes, and probably from the same animal. I am a dirty Mexican. And by dirty, I mean  dirty , like as in I haven't showered for two years. I have many hobbies and interests, such as eating, sleeping, watching clown porn, eating, sleeping, playing my guitar, eating, sleeping, fantasizing about Ted Danson, Mel Gibson, Elvis Presley and all those other Capricorn hotties, eating, sleeping, more eating, and eating while sleeping and vice versa. Occasionally, I smoke cigarettes. Cigarettes are nasty. I am nasty. My brother is in a Jewish car sleeping. Haha, I tricked you, I don't have a brother! Haha, tricked you again. Actually I do, his name is Carlos, and he is mexican too. Can you believe that?? TWO MEXICANS in ONE family!  There is more to me than just eating and sleeping, but not much. I talk to Cayce for way too long, probably about four and a half or five hours a day. How have I not got tired of that weird boy yet? Do you realize that in one month, I have talked to him for about 120 hours??? OMG. There must be something wrong with me. I don't like people especially not little people. Oh well, whatever floats my emo boat.  I guess that's all for now, but I assure you there will be many more posts for all of my wonderful readers and I'm sure I have about a million of them because I am so incredibly awesome and you all wish you could be exactly like me. Thank you.

      Sometimes I feel like there's something seriously wrong with me. It's like no matter how hard I try I will never be good enough... good enough for my parents, good enough for my friends, good enough for Cayce, good enough for myself. I am just a retarded fucking moron. Why can't I ever just do the right thing? I hate myself, i am disgusting. I'm not just feeling sorry for myself, well okay maybe I am but it's the truth. I can't stand myself. Somebody please shoot me.

       Wow, I can't believe it's already august. I haven't blogged in a long time but not much has happened since the last one I wrote. I ran away last week. It was only for like two days and it was pretty lame but I seriously needed to get away for a while. I left my house about 1:00 am and went to cayce's. 5 hours later my parents were already harassing all of my friends. They found out where I was "hiding" and drove over there. Lucky for me I was already gone. The cops went to his house searched it, and harassed the hell out of him. When they were done doing that, they sat outside in their car for like 3 hours. I fucking hate cops. After I left Cayce's I walked around aimlessly with no where to go. I finally found somewhere I could stay and I called my parents and told them I was okay. They were more angry than concerned but whatever. They had this crazy idea that im pregnant, I don't know how they came to this conclusion... They found a condom in my room but wouldn't that mean that I'm probably  not  pregnant and what were they doing snooping around my room anyway?! Things have gotten better, I don't feel like a prisoner anymore. The parentals don't trust me but it's not like they ever did to begin with.      I feel like writing more but the problem is, I have nothing to write about. My life is so BORING. I guess my life only sucks because I let it suck. If you you want something you have to go out and get it you can't wait for it to come to you. All I do is eat and eat and eat and eat. I keep getting fatter and fatter each day. I am 5'4 and I weigh 125lbs. I would like to weigh 115 but I don't think I'll be losing any weight. I like to eat too much for that. I need to get out and do something or find a new hobby. I don't really play my guitar anymore. I don't even try. It's like that with most things I do, I get to a certain point and then I stop trying to get better and eventually, I just quit.       Yesterday, my dad bought a canary. It's yellow and orange and white. I just hope he doesn't buy anymore. That's the way it starts, one cute little bird and then just a few more and then you're buying them by the dozens and they reproduce. Soon, youre stuck with 200 birds. I'm not joking, it's a true story. My dad is insane.   Well I'm tired so whatever, I'll write again tomorrow or something.
