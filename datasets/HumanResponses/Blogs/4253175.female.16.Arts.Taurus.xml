      Sorry about my long disappearance off the face of the 'net. Plenty of things have happened to keep me busy during these last few months, but ph33r not, I am alive, and I'm back in business again!  Let me fill you in on what's happened over my period of absence.  I've finished my GCSE exams and ended my tuition with Robbie, but I'm still waiting for my results, they'll come on the 26th, I'm told. I hope I did ok, since I think I fudged a few of the exams, like the maths, and I didn't manage to finish the piece I did for my 10-fucking-hour art exam. I reckon I'll get A-C grades, which is fine, since all I need to qualify for college is four C grades.  I also went to the court case I had in July. For those who don't remember, I was assaulted last May by a young lady (read: nasty little scrotmonster), namely Jade Y. Brown, and her group of teenage thug wannabees. She hit me once in the nose with a bottle o' coke, and twice in the ribcage with a wooden baseball bat. The case had been postponed twice already, once due to Ms. Brown's attending court without an adult, and the second time was down to the court. Since I didn't really wanna see Jade's ugly mug in court, they said I could use the video link system in Brighton court instead of attending Worthing court. So me and Mike dragged our arses out of bed at 7:00 AM to get to this court case, and what do we find out, 10 minutes before I'm supposed to go into the room? Tina, one of my ex-friends and witness to the incident, has "forgotten" that she needed to be there. Dumb bitch, metinks. So I'm practically chewing my fingers off, thinking the whole thing was going to be re-adjourned yet again. But thankfully, Tina was able to get her stupid arse over to Worthing courts to testify. And, funnily enough, we got a guilty plea! All I had to do was go into the video room with Emeline, the other witness and my backstabbing cunt of an ex-best friend, and listen to the judge say thanks for us being there, and telling us the result. Pretty non-stressful, considering the state I'd worked myself up into by that point. All ended well, and, as I have now been notified, Jade has been sentenced to 6 months monitoring and community service - kinda like probation, I guess - and she owes me £30. But she hasn't payed me yet. Bitch.  Since then, not much else has happened worth mentioning. I've been hunting for jobs with my friend Matt, but no luck. The bastards just take my CV, then don't call me back. So at the moment, I am still unemployed and lacking pocky. Apart from that, I've just been struggling with Mike's scanner, which refuses to work, and trying to work on my website, in between 3 hour blocks of playing on the XBox and Gamecube. Oh, and we've got tickets to a gig playing at the Concorde II in Brighton - Mortiis, Susperia, and some crap hardcore band called Killing Mode are playing. Pretty good for £9, metinks. At least Mortiis will be cool. I hear he puts on a good show. The gig is on the 25th of September - if any of you guys are going along, drop me an email.  Now, I know what you're thinking. "Why on earth is she awake at nearly 5 in the morning?". Well, I had an obscenely late night this week. And I mean OBSCENELY - we didn't go to bed 'til 9 AM. And since then, I have become nocturnal - a habit I must break before college, otherwise I'm fux0r3d. So I shall be going to bed ASAP after I finish this.  At the moment, I have no projects to work on. If anyone is interested in doing an art trade, or hiring me for commission work *poke* *poke*, send me an email. As for the Disasterpieces website, it's still in the works, but it's coming along. Patience, grasshopper. It will be there soon.  Oyasumi nasai. I'm off to bed.
