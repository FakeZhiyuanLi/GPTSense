        more quizzes...     urlLink          urlLink          urlLink       I found these quizzes from  urlLink Christina's  site.  She did the "what color are you" quiz and I didn't want to be just like her :-) so I did the other ones that I thought looked good.     What I think is funniest is that in the first quiz it says I'm a tulip,  "happy and honest"...but in the third quiz I'm a devil...heh heh heh...I guess that's because I'm a gemini and gemini's have "twin" personalities.   Anyway--I hope everyone is having a good Sunday!  I tried putting a "survey" up on my page, but the coding kept messing up the rest of the layout, so I'll have to look through the html and find out what I have in there that's bugging up the rest of it!!! Or I guess I could just post the survey in a regular blog post and not bother with the codes and stuff...hmmm...if I was reeeeeeeeeeeeally lazy I could do that!!! YEAH!!! SOUNDS GOOD!!!

        what's in YOUR name?   My friend  urlLink  Juls  found a cool  urlLink site  that tells you how your name can relate to what kind of person you are.  I did mine and even though I don't agree totally with everything they've said about me...some of it is true...here are my results:    Sarah     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your name of Sarah makes you easy-going and refined, but detracts from your physical vitality. You desire all the finer things in life--lovely clothes, home, furniture, and environment. However, procrastination is your worst enemy, and you find yourself lacking the ambition to make your dreams a reality. People are inclined to take advantage of your sympathetic, tractable nature. You naturally attract people with problems who seek your understanding and advice. You can give good advice although it is unlikely that you would follow it yourself. You would be most successful in situations where you can use your skills in diplomacy in handling people, but where you are not under pressure or required to carry responsibility and make decisions. It is difficult for you to be individual and make your own decisions, for you lack self-confidence. Your desire for sweet, rich foods could cause overweight, circulatory problems, or weakness in the kidneys.    Yesterday was a bit of fun! We spent the day at  urlLink Disneyland .  We have annual passes, so like I said in my Friday Five, we don't feel obligated to rush around and do everything humanly possible there in one day.  So when we first got there, we ambled around through all the cute little shops on Main Street, USA.  We found a bunch of cool Nightmare Before Christmas things and some cute Winnite The Pooh clothes and hats and stuff.  It was nice and relaxing.  We went on some rides too...some with Hannah together, and a couple we went on by ourselves, one at a time.  When I was on Space Mountain by myself, I got thrown up on...it was pretty gross.  Space Mountain is a dark roller coaster that's set in...well...space...and it's completely dark and you're flying around and all of a sudden it felt like a bird pooped on me...or maybe it was raining...but then I realized...wait a second...this is an indoor ride...and it was dark so I couldn't tell what hit me and then I figured it out...vomit.  HOW GROSS IS THAT? OHHH MAN I almost lost it...when I got off the ride I looked down and it was all over my t-shirt...so I ran into the bathroom and cleaned it up.  I walked out to where I was meeting Deane and Hannah and told him I would NEVER go on that ride again! UGH! Totally ruined my day LOL.  That's the third time someone has done that to me...my best friend threw up on me one night when she was maybe a little drunk...then at a carnival one year someone above me on a spinning ride threw up on me and my best friend.  *sigh*    Today we are supposed to go to the beach for a bbq...just the 3 of us.  I hope Deane wakes up soon so we can go.  We are also supposed to stop by and visit his mom in Woodland Hills and then go to Best Buy to get a disk reader for our digital camera so we can FINALLY download the 400 pictures we have on there.  Our digital camera stopped connecting to our computer about 6 months ago...so we have a bunch of pictures on there that we can't send people or print out ... word to the wise...don't waste your money on the  urlLink Polaroid MP3 Digital Camera ...not worth it... although it may look cool...ugh.

          friday five    I don't have much to post about today.  Today was just another average day and I don't want to be toooo repetitive in my blog...so I decided to try out the  urlLink Friday Five  again.   1. What are your favorite ways to relax and unwind?   I like reading books, going for walks, being by myself, watching a good tv show...or listening to music.   2. What do you do the moment you get home from work/school/errands?  When I get home from work, I normally either make something to eat or change out of my clothes.  Then I play with Hannah, eat dinner and relax.     3. What are your favorite aromatherapeutic smells?   Hmmm...I like lots of smells...I think my favorite smells though are vanilla, watermelon, lemon and raspberry...   4. Do you feel more relaxed with a group of friends or hanging out by yourself?   It depends on if it's my friends, or if they're people I dont' know too well.  When I'm with my friends, I am very relaxed, I can be "me" around them and they don't judge me and I don't "feel" like they're judging me.  When I'm around Deane's friends, who I don't know that well still, I feel a bit un-relaxed...they are all very nice, but I still don't know them too well, and when I'm around some of them, I feel the age difference between us, and I feel the fact that I have nothing in common with them, I didn't go to school with them, I don't know them at all really...and that makes me a bit uncomfortable.     5. What is something that you feel is relaxing but most people don't?   Hmmmm...I don't know.  I know of things that other people do to relax that I don't find relaxing...like smoking and drinking, and partying...a lot of people I know think of a relaxing weekend as going out and getting drunk or stoned and going crazy with parties ... and I don't find that relaxing at all...fun maybe (minus the smoking and stoned part!)...but definetly not relaxing.    I guess maybe I like going to Disneyland, I think that's relaxing and a lot of people don't.  But then again, I have an annual pass and never feel "obligated" to rush around and take in all the rides.  I can enjoy the littler things at the park, and sit under a tree or something with Deane and Hannah if we want.  Other people think I'm crazy when I say that we spent the day relaxing at Disneyland *smile*

        september 26th 2002   Today was soooo exhausting.  After a horrible day at work, we had to run errands.  We went to Target and I ALWAYS hate going in there.  Sure it's cheap, but for some reason, I always feel claustrophobic in places like Wal Mart, K Mart and Target.  After that we went to Costco, which is always fun.  We wandered through there, STARVING our heads off, getting ready to eat Hannah for lack of nothing better to eat...it was terrible.  We finally settled on pizza...for the second night in a row *half gag*  but hey...when you're hungry and too lazy to cook, pizza looks realy good.    I watched a bunch of good season premieres tonight.  Friends, CSI, ER, and Without A Trace were all excellent!!!  I wasn't toooo impressed with CSI:Miami, but then again, it was a stiff series premiere...so I'll give it another chance.  I still love the first one though...in Las Vegas.  What a sad life I have...only being interesting enough to talk about television shows...  I need such a life!

        bed tiiiime!    OK So I should be in bed...because I have a HOOOORRIBLE habit of over-sleeping...pushing my alarm clocks snoooooooze button to it's very last snoooooooze of the day...tonight I watched a pretty funny show.  It's rare that a new tv show debuts these days without sucking...but  urlLink Life With Bonnie  definetely made me laugh...Bonnie Hunt is one of my favorite actresses and this show is reaaaaally fun to watch!  I shall stay tuned *smile*  Other than that...not much :-)  Deane made yummmmmmy chicken fajitas tonight...we eat a lot of fajitas and tacos around here.  Tis' ok...he also made au gratin potatoes (When I was a kid I didn't care for them at all and would call them "rotten potatoes" ... my mom appreciated that quite a bit ... but now I like them ... so no more complaining)  She probably would serve them with something I didn't like though...like fish...or liver...but I don't know...I'm just making stuff up as I go here.    I feel like I should be doing something...I'm very energetic tonight for some reason...I'm in one of those moods where I feel so energetic like I could run the Boston Marathon...twice...and still have room left over for Bloomsday (My fellow Eastern Washingtonians know what Bloomsday is) However, I'm sure if those chances ever arose, I'd get to the starting line and plop down on the white line with a soda and a bag of chips to watch the *real* athletes do it!!!   I really wish I had the energy to re-do the stinkin' layout on my blog...I dont' like the dark colors anymore!!! But then I'd have to re-write all my links because I'm too lazy to just change the background on the template I already have.  Gosh I'm so lazy.  I need to stop complaining.  I'm one of "those" people tonight.  "Mrs. Negative"  "Mrs. Cynical"  "Mrs. Nasty Attitude"   *blah*!!!!!!!!!!!

        watch out for the ducks!     Three women die together in an accident and go to Heaven. When they get there, St.Peter says,"We have only one rule here in Heaven...don't step on any ducks." So, they enter Heaven and sure enough, there are ducks all over the place. It is almost impossible not to step on any ducks. Although they try their best to avoid them, the first woman accidentally steps on a duck. Along comes St.Peter with the ugliest man she ever saw. St.Peter chains them together and says,"Your punishment for stepping on a duck is to spend all eternity chained to this man!" The next day, the second woman accidentally steps on a duck, and along comes St.Peter with another extremely ugly man. He chains them together with the same punishment as the first woman! The third woman has observed all this and, not wanting to be chained for all eternity to an ugly man, is VERY VERY careful where she steps. She manages to go months without stepping on any ducks. One day St.Peter comes up to her with the most handsome man she has ever laid eyes on....very tall, muscular, tan and with great hair. St.Peter chains them together without saying a word and walks away.  The woman looks at the man and remarks,"I wonder what I did to deserve being chained to you for all eternity!!!"  And the guy says,"Well, I don't know what you did, but I stepped on a  duck!"

         not a whole lot goin' on!    *sigh*  I don't really have much to post!!!  Today was an average day.  Woke up late (as usual), went to work, worked, came home, and vegged out...*sigh* That's my life in a nutshell.  So I'm not going to bore the readers with anymore senseless ramblings.

        "does someone have a case of the mondays???"   heh heh heh...gotta love that movie!  Today I worked alone for the most part.  My colleague that normally works with me had the day off for her birthday.  It went by soooooo much faster than I thought it would...I figured if I was alone that I wouldn't have anyone to talk to and I'd be bored...but it was just the opposite...I had lots to do and lots of people to talk to.    I've been following this  urlLink story  about the mom who beat her 4 year old in a department store in Illinois...totally makes me sick to my stomach to imagine anyone hurting a little kid like that.  What could that kid have possibly done to deserve it?  The lawyer claims the child was running around the store taking toys out of boxes and making a scene...so what?  Put her in a stroller...or a shopping cart...don't beat the holy crap out of her!!!  Hannah can be a MOOOOOOONSTER sometimes...and there are times where I tell her "You are driving mommy NUTS!" But I would NEVER EVER EVER do any sort of bodily harm to her!  She's just way to sweet and way too innocent to want to harm!!!     UNTIL SHE STARTS CLIMBING ON THE FILING BOX FOR THE MILLIONTH TIME!!! UGH she just fell off of it and rolled across the floor... got up and started laughing about it.  *shaking my head in disbelief*  *sigh*    Will try to post more later...I just found out my mom reads this and doesn't say hi on my tagboard or the comments section so I didn't know she was here *GASP*  Guess I better stop with the dirty talk...LOL Just kidding...

       friend update   We found our missing friend.  The one that was supposed to move in with me on 9/8/02 but never showed up, never called...I was sooo upset that she would leave us out to dry like that and worried at the same time...our friend Myra finally tracked her down...she IS back in Washington living at home ... her mom says she's just really distraught and feeling like a failure and has been too embarrassed to contact us...HELLO...she was supposed to move in with me...a little understanding would go along way sometimes! Yes, I understand she's in a bad place right now...and embarrased and feeling like a failure...but you don't tell someone you're moving in with them, have them completely rearrange their life and their house for you to just not show up or call or have someone ELSE call for you.  I would've understood if she had called two days before, the day before or even the DAY she was supposed to move in and say "You know what, I think it's best that I just move home...I'm sorry it didn't work out, but thanks for the offer..."  but nooooooooooo...not a WORD!!!  I wouldn't have been mad at her...I would've understood and I would've been able to help her through her problems...or atleast be there for her as a best friend...  I'm just glad she's ok.  I was worried...half of me knew she was in Washington and the other half of me thought her useless pile of ex boyfriend had done something to her.  I hope she calls me.  I want to be there for her while she gets better...but I think she also needs to know what I've gone through since 9/8/02 when she disappeared off the face of the earth...I won't yell or lose my temper...but I think I have a right to explain to her why she can't just do that to someone...right?  Am I right? Am I wrong?  Any advice would be great.   Thanks.

       another lazy day   OK So I don't think we'll be doing anything today...at all...and to me, that sucks.  I realize that we need time to relax...but I thought that's what we did yesterday?  *sigh*   Lastnight was fun though.  We went to a friends house for dinner.  They have 3 boys, one is only about a year older than Hannah and they were playing in the living room and all of a sudden he smacks her with the remote!  She was ok of course...nothing serioius...but she was tired and I think even a bit shy around them since she didn't know them...and of course not expecting it...so she freeeeeeeeaked out *frown* It was sad, but nothing serious...everyone has asked me "Well...aren't you mad at the little boy for hitting her?"  Umm...no...first of all, he's not even two yet...and second...he's got two big brothers that beat up on eachother all the time! It's the nature of little boys to play rough and he is probably used to seeing his brothers laugh at stuff like that and wanted to make Hannah laugh *smile*  and it's not like he broke anything...she's fine...so I'm not mad and it won't stop me from letting her play with him again!    Anyway--it's noon...and Deane and Hannah are both napping.  SO I'm bored...as usual.  Wishing I had something to do.  But I don't.  So here I sit.  Bored bored bored.  I was going to try and figure out how to put blinkies on my page since I saved a bunch from Jennie's  urlLink Page  yesterday and from some other sites as well...I just dont' feel like doing it though.  I did open an account with  urlLink Lycos  yesterday so that I could use an FTP account for my blog...I even uploaded the images....I just need to post them in here now *smile*  That should take me another two months...laaaaaaazy!!!  I showed someone my webpage lastnight at dinner because she wanted to see baby pictures of Hannah...and when I loaded the page I realized that I hadn't updated my page since July!  I felt like such a loser!  It didn't matter to her because the pictures were still great, but I felt bad for neglecting my page that I've worked my rear-end off on for the last five years...*sigh*  YES I've had a page that long...NO it hasn't always been with geocities...but I've had one for as long I can remember.    *sigh*  Time to go shower and make the best of yet another boring day.

        HAPPY WEEKEND!!!    I was going to upload some pictures this morning, since a  urlLink friend   of mine told me where to go to upload them so I can use them in my blog *smile* (Thanks Juls!)  Anyway, time, as usual, got away from me and I didn't have time to do it, and now I have to get ready to go to a friends house for dinner...*sigh*   It's ok though, I'm kind of growing tired of upkeeping my webpage with cute graphics and flashy stuff...so maybe I'll just keep this low key...although I did find some reeeeeeeeeally cute blinkies on Jennie's site and at another blinkie depot place...but we'll see.    Yesterday's Friday Five sort of disappointed me...previous ones have been really good, but this set was sort of dull...we'll see how they do next week and that will decide whether I keep doing it anymore.    This morning I was up at 4:30 a.m...and at 7 a.m. decided that since I was awake and not doing anything, and Hannah was finally sleeping, I would go to the DMV and get my CAL State ID card...so I did.  Everyone at work that knew I was going today was like "OOOOH You'll have to wait in line for HOURS! Everyone goes on Saturday!"  I was in and out of there in like an hour...the whole trip took less than two hours and I had to take the bus.  While I was there I grabbed the CAL State drivers handbook as well...I figure I should learn to drive someday soon, since I'm almost 23 and all...LOL...  Tonight we're having dinner with one of Deane's co-workers and his family.  I don't know for sure where they live, but I'm looking forward to seeing them!  They have a little boy that's almost 2...so him and Hannah should get along...She's still fighting off a cold though so I don't know how sociable she'll be tonight...especially with boys *smile*    OOOH I just checked out Christina's  urlLink Recipe  page...(sorry that it took me so long LOL)  she has some good ones on there that I think sound good!!!   OH MAN...Hannah picked up "Spinning" at daycare...she stands in the middle of the floor (Or dangerously close to a table) and spins herself around until she topples over.  It's hilarious...Deane also taught her to shake her head from side to side really fast...so she does that a lot too...it's so fun to watch her mind grow everyday! She learns all kinds of new things and it's fun watching her experiment!!!  Anyway, I have to get her dressed and all prettified for her night out *smile*

        the friday five    1. Would you say that you're good at keeping in touch with people?   So so...I keep in touch with the people that are most important to me...close friends and family.  For the other people in my life, I keep in touch with them when I can...when I have a free minute or something.  They all understand my priorities though and none of them get toooo cranky when I don't write them.  Besides, by now they all know I have a blog and can read up on me here.   2. Which communication method do you usually prefer/use: e-mail, telephone, snail mail, blog comments, or meeting in person? Why?   Hmmmmmm...I would have to say e-mail or blog comments...why? Because that way I'm in control of the conversation.  If I run out of things to say in an email or a blog, I can just end it and send it...if I'm on the phone or in person, I have to sit there and wait for the other person to finish and get bored before I can get out of the conversation.  As for snail mail...I like doing that too, but only if I can type out my letter...I haven't hand written a whole lot since HS, so my hands cramp up a lot if I have to write too much...I prefer typing.   3. Do you have an instant messenger program? How many? Why/why not? How often do you use it?   OHHHH YES, I have just about every kind.  I have AOL IM, YAHOO Messenger, MSN Messenger and ICQ...plus my tagboard on my blog and the comment system.  I don't know if the last two count, but I think they would qualify.  I have so many different chat programs because I like to keep in touch with family and friends.  My newest chat program is YAHOO, I got that because my family sent me a webcam and they used YAHOO for their webcams and so I installed it as well so we can chat like that.  Deane got me hooked on AOL IM...and as for ICQ...I never use it, but I have it and it's a special program for me, seeing as how I met Deane through ICQ...I'm not sure why we have MSN...probably because we both have Hotmail accounts or something...but I can't remember why we installed it.    4. Do most of your close friends live nearby or far away?   Most of them live far away...although Deane is one of my best friends :-) I'm not originally from Southern California, so my friends are mostly back in my home state of Washington...I miss them *frown*  Although I am making some new friends at my new job, I doubt any of them will ever take the place of my dear friends back home.    5. Are you an "out of sight, out of mind" person, or do you believe that "distance makes the heart grow fonder"?   I believe in "distance makes the heart grow fonder" ... I'm a true believer in "You won't miss it til it's gone"...I think I took my friends and family for granted ... until I moved away from their support and love...and now that I'm away from them, I miss them more than I ever did when I lived there...plus I really think about them a lot and appreciate the times that we did have together...no matter what was going on...atleast I had friends I could count on and the support of a great family.

        it's ALIIIIIIVE!!!   Yay! I'm so glad my blog loaded tonight!!!  Today was an interesting day...for the last hour and a half of my day, I work all by myself and one of few people left in our building...which is normally great because with no distractions, I fly through my work and get a lot done...but today right at 4, when the other lady leaves for the day, I finished with my last project and had nothing to do but twiddle my thumbs until 5:30! It sort of was boring, until one of my coworkers came out to decorate the other half of my desk for Moe's birthday tomorrow.  I don't know what sort of importance that is, but it was entertaining :-)  I got an email from a girl I used to live next door to.  It made me feel old to read that she'd be moving into her college dorm tomorrow...I used to babysit this girl...ugh.  THEN I found out her little sister is in HIGH SCHOOL...*sigh* I never thought they'd grow up...and they have.  I feel 80.  Plus I started feeling bad for not keeping up with what's happening in my hometown.  I'm sure nothing interesting is going on, seeing as how it was a hole in hell when I lived there, and I didn't see it improving on the few visits I made there after I left.  I think about it a lot though, I think about High School a lot...I don't know why, it's not like I would ever want to go back, or that I ever think "gosh, I had it so much better in high school..." because I didn't.  I'm much happier where I'm at today...I guess maybe I'm just curious what all my old class mates are doing...maybe. I know that most of the girls I went to school with and HATED are probably all still fast, cheap and easy...*smirk*  Gosh I didn't like those girls at all...lol.  I had two real *enemies* in HS...they never actually did anything to me, and if I was a nicer person, I'd probably forgive and forget, but I just really didn't like them and still get really upset when I think about them...one of them swore me to secrecy when I found out she lived on a farm *GASP* NOOOO NOT A FARM! HELLLLO You freakin' MORON...you're from KETTLE FALLS...in FARM COUNTRY! Half the people at our school were either farmers or cowboys...give it up.   SEE I still get upset :-)   Anyway--Hannah is wiggling around in my lap and trying to eat the monitor so I'm gonna go. SHE WONT STOP GRABBING THINGS! AAAAAAAH PUT DOWN THE DISKS!!!

        a bit homesick    I don't know what will happen, if for some reason my bosses don't approve my time off for Thanksgiving this year.  I reeeeeally want to go home and see my family for the long weekend.  I was really missing them tonight.  I was looking at Hannah and remembering what my neice, Heilee (pronounced Hayley), was like when she was a year old.  She is so fun and so pretty, but I can't believe she's 10 1/2 now...when she was here in July we were swimming in the pool and I tried to lift her up to throw her over my shoulder and completely forgot that she's not a 30 lb. 6 year old anymore...not that she's huge or anything...she just weighs as much as a normal 10 year old...not a 6 year old...I still see her as the little girl she was when she first came to live with us.  I miss her very much!!!  Then there's my dad...I miss him sooo much too.  I atleast got to see my mom and Heilee in July...I haven't seen dad since February...he's so very sweet and I miss him so so so much.  I wish there was a way to have the life I have right now, and have my parents and Heilee close by.  As for my mom, well...who doesn't miss their mom?  I miss her very much and I really miss it when I was unemployed and she would call me on her lunch break and we'd talk while she ate lunch or went for a walk.  As for my brother, I haven't talked to him much in the last 4 or 5 years, so I don't really know what he's up to.  I miss him too though...I know that he's happy and has a good life...but I just wish we could talk more.  Between him and my sister, I always felt closer to him than to her...probably because he didn't let me down as much (ALTHOUGH HE STILL OWES ME A CHOCOLATE MILK FROM KINDERGARTEN!!! LOL)  I'm looking forward to Thanksgiving.  I probably won't get to see my brother...he doesn't travel much for the holidays for reasons unknown to me...but that's ok...I guess I'm just not meant to spend time with him anymore.    Deane is on the phone with his friend Betsy (I think that's who called)...so I'm in here diddling around on my silly blog... urlLink Buffy  is on...I thought she was supposed to have died?  I've never seen more than 2 minutes of this show the entire time it's been on and it's sort of just on in the background because the show I was watching before this is over...but anyway...I thought she died? What happened? Is this like a Soap Opera where anything can happen?  *sigh*  I'm sure my friend Myra's head is spinning right now because Sarah Michelle Gellar finally married Freddie...Myra sort of had a thing for him and when I broke the news to her that they were engaged, she called me all sorts of names and damned me to Hell...LOL....so I'm very sorry Myra that he's married...if you makes you feel better, I found out that she got Montezuma's Revenge at the wedding in Mexico...heh heh heh...

        more movie watching...   Hannah is trying to sweep our floor with the biggest broom in the world...or atleast to her it's the biggest broom in the world...She keeps bonking herself in the head with it.  She has this box of "Gerber Graduate" Animal Crackers and she loves loves loves them...well I guess I didn't give her enough earlier, because somehow she got the box off the coffee table and when I walked out there she had crackers all over the floor and crumbs dripping off her chin...she was holding the empty box shaking it and looking at me like "See Mommy! I wanted more!!!" UGH! hehehehehe...it was cute.  I've been cleaning the messy apartment all afternoon.  I got our bedroom done and am working the living room and doing laundry (sorry Deane, but I'm even washing your clothes even though you don't like me to...there's just SOOO many though!)   Right now I'm watching  urlLink Someone Like You  with Ashleigh Judd, Hugh Jackman and Greg Kinnear.  I don't know if Deane likes this movie, but I really do.  I've seen it a hundred times...but there's never anything good on in the afternoon.    Time to finish cleaning.

        movies...   I'm having a lazy-day.  *sigh*  I was all gung-ho about going out with Hannah and getting my shiny new Cal. State Id card, and realized...waaaait! I don't have a stroller! The two strollers we do have are in the trunk of our car...which is in Glendale with Deane today *sigh*.  So then I called Deane's brother and they offered to let me use one of their strollers...so I said OK! Good idea.  Then I changed my mind like an hour later and decided to just let Hannah stay home and rest today and hopefully *fingers crossed* feel better.  So I watched  urlLink American Pie 2  ... yes Deane...I WATCHED IT AGAIN TODAY... heh heh heh...Now we're going to watch  urlLink Regarding Henry .  I've always only seen from the middle of this movie to the end...I've never seen the beginning.  Besides, he has a cute puppy named Buddy!!!    Speaking of puppies (and beagles...which Buddy is)...I found the neateest website today.   urlLink  Beagles On The Web  is all about being a foster-owner to a beagle!  We've decided that when we get a dog, it'll be a beagle!  I would like to adopt a puppy...if we were ever to get all the different kinds of dogs that we want though, we'd be "those" people...the kind of people you see on TV that have a million dogs on this big muddy farm where we go "glushing" around in mud feeding them every morning.  Nevermind...that doesn't make any sense.  I just want a puppy...

        hannah's sickie poo *frown*    Good morning!  Here's an interesting quiz...and a bizarre look into my life...   urlLink       I feel so bad for the little monkey!  She's snifflie and conjested and unless I wipe her nose and use that little nose suckler thing to suck the gross stuff out constantly, she has a hard time breathing out her nose.  I can't use the nose suckler thing all the time though, it's like convincing an elephant that he needs to wear tennis shoes!  The amazing thing is that this cold isn't slowing her down one bit! She's not fazed by it one bit...she's ripping apart my catalog even as we speak!  It's so funny.  I'm glad it's not making her too grumpy...the teething already takes care of that for us!  Oh my God...she's climbing on our file box. OK whew...she's crazy I tell ya.    This is the first day I've missed from work since I started.  I was a bit nervous calling in, but luckily my bosses are both female and most of the people I work with are as well...so they're a bit more compassionate about sick babies then men would be...atleast I think so anyway.  Deane was home with her yesterday though, and he's been so good about staying home with her since I started work, but he's missed a few days and we don't want him in trouble do we? So I stayed with her today and everyone at work seems to be nice about it...*sigh of relief*  I'm always afraid that when I call in sick someone will call me back and say "Sorry...tough luck...you're   FIRED! " lol.  I'm such a paranoid freak aren't I???

        mmm....sleeeep...   Wow, ok...so we just all took a 3 1/2 hour nap! It felt sooooooo gooood to sleep!!!  Hannah woke up grumpy and upset though, she needed a new diaper and a fresh bottle and she went right back to sleep.  I think she's getting her two upper teeth and on top of that she still has the snifflies!!!  So hopefully in a few weeks she'll have two shiny new teeth to bite us with!!!   We haven't eaten dinner, and I'm ok with that for some reason...it seems like whenever I'm tired, or have taken a long nap, I don't eat when I wake up, and then it's so late that it's practically time to go back to bed, so then I don't eat at all, and wake up in the morning starving...and since I only eat lunch and dinner, I suffer until 1p.m. when I finally get lunch! It's such a twisted world I live in :-)   On our last trip to Costco, I discovered they don't sell cases of orange soda...weird eh?  They do sell "party packs" of soda that have a variety of different sodas, like cherry soda, root beer, orange soda and lime soda...so we got that...now, I've never been a huge root beer fan...but that's what I've been drinking the most of lately...weird huh?  It's like a new taste to me almost and it's sooo addicting.  *shaking my head*   Anyway--time to roll!

        married...but lonely...email I got   OK if you're married and having problems...I understand you need someone to talk to, as I know several people in real life as well as a couple online that are having marital problems...however, the following email arrived in my inbox today and while I normally just delete the spam mails I get, this one struck me as funny and sad all at the same time...   marriedbutalwayslonely has arrived!  How have you been? You would not believe what I found but it is true. There is a site for people to talk, chat, see each others pictures, and even meet each other as close as next door that I found.But that's not the best part, here is why it's so unbelievable, not all the people are single, in fact, a lot of them are even married, looking to satisfy their hungriest desires. marriedbutalwayslonely has arrived! You would not believe what is going on and what people are saying about this site, check this out!   I'm sure I'm not the only that's gotten this email...as it's a spam email and probably reaches thousands of people everyday.  I'm just wondering what kind of people would actually do something like this.  I mean...I've never been able to understand why anyone would want to be in more than one relationship at a time...why not, if you're unhappy enough to start "wandering" not just get out of the unhappy one, whether you're married or not...and move on to someone that makes you happy?  Maybe because I've never really experienced anything like that for myself...where I've been in an unhappy relationship and thought about cheating...or maybe it's because I just can't picture anyone ever actually going through the cheating process...it doesn't seem worth it to me in the end, because it always ends badly and always more than one person, more than likely yourself included, gets hurt.  *sigh*  I feel sorry for the people that are like this...that look at life and decide that infidelity and lying is a safe healthy route.  Kudos, however, go out to those that have learned their lessons and have picked a better road to go down...as I know some guys that have made a full turn around and realized they were total idiots to do something that crazy.    Am I making any sense? Does anyone agree? Disagree?  I have extremely strong feelings about infidelity...and lying especially.  I'm a strong believer in this:   "If you tell me the truth right now, I can't guarantee that I wont' be upset...but atleast I won't be as upset with you as I would be if you lied to me about it and I found out the truth later."  Does that sound right?  I think so.  I mean, we can't guarantee that we won't be mad, or hurt...but isn't it always better to be honest? I'm sure that email got wasn't implying that we should "cheat" on our spouses and loved ones...but it sure wasn't sending us the "don't cheat" message either...was it?  As with all spam I get, I did delete it, but I thought I would post it here to help make some sort of point about how I feel about this subject.  Hannah is throwing a royal fit though so I'm gonna go help calm her down!!!

       EARLY DAY YIPPEEEEEE!!!          urlLink what's  your  battle cry?  |   urlLink mewing.net  |  urlLink  merchandise!     I found that quiz in  urlLink Christina's  Blog.  I thought it was hilarious that her battle cry was "moo" and mine was "meep"  What animal "meeps"??? I guess maybe the road runner huh? Gosh that's even funnier, I am not a road runner...hehehehe...I dont' run anywhere.  It wouldn't be hard for the Coyote to catch me...I'm so old and slow now that a turtle could catch me.   Today was a good day.  Hannah had the snifflie's so her and Deane had a quality father/daughter/winnie the pooh day together.  And they picked me up for lunch so we went to  urlLink Quizno's  and then wandered around  urlLink Bed Bath and Beyond  until I had to go back to work.  Today was my early shift day. I worked 7:00-4:00.  It was a nice change, getting off work early and having more time with Deane and the baby.  I hated waking up at 4:45 a.m. though...I forgot that time even existed...good lord it was so dark outside! UGH!  Plus I missed my bus, so I had to run down my street about a half mile to try and cut it off when it turned to head East toward my  urlLink job .  When I got there, I was the ONLY ONE THERE, so I had to walk around back through the big scary ware house in the almost dark.  I walked through there like a sniper would...to make it that much scarier (for someone already scared of the dark), a computer was beeping and I thought it was a man eating robot LOL...ok that was a bit of an over-excited imagination...but still...it was scary!     I don't know if I already said this or not, but two weeks ago I opened a new bank account  and they took my picture for my check card...well, Deane upgraded his check card on the same day to a photo ID.  And I guess because we have the same address and our pictures were taken together, they mixed up our pictures, so when I got my card, it had my name on it and my signature, but his picture...it was soooo funny.  So we had to go in and get our pictures taken again.  Deane is convinced I'm trying to turn him into a woman, since I'm always making him hold my purse for me, and the baby, and push the stroller...and now he thinks I had them put his picture on my card on purpose *smile* too cute.    Anyway, my hand is cramping up, so I'll finish for now.  I'm sure to have more later though, as this blog is the only way I'm really communicating with anyone right now!

       SOOOO MUCH FOOOOOOD...   ugh...stop the insanity!!!  I hardly ate any dinner lastnight *but atleast now we know why Carl's Jr. calls it the "Super Value Combo" ... it's perfect for someone with no cash and a teeeeny tiiiiiiny almost non-existent stomach! Yikes!  But today...man oh man...it seems like all I've done is eat eat eat.  Which isn't healthy for anyone, but when you think about what I've eaten, it's a heart attack waiting to happen!!!     Have you ever thought about stuff like what would the world be like if dogs were called cats and cats were called dogs? What if black was white and red was blue?  Would we really be that much different? I dont' think so.  I think about this a lot...I'm a bit strange actually.    Does anyone like sports?  I LOOVE baseball...I work with a bunch of hockey fanatics (sorry fellow coworkers...in case they read this) but I do not like Hockey...I do not like it at all...I like it as much as Sam I Am likes Green Eggs and Ham...he does not!  But all day I listen to them talk about it and how their very goal in life (or atleast this hockey season) is to turn me into a Rangers fan "RANGERS BABY...YEAH!!!" lol...yeah, right.    Yesterday I watched my first soccer game...live.  Deane's neice plays soccer, so we went over to the field to watch her game.  She's 9 and this is like her fourth or fifth year in soccer...if only I was that athletic when I was her age, maybe I wouldn't be twins with a blimp hangar right now.  Her team lost, but not because she didn't try!  It was fun watching them all competitive and stuff.  There was a pair of twins on her team that I would be afraid to play against!!! I hope we get to watch her play again, it was so much fun!    I'm having second thoughts about my schedule tomorrow.  I really don't want to go into work an hour and a half early...the positive side of that is I get off an hour and a half early...but I have to get up sooooo early...ugh.  I'm such a whiner sometimes huh?    I told you...mindless ramblings...

       better day   Today was better.  Thank God.  We lounged around the apartment all day and had a good talk this morning.  Hannah actually wasn't too much of a terror...she had a few teething episodes that almost sent me through the roof, but nothing to bad :-)  Tomorrow I go into work an hour and a half early! Yikes...I hope I can wake up in time.    I'm watching  urlLink "Indian Summer"   for the second time today!  Deane is making enchiladas for dinner and Hannah is napping.  I tried to wake her up but she was pretty non-responsive!!!  I dont' really have a lot to say right now...it's sort of been a s l o w news days here at our household!!! I just wanted to write something down.  I wish we had been able to go do something, but I think this was actually better for us, to just stay home and relax and spend time together.  I feel closer to him now than I have in a week...so I feel better.  We just need to find a way to spend more time together.  Some coworkers have offered their babysitting services to us if we ever need one, so hopefully we'll be able to take advantage of that when we need to get away alone once in awhile.  I miss him.

       just another entry!   OK So I may or not be done posting.  I'm going to *TRY* and go to sleep now...if my conscience will allow such an absurd idea.  This blog deal is getting more and more depressing as time goes on (and I've only had the crazy thing for what...an hour?) *sigh*    Tonight I watched two TV Show reunions...both shows are shows I watched growing up, so it's not like I watched their reunions for nothing.  The first one was the  urlLink Growing Pains Reunion ...I mean come on...who didn't watch that show as a kid?  And the other one was the  urlLink Facts of Life Reunion ...I LOOOOVED that show when I was little...probably only because Natalies RL name is Mindy...and that is my sister's name as well...I thought they were the only two on the planet named Mindy!  They were both cute movies though and it made me feel 7 years old again...and that helped me relax a bit and not be so uptight about stuff that's going on.  I'm sure Deane was thinking "Why is she watching this stuff?"  But oh well...kids will be kids.

       second entry   OK SO I think I MAY have figured this stupid blog crap out.  It took me foooooorever though and my brain is definetly releasing a huge sigh of relief now.  *whew*  I still don't know quite all the ins and outs of this, but I'm sure with a few more brain farts, I'll generate something cool out of it.    It's now 2:00 a.m. (Like anyone actually cares)...and I'm still not feeling human and I'm still not feeling better.  Hopefully this blog gets more cheerful...or else I'll just depress myself right into hermitdom...*sigh*  OK I'm gonna see if I can get this darn friggin thing to work.

        first entry   Alright, so tonight is my first entry.  It's 1:30 a.m. and I'm wide awake.  Don't know why. Just full of frustration.  Frustration with what you ask? Life.  Work.  Love.  Friends.  Money.  I'm happy with life, but if only I were a wizard that could change little odd ball frustrations with the drop of my wand or something.   For example, if I had it to do over again, I wouldn't have let myself get so excited about my friend moving in with us.  Because she never showed up.  And I'm stuck worrying about her...and being mad at her all at the same time.   Another example...I would work up the courage to ask Deane what's bothering "us" lately.  We just seem so far apart this last week that I don't feel like we're even on the same page right now.  I haven't felt like this in years, and it used to be like this because he was hiding secrets from me...which I don't know if that's still true...I hope it's not...but if it is, I'd like to know.  But if I ask him about it, he'll get upset and accuse me of not trusting him...which I do trust him...I just need to know what's been between us.  *sigh*  What a crappy depressing way to start a blog.  UGH.

         soooooooo much suuuuuuuuuuugar    UGH NO MORE CANDY PUHLEEEASE!!! I've been eating candy since 8 a.m.   If I don't stop now I'll turn into a mound of sugar and melt away into ... some... gross...sugar river or something.  I gave the last of my candy to Deane when I got home tonight and he said "Oh, that reminds me...here" and hands me a handful of twizzlers...my favorite *frown*  SO I HAD TO EAT THEM!  *groan*  On an EVEN sadder note...if that's possible...we can't take Hannah out tonight *frown frown*  She's got some sort of rash all over the front of her body and around her neck.  Her back is ok...but it looks like she fell headfirst into something that she's allergic to...so we aren't going to go out after all.  *frown*  Hannah is in the bath being a grumpus.  Oh well!  We've only had a few trick or treaters tonight...a scary demon kid and a skeleton...we have a TOOON of candy though so I handed each of them like 5 pieces and they both looked at me with huge eyes like "WOOOOOW, sooo much candy!!!" hehehehehe it was great.  I have a friend at work who said today that she's lived in her house for twenty-five years and adults that went to her house as kids, are now bringing their kids to her house because she gives out really good treats every year and they remember her.  I want that.  I really do.  I want to live somewhere where I'm that appreciated.    Anyway--I'm off to figure out what's wrong with Hannah.

        two weather pixies?   That's not right!  For some reason when I came to my blog tonight, two weather pixies were showing up! Weird eh? I checked my html and it was only showing one...hmmm *scratching head in confusion*  Anyway--  I noticed that I haven't been posting as much here!  Probably has a lot to do with the boring life I tend to lead.  Plus, the last couple of nights, Deane has been on here a lot (A lot more than he thinks...) so that's sort of taken away from time I would spend in here just wanting to check my email.  Lastnight I came in to check my mail and was in here about 5 minutes and went to help him tuck Hannah in and by the time I came back in here...about 10 minutes later...he was already online...so I just ignored it and went out to watch TV.    Tonight I saw  urlLink Poltergeist  for the first time...I've also seen  urlLink The Shining  recently for the first time...two movies that I've always heard about how scaaaaaaaaary they are...I'm sorry...did I miss something?  Not really all that scary...just extremely creepy...along with  urlLink  The Exorcist .  None of them were "scary-frightening"...just creeped me out totally.    On a less sickening note...my fingers have really been swollen today! I haven't been able to wear my engagement ring and my watch is tighter than usual!  Usually, if I'm bloated or something, my ankles will swell up too, but not today...just my hands and wrists...kind of strange.  They haven't been this swollen since I was pregnant...and NO I am not...thanks for asking though.

        sleepy!!!   Lastnight I stayed up way too late watching Third Watch...Deane even went to bed before me, which NEEEEVER happens!!! I'm usually in bed asleep before 10...but lastnight I was up until 11:30.  So needless to say that this morning at work I was fairly worthless LOL...on my lunch though I managed to sleep for about 30 minutes...and that totally refreshed me.  I have a new toy at work! It's sooo cool.   Part of my 'job' is to fold hundreds of invoices everyday and mail them out.  Well it takes FOOOOREVER!  And today when I got back from lunch,  urlLink Pitney Bowes  was there with a  urlLink folding machine .  It did an hour and a half of my work in about 20 minutes...so I had time to get all caught up on my other stuff...so that improved my day A TON!  I felt muuuuch better after that was taken care of.  Anyway--I can only imagine what people are thinking "Good Golly, is all she has to talk about a  folding machine??? "   UGH! It seems that I have no time these days :-(  Not for anything.  Halloween is on Thursday...anyone going to dress up?  Not me!  We're having a big to-do at work over it, with a luncheon and a costume party and stuff...I'll probably go to the lunch to socialize, but I'm not going to dress up.  The last time I dressed for Halloween was 5 years ago when my darling friends dressed me up as the Grim Reaper...it was a cheesy costume, but a definete fun party *smile*    I started a  urlLink yahoo! group  last weekend and haven't had any time to play with it or really promote it.  Everything has just been so hectic around here it seems.  Sunday night we were at Disneyland and we ended up staying late to see the end of the world series! The Anaheim Angels won, and Edison Field...where they won, was only like 2 or 3 miles from Disneyland...there were hundreds of people sitting outside Disneyland watching it on a huge jumbo-tron and when they won the entire crowd erupted and started cheering.  It was really fun and probably the neatest thing I've been a part of.  What was even cooler was when we were leaving the park, we could look over and see Edison Field still all lit up...it was just a cool feeling being so close to such an awesome event.    Anyway--Hannah is almost done with her bath, so I need to go get her bed-time stuff ready.  She's still taking the amoxycillan for her ear infection, she really likes the pink bubble gum flavor, so that's an easy task at night!  She takes it right out of the little medicine dropper with no fuss.

        my latest attempt at something fun   OK...so I'm in a number of yahoo groups...and none of them are blog related, but since blogs are the newest thing on the internet pretty much, everyone has been posting in groups asking advice and questions and talking about blogs and it's irritating some of the other members...who want to keep it topic related or whatever.  SO I thought...why not make a group just for bloggers???  So here it is...     urlLink     Click to subscribe to bloggersanonymous      Come join me! I'm the only member so far and it's sad and lonely in there!

        I'm spending WAAAY too much time online tonight!   OK tonight I changed my email address!!! Click on "contact" to send me an email at my new address if you'd like.  Other than that not much going on! OOOH I did get to chat with my friends mom tonight!   I know...sounds weird huh? But this woman was like another mom to me when I was in Junior High/High School...her daughter and I and Jean were best friends and got into a little bit of mischief together.   Judy is great though and I haven't talked to her in almost 4 years...so it was nice chatting with her!!!  Now if I could only be online at the same time as Rashaun!!!   We watched Game Six tonight!  I wasn't really wanting to watch it, but then it got really exciting with the  urlLink Angels  rallying back from a 5-0 score.  Way to go!  As long as Barry Bonds doesn't get his ring, I don't care who wins LOL.    Anyway--I'm off to spend time with Deane now that Hannah is in bed!  We are going to be at  urlLink Disneyland  all day tomorrow.   Have a great day tomorrow y'all!!!

        soooooo overworked!   Just kidding...I'm probably the least worked person in the world.   Today we were in the  urlLink "Valley"  (Like...DUH) and as we're driving down a street heavily laden with construction...so much so...that the usually 3 lane street is down to one...anyway, we're driving down it and all of a sudden we hear a HOOONK and we look behind us and a saturn station wagon (brand new of course...I mean...why do this in an OLD car?) is trying to sneak between the construction line and a brand new Toyota Rav 4...the Rav honks at it and as the saturn pulls up next to us we see that the passenger side mirror is hanging off and as Deane is saying "Gosh, I wonder how THAT happened?"  (Not knowing it had just happened...) the driver gets out of the saturn (leaving it in constructions way of course)...and starts talking to the Rav 4 about the huge scratch she just put in the door of the Rav...DUUUUUUUUH...anyone ever here the  urlLink Bill Engvall  comedy "Here's Your Sign"...yeah that lady definetly needed a sign.  I wanted to lean out the window and say "HEY DUMB-ASS--if you need an eyewitness account of what a MORON you are...let me know!"  but I kept my mouth shut.    Is life going by quickly for anyone besides me? It seems like yesterday I was doing the Friday Five...and here it is...another Friday gone by (I'm not doing the Five this week...just too tired :-)  It just seems like everything is going by so fast and I have no idea why.  Halloween is less than a week away!  It feels like we just moved here, and it's been over a year already.  Last time I lived here in LA, seemed like a flickin' eternity!  It must be that I'm just muuuuuuuch happier this time and not as homesick or paranoid.  *sigh*  I just wish it was the opposite...when you're unhappy life should fly by and when you're happy it shoudl go slower so you can enjoy it more...right?    Deane took Hannah for a walk.  He's never done that.  This time he has motivation though.  One of his friends from High School has a sister moving into our complex today and she's over there helping her sister...we saw them at  urlLink  Costco  this afternoon...so he's over looking for them...it's so nice and quiet here!  No TV on...no baby running around like a little tornado...none of that!  And I'm on the computer...*sigh*  Oh well.  Better than nothing.  I should be cleaning, but I haven't been alone in a looong time, so I'm eating it up.  I'll clean when they get back.    We had soooo many errands to do today!  It felt like a full day!  YAY! I love those days where you're not stressed out, but you have a full schedule.  When you're done with all your errands you feel like you've just cleaned off your dining room table!!!  I feel like we accomplished everything we needed to do with time to spare!  We ate at  urlLink Tommy's  today too...mmmmmmm it was yummy.  Way too much food though.    Deane and the monkey-toes are back!!!  They found his friend Victoria!  Her sister is moving into an apartment not far from us! (Our complex is huuuuuuge.)    Anyway--time to get going.  I'm sooooo thirsty!!!    I found some cool blinkie sites this morning.   I don't know how to link them to my blog though, so I have like 20 blinkies in a folder on my computer, and as soon as I find a site that will let me host them there and link to them here, I'll set my site up with some.  Although, I know I said I wasn't going to do that to my blog...but I don't want to do it to my website either...blinkies just seem like they belong in blogs anyway.  We'll see.  I even have some borrowed blinkies from  urlLink Jennie's  blog, but just don't have the time, the patience or the know-how to put them up here!    Have a funny sunny Sunday!

       doctors, pedialyte and expensive baby medicine...welcome to my world...   I remember one time when I was in HS and I was chatting with a guy that lived in Canada,  I was on this eating trip where all I wanted to eat was  urlLink "Munch'ems"   So when I went to send him an email and had no idea what to "subject" the email, I used the word Munch'ems...he loved it and told me what a cool idea it was to just use random words for subjects in emails...and yes...I AM A MUNCH MASTER!!! :-)  Anyway--I don't know what made me think of that...I think about it everytime I send an email though and I always laugh...*shrug*  Today we took Hannah to the doctors!!! Yesterday we were informed by her babysitter that we needed to bring her medicine with her to daycare or she wouldn't be allowed in.  So we took her in today and told the doctor that the babysitter thought it was pink-eye and all that...but that we didn't really believe her because her eye wasn't PINK...duh babysitter.  Anyway...it turned out that Hannah just has an  urlLink ear infection .  Most babies have a really hard time dealing with an ear infection, but Hannah hasn't cried or thrown too many fits or been unable to sleep because of it...so an ear infection was the least of what we thought was wrong.  We have some antibiotics for her now though and we spent a tooooon of money on pedialyte, pediacare and vicks vapor stuff for her humidifier.  I felt like such a parent tonight standing in the medicine aisle at  urlLink Albertson's  buying cold stuff for her...I could hear other parents there with their coughy sneezy little kids and I felt like I really could relate to them LOL...it's a weird feeling being a parent.  I'm glad it wasn't pink-eye though...I sort of knew it wasn't...but wasn't sure since I've never seen it before...and who I am really to argue with a babysitter who's been watching kids for 22 years? She's supposedly an expert right? Apparently not. *sigh*   I saw my boss in Albertson's tonight.  I didnt' go to work today, but when she saw me she immediately asked about Hannah and how she was doing, so I know I won't be in any sort of trouble for staying home...after all...we thought it was pink-eye...ihck right?  That's why I'm glad I have a female boss...no offense to the guys that might read this...but women are always more understanding about sick children than men are...even when the men have their own children...so I'm thankful I have a boss who's been through it twice with her own boys...she also said that everyone missed me today, so that made me feel good *smile*   Anyway--tonight I'm making a chicken pasta with french fries.  So I better get going...it's 8 p.m. here!

       no subject really    I tried posting yesterday but our internet was all funky and wouldn't stay connected for too long, I had a long post all written and when I hit submit, the bleepin computer froze and I lost my internet connection.  I got all pissy and upset and stomped off and Deane asked if he'd like me to fix it and I told him to take the damn thing and....oh...wait...that's not what happened at all...that's what I IMAGINED happened...anyway--  I've been working on tax audit stuff at work and I swear my eyes are all buggy and warped from all the percentages and tax codes I've been entering. Yikes huh? Yeah.  Just what you want to hear about...tax auditing...*sigh*  Tonight I'm making spaghetti for dinner. yum!  Lastnight I made yummy yummy chicken marsala...not the sweet kind either, this stuff tasted sort of salty and was mmmmmmdelicious!  BUT if you want really good Chicken Marsala or really good anything...try either  urlLink OSF (The Old Spaghetti Factory)  or  urlLink The Cheesecake Factory .  OK I'm talking about food...AND TAX AUDITS...ugh.  This rates as the most boring blog  EVER!    Hannah may or may not have  urlLink Conjunctivitis (Pink Eye) .  I've been researching it.  Her eyes just have a green goonky build-up in them...no pinkness or swollenness   Anyway--off to make dinner!  Have fun reading the boringest boring blog  EVER!

       a halloweenie party! YAY!   I am getting more excited about the party tomorrow! It promises to be fun! I want to see Hannah all dressed in her little Winnie The Pooh outfit!    Tonight we were going to go over to the Commons in Calabasas to hang out and go to the book store and stuff...but one thing led to another, and I think Deane may have gotten caught up on the computer a little bit *too* long, so we just didn't go.  Kind of a let-down...but such is life these days...letting me down.  Oh, well.  Brighter days ahead? Possibly!  UGH For some reason Diet 7-UP is TOTALLY giving me the hiccups tonight!  I tried sipping it slowly and I still *H*I*C*C*U*P* everytime I take a drink. *sigh*   I don't have much to say...my life is pretty un-eventful...OK IT'S BORING...I'll just come out and say it...MY LIFE IS BORING OK? Get over it...I have.  *smile*   Time to go.  Deane is in the living room singing...THE MADNESS I TELL YOU!

       the friday five    1. How many TVs do you have in your home?   We have two TVs'...one in the living room and one in the bedroom.   2. On average, how much TV do you watch in a week?   Probably too much TV...the 3 or 4 hours that I'm at home and awake I probably spend most of it with the TV on...whether I'm paying attention to what is on or not is something totally different.     3. Do you feel that television is bad for young children?   Only if it's the wrong kind of TV...Like I wouldn't let Hannah watch TV shows like Friends, or Simpsons, or Will and Grace or some of the other shows I watch...too grown up.  She can watch some shows on the discovery channel...and disney movies.     4. What TV shows do you absolutely HAVE to watch, and if you miss them, you're heartbroken?   Hmmm...I just talked about this lastnight...but OK.  I normally HAVE to watch TV on Thursdays...that's when Friends, Scrubs, CSI and Without a Trace are on.  Once in awhile I'll watch 3rd Watch, Will and Grace and ER...and occasionally Crossing Jordan...but those aren't "must haves."  5. If you had the power to create your own television network, what would your line-up look like?  Hmmm...Ive never really thought of it.  I guess I'd have to say that I'd pick comedies and more movies that are true stories...like more movies based on books like the ones Ann Rule writes...  Here's a question...   WHY DOES THE FRIDAY FIVE GET MORE BORING EVERY FRIDAY?

        OWWWIEEE!!!   OK so here's a smart idea--don't take a big bite of ANYTHING that just came out of the oven!  Oh MAN my tongue is sooooooo burned now!  *sigh*   Anyway--I'm sooo excited about tomorrow.  Just because it's Friday.  ugh...I need a weekend.  I picked up the costumes for Hannah today!  She gave me two of them in case one didn't fit.  One of them is an Eeyore one that has a little thing in it so when you squeeze his hand, he talks!!! It's too big though.  We made her try on the Winnie The Pooh-Bumble Bee outfit and it fits and is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo incredibly adorably cute on her!  She got mad at us because we were laughing and saying how cute she was, so she sat down and started rolling around on the floor trying to get it off...*sigh* I love babies!  LOL  Anyway--tonight was TV night here...the only shows I really are into are on Thursdays and they were all pretty good...but now I'm tired and think I"m gonna go crawl into bed after I finish making a cd on the other computer!

       *smack*   I didn't post lastnight! I blog hopped a bit and caught up on all the goings-ons in bloggie-land...but was toooo tired to write anything myself.  I was in bed BEFORE 8 p.m. and slept until my alarm went off this morning! *YAAAWN*  *STREEEEETCH*  I feel better today though and the dark droopy circles under my eyes arent' as dark and droopy today!    Someone at work, a wonderul person I should say, has agreed to let Hannah borrow a halloween costume!  AND the great news is, that it's a costume we were already considering getting for her ANYWAY...so it's not like we wanted her to be a princess and someone said "OH I've got a cute kitty outfit she can wear!"  We wanted her to be Eeyore or Winnie The Pooh and my friend has a Winnie The Pooh Bumble Bee costume that her daughter wore two years ago!  So *whew* huge sigh of relief.  I'm excited!  Anyway--it's been so dreary and foggy and overcast and yucky out...but NO RAIN YET! I'm so bummed.  I want it to pooooooour!  PLEASE LET IT RAIN!!! :-)

       mmmmm chocolatey goodness   OK so tonight was fun.  We had an unexpected invite over to dinner at Deane's family's house.  They are great wuuuunderful people!  His sis-in-law made pork chops and she cooked them "chinese" sort of...they had soy and ginger sauce over them and turned out really yummy. **SHHHH** Deane isn't a big fan of pork, but he ate it anyway because he's a good and decent man *smile*   Hannah even ate a bunch of it, and broccoli and baked potato too...I was proud of my little family!  After that we finished watching the NLCS and I almost DIED when the Giants took it...I soooo don't want Barry Bonds to get a world series ring...he's the least deserving of a WS Ring than any other player on the face of this earth!!! Oh well.   Then we saw the Seahawks give up the lead on MNF and lose to the 49er's...I feel sorry for Seattle Seahawks fan...just when they start having something to look forward to...they lose...again...lol.  J/K...I guess they aren't ALL that bad...just pretty bad...  Anyway--his sis-in-law sent us home with yummy-hot-fresh-baked-chocolate-chip-cookies...what KIIIND were they you ask???  urlLink NESTLE  of course!!!  Deane's family supports him so well!!! *smile*  For those of you that haven't figured it out...Deane works for Nestle LOL...  Lastnight we watched one of Deane's birthday presents.  His friend Joe got him the DVD collection of the  urlLink "Young Ones"   it's a british comedy and I'd only ever seen one episode, but the collection has ever "stoopid episode" on a 3 disc collection...Deane loves the show and was really excited when he opened his gift (Thanks Joe!) He also got  urlLink "UHF"  with Weird Al...and  urlLink "Airplane" .  So I'm sure our week will be full of movies!  They're all good very funny movies though!!!    Anyway--I'm off to tuck Hannah in with Deane.  Nightie's!!!

       hmph   I got tired of looking at my delipidated website...so I deleted it.  Then I put together a very simple one that won't require nearly as much work and effort.  You can check it out  urlLink here .   I just got tired of it being such a chore to update and keep maintained.  I'm putting it back the way it was five years ago when I first started it!  Just a simple site with some pictures and a little information about me and my story.  I've been dedicating a lot of time to my blog anyway...so hopefully this will be my "main" page or whatever.  We'll see!

        my mommy   I found out that my mom does in fact read my blog!  Which is good, because I feel bad for not writing her as often.  She accused me of being too busy for her...hopefully she was kidding...I think she was.   I don't have time for anything these days though.  Hannah is pretty much a monster and my job completely drains me of wanting to do anything.   I spend all day in front of a computer, typing stuff, helping customers and stuff, the last thing I feel like doing when I come home is writing some more...so that's why I keep this blog...one entry is better than writing 4 or 5 emails and this way everyone gets the same information!    She has a blog now though!  SHe started it this morning.  I made a link to it on the side with my other links.  I'm DYING to get into her HTML and make links and put up tagboard and imood and a comments section LOL...I'm sure that's all she needs...heh heh heh...  I have sort of an interesting topic of interest for my readers...  Have you ever noticed when you're on the freeway and you KNOW nobody is doing the speed limit (which here it's 65 on most freeways)...and a cop pulls someone over out of the crowd of 10 cars all doing 90?  How do you think he decides which one to pull over?  We know he can't pull EVERYONE over...but how does he pick that ONE car?  That always puzzles me when we're on the freeway and I see someone pulled over on the side of the road and I wonder "Hmmm...what did he do to get picked out of the crowd of speed-limit violators?"  Interesting huh? Yeah, I think it is.  I can't think of anybody that I know who actually obeys the speed limits on a freeway...*puzzled look*   I think I'll go ponder this some more.

        friday five on saturday   OK so I had this Friday Five aaaaall typed out last night and when I hit post and publish...my internet connection died...ugh.  So here it goes...AGAIN...   1. If you could only choose 1 cd to ever listen to again, what would it be?   Ooooh probably one of my Chris LeDoux cd's.   I know I don't listen to Country as much as I used to, and my music tastes have evolved quite a bit...but he's still my hero and I still love his music!!!   2. If you could only choose 2 movies to watch ever again, what would they be?   This one is easy...Dumb & Dumber and Journey of Natty Gann...   3. If you could only choose 3 books to read ever again, what would they be?   Hmmm...definetly one of Ann Rules books...which one I don't know since they're all good...and then probably Wizard of Oz...YES THE BOOK...and White Fang...all good books!   4. If you could only choose 4 things to eat or drink ever again, what would they be?   Hmmm...iced tea, fajitas, my mom's fried chicken and Chili's Chicken Ranch Sandwich (w/o the tangy sauce.)   5. If you could only choose 5 people to ever be/talk/associate/whatever with ever again, who would they be?     The person I would like to be:  Faith Hill  The person I would like to talk to:  My fiance, Deane  The person I would like to associate with:  My best friend, Jean  The person I would like to see again:  My brother  The person I wish I could spend more time with:  My neice Heilee

       mmmmmm the weekend!   I'll probably have to do the Friday Five tomorrow...but I'll check it out and see what it is and then decide if I'll do it at all.   Anyway--Tonight was Deane's surprise dinner birthday party at  urlLink Chili's.   I ended up breaking down and telling him about it this morning though, because I thought he had changed his mind about having dinner out tonight and I couldn't think of an aggressive way to make him go except for "OTHER PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED...YOU HAVE TO GO!"  hehehehehe...besides, I suck at surprises and I think he knew the whole time and was merely humoring me.  *ahem* ANYWAY--we had a great time.  It was a wide range of friends...one that he's known since Elemantary school, one that he's known since high school and one that he's been friends with since he started at Nestle 3 years ago!  But everyone got along well and had a good time...there were two little boys there both around the same age, and so it was easy to keep the conversation going because if it slowed down at all, the little boys would entertain us...as well as Hannah :-)  So if any of the people in attendance tonight happen along my lonely little blog--thank you all for coming :-)  All of you are wonderful people that we love to death...thank you for coming and sharing tonight with us (And for driving aaaaaaall the way out to Simi Valley for it!!!)   I had another surprise planned for tomorrow, but financial stuff happened and now we'll have to postpone that for a couple of weeks...but he doesn't have ANY idea what this part of his birthday surprise is...so it will actually BE a surprise...unless I spill the beans again LOL...I really am fun at Christmas time...I can't keep a secret for anything and can be bought and sold for nothing!!! hehehehehe...ask my mom...LOL  Anyway--Hannah is in bed now and has cried herself out and *knock on wood* is now asleep...so I'm gonna go to bed myself!!!  Goodnight!

       *yaaaaaaaaaawn*   OK So I should soooo be in bed right now...but for some reason...I'm just not!   This is probably the first time all week that Hannah has cried herself to sleep...which is incredibly nice.  She used to be so so good about going to bed, but this week it's almost like "Who's baby is this? Ours doesn't cry this much!"   UGH!  So we're having a nice break tonight!  I watched Friends, Scrubs, and CSI and now I'm watching Without A Trace.  Scrubs is still one of those shows that make me scratch my head.  I can't make up my mind about it.  Sometimes I think it's really funny and really good and other times I see it and think "Oh man, please...give me a break."   I watch it mostly as a space filler between Friends and CSI....and also because I'm curious about how crazy it will be!    Lastnight when I said "I'm not going to post anything about Deane's birthday because I don' t know if he reads this or not" Was actually a very good bet!  I fell asleep shortly after I wrote that and this morning he said "Hey! Lastnight I caught up on your blog! Good thing you decided to post any secret plans for this weekend!"  LOL...good timing.  He told me tonight that nobody has really done anything "special" for him on his birthday since his 21st birthday...or so he says...but  that made me feel good anyway and makes me really want to make this one special special special!!!  Any ideas?   EMAIL THEM TO ME!   Anyway--yeah, I'm feeling sleepy. So it's off to sleepy land for me!!!

         Congratulations, you're Seattle, the Emerald City.  What US city are you?  urlLink Take the quiz  by  urlLink Girlwithagun .   Contrary to popular opinion, Seattle is not as rainy as legend says. It is in fact a charmning green jewel with sparkling cerulean water and verdant hills. Its isolation has made it home to free-thinking and independent individuals. Despite being having the most millionaires per capita, it still has a small town atmosphere. A small town with lots of coffee that is. Java is an art there. Perhaps it is the coffee that has caused this city to give birth to twisted cartoonists and rock stars.    YAY!  I didn't cheat on this at all and I got Seattle! I love Seattle! I miss Seattle...I miss my family!  UGH!  I WANT TO GO HOME AND SEE MY FAMILY AND SEE SEATTLE and drink Tully's coffee and have lunch at Seattle Sourdough and walk through Pioneer Square and the Center. *SigH*   UGH...

       mmmmm Rolo's!   It's so funny how life does this...just the other day I wrote about how I wished I had learned more Spanish in school...and today I walk into the lunch room to get a soda and there are two coworkers sitting there with an "English To Spanish" book studying...it turns out they are both Spanish majors at the university...funny stuff.  They were writing a letter in Spanish...pretty funny.  I'm sure anyone who's first language is Spanish would've laughed their noses off listening to the pronunciations! *smile*   Anyway--I'm glad there are people that agree with me about the days of the week!  It's weird how stuff like that can really sort of almost mess with your head!    We're watching the ALCS...I'm actually rooting for the  urlLink Angels ...I figured that since  urlLink my team  isnt' in it at ALL this year...I should root for the next best...and since I'm IN LA and all...my best bet would be to go for the Angels!  As you can see, I don't have a whole lot to say.  Again, I'm just so tired and so exhausted that I really have a hard time focusing.  To make it a bit worse, I offered to switch schedules with Moe tomorrow because she has an appt. with her sons teacher at 8a.m...so I offered to give her my schedule (8:30-5:30) and I'd take hers (7:00-4:00)  I loooove her schedule though...getting off work at 4 is sooo sooo sooo nice!  But I have to get up at like 4:30 or 4:45 because Deane gets ready at the same time. *sigh*    I'm sure nobody cares about my schedule though *smile*     Today I picked up some discount coupons for  urlLink Knotts Berry Farm  as well as their  urlLink Knotts Scary Farm  attractions.  Hopefully we can make it this year.  I've wanted to go forEVER! (Or atleast as long as I've lived down here!) But we've either not been able to afford it or not had the time...so maybe we can get a babysitter for this year and we can go.  That would be fuuuun!  Deane's birthday is on Sunday--he'll be 3-------0......wow huh?  30...I have plans for him this weekend, but since I don't know if he reads this or not, I'm not going to make any posts about it until after it's all over.    Anyway--sounds like Hannah is done with her bath, so I'll go help Deane find clothes for her and then tuck her into bed.    Goodnighties!

        awwww...it's Wednesday!   And thank Goodness for that!  Tuesdays are my least favorite day.  Most people would say "WHAT? Why not Monday?" Ummm...well...because after awhile you just LEARN to deal with a Monday...but Tuesdays...there's no way to deal with them.  You have nothing to look forward to, because you still have 3 days left after Tuesday...and by now you're brain is already back focussed on work...whereas on Monday, you can still reminisce about the weekend a little.  Wednesdays...or Hump Day...are great though...they always fly by...and even though you're focused on work...you start thinking about the weekend, which makes Thursday go by quickly...and Fridays are pretty good too, although they tend to drag by a bit because you're right on the edge of your weekend...but BECAUSE it's the edge of your weekend, that makes up for the slow day!   Anyway--lastnight I was way too tired to write in this thing.  Hannah was too! She was in bed at 6:45!  Deane woke her up at 8 though so she could have a bath and eat something, but it never happened, she was so tired, we put her back in bed at 8:20 and she slept aaaaaaall night!   I was in bed before 9 even!  I didn't fall asleep until 10 or 10:30...but atleast I got to rest and watch a movie!    I'll write more tonight...I have to put shoes on and go to work...  Have a happy Wednesday!!!

       friday five on a monday night   OK so I'm about 3 days late...but better late than never right?   1. What size shoe do you wear?   Size 10...in a dress shoe though, I can wear anything from a size 9 to an 11...as long as it's a "wide" foot shoe.   2. How many pairs of shoes do you own?   *groan*  I always thought I didn't have a shoe fetish, but the other day I was going through my closet and found about 11 pairs of shoes...with more in the spare closet in Hannah's room.  I only have about 3 pair that I wear regularly though.   3. What type of shoe do you prefer (boots, sneakers, pumps, etc.)?   I prefer sneakers or sandals...although normally just sneakers.     4. Describe your favorite pair of shoes. Why are they your favorite?   My favorite pair of shoes has been gone for a very long time!  Ask my mom! I had a pair of low-top nike's...white and blue and purple...I wore them from 8th grade until about 3 years ago...when they finally got huge holes in the sides of them.  I STILL didn't want to throw them away, but my mom made me *smile*  They were my favorite because they just became a part of me...you know how they get soooo comfy?  They get to the point where they just fit your feet so perfectly and feel so good when you slip them on...*teary eyed* I miss those shoes!  I haven't found another pair of shoes that good since then.   5. What's the most you've spent on one pair of shoes?   Hmmmm...probably in High School when I was wearing "ropers" (cowboy boots)...they were between $60 and $80...

       blah, blah, blah   For lack of a better title, I thought "blah" worked fine!  Hope everyone had a great fantasmic weekend!  We went to a wedding on Saturday and then on Sunday drove to Disneyland, I realize we were just there a week ago, but they Holiday Haunted Mansion opened this weekend and we had to check it out!!! So we did...so be quiet and stop makin' fun of me!   Anyway, today at work I realized that I have ONE regret...not learning Spanish...isn't that weird? Yeah, I know.  I was forced to take two semesters of it in HS and don't remember a thing!  Oh, except "Mi llamo es Sarah..."  Whatever.   I think it would be fun to take a course on it and learn some basic stuff...Right?  We were in Long Beach on Saturday for the above mentioned wedding, and I looked out at the harbor and saw all the tanker ships at rest out there, and it looked like an entire navy of boats out there waiting to attack LA...luckily it's just a bunch of tanker ships...sadly though, all the longshoremen are locked out which is really going to raise prices of merchandise and other things at Holiday Shopping Time!    I've been absent in writing...why? I don't know.  I do this sometimes with journals and other writings...I get going going going on it, and then start fuzzing out on it...hopefully though, I can pick back up again and find some time every night to write here...since I know a lot of my friends are reading this now...*YIKES THE PRESSURE!*   Anyway--tonight after work, I took Hannah outside to play in the courtyard with her Fisher Price wagon and all she wanted to do was sit down in the mud. *SIGH*  in her pretty pink capri pants and her white shirt.  *double sigh* Whatta kid.  As soon as I walked in the door tonight, I took one look at her and said "GET IN THE TUB!" So I gave her a bath and cleaned her up and then took her outside to play...in the mud...luckily she stayed clean and all we had to to do was rinse off her shoes and her wagon...which I still have to do...I hope Deane doesn't let her play with it before I get the chance to clean off the mud...not like our carpet needs more stains...*sigh*    Off to clean the wagon and make dinner!  I'll try to find a picture of it online...it's the coolest little wagon EVER!!! *smile*

        things to ponder...   OK I took this from  urlLink Kamie's Blog ...who took it from  urlLink Jennie's Blog ...who took it from  urlLink Chocolate Orange .  But I figured I'd do it too, because it's interesting!!!   I am  a fun person  I think  my child is brilliant   I know  that life isn't that bad  I want  to get married on the ocean  I have  NO free time  I wish  I HAD free time  I hate  being mistreated  I miss  my family  I fear  that I will fail if I try new things  I hear  Deane singing a Sting song  I wonder  where I'll be in a year  I regret  trusting my sister when I was younger  I love  my life  I ache  after working out  I care  about homeless people...even though I pretend not to...  I always  groan when the alarm goes off  I am  a very funny person  I dance  only if Hell were to freeze over  I sing  like a dying cat  I cry  when an animal on TV dies  I do  not always act responsibly   I fight  with my own insecurities  I write  down my thoughts more now than when I was younger  I win  EVERYTHING!  I lose  track of time  I confuse  dates and times more than I admit to...  I listen  to country music still  I can  tell you what happens in almost every episode of "Friends"  I need  new shoes  I am happy  when I'm with Deane  I should  go to bed now  Goodnight!

       sooooo nice   It just feels nice to interact with other people...and I don't mean people at work, where all we talk about is..........work...I mean, I love my coworkers, love our crazy conversations and silly jokes...but going out to dinner, socializing, mingling, interacting...is just soooooo...nice...pleasant...wonderfully fuzzy!    I thought for sure we'd have a Mt. St. Hannah on our hands tonight though.  Normally she has a bath around 8 and then is in bed by 9...but tonight we didn't leave for dinner until 8...so when we were ordering our food ... Hannah was thinking ... "hmmm...I'm tired!"  But she did excellent.  I did a good job of keeping her mind off of being sleepy...I fed her all kinds of new foods, gave her apple juice, iced tea  Anyway--it's off to bed! Goodnight!

        hi diddley ho!   OK so I watch WAY to much Simpsons if I'm quoting Flanders!!!    Anyway--still no rain--frickin' frackin' confusin' weather!!!    Today was an interesting day at work...to say the least.  The lady I work with went home sick around lunch time, so when I got out of my afternoon meeting, I was by myself and as soon as I sat down, the doo-doo hit the fan-fan...ugh.  The paramedics had to come because someone in our warehouse had problems breathing or something...after they left (and raided our halloween candy LOL)...the main door to our building broke...now see...here's the thing...we all have badges that we wave in front of a little box when we want in the building, and that unlocks the door for us (security)...and when we have a visitor, they ring a "door bell" and it rings into our phone and we decide if they can come in or not (ooooh talk about POWER! RARRR!!!) well...that whole system went down this afternoon...so not only was I alone at the front desk, but I was answering the phones, and walking back and forth to the door letting in employees and customers all afternoon...I swear I lost 10 lbs. just walking back and forth.  Not to mention we had a ton of power outages today! It was such a weird wacky day...*sigh*  hopefully tomorrow will be better...  Tonight we are having dinner with one of Deane's best friends from High School.  We're both looking forward to it, not only because we haven't seen him in a loooong time, and hes' never met Hannah...but it also means we are going to either eat at Chili's, Elephant Bar, or Mimi's Cafe...three of our favorite places to go!!!  *smile*   Anyway--I'm off to finish getting purdified!!!  Ciao!

          pleeeease let it raaaain!!!   Let it pour...please God...let it rain for days and days and DAAAAAAYS!!!  It's been such wishy-washy weather here lately.  One day it'll be cloudy and windy and cold and the next it'll be sunny and windy and then sunny and warm...and then back to cloudy and windy.  It looks like the clouds want to burst, but they won't!!! PLEAAAASE RAIN!!!   Tonight I made a poster with PSP for a friend of mine at work who is a huge Oakland A's fan...it says "The Hunt For Green October" on it and it has the original A's logo on it.  The pring quality pretty much sucks, but she'll be happy with it anyway!  I'll email her the original copy just so she can see what it's "supposed" to look like.  After work today we went shopping and I got a suit! Weird huh? Yeah, I thought so.  I just needed an outfit to wear to the wedding on Saturday and I really wanted a pant suit, but I settled on a black and blue pinstripe suit with a skirt that falls down to my knees.  I really like it and I can wear other places as well...I've never bought such a businessy type outfit though, so I felt a little awkward :-) I almost got a grey pinstripe suit like the ones Kirstie Alley wore on her short lived TV Show...Veronicas Closet...I really liked it, but the jacket was a little too big and ballooned out on the sides and made me look fatter than I am...*smile*  I don't need any help looking over weight thank you very much!    OOOH I think my hunny just solved the print problem with Moe's poster...ooooh...neat-o...my new hero...  Goodnighties everyone!

        ****shiiiiiiiver****   OK...so I'm sitting here and all of a sudden I get a shiver down my spine...totally creepy.  I'm not even cold.  UGH.     Funny story--I took a nap and after I woke up, I took a shower so we could go shopping.  And earlier I baked a ton of those chocolate fudge cookies...so I get out of the shower and Deane looks over at Hannah and says "Oh my GOD look at her Sarah!"  So I look over...she's standing there with chocolate ALL OVER her face and she's got two huuuuge cookies...one in each hand of course and she's got this big chocolatey smile on her face and she holds the cookies up and starts giggling like she just got away with the world's perfect crime.  It was hilarious!!!  Too funny.  Anyway--we had a quiet day.  We went to Target tonight to get some diapers for the munchkin and ended up getting some safety items as well...cabinet locks, plug-in protectors and some other stuff too.  Earlier today we were spraying Febreze and noticed we were almost out so I said "We can get more when we go to Target"  so we get to Target (like 5 hours later) and couldn't, for the LIFE OF US, remember what the Hell we needed...all we could remember was me standing at the sink saying "That's ok, we can get more at Target"  UUUUUUGH...so about 20 minutes ago Deane walks out of the bedroom with something behind his back and says "If I tell you what we forgot at Target will you buy it?"  and I said sure so he pulls the Febreze out and I almost diiiiiiiiiiiied.   UGH.  I hate those stupid brain lapses.   No plans as of yet for tomorrow.  We did comment tonight though on how much more we've been doing stuff.  It feels good to be out and about.  Even with not so much money, we still find things to entertain us.  It's much more refreshing then just staying indoors being depressed. So we're all proud of ourselves!!!     Take care y'all!!!

        mmmmm double chocolate fudge cookies    Yes, I was right...they are as good as they sound...mmmm...I should look and see if they can be purchased online.   My supervisor's son was selling them through a school project...but they're sooo yummy I don't know if I can wait another year for more LOL.     Hannah is being soooo sweet and sooo cuddly today.  This morning I was sitting on the floor and she kept running up behind me and giving me a hug from behind...she's the greatest!    Today it's cloudy and cold out...it feels like winter...I'm so excited.  I love it!!!  Now if it would snow life would be perfect!!!  I got an email from my friend Anne this morning...her dog got ran over by a car and died :-(   When we were in High SChool she found this puppy at the pound and me and Jean went with her to pick it up...it was the smelliest dog ever because it had been homeless, but she cleaned her up and took her home and she's had her for like 4 or 5 years...it's sad :-(    Anyway--not much else to post.  Today is a lazy lazy day around here...which is actually fun.  I've been playing Play Station all morning...I haven't played any of our video games in several months and for some reason all of a sudden I suck  LOL...hehehehe   Take care! Have a happy Friday!!!

        ohhhh whatta world...whatta world...   Isn't this like the 100th time Michael Jordan is  urlLink retiring ?  Gosh, retire already...and here's an idea...once you do...DONT MAKE A COME BACK FOOOOOOOOOOUR TIMES....good lord...enough already...isn't he like 70 or something?  Maybe after you retire as much as him they give a set of steak knives or something...I should ask him.    Anywho--Thanksgiving here was good.  After we stuffed ourselves on Turkey and other yummy food things, we came home and I baked double chocolate fudge cookies...mmmmmm yes they are as good as they sound...mmmm...then our babysitter came over and we left Hannah in her care while we went to see  urlLink The Emperors Club .  Good movie.  I like movies that don't end the way all movies end...you know...I want the good guy to lose once in awhile...I want the guy to not get the girl everytime...I want the hero to die sometimes...and once in awhile, I don't want the bad guy to turn good...and this movie was it!  It was good.     Now we're home and Hannah is being her little monkey of herself.  Sooo cute.  She's got some icky bowel movements lately though...I'd share with you, but it's grossing me out to just think about it...so that's enough of that...I just said to Deane and Hannah "I can't believe you just pooped on me Hannah!" and Deane said "YEAH! That's not how a romantic night out typically ends!" Ugh...the joys of motherhood. LOL  I hope you weren't eating while reading that last paragraph...  Tomorrow we dont' have a lot of plans...which is ok...just going to relax hopefully.  On Sunday we might meet his friend at  urlLink Disneyland .  I know we just went last weekend, but that always happens to us...we go one weekend and then the next weekend someone invites us to go or something cool opens and we have to go back...good thing we have passes...  Goodnight!!!  I have nothing more to say!!!

        Happy Thanksgiving Blog World!   OK I may have a problem LOL...I realized today that I'm either good at sending emails or at posting in my blog...but for some reason I can't do both.  Tonight Deane installed  urlLink  Microsoft Office  so I'd have my beloved Microsoft Outlook and could use a pop account instead of yahoo.  So I've been playing with that tonight writing emails and setting up my calendar and stuff like that. It's the same program that I used when I worked at  urlLink Argosy Cruises  and I used it so often that I got to really really like it and after I quit working there, I couldn't get used to another program, so I just used Yahoo...but now...heh heh heh...I love him so much :-)  He slaved away all night to install it and work out all the little bugs...how wonderful.  Tomorrow we are going to his mom's for dinner.  I'm bummed I don't get to see my family, but his family is wonderful too, and I always have a good time with them, so I'm sure it'll turn out fine.  It's just hard to think that this will be my second holiday season away from my family...*sigh*  Anyway--take care bloggers and have a Happy Turkey Day tomorrow!!! WOO HOO!!! Four day weekend!!!

        you're just jealous because the voices talk to ME!    OK so I don't actually hear voices...just a funny t-shirt a friend of mine had a long time ago!  That and..."Stop pissing me off! I'm running out of places to hide the bodies!"  heh heh...  *ahem* Anywho...only a day and a half left of work this week! WOO HOOOOO!!!  I can't wait for the long weekend.  I think it bites that I'm not gonna see my family...but hey, 4 and a half days off has to be a good thing either way right?  Right.  I thought so.    Tonight at like 5:20 my boss came up and said "Do you have Sean's phone number at home?  He shipped out a $20,000 order and shipping made a mistake with the freight charges."   I said "Yes, let me get it for you out of the computer."  So I get it for her and she goes back and calls it and then comes back up and says "I don't think that was the right number, the guy yelled at me and told me I had the wrong number."  So we looked it up together and sure enough, it was the right number...so she asked me to call...why? I don't know...maybe because I talk to him more...but anywho...being the glutton for insults and offensive remarks, I called him.   This is how it went:  "Hello?" "Hello...my name is Sarah P________, and I'm looking for a co-worker of mine at Computer Parts Unlimited, his name is Sean F____, do you know how I can get ahold of him?" "OH Hi Sarah, it's me...Sean." "Great!  Donna is looking for you can you hold for a second and I'll transfer you over to her?" ***low murmur*** "Ohhhh...THAT Donna..."  We still don't know why he yelled at her and said he wasn't Sean and that she had the wrong number...but we got ahold of him.  Kind of strange *smile*    Anyway, I have been fighting off a headache aaaaaaaaaall day...and sitting in front of the computer screen probably isn't helping...than again...either was listening to Hannah's whine earlier when she didn't want to go to bed...but we fixed that and I'm sure this will fix itself as soon as I'm done with my stuff online!    We went to Disneyland yesterday.  I almost freeeeeeeaked out on some dumb...............lady.  We were trying to park our stroller so we could get in line for the Jungle Cruise...in order to get to the stroller parking I could've walked aroooooooooound this huge line or cut through it.  Deane cut through it and then I asked a lady with like a million kids if I could please just pass through in front of her...not like I wanted cuts or anything.  Instead of saying "sure go ahead" she chose to say ABSOLUTELY nothing and pushed her kids forward in line to fill up the gap where I was trying to get through...then the dumb.................lady just stared at me like she was making some sort of stand or something...I wanted to punch............anyway--so I finally yelled across the line at Deane that I would go around.  I wanted to yell SOMETHING ELSE...the best part though was after we'd gotten situated and were in line, the line inside the Jungle Cruise is one of those typical windy lines that make you backtrack like a million times and makes you feel like you're standing still.  So by the time we got inside, the dumb..................lady was already in line way ahead of us...but the way the line went, she was actually only about 4 feet away from us...so the whole time she was there, I just stood there and stared back at her like she did to me when she was being a...............and wouldn't let me pass through.   Stupid dumb.............................lady.    Anyway--I think I'm done telling you my "ignorant people encounter" (I have atleast one every time I go to Disneyland) so I'm gonna go *smile*

       da dum da dum...da dum da dum...here comes the bride....................   .............................ALL FAT AND WIIIIIIIDE!!!  OK that was a cheap shot at myself and PROBABLY a bit on the uncalled for side...however...I do have some good news to sprout.   Deane and I have set a tentative wedding date for next May! I'm not going to post the actual date, because if for some reason we change our minds, I don't want to explain it.  We do have it picked though.  We've also got our guest list finished (just need lots-o-addresses) and also maybe a location picked out.  How exciting huh? And you've been wondering what I've been doing all week!!!    And while I'm talking about weddings...Congratulations to  urlLink Lynn  and Rich on their wedding today!!! I hope they had a wonderful day and are enjoying themselves!!!  How exciting.  Today we went to a birthday party for our friends son.  He turned 2 yesterday.  It was a lot of fun, and afterwards, since we were again in Deane's old neighborhood he drove me around again and showed me some more places he used to hang out when he was in High School!  It was fun and definetly nice to be out and about.  We were going to stay overnight down in Anaheim so we could get up early and go to Disneyland, but changed our minds and are now just planning on going tomorrow sometime.    This week was just so hectic and busy that I didn't have much time to do any computer stuff.  I read other blogs, but didn't do any posting or emailing.  That's ok though, atleast I'm busy :-)  Deane went to the store just now to get some milk for our grumpy butted daughter, who is now throwing a monster-sized tantrum in her crib.  I don't know where she learned it, but somewhere along the daycare line she's picked up smacking and hitting...which is really uncool and mean.  So when she gets upset at us, she hits us right in the face!!! It actually does hurt and is just mean.  So when she started hitting me, I just put her in her crib so she could cry it out alone.  I feel bad because I can hear her, but if she won't stop hitting me and won't listen when I say "no" then I'm not going to put up with it!  Cry cry cry.  She's good at it.   Anyway--I think I ate waaaay to much at the party.  I wasn't really hungry and then we got there and I ate a TOOOON of potato chips and some dip and cake and stuff and then we went to a sub place afterwards to get dinner and man oh MAN am I stuffed UUUUUUUUGH!!!  Good news though...I think...the pants I just bought at  urlLink Costco  are too big for me!!!  I just bought them like 2 months ago and they're all baggy and stuff...so hopefully that means I'm starving myself enough to lose some weight.  OK I'm NOT starving myself (I can only imaging my mom's eye bugging out of her head at the site of reading that) I'm just ... cutting down on what I eat and how much I eat...I still eat a little...just not as much as I used to...which is ok with me.  My poor stomach has shrunk though and today I over ate so now I feel bloated and gross. *ugh*    OK I have to go get her.  She's such a grumpus.  Usually she stops crying after about 5 minutes and calms down, but she's still going at it in there, so I'll go get her and save her from throwing up, which she'll eventually do.   *sigh* The wonders of parenthood...

       monday mission   I saw this on  urlLink Kamie's blog  and she got it from  urlLink here . It looked interesting and since there was no Friday Five last week, I thought I'd try it.    1. Is there anything you used to be able to do physically that you no longer can? What changed?   I used to be able to run and do sports, and other phys. ed type activities, but after I broke my ankle, that limited what I could do and then I stopped going to therapy and have lost a bunch of motion in my ankle, so now when I run, it sort of looks like my left leg just sort of thuds along LOL...ok, it's not THAT bad...but that's how it feels when I do anything faster than a walk.    2. If you could go to lunch with someone famous, anyone living or dead, who would you choose? What questions would you ask them?   I would go to lunch with hmmm...someone rich of course...probably a celebrity or someone like that.  I just want to know what it's like to be that rich and that famous...I mean, how different are they really?  What do they do when they aren't in "the limelight"...do they wear sweat pants around the house?  Do they do their house cleaning and cooking (some of them DO!!!) Stuff like that...I'm fascinated with it and I don't know why.   3. On that same thought, there are probably several Bloggers you enjoy reading but have never met in real life. Which one Blogger would you most like to meet for dinner? Why did you pick that person? What would you talk about? What do you have in common? What would you do after dinner?   Probably either  urlLink Kamie .  I pick her because she seems like an interesting person that's very intelligent and would be fun to hang out with!  We'd probably talk about the same stuff we talk about on here...our husbands, things we like to do, places we've grown up or been...things we have in common...hmmm...we're both from small towns, we're both in relationships with guys we've met online 5 years ago and we're the same age.  After dinner...hmmm...probably just hang out somewhere!!!   4. Money (or the lack thereof) is the number one cause of arguments amongst couples. Do you find this to be true? If there really was a "Money Tree" you could go an pick, would this really solve a couple's problems?   I don't think Money is the number one cause of arguments in MY relationship...we have money problems, but we dont' tend to argue about them...we agree on things financially and I think we both agree that things could be a lot harder for us.  I don't think Money should be the center problem in any relationship and if it is, there are probably bigger problems under the surface. I don't think an endless supply of money would solve any problems...if me and Deane were gabillionaires, we'd still have our other problems...we'd still bicker about "the girl from new york" and we'd still have our other disagreements...riches doesn't change that.    5. Speaking of arguments, have you ever been drawn into any nasty, hateful arguments? The kind where hurtful things were said that had nothing to do with the fight at hand? What was that all about? How did it turn out?   I can only think of one...it was right after I broke my ankle...me and Deane got into an argument...I don't want to share it though *smile*      6. When was the last time you had to admit you were wrong about something? How did that go?   The last case I can think of was yesterday.  Deane was reading my blog and the entry with all the interesting facts on it had one untrue one in it.  I don't care!  They're funny.  But it seemed like he was on a mission to prove to me that I was wrong about it...so he searched the internet for the answer and it turned out the fact was untrue...it just sort of deflated my whole day and made me feel dumb.      7. Now for a slight change of theme....what song should never have been written?   That's easy...any song that Leanne Rimes has ever sang...and a new one that's on all the freakin' time called "Unsinkable Ships"...I don't know the guy that sings it, I dont' stick around long enough to find out.

         meat sticks?   That just SOUNDS gross!    Today was Hannah's first day in her new, safe daycare.  We've decided to turn her last daycare into Child Welfare...she came home tonight all happy and smiley, when normally she'd come home a bit grumpy and upset...so we really feel like we've done the right thing.  I went into the store tonight and bought her some  urlLink food  for lunches and stuff...the one thing I absolutely will NOT buy for her are the "meat sticks"  they look as gross as they sound...I bought her the fruit dices though and she likes though...as well as the microwavable meals and some juice and crackers to pack in her little lunch :-) It's so cute and so fun packing her a lunch.  I also got her a new  urlLink sippy cup  so she'd have one for home and one for daycare. It just seems easier to keep one there and one here...so it doesn't get lost in transit.    Anyway-tonight we went over to Frank and Christies and hung out with them.  It was so nice to see them! We don't see them very often, they are usually busy these days, but tonight we hung out and Hannah totally showed off.  We watched MNF with Frank because his Rams were playing.  We left during the 3rd quarter, but the Rams had just  urlLink scored another touchdown , so it looked like they had that one wrapped up.  My coworker Moe will be quite upset tomorrow I'm sure...if Chicago would've won tonight she would've taken the football pool for the 2nd week in a row...the 3rd time this season...the guys she plays in the pool with are getting really tired of the women winning and some of them are pulling out of it...I think Moe is one of three or four other women that have won the pool this season...whatta bunch of wussy-boys huh?  These are women that have played this pool every year for like 3 years and have NEVER won until this year...I say GOOD FOR THE WOMEN!!! LOL...the only time I really ever watch Football is when we're over at Franks...and I admit, I have no idea what's going on, but it gets exciting...especially when Frank starts throwing pillows LOL...  Anyway--nightie night bloggie world!!!

       ...   Today was fun! After Deane got back from Palmdale (he went out there to get Hannah a dresser!!!) we went to the  urlLink Promenade ...which is where we used to go when we lived in Sherman Oaks, to see all of our movies.  But now we only get there once in awhile, and since we have Hannah, it's normally only to window shop *smile*  After we browsed  urlLink Barnes and Noble  we went into  urlLink Chick's Sporting Goods  and Deane tried on a *GAG* Anaheim Angels hat *GAG* ...  after that we goofed around with baseball bats and catchers helmets hehehe...  We took Hannah to the Pizza Cookery and saw a total mob family eating dinner...ok...maybe not the mafia...but the grandfather (or "papa" as they called him) could have TOTALLY been a boss.  They sat down and as soon as the waiter put their hot rolls down it was like a feeding frenzy at the zoo.  There was one little boy that I woulda totally been all about setting straight...little *(&#$% wouldn't last 5 minutes in my house LOL...All we heard out of him was "I can do it...let me do it...give it to me...why are you always taking their sides?"  "Papa, why do you always criticize and blame me for everything?"  'Papa's response..."WELL...because you're the one that's always starting crap with your sisters!"  The boy than proceeded to get all grumpified because they wouldn't let him have his huge-ass rootbeer all to himself...little whiny-pants.  UGH...I've never heard a kid whine or complain or be such a little...*(&(%%($ in all my life.    Anyway--enough of that.   After dinner Deane took me up to the top of Topanga Canyon and scared the holy living daylights out of me on the windingest, curviest road I've ever seen in my life.  We used to go up there all the time when we lived in Sherman Oaks, but I don't remember it being so scary back then.  After we came back down it we drove around in his old neighborhood and he showed me where he went to school,  urlLink Saint Mels , until he was in the 8th grade.  It was fun driving around listening to his stories *smile* I wish I could take him back to KF and show him around...oh, wait...I did that already and it only took about 20 minutes to show him the whole place *loud knee slapping laugh*   Goodnight!!!

        *WARNING* MUSHY ENTRY    Mmmmmm know how sometimes one little thing can come along and make all your bad icky feelings inside wash away without any notice at all?  Lastnight I went to bed all grumpy and feeling sad for everything going on...and then me and Deane cuddled and talked a bit and then we woke up this morning he cuddled with me some more and made me laugh and feel good...and now I feel great again.   Maybe I just missed him...*sigh*  I feel close to him again though and that makes me feel good :-)  On a less mushy note...I was reading this story today...you can read it  urlLink here .  It's about a tree that's in danger of being cut down to make way for a road into a new housing development.  I don't understand it really...I do love trees, they are very pretty and good for the environment...but it is JUST a tree...it's not like a whole forest is getting chopped down or something to make room for the road...just one tree...whatever...maybe I'm not used to the way people are here in California...I grew up hearing about how all the people here were environmentalists (which they are all not like that) who would come to Washington to protest our logging industry...and I grew up, truthfully...not liking Californians *giggle* now I am one (I'm a Californian...not an environmentalist)...how ironic.  Funny how life leads you down paths you never thought you'd explore.

        slowly coming back to life   OK So I'm feeling a little better.  Yesterday was rough though...I was sick to my stomach all day and tired and stressed out.  Worried sick about Hannah and finding her a new daycare...one that wasn't going to bankrupt us but that would also keep her safe.  We found one...it's almost $100 more a week than what we were paying "the chicken-fat lady" ... but anything is better than that environment, and like Deane says "You get what you pay for" so we're definetly willing to shell out that much more money to ensure better safety and a more caring environment for her.    Today I felt sick too...not able to keep any food down.  I was so tired that my eyes were totally closing on me all morning and my co-worker kept looking over at me and saying "Sarah...are you there? Are you awake?" UGH...so on my lunch break, I slept for 45 minutes and that revived me and kept me going the rest of the day.  I am so back-logged at work with stuff that's been sitting on my desk waiting for me to do it, but I've been so tired and sick lately I haven't had the energy to do anything except sit there and moan a little and rub my stomach.    One of my friends left work today too *frown*  She used to come down everyday at 5 when she'd get off work and talk to me until 5:30 when I get off work...it kept me from going completely insane.  She quit though so she could back to school...good for her of course...sad for me *frown*    *SiGh* That's about all.  Life is just sort of sucking lately and I dont' want to bring everyone down with my sinking ship.

        sooooo tired...   Yesterday when Deane went to pick Hannah up from Daycare, he saw Hannah and another little kid sitting on a patio unattended...5 or 10 feet from the gate that's usually open that goes out onto the two busy streets...HELLO!!!???  The lady that watches her was very non-chalant about it saying "Oh, gosh...she was here a second ago!" HELLO!!!???  What makes it worse, is now I'm thinking, well if it's happened yesterday, how many OTHER times has it happened?  Hmmm...so we're taking her out of this daycare as soon as possible and finding a nicer, cleaner, safer one.  I'm really upset about it...whatever.    Not much else to post...that's just how life's been going lately.

        not much to say really...   Why am I online? Oh yeah...to check email...although normally, my email box is empty *frown*  I was just visiting  urlLink our friends'  website and stuff...but that is about all.   Hannah has been grumpy tonight and really hard to be around...which is making things tough for us tonight, so things feel a bit strained.  Plus, the depressing realization that we are probably NOT going to see my family AGAIN this year for the Holidays is bringing me down...so I'm just gonna go.

        mmmmmmmm the smell of rain...   I don't know what it is about wind and rain but it smells sooooooo good.   urlLink The Santa Anna's  are kicking up pretty good tonight and we might get more rain...It was pretty warm and sunny today though...we drove out to Palmdale for a friends daughters 4th birthday party.  It was a lot of fun and Hannah fit right in with all the kids there.  It's nice to watch her interact with other kids.  Her favorite toy though was a pink lawn chair for little kids.  She wouldn't sit in it for long, but she'd pull it around behind her all over the place...we wouldn't let her take it upstairs though lol.  Since her daughter is 4 now, Victoria had a bunch of toys and a bag of clothes that her daughter wouldn't play with or couldn't wear and she gave them to us...Hannah has enough clothes now to last her until she's 12 lol.   She's also giving us a dresser for Hannah...she found out we were keeping them on our spare bed, and she told us to take a dresser that she had in her garage...so that will be soooooo nice when we get that here.    Our date lastnight was fun too.  We had dinner at  urlLink Mimi's Cafe  and then we went and saw  urlLink Punch Drunk Love . With  urlLink Adam Sandler  and  urlLink Emily Watson .  I really liked it...we both did.  The movie was really good, really strange and I think that a lot of people wouldn't understand it...but I thought it was good.  It was filmed about 4 miles from where we were watching it...so that was funny.    Anyway--Deane, my hero, just got Hannah to bed...so I'm going to go stand outside on the balcony in the wind and try not to catch pneumonia...it just smells so good outside :-)

        friday five    I know that I don't normally do the  urlLink Friday Five ...but Deane and Hannah are both in bed and I don't have anyone to play with *frown* so I'm going to play on the computer.     1. Did you vote in your last elections?  No, but I AM registered to vote. I registered on September 21st...which made me eligible for the elections this last week...but I didn't know anything about the stuff I'd have been voting for...and didn't want to vote like that...you know...Like I don't care or something...so I think it'd be better not to know and not to vote, then not to know and vote..................but...I guess even better than that would be to know and to vote...but...oh cripes...no, I didn't vote!!!   2. Do you know who your elected representatives are?  No...*giggle* I don't even know who the mayor is...and to think I almost worked at City Hall...cripes!!!   3. Have you ever contacted an elected representative? If so, what was it about?  I think in my hometown...wonderfully small Kettle Falls...one of our representatives owned the local feed store and I KNOW we used to buy hay and grain there   for our horses...so yeah...in a way, I contacted him for SOMETHING...OH and there was one time, in the same, wonderfuly small town, when I lived next to the Governor of my State and his daughters were there visiting him and I took them horse back riding...I don't know if that counts though...   4. Have you ever participated in a demonstration?  Uhhh...not really...I've complained a lot with other people...but mostly in High School about crappy homework assignments and stuff...   5. Have you ever volunteered in an election? What was the result?  Hmmm...not in like a "big" election.  I was a member of 4-H for several years and I ran for club president...AND THE RESULT WAS ME WINNING! WOO HOO! THAT'S RIGHT BABY...I was IN CHARGE!!! YAAAAAH!!!  LOL...since then the group has fallen apart and none of us really ride horses anymore...*scratching my head* hmmm...

        RAAAAAAAIN YAAAAAAAAY   Nothing like rain to pull me out of a deep dark depression...not to mention my cold!  The basketball that was in my throat lastnight is gone, but now my nose is pretty runny and my head is a bit light feelin'...but I shall be fine because it's RAINING! It started yesterday on our way out the door in the morning...and rained off and on all day yesterday and then today it rained steadily all day!!! YAY FOR ME! I LOVE RAIN!!! We had power outages lastnight too...just two of them right in a row and luckily we were awake when they hit, so we were able to reset our clocks and wake up on time!  I was watching the rain fall all day while I sat behind my desk at work and reeeeeally was achin' to go puddle stompin' in the parking lot like we used to do in High School...er...I mean...uh...Elemantary School...  Deane is sick tonight.  Kind of a funny story though...tonight when we got done eating  urlLink dinner , Deane decided he was going to take a nice hot bath...and he takes REEEALLY hot baths...he's in there for maybe 30-35 minutes...enough to make his legs and arms all red and burned looking...he comes walking out our bedroom holding the thermometer in his hand and says "Sorry, honey...I really need to go to bed...I have a fever..." The thermometer said 100 degrees... HELLO! ...OF COURSE it is!!! You were just in a hoooooooooooot bath!!! LOL When I told him that, he said "No, I've been out of the bath for like 5 minutes..." OK but your legs are still beeeeeat red and your face looks like a lobster!!! Wait like an hour and then decide if you're dying from a fever! *giggle*  It was cute.  He did go to bed early though...poor baby *frown*   I did the same thing lastnight.  I got home from work at 5:45 and by 5:53 I was in bed going to sleep!  I slept for a few hours, got up, ate some pizza and then went to bed again shortly after...I feel better though as a result of it.  Tomorrow we are going on a date!  We are leaving Hannah in the trusted hands of a babysitter...the same one that watched her while we went to the wedding in October.  And we are going to go see a movie.  We never get to see any though...and cripes! I just realized I posted this same thing the last time I posted...OK...I'm leaving :-)

       ***cough cough***   OK so I've been sneezing more than coughing today...but coughing just looks cooler...anyway, yeah, I'm sick.  UGH.  We have a babysitter for Saturday night though...so we get to go out to the movies!  It'll be the second movie we've seen in the theatre since March of 2001.  We don't even know what movies are playing anymore...so we'll have to research that I guess before we go.  I'm excited...and then on the 16th, a friend of Deane's is gonna watch her so we can have a night to ourselves with dinner and maybe another movie *fingers crossed*  how fun! Two weekends in a row...whatta nice treat...*sigh*   My hands are soooo cold.  I don't think I'm gonna post much tonight, I need to rest some.  I'm very dizzy and a bit funky feeling...sort of wavy...if that makes sense...and I have a really bad sore throat...so I'm gonna go :-)

         sooooo glad to be back online    OK so I grumbled a bit and maaaaybe threw a teeeeny tiiiiiny fit when Deane spent all Saturday Night and Sunday morning on the computer trying to fix it...but boy, am I glad he did!!!    Hannah had three  urlLink shots  yesterday!  Poor little kid, but whatta trooper!  Deane gave her some  urlLink Infant Tylenol  before they left for the appointment to sort of keep her from having another melt down like the one she last January when she had her first shots.    Today at work I got soooo sick! I thought I was going to throw up! Ugh!  The facilities guy painted our mail room, and the smell of the paint fumes filled up the entire accounting/human resources departments...and THEN as if THAT wasn't painful enough, at five when the warehouse shuts down, everyone flocks out the front door and of course leaves it open, and I guess a skunk had been hanging around outside and the smell got inside and so on top of the paint fumes I had to fight off skunk smell for 30 minutes.  I was so dizzy and lightheaded when I left!!!  Have I mentioned that I don't know what I would do without Deane?  He's so incredibly supportive and good to me.  This weekend in the midst of an almost mental breakdown, he sat with me and let me vent and then he just held me...he didn't try to *fix* things or make me feel like my feelings were invalid, or make me feel guilty for feeling some of the things I was feeling.  I was just so depressed and sad all weekend and yesterday to.  I don't know how he puts up with me, must be love huh?  He's great though...  I think my friend Angela has talked me into going to our holiday party at work...*sigh*  I wasn't going to go and I wasn't even going to tell Deane about it and wasn't going to talk to my coworkers about it...I was just going to not show up!  But today me and Angela were chatting via AOL Instant Messenger at work (Shhhh...not supposed to do that!) and she asked if I was going, so I told her no.  And in about 15 minutes she had listed about 1,000 reasons for me to go and only one for me to stay home (the one reason for me to stay home was if I wanted to show my coworkers what a butt-head I really am LOL) So I guess I'm going...*sigh*   Anyway--off I go!!!  My feet are sooooo very cold!  It was 42 when I got up this morning and right now it's 52...not cold compared to where I grew up...but definetly colder than it's been in South Cali for a long time!  Me and my mom just finished chatting...(shhhh...she doesn't know I was writing here while I was chatting with her LOL)

         a laaazy saturday    We didn't do ANYTHING TODAY! YAY!!! I really like it!!!  Deane woke up with Hannah at 7 and I got up around 10...Hannah took a nap around 11 and then me and Deane fell asleep until 1:30!!!  He woke up at 2:30 and now we're just sort of hanging out.  Hannah's rash I think is finally starting to bug her.  She's really warm because of it and I think that makes her really uncomfortable and irritable.  She's very lovie though and yesterday we discoved that she gives kisses :-) Real sweet kisses.   This morning she gave me a big hug and I thought she'd take off after she hugged me but she kept her arms around my neck and gave me a little baby kiss :-)  Soooooo sweet!!!    Anyway--we dont' have any plans tonight either...our cable is out so we've been watching a lot of movies...*sigh*  Today seems to be  urlLink Kevin Costner  day here.  He's probably one of my favorite actors...and today we watched  urlLink  Field Of Dreams  and  urlLink  Thirteen Days .  The first time we saw Thirteen Days was in the strangest movie theatre in Seattle and when they got to the line that said "The only city not in the range of these bombs would be Seattle."  Everyone in the theatre cheered and clapped LOL....just funny.     So yeah...we're not doing anything...which means I don't have much to say!!!  The weather here has been cold (for Southern California)  The low lastnight was 42! Right now it's 66 outside.  We have the heat on for little Hannah's sake since her room gets sooooo cold at night thanks to the vaulted ceiling in there.  Anyway--it's bad when I start talking weather, so I'm out of here!!!

        leave it to my baby...   ...to get the one disease we've never heard of.  It's called  urlLink Fifth Disease .  We've never gotten into see a doctor so quickly.  The nurse took one look at her sad little face and the rash and said "Let's get her into a room right now...in case....it's....contagious."  Tooooo funny.   She should be ok though and they said she could go back to daycare on Monday.  Apparently she's not contagious after the rash breaks out...it's the incubation period that's contagious.  So we'll see...she has another appt. with the doctor on Monday to get her shots and her physical...they wouldn't do it all for us today, they're making us come back.  So Deane will take her.  Other than that, I just hung out at home today with the Monkey!  We had fun though.  One nice thing about this rash is it doesn't make her sick or irritable and she doesn't fuss about it, so she's her regular funny little self, so we played a lot and watched movies until it was time to take the  urlLink train  (if you go to that webpage, we ride the Ventura County Line) into Glendale to meet Deane.  She got to see horses in Chatsworth (Where  urlLink Mister Ed  supposedly lived...) and planes landing at  urlLink  Van Nuys Airport .  On our way to the doctors, we drove past the place we used to live...Sherman Oaks...oooh good and bad memories...how interesting.  Anyway, the whole time we lived there, the  urlLink Sherman Oaks Galleria  was under reconstruction, so I never got to spend any time there.  Since we've been back though, we've eaten there at  urlLink The Cheesecake Factory . several times...but I've still never wandered through the mall part...it's supposed to be really nice, so I decided tonight when we drove by it that I want to go there one of these upcoming days and just hang out there *smile*    Anyway--we're both relieved that Hannah is ok and that the rash should be gone in a few days.  There's no medication for it, and since it's not contagious, we don't really have to worry about it.  I'm off to go relax now.

        blogger grumps   OK So I had two posts ready to go yesterday and lost both of them.  Blogger is doing some maintenance, so I suggest to those that use them, to copy and paste your posts into notepad before you hit Post and Publish...it's not really blogger's fault, they say they're working out the bugs, but just in case they haven't fixed it by the time you post next, I'd be careful :-)  Yes, thank you Jennie, Lynn, Q, and Kamie for the kind replies!  I am feeling a lot better.  Yesterday I was only a little better, but today I'm a lot better.  I think part of my problem was that I felt like me and Deane didn't have time together anymore and that maybe we were going in different directions for awhile.  The last two nights though, we've had some really good close time and have talked about a million things and gotten a lot of stuff out in the open...so today I feel much better.  We actually stayed home again today, not because we're sick but because we were up until 4 a.m. talking (our alarms go off at 5 a.m. and 5:50a.m...Yikes)  So we just stayed home again.  It's nice having all this time together.  I'm working on reconstructing my website.  I decided that I'm going to use this blog as my "page" page...but I'm going to use my geocities account for stuff like the "100 things about me" page and pictures and stuff like that...so that I don't clutter this one up with stuff like that.  Plus it'll keep it nice and simple!  Maybe I'll work on that later today...I'm 1/2 way done with the 100 Things project...but it gets tough after awhile and I start just putting in dumb stuff and then erase it when I feel myself getting on the wrong track LOL...I also decided to un-join the web groups I'm part of...with exception to  urlLink Online Wives  and my  urlLink Bloggers Group ...but all of my other web rings and such I've stepped out of...there's just too much demand and pressure on people in those groups, I couldn't keep up with it anymore!!!  My brother's Christmas box got here! His wife and him got us some gifts and Hannah one too...we opened them and I got some really good smelling lotions and hand wash...they smell like Country Apple.  Deane got a razor set...he likes it, but only really uses razors like this one on certain occasions...because he can't shave with it in the shower or something...but he likes it and will hopefully use it :-)  Hannah as usual made out like a bank robber...she got a cool snail toy/book...it's so fun, I almost wanted to keep it for myself LOL...just kidding.  She didn't even let me get it out of the package before she started screaming "MINE MINE MINE" and trying to grab it.  She's been sucking on his nose all morning.    Anyway--thanks again to those that replied!  I like knowing I have people that will listen to me and understand the things I'm going through.  I can tell Deane everything, and I do, but when I start telling him how homesick I am and how much I miss my family, I know even though he doesn't want too, he starts feeling bad about it and blaming himself, and that makes me feel worse since I don't want him to take it that way...Sigh...it's an ongoing battle :-)  So it's good to know I have people out there with non-judgemental opinions.    Anywho--I think Hannah just threw herself against the bedroom door, so I better go see what she's doing.  Did I mention that she's learned how to take her clothes off? Oh yes.  Her diaper too...this morning she was playing in her crib after she woke up, and when we went in to get her, she'd taken her PJ's off and her diaper and had managed to pee and poo in her crib...she did the same thing on Sunday...twice...in less than 72 hours...*sigh*  babies.................OH and Deane's been having dreams about us where we have not only Hannah but a son too...hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...  Happy New Years!!!

        *sigh*   Today was a lazy boring day.  I thought I'd be okay with sitting on our butts all weekend not doing a single thing with our spare time...but it turns out I get a lot restless and hate sitting around.  We did get over to the library today, 15 minutes before it closed, and got our library cards...didn't have time to look at any books though of course...so maybe we'll go back, if we're not to busy doing nothing.    That's not fair.  We do things...not the types of things I imagined I'd be doing when I was 12 and looking into my future...but the things we do are fun and family oriented...I'm trying very hard to be positive and happy about my life.  I have a lot of things to be thankful for.  We were up until 4:30 a.m. talking about why I'm so miserable and unhappy.  I think I scared him when I said all I wanted to do was go home...I think he thought I meant I wanted to leave him and move home...what I meant was, that in order for me to feel like things really truly are getting better for us, two things need to happen...1, we have to have to have to have to have to HAVE TO get married and 2, I need to see my family more than once a year.  I thought I'd feel better after telling him how I feel, but for some reason I came out of it feeling a bit worse.  I don't know what to do anymore...I'm just tired of this exhausting feeling in my stomach. Maybe I'm just not being creative enough.  I complained that our apartment is always messy, no matter how much we clean it, it's always a disaster...I feel so claustrophobic in here.  When we first moved in, it felt big...and it's gradually getting smaller and smaller.    UGH, I have to go.  I hope everyone had a less-whiny weekend than me.

        OK...it's OVER    I got to work early on Thursday and took down all of the decorations me and Moe had put up.  Why? BECAUSE CHRISTMAS IS OVER!  Decorations get so cluttered and almost messy looking after awhile.  I got so tired of it.  After I took them down and cleaned up, I looked at it and it was so nice and neatly organized...I felt cleaner.  I of course got a bunch of flack for taking them down so soon...but who cares? CHRISTMAS IS OVER!!!  Get over it.  See me in 12 months when I decorate for next year.    Anyway--I do love Christmas though...we had a good Christmas.  I already wrote about Christmas Eve, but Christmas day was fun.  We slept in until 10:30 (Yikes, since we were due at his mom's house at noon)  and opened our presents.  Even Hannah opened hers...sort of.  I started opening one for her and thought she'd like to do it herself since she normally loves ripping stuff...but she ripped it until she saw the toy inside and then just sat and tried to pull the toy out.  I got a DVD,  urlLink The Fast and the Furious , which I'd wanted...I keep explaining that it's because it's a good movie, but everybody seems to know that I just reeeeeeally have a thing for Vin Diesel.  Wowzer.   Anyway--*ahem*  I also got a Conair Thermal Spa Bath Mat...(I'd go and find a link for it, but I dont' want to know how much it costs...) It's soooo nice :-)   His sister-and-brother got me a new book to read...it's 204 Rosewood Lane by Debbie Macomber...it's the second book in a series...the first book, 16 Lighthouse Road, I read when it first came out.  It's based in a town called Cedar Cove, Washington...which is actually Port Orchard Washington which is right across the bay from Seattle...so I really like it.    Yesterday, or lastnight I guess...we went out to dinner at the Elephant Bar...it was so nice, then we went and played at Costco for a bit (I LOOOVE that store)...and today was a veeeeeeerrrrrry lazy day.  We woke up and went to feed Otis, and then out to lunch at Tommy's....and then home again to watch Pinocchio...we ended up napping until 4:30 and then his friend Scott, who moved to Las Vegas last summer, came over and watched Groundhog Day with us and then we ordered BBQ from Reds...tooooo good.  Now we're just hanging out, doing our own things.  I'm about to go watch Pinocchio again, I fell asleep the first time we tried to watch it and plus, it was a bad copy of the DVD (my theory is NEVER RENT DVD'S!!!)  Deane cleaned it though, so hopefully we'll get to watch it finally.    The people we were house sitting for came home today, so we said goodbye to Otis!  I called to make sure they got him and I talked to John...he's a true/blue New Yorker, born and raised.  When I asked him how the trip was he said "I'm writing a book about it...I'm either going to call it "The Best F_____G Christmas Ever!" Or "An Epic Tale Of A Middle Class Family Christmas In New Jersey"   TOOOOOO FUNNY...   Goodnights!!!

        Mmmmm Family...   Even if it's not the family I was born into...spending time with family...a close family...or even two...is great on Christmas.  Tonight we went over to Frank and Christy's and her family was all over there as well as Deane's brothers...we played a fun game... urlLink Balderdash . Fun game...we could've used that link to the rules a couple of times though LOL We didn't use the board or anything, we just split up into teams and played like that...funner that way.    OH MAN...My mom sent ME (no, I'm NOT sharing!) some yummy-fied-delicious-scrumptious candy ... mmmmmmmmm...sooo good.  Deane is in the living room being all sneaky wrapping my presents and so I high-jacked the candy and brought it in here with a diet coke and the movie  urlLink Tommy Boy .  I LOOOOVE this movie...this one and  urlLink Black Sheep .  Tooo funny.    Tonight we went to Target to buy Hannah her presents...and they were CLOSED! I tell you ALL...I almost started crying. I felt like such a failure and felt like I was ruining Christmas for Hannah...ugh.  That's a horrible gut-wrenching feeling...and yes, I realize she's not even old enough to know what's going on yet, but I know what's going on and I would feel so terribly opening my gifts and not having her have any...On our way down to the  urlLink Elephant Bar  to buy a Gift Certificate for someone (shhhh...I can't say who)  we drove by K-Mart and they were open, so we went in and got her a bunch of Fisher Price stuff...we got her the  urlLink FP Little People's Zoo , and the  urlLink FP Little People's Cement Mixer ...yeah, I know, that sounds like a toy for little boys...but the driver of the mixer is a GIRL! SO THERE! We also got her the  urlLink FP Chatterbox Phone .  She loves grabbing our cordless phone and holding it up to her ear...so we got her this one.  I can't remember who makes it though, and I can't find it on the FP website...so after she opens it tomorrow I'll have to put the link up :-)   Deane is still being all sneaky in the living room.  Hannah is in bed luckily...I'm glad we have a TV and a computer in here, or I'd be going crazy waiting for Deane to finish wrapping the prezzies...ugh.  HURRY UP! I had the boy scouts wrap my presents for me at the mall the other day. I suck at wrapping gifts...so I was glad to see the booth :-)    Anyway--Merry Christmas again everyone! I'm starting to get into the spirit of things little by little.  It helps to be around his family, they are so very kind and make me feel at home...which I'm not...and that's sad...but atleast there's an up-side to it...and I'm finally starting to see it.    Goodnight!!!       ***tiptoes quietly out to the living room to see what Santa is doing***

        A PUPPY!   For a week anyway...a friend of mine is out of town for the Holidays (lucky her!) and we volunteered to watch their dog, Otis for them while they're away.   Not in our apartment of course...but we go over to their house twice a day and feed him and play with him and love him...it's fun pretending for a few short moments that I have a dog.  God only knows when/if I'll ever have one of my own...so playing with other people's dogs will just have to do.  We did all of our Christmas shopping this last weekend.  Pretty pathetic...waiting til' the last minute huh? Nah, we didn't think so! It was fun.  I keep going back and forth on wanting to celebrate Christmas at all this year.   It's hard for me to get in the spirit, when all I want to do is be with my family.  I got Deane some nice presents I hope.  I'm always afraid that he'll open them and pretend to like them when on the inside he's thinking "Ohhhh, how creative...you got me things you heard me talk about but didn't really care if I got...what I REALLY wanted was...."  I KNOW he would NEVER EVER do something like that, but my crappy self-esteem just makes me feel like that.  I feel really good about the presents I get him until I pay for them and then I walk out of the store and think "Uhhh...maybe he doesn't want this as much as I think he does."  *sigh*  Just another reason I'm so undecided about Christmas...  My neice got a puppy for Christmas!!!  She got a  urlLink Rat Terrier  and she named her Camille! The pictures they sent me are ohhhh so cute...just makes me want a puppy or a dog even more now.  I've browsing  urlLink  Pet Finder  and looking at all the little puppies and dogs up for adoption in the Los Angeles area and it totally breaks my heart...there are people out there who discard their dogs like they're nothing when there are people out there like ME and DEANE who would give our left arm for a little puppy or a dog!!!  UGH! UNFAIR? YES!    I've also been researching  urlLink Portland, Oregon .  Why? Because.  I want to move there.  I want to be closer to my family and my friends. I get the sad feeling though that Deane doesn't like the idea of ever leaving here again...*sigh*  I'm just tired of having that sick-to-your-stomach feeling all the time from being so homesick.  Atleast if we lived in Portland we could visit my family on the weekends and stuff.  Oh, well.  Life.    Hmmm...what else?  Not much.  Oh!  The apple cake I baked for the potluck at work last Friday went over really well.  There were a ton of desserts there, but the people that tried the cake all really liked it and they ate about half of it.  I'm quite proud of it :-)  I also made that Chips-Ahoy! Pie and we've eaten part of it and I think the rest will have to be thrown out...not because it wasn't good, just because we haven't been home much to eat it, and it's been in the fridge since last Thursday!    Last weekend was fun. Like I said, we did our Christmas shopping, but on Friday night we took his mom out to dinner at  urlLink Red Robin  .  MMM It was soooo good.  I used to eat there a lot in Seattle because the place I worked was right over one...and they gave us a discount...then on Saturday night we had dinner with his mom again, and his brother who's home from  urlLink Creighton .  He made a yummy Prime Rib...mmmm...soooo good!!!    Anyway--tonight we went to the  urlLink Northridge Mall  to do some more last-minute-crowded-pushing-shoving-kicking Christmas Shopping for his mom and he snuck off to get me a gift...stinker!!! Wouldn't let me open the trunk afterwards either...I MAY have to open a can of whoop-ass on him later!!!    Off to bed!!! Goodnight!!!

        and again I say..."WHAT?"   I don't know...maybe it's me...but I don't really like people that say one thing, and then two minutes later say something that completely contradicts what they just said...like this "I never get to see my husband anymore...he works soooo much we don't have any time together anymore!"   Then goes on to talk about some other stuff and at the end of her email she says "Well, besides that, not much else is going on, just spending lots of time with my hubby and enjoying every second!"  HELLO? Did you NOT just say you never get to spend time with him anymore?  Make up your mind, either you want our pity or our envy, but don't go for both!!! UGH!  Maybe that was mean...but that's how I feel!    Anyway--tonight we went to Target, I had to get some stuff for work, Secret Santa stuff mostly...and some  urlLink Toys For Tots .  The presents had to be worth more than $5, so I found a bunch of toys on sale for exactly $5, so we picked out a toy for girls and a toy for boys...it was fun.  Toys For Tots is definetly my favorite charity.   We also got the ingredients for the Apple Cake I'm going to TRY and make tomorrow.  I almost passed out when I went to look at cake pans...they're like 20 bucks...no thank you.  So I cheated and bought the cheap-o tin ones...it's not like I'm going to turn into Betty Crocker and start baking everyday...so the $2 tin pans are just fine with me!   As we were shopping at Albertson's though, I saw the same metal cake pans that were at Target for $20 for only $9 at Albertsons...oh well...tin ones are fine.  We also bought a  urlLink Jell-O Chips AHoy!  pie.  It looked really good so I got it and will probably put it together this weekend, since it doesn't require any cooking time.  We didn't see the Oreo one, but Chips AHoy! is fine with us! YUM!!!  Anyway--Hannah is all tucked into bed.  She was soooo shleepy when we got home tonight, we had to run a bunch of errands after work, and she didn't sleep very much at daycare, so she is completely wiped out tonight!!!  I've been reading up on bottle-weaning...our doctor said she should be completely off the bottle by 18 months...that gives us about 2 1/2 months to convince her that her bottle is not Superman and that yes, she can indeed live without it!  So I've been reading up on it and hopefully in the next week or two, we'll be starting in on getting her off of it.   I think the hardest part will be taking it away from her at night.  We fell into the waaaay bad habit of giving her one at night when we lay her down, and now she can't go to bed without one *sigh*  Hopefully it will be as easy as taking the pacifier away...with that, we just stopped giving it to her and she didn't even notice or be bothered by it...so ****positive thinking****  She's a good baby.  Goodnight!!!

        monday???   OK...am I the only one that hasn't done ANY Christmas shopping? Everyone at work is boasting about their Christmas shopping being aaaaall done and how they aren't going to be one of those last-minute-dash-out-of-the-house-on-Christmas-Eve-to-get-a-few-meager-gifts-at-Target shoppers.  UHHHHH THAT'S ME! HELLO!?? Then the people that don't get gifts from me will get an online gift or something.    Anyway-today was Monday...big deal.  Just another day right?  It rained and rained and rained and rained here in LA...so much so that it's flooding and stuff...what they don't realize is that it's not actually THAT much rain, we just haven't gotten this much in like 2 years...and the city won't clean out the drainage systems, so the leaves and gunk build up in them and then when it rains, the water has no where to go, and the "Southland" ends up looking like  urlLink this .  *sigh*   I do love the rain though.  Goodnight!!!

       and on the seventh day...    ....they rested....and it was ohhhhhhhh sooooooooooooo nice.  This is the first Sunday in a long line of Sundays where we've done nothing. MMMM...yummy.  Deane and Hannah are both napping and I'm watching the end of  urlLink Mr. Hollands Opus .  When it first came out me and two friends went to see it and didn't like it...we threw M&M's at the movie screen and stuck gum to the bottom of our chairs...we called it "Mr. Hollands Dopus" if I recall correctly.  Then we went to the hospital to see my mom and my grandma and pulled our pants down in some thorny bushes to moon my mom and ended up falling over in them...hmmm...now that I'm much older and a little more mature (not toooooo much more mature though) I think I might be able to appreciate it a little more.    I finished my book!!!  It's the first new book I've read in foooorever! I love reading, and since I haven't had any money to buy new books, I've been recycling through all my old books that I've read a million times.  Last time we were at Costco though, Deane told me he was going to buy  urlLink Episode 2 , so I said--fine, I'm getting a new book then!  So I got  urlLink White Oleander .  Gooood book, now I want to see the movie, even though I know it went be soo good.    Anyway--Deane just hit me with a pillow so I have to go kick his butt.

        heaaadache!!!   OHHH YES, I've got a pounding headache! WOO HOO!!! It hurts!!!  In response to my mom's tag earlier I must reply with...What baking???  LOL.  The potluck at work isn't until next Friday, and I think I've decided to wait and bake the goodies for next week.  For those of you that don't know what I mean, my mom sent me some yummy recipes for Apple Cake and Black Bottom Cupcakes.  I highly doubt Deane's faith in Apple Cake...and as for Black Bottom Cupcakes...hmm...I don't think so on those either since they have cream cheese in them.  *hmph* So I'll force them on my unsuspecting coworkers!   Tonight we had a little bit of fun.  We were in the drive-thru at  urlLink Carl's Jr.   and Deane said he hated making left turns...so I bet him $1 that he couldn't get home again without making atleast one left turn!  So we went...and went...and went...we went down backstreets we didn't know existed...he turned around in driveways of homes we didn't know...and finally...eventually...got home...and amazingly enough, our food was still hot when we got home.  So I owe him a dollar now.  It was fun...I DID try to change the rules once I clued into the driveway swith-a-roos he was pulling...but I'll pay up.    I'm not sure what our  plans are for this weekend.  It's supposed to rain all weekend! WOO HOO!!!  I've been suffering from some sort of minor-fatigue I think this week.  I've been really shaky and tingly all over...I wake up tired and want to sleep some more...stuff like that...I'm feeling a little better today, but still not 100%.   The lady I work with has been out sick all week, so I've been doing double work at the front desk...which is ok, since I did that for a year and a half at my last job...but that was over a year ago, I think I forgot how tiring it gets.  I liked it though,  I don't mind working alone.  I miss Moe though and hope she comes back on Monday...I like having someone to talk to and goof around with *smile*   Anywho--I guess it's time to move along...goodnight!

        yay! a visitor!!!    I was asleep...I mean sooooound asleep...and Deane comes in from the balcony saying "Sarah, get up you have a visitor!!!"  I'm totally confused and thinking he's joking with me to wake me up..."Wake up Sarah, you have a visitor!!!"  So I sit up and just as I'm saying "Who?" There's a knock on our door! My friend Katie, that used to work at the same place I do came over to see me! It was sooo fun!  I love having company!    I went back to work today, which is a good thing since the lady I work with called in sick.  I didn't do much work at all today, mostly just stared into space a lot.  I still wasn't feeling too well and was a bit stressed out...the afternoon atleast went by quickly for me though. Deane stayed home today, so I had a lunch date with him and Hannah, we ate at  urlLink Del Taco .  One of our favorite places to eat.   Anyway--not much else really.  Like I said, did a lot of napping tonight.  We had dinner at  urlLink KFC .  I found a listing for a  urlLink Bob's Big Boy  in our phone book, so we drove down there to the address listed in the phone book and it wasn't there! It was a  urlLink COCO's !!! For crying out loud.  So anyway...that was our exciting night, driving all over Simi Valley for the restaurant that wasn't there!!!  Ugh, I just swallowed a piece of ice that was maybe a little too big...ugh.  Have to go now :-)

         Happy Birthday Annie Fannie!!!   Tonight is my best friend Anne's birthday...I almost forgot about it *cringe*     Anyway--I found out some upsetting news today!  I know I told some of you about it when it happened in September, but I was supposed to have a friend of mine move in with us, she was going to take care of Hannah for us...well the day she was supposed to show up, she never came...and I still haven't heard from her.  I heard through the grapevine she was back in Seattle...anyway...Today I found out through the same grapevine that she is talking to all my friends up there! HELLO...I still haven't heard from her!   Does anyone see this as a problem?  If you do something THAT huge to a friend isn't the decent thing to do is offer some sort of apology or even an explanation?  Yeah...me too.  Oh, well.  I've asked my friends up there to please give me her phone number so I can call her.  This is just ridiculous.  Anywho--I stayed home sick today.  At first it was just an upset stomach, but then I started getting all shivery and cold...and the heat was on and I was under the blankets, so I knew something was wrong...and then I got really hot and sweaty and couldn't sleep, and was all weak feeling and sick.  UGH.  I took some sudafed and it's finally starting to feel like a normal temperature in here to me.  It's like 47 outside and I just went outside on the porch to cool down.  UGH.    Goodnight!!!

        ((SINGING LOUDLY))"there's no business......like SNOOOOOOOOW business..."   Had ya thinkin' it snowed here huh? Yeah...right.    I'm glad to see I'm not the only mint chocolate chip ice cream fan (Thanks Q! LOL)    Yesterday we went to  urlLink Sears Portrait Studio  at the  urlLink  Northridge Mall .   Very fun day.  We were in and out of there in less than an hour, and we didn't have an appointment or anything...we thought we'd be stuck there all day waiting for a session.  Hannah totally stole the show though, she was smiling all over the place and clapping her hands and everything.  We picked out some great pictures of us all together and one of just me and Hannah.    The Hawaiian Luau actually was fun too.  Deane ended up wearing my grass skirt.  I wasn't wearing it right or something because it didn't go all the way around my waist...after we left I realized that I just hadn't had it tied on tight enough.  *sigh*  it's ok...still a fun night.  It took me awhile to figure out why they were theming the party "Hawaiian"  and then when we got there they were watching Pearl Harbor and I realized that the date was December 7th...so it sort of clicked in.  Kind of strange...celebrating Pearl Harbor Day on your birthday...but...eh...whatever.   It was fun.   We got them a 9 lb. Nestle Crunch Bar...it was the biggest hit at the party...Deane felt a little guilty that it totally overshadowed the other gifts, but I didn't care, I loved it!!! *smile*  (Deane works for Nestle for those of you that don't know)    Anyway--not sure what we are going to be up to today...I haven't been posting much...I've actually been..............BUSY! WOOHOO!!!     Time to get goin I guess!!! Have a great Sunday...

        there's nothing like mint ice cream on a coooold night!   OK so I've been playing A LOT of  urlLink Playstation  the last couple of days...I have serious little sore thumbs now and my eyes are all bugged out and stuff...it's from not having cable...hopefully our cable will be fixed tomorrow so I can "just say no" to the playstation.    Anyway--Hannah is in the tub playing and Deane is over-seeing it...I love quiet "Sarah" time.   I wish we had more of it.   Tonight we went into  urlLink Wal-Mart .  I hate that store and any store like it.  UGH UGH UGH.  Small cramped aisles, lousy rude people.  Cashiers that don't know which end of a dog the food goes in...*sigh*  This one though was remarkably different.  So is the  urlLink Target  here in Simi Valley.  Still the cramped aisles...but not messy and out of order like other ones I've been in.  ANYWAY--the whole purpose was to tell you WHY we were there.   We're skipping my company's holiday party to go to a Hawaiian themed birthday party for two of our friends.  One of the reasons I thought we'd go to this party instead of my work one is because I wouldn't have to go out and buy a new outfit.   We went out looking for Hawaiian stuff to wear to the party and ended up at  urlLink  Party America  and spent...GET THIS...$44 on stuff...HELLO...I could've bought a new dress for the holiday party for that much money.  UGH...no more themed parties for Sarah!    Deane got a hibiscus shirt and a weird hat called a beachcomber.  I just got a grass skirt and a leis.  Oh Deane got a leis too...then we got them a card...for almost $50...*sigh*    So let's see...I haven't been posting much, you'd think I have a ton to say...but I sadly don't.  No new news on my friend Scott...the one that was in the car accident.  So I guess I'll go! Hannah is done with her bath sounds like, so I'll go play with her.  She lost her pants at daycare today *scratching my head*  She went to daycare wearing a winnie the pooh outfit, complete with little pants...and when we went to pick her up she's standing in the middle of the room in these big baggy red shorts...toooo funny...our little "homey"...*chuckle*    Nighties!!!

        sad news    *frown* I just got a letter from my best friend Anne...she told me a friend of ours from high school..someone I've known since Kindergarten actually...was in a bad car accident in Louisiana and doesn't remember anything.  It's terrible!  I hope he's ok.  Apart from that, Hannah is still not sleeping at all during the nights...she's up right now in her crib being all fussy.  I think I'm going to just let her cry...she needs to get back on a normal schedule.    Anyway--time for bed!

       wow...easier done than said!   That was the easiest time I've had so far changing the colors...it must get easier the more I do it...and trust me, I've done it a lot...I just screwed up more times than I care to admit :-)  Hannah is sooooooound asleep on the living room floor and Deane is out running around.  He was only supposed to take the cans to the recycling place, but he's been gone too long for that, so I have a feeling he's over at his brother's house..........or at "Snooky's"  (He'd know what that was LOL)    I have health insurance now! YIPPEE!!! YAY!!!  HOORAH FOR ME!!! I just have to remember who my doctor is and stuff like that...I need to have a check-up, I haven't been since I was in the hospital with Hannah...so I'm due...plus I need to go to the *cringe* *shiver* dentist *shiver* *cringe*  I hate dentists. Ugh.    Anyway--I have to go.  I'm going to wake up Hannah so she won't wake up in the middle of the night..................again.  She probably needs a bath too, she has cheese ravioli all over her little face and smells....like....a ....   foot??? :-)    Goodnight!

        time for a change!    Hi gang!  OOOH so busy lately!  Well...not really.  But oh well.  Things are getting better...I think I was just a bit homesick is all when I last posted.  Being back at work is better than I thought it would be...I don't have as much time to ponder my current situation as much when I'm busy with work stuff.    I'm going to be changing the colors of my blog as soon as I get a chance...hopefully tonight.  I want them to be red and green...since I'm not into putting up backgrounds and graphics and stuff, I thought I would at least try and do the colors for Christmas...that should be fun...we all know how my past experiences with color changing this thing have gone *sigh*  This weekend we are going to a Hawaiian  themed birthday party at a friends house.  Should be fun.  We are going to try and find some hawaiian stuff this Friday so we won't look out of place not dressed up.  I think Deane wanted me to wear a bikini, but that would only scare everyone out of their grass skirts, and we don't want that :-)  Anyway--short post as I'm going to now try to do my colors :-)

        wow...where did my weekend go?   This stinks! My long weekend is over? Not fair!  On another note...Hannah peed on me tonight...gotta love stuff like that.  I do not want to go back to work.  Ugh.  On top of that I'm all depressed now.  Today someone proposed to their girlfriend at Disneyland...she said yes of course and all of us cheered for them...but after I walked off I realized "Great...another couple that probably hasn't been together as long as me and Deane, and haven't been engaged as long either, but will end up married before we do."   UGH...so I'm all pissy and grumpy tonight.  So really I don't have much to say except that I don't want to go back to work and that's pissing me off and now I'm all grumpy about marriage and that's pissing me off...so hmph.

        hmmm   OK so today I was reading  urlLink Jennies  blog and she had a link to  urlLink bookcrossing.com , it's an interesting site...I just can't bring myself to do it though...I hate giving my books away...I don't know if it's because I'm selfish, or because I like reading them more than once...but I can't even really get myself to loan books to people...weird huh?  It's a neat concept though and I like the idea.   Anywho--I'm feeling better tonight. My ear is still sore...Oh, yeah...I have what I  think  is an ear infection or something along those lines.  The whole left side of my face was all pressurized and felt like a tire was resting on it, I could hardly hear out of it this morning and kept saying "WHAT?" to people on the phone and coworkers.  Everytime I would say something, I could hear it in my head and then across the room in this echoey tinny voice...but yes...it is feeling a bit better...now I just sound like I'm in a barrel or something.  Right now I'm watching Scrubs.  They had a 40 minute episode of Friends tonight, which surprised me, I know they did it a few years ago though...I guess it's a time-filler since they haven't been able to find a successful show to fill the 9-9:30 slot in awhile...or the 8:30-9 slot...  Tomorrow me and Deane have plans to have dinner at  urlLink Mimi's Cafe  in Thousand Oaks...I think Rachael is going to babysit for us, but we haven't gotten a call from her yet, so we'll see.  Hopefully it's not too last minute for her and she can do it.   If not, Hannah can go and have fun with us :-)   Anywho--time to jam!!! Goodnight!!!

        sooo shleepy   Tonight after I made dinner, we watched School House Rocks...partly for Hannah, mostly because it's one of Deane's favorites LOL...  Today though, man, I was so sleepy...still am.  At work though, I'd be sitting there and then all of a sudden I'd start dozing off and since I sit at the receptionist desk, that's not such a good thing...I've been tired before, but not that tired...I tried everything from fresh air to caffeine...and nothing worked.  So just now Deane told me as I was falling asleep on the couch that I could go to bed if I wanted...so here I am...ready to crawl under the blankets and sleepy.  I'm thinking that maybe something is wrong with my thyroid...I think this because I have a lot of the symptoms...weight gain, exhaustion, dry skin...and some other things as well...so hopefully when I see the doctor on the 12th, she'll be able to help me figure out what's up with my body lately.    Anyway--I'm so tired that it hurts to type, so I'm going to go to bed.  Goodnight!!!

        is blogger having problems???   Does anyone else have this problem lately?  Sometimes like the last three posts I've posted will show up for a few days and then disappear...then re-appear, and then disappear...sometimes I have to go into my template and save it and then re-publish it...really strange...let me know if you know what I'm talking about and if it happens to you too???

        holiday cards in January?   Yeah, sad I know.  But yes, we're sending out our holiday pictures tonight. No cards...I opened all the cards we had sealed and took the pictures out and put them into a new envelope with a letter I typed out tonight (my best friend is Microsoft Mail Merge LOL)...and put them together to mail out.  We just had so many pictures and were so excited about mailing them out and then never did...because we were lazy really...so I sat down finally and just DID IT...they'll go out tomorrow, although I think I'm short three or four stamps...we actually had some .33 cent stamps and we put too much postage on some envelopes just to use up the old stamps we had...kind of crazy, but we don't really need 33 cent stamps that say "merry christmas" on them that have little reindeers on them either...  Anywho--Hannah is having a really rough time with the going to bed without a bottle thing.  We laid her down at 8:30, and it's 9:40 now and she's still crying and fussing. Poor thing...but we absolutely refuse to give her a bottle...no matter how tough it is.  She needs to learn to drink out of a cup, like big kids :-)  Awww poor thing...I'm gonna go see if I can help Deane settle her down.  Take care!!!

       subjects are so so so over-rated   I hate coming up with a subject for each entry...but if I don't, then it looks plain and it feels like I'm not building anything up...  ANYWAY--  Lastnight we went into the Valley to have dinner at Arby's and then decided that...well...we're here, might as well do something.  So I told Deane to just drive around since the malls were closing...so he surprised me and took me to a Miniature Golf Course in Sherman Oaks...which is hilarious actually, because the course shares a parking lot with my old company...the place I worked when we lived in Sherman Oaks...the job I hated...the one I had that made me cry everyday when I would wake up and realize I had to get ready to go there.  I hated working there, and being there lastnight brought back soooo many memories...not too many of them good.  The golfing was fun though, and the bad feeling went away instantly.  We had a blast.  There was a group of dumb kids behind us though that kept running through our hole and standing practically on top of us while we'd try to play, they'd hit their ball so hard it would come down into the area where we were playing in front of them.  At one point when they were running all of over the hole I was on I said "EXCUSE ME WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU GUYS DOING? GET OFF OUR HOLE!!!"  They of course, didn't listen...but like two holes later I guess someone else complained and the security cops came and escorted their group off the course...it was nice.  We had fun and afterwards Deane played in the batting cages and got to pretend he was A-Rod for about 5 minutes...it was fun watching him swing the bat...He had on a cute little helmet and everything.  *giggle*  That totally makes him sound like he's 8 years old...but oh well.   Today we drove out to Glendora for a birthday party.  We had a lot of fun.  I think Hannah wants a dog now.  They have a boxer named Rocky and as soon as we put Hannah down to go play, Rocky came running up to her and licked her from her chin up to her forehead...I thought it was DISGUSTING, but Hannah giggled so hard she almost fell over and then all day everytime she saw him, she'd put her face down so he could lick the top of her head...GROOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOO  SSSSSS... IHCKY!!! Dog SLOBBER!!! hehehehehe  After that we went to  urlLink Fry's Electronics  to look at digital cameras, since ours sucks and is broken after not even having it for a year.  We were looking at them and then discovered the video camera's that take digital pictures too...for only like $100 more than the camera's...so I think that's what we're going to get with our tax return...and I think we found the one we want too...I just can't find a link to one online anywhere...hmmm...interesting!!!   Hannah got tired of sitting around for us though and got fussy...we've also taken away her b-o-t-t-l-e-s as well, and she's so freaking stubborn that she refuses to drink milk out of a sippy cup...so she hasn't had hardly any milk today, just apple juice...so I think that was making her cranky...but hopefully in a few days she'll lighten up and STOP BEING SO MUCH LIKE HER DAD-----------STUUUUUUUUUUBBORN!!!  heh heh heh   OHHH I was going to write about the pranks I pulled yesterday...hmmm...ok...here's the first one...  1.)  OK...yesterday morning one of the sales people came downstairs and was sorting of making fun of me because I don't drive...so I thought...OK FINE...you'll get yours.  Right after he walked outside to take a break, one of his customers called...so I said "He's not in right now, but I'll be seeing him as he walks back in, he always stops by to tease me, so I can give him your message then if you'd like."  And the guy said "HE MAKES FUN OF YOU?"  and I said "Yes, all the time...we pick on eachother constantly."  And he said "Oh, want me to help you mess with him?" And I SAID "OF COURSE--this is what you should do...he HATES the Oakland Raiders...total Raider hater...so when he calls you back, congratulate him on the Raiders making it to the Superbowl..."  so he DID...I didn't think he'd do it, but I called the salesperson back like 20 minutes later and said "Did you call Ben back?"  "Yes!"   "Did he have anything to say to you?"  "No!"  "Are you sure?"  "No, you suck, he told me everything!"  And he hung up on me...lol lol...heh heh   OK number 2...  2.)  I work with a lady named Moe...her husband, John, calls once in awhile and if I answer the phone we kind of joke around and he's always messing with me.  So yesterday morning he called and Moe was in the restroom so I said "No, I'm sorry, I cant' put you through to her, I have a note from her on my desk that says she doesn't want to talk to you."  and he said "That's not funny, that's it...I'm reporting you."   "Who are you going to report me to?"   "MOE, I'm telling MOE on you!!!"  so I said "OK fine, I'll just tell her on you too then we'll be even."  So he hung up...which was hilarious...but not the best part.  See, he's a New York Giants fan big-time...and they didn't make it to the play-offs by like one point...heh heh heh...so when he called back that afternoon, Moe just happened to be in a training class and I said "Sorry, she's not here, she's in a training class." and he said "no, you're lying like you were earlier, let me talk to her."  I said "No, I am serious and I wanted to apologize for being such a crap-head to you earlier...it was uncalled for.  I also wanted to let you know that I wish you the best of luck this weekend when the Giants play in the Super Bowl, I hope they pull it off...."  LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG SILENCE...and then I said "OH, GOSH, OH MAN, I'm SOOO SORRY--they aren't IN the Super Bowl this year ARE THEY???"    Heh heh heh LOL it was funny.  That's when he informed me I was on his list...it was fun.    OK Goodnighties!!!

        FRIDAY!!! WOOOOOO HOO!!!   Awww...time to relax.  Any plans this weekend you ask? Hmmm...yes, actually.  Tomorrow a friend of ours is having a birthday party for his son, who's turning 2.  So we're going.  It's at the same place that we went to the Halloween party at...it's a huge house with the coolest designed yard EVER.  I loved it.    Other than that, not much else planned I don't think.  Bunch of semi-strange fairly-sad things happened this week.  My friends grandpa died on Wednesday and she called work crying and stuff...today she called back and sounded better, but we were worried about her all week...it's so sad when something like that happens.  I think she'll be fine though, she sounded pretty *positive* about it...if positive is the right word...I guess maybe saying "she sounds like she's come to terms with it" sounds more like it.  Of course she's not going to positive about it, but she's atleast found a way to look at it so that it doesn't make her too depressed.  THEN today another co-worker of mine got fired.   Kind of a cooky-crazy day.  I did get in some good practical jokes on a co-worker as well as my co-workers husband...who has since informed me that I'm on his "list"...I wasn't quite sure what the "list" was until I asked Moe and when she said "Why? How did you know about his list?" and I said "BECAUSE I'M ON IT!" and she gasped...and explained to me that the "list" means that if you're on it and he sees you walking down the street, he'll mow you down with his car LOL...***looking behind me***  It was a good joke though, and when I'm not so tired of typing, I'll tell you all about it...hehehehehehehehehe...  Anywho--have a great weekend everybody!!!

        dead animal?   YUCK! OH OK...so today I'm at lunch sitting there eating a piece of chicken and thinking "wow, this is pretty good."  THEN all of a sudden I realize "OH MY GOD...I'm eating CHICKEN...MEAT...ANIMAL...BIRD...OH MY GOD I'm going to throw up."  It's weird.  I'm in no way a vegetarian...I eat meat everyday...chicken, beef, steak...it doesn't matter...but ONCE IN AWHILE I'll be eating it, or preparing to cook it and I'll realize "Oh man, this is gross..."    Anyway--I've probably grossed everyone out now.  SOOOO ANYWAY--I went to work for a couple of hours yesterday...came home early on my lunch break...went back today though...I've decided that I dont' care.    ***(This entry has been edited due to the fact I do not want certain people reading it and reporting back to the individual mentioned)***   on it.  I mean...why should I? I don't care if she treats me like that, because that means I'm a better person and in the end when it all comes down on her head, I can't be blamed for a thing.  We call her "Jack In The Box" after those little toys that you wind up and then they spring out of the box.  It's pretty funny.     Apart from that, nothing else much going on.  I'm pretty upset that we haven't been to the gym this week, or anywhere really.  I'm starting to feel like Gwyneth Paltrow's true character in Shallow Hal...you know, the big size 24 under pants???  Yeah, that's me.     Tonight I gave Hannah her dinner...cheese ravioli.  She reeeeeeeally wants to be a big kid and so I'm letting her feed herself more and more...and I thought "Hmmm Cheese Ravioli...good for picking up..." (That's what it says on the container) So I heated it up and put some on her little tray and she did sooo good eating it...then she apparently got full and thought it would be fun to mix it up a bit...some here...some there...mostly on the front of her white shirt...in the end, she looked like someone shot her in the stomach with a tomato sauce gun.  SO I gave her a bath...and I ended up getting pretty wet.  She splashed and splashed and splashed...when Deane came in he said (of course) "She NEVER does that to me!" As I'm sitting there with water dripping off of me.   Anyway--I just copied and pasted that story into a chat window I'm having with my mom...so she'll probably read this entry and go "WHAT? I got the copy and paste routine? What's up with that?"   So I'm gonna go :-) Goodnight!!!

        mmmm Thai Food   Yes...mmmm...yummy food.  That's where we had dinner tonight, it's only about a block away, so on our way home from the grocery store we stopped and ordered take-out.  I ordered their bbq chicken and Deane got his usual, teriyaki chicken...they are both soooo good.  I really should avoid Thai Food though, it makes my stomach all messy and sore for like a whole day later.  Ugh.  I'm suffering from it right now.  Then we had some yummy  urlLink Haagen-Dazs  ice cream...Deane of course had his yummy chocolate-chocolate chip and I had a limited edition flavor, vanilla ice cream with caramel swirls and fudge brownie chunks in it. Plus, seeing as how my honey works for the world's best Chocolate company, he brought me home their newest addition the  urlLink Caramel Crunch Bar  MMMMMMM sooooo fattening I could almost FEEL myself getting fatter.   However, I'm serious about weight loss, and had to splurge one last time before I get into working out again...right? Right.  My mom found a work-out gym for women only, it's called  urlLink Curves For Women  and it's fairly cheap (less than my current gym membership is) and I'm thinking of joining it when I get the money.  That would be nice. It's 30 minutes, three nights a week...I think I could get into that, plus I might get to meet some new people in my area...and I wouldn't feel so alone in the over-weight world.  It's too bad that my online friend  urlLink Andrea  lives in the Valley, otherwise when she gets home from her snowy holiday in Austria, we could probably be work-out buddies, since she's trying to lose weight too, but neither of us have cars and the train takes too long!!! Oh, well...I guess I have to work-out with strangers *smile*      OH man my stomach is upset...this time though I don't think it's from Thai Food, I really haven't felt so great all day, since before my lunch at work.  I didn't even eat lunch, I just sat in the break room and read  urlLink People Magazine .  My stomach must just really be screwed up or something, I don't know though :-(  I didn't really eat anything yesterday either because of it.  Oh, well...the less I eat, the less weight I gain huh?  Right.    Goodnight!!!

        and then it was Sunday...   Ahhhh...so relaxed!!! We didn't do anything today!  We had been talking since Friday about going to  urlLink Davids Bridal , but never got around to it.    We've decided to go back to Nebraska in May for his brothers graduation.  It's not only exciting for him because it's a family reunion for him, but it's also a reunion for me!  All of my relatives are back there and I get to see them too!!! I'm soooo ooooo excited!!!  I got an email from my aunt tonight and she sounds excited too.  They haven't met Hannah yet, so that will be exciting.    Anyway--I'm actually not feeling so so chatty tonight...just not much going on :-)

         I'm never too sure...   OK...the  urlLink Mary-Kay  party was fun...lots.  I realized on Wednesday that lastnight was the first time in a year and a half that I've been out by myself, without Deane or Hannah there with me.   It was a bit awkward at first, I wasn't sure what to do with my hands, I didn't have Deane to hug or Hannah's stroller to push, so I felt...naked :-) The lady that invited me, or my "consultant", is a co-worker of mine and she picked out the colors for us after we filled out a questionaire...she picked it out perfectly, all the colors she picked out for me, Moe and Rachael fit us so well and looked so natural on us that we were all so impressed!!!  Fun!    I've been thinking about this for a few weeks now...and I've toned down the "I hate myself" thought to just a "I don't like myself" way of thinking...but then I thought...you know, if you don't like yourself, do something about it...so I've made a list of all the things I hate..er...I mean, dis-like about myself, and then a list of ways that I can help change it.  Here's my lists...   Dislikes  1.  The way I dress (I dress like a man) 2.  I'm fat  3.  My hair looks like a used floor mop 4.  I can't afford to wear make-up 5.  I'm fat    How I can change it  1.  Try not to be so self-conscience, dare to try more feminine things, after all, I AM a girl *smile*  2.  Start going to the gym again (Last year when we were working out everyday, I lost 15 lbs.) 3.  Get a haircut, a new style and maybe some highlights 4.  Break down and buy the $300 set of make-up and skin care from Mary-Kay and then I wouldn't have to spend that much ever again, I just replace it as I run out. 5.  Stop eating at In N Out Burger, go back to the gym, work out, and keep at it  Anywho--We tried Hannah going to bed without a bottle tonight, and I'm sure the neighbors would agree with us that it's not working so well...she's howling and sobbing and being all dramatic about it.  Maybe cold-turkey isn't the way to go...awww...but maybe it is...it's quiet in there now...hmmmm....OH CRIPES there she goes...OK I'm going...

        cleaning...   I doubt that I've ever cleaned quite so much in such a little amount of time...lastnight I did the living room and Hannah's room, and tonight I cleaned the kitchen after I made dinner...it started out that I was merely going to wash the dinner utensils because the casserole I made makes a huge mess...but then I thought...why not a clean a little more? Pretty soon I had the lysol out and the sponges and the stove was all sparkly and clean and then the counters started to look white again (OK They weren't toooo messy to begin with, but it looked bad)  and now I'm resting...tomorrow I think I'll take the night off...oh, wait...the bedroom needs cleaned too...oh well...  Thursday night I'm going to a Mary-Kay party...I think I went to one once a looong time ago with my best friend and my mom...but I don't know if that was a Mary-Kay party or just a mother-daughter-make-over-party...maybe both...anyway--a coworker of mine is wanting to do it full-time (shhhhh....) and so me and Moe are going over to her house to let her make us over and play around with make-up stuff...I think it would maybe be a good time to replace the make-up I have too...if it's not too expensive.  We'll see, it would be nice to have a new set of make-up though, mine is looking pretty ragged.  Hannah was a bit of a grouch-o tonight...she fussed all the way home from daycare, threw a tantrum when we got home, didn't calm down during her time-out and didn't eat hardly any dinner...so Deane bathed her and we put her right to bed at like 8:30...she's definetly an interesting baby when she gets mad.  Her teacher told us today that the kids that don't get "finger foods" for lunch steal the kids lunches that DO get "finger foods" like sandwiches and crackers...I send her to school with  urlLink  Gerber Microwavable Meals .  She likes those and it guarantees her a hot meal during the day...but apparently she'd rather eat a jelly sandwich...so tonight when I made her lunch I made her a little jelly sandwich, goldfish crackers and some bananas...I also packed the microwavable meal in case she decides mommy's sandwiches don't taste as good as the other kids' sandwiches do.   Anyway--goodnight everyone! My arms are sooo sore from all the scrubbing I did tonight!!!  Deane isn't feeling well either, so I think I'll go take care of him.   We're lying in bed watching  urlLink Oceans Eleven ...ok...so I WILL be lying in bed watching it in like 5 minutes...  Goodnight!!!

        monday? already?   Wasn't yesterday Friday??? HUH? What happened to the weekend???  UGH UGH UGH!!!  We had a fantastic weekend...Friday night hmm...gosh, I can't remember Friday night, but Saturday we lounged around and napped, then went and saw  urlLink Two Weeks Notice  and had dinner at  urlLink BJ's .  It was soooo nice, we were both talking about how relaxed it was, when usually our nights out alone seem kind of rushed and a little awkward...like we've forgotten how to be alone in public together lol.    Yesterday we ended up down at Disneyland again...don't know how really, one minute we were coming up with things to do on Sunday, and the next minute we were in line for the entrance...we got home around 10:30 lastnight and went RIGHT TO BED we were sooooo sleepy!!!  Then...it happened...Monday morning came...UGH and here we are...  Tonight we went to Target to buy...*drum roll* DIAPERS!  Then got Burger King for dinner because our kitchen was a mess and Deane didn't feel like making dinner, besides, we were STAAAAAARVING!!!  When we got home we cleaned our living room, Hannah's room and the kitchen...engineers are coming on Thursday/Friday to inspect the units here in our complex and I don't want them to see how messy we get :-)  *Fingers Crossed* That they don't turn us in for having two cats...*cringe* Ooops *shrug*   Anyway--my legs are kind of twitchy tonight...I'm gonna go!!!  Nighties!!!

       hmmm...what to say?   Ever been at a loss for words? I haven't been able to think of anything to write in here...I can't believe it's been since Monday...what a long week...it feels like it took years and years to get to Friday. UGH...It's always the week after New Year's that sucks big.   I can't even remember what we did this week...I think at one point we went to the mall?  I don't know.  Deane found out today that they are building a mall here...in Simi Valley.  Something we don't need...and that I don't even really think anybody wants. OH, well.  I like the feel of Simi, it feels small and it feels quiet...I'm afraid that if they build a mall it won't feel like that anymore...I like the idea of having to drive more than 5 or 6 miles to get to the nearest mall, in a whole other town...I like that.    Tomorrow we're not doing much I don't think...probably just cleaning up the place...then tomorrow night we're leaving Hannah with some friends and are going to go out to dinner together.  I can't wait.  He got off of work early today and came over to where I work and I took my 15 min. break and we went for a walk together around the building...we held hands and talked and everything...we didn't have to tell Hannah to stop grabbing stuff or worry about her eating stuff or crying or doing anything strange :-)   Anyway, short entry...I'm just short of speechless...have a great weekend!!!

        new foods...try them or no?   OK so I'm into trying new foods...if it sounds good.  So far in the last 4 months I've been introduced to Biscuits and Gravy, which is delicious...and today I tried Chicken and Dumplings...really good as well...Deane however...is a definete no on the new foods thing.  I always ask...just in case, I mean, you never know when he might decide to try something and I'd feel bad for not asking...but he always says no.    Anyway--we got another Christmas package today.  From his Florida college days...I've never met this friend, but we talk on the phone a lot and I like him so much, he's so funny and a great guy.  Anywho, he sent us The Producers on DVD...and some silly bumper stickers for a tourist attraction in South Carolina (I think it's sort of an inside joke between him and Deane from when they went on their road trip together...because I don't get it) so I think Deane is watching The Producers and I'm trying trying trying to find out where I can buy some Hansen's Dailies...they only seem to have it on the catering truck that comes to work everyday, which seems silly to me...but I'm going to write them a letter and find out where I can find some in the stores, as they are too expensive to buy everyday off the truck.    I had my review today at work...it went ok...I'm meeting all standards.  So that felt good.  She thinks I have a lot of potential for growth there too, so that was exciting...I love sitting at the front desk, but eventually would like to move on to other projects.  I like working there.  OH and this morning I figured out my only source of unhappiness...are you ready for this???      GETTING OUT OF BED...  Didn't see that coming didja?  I dont' mind waking up...I'm ok with that part...it's actually getting up that sucks.  Not just Monday-Friday...but 7 days a week I hate doing this...it's such a bother.  Plus you're all cozy and warm snuggled under the blankets...why ruin it by getting up???  Huh? I don't get it.  Everything should be accessible from bed.  Just an idea...  We decided to meet his friends at Chili's tonight...at 10:30.  I guess they used to do this every Tuesday night, but then we had Hannah and couldn't stay out late, so we stopped going, but tonight we decided to take her out with us and see his friends.  We haven't been to Chili's Night since last May or June...so it'll be good to see his friends again.  Such a late night though...  Anyway--I'm off to change out of my work clothes and spend time with Deane and Hannah...as soon as I got home I got online, so I should go spend time with them :-)  Take care everyone!!!

        saturday...   OK So woohoo for me! This day was MUCH better than last Saturday...this day didn't make me want to die.  Although yesterday I was so siiiiiick I thought I just might die.  I went to bed at 7p.m. and slept all night until 9a.m...and still had a bit of a stomach ache when I woke up...I don't know what it was from.  Luckily I am in a relationship with the world's greatest man and he took care of me and Hannah lastnight so I could rest and get better.  I woke up briefly at 11 and he doted on me and made sure I had everything I needed before I went back to bed...whatta sweetie!    I hope everyone had a good, safe, fun New Years.  We did.  It was nice.  At the last minute we decided to go to Newport Beach...one of our favorite places.  It was a quiet evening, we walked along the harbor and looked at all the million dollar homes for sale and made plans for when we bought one *smile*  I would definetly never had a tree in my front window that looks out over the harbor...that's just crazy...nor would I have those small little windows either...I'd have a huuuuuuuuuge-mongous window in my living room...but that's just me!   We left Newport Beach right after midnight and thought we'd see a bunch of cops pulling people over on the 5 Freeway, but the only ones we saw were right in Newport Beach and the 5 Freeway was completely open and there weren't any accidents or pull-over's anywhere...interesting.  Although I heard of a bunch of bad bad accidents in Seattle where my parents live and over by Kettle Falls, where I grew up...but that's sort of expected...the roads up there in Kettle Falls are so icy and snowy and windy and that's always a bad combo, but on New Years it's almost asking for a bad wreck somewhere...still sad though...luckily this time it was nobody I know.  Today we went to Eggs N Things for breakfast...it was soooo good.  Normally when I go there, I get the denver omelette, but today I got the steak and cheese with mushroom omelette...it was sooo good...although, from being sick the last couple of days, my stomach has shrunk from me not eating anything, so I could only eat less than half of it...but it was still good...then we walked outside and realized what a delicious day it was and wanted to do something special...so we went to Disneyland.  Sort of a last minute decision and we didn't get there until 4...but we had fun, it wasn't crowded so I didn't go Nazi on anyone and started freaking out on people for stopping in the middle of walkways or just being stupid in general.   OOOH weird funny story...today on the freeway we were talking about a Seinfeld episode where Elaine is dating a guy that looooooooooves the song "Desperado"  and she tries to switch him over to the song "Witchie Woman"  OK...now we've never listened to this song together, nor have we ever talked about it, or talked about this episode...but as we're talking about it, Deane goes "OH my GOD...look at that license plate on that car over there!!!" So I glance over and it's "WICHI WM"   Weird eh?  Coincedence?  Hmmm...Strange? YES...it made my fingers all tingly.  Next weekend, some friends are going to watch Hannah for us so that we can use the gift certificate they got us at  urlLink BJ's .  We've never eaten there, but are really looking forward to it!  Maybe we can see a movie too...I'd like to see  urlLink Two Weeks Notice  with Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant, someone at work said it was a good movie.  Anywho--I'm off to bed.  I came in here to make the bed, and ended up getting online, and Deane made the bed...so I feel a tab bit bad about that.    Goodnight!!!

        I'm so glad it's the weekend   Man, this morning at like 10:30, I'm sitting at work thinking "GOOD MOTHER OF GOD, is Friday EVER going to end??? It has to be like 4 pm. right?"  WRONG! Try only 10:30...not even late enough to take lunch...ugh.  FINALLY 5:30 got there and I bolted out of there like a mad man.    Tonight we went shopping at  urlLink Costco ...we got Hannah an outfit there, it's really cute, we thought it was a t-shirt and shorts, but when we got to the check-out realized it was *gag* a skort...but we got it anyway because it's cute.  Besides, we can always buy denim shorts to match it...  My wrist has been bothering me a LOT today and yesterday.  It's right at the joint, and if I move my wrist wrong or snap it or something, a sharp pain shoots right through my wrist and hurts to no end.    I don't know why all my paragraphs are one-liners tonight...maybe I'm boring...  Hmmm..............................................OH my new favorite Ice Cream... urlLink Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake Ice Cream  oh boy, it's soooo damn good it should be a crime.  Wow.  It has chunks of chocolate cheesecake in it and oh...so good.  Ugh.    Me and my friend Moe were discussing crazy dumb things we did in High School, and it made me laugh...made me a bit homesick for the old days too...I have fun now, don't get me wrong...but it's on a more mature level...and I miss being an immature 17 year old with my two best friends...*sigh*  I'm sure they both remember the night they had me cornered in Anne's kitchen and had John D. pin me down and my two choices were to either kiss John or eat cat food...I know that I did neither of the two and somehow managed to get up and hide behind the door of the refrigerator until they let up.  Hmmm...then there was the night they came out to pick me up and we had a bag of Oregano and tried to convince my mom it was marijuana and that we had bought it from someone we met at the gas station and wanted her to get stoned with us...heh...she took a whiff of it and said "I don't know who you bought it from, or how much you paid for it, but you got ripped off, that's oregano..."  LOL...really funny.  I guess you had to be there...*ahem*   Anyway--goodnighties!!!

       ya ya...   I don't even remember what I wanted to post about tonight...hmmm...  I decided today at work that I would start planning Hannah's birthday party...I mean, not like planning planning...but coming up with ideas and stuff like that.  So I was looking through the  urlLink Oriental Trading Company's  catalog and they had some cute party supplies and ideas...hmmm...I started an excel spreadsheet with game ideas and stuff.  I'm really interested in the  urlLink Smiley Face  theme...  The blood tests I have on Saturday are to see if my weight-gain has anything to do with my thyroid...I am terrified of needles though and am a little freaked out that this will be the second time in a month that I've been poked by needles...ugh.    Other than that, I can't remember what I was planning on posting here...ugh.  Deane and Hannah went over to Frank and Christy's house for dinner tonight.  I wasn't feeling so well...so I skipped it.   Anyway--goodnight!

        blogger...   I haven't been able to get into my blog or into blogger all weekend! I tried coming on to post Friday but it wouldnt' let me and then all weekend it was like that too!!!  Work went fine...everything worked out.  I had a pain in my chest all morning though and it was hard to breathe until I found out it was ok and that I wasn't being blamed.   Anyway, last weekend was so great.  We went to the tar pits and looked around the museum they have there, watched a little film on the history and stuff...afterwards we didn't really feel like driving home, so we drove through Beverly Hills and Santa Monica up to PCH and up the ocean to home.    Sunday was relaxing. It was overcast and chilly all day, so we stayed home until late afternoon, then we took Hannah to the park and let her run around to get some steam out.   We don't really have plans this weekend either.  I have to have some blood-tests on Saturday morning, but after that I think our weekend is open. I'm not sure what I would like to do either.    I talked to my best friend Jean Sunday night too! We hadn't talked in months and I called because I missed her!!! She promised to try and stay in touch more and so did I.  I don't know what I'd do if we ever fell out of touch with eachother!!!  She's planning on moving to Vancouver to live with a friend of ours from high school...I teased her and told her that they'd be dating soon after and she told me something interesting...SEE...in High School I had a crush on this guy, Ryan, and apparently he had a crush on me...but we didn't know about the other one liking the other...until after that crush thing was over and we had just become really good friends...but I guess our friends thought we'd been "messing around" together since they all knew we liked eachother.  How embarrassing!!!  Ugh!!!  LOL  Anyway--it's super cold here tonight...right now it's like 53, but it's been cold and rainy all day ... and my hands and feet are sooooooo cold...I have to go find socks to put on and maybe some sweats...goodnight!!!

       wow, this week is going by faaaaaaast   OK...I might get fired tomorrow...or atleast written up.  I'm terrified...sick to my stomach...it hurts to breath.  I finish a report today for my boss and when I saved it and then emailed it back to her, she opened it and all the data was gone.  I realize this is not my fault and most people would say "that's not your fault...you saved it..."  yeah, but you don't know her.  UGH...I hate feeling like this.   ANYWAY--yes, this week IS going by waaaay fast...although I was a bit disappointed when I realized this morning that it was only Thursday and not Friday.  Deane and I decided that we are going to go to the  urlLink La Brea Tar Pits ...(it's the place in the movie "My Girl 2" where the kid pretends to throw her ring in the tar? Yeah, that place)...I've never been there and Deane hasn't been there since he was little...so we're taking  Hannah.  I told him to invite his  friend Melanie, whom I've never met, but he won't...so I have a feeling he may not want me to meet her...*smile* (I hope he reads this...I'll be in so much trouble LOL)    EWWWW I'm watching CSI and they just found a dead guy in a cave or mine with bugs all over his gun shot wound...YUUUUUCK...earlier they pulled a stake out of someone's head and showed the hole it left...*gag*   OOOH gotta go...Deane's here :-)

        weekend...over? soooo soon?   OK our weekend was sooooo excellent.  We stayed  urlLink here .  And ate dinner  urlLink here ...Saturday morning and Saturday afternoon we hung out in  urlLink Newport Beach ...then on Sunday we came home. It was so nice and so relaxing.  Hannah was sort of unsettled being away from home, and threw a few fits, but oh well.  Life huh?   I was so tired from the weekend that lastnight when I got home from work, I went right to bed and slept from 7:15 until my alarm went off this morning.  Tonight Deane went to  urlLink Chili's  to meet up with some of his friends, and as soon as he left Hannah decided she wanted to go and has been crying and throwing a fit for 30 minutes...*sigh*  I finally laid her down and am just letting her cry for a bit while I relax and catch my breath.  It's really tiring me out, these fits she's throwing...but I think she's starting to settle down and get tired.  I hope so.  *Fingers crossed*    I hope everyone else had good weekends!!!  I've been reading a few blogs and it sounds like it!!!  Goodnight!!!

        no peekie peekie!!!   I did SUCH a good job this morning...I could've totally blown Deane's surprise weekend for me by looking on the computer at the history files and stuff, but I BEHAVED and deleted all of them and didn't look at anything...so I still have nooo idea what we're doing or where we're going.  He's excited about it though, and keeps giving me more hints than my usual "one a day."  So far I know it's within a few hours driving distance from here...it's somewhere we've never been together...and where we're staying is 4 stars...plus we're staying Friday AND Saturday night and have dinner reservations on Sunday at 4 p.m. for somewhere...hmmm...  He decided he'll tell me Friday morning instead of making me wait until we're on our way...  Tomorrow night I'm going to go shopping at  urlLink Target  with Moe...I need to get some stuff for this weekends trip and then I think we'll go to  urlLink Ross  to see if I can find some new outfits since they're pretty inexpensive there.  I'm sooo excited about this weekend.  This morning I had a doctor's appt. and they did their usual exam and stuff and then I mentioned I'm worried about the weight gain I've experienced, so tomorrow after work I have to go to the lab and have some blood tests done to see if it's my thyroid...so me and Moe switched schedules, which means I'll be there at 7 a.m. so I can get off work at 4 before the lab closes and then be home when Moe gets off work and comes to get me.    It's been raining non-stop since lastnight...so when I went to the doctors this morning and had to walk 3 blocks in the rain, I got pretty wet...not as wet as after the appt. when the wind was blowing and the rain was coming down in all different directions...plus I stepped in a puddle of water that went up to my ankle...needless to say, when I got to work, I was not a happy camper...ugh.  I didn't have time to come home first though and change out of my wet shoes, so I had gross wet feet all day...that can't be good can it??? I didn't think so.    Anyway--I should get going...Hannah is out in the living room with Deane and I can hear her screaming...which means she's been climbing on something and he told her no...ugh...here comes the tantrum...*sigh*

        woo-hoo!   Doctors appt! Tomorrow! Woo-Hoo!!! Gives me time to sleepy in :-)  Plus I don't have to be at work until 1:30! WOO-HOO!!! I couldn't be more excited.  Anyway...gosh, I just really don't have anything to say on this blog thing anymore...*sigh*  Deane is up to no good :-) Actually, he's planning a secret for Valentine's Day...I'm excited...he was in here all sneaky-like earlier and told me not to go through any "history" or "temp files" on the computer...hehehehe...  Hmmm...OH, Hannah is doing much better. Deane took her to the doctor yesterday because she was having a bad day at daycare...and the dr. looked at her and said she didn't have any infections or anything, but that maybe she had fluid in her ear from a cold she'd had...so he gave us some ear drops to put in there and see if that would work.  It seems to be doing better.  Tonight she went to bed at 9:30 and at 10:30 I heard her turn her light on and start banging her crib against the wall...so she's awake...and her and Deane are "stalking" me right now...I should go...they think they're sooooo clever...I'll show them!!!

You have to be a member...so please...join :-)  Friends and family are welcome.    Anyway--it's late.  I have a bunch to post, but I'll have to do it tomorrow...I'm so tired from working on the photo album, that I'll have to rest and start again tomorrow :-)  goodnight!!!

        friends   Have you ever had a friend that you've never met in person, only talked to on the phone a few times, and usually only just talk a few times every couple of weeks, or even months? Hmm?  Like a pen pal?  You trust this person with secrets, you trust this person with your deepest inner-most feelings...because, well...he's your friend right?  Good. I'm glad I'm not the only one.  Seven years ago, when I first started using the internet, I met my friend Todd online.  He's from Texas, and that was my big thing in high school...Texas...loved it...so when he started chatting with me I was so excited LOL...his friend (at the time) was totally trying to get with my friend...and when that didn't happen, it was just me and Todd...chatting away :-)  I think I had actually started chatting with Todd first, and one night his friend messaged me to bug me about Jean...but anyway...his friend has nothing to do with it.   I dont' even know why I"m writing this.  People that don't understand won't believe me.  He's one of the nicest people I've ever met...or not met...or ... whatever.  I found out he reads this blog once in awhile too ... so maybe this is just some shameless act of sucking up LOL :-)))  heh heh heh  This last week has been buuuuuuuuuuusy...or not so.  I don't know.  Between being sick and being sick of my job, I haven't had much time for anything. Oh, on Saturday though, we did spend 12 looooooooooooooooooong hours at Disneyland with his neice, Katie.  Since we have annual passes, when we go there, we normally don't spend more than 4 or 5 hours there...since we can always come back later.  But Katie only gets there like once a year, so we had to get in two or three rides on all the big rides before we could go home, and as tired and ragged as she was, she wanted to stay...*sigh*    Monday I stayed home sick. Couldn't hear out my ears...thought I was dying...lol.  Got a little pi$$ed off when the doctors office couldn't see me on such short notice. Whatever.  I'm feeling better now though...lotsa sudafed and I feel soooo much better now.    We went out to Target tonight and bought a new toilet seat lol...the old one was a cheap-o one our apartment manager put on before we moved in, it had plastic hinges and plastic screws and finally broke to pieces...so we replaced it with a metal hinged one, and I told Deane we were taking it with us when we move out LOL...  Anywho--enough toilet talk.  Goodnight everyone (Hi Todd ***WAVE***)

        urlLink Wednesday Wish     If you were not named what you are, what name would you wish to have? Do you think things would be different if you had that name? How?   Hmmm...well over the years I've changed my mind on this a lot.  I used to want to be a Mary-Anne...then I wanted to not necessarily change my name, but go by my first and middle name...Sarah-Jane instead of Sarah...(when I met Deane, I told Sarah-Jane was my name)...but over the last 4 or 5 years I've really liked the name "McKenna"...and think that I would change my name to that if I ever had to change it...It would change my life completely because if I'd had a different name 6 years ago though, I wouldn't have ever met Deane...he was looking for an old friend of his named "Sarah" and that's how he found me on ICQ...So yes, it would change my life quite a bit if I'd been born "McKenna" instead of Sarah.   I don't think I would change my name though.  I think about how much I like that name, but I like Sarah-Jane a  LOT  more.  It's sort of a "family" name and I'm very proud of it...plus I think Sarah is a beautiful name *-)    Tomorrow we leave for our trip! More like in a few hours we'll leave...ugh  is there REALLY a 3:30 a.m.??? UGGGGGGH...it'll be worth it though.  I was on the phone with my dad tonight and we were saying goodbye and he said "Goodnight Sarah, I'll see you tomorrow!"  And I said "YEAH YOU WILL!" and he said  "....WOW...it feels soooo good to say that."    I haven't seen him since February of 2002...I REALLY miss him and really need a hug from him *sniffle*  He has to work this weekend, but hopefully I'll get to spend some time with him.    Goodnight!!! See you when I get back!!!

         ***BUGELS SOUNDING***   I don't know why...I just think it would be cool to have that playing everytime someone comes to my blog...the "Chaaaaaaaarge!" duh duhda dum da dum...or something like that.    *ahem*  This week is going to be soooooooooooooooo sloooooooooooooooooooooooow...I need to find entertaining ways to keep myself occupied...Today I think I may have actually dozed off at work for about 20 seconds...not good of course. Then I told someone that Thursday was my last day of work and he thought I meant I was quitting...so OF COURSE I had to roll with that and tell him that I hated living here and was moving back to Seattle...he couldn't believe it and kept asking me why I would do that, so finally Moe and I started laughing and couldn't keep torturing him any longer...too fun.  I'm sure there will be more of that as the week drags by...I know it's mean, but I HAVE TO OCCUPY MY BRAIN WITH MORE THAN JUST THOUGHTS OF MY TRIP OR ELSE I'LL GO INSANE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored   Deane had a flat tire today...I discovered that we don't have flat-tire-fixing-tools of any kind, so he stayed home from work and is now waiting for his brother to come help him.  Should be a long night...hmmm...  Hannah said "Cookie" today...that's a new word.  Plus she walks around waving and saying "HI" to everyone...even if it's for the 30th time in a row.  She's pretty funny.  SHE ALSO almost did a face-dive off of our couch...which is an on-going battle with me and her...she climbs up there, I explain to her it's a death-trap for someone with short legs, and put her back on the floor...she climbs back up and laughs and the routine starts over...*sigh* so tonight when I grabbed her centimeters before she hit her head, I said "NO MORE PLAYING ON THE COUCH AND THIS TIME I'M DEAD SERIOUS!!!"  I think after I'm done writing in this thing, I'm going to upload some new pictures to our  urlLink MSN Community .  We have some good ones from the past couple weeks that I want to show you guys.   I think I might also try to figure out how to decorate the welcome page...it'll kill me some time before Friday right???  OK HANNAH HAS THE MOUSE AND IS CLICKING STUFF...GOODNIGHT!!

        off to the beach!   Today we went to our favorite beach...I did a search for it on the internet thinking "Yeah RIGHT, you'll never find a link to it, it's too small of a beach..."  but it looks like someone else loves it as much as we do...here is a link to a photographers website, I linked it directly to the pictures of  urlLink Sycamore Cove ...totally beautiful. The photographs are at the bottom of the webpage...she has links to them...they're so awesome...I sent her an email telling her I liked her photo's and that I linked to her page :-)  We were talking about it today and I think we  might  have found a ..................  wedding location ...***LOUD BELLS CHIMING*****PEOPLE CLAPPING*****WHISTLES CAN BE HEARD IN BACKGROUND***...we just have to look into it a little more and figure out where we could have our reception that wouldn't cause our guests to drive to far to get there...since the beach is kind of far away from any place with good restaurants or reception locations...we'll see.  We dont' even have a wedding date yet.    We used our video camera today too! It's funny, we were watching the tape tonight and the footage of me two nights ago at the park didn't make me gag or puke or want to kill myself, but then today's footage had me totally doing all of those things...I actually said "Wow, I think I've gained 20 lbs. just since THURSDAY!" Of course I haven't, but that's what I looked like!!!    Anywho--  Hannah is in the bath! That means it's almost time for her bedtime! WOO HOO!!! Her fever seems to be getting better.  We didn't go to the candle party, and were a little hesitant to go to the beach, but figured that atleast if she had a fit at the beach, nobody would really notice, whereas if we were in someone's apartment with a bunch of adults and more kids, Hannah's fit would be heard to kingdom come...so we dragged her to the beach and she had fun.  I think the fresh air really helped her.  Last weekend it rained and so she didn't get out much, and I know she goes outside a lot at daycare, but I think it's different for her to go out and play with Mommy and Daddy...she likes it a lot when we take her out to the little play yard here at the complex, and she also likes to just walk around the trails leading through the complex...  Anyway--I think I have little grains of sand all over me...Hannah was throwing it (of course) and the wind I'm sure was blowing it around, so I feel all itchy and should go wash up and change out of my beachy clothes...I need to wash the pants I wore today anyway, since they're about 2 sizes too big and I'm going to return them to the store tomorrow...LAST WEEK when I bought them, they fit fine, or so I thought...but now they fall down and in the video all you see is me hiking up my pants...how attractive...NOT...back to the store!!!!  It'll be the first time in a long time I've bought pants that were too big...usually it's the other way around...hmmm...I doubt that means I'm losing weight...most likely just really bad at judging how a pair of pants fit in a dressing room...  Goodnight...

         ***singing*** "IT'S FINALLY FRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDAY"  ***singing***   WoW this was a looooooooooooooong week huh? Wow.  *sigh of relief*  I'm glad it's over.   My mom was trying to get me to change our trip up there until after the war!!!??? I can't...it's next weekend or I won't be able to have time off until Thanksgiving *gasp*...my company is about to initiate a whole new software program and for the next two or three months we'll be in heavy training and stuff...so they've blacked out holiday and vacation time until it's over.  I'm not afraid to fly anyway, and I dont' think Deane is either.  Someone on the news made a very good point tonight "Terrorists try to find the weak spots in a country and then they attack it."  Well...after 9/11, I'm sure the least weak part of us is our airline security...so I think we're safe enough.    I'm watching  urlLink "The Stranger Beside Me" , the Ted Bundy Story...I've read the book... urlLink Ann Rule  is my favorite author and I've read almost all her books...she was actually good friends with Bundy before he began his murder spree...the book is excellent, but as usual, the movie isn't up to par and I'm only half interested in it.  We're recording it though, just to have.  That's one weird thing about me, I'm a very normal person, but I love true crime stories and reading about people like Bundy and  urlLink Randy Woodfield ...also an Ann Rule topic...  does that make me weird?  I am just very interested in why they did the things they did, like what made them feel like brutally attacking and murdering women was a good type of revenge to the women in college that broke up with them...what's up with that anyway???  If I killed everybody that made me mad...nevermind...that's not constructive thought...  We don't have any plans so far this weekend.  I've been invited to a candle party tomorrow, but depending on how Hannah feels I'm not sure if we're going.  She's been running hot and cold attitude wise, and our friends that invited us already have three kids, so I don't want to take Hannah over there, have her be in a rotten mood and then set off the other kids...so we'll see how she feels tomorrow afternoon when it gets time to get ready to go.  I'd hate to not go, but I'm not going to subject other people to Hannah's nastiness...  Anyway--Hannah's in bed now, so I'm gonna go spend time with Deane I think...if he'll let me.

       h e l l o o o o o o o o . . . . . . . . . . .    Guess what??? I'm AAAAAAALIVE!!!  Just been sorta crazy-around here.  Hannah is getting like a hundred new teeth all at the same time and has been extremely hard to get along with...  I went to my first NHL game on Tuesday night...it was great. The  urlLink Kings  got beat pretty bad...but it was still fun, and I'm a bit of a fan now, although I don't think I can watch it on TV...I still have a hard time figuring out what's going on, and keeping track of the puk is tough (Although I mentioned that on Wednesday and said "But I kept track of the fights!" and someone was kind enough to point out, that the fights took place right over the puk...so I guess I knew where it was all along!!!)  I went with my friend Moe, and about 15 co-workers...although my other coworkers didn't sit with us (we had better seats...mmmmmm) and afterwards one of our coworkers who's a hockey player in a local league, got to play on the ice at Staples Center (where the game was) It was pretty cool...  Last weekend we went out and saw  urlLink Adaptation ...in the rain LOL...it poured, we had thunder and lightening and all that good stuff!!!  We had dinner at  urlLink Red Robin , I wasn't very impressed with the chicken ensenada plate that I ordered...they're always trying "new" dishes, and I am a sucker for that and end up being disappointed... I need to remember to stick with my favorite...the Sour Cream Ranch Chicken burger...mmmmmm with bottomless fries...sooooooo good.  Hannah stayed with our sitter, and on our way home in the storm, listening to the thunder, I kept thinking we'd come home and they'd be sitting in the middle of a power outage with no flashlight.  They were all ok though when we got home.    This week has just been hectic with Hannah and work and getting ready for our trip next week...I'm really getting restless and ready to go...plus on top of that, we just started our war with Iraq and that's been hard to think of nice things to write about with it all going on...I finally had to put in a movie to get away from all the news...I did the same thing with 9/11...I can only handle so much drama and depressing stuff.  Anyway--gotta go, dinner is ready! MMMMMMM Chicken casserole!!!

       video cameras...fantasy baseball...   My friend Todd, who I previously mentioned...whom I love dearly...trash talked me all last season because I'm a Mariners fan and he's a *GAG* Rangers fan...so this year he invited me to join fantasy baseball, I've never played, but figured it would be a good way to get him back and whoop his butt at baseball...I just looked at our teams from the draft and that stinker Todd managed to get Edgar Martinez...ONLY MY FAVORITE PLAYER...I would kill to get him on my team...I guess I'll have to bake Todd cookies or something...hmmm...  ANYWAY...two of my friends have told me they're going to come up and see me while I'm in Seattle...YAY!!! I can't wait. I hope more of them decide to show up...  Today the video camera saga continued...we woke up this morning to check the status of our order with Costco and in nice big black letters it said   CANCELLED  ...hmmm why you ask?  Because Bank of America saw that we'd made two other fairly large purchases that day, and I think Debit/Visa/Check cards through BofA have a $500 limit a day on them...so it rejected the sale and so Costco cancelled our order.  NO PROBLEM THOUGH...we called Costco and they tracked down the video camera we tried to buy yesterday, only they didn't have it in stock...but today they found one at another Costco...in Los Feliz...so we said "PLEASE HOLD IT THERE FOR US WE'RE ON OUR WAY!!!" So we went and picked it up.  urlLink This is the one  we picked out...it's different from the one we tried buying yesterday, and it's much nicer...and no...we did not spend $1,000.00 on it...so put your tongue back in your mouth...there's no way we'd spend that much...  After the camera thing got taken care of, we took Hannah to the  urlLink  zoo .  We ended up buying a yearly membership there, just so we wouldn't have to stand in the hour-long ticket line...it's not bad though...and we like the zoo...it's a good alternative to Disneyland :-)  I'm a little sore tonight though.  The zoo is built on a hill...so we got plenty of exercise...on top of the exercises I do in the morning...my stomach muscles are mighty sore today.  I've been searching the internet for fat-burning exercises that take less than 20 minutes a day that I can do before or after the gym...and I found  urlLink this .  I of course don't know if it will work or not, seeing as how I need to actually apply myself to doing it...but I've been doing good with the other little exercises, and I've cut out most of the junk food and soda that I used to eat...I can't cut all of it out though...but most of it is a good start right? Right.  I got a letter from my doctor today saying that A) I don't have cancer and B) My blood tests all came back normal which means I dont' have a thyroid problem...which means my weight gain is completely my fault and I'm the only one that can do anything about it.  I was sort of hoping for some weird hormonal problem or something...to take the easy way out...but whatever...guess I'll have to work for it huh?

         wow...   I don't think the new colors on my blog look as good as I thought they would when I pictured it in my head...it makes me feel like I just walked into a vomitorium or something...I'll have to look at my color guide and think of a new color scheme.  Anyway--I was glad to hear people still check in on my blog even though I don't post as often (mostly because blogger's been strange lately...but that seems to be fixed...)   We went into Costco tonight and bought a video camera, but when we went to pick it up, they didn't have any in stock, so we were refunded our money, which was better because it was more expensive than the one we wanted, and we ended up finding the same one for cheaper on their website...so that worked out really well, and saved us $100.00.   urlLink This is the one   we picked out.  I finally told him "Look, I'm putting my foot down...we have to find a camera and stick to it...I can't handle the constant shopping and changing of our minds...let's just decide tonight..."  He agreed...so we did...heh heh heh...funny how that works.    I was talking to someone at work and she gave me a good exercise to do that would help shape up my stomach a bit, so I've been doing for the last two or three days (when Deane isn't looking...I think I'd be embarrassed to do it in front of him) and have started to doubt that it's working on my stomach as it should be, but earlier I was playing with Hannah on the floor and went to lay back on my back and felt the pull in my stomach muscles...so that must mean it's working! So we'll see how that works together with the exercise at the gym...but I'm sore...UGH...but that's a good thing...but UGH anyway...LOL  Today we got Hannah's little bed.  It wasn't a whole toddler "set" like we thought...it's just a bed and mattress, and we found out when we got it home that the mattress is the same size as her crib mattress...I thought so, when they first told us they had a bed for her...I knew that crib mattresses are usually designed to fit toddler beds as well, so you don't have to buy a new one after 3 years...but whatever.  We set it up in her room and at first she was really upset about it...which is funny, because she's still sleeping in her crib for awhile...but just looking at the bed made her go into hysterics for awhile...tonight though when we got home from dinner, she ran into her bedroom and climbed up on the bed and laid down.  I think what helped was after she ran from the bedroom to hide from the bed today, I made it up with some of her blankets and put stuffed animals on it for decoration...plus she'll have time to get used to it, since she's still going to be in her crib for atleast another year...so we'll see :-)   I completely rearranged her room today and cleaned out the messy closet and got together a huge box of my clothes and Hannah's clothes that we don't wear anymore and are going to give away to Goodwill...someday :-)    We were planning on going to a Whale Festival tomorrow...this whale season is supposed to be huge for migrating whales along the California Coast, so they're celebrating up by Point Mugu and Oxnard this weekend and next with a huge festival...and we were going to go and meet some of my co-workers there...but after all the stuff we did today, I think we're just going to stay home and relax.  Deane drove down to Irvine to get the bed and I stayed home to get her room ready...plus after he got home we went shopping to try and find the camera...and out to dinner...so we've actually been busy busy busy all day...not to mention Hannah waking up about 2 hours earlier than she normally does on the weekends...thanks Hannah.  She usually sleeps in until 9:00 or 9:30...but today she was up at 7:00 *eyes bulging* I couldn't believe it.  I let Deane sleep in though until 10:30, but then his brother called and I made him get out of bed.    Anyway--I'm off.  My arms are sore from carrying Hannah today.  I had to take a bunch of empty boxes out to the dumpsters, but can't leave Hannah here alone of course...so I made three trips...all with Hannah in one arm and boxes in the other...down the steps, over to the dumpster, back up the steps, back down the steps and back out to the dumpster.  I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE!!! :-)

        tagboard   Did  urlLink Tagboard  make it so that you can't change the color of your smilie's unless you upgrade to their rip-off $20 a year service??? HUH??? How cheap is that.  I'll have to look into a new board now *frown!*

        FINALLY!   RAAARGH!  I haven't been able to see any blogs from blogspot, including mine, and I've been trying to post, but it won't let me. UGH...so it looks like things are better today, hoping that it lets me actually post this entry.  This week we bought our plane tickets to Seattle! YEE-HAW! I can't wait.  We were going to go next weekend, but the prices were way to expensive, so we're going at the end of the month instead.  So I'm getting worked up and all excited.  Today we're going to Costco to get our video camera/digital camera...so we'll have it in time for our trip.    Some more good news, we're going down to Irvine this afternoon to pick up a toddler set for Hannah.  She's too little to sleep in it still, and we don't know what it looks like, but it'll be nice to have it...and it's free...and supposedly like new...  Anyway-I need to start getting ready to go.  Deane went to pick up his brother's truck that we're borrowing to transport the bed set...and he's getting us lunch on the way home...but I'm not dressed yet and my hair is still up in the towel after my shower...so gots to go!!!

        another great saturday!   My weekends get better and better.  Today we woke up early and were out of the apartment before 10a.m ( a record I might add ) and went to have my tests done, then we got the car washed at Lenny Dykstra's Car Wash, if internet explorer wasn't being crappy tonight, I'd find a link...he was on the '87 New York Mets...and now he owns two car washes here in Simi Valley.  When you walk into the lobby to wait for your car, he has this huge sports case with tons of autographed Baseball, Football and Hockey stuff in there...it was soooooo awesome...I coulnt' believe it.  Then we had breakfast at Denny's and took Hannah to the park to wear her out...  Then we came home and all took a loooong nap!!!   Tonight we went out (without Hannah) to dinner at BJ's (again, if IE didn't suck, I'd give you a link)...and I made the mistake of ordering desert...ugh...I feel like my stomach is going to explode...blah. BUT...it was soooooo worth it.  I got the "Pizookie" it's a huge deep dish cookie with a ton of Vanilla Ice Cream on top, I got half a chocolate chunk cookie and half peanut butter cookie...mmmmm...Deane had a hot fudge sundae that was bigger than his head.    Anyway--I think Hannah is waking up.  Rachael said that for about 20 minutes after we left, she stood over by the window with her hands on the window and her head lying on the sill crying...then she'd go over to the door and reach up and cry for us... *tear*  It was sooo sad to hear that...but they did a good job of calming her down and getting her to eat dinner.   Goodnight!!!

       different?   It's going to take a few days for me to get my links back up here...I got tired of my old lay-out and so I changed it around a little bit!!! And then I changed it back. I just get bored SOOO easily... I can't decide whether or not this lay-out is going to stay up or not...hmmm...we shall see. I'm feeling creative?

        a what???   Yes...a door-handle-less Toyota Camry...That's what I said. We were driving home from a birthday party today, and I happened to glance over at this Camry on the freeway and it didn't have any door handles...what's up with that?  Weird huh? Yeah...I agree.  Lastnight was a lot of fun.  We went out to dinner at  urlLink Gordon Biersch  and then afterwards we went...shopping? Yeah...SHOPPING.  Weird thing to do on a date huh?  If you don't have kids though, you just can't understand.  It's so peaceful walking through a store and not worrying about having to say "Stop grabbing stuff...put that down...don't touch ANYTHING...Hannah if you don't stop we're going to go home."  Or having them get bored in the store and start crying and throwing a fit.  We were able to spend as long as we wanted in each store...it was nice.  We ended up at  urlLink IKEA  and not intending to, we bought a new desk and a new leather office chair...it's sooooo nice having more room in our bedroom.  We had a regular desk before with an add-on stand thing for our scanner and printer...but now we have a corner desk with a hutch and lots of roooooom for all of our stuff and more room in our bedroom...  Oooh, I'm chatting with my friend Rashauns mom...she's like another mother to me...I miss them so much! She's going to call me...I'm going to end this now so I can gossip :-)

       where have I been?   I'm not sure where really.  I come online everynight to check my pathetic email (I haven't gotten any emails in the last week except the CNN BREAKING NEWS alerts...ugh)...and I think that pretty much deflates my mood, so I just log off and don't even open IE to look at my blog...  Easter was fun.  We took Hannah to the LA Zoo in the morning for a little Easter Celebration...she got her face painted like a little bunny (although everyone in Deane's family thought she was a cat and I  think  even a mouse...what?  IT'S EASTER! BUNNIES...WHISKERS...BIG WHITE EARS.  LOL.  I say this all in fun of course, I really like his family.  She went into the petting zoo and met some goats and a little pony.  We had the camera with us, but we forgot to take it into the petting zoo part, so no pictures of her planting a smooch-er-oo on the hooved ones...I'll have pictures soon though of the rest of the day.  Plus pictures of her easter eggs she colored at daycare and the basket she colored too...She's cute.    Everyone seems to be moving their blogs...or tearing them down...so I'll have to go through my list-o-links and clean it up a little bit.  I'm hoping to get to that this weekend...maybe I'll move my blog too...I'll think about it.  People seem unhappy with blogger...maybe I haven't been using it as much, but I'm fine with it...for now.     This weekend we're going out! ALONE! NO KID!!! I love her to death, but I neeeeeed this night out...I piiiiiine away for days gone by where I don't get to be alone with Deane for more than 5 minutes, and that's usually before we fall asleep at night...our conversation at the end of the day is usually like this:  Deane:  "I love you honey, I hope you had a good day today...what did you do at work?"  Sarah:   "I love you too...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzz..."  GREAT!!! WONDERFUL! So on Saturday I'm taking him to dinner at  urlLink Gordon Biersch .   Today is the 5 year anniversary of the day we first met in person (We knew eachother for a year before we met in person...and for those of you just joining the Sarah and Deane Story, we met on the internet...YES OPRAH I MET THE MAN I LOVE ON THE DEVIL-RAN INTERNET)  He hasn't mentioned our anniversary...so I'm starting to tap my foot and give him the "I know something important and if you don't bring it up soon, I'm going to get out a big stick and whack you with it" look...  What's with all of Suddam's  urlLink right-hand men  surrendering? Do you think they were all sitting around in bomb-infested Iraq, talking about how great Suddam is and how much they know he loves them and would never do anything without their approval and then one of them happened to notice that Suddam was gone and all that was left was his chair swiveling around empty?  "Uh, guys?  I think he ... left...now...what do we do???"  Heh heh heh...    Goodnight!!!

        urlLink Wednesday Wish     You're visited by the chore fairy who agrees to give you one wish for a chore you will never have to do again as long as you live. What chore do you wish to eliminate from your life (it will be automatically done for you!)?   MMMM CLEANING MY LIVING ROOM!!! I HATE IT!!! It feelsl like I do it ALL THE TIME!!! Everytime I vacuum or clean up, Hannah is like right behind me with cheerio's or a graham cracker or worse, a sticky gross granola bar...and then I have to do it AAAAAAAALL over again. UGH...TAKE IT AWAY!!! :-D   I'm looking forward to this weekend. This week has been hard at work.  Slow and boring mostly.  Nobody is calling, nobody is buying anything, nobody is doing anything.  Which means it's slow and the days draaaaaaaag by...I resorted to DUSTING THE FRONT OFFICE today because I didn't have anything else to do.  I'll be glad when things around that place pick-up...hmmm, it feels odd saying that...but I do wish it was busier...busy means Sarah has a job for another day...slow means chances of lay-offs loom in the distance.  *eyes-closed-fingers-crossed-tapping-on-the-desk-chanting "Please pick up please pick up"-over-and-over!!!*  Goodnight!

        hmmm   I don't talk about the war...and I don't talk about politics...but today I was in the lunch room at work, and was trying to kill 5 minutes before I had to go back to work and I'm standing there in the middle of this big empty lunch room watching the news.  I was watching these Iraqi's dancing in the streets, clapping and praising America and the other countries involved in helping them get their well-deserved freedom.  It was so amazing, because as I'm standing there, I realize...wow...you know...these people have NEVER been free...they don't know what it's like to be able to wake up every morning and make their *OWN* decisions.  Three months ago if they had been dancing in the streets saying nice things about us, they'd have been dead.  It's amazing. It gave me goose-bumps.  It's just so hard for me to understand what it's like to not be free...to not be able to make the decisions I make everyday.  I don't think I could cope.  I would never want to be in that situation, but it makes me wonder what it was like...you know?  I mean, to wake up one day and know you were under Husseins power and the next waking up to realize you were FREE...wow huh? Yeah.    Anyway--sometimes things like that hit me and I have to write it down or it will just overwhelm my thought process for DAYS.  I'm going to go look and see if Lynn has posted her  urlLink Wednesday Wish  question yet...*frown* Looks like she hasn't posted one since the 2nd...oh, well.  I didn't do that one...so I'll do it for today's wish:  The Wednesday Wish  Week Five You receive in the mail an envelope containing two tickets. The tickets could be for anything (a show, concert, flight, etc). What do you wish the tickets to be for?   OOOOH I would have it be two all-inclusive cruise-ship tickets to.................ALASKA!!! YEAH BABY!!! Here's the  urlLink Cruise  I would want...only NOT on Holland America, ugh...no way no Holland America...the stupid-crack-head-superficial-backstabbing-twofaced-loser-with-no-management-experience that I worked for for 5 horrible gut-wrenching-ulcer-causing months used to work for them...ugh...see what ONE person can do to an entire company's reputation? *gag*  ANYWAY I'm sooo off track with this.  That's what I would want. I've always wanted to go on an ALaskan Cruise and since Deane has made it clear he would too, only not for our honeymoon, I figure the only way I'll get to go in this lifetime would be if someone ELSE paid for it...or if it was free...or paid for by The Wednesday Wish Author (Just kidding Lynn!!!) Heh...  Goodnight!

        nope, not bored!   ....just TIRED...freakin' tired.  UGH.  Anyway--I haven't been around much, mostly because my life is pretty so-so.  Not boring, but I do pretty much the same thing everyday, and if I posted the same post everyday...come on now??? Even *I* wouldn't read this blog of mine.  On Saturday we went to Santa Barbara! OOOH PRETTY!!!  In the parking lot of Jack-in-the-Box the battery to our tired little car died (it's ONLY 5 years old...COME ON!!!) so we had to get that fixed before we could go, but that didn't dampen our spirits at ALL!!! The cold wind in Santa Barbara just about killed us good though. WOWEE...  I saw this next blurb on  urlLink Lynn's  blog.  It's called  urlLink Tuesday This Or That  and looked more interesting than posting about my day at work.    Who is:    1. Sexier (female)...Pamela Anderson or Jennifer Garner?  Ewwwww...neither one???   2. Sexier (male)...Ben Affleck or Matt Damon?  MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM MAAAAATT DAMON *RARRR*  (that was my attempt at a snarly sexy kind of growl)  3. The better piano player...Billy Joel or Elton John?  Hmmmm...I like them both, but since I have probably listened to more of Billy Joel's stuff, I'd have to say Billy Joel  4. Funnier...David Letterman or Craig Kilborn?  I don't think Craig Kilborn is on early enough over here for me to watch him that often.  I'd have to say David Letterman, his  urlLink Top Ten List  is pretty funny.  5. The dumber cartoon cat...Stimpy (of *Ren & Stimpy*) or Tom (of *Tom & Jerry*)?  STIMPY SUCKS!!! Tom RULES!!!  6. A better news anchor...Tom Brokaw or Dan Rather?  Dan Rather.  Again, I know I've watched Brokaw before, but I've tended to watch Rather more than him, so I think I turn in his favor.    7. A better TV chef...Emeril Lagasse or Jacques Pepin?  Emeril of course! Who the Hell is Jacques Pepin??? Just kidding.  I definetly prefer Emeril and would LOVE to eat at one of his restaurants...preferrably his New Orleans one since I've always wanted to see New Orleans ANYWAY!!!  8. The trashier talk show host...Maury Povich or Jerry Springer?  I LOVE Maury, because some of his shows are atleast a *bit* believable and Maury *seems* to have a wee-bit more compassion  than Jerry.  I don't like Jerry at ALL...too ...uh...creepy???    9. The worse fast food burger joint...McDonald's or Burger King?  OOOOH...toughie, I like food items from both places...but since I've bitten into more frozen french fries from McDonalds than I have from Burger King, I'd have to pick McDonalds.   10. Thought-provoking question of the week: Only a handful of U.S. Presidents have been considered to be *great* Of the following two, which one do you consider to be greater...Franklin D. Roosevelt or Abraham Lincoln? Why?  I think they were both great...and they are actually my two favorite presidents in our history.  I like reading about them both.  Lincoln played the key-role in stopping slavery and Roosevelt freed us from our depression...those are two of the things they did, there's more, but I like both and I think they were both excellent presidents.   THANK YOU AND GOODNIGHT!!!

        Home sweet home...or is it?   We got home safe and sound.  We landed on Sunday in beautiful sunny 86 degree weather.  Seattle was nice too...we were so tired though, that mostly all we did was stay at home with my family and visit.  It was sooo nice though.  Wow.  I couldn't believe how good it felt.  I got a little upset Sunday when we left and didn't talk to Deane at all on the drive to the airport (like it's his fault or something???)  So to make it up to him, I bought him a KILLER Seattle Mariner's hat...I can't find a picture of it for some reason...but it's really freakin' cool...take my word for it LOL  This week has mostly just been a catch-up-on-sleep-get-used-to-working-again week.  Plus baseball started...MMMMMMMMM BASEBALL...I must say though I'm a teeny bit upset with my  urlLink team , which are the above mentioned Mariners.  They lost to the OAKLAND A's...COME ON!!! I maybe could've handled it if they'd atleast tried...but they were lookin' like little leaguers...ugh.  They finally won tonigth though.  My prank of the week:  I put little pieces of tape on the letters of Moe's keyboard ... and then put a piece of tape in the earpiece of her phone...She got to work today and was typing away...when the phone rang she couldnt get her hands off the keyboard, and finally she picked up the phone and went to pull it away from her ear...OK you get the picture...it was pretty funny...She's an Oakland A's fan...she really had it comin' to her.    I took a bath tonight...mmmm...soothing.  My mommy gave me soem bath beads for aromatherapy stuff...I didn't think they really worked until I actually tried them tonight.  I feel so much better, much more relaxed.  I don't feel that pinchy nerve feeling I get in my back either...mmmmmm nice.    OK that's enough mmmmmmmmm'ing for one night.  Goodnight!!!

       mmmmmmm weekend   I'm sooooooo glad to be done with this week!!! Me and Hannah are having a "gals night" tonight. Deane and his friend Craig are out at dinner, so me and Hannah had some fine cuisine, a little wine and we watched an opera.  OK...so no.  We had pizza, she drank apple juice, I had a diet 7-UP and we watched "Nature Babies" on tape.  Now she's lounging on the couch watching "Nature Babies" again...I can only take so much "Nature Babies" LOL...  Today I got my birfday present from my friend Moe-Z...she got me a  urlLink Mariners  bobble head with Mickey Mouse wearing an M's jersey.  I LOOOOOOOVE IT! IT'S AWESOME...I'll have to take a picture of it next to the glass she got me...also a Mariners glass.  I've decided which of the Mariner's I'm most in love with...mmmmmmmm  urlLink Joel Piniero ,  urlLink Gil Meche ,  urlLink  Ben Davis  and everyone's favorite  urlLink BRET BOONE ...*drool*.  Although for some reason, they changed his team photo and he kind of looks like a dufus...oh, well. I know what he looks like and that's all that matters...*drool*  Anyway *aheam*  I should go.  Hannah is being  toooo  quiet in the living room.

        almost friday...   Deep breath...in...out...in...out...OK better. MY GOODNESS...for a short week this one is reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaally taking it's time!!! It feels like it  should  be Friday night instead of  Thursday ...but nooo...one more crappy day to get through.  It's not work that bothers me.  I seem to do better at work, when I have my mind on other things...besides money and missing my family, and wanting to go to school, and getting my license (Yes, I don't drive) and all this other crap that I think about all the time.  If I'm not busy, I'm obsessing over the things I should have.  Instead of being greatful for what I  do  have, I'm obsessing over things I want...or things I think would make my life   even  better. Talk about coo-coo coo-coo huh? Ungreatful b***h.  Whatever.     Sunday is my birthday.  Maybe that's why I'm so idgity...I don't want to get any older.  How sad.  I'm not even 25 yet and I already feel old.    Anyway--tonight was ok.  I didn't obsess or feel sorry or anything.  Maybe I'm improving? I hope so. We went swimming when we got home, that was nice. I like being in the water, I just don't like my face getting wet or being ass-grabbed in the pool...probably due to two different occasions as a younger type person where I almost drowned (I'm sorry AGAIN mom) ... but Hannah had fun and so did Deane and I.  The water was nice and warm, so our lips didn't turn blue as soon as we jumped in and Hannah is starting to relax in the water and she actually splashed around a bit, usually she just clings to us and her little lips chatter because she's cold.    Tomorrow it's odds and ends laundry for Hannah and I and then packing.  Why? Another trip you say? Where to you ask??? Hmmm...try this on for size... urlLink Sarah's Birthday Weekend .  Fun? OH YEAH.  I love San Diego and I've never been to Sea World, so it should be nice.  We're going down with two friends, one of which has a birthday tomorrow (I  think  it's tomorrow)...so it's a trip for both of us...they have a son around Hannah's age too, so it should be a family-fun-filled weekend.  We leave Saturday morning and come back Sunday.  Awww...weekend getaway.    So I guess things aren't so bad.  I must start thinking positive...I must start thinking positive...I must start thinking positive...I must start thinking positive...I must start thinking positive...  Maybe if I repeat that over and over *closing eyes tight...* I must start thinking positive...I must start thinking positive...I must start thinking positive...I must start thinking positive...  Goodnight!!!

        mmmm nice day   Today was nice.  The bad weather went away (It must've heard my threatening tone the other day)...so we went out to lunch and then over to his mom's for a BBQ (mmmm...steak) and then came home and went swimming.  Poor little Hannah no likie the cold water!!! She acted like we beat her or something because when we finally got out of the water, she just put her head down on our shoulder and laid there like a limp french-fry.  Poor thing.  She lightened up though when we came home and she warmed up a bit and got ouf of her soggy  urlLink Little Swimmers ...she's ok now.     I'm looking forward to only 4 days of work this week.  That will be refreshing.  It's my second long weekend in a row, but I still dont' care.  I don't want to go back, but if I  have  to, atleast I've only got 4 days instead of 5.  I found out if I get that other job this week too.  I interviewed again for it last week and was told I'd know by the end of this week either way.  So hopefully it will be a yes...but if it's a no...than I'll be ok with that too.  Atleast they considered me right? Right.    Anyway--my skin feels all dry from swimming, so I'm gonna get out of here and go find some lotion and maybe a nice man to rub my feet.  :-)

        she makes me laugh...   My daughter...my beautiful little daughter...my precious pearl...my sweet pea...our little princess...our monkey-toes...our Hannah banana...she makes me laugh.  Because if I wasn't laughing, I'd be crazy...I'd be crying hysterically banging my head into walls and pulling my hair out.  This is what she did to herself today...with lunch.  I was feeding her chicken strips and french fries, left-over from our dinner at  urlLink Red Robin  lastnight.  I gave her some ketchup, because I know how un-tasteful fries can be reheated...and within MINUTES...I kid you not...MINUTES...this is what she looked like... urlLink here ,  urlLink here , and  urlLink here . (That last picture is my favorite)  Funny.  After I rinsed it out of her hair, off of her toes (YES, her TOES) and out of her ears...I came in the bedroom, shut the door and took a deep breath.  It is quite funny actually...it would've been funnier though if the outfit she was wearing wasn't new. *sigh*   Our trip to Nebraska was fun.  We actually got home a week ago...but this last week was long and tiring and I didn't feel much like internetting at all.  I kept up with a few blogs, but that was it.  Oh, and Fantasy Baseball...one day I'm in the lead for the whole season, and the next I'm behind by almost 30 points! What the???  Anyway...atleast I'm holding onto 2nd place.  Not a bad place to be really.    Anyway--I'm thinking of going back to Nebraska for the 4th of July. WHY? Uh, because I bave family there, and I love the mid-west.  NO, I'm not kidding.  I really enjoyed it back there, and when I've been there in the past, I really liked it.  Housing is soooo cheap too...man, I was amazed that you can get houses so cheap.  Houses back there that sell for 96,000$ are houses you can't find here for less than 400,000$.  Yikes. You can't even find a trailer on wheels with pinwheels and pink flamingo's in the yard for 96,000 here.  The job market out here is better though, so that equals it out I guess.  But still...man alive!!!   It's been 90 freaking degrees here all last week...so we're thinking YAY! Memorial day weekend! 3 Days! We need bathing suits to we can hit the beach and hang out by the pool! SO we buy our suits...Friday morning we wake up and it's 58 and rainy out. WHAT THE??? It's been like that ALL weekend.  Craptacular.    Anyway--time to go!

        new job? ... maybe    I'm thinking of applying for a new job...within the same company.  Different department, different supervisor...different from any other job I've ever done.  Hmm...we'll see.  Tonight we had a friend of Deane's over for dinner. He brought Hannah a cute little a, b, c book. It's an animal book and it's wooden and tied together with yarn, and it has little magnet pictures in there that you can remove...it's cute and she  loooooooooved  it.  The sad thing is, that she can only play with a toy for like 10 minutes before she gets bored with it...and needs a  break  from it before she can play with it again. So I'm sure, to our friend, it looked like she was un-interested...but we know differently.  I haven't seen her take to a toy like that in a long time.    I finished my  urlLink 100 Things  lastnight. It took me like 2 months to put it together.  Weird huh?  I missed  urlLink Friends  tonight...anyone know what happened?  We were watching  urlLink Eddie Izzard  instead.  He's a crack-up.  He's a british cross-dressing comedian...toooo funny.    Anyway--I was going to do a meme today, probably the thursday-thumb-twiddler  but I changed my mind. I'm too sleepy.  Goodnight!

        strange...   Have you ever had to say goodbye to a co-worker that you don't really know that well, never really had to work closely with and really have nothing in common with? But they're leaving the company, it's their last day and they're saying goodbye to everyone...including you.  What do you say? Do you make something up? Fib? Pretend like them leaving is going to effect the rest of your existence??? No...of course not.  You hug them politely, wish them luck in their endeavors and bid them farewell...and then they invite you to their going away party...WHAT??? Yeah. But I'm not going. I have plans.  Too busy.  It's a L-I-F-E.     WOW, I'm on a MEAN kick lately.   Sorry!!!  OH OK...so this girl that I've known like my whole life...she's like a little sister to me.  We grew up next door to eachother...she's 4 years younger than me. I love her to death.  We moved away from eachother after I graduated...but we've kept in touch.  She's been telling me for like the last 2 months that she's unhappy living with her mom and step-dad...ok.  So she tells me she's going to join the Air Force. OK...she's been saying that she wants to join for like 3 years...but now she's 18 and can finally join. Great. I'm happy for her, she's super intelligent (I mean like Ivy League smart)...and a few weeks ago she says she can't take it at home anymore and until she can get into basic training, she's going to move in with one of her friends.  OK.  That was the last I heard from her, so I  assumed  she'd done just that.  But tonight...her mom...who is like my 2nd mom...emails me and say not only did my friend run away from home (technically, she's 18...but still...) she ALSO got MARRIED. WHAT??? HELLO??? She told me about this guy she'd been dating, they'd only been dating for like...an hour...OK, more like 6 months...but still.  They got married so that after basic training they can stay together.  WHAT? He's joining the AF too...ugh.  So now I'm upset.  I love her and I love her mom...and I want to take both their sides.  But I'm not going to do that. ESPECIALLY now that I know she was not completely honest with me!  So I'm just there for her and for her mom. If she writes me, I'll be there for her.  I'm neutral...I'm on the fence...I'm sitting in the middle seat...I'm everybody's friend.  I'm their shoulder to lean on.  And I don't mind.  They're my second family.  It still hurts though.  I'm a bit sad tonight.   OK time for the  urlLink Wendesday Wish ...I'm glad it has to do with something positive.  I could use that right about now.    What one positive thing would you wish for your life right at this moment?   I would wish for Hannah to stop crying and to finally go to sleep.  No. Kidding.  I would want someone to come up to me and say that they will help us pay for us to get married...that's pretty much the only thing stopping us.  Not necessarily OTHER people's money...but just money in general.  Donations being accepted *wink*

        urlLink Daily Double     1. If you can meet any celeb in the world, who would it be?   Hmmm...proooooobably hmmm...wow. I can't think.  Probably one of the cast members of  urlLink Friends ...I'm sure this will change, but right now I can't think of anyone else.  Except maybe  urlLink Lance Armstrong ...I think he's a real hero, overcoming everything he's overcome and still being one of the greatest athletes...SO YEAH, one of those guys...*smile*   2. You house is burning down...you have 2 minutes to grab 4 items. What 4 items are you going to take?  I'm going to assume that this is material items...not anything like children, cats or fiance's...soooo my four items would be...my address book, a family portrait, my purse and a  urlLink Boyds Bears and Friends  bunny (Lefty....on the mound) that my mom gave me when I was playing softball.     I'm real tired. We went to the zoo today and then came home and I cleaned our bedroom.  I mean REALLY cleaned it.  Vacuumed, laundry, cleaned under the bed...everything.  Whew...tired.  Hannah figured out how to open our sliding glass door (not the glass door actually...just the screen door...but still) I just walked out there and she's waving at me from the other side of the door, outside on our balcony!!! UGH! Her and our cat Ralph are quite a pair, always scheming up ways to get outside.  Speaking of cats...today Hannah learned how to meow...if you ask her "Hannah, can you talk like Fiddy?" she says in this little tiny petite baby voice "eow!"  (No M...just "eow")  ... it's  sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo  freaking cute.    I think she's outside again...have to go shut the glass door I guess...She even can unlock the screen part...ugh. Here we go.

         urlLink Saturday Scruples    Ooops...it's 1:02 a.m. on Sunday...I hope these still count for Saturday :-)   Browsing in an "adult store" at lunch hour, you witness a colleague buying a large inflatable woman. Do you mention it to co-workers?  OHHHHHHHH YES, you NEVER pass this up!!!   Your eight-year-old is getting pushed around at school. Do you tell your child to "turn the other cheek"?  No way...you stick up for yourself...you don't fight or push back...but you NEVER teach your children to allow themselves to be treated like that...NEVER.   An armored car turns over across the freeway. People are stuffing their pockets. Do you join them?  Hmmmm...Good question.  Tougher than the other two.  I would probably take the money and then out of guilt turn it in...it IS the right thing to do.

Puh-lease.  If you're going to spam people, DO IT RIGHT!!! *smile*

        I HAVE WON...I BEAT THE BLOG!!! HAAAAAAAA!!!   I fixed it!!!  *bending over and sticking my tongue out*  HA!  *dances around and flails her arms wildly!!!*    Anywho--*ahem*  *straightens out her shirt*   How can it be that I spent the whole day indoors, AND manage to not go absolutely crazy-out-of-my-mind psychotic??? Huh?  It rained today, so no BBQ, no Zoo...no fun outdoors.  But we stayed in...had  urlLink Cinnabon  for breakfast...chili dogs ala Sarah for lunch and then napped...when we woke up, we were going to order take-out for dinner from our favorite bbq place (to make up for no bbq at the park) but instead Deane's brother invited us over for lasagna...mmm...yum.  He was alone tonight with his two daughters because his wife was out with friends, so we hung out over there for a few hours.  Hannah, I swear, must think when it's time to come home "Man, back to the boring apartment with NO stairs to climp up and down and no hard-wood floors to throw stuff on and make loud noises with."   *frown* OH WELL!!! TO BAD--it's bedtime ANYWAY!!! Stinker.  Deane is playing a  urlLink video game , I was playing it for awhile, but then got tired of it and came in to check email...then I noticed my blog wasn't frickin-frackin' working, so I worked on that, took down my graphics that I had up...and that fixed it.  Now I'm chatting with my mom...and she told me about a  urlLink movie , it's one thing right after another :-)  A quick trip to the computer turned into almost a two hour sitting frenzy.  Atleast talking to my mom is relaxing...fixing my blog almost drove me batty. But *sigh* alas, it's fixed now. So I can climb down off of the bridge and stop freaking out.  I tracked down someone I went to High School with. I haven't emailed her...I never liked her, and we went to school together for 13 years...and all 13 years I couldn't stand her...I wouldn't go near her with a 10-foot pole...so why would I email her now?  I just wanted to see if she had  really  done what she  said  she was going to do...and I hoped she hadn't, so I could say I TOLD YOU SO!!!...but she did...and now I have nothing mean to say about her. Oh, well.  I guess I'm over it.  Over what? She never  did  anything to me...she just ............ was...ugh.   Anyway--I think we burned the cookies I was baking.  I told him to take them out when the timer went off, but he didn't hear it go off...so I have to go fix them the best I can.   Goodnight!!!

        sooooooooooooooo thankful it's friday   Every Friday when Deane picks me up from work, I get in the car and think "awww...thank GOD." Today was no different.  Such a strange week.  Busy...but strange. I can't really explain it.  Today started out crappy and got reeeeeeeally crappy and then got better...that was par for the week though.  I usually have one or two road blocks to pass through-out my week, but this was like road block after road block after road block.  Like yesterday when that sales person got pissy with me...what was up with that anyway? Today he was super nice to me and very very polite. Weird.    It's hard to believe that two weeks from now I'll be in Omaha. I think the last time I was back there was like 10 or 11 years ago...I'm excited. Not only is Deane's whole family meeting up there, but HOPEFULLY I'll get to see my mom's brother and his family. I don't think I've seen my cousin Ricky (sorry *ahem* RICK) since the last time I was back there!!! Wow huh?    OH, one more thing happened today.  A couple of weeks ago, Hannah's school took pictures of all the kids...you didn't have to buy them until you saw them...well...ok. Today there was a sign in her room that said the pictures were in. So we went out to look at them and see if we wanted to buy them, but hers weren't in there!!! Can you believe it?  Everyone else's were in there. They thought maybe she wasn't there that day, but she was...I remember...it was April 15th...Tax Day...who could forget? Yes, she was there for pictures...no, her pictures weren't in with the rest *frown* Poor Hannah.    It's raining! YAY! It started at like 4:15 today and hasn't stopped.  It started out lightly and now it's so loud I can hear it on our roof...which is strange since we have sort of high ceilings *smile* I likies!!!  Anyway--I'm watching  urlLink Bubble Boy .  It's a silly show about a boy who lives his whole life in a bubble...anyway...I have to go.  Have great weekends!!!

        feeling posty...   I don't have anything to say really, just feel like posting something.  Today at work a Salesperson got pissed off at me because I was doing my job correctly...he told me he didn't like my attitude and didn't appreciate the fact that I was telling him he had to do something a certain way because if he didn't, I would be the one to get in trouble...so screw him right? Right.  I was the bigger person though and acted as professional as possible...I SQUEALED ON HIM!!! I told my supervisor what he said and did, and she went up and talked to him and within 10 minutes I had an apology *big smile* Mess with me and I'll tattle...heh heh...No seriously...I just get fed up with sales people treating us like 2 year olds, or like we're there *for* them...ugh.  So I don't put up with it...and since I alone can't do anything to stop it, I tell my supervisor, and if there's one thing about her that I love, it's that she DOES stick up for us.   Anyway--we had plans to see a friend of ours this weekend, we were going to have a BBQ at a park on Saturday or Sunday, but then found out we could possibly get 3 inches of rain *eyes wide*  So we'll see what comes along.    It'll be nice just to have a weekend....*sigh*

        something funny...   Updated Employee Policy For Most Companies...  SICK  DAYS We will no longer accept a Doctor's statement as proof of sickness. If you  are able to go to the doctors, you are able to come to work.  SURGERY Operations are now banned.  As long as you are an employee here, you need  all organs.  You should not consider removing anything.  We hired you  intact. To have something removed constitutes a breach of employment.  PERSONAL  DAYS Each employee will receive 104 personal days each year.  They are called  Saturday and Sunday.  VACATION DAYS All employees will take their vacations at the same time every year. The  vacation days are as follows:  Jan 1st, July 4th, and December 25th.  ABSENCE DUE TO YOUR OWN DEATH This will be accepted as an excuse.  However, we require at least 2 weeks  notice, as it is your duty to train your own replacement.  DRESS  CODE It is advised that you come to work dressed according to your salary. If we  see you wearing a pair of $350 Prada running shoes and carrying a $600  Gucci bag, we will assume that you are doing well financially and therefore  do not need a raise.  Thank you for your loyalty to our company.  We are here to provide a  positive employment experience.  Therefore, all questions, comments,  concerns, complaints, frustration, irritations, aggravations, insinuations,  allegations, accusations, contemplations, consternations or input should be  directed elsewhere.

         urlLink Wednesday Wish     You have had a BAD day. You woke up late, no hot water for your shower, your hair dryer wouldn't work, traffic was awful on the way to work, you were late, a fellow colleague (whom you dislike and who dislikes you) then proceeds to inform your boss that you were late, you get yelled at (or chastised at least) for being late, and then comes lunch and you think things MUST get better. So off you go to the coffee shop to get yourself a coffee (or tea, or cappuchino, or coke, or whatever you like) and just as you're going out the door, someone comes barging in and spills your drink all over you. In the heat of the moment, what nasty end do you wish for their day?   OK...this is good.  I always have something nasty in my head to say to people like that...I just never say it.  I would think I would wish for them to go home, have their driveway full of garbage because OF COURSE the garbage truck accidentally spilled it and didn't bother to pick it up...then, when they walk into their house, not only as their toilet overflowed, but their puppy has ripped their living room to shreds and their cat has pooed and peed all over their bedroom floor because they forgot to leave the door open and it got stuck in the bedroom with no litter box all day...then they check their mail and find a summons for jury duty, a bounced check notice from their bank and a letter stating that if they don't pay off their car payment, it will get re-po'd...awww...TOO BAD...NEXT TIME YOU BUMP INTO SOMEONE AND SPILL COFFEE ON THEM YOU SHOULD SAY SORRY... YOU JERK!!!   heh heh heh...that was too much fun.  Thanks Lynn!!!

       ok   So I should either update this regularly or stop it all together hmmm?  Yeah.  I've just been sort of sluggish towards computers lately. Probably because work is revolving around computers (Not only because I work for a computer company either thank you very much) because we're getting this new and improved software program to run our computers...and we're "going live" with it next Monday, so it's testing testing testing, training training training, learning learning learning, practice practice practice...on top of our other normal daily functions...so the last thing I feel like doing is coming home and sitting down at  another  computer.   I'm sure Deane loves it when I'm on the computer,  I'm always messing with the display settings, changing fonts and colors and stuff...it must drive him bonkers.  I just went from "Lilac" to "Plum"  LOL...mmmmm fun.  I do it at work too, that was one of the first things I did when they installed my new software, I went in to the settings and figured out how to change the colors and stuff...my co-worker came up today and said "How did you get it to be a peach color instead of the blue color mine is?" MMMMM smartitude.  And she's supposed to be training  me  on how to use it.    Did I mention that when I was in San Diego for my birthday I got sunburned? Yes...I'm thinking of changing all my online names from "simivalleygirl" to "fryedkrispee"...whatcha think?

       birthday   My birthday was a success...apart from the fact that I'm another year older that is.   We went to Seaworld as planned...stayed at a very nice hotel, since we were with another couple, we had adjoining rooms, and between our rooms was a "common" area...with a full kitchen, a living room and a balcony...it was very nice.  Seaworld was definetely a success as well.  It wasn't 90 degrees out, there weren't a million people, the shows were fun, no long lines to stand in...even the food was better than uh...Disneyland.  Weird huh? Yeah.    My week even got off to a good start.  Today however, things went downhill.  I got to work and was informed that we needed to start keeping track of every call we get on a tick-sheet.  Great. Why would they make us do that? I'll tell you why, because one of our positions is going to "go away" soon I bet.  Ugh. So I had this nervous "throw-uppy" feeling in my stomach all day.  I can't afford to lose this job.  I'm not only not financially stable enough to be unemployed, but I'm not very good at finding new jobs.  Ugh. They scare me.
