      damn it...April's been meditating for like...forever! and its driving me whacko!!! she never listens or talks to me anymore...i hate it! ugh!! and well, David's made friends with jen. he never leaves his crypt now...well..except for patrols. i never get to come on patrol with them...that so totally sucks... i mean...i could help. April doesnt know this but when i was asigned to polish the weapons and thingys, i kinda...used them..i sneaked out and went on my own patrol. i dusted my first vamp!!!was cool...you know... it turning to dust and all...it was awesome...and the energy i felt was fantastic...power.... i felt ultimate power...

      okay...so...somethings really bugging April. she hasnt been telling me anything lately and it sucks. April treats me like a little kid. hello??? im 17! im old enough to go on patrols. plus im a potential slayer...and she could fill me in now and then but she doesnt...freak...the wiccans are always busy meditating and all. i could help with the research. or maybe the slayage. anything to keep me busy...just as long as they dont give me the polishing weapons deal again...

      alright...I dont get April. first, she tells David to lay off and then she teleports on over to England and begs him to come back...what is wrong with her? i mean, if you're going to tell someone to lay off, you wait for them to come back. and if they dont, suffer! thats the first rule of dumping. that's it...it's safe to say that my sister has completely lost it! i mean...what is she? numb? David's been there the whole time...and David's all love love love love April! and what does my idiotic sister do? go away David! i need time alone, David! it's just...damn it...what is wrong with her? cant she see what David's done for her? there are so many things that David's done for her. and she just...ugh! alright...nevermind...  later...
