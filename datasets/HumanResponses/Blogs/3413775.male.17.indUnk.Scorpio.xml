      I type 101 words per minute but it's in my own language.  I used to have really long hair, and people thought I was high all the time.  People always compare long hair with drug use.  I wish long hair was connected to something other than drug use.  Like, "An Extreme Longing For Cake."  A stranger would be all "That fucker eats cake.  He is on rum cake."  A mother would be all "Don't bring the cake eater over here anymore.  He smells like flour.  Did you see how excited he got when he found out your birthday was fast approaching?"  I've gotten the AIDS test about four times now, the AIDS test is scary.  Waiting for the results is frightening.  So I don't get the regular test anymore.  I get the round-and-about AIDS test.  I call my friend, and I go "Yo Brian, you know anyone who has AIDS? No? Cool.  Because you know me."  Mitch Hedberg.  Haha.

      So I have actually accepted my fate at being the biggest loser ever.  I can now close my eyes and put my Final Fantasy soundtracks ( READ: All the released soundtracks.  About.. 20 including piano collections. ) on shuffle and hear the first 10 seconds and go, "TOWN THEME! FINAL FANTASY 6! NOBUO UEMATSU!"  Don't hate me because the Japanese make the good video game music.  Announcer: And now, Homicide: Life on Sesame Street.  Bert: (Answering phone) Hello? Son of a bitch. I'm on my way.  (Gets out of bed and gets dressed)  Bert: Some poor bastard got his head blown off down at a place called Hooper's.  Ernie: Bert, I wish you wouldn't drink so much, Bert.  Bert: Well, Ernie, I wish you wouldn't eat cookies in the   DAMN BED  .  Ernie: Bert, you're shouting again, Bert.   Music Currently Playing:  My Heart Bleeds the Darkest Blood by Shai Hulud  Wow.  Good song from a good band.  Talk about emo.  Too bad they're breaking/broken up.

      So what a day it's been.  I woke up this morning with a killer charley horse in my leg, and man I have been walking around like a gimp for at least a week now since I also broke three toes.  Eventually I made it out of bed, because while laying there bordering between sleep and conciousness I thought, "Fuck.  I want a steak."  So off I went to Texas Roadhouse.  So I get there and there's people packed tight in the waiting area, so I go "Oh no.. This is ridiculous."  Turns out it was a party of thirty six!  So I got seated right away and proceeded to get the biggest steak on the menu.  It was   damn   good.  The baked potato was disgusting because they poured sour cream on it.  That thing had about 5 inches of sour cream on it.  That's about how my day went.  Am I the only one who is completely fed up with William Hung? I mean come on.  The guy can't sing, he can't dance, and his novelty sure as hell has worn off by now.  Yes, don't get me wrong, but the first 500 times he sang She Bangs, I chuckled.  Now it's just getting ridiculous.  I am growing more and more weary of the leadership of this country.  I read an article today about a possible reinstating of the draft today and I just can not believe that they would do that.  It would be political suicide and it's not worth sending cannon fodder to an obvious lost cause like Iraq.  If I was ever called, I would go, but I would always have a grudge.  We have already lost this war.  It's exactly like Vietnam.  We are winning the battles on the ground, but we're losing them strategically.  When we launched the Tet offensive in Vietnam, we thought we had wiped out the Viet Cong.  Which we did for the most part.  We absolutely destroyed them militarily, but it was a huge propaganda victory for the Viet Cong.  These people are more than extremists.  To kill one American is a small victory for them, and all we are doing is giving them more opportunities.  Let Iraqi's handle Iraqi problems.  I think we did right in getting Saddam, but did I wake up in fear of Saddam everyday? Fuck no.  I didn't give him a second thought.  What he did to the Kurds sucked and all, but he didn't affect my life in the least.  I am registering to vote this year, and I don't even know who I will vote for.  I am losing faith in both candidates so who knows?  But I know if I don't vote, then I have no right to bitch.  So I am going to vote, so I can at least say "Yeah, well at least I voted."  So last night, I saw Fleetwood Mac.  What a great night.  I've always dug them somewhat, but last night put me over the top.  One of the only downsides was some drunk guy behind me tapped me on the back and was like "Yo man, sit down.  It's better on the monitor dude."  So I said, I paid 100 bucks for my ticket and I have the right to stand up if I can't see.  If you can't see then stand up.  It's not my fault your wife is too short.  This lady in front of us had the most annoying ear rings I have ever seen.  They looked like raver ear rings with blinking lights.  Not to mention, that our section was fucking Grand Central Station.  Every two seconds someone went to get beer, or something.  I was like fucking sit down and watch the show.  If you want to drink beer, then do it at home.  It's much cheaper and more fun that way.  The only major dowside was that my mom was not there to see it.  When they played Landslide I thought about her and her memory.  She always loved Stevie Nicks, and not to sound like a sap, but when she first came on, I got a little choked up when I saw her because it reminded me of mom and mom's love for her.  I could of done without the last song though.  Not that it was a bad song, but it was a sad song.  They had a motif in the song about togetherness and the line went "Someday we will be together again".  As long as we're on the subject, when I get some money, I was going to get some guy to make the poem Ascension into a plaque type thing so I can have a copy to hang on my wall with my mom's picture.  Ascension, has got to be one of the best poems I have ever read.  Read and decide for yourself:   And if I go while you're still here, Know that I live on, vibrating to a different measure. Behind a thin veil, you cannot see through. You will not see me, so you must have faith. I wait for the time, when we can soar together again both aware of each other. Until then live your life to the fullest, And when you need me... Just whisper my name in your heart, and I will be there.    That poem was by Colleen Corah Hitchcock.  What a first post this was.  I think I am going to end now.  But leave me comments.  Music Currently Playing: Head Club by Taking Back Sunday

      Yesterday, I woke up at 5:30 to goto a town in the middle of the Virginia countryside called Bedford.  Why go there, you may say?  I read about the town of Bedford in a book called The Bedford Boys by Alex Kershaw.  The story goes like this.  Bedford was a town of 3,000 people and a lot of the men and boys grew up poor during the Depression and just joined the National Guard to make a buck a day and to impress the girls while in uniform and to play soldier.  Little did they know, that World War II would come calling and their dreams of playing soldier were now reality.  These country boys, would be thrust into Europe and chosen to spearhead the largest amphibious operation in all human history.  An operation called OVERLORD.  These men and boys landed on what is now known as Omaha Beach, at D-1, near Vierville-su-Mur.  What happened next, was in the hail of gunfire that followed 23 Bedford boys were immediately killed, 3 later killed in the subsequent campaign, and 5 survived the landing at Normandy.  Other Bedford Boys in A Company, 116th Infantry, 29th Division, which totalled 103 Bedford Boys, survived the war, but only 5 survived the initial invasion.  No town in the history of World War II lost more men in one single day than the town of Bedford, Virginia who's men met their destiny on Omaha Beach.  I reccomend this book to all.  Anyways, the reason I went to Bedford yesterday was because I went to the National D-DAY Memorial to pay tribute to not just the fallen of that day and all of WWII but to pay tribute to the living as well.  I woke up at 5:30, shaved and hung around a little bit and finally left at 6.  I got gas at the BP and then I was off by 6:15.  It was an interesting trip, going through the country side.  I have never seen so much hay in all of my life.  This was more than deserted.  This was the middle of nowhere of the middle of nowhere.  Also, never use Mapquest.  They sent me down all these country roads and it was the most boring, terrible route ever.  After nearly puking on the twisty mountain roads, I knew we were closing in on Bedford, because I saw a sign advertising it as "The Best Little Town In America".  Not much longer after that I saw a sign that said we were on the 116th Infantry Memorial Highway.  So finally, we arrived in Bedford after just about 3 1/2 hours.  It had obviously grown since 1944, because I expected it to be a very small town, but it was quite spread out with many modern conveniences.  It also had the lowest gas prices I have seen anywhere at 1.99   for premium  .  So we come up on the memorial, and let me tell you.  It was awesome seeing this big granite archway with OVERLORD carved into it from down below the mountain.  So the officer tells us to go to Liberty Lake Park, which was really pretty, and park so we did.  We eventually got on a bus FULL of D-DAY veterans, and I asked for some autographs to sign my book, D-DAY by Stephen Ambrose, and they were more than happy to sign.  I got veterans from all over, Virginia, Maryland, The Pacific Theatre, the ETO, Navy, Army, Marines, Rangers.  You name it.  I had it.  So we arrived at the memorial, and it was a beautiful place full of colorful gardens, and a big fountain emulating a beach.  They had random sprays of water simulating bullet hits, with statues laying on the beach of soldiers, and some standing up as if invading the "cliff" where another statue showed men climbing cliffs armed with hand guns.  It was truly an amazing site.  There was a replica of a German defensive posistion, which, funnily enough, was just a bathroom on the inside.  But it looked cool.  Then it was time for the memorial service, which was more like church than anything.  The Navy choir sang a few songs, and they just said the same old speeches.  But by the sound of things you'd of thought it was Reagan's funeral instaed of commemorating D-DAY.  I am sorry the guy died, but we were here for D-DAY.  The speakers were INCREDIBLY boring and their tone was monotonous and dull.  The cool part which is what I came to see is when they asked all D-DAY veterans to stand and all other visitors to sit while they played a piece by Copeland.  Then the loudest, longest ovation I've ever heard followed.  However, some folks didn't get the message.  I saw some people my dad's age standing up.  I was thinking, "Ok, if you were in D-DAY, then I was in 'Nam."  The memorial service ended in prayer, and then we all dispersed.  The coolest part of the entire day though however, was when I got my book, The Bedford Boys, signed by the author Alex Kershaw and one of the only surviving Bedford Boys left Roy O. Stevens.  I also got my picture with Kershaw.  Me and Roy talked for a little while, and I was in slow mo.  All of a sudden, I spurted out "What was it like there? I can only imagine.." and he says to me "Have you ever seen Private Ryan?" I say, "Yes." and he goes, "It was just like that.  Just like that.."  I thanked him not only for signing my book, but for doing what he did when he was just a young man in the military, and then left with the biggest smile on my face ever.  Dad and I soon left, and the ride home was so boring, I just fell asleep.  Reflecting back on the day, it was one of the most special days of my life.  To meet so many veterans, of a place and battle I am so interested in really made it much more real.  It's important to remember the men and boys of World War II because without them, Hitler could of succeeded in the Holocaust.  Without them, the Soviets could of pushed all the way to France and made the whole of Europe communist.  Without them, we wouldn't be enjoying our freedoms and liberties in the way we have them today.  If you know or see a veteran, just say thanks.  I promise, it's worth it.  What an interesting year it's been.  In the past 6 months, I've met and spoken with former President Jimmy Carter, met two Nobel Peace Prize winners, Elie Wiesel, and Jimmy Carter.  And met many veterans of D-DAY and WW2.  Music Currently Playing:  This Would Be Easier If You Would Just Die by Park.

      You know, someone said that to me today, and I was thinking.   "Wow, you are, you know you are so funny.  Do you write your own material? Because that is so fresh.  I've never heard anyone reference that outside the program before.  And yet you've taken that and used it out of context to insult me in this everyday situation.  What a clever person you must be to come up with a joke like that.  It's so fresh too, any Titanic jokes you want to throw at me as long as we're throwing out these phenomena at the height of their popularity? Because you know I'm here.  God, you are SO funny."  Stewie from Family Guy originally said this, but this actually did happen and that is EXACTLY what I thought.
