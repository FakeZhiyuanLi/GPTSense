      I was reading  urlLink Seth Godin's  Book  urlLink "Unleashing the Ideavirus"  and on page 152. Seth points out that if you can get all your sneezers of your target group in one place and get their undivided attention and make a genuine impact on them, that will turn into big sneezing, big sales, big growth, and big profits. On that thought, regarding the Hep Hop, my target is High School students, and my more direct target is drama type high school students. If I could get involved with the state speech competitions and host a swing dance there and give away free stuff to the students and win them over to the idea of the Hep Hop, and it's promotional plan. Then these powerful sneezers will go back to their respective schools and what will they talk about to the team members that look up to them as the best in their school? The Hep Hop. And if they enjoyed it, they'll be pushing others to go so that they can win more free stuff and come for free to the events. We can set up within that referral program that the top referrers each month get amazing prizes like free lessons and free admission, that way these people are becoming better dancers in the meantime, making them into even more powerful and more educated sneezers. We can give away t-shirts and free passes for lessons and have people "sign-up" to be on the Hep Hop promotion team to get the free stuff. Once they sign up they get the free stuff and a packet on how to get more free stuff. Then set them loose and give them a great time at the evening dance which would be right after the awards ceremony.  Too bad it's already over for this year. There have got to be other events which bring together the cream of the crop of the drama type kids from each school to one place to hit them all at once. Thespian conventions. All state band/choir. Boys State / Girls State (these aren't the thepian types, they're kids intersted in polotics, but they are usually influential people in their schools, and there is someone there from nearly every school in the state, and there is a dance at the end of the weekend with the Boy State boys and Girl State girls. and they're all would be seniors in high school.

      I've had problems over the past few months and years trying to either 1.)validate myself once and for all as the leader of Omaha Jitterbugs, and receive with that the privileges that a leader gets, or 2.)Find the other person who will take that position and live up to it, and follow them. I've come to realize that that person, now must be me, because I have not created ample opportunity for another to come in and do it. The problem is that I often face resistance to my lead, because there is a general consensus among the planning group that there really is no leader and all team members are created equal. This is problematic because with no leader, then there is no real direction. Any person can attempt to direct the group in any which way, and the long term goals and vision get mixed up and confused, especially when group members have different priorities.  Then personal beliefs and preferences become an obstacle when trying to determine the destination and priorities of the group. Personal conflicts within the group escalate and sometimes render the mechanism of the group completely non-functional. I've had no qualms in the past in taking the lead. The problem is that it's not spoke that I should If something comes up and I do take the lead and I lead well, the others will generally follow. But sometimes I face heavy resistance. Christy is away in Hawaii right now. When she is a part of the group, her energy can be awesome fuel for projects, but any more, her struggle to retain power over projects leads to secrecy on her part to prevent others from stealing a task that is "hers." This possessive attitude is not conducive to good business or to a positive group dynamic.  I still agree that major decisions ought to be brought before the group.  I like getting the input of the others. But we don't have a set person running the meetings, We don't have someone lighting fires underneath people's butts, distributing tasks, and setting up short and long term goals and game plans on how to achieve them. These "I'm in charge here, so let's get moving," type of role is a role that since unassigned, receives a lot of resistance when someone, myself, starts to play that part.  I don't want to stray away from the group, and I don't want to discourage group involvement. In fact it's quite the opposite. I want to encourage the group to keep their leader in line, and expect performance and leadership. Hold their leader to a higher standard, a higher level of commitment. I higher level of awareness & focus. Right now there is no motivation for myself or any other member to do that, except to see the project succeed. But what is the motivation to be at work doing more work or a higher quality of work than the others around you if the expectations for you and them are the same and taking the lead is such a hard path to take? If the expectations of you are higher then you can perform higher. It's like were pushing toward mediocrity and away from productivity. Hopefully we can resolve this in the near future.

      On another note, I was considering what it was that brought people back. I read marketing books and try to define what our "product" is. I've determined that it's not swing dancing. It's not really about the dance at all. The dance is wonderful, that is a fact, but that isn't the only thing keeping people around. It's the feeling that you get from dancing, from learning a new skill, from getting good at that, it's the people that you meet. It's the fun nature of the movement and the music. The improvisational and often silly nature of the dance. It's about being happy. Swing dancing won't solve all of life's problems, but I continue to devote much of my life to it because it makes me happy to make others happy.

      In trying to come up with things that will make this swing thing bigger, I've been willing to try just about anything, and by doing this I've learned a lot about what does not work. In reading and examining things that work elsewhere I've come up with many ideas for things that are more likely to work. My next big idea is the Hep Hop. It's a night of dancing for high school students only. The means of marketing and promotion will be totally self-sufficient. I plan to target the group of high school students most likely to enjoy swing, which would be band, choir, drama, speech team kids. I plan to directly target specific individuals or groups of individuals in this target market. I will target them to help promote. The promotion mechanism will be simple xeroxable flyers (coupons). On this flyer will be a place to put your own name, and there will be a referral program full of rewards set up. So if you put your name on the flyer, make a hundred copies, and hand them out to your friends, encouraging them all to come. The friend benefits by receiving a discount, and the referrer gets a point for each person that brings in a flyer bearing their name. This is what  urlLink Seth Godin  calls an ideavirus, creating a product that promotes itself. As far as creating an atmosphere that they will love and be excited to talk about, I've decided to recruit existing dancers to work on staff at this event. In fact, the only way for non-high school students to attend the Hep Hop will be for them to be on staff. Staff members will have certain rules or requirements they must fulfill while they are there working. 1.) They will ask people to dance. 2.) They will help people learn to dance and refer them to the Omaha Jitterbugs classes. 3.) They will offer historical information about swing dancing, swing music, and other swing related issues. 4.) There will be a jam circle at each event, and staff members will participate in the jam. This will create a positive energy and increase excitement among the attendees and the staff creating an event that dancers will crave all week long. This new energy will flow over outside of this event into our other Omaha Jitterbugs events, rejuvenating the Omaha swing scene with the energy that it needs. The only thing really missing from this idea is the location. It needs to be a central location and a safe location that parents aren't afraid of sending their kids to. Eagles is good, but I want something different from Jitterbugs' Night Out, Plus they have weddings on Saturdays. The dilemma is that we need a place that has a good dance floor, that's not used for weddings on Saturdays, that's available to us every week of the year. It can't be too expensive and I don't want it in a bar. This is an event for high schoolers. The Beehive is ideal except for location. There's no parking lot. It's in South Omaha, which has a stigma from students and their parents (unless they go to South High School).  I'm super excited about this idea. I think we'll start it up this fall. (maybe sooner). If we could start it up before school lets out for summer, then Jamborama could have an influx of attendees this fall.

      So I guess here is where I dive right in. I've been working with Omaha Jitterbugs since its inception in fall of 2001 (officially in fall of 2002), and have see swing dance in Omaha go from the nine glorious months of the Stork Club back in 1998 to the dead few years after that while I worked at Just Dance, Ron Shepard's dance studio, when there was for all practical purposes, no place to go swing dancing, and therefore no swing dancing. Throughout all this time, I've been grown to commit myself to the cause of creating and sustaining swing in Omaha. So far it's been working, with the help of some like minded individuals and support of all the jitterbugs that we've found in the woodwork over the years, my quest continues to be a successful one.

      What if Jitterbugs' Night Out served breakfast? Dancing til midnight. $5. Breakfast. Another $5 (or 6). People are already going out to eat. They love the company. They want to support us. They want to stay and chat anyway. If the cost is right and we could do it every week and get it down to a science. We could have midnight breakfasts every week either at the Eagles or at the Beehive. Why not at the Eagles. We ought to approach them with our plan.. ask for the keys to lock up. They can trust us. In fact we out to devise a plan to confront them and ask what would need to be done for them to trust us. Ensure them that we are true to our word. Ensure them that we are serious. Offer something outrageous to them to show them how serious we are.

      It's funny how if you assume everyone agrees that 1+1=2, you never have to talk about it or explain it or defend it or even pay attention to it. Then when someone comes along with a different idea, 1+1=1, then you start to question it, you get defensive, you re-examine, explain, outline why the answer that you assumed everyone already understood. In the process, it strengthens your belief in that fact, you can champion the cause, fight against the evils of 1+1=1.  A lot of things happen this way. Patriotism only thrives when there is a common enemy or threat.   When I assumed we were all on the same page with Jamborama, there was no need to spell out the vision, but now upon getting a glimpse of Christy's version of the event, I feel compelled to share a vision that I've had clearly in my mind for some time and maybe falsely assumed was a mutual desire for the whole group.  My vision goes deeper than dance. As I explained it to Lindsay this morning is that Christy's vision is all about bad-ass dancing. Bad-ass this and bad-ass that and shit. What she wants is to have a bunch of bad-ass dancers come to our city and take workshops from people who are even more bad-ass than themselves, and have bad-ass contests and djs and bands and music and parties and fun.   That's fine. Except that, there are camps like this all over the place. That's what every dance camp in the country is trying to be. That's what  urlLink ULHS  is. That's exactly what ULHS is. I think Christy and Amy should get married and run events together. If that's what the Cowtown becomes, I'll have to invent another event that fits my idea. Although I'd like to fashion Cowtown to be this event.  An event where dancers of all levels can have fun together. An event where dancers from our region are genuinely  nice to their students and treat each other with respect and giving teachers a chance to share what they love doing, which is dancing. Where we aren't setting levels and saying that these teachers are the bad-ass teachers and these teachers are the not-as bad-ass teachers. I want to treat them all as equals as organizers and encourage them to cooperate and communicate and work as a team. Creating division within the team members can't be good.  As far as the two levels goes, my idea is to have one level be for dancers.. Not bad-ass dancers.. but dancers. Anyone who knows their basics should be able to attend and get something albeit maybe not as much as everyone else, from the workshop. The beginning track is for people who would be lost in those workshops because they've never danced before, or they only know east coast. This is an opportunity for us to promote this event as a whole to our friends, our families, our coworkers and hook them from the word go, giving them a super fun weekend that's not over their head.   I'm not against having intermediate/advanced level workshops. If we have a Balboa workshop that's int/adv though, and going into the class, you need to know a come around and the basic and the paddle turn, we better have a class earlier in the weekend that teaches those moves. So that plausibly (even if not possibly) a person could take the one, get the info they need to take the other and succeed just fine.  I'm thinking user-friendly vs. user-exclusive. Nate said he didn't want to sacrifice quality for the sake of Betty  urlLink Blyer , and I get his sentiments, however I believe that we can still make a fun workshop that is both accessible to Betty Blyer and Bobby Bad-ass at the same time.   I want this camp to be about creating a community. Why don't I go back to  urlLink Camp Hollywood  each year even though I had a great time? It's not just because I can't afford it. There's nothing but that promise of a good time calling me back. What if I was made to feel a part of it. All my friends were there and it's like a "Same time next year" arrangement. What if I wouldn't miss it for anything. Highlight of my year. We aren't going to make a camp like that strictly on bad-ass dancing. Because it excludes people looking to be included, and these people will be our biggest supporters and our biggest promoters. If we can make them feel cool (which is all any of us are really trying to do with this whole "bad-ass" fiasco).  The people who come just for the bad-ass don't love us, they're lindy whores, they'll go to any event they can get their hands on for their own self-gratification and when we don't give them what they want, they stop coming around and they bad mouth us. That's not the audience I want to cater to. I want to welcome them certainly, and hopefully they can have some good clean fun with us.  I am not ashamed that these are my views. I will not be made to feel stupid for thinking this way. I feel this is a smart and fun and different way to approaching a swing dance event, that I really approach all Omaha Jitterbugs events with. I don't think Cowtown Jamborama should be any different. Don't take yourself to seriously with the whole bad-ass thing. Yes you're a good dancer. Yes we all want to be good and we understand that we can learn something from you. But ultimately we dance because it's fun. We like having fun, so if you give us a weekend full of fun, (rather than hard core, we're better than you, I'm gonna kick your ass in this workshop, I'm going to prove to you how cool I am and nobody else really gets it like Alan and Lisa type workshop) we'll love you. Think Sylvia Sykes. Think Kim and David. Think about the people that we look up to as pillars in the dance community. Why are they still around? Why are they still successful, because the people they come into contact with love them.  They are encouraging and supportive. That's how to be great.  So, what I propose it to have workshops that dancers of any dancing level can attend. And then workshops that non-dancers can attend. Then have some workshops for both groups, that everyone can attend. Maybe a beginning turkey trot or something like that... (Still bad-ass but not exclusive to people with 3 or 4+ years of dance experience, see.) Mixed in with this, we should offer other fun activities or situations or environments, like the corn-eating contest, or the beer and barbecue, or the idea i had with the cameras, All of this would be good fun, and that's what this event should be about.

      I'm feeling not so great today. I felt like this on Friday and left work about this time, less than an hour into my shift. I felt like this yesterday and called in sick to Old Navy last night. On Friday I assumed that it was because I hadn't eaten dinner or breakfast. Today though I did eat dinner last night. I did have breakfast this morning. I still feel like crap.   Good new though is that while I was not at Old Navy yesterday I managed to get the Jamborama 2004 site up and update the Omaha Jitterbugs site too. I also printed 100 postcards for LITP. We now have nearly 550 people on our mailing list. Pretty amazing I think.  I don't want to go home today because I have to miss work both Monday and Tuesday of next week because of the sales conference of Dave's that I'm going to. Plus there's a R&R this afternoon, (an associate assembly) where they give you alcohol and you get paid. I definitely don't want to miss that.  I was a little bummed last night because when at the meeting, I announced that I'd gotten all this stuff done within my tight schedule, the reaction was like, so what. Nobody seemed to care. I've got to learn how to run meetings and how to present ideas so the people will like them.

      I had an idea the other day that I'd forgotten until just now reading Seth Godin's  urlLink "Free Prize Inside."  The idea is to have disposable cameras at Jamborama in each welcome packet. Have the camp goers take pictures throughout the weekend and turn the cameras in to us and we'll put all the pictures up online (and maybe include them in the video). Result is that everyone has their picture on the site. More traffic to the site. They send the pictures to their friends who also go to our site and see info about the event to make it bigger and more fun.

      So, I feel like the Jamborama project is at a standstill. I've added 2004 info to the website but it's not uploaded yet. We need to lock in the other info and schedules and all that so that I can get a flyer done. Having all the info in the world won't help get it done if I don't find some time to do it. Old Navy at night is keeping me waay too busy.  Last night Kristin and Monica came over after I got off of work to work on Big Apple with Lindsay. Then I was supposed to be working on some CDs for Monica. I was able to get some changes made to the Jamborama site on my machine but didn't get them uploaded. I also got a LITP 2004 flyer designed. It's super cool, but it may take a while to print.. It needs to go out this week, which means to the post office tomorrow to be delivered by Saturday. I don't foresee that happening unless I pull and all nighter tonight, and even then.. It's waiting on the damn printer to print 100 times.  I'd be really happy if I had like 10 hours to just sit and work on this stuff, and I don't think I'll be able to until Saturday. My goal is to have completed the postcards. The Jamborama website and the Omaha Jitterbugs website done yesterday. Or at the next possible moment. Today. First thing tomorrow. Soon. Then I'll be able to focus on getting all the details of the camp hammered out and get the flyer done and out to print. Then I'll be very pleased with where we stand for Omaha Jitterbugs stuff. I really have been neglecting it and I cannot allow that to happen any more.

      I'm excited about  urlLink Google's IPO  announcement this week. I wish I had more than $500 to invest though. But I guess it's better than nothing. I have a feeling though that I'm royally missing the boat by not putting more money in. But I guess where I'm at in my life with the amount of debt I have, I have to live within my means. I was thinking in the shower today that if I could live on like $500 a month, and somehow earn $1500, then I'd have an extra $1000 a month. I could put that money straight toward student loans and have them paid off in just under three years. I'd be 27 years old with no debt. I wonder if that's correct.. I wonder what the interest rates on my student loans are and what impact refinancing right now while the interest rates are as low as 3% would have on my payments.   I also was thinking about the 503(c) status for Omaha Jitterbugs, and I think I'm going to go ahead and get that done. It's sat undone for so long, I might as well finish it. I think I'll talk to Dan Newsome about how they did it and then talk to our attorney to see if I can get them to do the work pro-bono if I have all the prep work done.  I need to re-evaluate our mission and goals as to why we should be considered charitable. I think that'll be good to re-focus and possibly even divide the group. One team working for Omaha Jitterbugs the charity, and then starting another business with paid employees that has a different name, and does different things. Maybe a production company. Jitterbug Productions or any name at all really. We could be shim sham productions.

      I understand that It's been a while since I've posted anything new, but I've been busy and really not had much to talk about. I'm excited that I get to go to a sales conference next Monday and Tuesday with Dave. It's a $1500 conference and since he's teaching at it, he's letting me go for free. What an opportunity. I've taken the time off from work, and I plan on learning a lot. I think something amazing has to happen in the next year. I should make a plan for myself this summer. I need to get on the ball and get things done. I want to get married. I want to start my own business. I want to start the hep hop and make that thing soar. I think that should keep me busy. I want to finish school and get my masters even. I want to learn to do what Dave does. I want to learn about marketing and sales and speaking and communications. I want to buy a building. Lindsay and I can live upstairs and create a beautiful ballroom downstairs like the Del Rey Ballroom in Lincoln. I guess I can create a timeline and figure out a way to get this done and what steps need to be taken to accomplish this, and then I can just go about taking those steps. I do know that getting myself out of debt is a priority and I'm quickly making that a reality. Yay! Educating myself is another priority, and I'm reading and trying to learn. Getting a degree is important, and I need to begin taking steps to make that happen as well. Once my debt is paid off, I'll quit my job at Old Navy and spend more time focusing on my goals for the future.

      I didn't bring lunch today and didn't eat breakfast but I grabbed some money before I left. I forgot however to take a short break while the catered lunch was still serving, so come lunchtime at 1:30, I'm left to either go get Greek from the mall or try the vending machine food. There was a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs in there. It was only $2.50. It's a big bowl. I put in my money and opened the door. The bowl was so big, I had to turn it at an angle to get it out of the machine. The plastic lid was nearly busting off it was so full. It had a Sbarro sticker on it and said spaghetti and sauce and meatballs. There was not much sauce, but the two meatballs were HUGE. And the pasta was also very very greasy. Some sort of oil, definitely not butter. Possibly from the meat. As I ate the food The processed meatballs were quite delightful. And filling. I had trouble finishing it all. I'm sure the dish was terribly unhealthy, but it was definitely a better value than it's hamburger in a bag counterparts at the same price range.

      So I was reading about this type of website, where the users could edit it themselves, and thought that this might be a neat idea for the omahaswings website. If anyone wants to add a local event or an out of town event or an article or a CD review or anything, they can update it themselves.   urlLink http://www.editme.com/WhatIsWiki

      Okay, so this guy has a eyebrow hair that's  urlLink 12cm long . This is apparently a world record. I have yet to measure it (or god forbid, pluck it), but I found an eyebrow hair that is well over an inch long, and possibly even longer than 12cm. I may have the new world record for the longest eyebrow hair. So what do I do with that? Who do I call? Where's my prize.  Hopefully I'll be able to add pictures soon.

      I'm gonna be so pissed off tomorrow when I have to wake up and come to work. Monday felt like a Tuesday. Tuesday felt like a Wednesday. Wednesday felt like a Thursday, and today feels like a Friday. I am so very ready for this three day weekend coming up. So in a surge of wishful thinking I went ahead and flipped my calendar to June. And do you know what I found? There are some really  odd  holidays next month. June 7 is "Accordian Lovers Day." I would think that for an accordion lover, any day where there's beer and accordions would be a holiday. Which could quite possibly be every night of the week. June 12 is "Red Rose Day." What the heck is that? I guess Valentine's day once a year just isn't enough. June 25th is "Take Your Dog to Work Day." Seriously, who but a fireman can actually take their dog to work? June 26th is "National Chocolate Pudding Day." Mmmmmm sexy!.

      I noticed a long time ago that the vision in one of my eyes (the left one) has changed significantly since I've gotten my latest pair of glasses. I've been living with it though and becoming used to it. Today, just moments ago, before I passed gas, I found that my eyes hurt and are more comfortable with my glasses off, and that my vision really is quite bad. I really need to get a new prescription. The only problem is how expensive new lenses are. The ones I've got are scratched anyway. So I'm considering either getting new lenses or just removing my eyeballs and donating them to Monica, since they're crappy anyway.

      I just decided that I must learn to play guitar and maybe piano too. I think I know what I'm supposed to do with my life. I was meant to be a rock star. I need to start a band, but not just any band, the best band in the world. I know the trick. Don't take yourself too seriously. Be very talented. Add humor into your songs. Be a good persona on stage and engage the audience. Good lyrics that stricke a chord with the listeners. Good melodies. I think I can do all of these and do them all well. So right here this is the blog post that will start it all. From here on out, I'll be working to start my music career putting focus on learning to play really well.

      One of Lindsay's Birthday presents came early, and I gave it to her last night. I got her the two MC Chris CDs. If you don't know who he is, visit his  urlLink site  and download some music.

      We had a tornado warning while at work today, so from 4:30 to 5pm we were in the basement. I had a cool talk on religion with  urlLink Shawn Thompson . We then came upstairs and were warned of a flash flood warning. I didn't take a call for the next half hour til I had to go home. I'm probably jinxing myself by writing this since there's still a minute before I can log off the system.

      I just went over to Albertson's on my lunch and got some chicken tenders and potato wedges for less than $5. They were good, but the tenders took so much chewing that my jaw is throbbing now. Not that anyone cares.

      At Jitterbugs' Night Out on Friday, John T approached me and told me that I HAD to DJ this event at Joan and Maurey Udes's house the following night. I explained that I wasn't sure what I was doing on Saturday, but if I was busy, I would not be able to comply under such short notice. It turns out that we weren't doing much, maybe going to the riverfront to catch a blues band (which ended up being rained out). So I agree to DJ the event, and invite our dancers to come. The place was georgeous and they had dance trophies and medals all over the place dating back to the 30s and 40s. They used to be amazing dancers, and I even got to dance a lindy hop with Joan. She's quite good still. Her switches were awesome! As people came into the dance they were drenched from the rain storm. When we left we all went to the Dundee movie theater to watch a midnight showing of  urlLink Singin' in the Rain . We all sang along and talked out loud to the movie screen. It was super fun! I love the midnight movies there. We don't go much because I also love  urlLink sleep .

      My brother Tim graduates from High School today. This is quite a milestone, as he is the youngest in a family of eight children who have all attended the same  urlLink high school . Saturday I went to Maggie's graduation and rode up to Souix City with Tim. When we were driving he asked me if I would speak at his Eagle Scout Ceremony. Both me and my older brother Jamie are Eagle Scouts, and now our younger brother Tim has earned the award. I'm terribly proud of him and honored to be speaking at the ceremony next month.

      I got a flat tire yesterday. I hit a curb and sliced open the tire on the way to Lindy in the Park. Brian changed the tire for me and put on the donut. This morning I woke up a 6:30 and drove to Tires Plus on 74th & Pacific (two blocks from the apartment) and then walked home. I called them when they opened at seven and they had the tire changed by 8:15. It cost me $71.07. For one tire plus service. I guess that's what the "plus" in the name is... Service fees. When i spoke with the guy on the phone he told me that my drivers door wasn't shutting, that the latch wasn't working. It worked fine when I took it in there. I pick up my car and sure enough the drivers door won't latch shut. So I took the passenger's seatbelt and tied it across myself to the door handle to hold it shut. I drove to work that way, and then when I got to work, I fiddled in there with a screwdriver and I get it to shut. I hope this was a one time fluke and not an ongoing problem. When I left the tire store, the guy said, "Let me know if you need anything for that door." What's that mean? If I have to pay to have it fixed they'll pay for it? I hope so. Maybe I won't need to have it fixed at all. Maybe my superior intellect and knowledge of all things car, has enabled me to fix what even the men at the Tires Plus store could not correct.

      This Weekend should be fun. I get to go to Souix City, IA to see my little sister Maggie graduate from Briar Cliff University. Lindy in the Park is on Sunday, as well as a bunch of graduation parties. Tonight is Jitterbugs' Night Out, and possibly some cow tipping. And I'm so excited that we get memorial day, May 31 off from Ameritrade! Yay!

      I went to Cricket on my way to work this morning to try and get my phone replaced. They're only open from 10am to 7pm. What is up with that? I went at 8, and they weren't there. I'm going to have to wait until Sunday I think, or next monday evening after work to get a new phone. I went ahead and put a freeze on my account, so now if you call me, you can't even leave a message. I think that maybe that was stupid. I also have no email at home. The internet isn't working. Lindsay is calling cox today to have them fix it. This is the second time in two months we've had problems with the internet. I think we need a new cable modem and a new router. We might as well get a wireless one so we don't have cables running all over the place.

      LINDY IN THE PARK MEMORIAL DAY BRING YOUR OWN MEAT!   Sunday May 30, 2004   What do you think? We bring a grill and they bring the meat? Cook out at Lindy in the Park. Bring the whole family for an afternoon of fun. Soft drinks will be available to buy inexpensively, and any hard drinks brought must be concealed and contained discretely.   Invite people to volunteer to bring side salads to share.  We provide hamburger/hot dog buns, katsup, mustard, relish and soda.   If I'm not mistaken this would be the second year for this event.

      I used to be in love with  urlLink Adult Swim  on Cartoon Network. Well, I still am in love with it, I just don't watch hardly ever anymore. The show that endeared itself to me the most was Home Movies. They've since stopped airing this show, and for different reasona (namely sleep) I've stopped watching the programming block. Well, I may need to start again, or at least set my VCR, because they'll start airing the show again.    Home Movies will return to Adult Swim's Sunday night schedule on May 23 at 1:30 a.m.   --SwimBuddha  (Note: This is not the announcement of a new season. Adult Swim has never announced it would cease airing Home Movies. Only that we would not be funding new ones. That has not changed. According to the latest schedule, we will begin with episode 40-52, then start over with episode 1. Incidentally, Baby Blues and Mission Hill are also returning May 23, replacing Ripping Friends and Oblongs.)

      Okay, someone who used to work at Ameritrade had a spouse who worked at  urlLink Oriental Trading . She brought in a big box of stuff one day and gave out little toys and stuff to people. To me, she gave a small inflatable monkey. Yesterday, a different co-worker was walking by my desk and started talking about the website that my monkey was   urlLink from  , and sent me the above link. That IS my monkey. That' exactly what he looks like, right there on my desk. On another monkey note, here's a  urlLink DVD  I bought today.

      So the dress code at Old Navy has changed. When I showed up to work yesterday, I was the only one in my staff shirt. They told me that I should have known that it had changed. I worked on Thursday and nobody told me. I have no idea what I'll wear to work now, because it gets dirty there. I can't very well wear junk clothes to work. I don't really dress casual much any more. I wear dress shirt, slacks and a tie to Ameritrade for work. When I'm lounging around the house I just wear jeans and an undershirt. If we're going out I wear a button down dress shirt and jeans or slacks. I put in a reqest tonight to get three weeks off from work. I really need to get caught up stuff.

      So, I'm starting to execute my goals. I think tonight I'll ask for the three weeks off from Old Navy or quit. I've put together a CD to try and give the files for the Jamborama poster to Steve Gordon to work on. My CD burner is malfunctioning though. I started Pilates today, and plan to continue it daily. I still need to burn that CD for Steve, Plus one for AJ and Maggie. I need to fix Carol's CD plus burn a couple greatest hits of JNO CD's for Cliff and Bob and some of the others. I need to get over to Sam's to get a new printer, and I need to go to Cricket to get a new cell phone, since I lost mine almost two weeks ago. They have a plan now to add an additional line for like $20 a month on top of your monthly fee. I'm not sure how that works but Lindsay and I may cancel one of our phones and switch to that plan, save us like $40 or more each month. I haven't heard back from Christy yet on what she thinks of the Jamborama ideas I've got. I went ahead and set up blogs for the other members and none of them have posted a single word yet. Ah well.

      I was bound and determined to quit Old Navy last week. I need time to get my other projects done. I guess maybe instead I'll just ask for some time off. Three weeks should be enough. I should be able to get myself organized enough in three weeks to get back to work. Maybe that would be a be better.. if they let me. Otherwise I may have to quit. Unfortunately though.. the thing with having a job like this is that you don't find jobs like this. You don't find places that will let you work three nights a week for just three hours. You have to first tell them you'll work whenever they want you to, then you cut back your hours until you're left with the slimmest excuse for a part time job you've ever seen. I think I'll do it tonight. Tonight I'll also get those files together for Steve to have him help out with the Jamborama design project.

      Okay, so we were supposed to start Pilates today. That didn't happen. The alarm went off at 6am and I was not ready to get up. I actually didn't get out of bed until quarter after 8, having to be at work at 9. What a lazy sonofagun. Tomorrow. Tomorrow we'll start pilates. I'm gonna be so fit, it won't even be funny.

      Last night I registered myself and Lindsay for the Cleveland  urlLink All Balboa Weekend  in June. I think everybody's gonna be there. Dan & Tiff are going. Sharon and Brian and Me and Lindsay are all renting a car and driving out. I'm trying to get the group to go out a day early and visit  urlLink Cedar Point . Bryan also brought up the idea of going a day early, except instead going to the  urlLink Chicago Blues Festival . Either one would be fun.

      I sent an email to Christy today asking for a truce. I did it for the sake of the organization. I want to see Jamborama get off without a hitch (or at least very small hitches). It's not that I hate Christy, or even dislike her. It's just that her goals and my goals for the organization seem to have gone seperate ways. I think there may be a way for this to actaully help the group if she's striving to move us to be known nationally and create awesome dancers, and I'm striving to be a place where people come to be included and feel welcome and have fun, then we might actually end up achieving both, which would be remarkable. I think that what happens though is that we will each close our minds off to the others ideas or wants instead of seeking ways to comprimise or come up with alternatives where both objectives can be met. Hopefully she'll accept and we can begin to do wonderful things for this organization.

      I was thinking for Cowtown Jamborama to maybe spilt the camp goes up into teams and have team captains that are in the teaching staff. Each captain will do special things for their team, and they'll have time with their team. We can have competitions between the teams and on Sunday we can have a picnic and games like Charleston races (three legged races). In the special workshops we can have a song picked and assign a different part of the song to each team and have them make up a routine and then perform that routine at one of the events having each team up in a jam circle type thing, and then at the appropriate times jumping in to perform their part of the routine. We catch that all on video. Maybe not for this year, but for next year we could have a cow down there to milk or something else. Some sort of other games or contests going on for the Riverfront Jamborama event. Have it start at noon or 2pm instead of 6pm. Add DJs for the beginning so we don't have to pay another band and so we can utilize the talent we've brought in.

      I looked in the mirror yesterday and noticed a definite gut has developed. So, starting Monday (I was supposed to start today, but I was up to late last night at the show) I'll be getting up an hour earlier and for four weeks and every morning before work M-F, I'll be doing the  urlLink Winsor Pilates  DVDs we burned from Sharon. Then on week five, I'll start supplementing the Pilates with jogging, either in addition to or in place of the videos. (I hope I stick to this)

      At the Cursive concert, I was standing there watching Lindsay talk to someone she knew from high school and accross the room something caught my eye. It was me. I wasn't sure so I waited for the conversation at hand to die out, and then I whispered to Lindsay that I thought that that guy over there looked like me. She agreed. She said, "For a moment, I even thought that it was your brother."  When Sharon arrives, Lindsay pointed him out to her, and she went over and told him about me. He said to her, "Was he at the Ben Kweller show." Sharon confirmed that I was, and he said, "I saw him there and I was like, Whoa!"  So my evil twin agreed that he looks like me and I look like him. A bit later he came over to say 'hi.' His name is Vince. We gave him and his friends passes to come out to Jitterbugs' Night Out.

      I found this posted on  urlLink another blog  and thought it quite funny.       I don't find the Olsen twins creepy, but I do think it's odd that   they seem to be increasingly recognized as sex symbols, considering how much they resemble troll dolls.   It reminds me of an article I read in Esquire Magazine last month. It was called  urlLink "The Jailbait Dilemma: Does ogling tweeners make us dirty old men?"  All I can say is.. I agree not with the ogling tweeners part, although it does make for a humorous read, but I do agree that the way these girls are portrayed on screen is increasingly suggestive, and inappropriate.

      So, I didn't bring my lunch today, and they were serving shredded beef in the lunchroom. I've been spoiled by McKenna's Badwich, and was not going to pay $5 for an inferior sandwich and some potato chips. So, I went to John's Grecian Delights downstairs at Crossroad's Mall and enjoyed a gyro and fries for less than $5. Then i called into work at Old Navy and lied. I told Sara the GM that I had eaten at Johns and am now leaving Ameritrade sick and won't be at work tonight. The truth is we have tickets to go see  urlLink Cursive , and I'm not wanting to miss the show because of a crappy three-hour Old Navy shift.

      So, I had the day off yesterday from work. I called in sick. Well, I didn't actually call in. I sent an email to let them know I was sick. I lost my phone. So I had the day off from work and I got some things done. The registration on the  urlLink Jamborama website  should be functional now. I finished the  urlLink Dan & Tiff  portion of the  urlLink Omaha Jitterbugs website  and the flyers for the Dan & Tiff stuff. The only thing I have left is the Jamborama 04 flyer. I also need to get ahold of mike and talk about the 04 video. Lindsay needs to send out the 03 videos and the contest money today. I need to work I think tonight and Wednesday and Thursday. I think that tonight I shall put in my two-week notice to leave Old Navy. We've lost three of the four managers that were there when I started, and it seems like time to move on. May is a busy busy month, and I don't seem to have any time any more. Meanwhile Lindsay is thinking of getting another evening job at a bookstore or something... aggravating since I'll be now freeing up my evenings and she'll be filling hers up. Ah well.

      Today's May 6th. This is my mom's birthday. She was born in 1949, which makes her 55. Not as old as I once thought of her. I'm 24. which is more than half her age. In seven years I'll be 31 and she'll be 62. I'll be the age she was when she had me. That will be 2011. Numbers are weird. If I had a kid next year, that child would be 6 years old by that time, that's kinda scary.  I used to think my parents were old, but I have a lot of friends or people that I feel very close to in a respectful peer sort of way who are in their 40s or 50s. I guess that's what being an adult is. I've always thought of my mom as a friend.. someone who sticks by me, but only recently, over the past year or so, now that Lindsay is around, that mom has stopped judging and instead treating me like an adult that I've been able to see her as a true peer. Weird.

      This line was uttered by Dave Arch yesterday . I believe it's another Sandlerism (see previous post).  I was thinking about this comment and it simple truth. We don't take advantage of that. People around us love us.. Why aren't we harvesting those referrals?  What if we did a thing every other month where we harvested these referrals? We asked all our current customers to submit the names of people who might be interested in learning to dance. Then we have a two day lesson. They can come either day or both days for free. Free for new people and $1 for repeats or existing customers. We teach east coast swing or something in a big gym and have like 40 or 50 or 100 people all show up to learn and then we collect their contact info and sell them on signing up for classes and coming to the dances.   Once we get the info on the referrals from the current customer, we could send postcards and make a phone call, and take reservations for this event. They can bring as many people with them as they want. The two nights could be the same but slightly different. We could plan it out to be super high energy and fun.. Maybe with some staged drama of some sort (like the goofy way the kids MCing the Central Roadshow had a pretend interruption etc.).

      Monday and Tuesday I went to the sales training  urlLink seminar  with Dave Arch. He named the workshops "Lead When You Dance." He credited me for inspiring the name, because of the time he'd spent dancing at our events, and how this method puts the seller in control of the sales conversation. What we learned was the  urlLink Sandler  selling method. I loved how honest the system is. Most selling techniques I've learned in the past are slimy or trying to trick or guilt the customer into buying... This method first develops a trust between the customer and the salesperson and then letting the customer know that if they don't want to buy, they don't have to.. giving them plenty of opportunity to say no. Then what sells them is your honesty and integrity, because then they open up to you and you can find what really is at the root of their need for your product or service and then remind them of that need or pain and get the sale because what you're providing really does help solve that problem they want to be rid of. And if it doesn't, it's not a fit, and you don't waste your time chasing the sale. This also leaves a respect in tact at the end of the sale, successful or not, so that the client can still refer business to you when he/she meet someone who needs what you've got and wants to deal with someone honest.

      We had breakfast last night at our place. Everyone got drunk and at a ton of food and then many fell asleep and some when home. I understand now that if we did a weekly breakfast after the dance, people would be wanting to stay all night. Dishes would be a pain, and people would be dancing while they were eating and all sorts of weird behaviors.   last night at the breakfast bash at our apartment, after I went to bed there was quite the ordeal. Tomatoes and bananas all over the place and wrestling and Vulcan neck pinches, and screaming and hiding and more wrestling, and then some cleaning. And I slept through it all. When I woke up, I watched it all on video.

      I got a Raise last night at Old Navy. From $9.30 to $9.60. Two raises in one week. I made a comment to Lindsay, that soon she too will have to give me a raise.

       If I ever opened a trapoline store, I don't think I'd call it Trampo-Land, because you might think it was a store for tramps, which is not the impression we are trying to convey in our store. On the other hand, we would not prohibit tramps from browsing, or even testing the trampolines, unless a tramp's gyrations seemed to be getting out of control.   -Jack Handy (SNL)

      I read today that Lincoln is now smoke free. This is from the Lincoln Journal Star.   LINCOLN, Neb. - The Lincoln City Council voted Monday night to scrap the smoking ban it passed late last year and go with the original, more rigid ordinance.   The partial ban was passed 5-2 in December and would have allowed smoking in businesses where food makes up less than 60 percent of total sales. It also would have given businesses leeway for separate smoking rooms.   The all-out ban that passed Monday 4-3 nearly mirrors the original version proposed by the Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department a year ago.   There were less than a dozen people in attendance and no public testimony at the meeting.   Councilman Ken Svoboda, proposed going back to the stronger ban after fellow council members Patte Newman and Jonathan Cook had changed the ordinance to allow people under 18 years old to enter businesses where smoking is allowed.   Barring any revotes, the all-out ban will begin being enforced Nov. 1.   Only outdoor beer gardens, some hotel rooms and research studies that involve smoking will be exempt.   "This came out of nowhere," said Councilwoman Annette McRoy.   Before voting, Cook called Svoboda's proposal "outrageous" and the type of "radical surgery" that demanded a public hearing.   Asked after the meeting what he planned to do, Cook shrugged his shoulders.   The handful of health officials and anti-smoking advocates in attendance burst into applause after the vote.   Asked if he saw the vote or even the amendment coming before the meeting Monday, Ed Schneider, president of the Lincoln-Lancaster County Board of Health said, "Absolutely not.   "I'm grateful the City Council has decided the health of people in Lincoln is paramount," Schneider said.   Lindsay is excited that this might happen in Omaha. It really only bothers me when i go out, and mostly we go out to our own events which are smoke free anyways.. I'm really not much for bars.. partly because of the smoke, and partly because of the folk.   What I find interesting is the prospect that Omaha may approve casino gambling here in the city and also may approve the smoking ban.. I can't picure a smoke-free casino floor.

      Lindsay and I went to see  urlLink Supersize Me  at the Dundee on Sunday, where the guy eats at McDonalds three times a day for 30 days and runis his liver and gets fat. Well, Lindsay and I on the way home decided to try a similar expirament. We'll eat three square meals a day, eating no processed foods. We'll take a muliti-vitamin every day. We'll drink the doctor-recommended eight glasses of water a day. We won't drink alcohol. We will exercise daily, both with stretching/cardio, biking/running. We'll do this for 30 days, and we'll examine throughout the 30 days our progress in the following areas: weight/physical appearance, energy level/fatigue level, and overall happiness level. We start July 1. This will be hard not to drink on the holiday, but I'm not going to cheat, even just once. This will be fun!

      I'm not sure what to think. My new temp agency Westaff sent me an email this morning telling me I got a raise to $12 a hour. Moments later I see my manager cleaning out the desks of two fellow associates. I walk by her desk to get a drink and she stops me to tell me that these two associates are no longer with us. They were both hired a month or two before me, and hadn't been hired by Ameritrade. Others who were hired at the same time as them were hired by Ameritrade a month ago. To my knowledge, nobody from my training class has been hired yet, so I'm not too terribly afraid, but I'm not comfortable about the whole thing by any means.

      So each year on the 4th of July we watch the Ralston Parade and then walk up the street to my sister, Nicole's house for a cookout. She invites the whole family over and they have beer and brats and it's a lot of fun. This year Omaha Jitterbugs is in the parade. We'll be dancing and walking and handing out info on our events. Afterward it'd be cool to have a cookout with all of them. I asked Nicole if I could bring them over. She said that would be fine. Today dad called and said that if I brought that many people over, the family would be uncomfortable and they'd all leave and that's not what this is about. So I told him that Lindsay and I were talking and since we didn't know who was coming and that it might be a large number we decided that we'd have to plan something else. Told him we'd probably be having people over to our apartment and grill out for ourselves. So, now we've gotta make some plans for 4th of July.  It's not that I expect that we should be able to bring a ton of people to her party, but since dan & Tiff will be in town and we'll have to bring them with us, and if Laura comes to, then others from the parade will want to continue to hang with us if they don't have other plans. It'd be rude to send them all home at that point, and say taht they can't come, so of course we'll continue to hang out with all our friends that want to, but now at a different location.

      Every day at work, right when I arrive, I have to open up about four of five different programs that I'll be using to take calls, or take notes, or retrieve information about the Ameritrade clients. On one of the programs, there is a "Tip of the Day" box that would come up every day when I started and it had no tips in it. Instead it had instructions on how to update the tips and add tips to the program for daily prompting. So I went to the web and grabbed a bunch of Saturday Night Live's Deep Thoughts by Jack Handy. So now, every day I have a different Deep Thought greet me each morning when I start that program. Today's is:  A funny thing to do is, if you're out hiking and your friend gets bitten by a poisonous snake, tell him you're going to go for help, then go about ten feet and pretend that "you" got bit by a snake. Then start and argument with him about who's going to go for help. A lot of guys will start crying. That's why it makes you feel good when you tell him that it was just a joke.

      Tonight we teach a new Class through Metro called "Swing Time." Here's the course description. Keep in mind: I didn't write this. I was asked to teach the class after it was advertised to the public and people were already signed up and they realized they didn't have a teacher.   From Count Basie to Britney Spears, Swing is the dance that gets you rocking the night away! This class teaches you the different styles of swing, from the 40's Big Band and 50's Rock 'n' Roll right up to today's Swing Revival and West Coast styles. Rick Brayshaw teaches the steps that will get you noticed on the dance floor. Couple recommended but not required: wear hard-soled shoes.   Anyhow. We have 26 students enrolled in the class. That's monstrous. The positive part is that we get paid, it'll be easy, and it's only like 2 minutes from the apartment, over on 28th and Dodge at the American Legion Post 1.

      Okay so I saw  urlLink him  again. There's a Subway/Goodrich on Pacific street around 75th or 76th, and Lindsay and I stopped for sandwiches around 6:20 or so on Friday, on our way to the Eagles. We walk in and there's a somewhat familiar girl standing at the ice cream counter giving me a funny look. I can't figure out where I know here from until he walks in. He's wearing a pink button down collared shirt, and I'm wearing a blue one. We start talking again. His name is Drew and hers is Quinn. They both live on Pacific on either side of us, I think he lives near 90th and she lives near 60th. We live right in the middle. If we see him again we're definitely getting a picture.

      My little brother, Tim earned his Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts, just like my older brother, Jamie, and I both did. I think it's really neat that all three of us boys got the award. Anyhow, he asked me to speak at his Court of Honor. I agreed to (it's next Sunday, the 27th, by the way). Then I was talking to my dad yesterday, and he's like, "So you're doing the Eagle Charge at Tim's ceremony." and I was like, "What's an Eagle Charge?" and he was like, "You know, where they just say, "You're a marked man.. Only so many people who start scouting actually make it to Eagle, and all that." Then I was like "Umm, I just thought I was giving a speech. Is that what Tim told you?" and he was like, "Well, I'm not sure what' he's got planned." and I was like, "Well you should talk to him about what he had in mind, because I think he's got it all planned out already." Then I spoke with Tim and he said he wasn't quite sure who was doing what. I told him that I had written a few paragraphs about him that I could share, regardless of what my role was. He called last night to let me know that Jamie will be doing an introduction, another scout will be doing a prayer or something, and I would be the guest speaker. I really think the world of Tim. He's such a wonderful person. I'm very honored to be the guest speaker at his ceremony.

      My Maxima is dead. Lindsay and I were on our way to teach our Lindy I class on Saturday, and my car was acting funny. I'd rev and the car just didn't have any umph. About half way up the hill just south of L on 84th Street (southbound), it just wouldn't go any further. It runs fine, but it felt as though the transmission was completely gone. So, we managed to guide it backwards up onto the median and we walked over to Cornhusker Beverage Mart. While walking back, one of our students from the class saw us and turned around and asked if we needed a ride to class. We decided against it, because by the time we taught class and came back, the car might've been towed away by the police, and that would cost us lots of money. So, we called the LaVista community center and cancelled our class. Then we called Tim to have him come help us push the car to Cornhusker. Vicki Kirchner calls up and and says she's in the neighborhood and will help us push. Then Stan drives up and is all, "Hi Billy, Hi Lindsay, It's Me, Stan." So he helps us as well. We get the car in reverse to Wells Fargo's parking lot, and then once Tim arrives, we get it pushed through to Cornhusker. And there it sits.  Dad let me use the Ford Contour that he bought for $1200 from Jamie and Jill. The thing runs terribly. It sure looks pretty outside though. It jerks around when you drive. It dies. The check engine light is one. It was a few quarts low on oil, and what was left was all black and thick, so I got an oil change and they changed the filters and what not, but the check engine light is still on. Dad already put an additional $100 into it to fix the spark plugs. Lindsay and I had her bother Josh look at it to see what he thought, and he priced out another $200 worth of parts that it may need including a fuel pump and a sway bar. The guy at the Tires Plus where I got the oil change said it may be the motor mount (I have no idea what one of those costs.) He also said that one of the rear tires is completely cupped, and that a couple of new tires are much needed, and I can get a pair installed for about $120. I think we'll take it over to Lindsay's family mechanic at Don's on Broadway in Council Bluffs. We'll see what he finds wrong with it. I can't believe that when Jamie and Jill took the car back to a dealer and they said they wouldn't give them a penny for it as a trade in, they turned and tried to sell it to my dad for that amount, and the goon agreed to without even test driving it or thinking that maybe it's not worth that amount. If I end up putting money into it and deciding to buy it, I refuse to pay for the repairs plus the $1200 or $1300 at this point. My offer will be to pay for the repairs and pay the difference of the price, which I know puts my dad in a bad spot, and there's no way that they're gonna get that amount from Jamie.  Jamie and Jill's basement is caving in and it's going to coast then over 10K to get it fixed. So suddenly, they're poor, and can't pitch in as much for birthday gifts, need to gouge dad for money on the car, whatever. The whole thing upsets me.  Anyhow, I'm in the market for a car. I don't have more than $1200 to spend total. I need a car that will get me around, and make it to work every day. It needn't look pretty. I don't care what it looks like. If you have any leads, let me know ASAP.

      Today is such a busy day. I guess all week is busy already. I work every day until 5:30 at Ameritrade, and Tonight I have a hair cut at 6:30 with Erin! I love going to get my hair cut. Erin is so nice. Also, I think I have a private lesson with Miriam at 8pm. Also, my brother is supposed to come over a look at our sofas and possibly take them because we got a cool new 60s turquoise and green floral sofa and matching chair and they're smaller than the overstuffed furniture we had, so they'll make the room look better, and they go nice with our 60s kitchen. Also tonight, I'm supposed to meet with Steve Vocal to get him some video footage we took of Lindy in the Park for the TV show we have on public access now. I think tonight too, if Tim doesn't want the couch and chair from the apartment, we need to get those out to the dumpster and then go visit Just Dance to take a look at the sofa I've got over there. Ron's been wanting it out of there for months now, so he'll be pleased to see it go. I think there's probably something else I'm supposed to be doing tonight, but I just can't think of what it is. I know tomorrow I work at Old Navy, and Wednesday we start our Metro class at the American Legion, and Thursday we'll be going to see Big Bad Voodoo Daddy (man, it's been  years ). Then we'll be going to Maggie McCall's for Brian's blues jam, because on Friday, he's leaving for Chicago for a whole year. Friday we've got the dance, but Lindsay wants to go to Des Moines to compete in a dance contest and win a trip to Camp Hollywood this fall. It's tempting, but I do hate missing the dance especially when we've just missed it two weeks ago.

      So, I missed Jitterbugs' Night Out last week. I'm anxious to return. I really do enjoy being there, doing that.   Also, I've been thinking about the Jamborama schedule for this fall. In cleveland Marty said that they didn't do as much on Friday because they didn't think everybody would take the extra day off of work to attend. Well, at our event, everyone has an extra day off work. It's monday and as the prospective schedule stands we do nothing on that day. Why? What if we ran our event into and through Monday, possibly instaed of Friday or in addition to? Just a thought. I'll play with the idea this weekend and hopefully some important conclusions can be made.   I turned in my fomrs to be switched to Wee-staff. Wee-hoo. (sarcasm). Oh, and I also gave blood today. I'm a Type O Hero. Well, I gotta go get things ready for JNO. See ya later!

      I submitted my new availability to Old Navy. Tuesdays from 6:30pm-close. (which was quarter to 11 last night. yuck!) I decided to stay and keep the extra money that I get from working once a week, just in case the Ameritrade thing never fully pans out the way I'd like it to. Plus I get to keep the discount, not like I ever use it, but I think I make 60 bucks or so every couple of weeks, which really kinda sucks, but hey, I can use an extra $120 bucks every month for such a little amount of work.

      So, in trying to set up the rest of the Jamborama info, I'm really struggling. I'm considering re-vamping the entire weekend schedule, but I'm having the darndest time organizing it in a creative yet appealing way pleasing both the instructors, by giving them many teaching opportunities, and the students, by not overwhelming them with classes, and arranging the classes so as not to alienate any one group. I want to include revolutionary new ideas into the schedule and into the classes to make Jamborama really stand out, but I'm not quite sure how to fit it all together. I think we'll have it all worked out by this weekend though.

      Ameritrade has a big outdoor picnic thing today patting themselves on the back for being the first online brokerage with a call center that's been certified by J.D. Powers & Associates. While I was sitting there in the Ameritrade parking lot eating my BBQ, watching the managers and my fellow associates drink beer on the clock, listening to local blues band "Blues House" playing live, I thought about how it'd be fun to have Lindsay here if things hadn't worked out as they did with her stranded at work without a car. I then thought that if she were here we'd probably dance, and how then people would make a fuss, and wonder if we both worked here, and then upon finding out that she didn't, wonder what she was doing at the event because we weren't invited to bring a friend to the festivites.  All my friends are like that, always calling unnecessary attention to themselves. Being dancers, none of them them are low profile. If they were all there, they'd all dance, all get questioned as to why they were there and then ultimately take heat and maybe even get kicked out of the "private party"

      So it seems like I'll never be hired on full time by Ameritrade. I've worked for Ameritrade through a staffing company called "Noll" since the beginning of February. They had a contract that I needed to work a certain number of hours through the staffing company before Ameritrade could opt to hire me outright and I could begin to get healh care and bonuses and 401K and all that good stuff through the company. Well those hours are long passed. I've worked twice that number through the staffing company, and now Ameritrade is consolodating the three staffing companies they were working with to find employees and transferring all the "temps" to one company called "Westaff" pronounced West-aff, not We-staff.  Anyhow, when I was out of town, I was supposed to turn in paperwork to be transferred to this other agency. I was contacted yesterday saying I needed to have the paperwork in by today at the latest. Then I left the forms at home today. I'm not really excited about this transfer. I'd much rather be hired on by Ameritrade. I'm frustrated by the delay and total lack of communication as to a possible timeframe that I can anticipate the rollover to happen within.

      So, I had to work until 10 last night, and the same tonight and Thursday night. I called in today to speak with the GM to explore my options as far as quitting goes, but she's not available. I instead requested that I not work next Wed or Thurs. Wednesday is our new class at Metro and Thursday is Brian's last night in town. We'll see how that goes. I may end up just working every tuesday. I guess that wouldn't be so bad.

      Lindsay is so wonderful. God bless her. Today she left a message on my phone saying that I have her car keys. Last night she rode her bike over to Nate's house. Then I went a picked her up and she left her bike there because the two of them are planning on riding together later this week. So the message said that I have her car keys and so she's walking to work. I called her back and sure enough, she's walking to work. I run out to my car to see if I have her bag with her keys in it and I do not. She could have driven. The keys are somewhere in the apartment. But at this point she's already walked to 78th and Dodge, which is still quite a ways from work, but is not close enough to the apartment to really warrant turning back. She had even called work and spoke with one of the asshole supervisors there and he asked if she needed a ride, and she told him that would be nice, and he asked where she was. She told him where we lived, and he said, "Well that's close enough, you can walk." It's like two miles! (according to MapQuest it's 3.29 mi) If it's "close enough," why can't he get in his car and come get her, jerk! I feel so bad for her. I wanted to leave work and go pick her up, but I'm all the way down in Bellevue, by the time I'd get there, she'd be to work already. I love her so much, I don't want her to have to walk to work. Poor Lindsay.

      I totally missed Father's Day yesterday. I only now realized that it was by looking at my calendar to see how nay days until "national chocolate pudding day." How sad. I'll have to maybe do something special for the old man. I'm thinking I may have missed his birthday too. I know it's always within a week of Father's day.

      Sunday was a long day. After checking out of the hotel, we ate the rest of our chocolate cake at the "Balboa Brunch" and then had another great workshop with Jason & Sylvia. We then had KFC for lunch  (I had a pound of mashed potatoes and some cole slaw) and then goofed around in the hall during the last two workshops and then hit the road. About 10 hours later we pulled up in Omaha. I think we were driving a bit fast. We got in around 4am.

      Today's workshops were pretty good. I especiallly liked the material from Jason & Sylvia.  I really enjoy her, and I appreciate that Jason is willing to take his time and answer questions throroughly. We ate our chocolate cake for lunch along with free cans of red bull that we were given, and also smirnoff ice that I bought from the bar. After lunch I got sick to my stomach and went to the bathroom for a private "Explosive Bal Movement" session and then laid down for a nap on the steps. I felt better after that. For dinner we went to a place called the Cleveland Chophouse. It was expensive but neat. It was a brewery and the beer was good. The appetizers of Onion Rings were impressive. I got a burger and mashed potatoes and only ate half of my meal. Lindsay got the same and did the same. We ought to have shared. The dance was neat. The contest was a lot of fun. We didn't compete, and I'm glad we didn't.  Boy those dancers are good. Maybe in a year's time we can get ourselves really good and maybe even be able to hold our own in a contest like that.

      Today we went to Bob Evan's for breakfast and ate with a French guy from Pittsburgh named Francois. We decided that tomorrow for "lunch" we'll bring a chocolate cake from Bob Evans. We went to a Charleston workshop with Nick and Denise from Los Angeles that was pretty cool, and then a really neat workshop with Randy & Kara from San Francisco that just covered the Balboa basics ("pure bal" as they called it). It seems like at this workshops the Friday was really not a "part of the weekend" they even said that had they known so many people would skip work on Friday to come, they'd have done more. For dinner we went to a restaurant called "Hoggies" and got two big plates of meat, and a big thing of ice cream for dessert! Yum Yum! Oink Oink!   The evening dance was cool too. Lots of great Balboa dancers. They had an "invitational" jack and jill with all the instructors plus others competing, which is a great idea because it gives the instructors a chance to show off, as well as gives more footage for the video.

      Ray Charles died today. I saw it coming. It was on the cover of a tabloid magazine in the checkout lane of the grocery store about a month ago that he was in poor health and dying. His music will live on forever, and will be celebrated by generations to come. The name genius was not inappropriately used when referring to him and his music. Thank you Ray. God bless.

      Lindsay, Brian, Sharon and I drove all night and arrived at Cedar Point around 11am. It rained. Hard. The gal at the gate said the park was open, however individual rides may be closed. We decided against going in, because we weren't about to give them our money but not get to ride the rides. We stopped and had pizza at Chet & Matt's Pizza in Schenectady, and then drove the rest of the way to Cleveland, went swimming at the hotel (in my underwear) and then Wendy's drive through and then dancing at the Spy Bar (in my clothes).

      got a call from Lisa at Noll today telling me that Ameritrade wanted to know where I was. I called in sick yesterday and I have vacation starting today. We leave for Cleveland this evening. I probably could have worked both yesterday and today, but I really didn't want to. Plus having a cold and being on the phone just sucks.   I heard from Brian that Christy may be moving to Hawaii permanantly come December.

      Today I'm home sick from work. I hate being sick. I was sick at work yesteday and it sucked. I just want to be well. I don't want to take a trip and be sick in the car or at the Balboa camp.   I heard through the grape vine that today christy comes home. Nate's picking her up from the airport this morning. It'll be weird having her back in town. I really wasn't expecting her back so soon.

      I'm still thinking of how to use  urlLink edgecraft  at  urlLink Cowtown Jamborama . How to make ourselves stand out not just by being different, but by being better than the other camps that are out there. People are always offering camps that are just a bunch of workshops and dances. Exchanges were successful because they took the emphasis away from the workshops and eliminated the cost of instructors so they could charge less for a weekend package. Contest weekends are neat because they put the emphasis not on the workshops or the social dancing, but instead on the contests. So... What if you put the emphasis on the fourth element of each of these events, the unspoken one. We've got contests, we've got dancing, we've got workshops, and we've got a community, we've got fun. That intangible "good time." How do we make that the focus of our event.. our focus is to include everyone and have a blast, meanwhile encouraging attendees to form friendship and potentially lasting relationships with other camp goers. Also, we need to come up with a way to get the instructors more involved in the planning of the camp, which is something they aren't used to. We need to change the whole process of making the camp. The instructors should be invited/required to participate in roundtable discussions even online or by phone to talk about the camp. The facilitator or moderator will set the guidelines of the conversation and the goals to be reached or decisions to be made and then set the ideals forward and let the instructors help create the event. Then they're more likely and able to take some ownership in the event, which makes them enjoy it more, participate more, and promote it more. We choose our instructors based on who is willing to participate in this way.

      I've got a cold. My throat hurts. I'm here at work. I'm kinda proud of myself that I worked the whole day without going home. I'm eating DayQyill like Candy though, and my nose is all runny. I'm tired too. I can't believe Lindsay is working three 12-hour days this week. That's completely insane. She's been getting sick too. I can't believe the drive of that girl. This Wednesday night we leave for Cleveland. Thursday we get to ride the roller coasters at  urlLink Cedar Point , and then Friday-Sunday, We'll be at the  urlLink All-Balboa Weekend .

      So, today is Lindsay's Birthday. I have a weird way of thinking in my head how things should be and having expectations about how it should go and how the people around me should behave and respond. When that doesn't happen, I respond not in a flexible easy-going sort of way, but in a childish inconsiderate sort of way. So, I need to start thinking instead about the other individuals involved instead of myself. Is  she  having fun? Is  she  happy? If so, then there's no reason to fuss that everything didn't go according to your plan? I need to get over my own need to have my ego needs met in every situation. That really gets in the way of truly being happy. True happiness is found in surrounding yourself with wonderful people and then doing everything you can to make those people happy. I've done the first part. I don't think there's a person in the world more wonderful that Lindsay. As for the second part, I don't know what my problem is. I think it something I've inherited from my father. I don't think he knows how to make my mom happy. If you ask him he'll tell you that's what he wants to do, but he never figured out how to do it, or if he did figure it out, he just stopped doing it. I don't want to be in that situation with Lindsay, ever. I have no reason no to do for her when she wants me to. It's not like there's a million times a week, or day even that she does for me without question, without prompt, without thanks even. I love her to pieces. Happy Birthday Linds.

      I'm not quite sure what to do for Lindsay's Birthday. For mine, she had our friends come over and cook dinner while we were teaching dance class. Then we all ate and had a merry ol' time. She had wanted to have a big group of people go down to the riverfront to watch a blues band, but the show is on Friday, not Saturday when her party should be. Hopefully I come up with something awesome.

      I was thinking this morning about how bad drinking is.. and I was thinking of giving it up. I'm not going to make a hard rule about it, but when I have the choice, either to have a drink or not to.. I'll choose not to, unless I choose to. I think that'll be good. I've found that I really am not a huge fan of alcohol. Plus, I'm not a fan of getting fat, and I think that my father's proportions were caused by years of accelerated alcohol intake, and I'd prefer to avoid all that. I've been doing Pilates now four times a week for the past two weeks. I feel quite good about that. It's actually getting easier, which is reassuring. I'd like to get super fit and flexible, and stay that way throughout my adulthood. I'm still 15 lbs overweight, which sucks, but I think I'm on my way to resolving that.

      Apperantly next week the head of the department is meeting with all the agency associates to talk about where we're headed as far as being an ameritrade associate is concerned. It'll be nice if I get the job. I need the health insurance, and the PFP (Paid for performance) would be nice to get into before the results of this whole J.D. Powers Survey comes about. Ameritrade is trying to place in the top three online , and if we do, we get mad paid it sounds like. Well, I've gotta run, I'm taking the rest of the day off to go spend time with Lindsay.

      So, Lindsay has updated her  urlLink blog  once again. She's seemed so motivated lately. I love that about her. She's been riding her bike to and from work each day. She's been on top of getting promotion done for Cowtown. She's bought some brainstorming books and some information on starting up our own organization seperate from Omaha Jitterbugs for working with youth. I hope she keeps up with her blog.  urlLink Monica  doesn't update her's nearly often enough. Neither does  urlLink Greg , or  urlLink Michael . Or even  urlLink Seth  for that matter. (I really shouldn't say that about Seth's blog. He updates almost every day.. it's just that I check it often three times or more each day). I don't think that  urlLink Nate ,  urlLink Josie , or  urlLink Christy  have even written once in theirs.

      I need to check with UNO and Creighton both to see how long it would take for me to graduate from each respective school. If at Creighton it takes only 18hours, I could do that in one semester. I'd need to raise $7500 though. eeek. I'd also need to hold down a full time job while going so that I can pay for rent and all those other important things. Maybe if someone would just give me $10,000 then I can go for one semester, pay for rent, pay for school, graduate and be done with the whole thing. Otherwise, my fear is (and this is probably the actual way it will happen) that I'll have to go part time in the evenings for the next two or three years until I'm through. I want a degree in Communications. I also want a teaching certificate and a Master's degree. One step at a time.

      I ran into Jennifer Jerome last night at Old Navy. She's the speech coach at Millard West High School, and was my speech coach my Jr. & Sr. year of High School when I was a Gross. If you judge a high school speech tournament(ususally on a Friday night or Saturday day), you get $50. Not a bad deal.. I mean, i could make more money hourly-wise doing other things, but seriously, that's easy work. It's entertaining. It keeps my mind doing creative things and it keeps me connected with important communicators throughout the city. I'm definitely going to try and judge a few this year, and maybe even use this connection to see about launching the Hep Hop idea through speech kids.

      So, I was talking with Nate the other day, and then again with Andy last night, hashing around that idea that in order for Omaha Jitterbugs to survive, I have to let it go.. but not only do I have to let it go, I have to convince the others that are attached to it to also let it go. Then we hand it off to people more motivated than ourselves, and change our roles to simply workers, teachers, advisors, but not decision makers or organizers. If we all resign smultaneously after having devised a plan to let the organization smoothly transfer hands, and think about the long term of what needs to happen organizationally in order for this to be functioning still in ten years or twenty years after we've moved on. The reason for all of this suddenly (well actually not suddenly, one of my first posts touches of this very frustration) is because the current combinations of people cannot make this organization work. There is no willingness from the members to follow any one person and recognize that person as the leader. Without that, there is no direction and nothing can happen. We're at a gridlock. As it stands right now, the dynamic of the group functions in such a way that every single item of business that comes up is changed and manipulated or shot down for no good reason. When new ideas come up, even if they are agreed upon, no actual action takes place. The members actively discourage people from helping out. Our elitism alienates our customer base, which is really our friends, our peers. Once they are alienated, they don't come any more. In order to increase the quality and size of our events, we need to include as many people as possible and make them feel helpful, by letting them participate. Their participation, will add value for future customers, through them giving their time, ideas, connections, skills to our cause (which is now their cause). We've planted a seed, and now it is time to let it grow. The problem now is that we can get help, but we don't let anyone have ownership. We have too many control freaks on staff. Nobody wants to be a lackey who just does as they are told. Make someone feel important by giving them ownership over something. Then they take control of the project and are willing to put in amazing amounts of time and energy and even money into making this thing happen. It's remarkable. Well, my plan will take this to the extreme. The people in charge will instantly have total control over the whole operation and begin to utilize their own resources, as well as ours to make the Omaha Jitterbugs better that it's ever been in the past.

      So, I was at Office Depot yesterday buying packing tape and sharpies to give to my sister, Maggie, at ther "box party." She and Anna are moving. Anyhow, a woman at the other register had two of  urlLink these  and was pricing them with a price gun. Thinking that maybe they'd been returned, and that I could get a significant discount, I curiously peer over to see what she's doing, and she asked, "you want one of these."  "Maybe," I reply. "How much are they?"  Then get this. She says, "They're 50% off the ticketed price of $150.00."  "I'll take both," I quickly answered.  So, now I've got two external 200 GB hard drives that I'm not sure what I'm going to do with. They're going for around $200 on Ebay.

      Lindsay and I practiced the California Routine last night. We're getting good at the tricks. We weren't too bad with the actual routine either. We're performing at some event for Marty Hebert on Saturday. We hope to build a bunch of interest for Cowtown by doing this. I love Lindsay. She's so good to me. I've never felt so connected or in tune with any other individual in my entire life. It's like a no-brainer to be with her. There is no choice, there is no hesitation or doubt. It's just so obvious. Lindsay is my number one, and it's clear that that's not about to change. We're like peanut butter and jelly. Mmmmmm....jelly.

      I don't know if I'm going to buy that Ford from my dad that he bought from Jamie. He got something on it fixed and now it runs okay. I still wouldn't feel safe taking it on road trips, becuase it shakes over 60. We're going to take it in to Don, Lindsay's mechanic in Council Bluffs. Lindsay says he's really a good judge of whether a car is going to last or not, and has a great track record for recommending to buy or not to buy a car.

      So I got the prices today for the Jamborama flyers 1500 flyers/posters for $853 2500 flyers/posters for $943 3000 flyers/posters for $973  Last year we got 3000, and we had a bunch of flyers left at the end. We got them late, and didn't put any out in the city of Omaha because our only target audience was people who swing dance. My feeling is that this year, since it is targeted not only at dancers, but at people who do not yet dance, and people who like corn, we can put the posters up city-wide and flyer the city mercilessly. This is our only form of advertisement. We don't do radio, we don't do newspapers, we don't do TV. All we have is this plus press releases for radio and newspaper. TV may come to cover the event again, as it happens, but are not likely to cover it before it happens. The problem is, she has the power to prove me wrong either way. If we get fewer, and we use them all, to her that is successful because there are no extras. If we get more, and she doesn't want me to be right, since I am at work, and she has the opportunity to distribute the flyers, if she does not, then I am wrong for having gotten too many and wasting money. I know that she will deny the deliberate attempt to sabotage anyone or anything, but it's not in her nature to champion a cause that is not her own, either. So, I think what I will do is this. I will buy the 3000 flyers/posters again. I will deliver to Omaha Jitterbugs 1500 as they would like, and then I will pay for the difference ($120) for the last 1500 flyers. I will then make it my mission to distribute every last one of them in the city of Omaha. I think it can be done. I am willing to do this because I believe it should be done, and because I think that ultimately, having that extra promotion, at such a relatively small cost is definitley worth every penny and will make this event successful.

      So, I was reading back through some of my old posts that I once thought to be inspiring, because I thought to myself that there must be a real wealth of knowledge hidden there, that I may not have fully actualized. It turns out that a lot of my old posts are crap. Many are filled with bitter resentment and pettiness. I think that now that I actually have readers and word may travel to people whose names I mentioned in those posts, that it may be time to gently edit some of my previous comments so as to make them more positive, or at least less combatative. I may also erase some of the ignorance written into the statements. And possibly add some spark or vivality to the entries. Is that wrong? Is that dishonest? I think it will cause more good in the long run. I hate the whole "end justifies the means" mentality that is so prevalent in today's world. I think of this as a correction to be more honest, rather than an effort to hide. A retrospective biting of the tongue, if you will. I don't see anything wrong with that.

      I am so infatuated with honesty. I wish that honesty were easy for everyone to do. We all put up barriers and are often emberassed of what we are or what we do, and therefore need to pretend that we are different or lie. For the longest time, and even still I am hesitant to offer the information that I am involved with swing dancing to the extent that I am to people that I meet outside of dance. I fear that it would seem ludicrus to them. I'm sure they are perfectly content with their vision of what swing dancing is, and I'm sure it involved zoot suits, and so I fear that if I tell them they'll know as little about what I actually do than they will if I offer no information at all. What this does though, is it makes me into my worst promoter. If I want us to succeed, I need to be proud of what I am doing and not be emberassed or ashamed or afraid of rejection or afraid of being misunderstood. I need to be big and assertive and clear and honest and happy about what I do. If I'm not, who do I expect will be? I don't mean to say immodesty is admirable, because I actually believe the contrary, but hiding in cowardess is equally shameful. I need to become a stonger person who is better able to stick up for myself. I am so afraid of confrontation, of potentially upsetting someone, or having someone not like me, that I back down, I don't speak up, I don't do what needs to be done. In the past I've tried to not fear confrontation, and I guess the reason I end up reverting to my former disposition is because I'm so bad at confrontation. I end up getting tempramental. Confrontation for me means a baby fight rather than a rational debate backed up with hard facts and delivered in a persuasive manner. I really would like to take some communications courses and learn to speak better. I want to learn to use what I've got to become a more effective presenter, speaker, interacter, teacher, leader.

      pretty busy today. 60 calls taken. Not bad. I need start setting goals. I love that Lindsay was so excited about the movie idea, and the teens club idea. We need to meet and establish goals and make things happen. I don't want to be at Ameritrade a year from now. I want to have done things that change my situation and make me able to go out and live my life the way I want to live it. I want to make a difference. This is not the place or position to do that in.

      Another slow day at Ameritrade. The morning went really fast. Coming in late makes 11am just zoom up. Then lunch isn't too far after that. I get done eating and it's already 2pm, and 5:30 is quitting time. I was actually trying to go home early because Lindsay has the day off and I'd like to be with her, but on the other hand, I can sit here and do very little and get paid. I love Lindsay.

      I was late for work again this morning. By three minutes.&nbsp;Lindsay called into work today so she could get stuff done, including dropping the flyer off at Regal Printing. Well, I had changes to make still since Kevin Brian had found some typos yesterday and Maggie told me to change some things grammatically. So, I got it all fixed, but I'm not sure that everything is 100% okay, and I'm a&nbsp;bit nervous about sending lindsay over to Regal, but I guess I could give them a call later and talk with them about what needs to be done. She's also taking my C-PAP back in to the shop because mine is fixed, and they'd loaned me one to use while they looked at mine. As for being late, it only increases my fear level of being canned here at Ameritrade.

      So back a week or two ago when I wasn't able to post to my acct it was because I'd run out of web space. Cliff wants me to add photos to the site, and I want to too.&nbsp; I currently pay $167.40 a year to host jamborama's website plus $239.40 a year to host jitterbugs.org plust $6.95 a year for each domain name and aliais I have registered (jitterblogs.org, jitterblogs.com, jitterblogs.net, omahajitterbugs.com, omahajitterbugs.org, jamborama.com, jitterbugs.org) So the move from $400 a year for web hosting to begin paying $280 a month would have to be well worth the extra money, and I'm convinced that it wouldn't be. However I want to anyway. I want our own dedicated server,  urlLink which hostway now offers . I guess right now I get 400MB of disk space for jitterbugs.org. I'd like to have twice that or even more. I pay $20 a month for that.&nbsp; For $45 a month, you can get a gigabyte. I may have to take that route instead of the $280/month. I'll have to look into all this though when I've got more time and i'm not on my lunch break at work.

      I ended up with a total of nine posts yesterday, and today I've got nearly nothing to say. Tomorrow is "Cow Appreciation Day" according to the hand made calendar that is hanging at my desk. Yesterday was "Puzzle Day" and Sunday the 18th is "National Ice Cream Day." Unfortunately I won't be having any national ice cream, what with my new diet and all. The caledar is probably a week off anyway like it was for Father's Day. "National Ice Cream Day" is probably really on the 25th.   I thought that in honor of this day, we should send out an email to our list about Cowtown Jamborama, and also post all over all the boards (even today) letting everyone know that if they sign up on the 15th of July, they get with their registration a free gift of some kind. Like  urlLink this  or  urlLink this .  Here's some other cow stuff I found: You can get  urlLink pens  at $2 each for 100, that have your name and website on them. I wonder if there's a place where you can find  urlLink these  in bulk.  I'm thinking this is a good idea, but what could we offer that we don't have to pay for? Sign up today and get:  1) a coupon for a discount to Jamborama 2005?  2) a coupon for a 20% discount off any Jamborama 2004 merchandise.  I'll have to get input/permission from the group and see what they think.

      Check this out.  urlLink Seth's Blog: Maybe you shouldn't ask . This is something I encounter all the time. When working with our group I am often told that we shouldn't do something because it is "unnecessary." or "too much work," or any other number of bad reasons not to do something. So I've begun to not ask. And here's what happens. I get people upset. Was it a bad idea to have t-shirts printed for the parade? no. Would I have been able to do it had I asked permission? probably not. Did I piss people off for not asking? yes. Same for the cameras. Their biggest argument is that it will cost money. The thing is, a lot of things cost money. The t-shirts we sold to people at the parade, so it was no big deal. The cameras are going to buy us so much publicity, that it will be well worth the $300 in film and later the $300 in developing.  So, sad to say, so long as things are set up the way they are where "permission" is needed to do anything great, I don't think we'll be doing many great things. Once I break free and do things independently where I can ask for help when I need it and empower people to do things on their own, but don't need to ask their permssion to make important big decisions, that's when amazing things will start to happen. Like the  urlLink movie idea . Like the  urlLink Hep Hop . Or even a  urlLink Cowtown Jamborama  that meets its full potential. Gotta go. It's quittin time.

      Yesterday I bought 96 disposable cameras for $3 each. I'm going to put instruction stickers on them and put them in the Cowtown Jamborama welcome packets. I bleive I wrote about doing this  urlLink once before , only now I've actually done it. Lindsay and I are really excited about these welcome packets. She wants to get  urlLink cow bells  to put in each one.

      Okay, I know this is my 7th post today. WOW! (another slow day at Ameritrade) but I just wanted to say hi to my brother-in-law, Greg who found this page through Google. I just want to say to him and others that are reading this: If you read this post something. Somewhere. Say hi. Otherwise, for me, I'm writing to the great abyss, knowing that Lindsay will probably check this once a week or so and catch up on what I've been doing, but otherwise I assume that nobody is out there. So, go ahead and make my day. Post a comment.

      I'm not crazy, but in 74 days I think I could run a 10K. (there's no way I'd do a full marathon that soon, or ever for that matter, but 10K.. that's doable... possibly farther than I've ever run in the past, but the training would be fantastic exercise and just to have done it would be wonderful.

      I need to get some new shoes. I want to get a couple of pairs of Sperry Loafers.  urlLink These  are the ones I always wear around. I'd like to also maybe get a  urlLink lighter  or  urlLink white  pair and get them chromed. I also have to get some running shoes. There are those  urlLink boing  shoes from Nike that are pretty cool, but I really don't know what shoes are going to be best for me. I tried the  urlLink shoe finder  at Runner's World, but the darn thing wouldn't work for me.

      Okay, so I was looking back through my posts over the last week and all of them but the ones today were about being gassy, or nautious, or having the runs, or pooping, or puking, or just feeling ill. I don't think that's necessarily a positive thing. On Saturday though, having just recovered from my colon blow, I weighed only 190. That's well on my way to my target weight of 160. I'd actually be content with 175. I still haven't started running. I want some running shoes. We should start pilates again though. Next monday we start again. This week in the mornings, I have a bunch of errands to run.

      Lindsay and I are thinking of starting a movie night.  Once a week we'll air a movie. We'll invite over anyone who wants to come. We'll charge admission only to raise money to buy more movies and to buy equipment to move it to a larger space, like the Eagles. Then eventually, when we have all the equipment we need, we'll start showing the movies in the park, once a week. We can sell concessions. We'll have to figure out what to do as far as rights to airing the movies goes.

      While I was home sick on Friday, I read  urlLink Steh Godin's  Book  urlLink The Big Red Fez . It gave me a lot of ideas for the  urlLink website . I need to think about what I want people do do when they get there and make that the most prominant thing people see. The front page should have all the info someone who's never heard of us before or is just learning about us will need.   Why swing dancing? Where can I learn? FAQ. Sign up for mailing list.  When someone does sign up, send them an email coupon for free admission to a dance or a discount on lessons. We should at least a few times a year include a coupon on our email to reward those who listen to us and read our news.  The forum and other features are not of immediate interest to new users. We can then create another page with all the info that a seasoned user will need, possibly after a login page.  I'd like to have a photo page, I'd like to have it integrated with www.ofoto.com so that users can order prints at any time. I'd also like users to be able to add their own captions and add their own photos.  FAQ should include answers to questions on music to practice to, what to wear, dance floor etiquitte.  I'd like to integrate the forum into the site more. I'd like to let people create a user ID that will let them access the forum, subscribe and unsubscribe themselves to the email or snail mail list and update their contact information.   Most importantly. I'd like to redesign the whole page so it's quick to load, easy to use, and HTML.

      So, I've got the Jamborama flyer all done. It's ready to go to print. When I announced this last night via email, instead of getting a congratulatory response or a pat on the back, I got a frantic response of panic that it was going to print without the final okay of each individual person. Talk about control issues. So, I didn't take it to print today. I work until 10pm tonight at Old Navy and will take it to print tomorrow morning. I don't know if this will make a difference, but the next meeting hasn't even been scheduled and I don't know if there is time for everyone to give the thumbs up before we print the thing. It does look really cool though.

      Okay, so apparently. What I did to myself on Friday is called a Colon Blow. I ate a lot of fiber with psyllium. I pooped all afternoon, and I'd drank so much water that it came out like a faucet. I stayed home from Jitterbugs Night Out that night, and also tried to fix my problem with some Pepto, to no avail. I felt better by Saturday when we had our meeting in the morning were I ate a low carb bagel and then our class in the afternoon and Troy and Merinda's party after that where I ate a hamburger and a few sausages with no bread and a strawberry margarita. On Sunday we started Lindy in the park, then went to Nathan's birthday party where I had some beef briscut and a deviled egg, and then went to the festival at church where I ate an Italian sausage and peppers with no bun and a few bites of a turkey leg that I couldn't finish, and a bottle of DOC's hard lemonade. We then went to el Augila on 18th & Vinton with Rose Ann and her friends and Lindsay and I split a 64 oz Margarita on the rocks, and after that was gone, had a second one. It was so much fluid, it made my stomach hurt to stretch that big. We went to see They Might Be Giants whom I've never seen in concert before even though I've been a fan for over 10 years. We got to the show and shortly thereafter I headed to the restroom, I sat on the pot for a while, letting out a small amount of poo, and then as I wiped and arose realized that I needed to vomit. I threw up four times, and I wasn't on my knees. I got puke all over the place, most landed in the toilet though. After that I wiped off the toilet seat and sat down again for some more liquid pooping, and then resolved that I wasn't going to have any more progress in there so I might as well go see the show. I had the worst stomach ache of my life and as the cramps increased in severity, I realized it was gas. It was the worst gas cramps ever as the air moved its way from my upper stomach to my lower stomach. So we left. We'd paid nearly $50 for our tickets and we just left. They Might Be Giants were playing and we left. We drove home and it felt so good to lay down, have some pepto and some water and the farts moved so much more easily, and they were big and loud and surprisingly not stinky. We fell asleep watching "All About Eve." When I woke up this morning, my stomach was all but settled. I decided not to go to work today, because I really don't feel better, and because I have plenty to get done here. If I can finish up the Jamborama flyer and get it to print, then I'll feel really good about today's progress.

      So I ate a half of a subway Atkin's-approved wrap. Very tasty. Still feel sick though. I thought I was feeling better for a bit.. It felt good to eat it, but now that I'm not eating it anymore, I feel sick, and now I've got the hiccups. I've almost worked a full hour now, which involved taking a total of four 4 1/2 minute phone calls. I wonder how long before I get fired, seeing how it's obvious that our department is over-staffed, and I'm one of the easiest people to eliminate since I'm not even employed by Ameritrade. Monday was such a great day. Lindsay and I stayed in bed til 1pm. I love her. It's comorting to know that I'll never again have to look for that one person, that special someone. I'll always know right where she is. She's in a picture frame on my desk at work. She makes me smile.  I'm leaving work now. I'm definitely gonna barf.

      So, I ate breakfast. I had a bowl of  urlLink Kellogg's All-Bran Bran Buds . It was gross. Then I felt like vomiting. I laid down. I called in to work. I found myself feeling a bit better and told my manager that I'd go ahead and come in, even though I felt like crap. So, here I am. I've taken only two calls in the first 20 minutes of being here, and I still feel extra vomitous.

      I have some awful gas right now. Downright emberassing. I'm thinking through what I've eaten:   Today: Bran cereal, Skim milk, Lettuce, Spinach, Meat, cheese, water Yesterday: Lettuce, Spinach, Broccoli, Meat, cheese, water  Tuesday: Lettuce, Meat, Water, Broccoli  So maybe it's not from Broccoli, maybe it's the spinach, or the meat, or the cheese, or the cereal. Whatever it is... Boy howdy! Steeen-Keee!  I wish Lindsay were here.

      So, Christy's being all angry about the Jamborama Schedule. We didn't have one made, and then when she came up with on and submitted it for approval, I reviewed it made a bunch of changes, or alternate ideas, thinking that we could all get together and decide what we like. This makes her bad because this should have been done a long time ago and we never agreed on this or that, and there's nothing wrong with the one she created, and why do I always need to change everything. I look forward to our meeting on Saturday.

      On Friday, Dillon Emerson from Denver called me to say that he reads my Blog. In college, he lived down the hall from me on Kiewit's 6th floor and used to beat the hell out of the 4th floor restroom. We went on a trip together that spring to visit Florida's Golden Coast, and we made fun of the pelicans. Once he borrowed my deoderant, (Mitchum, so effective you could even skip a day) and it gave him a terrible burning rash. Once he got in trouble for throwing large heavy objects from the 6th story window. He's a pilot now.

      NPR's morning edition did a  urlLink nice story  yesterday morning about the roots of Rock n Roll and how it evolved, and the difference between black rock and roll and white rock and roll. The story combats the widely held belief that Elvis was the birth of rock and roll in 1954 (thus this being the 50th anniversary of rock and roll). They tell how it actually began much earlier than that and it's hard to pin point exactally when, because it's hard to say what is or is not rock and roll.  This topic has been one of intense intrest to me for years now, having explored artists like Hank Williams, Billy Jack Wills, Bill Haley, Wynonie Harris, Louis Jordan, and many others all as possible creators of rock and roll, and read books like  urlLink Unsung Heroes of Rock 'N' Roll : The Birth of Rock in the Wild Years Before Elvis ,  urlLink Lone Star Swing : On the Trail of Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys , and  urlLink Country : The Twisted Roots of Rock 'N' Roll .

      So, tonight we go to Jazz on the Green at the Joslyn, and then drive down to Lincoln with Troy and Merinda to go dancing at the Pla Mor Ballroom where Nate and Josie are teaching a beginning lesson for their monthly swing dance. We'll dance there until midnight and then go to Troy's parent's house and enjoy their hot tub. We'll sleep for a while and drive to Denver to see Dan & Tiff. We'll hang out Friday night (I should call Dillon Emerson) and then we'll teach some Balboa and Bal-Swing. Then on Sunday we will drive home and go to work on Monday. Twill be fun. I look forward to seeing Dan and Tiff once again. (p.s. I truly am quite excited for Jamborama.)

      First off, I must say that I'm getting very excited about jamborama. We have nearly 40 registratns and this is even before we've sent out our main mailer to our snail mail list.  Second off, I'm troubled. I understand that my feelings on this issue are selfish, and unfounded. I cannot expect things of people who never promised anything. I cannot be disappointed if certain people don't come to our events, especially when I was expecting them to come as a customer, not even a staff member. Such is the case with Monica. I was excited to have her involved with the Creighton Dance Club because in her I saw a lot of excitment and enthusiasm for dancing. An energy that is sorely lacking in our scene. And she's contageous to boot (and I'm not talking about her  urlLink pharyngitis ). In her, I see a new hope for the Omaha dance scene (as for as involment and organizers go.) Without prompting from the dance club at all, I'd already mentally committed hours of service to get the geared up and prepared for a productive year full of promoting swing and planning fun cool events. Now, I've found out that this person in whom I'd put so much faith, not that she asked for it or even wanted it, has now announced that since she has a boyfriend now, she'll be leaving Omaha the weekend of Jamborama to go see a Dave Matthews Concert. I probably shouldn't write this because she might read it, and if she does, I don't want her to feel guilty, and stay home because of that, but I do want her to stay in Omaha for the event. I want her to tell that boyfriend that if he doesn't want to come visit her and meet her friends that are important to her, then he must not truly love her, and a person who is afraid of being 'forced to dance' is not the type of person that a free spirit like herself should be chained down to. I want to support her, because i understand that soon she will find herself drowning in her new relationship, and she'll need some friends to help her and support her. Even friends who feel a bit dejected. I'm sorry Monica for my mean words. We love you and support you. Have fun with the band.

      I'm feeling good today. Much better than before. I think I'm going to get the job. Today I was taken out to Lunch by the head of the department because of a customer compliment I received months ago. Also I also had the highest cumulative QE (quality) for my entire team for the month of July. Also the gal who got the second highest has taken a job somewhere else, and so that's one more person our department is losing. With her gone and Rick gone, there's now two empty seats in our row, so I don't have to worry about getting laid off just so someone else can sit in my desk. Also, I don't think they'd have just taken me to lunch if they were going to lay me off. I do like this job. I think I could work here until I finish school. Finish school. Now there's a thought. I'm thinking of going back to Creighton. Last I checked, I had only 18 hours left before graduation. So.. I was thinking I could do one class per semester fall, spring, summer x 2 years, and get myself done graduated.

      Okay, so I cheated. A lot. Saturday I had alcohol in large quantaties plus I had some tortilla chips. I also had ice cream on Friday. Sunday I had a big plate of Spaghetti from Spaghetti Works, and a piece of garlic bread. It's hard for me to start bending the rules even a little bit without going overboard. Today was donut day at Ameritrade. Last month I didn't eat even one.. This morning I had three. I will go back to the diet hard core starting now. I will include fruit, which I had cut out before. and I will exercise. I think we need to begin the pilates again. We'll wait until I pick up the contour from Don's so Lindsay doesn't have to ride her bike to work if she doesn't want to, and then we'll do Pilates four times a week. I still can't afford running shoes, so I think I'll just have to use Pilates, or maybe buy a jump rope or something.
