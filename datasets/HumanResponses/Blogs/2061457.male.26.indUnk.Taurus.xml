      My family and I flew out to Boston, for my brothers wedding reception. Well, actually, the reception was in Vermont, but we decided to fly out a few days earlier and visit Boston and New York city.

       urlLink    I'm going camping this weekend and so I set my tent up to air it out. I think I might sleep outside tonight. It's kinda' hot out: 85 degrees. But, I think that'll make tonight very pleasant. The tent is a "Greatland" from Target (I love Target). This tent is so cool. Not because it's mine (though that helps '_'), but because it's designed well. You enter the front which is a screened in porch. From there you can take your shoes off and step into the sleeping quarters. This setup is great because by taking your shoes off outside you don't get all sorts of dirt and crap on the floor. So, now I'm living the highlife! When I camp I camp in style! :)  Okay, this isn't actually my new Townhouse. I'll post some pictures of my house once my furniture arrives.

       urlLink    This is kind of random. I bought a Dyson vacuum a couple weeks ago for my new place and I love it so much. I don't particularly love vacuuming, but aside from that, this machine is friggin' awesome. The suction power is great, which I need because my carpet is really plush, and the extending hose and attachments are so convenient and well designed. Plus, this thing looks SO COOL! I get babes to come to my house just by telling them I have a Dyson. I usually can get them to vacuum a level for me under the guise of a "test run," its beautiful (both the strategy and the machine, the ladies aren't bad, either).  Ladies, shoot me an email if you'd like to give the beast a test drive.  Chauvinistic? Hey, At least I vacuum (sometimes). :)  Truth be told, I don't vacuum a ton, cause I also have a Roomba (robot vacuum) - which I also love (look for comments on that machine soon).  Okay, now I'm bordering on having a cleaning OCD, huh?

       urlLink    Here's my brother riding a bike my dad just bought. It's a Honda NSR-50. It's a scaled down crotch-rocket. It's super fun. Color wise it's nothing too beautiful, but that's because these are meant to be racing bikes and I guess Honda figures that the racers will want to give their machine custom graphic. This little baby will reach speeds of around 40 (I think), has 6 gears, and will reach 11,000 RPM's. It sounds great. For me, it's a fun little toy to tide me over until I get a full-sized motorcycle. Which I hope will be within the next couple weeks.

      Well, things have been really good for me over these last few weeks.  1) I closed on my townhouse and moved in. I've been organizing and buying crap to make it look more like a home. I'll try to post pictures as soon as I get my furniture moved in and looking nice.  2) Next on my list of good things: I bought out the car I was leasing. I've been leasing it for the past ~2 years and I liked it so much that I figure that I'll keep it longer. I might post picture eventually.  3) I completed my first triathlon for the year. This has been the third year that I've been competing in organized events. I've been doing "homemade" triathlons for the past 4-5 years. Anyway, I didn't do as well this year (compared to last year), but considering that I didn't really train at all this year, I didn't do too badly. Lengths: 1/2 mile swim, 13 mile bike, 3 mile run. Time: 1:35:15.

       urlLink    Oh, he will kill me if he finds out I'm posting this picture. My uncle was riding a little mini-dirt bike and he must have cornered too hard. He heard everybody laughing and played it up a little, so the vertical legs are extra. Nevertheless, he fell off - and that's something you don't see everyday with my Uncle. (Just don't tell him you saw this, he'd have my head for breakfast.)

       urlLink    This was really funny. I was up visiting my cousins and little "Tank" was playing in the dirt. His uncle Dan was ridding a four-wheeler with mud flaps which would really kick the dirt up. Anyway, Uncle Dan drives up and kicks up some dirt to show everybody how cool the four-wheeler was. Then he tells little "Tank" to go stand behind him. Everybody watching says, "Oh no, Dan. Don't have him do that." To which Uncle Dan replies, "Hey, Tank go stand behind me." Little "Tank" listens to his Uncle and this is the picture I get. Just so you don't worry, he didn�t get hurt (which is probably why they call him "Tank").

       urlLink    My cousins wanted me to do their family pictures. I ended up taking about 200 pictures total. It was hard to get them all to smile and not blink. I was kind of nervous to take the pictures because I've never done family portraits before and with such a big group to start with... But, they either trusted me enough, or were just feeling cheap. I think they ended up looking pretty good. This is one of my favorites before any editing - there are a couple faces that I think I'll need to photoshop (by request).

       urlLink    We found a little rabbit nest out at my parents property. There were tons of these little guys. This wasn't the best picture, composition wise, but the others were either too blurry (because I had my camera set to auto-focus and the grass kept messing things up) or they were just sleeping. This one shows them sniffing around - since their eyes haven't opened yet.

      Okay, so I suppose this isn't really a poem. I mean it doesn't rhyme or anything, and there's really no rhythm, either. I suppose it's more of a "Famous Quote" kind of thing - minus the famous part (at least, at the moment). Oh, yeah, I'll be famous some day. But, it probably won't be from my writing skills. :)  You can be a runner but be too tired to walk. You can pray and feel like you aren't being heard. You can be educated and realize you don't know a thing. You can be beautiful but think you are uglier than everyone else. You can be where you want but think you should be somewhere else. You can be rich but not have enough to buy what's important to you. You can have the perfect family and think they don’t care. You can believe in God but wonder if He's really there. You can be surrounded by friends but feel all alone.

       urlLink    I was over at my cousin's house today and took this picture. I thought he looked nice so I figure I'd post 'em. I really liked the band of white around his neck and near the tip of his nose - it seems to pull the picture together. The lighting outside was difficult because it was so direct, but this picture seemed to benefit from the light since it highlights his throat, ear, and jaw muscles.

This picture was taken in an A &amp; W restaurant that we stopped at on our way down to my brothers wedding (which took place about 2-3 months ago). The lighting in the restaurant was really crappy (color wise), but in black and white it didn&#39;t look too shabby.

       urlLink    Well, I think I said I&#39;d post a picture of my car. So, here it is. Pretty cool, huh? Yeah, it&#39;s fast. It handles so well. (But, it&#39;s a Ferrari Enzo - so, what would you expect.) The problem with it is that when you drive it you have to make sure the road is completely flat. And, getting in is difficult - in fact, it&#39;s impossible (unless of course, you are under an inch tall). Okay, you&#39;ve got me. It&#39;s not my car. It&#39;s my brothers. Oh yeah, and it&#39;s a tiny remote control car (a Mini-Z). I did, however, take the picture (does that count for anything?)

       urlLink    I've been so busy lately running, biking, and swimming. I've got one more triathlon within three weeks. Here's a picture from a triathlon from 2002. I think that was the first year I did a competition. This is one of the only pictures I have - and it isn't very flattering (in my opinion). After the first few triathlons nobody really cares enough to come, watch, and take pictures (I can't blame them, I'd be bored too). I've uploaded this picture to show you that I actually do participate in triathlons - I mean, really, why would I make that up? (Sorry if you're offended by a half naked dude) :)

Not laugh in a "I'm-making-fun-of-you" type of way but rather, in a  "you-guys-are-halarious" type of way.    This is a picture from a month ago up at my cousins house. Dan's winning. Jon is on his tail. And, Mike is not looking so smooth (which, is unusual for Mike. If you know Mike, you know he's a smooth fellow).

       urlLink     My goal is to include in every post a picture. Mostly because whenever I go to someone's blog I get bored of reading - I like the pretty pictures! Yay!   Anyway, it's been awhile since I've posted anything. The reason for that is 1) I've been busy "working," 2) I need my time to play, and 3) I've been really busy studying for an Enrolled Agent exam I'm taking with my dad and brothers (and brother-in-law, and cousin(s)) in September. The EA exam is like the CPA of taxes. It's a two day test with a length of six hours per day. All on taxes (fun, huh? Actually, it kind of is). I guess the pass rate is super slim. Most people don't pass it the first time. I think one of the reasons is that there isn't a good school for it - at least not around here in Minnesota.   Okay, the picture above was taken about 3-4 months ago. There's a huge burn pile in the back of my parents property and it was time to light it up. It was really windy that day. The fire was burning like crazy. If there was a dry leaf within 20 feet it would just start on fire. It was pretty intense. So, my dad had my brother run and grab all the fire extinguishers he had. After they used all of them my dad had my brother run to our next-door neighbor/cousin's house and borrow all their extinguishers. Those combined with the dying of wind caused the flames to finally get under control. I have pictures where the entire fire is covered in extinguisher exhaust because my dad is on one side and my brother is on the other side. I choose this picture because I liked the half flame half exhaust thing.   Another reason I haven't posted as much is because I've been writing a more detailed journal of my life almost every day. Because of that I haven't had as much desire to write anything for my web site. That, plus, I haven't had time to take more pictures - and with my goal to always post a picture... well, you get the idea.   The sad thing about writing in a journal is that I'm starting to see that my life isn't all that exciting. At least, that's what it seemed like at first. Now I'm starting to see how unique and interesting most moments are in my life. It seems like it's mostly perspective. I think I'm kind of oblivious to life just trying to enjoy everything and because of that I miss the fact that cool stuff happens. Sounds paradoxical, huh? Yeah, I'm confused too. My point is... Well, I lost it. But, I enjoy running. I think it's time to run.

       urlLink    Here's my random website of the month. Some dude made these flash movies that look like the old Nintendo Mario video game. It's like Lord of the Rings meets Mario Brothers. Really funny stuff - on account of its "intensity." If you don't want to waste any time then just watch Part II - it's my favorite. The music is my favorite part of the movies. I'm trying to find the album so I can buy it on iTunes, but so far I'm discovering that iTunes doesn't carry what I'm looking for.

       urlLink    My brother and his wife bought an Aibo dog from Sony. They got it today and they're trying to figure 'em out. This is a five minute video clip of the little guy. They named him Snoopy. We're discovering that it's more like a dog than a robot, because it won't always listen to you. The first 30 seconds are the best the rest kind of gets boring. But, if you're researching the Aibo dog you might enjoy the entire video.

       urlLink    I went out walking this morning to wake up so that I could study and I saw this rabbit in the yard. It just stood there as I looked at it - and I was probably only about ten feet away. So, I ran back into my office to grab my camera. When I came back outside it was gone but after looking around I ended up finding it behind the office. So, I started taking pictures - each time getting closer. I took about 20 pictures and ended up being only about two feet away. My guess is that this is the mother of the little baby rabbits we found last month. I'm assuming that since her babies were taken to a nearby park reserve she feels like she has nothing to live for. It was like she was so depressed. Maybe she thought I could take her to her babies. Sorry, momma, I don't know where they are.

I love that you can see the word "Home" printed on the blanket. I also like that you can see the father wearing his wedding ring. There's nothing happier than being raised in a good home with both parents.

I've liked the colors that my camera reproduces so well that I haven't wanted to desaturate any of my pictures. This one was taken indoors but with light coming in from the outside. The colors bouncing around the room made the colors look a little weak, so this one looks better B&W.

       urlLink    I went camping in my parent's yard with my niece and nephew last night. This is a picture of them. I didn't have my camera with me last night, so this is a picture of them when our family went out to Nauvoo.  We started out by watching a couple episodes of "The Muppets" on DVD. Then we brushed our teeth and climbed into the tent. It was pretty hot and humid out - but I figured it wouldn't matter that much. Nat and Bito (nicknames) wanted me to read them a book so we did that until (after about four pages) Bito said he was going to sleep. So, then we hopped into our beds and said our prayers.  Things were going well (expect that my blankets felt damp from the humidity) until Bito started playing with his flashlight. I finally coaxed him into turning it off; but, then he kept talking. (I could have sworn that he wanted to go to bed!) After threats of taking him into "grandma and grandpa's" the house he quieted down for a while.  After a couple minutes Bito started wrestling around. He couldn't sleep well - he said his four inch foam mattress was "bumpy." I asked if he wanted to go inside - "yes" he replied. I took him in and put him to bed then came back out to the tent - Nat was asleep. After a few minutes of dealing with uncomfortable sheets I dozed off. My "sleep" lasted about an hour - I woke up, feeling damp and uncomfortable.  Finally, I decided that it sucked outside and that my bed at home was calling me. I tried to wake up Nat, but she was sound asleep. I picked her up and carried her into the house. After that I went to my house, showered, and jumped into a real bed. Ah!!!!   In the morning my parents said that Nat was crying a bit because she didn't know where she was.  I think I enjoy camping but on nights like last night I it sucks.

It's a totally funny website that I think you'll enjoy. There are a couple items (e.g. stories, links, movies) that might be, perhaps, offensive to like one or two people, but most of it is hilarious (at least, if your sense of humor is strange enough for this kind of wit).  I'll pre-warn you, though. After following   this link and reading up on ninjas you will dream for  real ultimate power !!!
