           I go to a youth group called Exit Earth. IT is an awesome group of people who are very out going and fun to hang out wit. We have a very talented music group which consist of my "brother" Cody on the guitar, my cuz Tasha on the mic, Sam on the Bass, and Jeff on the drums. We meet every thursday and have an awesome worship time and then a powerful sermand by our youth Paster Dave who also sings in the worship group. Some times we get together and have game nights, and sometimes we have get togethers outside of youth and do stuff.
