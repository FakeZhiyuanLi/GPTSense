      Go to the bar.  Allow the culture to wash over you, gain perspective by osmosis.  To place yourself in a conduit of human interaction is to learn without making mistakes.  There is power in contradictions, silence among noise, detachment amongst  emotion; if the unsocial dissapear then where does that leave me?  There is life in the middle of the oldest glacier, there is life on the vents of the deepest ocean trenches, can there not be life on a lone barstool? I’ve forgotten.  Perhaps I’ve made a mistake, maybe I cannot learn without interaction.  A life of missed opportunities results in a continuous existence of apology.  I’m sorry that I’ve lost my ability to react…  but a smile is all it takes to mend a broken heart.   Sometimes a glance is enough to change a mood.  The un-reactive are stuck in a cycle of apologies and gratifications.  Thank you, I'm sorry, thank you, I'm sorry than...     "Is anyone sitting here?"  I know it without looking, she is beautiful, she is sexy, another woman of my dreams.  I shake my head without making eye contact.  It's no use trying to talk over the music anyway, what good is having a conversation when you...     "So are you from Seward?"  She has to shout just so I hear her, she has pushed the barstool to the side and is leaning, her back to the bar.  She talks without looking at me, head bobbing slightly as Hobo Jim belts out another Bob Dylan tune, eyes sliding over the faces of the crowd.  (to be continued)

      Sup Everyone,  I just thought I'd remark a tid on Erik's adventure/accomplishment piece, (if I may label it such)...  The Chris Man liketh.  It reminded me of all of the activities that I endured and how it is after the accomplishment of the act that I truly realize it's importance.  Erik, you got a way with words dude.  Right away, I wasn't sure where it was going but I just let it take me to the epiphany waiting at the end.  Good stuff dude, keep posting....  As for me I am just trying to keep my head above water with the wedding being 4 weeks away!!!!!!!  As soon as I get something new on digital paper I'll post it..no rush though...I am currently making Flash Resumes for a job out in Portland, OR at George Fox university and another Flash Resume for Burton Snowboards, plus working at Fishhook and taking Cash jobs at AAction Movers....plus making a Flash slideshow for the wedding reception...methinks I'm keeping busy :-)  Alright, I'm on the board.....ttyl  The Chris Man

      well, I suppose I'll kick things off here with a little diddy i wrote lately.  	 We left early, before six in the morning because we were going to attempt a climb that most others take two days for in only one.  We parked the car on one of the many scenic pullouts along the Going to the Sun highway and set out.  The first part of the climb was a grueling vertical march up the side of a ridge called the Glacier Wall that separates the east and west portions of the park.  We followed a dry stream bed that offered a small measure of protection from the snarled vegetation that would make any other passage impossible.  It is difficult for those who have never experienced a climb to understand the physical stress it entails.  After one hundred steps the legs begin to burn, after another fifty they are dead tired, the last couple thousand are taken on will power alone.  Before reaching the top of the ridge we had to scout out and find a way up a vertical wall of rock twenty feet high.  Finally on the top of the ridge we were able to begin our actual ascent of Heavens Peak.   	We followed a wide elk trail along the top of the ridge enjoying the flat route, catching our breath while we looked down on hidden valleys and unnamed waterfalls.  Our respite was brief however, as we were soon faced with the difficulty of climbing down a wet rock face to the floor of a hanging valley.  When climbing, the connection of your feet with the ground is often a matter of life and death, and to be forced to climb on wet rock where that connection is tenuous is terrifying.  We made it however, the only casualty being a camera in a backpack that dropped thirty feet.  With out boots on dry land again, we quickly crossed the floor of the hanging valley, weaving in and out of the gigantic boulders, eerie evidence of past rock slides.   		The rest of the ascent was similar to most others, a hard march up to the summit ridge and then an enjoyable hike to the summit itself.  The one exception being when I chose to climb up a snow field while my partners decided it was too steep and took the long way down and around to avoid it.  I soon regretted not following them, as I was furiously kicking my feet and pounding my hands into the hard packed snow, using the hand holds as foot holds all the way up.  At one point, one of my feet broke through and I was left dangling on the side of the snow face waiting to see if the other would support my weight.  When I got to the top of the snow field I saw my partners far ahead of me on the summit ridge, I could only shake my head and sit on a rock completely drained.   We summated around one o’clock and took our customary lunch there and each went off to ourselves to rest and reflect.  It is hard to describe what goes through my head as I sit at the summit of a mountain munching on crackers and cheese.  One would think the mind would take the sweeping panoramas as an opportunity to soar, but rather I find myself oddly silent; as if the climb itself is the education and the rigors of the body take their strength from the mind. 	We collected our things, found the piece of PVC piping that housed the tattered register, signed our names, and began our descent.  All went well until we arrived at the face of wet rock.  The short ascent took longer than we anticipated and by the time we found ourselves once again on top of the Glacier Wall the sun was perilously close to the top of the western peaks.  Now there was only the cliff that separated us from the dry streambed and our way home.  We found the place where we ascended but the handholds were useless for our descent.  We spread out to find another way down the cliff, walking on a steep grassy plane that stained the bottom of our boots a dark green.  It was at this point, physically and mentally exhausted from the days events, that I slipped.  I fell fast and hard and reached for anything to catch me and keep me from going over the cliff.  What I found was a stalk of Bear Grass, it should not have been able to hold me.  I pulled myself to my knees and eventually made my way to the top of the ridge.   We did not find a way down that night.  We slept under the stars next to a small fire that we started with pages from our climbers guide.  We woke the next morning reeking of smoke, and made our way down the mountain just in time to keep the rangers from sending out a search and rescue team. If at the summit of a mountain, the mind is still, the climb itself offers much to think about when it is over and done with.  After climbing, the small difficulties of the day seem trivial.  After the adrenaline fades, its presence can be felt as a constant reminder of the hidden resources a body holds.  After a stalk of grass saves you from a fall, you are willing to look for any solution to any problem with full confidence that one does exist.  After you look back at the peak you just climbed, you know nothing is impossible.

      Chris: Congratulations, the wedding not the ankle.  And, I hope your ankle recovers speedily.  I'm so impressed with the bachelor party.  Sounds like a blast.  Maybe I should throw one of those here sometime soon.    Kris: I so want to see Fahrenheit 9/11.  But where I'm living it has not reached the theaters.  I'm sure I'll like it though.  I'm incredibly liberal, and I love Michael Moore.    Erik: I've been reading Les Miserables.  It is fanfuckingtastic.  I cannot believe how much I'm getting into it.  I've been pretty busy, so I'm only a few hundred pages in.  But, it is good.  You were right again.  Your record holds as being right on everything except for politics and feminism!  miss you guys, Sarah

      First and foremost, congratulations to Christopher Aaron Lindgren on his marriage yesterday.  I wish you the best, my friend.  Second, I don't know if I'm preaching to the choir or if I will inflame some hate responses from any of you, but view Fahrenheit 9/11.  If you don't want to because of the anti-Bush propaganda, then at least go to the movie and find some way to dispute it.  Good stuff.  Highly recommended.  And again, congrats Chris.  What a stud.

      Hey everyone,  Erik, I'm sorry about the loss.  I pray your family can find peace.    Now it seems almost vulgar to speak of, but I just wanted you peeps to know that I am typing to you from my bed, with a pulsating right ankle, neslted within a splint.  I, Chris Lindgren, was having a most excellent Bachelor's Party on Sunday.  My Groomsmen and I brought guns and ammo and shot and shot guns, smoked cigars, went canoeing and drank some beers and I smoked a couple more cigars in the canoe.  It was pretty sweet.  I gave my groomsmen their Samurai Swords, with the carved characters that read youyi on the scabbard, which means "profound friendship" or "fellowship".  It was great.  Then we all did some late night trampoline jumping as the hot dogs cooked on the late night grill.  When the dogs were done, everyone but Trev and I went inside.  We remained on the tramp.  We were doing flips and such, each outdoing the other.  Until, I tried something pretty stupid.  I tried a front flip, immediately followed by a black flip.  The good news is that I landed on my two feet, the bad news is that my right ankle buckled and made the most gruesome crackle-pop noise.  The noise and buckle you can only see on ESPN highlights.  Grant and Jake drove me back to Fargo, to Innovis and the ER Doctor told me I needed to have surgery and had to come back tomorrow and talk to a Dr. Piatt.  So anyways, I had surgery on my right ankle because it is an "Unstable Fracture."  I now have hardware, to be specific, I have a plate and 6 screws within my body.  Well, I will have to indulge everyone with the details later.  I have to work on the Wedding presentation.  The wedding is on Friday!    All I know is that it feels wierd to have metal underneath my skin.  Later,  The Chris Man

      This is a poem that I started working on a month ago.  Coincidentally, it sat dormant for about a month and I have three "drafts" of it now.  This one is the third draft, which I decided to put to some kind of rhyme scheme, just for the sake of forcing myself into some kind of pattern.  Should probably get into the habit of that.  If anyone has any interest, I will post the other "versions" though they are a lot rougher.  Suggestions/ideas/etc are welcome.  It's called "acyclical" which is a word that I have coined for "something that doesn't exist in cycle (or) infinite."  Excuse any heretical meanderings in my thoughts, I'm attempting to say that God didn't do what he said according to the Bible, but just came here because he wanted to be cyclical (finite).  Wow--I thought that was a great title then, but now looking at it, it doesn't seem so fitting.  Seems kind of random in fact.  And now we view Kris's verbose two paragraphs of drivel.  Sorry for that, folks.  Here it is:  Though easy to reason his purpose was greater— The powerful thundering omnipotent  Pater , Who from the motionless throes out of time Decided, desired, and so created a nadir.  Standing on the infinite border sublime He cast forth his son to deliver with wine A blessing a burden a gift with sinsear Of purpose and passion, but queer yet benign    That people astounded perked up with their fear To proclaim his purpose with infinite cheer He’s come to save us all from our deaths Because God has forgiven we sinners— o notre pere !  Though easy to reason his purpose was greater— The Pater the nadir the gift  le fils Christ  Descended with no greater desire nor drive Than to live as a man, as man then to die.

      Prince is the shit.  I just went to his concert on Friday.  It was amazing.  He blew my mind.  Hit after hit, and what a musician.  His band was perfection, and he played the guitar phenomenally.  What a guy.  He even had afterparties at his house.  Directions were on the monitors after the encore.  It was fifty bucks to get in, and I heard it was really cool and intimate and he just sat and played songs and took requests.  We thought it would be packed so we didn't go.  But wow.  It was phenomenal.  Peace out

      Erik, I'm always amazed at your ability to really take in places for what they're worth.  You learn something everywhere you go.  And, you always take advantage of your surroundings.  I'm so glad to hear that you are finding Alaska so beneficial.    Alas, after spending many moons in Hibbing I feel that I too know why the caged bird sings.  If it weren't for my dvd collection, substance abuse would certainly be around the corner.  I don't drink while in Hibbing which is good, this is no place for depressants.  I'm also biking all the time.  I think a lot about nature and people that like nature.  I feel I was given allergies as a sign that I should be distanced from the elements.  I don't know.  But, I feel healthy so whatever.    My kids are really something else though.  Oh my gosh they're so funny (I've been working at a daycare for schoolage kids).  They're all amazed at the fact that I don't have any children.  And, it's funny but I think I learn a lot about men and women there.  The way they interact with each other is really similar to the way adults interact with each other.  It's a learning experience.  Plus, my friend Jen's baby is so gorgeous.  Oh my gosh.  He's so content.  Some babies are always crying and fussy and don't want to be held by other people.  But, just the other day I sat and held him for like an hour and a half and he didn't cry or fuss around once.  He just stared at me then some other people then the room, he's brilliant I can tell already.  Hibbing is PG this year.  All the men in my life have runny noses and are learning their alphabets.  Kris I'm so jealous of your drawing class.  What kind of drawing is it?  I took a charcoal drawing class that I adored.  All we drew was people.  I sucked, but it was so fun.  My teacher was no Bob Ross, but I managed.   Well I'm gonna peace out now and help my friend move into his new apartment.     Sarah

      I've been in Alaska for seventeen days time for a first analysis, the kind that often is chuckled over months and years down the line for it's naivety and ignorance.   The first impression of this place is the size. Glacier showed me a rugged landscape of snowcapped peaks and massive valleys. I never thought I would find a place to rival the wildness of that place but was proven wrong before I ever set foot in Alaska. Looking out of the window of the airplane as it flew over north western canada and alaska was humbling, here was size for sizes sake. Miles and miles of peaks as far as my elevated eye could see stretched out in an inhospitable grace. Here was no park, no scenic highways, no visitor centers or manicured campgrounds but simply mountains and valleys that could care less if they ever felt a hikers step. Glacier and Alaska, similar specimens, one caged and one wild.   Once I settled down in Seward my surroundings shrunk to a manageable size and I could begin looking deeper. I have started to watch and listen as the local alaskans go about their daily business. Living with the mayor has allowed me to taste some of the political cuisine and I learn more every night as we talk over a glass of wine. One thing i had to get a grasp of is the simple fact that alaska as a state is not yet fifty years old. There are many old timers who lived in the alaska territory. Already I am learning how much I cannot understand. Tales of clashes on the sea as fishermen vie for the best fishing areas, it was not long ago that setting ones nets up in front of another boats nets was an offense that may warrant a quick splash of automatic gunfire across the offending boats bow. Another interesting note is that alaska has roughly 600 thousand people comprable to north dakota yet is three times the size of texas. Also, the alaskan public fund set up by the state government as a surplus for the people using oil revenues and the profits from other resources harvested in the state runs in the billions of dollars, enough to pay it's residents upwards of 2000 dollars a year on the interest and simultaneously provide a financial backing to the states budget. Can you imagine having a billion dollar surplus?   more more and more i will stop now and continue my observations at a later date. talk to you all later hope you're having a good summer.

      Hello gentles and lady.  Sorry I'm late getting on this.  I've been busy with this stupid summer class of mine that eats up all time imaginable.  (Chris--it's like Taggart times two and way too early in the morning for me to pull any effective 5:00am catch-up action.)  Speaking of which, I ran into her at Cashwise the other day and she was talking to me about graduate schools for rhetoric and composition studies.  I think I'd rather (to vaguely quote Ginsberg):  take ship to Africa.  I don't know how the conversation progressed to that.  Perhaps we were talking about the weather, or life, or what colors of underwear we were then wearing.  Yes, that must be it.  Also, here's news.  I'm in a class with Kyle Garey this summer (it's an art class) and he delights in drawing pictures of penises on all of his works.  It's a good thing.  We've done nude models for the past few days, so naturally any inspiration that I might come by has been sapped by (to again quote Ginsberg, though this time more accurately) "America's naked mind for love."  I will read your piece and comment on it shortly, Erik.  On June 11th, the summer will be mine for writing.  Glad to see we're all here.

      Hey, great to hear from you guys.  Chris it sounds like you are pretty busy with all sorts of things, let us know how things progress!  Sarah, I am assuming Hibbing is being good to you, it must be nice to spend some time at home before heading out into the vast Iowa wilderness.  Things are good here, I climbed my first mountain today...ouch... it was tough but i'm glad I made it...it's sometimes hard climbing by yourself because you know you could always turn around at any time and nobody would know, I took a ton of pictures because I'd get to one point and say to myself ok, i'm for sure turning around here and take a bunch of pictures, then I'd stand up and find myself going further up...let me know if you guys have any suggestions/improvements for our little blog here.  Did you guys see the new york times article about blogging?  Good God!  they made it sound like the next form of heroin! it is  urlLink here  but you have to sign up for an account to see it,  it's free and i've been signed up for about a year with no spam or any problems, you get an online issue every day and its kinda nice.  anyways, the author says blogging is addicting and focuses on people who spend the wedding anniversery blogging etc...  retarded.  well i'll talk to you all later  hope all are doing well.  erik

      Wow Erik  You are just full of insightful writing.  Alaska must be treating you well.  And Chris, congrats on the wedding.  I didn't get anything written like I had planned this weekend.  I did watch the basketball games though.  Our poor guys.  This may be a dumb insight but I feel they may have won but at least we have a nice/smart looking team.  I mean some of those Lakers look like they have the mental capacity of a first grader.  And, others are on trial.  So, to me, it was a moral victory for the Timberwolves.  I'm going to get writing tonight.  Peace out  Sarah

      kris,  thanks for catchin up, your thoughts are very well formulated,  as for *First, "the title [Agenbite of Inwit] (originally spelled "Ayenbite of Inwyt") means 'the remorse of conscience', literally, 'the again-biting of inner wit'."*  I must humbly admit i do not understand the source or meaning of this sentence, nor how it applies to my statement.  If you could be so kind and explain these things, I would appreciate it.  gratz  erik

      First, "the title [Agenbite of Inwit] (originally spelled "Ayenbite of Inwyt") means 'the remorse of conscience', literally, 'the again-biting of inner wit'."  Second, I need to catch up.  Maybe I'm just making this up, but I'm pretty sure I remember Russia having something like 30,000-some nukes at the heart of their days in "power" - I wonder what happened to those nukes that so drastically reduced their arsenal?  Did they destroy them?  Regardless, there still is a mass quantity of DU somewhere in Russia, to be sure.  Perhaps what happened to it is the same thing that happened to a nuclear storehouse (that the UN knew about, mind you) that was left all but defenseless during the official days of the war in Iraq.  (March 2003.)  I think the U.S. had something like 20,000 nukes, too.  Where those are, I'm not sure?  I should look up a link to at least corroborate this, but I'm more willing to just trust my memory, no matter how flaky it is.  Third, there are a lot of positively terrible books that make best sellers.  Just look at anything by Stephen King.  (Just kidding Erik, no need to put me on a hit list.)  Or anything that contains the initials KJV or NIV.  (Just kidding Chris, nor do you.)  Or anything by...Susan Powter, 80's fitness guru?  (Sorry, Sarah, couldn't think of anything that might engage some higher-level thinking on your part, something that I could attribute to just you.)  Honestly, what disturbs me more is America's preponderance with all things mental health (e.g. Dr. Phil--is that even his name?) and dietary.  Fourth (and forth!), fly fishing sounds like an excellent pastime.  Enjoy it while you can, Erik.  I bet you must eat salmon about every other meal up there.  And I bet it's delicious.  Fifth, I can scarcely go two days without checking my e-mail, Chris.  Any time away from it for that long is honestly like "roughing it" - I would rather not have any warm clothes in the winter than go without my (or someone else's) computer.  Sixth, times for politics (or pollutics, of which I am rather fond)--I'm dividing up this bullet (...right...) into sections because it's easier for me that way.  Sarah said:      I do believe that it is used to increase our fear for purposes of support for our government leaders and anti-foreign country sentiment (not totally sure what that means but it sounded good and I went with it).         This sounds like something Michael Moore would say to me.  I do agree with it, though.  Nothing like a war would get accomplished without someone being scared.  I read something today about how democrats like to justify wars in terms of stopping genocide, wheres Republicans are more about stopping the proliferation of WMDs (in the article it says those used against Israel).  Coincidentally, the article also predicts which country will be the next to be attacked--Iran (republicans) or Sudan (democrats).  Here's the link, if anyone cares:   urlLink http://www.antiwar.com/orig/prather.php?articleid=3214   Disclaimer for the sake of argument, prolonging anti foreign government sentiment might apply to all nations on the earth save one:  Israel.  Must not have anti-foreign feelings about that one.  "Anti-American" is something that I am called from time to time.  I've even been told that I should "just leave."  If everyone who was anti-war left, this country would fall apart.  Where would the troops to fight the never-ending wars come from?  ;-)  "News to the beautiful people--there are more of us than there are of you."  (Sorry--egregious misplacement of allusion to the Revenge of the Nerds.  I apologize.)  Erik said:          i find it difficult to say that the american abroad and at home is as safe now as 5, 10, or 20 years.         I agree with this.  However, you must take into consideration things that others feel to the United States, if you even try to make this argument any more sound.  (I realize that you left it basically blank, and probably wanted to keep it that way.  I'm just trying to raise another point here, though.)  Noam Chomsky (revolutionary linguist, "anti-American") would probably argue something about how the U.S. has treated other nations abroad, ...exploitation due to the outsourcing of jobs, ousting governments (Sandanistas in Nicaragua for instance), installing dictators (Shah in Iran), supporting Hussein during the Iraq/Iran war.  It's all in the name of whatever is in the best interest of the nation.  I'm not saying there is any justification in beheading people, flying planes into buildings, bombing trains, but I'm also not saying that there's justification in 10 years of sanctions that kills 500,000 (due to lack of food/medicine) in Iraq.  Take it all as you will.       I feel personally that if science could unlock the secret inner workings of a single human being, then all would be revealed.      Easy, Erik, refer to the first thing that I posted in this entry.  Seventh, my address is:  3511  19th St South  Eighth, and I still am (interminably) in Fargo, ND 58104.

      hey yall,  sarah, how refreshing it is to talk pollutics with you again. I must disagree with you though about the rise of terrorism in the world today.  true, there has always been and always will be terrorism in the world, as long as there are smaller factions forced to fight against a stronger more sophisticated entity this will never change.  But with car bombs killing 60 people at a time, train bombings killing hundreds and beheadings on the nightly news i find it difficult to say that the american abroad and at home is as safe now as 5, 10, or 20 years ago.  What is scary about the terror attacks in the past 2 years is that they are frequently being justified, defended or minimized by a growing number of governments and people.  However, looking only at the effect will never lead to an understanding of the cause.  This problem is not a new one, and to find it's cause one would have to look past the Bushes, past the Regeans, and past the Trumans.  I feel personally that if science could unlock the secret inner workings of a single human being, then all would be revealed.  to chew on... erik  ps.  chris and everyone else, my address is 509 arnold ave portland nd 58274  and the phone nbr is 701 788 3426 (my parents addy and number).  will write more later  thanks for contributing everybody love to hear from you all

      Well, I'm glad J. Simp. doesn't have an autobiography.  Those minutes reading the blogs were tense.  But, about the terrorism and nuclear weapons, I don't really believe that there is this huge rise in terrorism.  I do believe that it is used to increase our fear for purposes of support for our government leaders and anti-foreign country sentiment (not totally sure what that means but it sounded good and I went with it).  I think we are more aware of it in our nation, but I don't think it has risen substantially.  Yes, the attack on September eleventh was huge.  But, I do believe it was in large part our government and its leaders that just didn't deliver the job they were supposed to.  Just think of how many terrorist attempts we are unaware of that have been prevented.  And, thinking about terrorism, people have become so loose with their meaning of the word.  By denotation it indicates one who inflicts terror on another.  That does not discriminate between any kind of murder, rape, or abuse.  Now however this huge connotation has grow indicating an attack on innocent civilians from anti-Americans.  And, you know I really hate the way people throw that term around too.  Whenever anything is said against the president people scream anti-American.  To me it's anti-Bush which is a far cry from being anti-American (indicating they hate the very foundation of our country and its morals, values, beliefs, etc.).  I don't know.  I'm sure you were watching the DNC Erik.  Probably taped it and are glued to the screen now huh.  I'll send my Iowa address soon.  It's written down somewhere, and I can't find it right now.  5 days til the big move!  Peace out, Sarah

      What I initially heard on the news was that **Blank** Simpson's autobiography sold over 400,000 copies in it's first week of sales.  I looked into it.  Jessica Simpson has a evil sister who plays that pop-punk, rock-and/or-roll and that sister's name is Ashlee Simpson.  Her album is titled, "Autobiography."    I guess the most coveted song-writers and producer (who shall be left unknown in the article, but I looked up.  His name is  John Shanks (Sheryl Crow, Melissa Etheridge, Alanis Morrissette))  worked on her album.......sheesh!  The producer claims she co-wrote the whole album, aka the songwriters watched her life on MTV reality shows.  So much time, effort and money into a Simpson chick....all I ask is WHY AMERICA, WHY!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!    On a lighter note:    Erik, you be fly-fishing!  I envy you a bit; that is an awesome past-time.  Have fun, be young, and drink (insert beverage).  Everyone should put their addresses on the blog so I can randomly send you guys and gal letters and such.  Laura and I are moving the 17th of August to Portland, OR.  We rented the Uhaul trailer yesterday (6'x12'x5'5'').  I'll put my address as soon as I can on the blog.      I'm not sure when we will have access to the internet, which sucks BIG, cause I'm an addict when it comes to email checking.      I wrote a poem a couple days ago, which Kris has already tapped into and given me some feedback...It wasn't finished when he read it, so hopefully it has improved since the last...I'll post it in a few days, I only have a few more hours to put in at work so the weekend shall be open to write a bit :-)    Keep the blog alive.    Later,    The Chris Man    (p.s. this post ended up going longer than originally planned:-)

      first off, didn't even know J. Sis had an autobio comin out, is she even 30 yet?&nbsp;   cool info on the nukes guys.&nbsp; It is a scary to think about all the nukes out there, but I find that with the rise of terrorism, I am more concerned with a bomb in a car, or under a coat.&nbsp; What must it be like to live with the constant threat of random murder?&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the threat of nuclear weapons is like the lion at the edge of the village, a recognized danger whose apparent innaction has breeded flippancy?&nbsp;   hard to think...been learning how to fly fish...am becoming obsessed. erik

      Hello All,   Kris and I met and spoke about various world issues and one of the topics was nuclear proliferation and such.....well, I was not aware that certain countries had achieved such power: China, Israeal, India, and especially North Korea.....I have known that they all want nukes, but I had no idea until Kris informed me......  Then I stumbled upon this article on  urlLink MSN  (of all places).....Below is the gist of it:  "According to information compiled by the  urlLink Nuclear Threat Initiative , an organization devoted to monitoring the status of the nuclear threat worldwide, nine countries had nukes by April 2004. The nine countries are listed below. Each figure includes the approximate number of both tactical and strategic bombs (nuclear and thermonuclear, or "big" and "really humongous").  Country&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warheads  United States&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10,455 Russia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8,400 China&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 400 France&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;350 Israel*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 250 United Kingdom&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 200 India**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 65 Pakistan**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 40 North Korea***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8 TOTAL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20,168  Asterisks explained  * Israel has a policy called "nuclear opacity" or "nuclear ambiguity," which consists of refusing to confirm or deny that it has nuclear weapons at all. In 1986, however, whistle-blower Mordechai Vanunu, an Israeli nuclear weapons worker, published pictures of nuclear weapons facilities in Israel. Today, experts agree that Israel has between 100 and 300 warheads (and Israel doesn't deny it).  ** India and Pakistan both admit (boast?) that they have weapons, but are cagey about how many. Estimates for India run from 40 to 90 and for Pakistan from 30 to 50.  *** North Korea is anybody's guess. At the end of 2003, U.S. intelligence experts were surmising it had three bombs, but four months later they tentatively raised their estimate to eight. They also said North Korea is geared up to build about six bombs a year from here on out.  In short, there are now some 20,000 fully operational nukes pointed at someone in this world."

      hey guys, woo new font!&nbsp;&nbsp; pretty!  Kris thnx for the comments, they all get emailed to me automatically so it's like i'm getting emails...exciting for one in the frozen north!   i want to clear up the preposition statement that has created some stir amongst the natives...&nbsp; the context was  "tackle some of the writing points we feel uncomfortable in (like choosing the correct prepositions :)"&nbsp;&nbsp;  'in' being the nasty preposition that caused so much confusion.&nbsp; I agree with kris as he&nbsp;touts the fluidity of language used by&nbsp;Joyce and Kerouac and&nbsp;believe that breaking rules&nbsp;is how new rules get made, but it is important&nbsp;to be going somewhere when you leave the beaten path, I too often find myself breaking the rules of 'fine lit-er-a-ture' out of lazyness or ignorance in which case a&nbsp;quick slap on the wrist is what i deserve.&nbsp;   kris, about my plans, i'll be home for a bit at the beginning of october till nov or so.&nbsp; its either colorado or maui next...already been to steamboat, but got a friend moving there and would be cool to live with him.&nbsp; but alot of people who work up here go to work in maui on the&nbsp;whale watchin boats down there and&nbsp;i will know a bunch of people living there who could help me get a job.&nbsp; so we'll find out.  talk later all  erik&nbsp;

      Comments are in the same order as the story.&nbsp; If I had Office XP, I would just send you a commented copy of your paper, but as I don't have any MS Office on my computer right now, that's an impossibility.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Parts bolded are great or things to pay attention to.  Here goes:   I like " dirty dishes clutter kitchen tops, tables, stained sofa cushions " - I feel the sentence falls apart as you make it more complicated than the blast of adjectivals, though.&nbsp; "...which complement blahblahblah" - I guess I feel that is colorless, odorless, whereas the first part of the sentence just...works.   "Crumbs decorate..." - what crumbs?&nbsp; "Crumbs" could be anything.&nbsp; When you re-write this, I want it blasted with more details, no matter how stupid they may sound.  "topped with smothered cigarettes" sounds good.   Weird she has a breast pocket.&nbsp; And even weird she stores her smokes there.  "leans back into the futon" - Kind of drab description.&nbsp; Bland, I guess.&nbsp; Not flashy enough.&nbsp;  Sounds like tired description.&nbsp; I guess it is a tired thing to do, though.  What does "abreactive" mean?&nbsp; M-W.com doesn't list it.&nbsp; (Please post the definition in the comments part on this for me.)   "with the pain of not really feeling" -  I want more here .&nbsp; (This comes after the first phone call in that paragraph.)   "Once again, her thumbs shoot up the dial pad, absolving any sense of numbness." - Thumbs?&nbsp; When was the last time you used the phone with two thumbs?&nbsp; "Absolve = set free from an obligation or the consequences of guilt" - is this the right word?   In phone conversation number three, I want to hear something like "Do you remember me?" - I think that would be funny.&nbsp; I think my  5am eyes  saw that while buzzing through it.&nbsp; Heh.   “Twila, you’re done!” -  Would she really say this?&nbsp; Might think it .&nbsp; Not say it.&nbsp; Unless you have her talking to herself prior to this, it might work now, but she seems like it's just all (or not at all) going on inside her head.&nbsp; (See paragraphs between phone calls for what I'm getting at here.)   2nd to last paragraph:&nbsp; I don't really like the word "scurries."&nbsp; She seems to have more resolve than that to me.&nbsp; She's not so fickle in her actions to me.&nbsp; More purposeful.&nbsp; But then again, she does make three phone calls, using her thumbs, and just has the aura of disgust.&nbsp; I guess it works.&nbsp; Just a personal thing probably.   "butt from the ashes" - I know you don't know much about smoking, but this revolts me.&nbsp; It really does.&nbsp; I'm thinking that it does the same for Erik.&nbsp; A butt from the...ashes.&nbsp;  Worst possible thing.     What else is she doing on the computer? &nbsp; What is she waiting for?&nbsp; More songs?&nbsp; Someone to talk to online?&nbsp; Her boyfriend to come?&nbsp; Thinking of love?&nbsp;&nbsp; I kind of want to hear what this girl is thinking about more.&nbsp; You don't really give too much.&nbsp; There's the phone calls and the parts leading up to that.&nbsp; Perhaps you're going for that.&nbsp;   Funny...there are probably things that I said on the first draft of this that are contradictory to what I'm saying now.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Just have fun with it.&nbsp; And if you're discouraged about my comments just wait until I have a short story up for you to belittle.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; (That is not to mean that I'm belittling yours; it's just constructive, that's all.)

      Sup everyone,   Let's see......to start with, i reread Erik's post about my revision and I finally realized what his comment on prepositions was referring to....I freakin' missed and messed up that oh so important end of the first paragraph.....I intially wrote, "on the keyboard of the&nbsp;computer," and it occured to me the non-stupido way of saying that would be, "particularly the computer keyboard."   Man I can sure pull off some good grammar blunders on occassion!&nbsp; And Erik, if you were referring to something on a much larger/small scale, just let me know ;-)  Also, another "QUICK adjustment" is the rapid-fire movement of life. Laura and I will be moving to Portland, OR this mid-to-end of august. She was accepted into the graduate program at George Fox University, so now we are scrambling to plan our move!!!!!   I just finished my last class at NDSU,  Arguementation &amp; Debate , this last Friday (7-16-04). If there is one thing I learned is that I am freakin awesome at Cross Examination! I butchered my  opponents....'twas grand! I think I was inspired by my years of watching  Law &amp;Order .   My plan of action out in Portland is to find a JOB, JOB and then volunteer my writing/editing services at a local organization to not only gain experience, but get involved in the first place.   Love to hear what's going on in your dudette and dudes' lives. Drop the blog bomb!   Missing my English fellows, both mind and soul,   The Chris Man

      Hey Chris: The picture is gorgeous.  My mother said you look just like models in an ad.   I'm watching the O'Reilly factor right now.  He's discussing the difference between dissent and dishonor.    Well, I will be in Fargo the weekend of the 24th.  Should be crazy.  I'm getting ready to move, and everything seems to be going fine.  On my way to Iowa.    I hope all is well with everyone.  Peace out Sarah

      hey everyone, thanks for keepin the blog up and runnin while i've been so silent.  It is hard to write here on the computer since the laptop must remain plugged into the phone jack which is in the living room right next to the television, with 7 people living in the house it is a rare time when there is not someone talking or the tv is on.  things go good here, things fall apart and are tenuously replaced yaddah yaddah yaddah, saw my first sea monster yaddah yaddah yaddah, got real drunk yaddah yaddah yaddah.  I will write more later,   Chris read over your story just now, it is poignant for me as I find myself in the same situation as the woman in your story, clingy and smoking too much.  I do find a underlying sense of tension in your story, of borderline panic, and i like that.  If i remember correctly the first version of the story i think you've made some good revisional decsions, seems pretty tight, less is more, less is more, less is more.  and you know i love the closure!!  I think maybe it would be beneficial for us to challenge ourselves and tackle some of the writing points we feel uncomfortable in (like choosing the correct prepositions :) maybe you could write a snippet of what happens when the boyfriend does come over there is so much going on whenever love (or it's  pinata )is present.  talk to all            a           t           erik           r  once again thanks for writing everyone, i love to hear you all,

      Hey friends,  I just finished another drafting of that short story I wrote just b4 school finished.  I'd appreciate some feedback to certain elements I added to the story.  If you have questions just let me know..... Thanks :-)   Here it goes, just like this:  Colorless, Odorless By Chris Lindgren  The View blares from the kitchen TV competing with Amy Grant’s distorted voice from the bedroom.  Dirty dishes clutter kitchen tops, tables, stained sofa cushions, which complement the litter of soiled clothes throughout the apartment.  Crumbs decorate the furniture, particularly the keyboard of the computer that rests on the desk beside the futon. She sits at the edge of the futon staring at the computer screen. A wave of smoke rises from the plastic bowl cupped in her right hand as her left hand stuffs another Marlboro Red into the wasteland of ash, topped with smothered cigarettes.  Her eyes anticipate Twila Paris’ song, Destiny to finish downloading.   	Her hand searches for another cigarette, only to find the last pack empty in her breast pocket.  She leans back into the futon, setting the cereal bowl on the peak of her belly.  Her eyes find the mix of gray and black discoloring the once redness of the bowl.  A numbing sense of boredom begins to pulsate in the back of her head.  She thinks of Janice’s phone number.   	Her butt lifts as she reaches for the cordless phone buried in the right pocket of her sweats.  The bowl rolls down the decline of her belly and trips off her crotch onto the carpet.   “Goddamnit!”  She pumps herself up, kicking the bowl, stomping her feet into the ashes as the pulsation evolves, ripens, pops into a mature fuzz of rage. The phone rings.  Her back straightens, body springs.  “Hello!?”  ………  “Oh, hey bro.  How ya doing?”  ………  “Whatchya been up to?”  	………  “Guess what James.”  …  “Guess what.”  ………  “How’d you know?”  ………  “He loves me and I love him.  We’re happy.  We really are.”  ………  “Yeah, he makes me happy.  I love him.”  ……….  “Oh, okay.  I love you.”  ………  “When can I call you?”  ………  “Oh, okay.  Bye.” Her thumb thumps the Talk button releasing an abreactive blister, swelling in the back of her mind.  This fuzz, this blurry rage leaves her with no upshot, no hints of beginnings and endings, only with the pain of not really feeling.  Again, her thumb thumps the Talk button and her thumbs crudely dance across the dial pad, mashing keys with an artful innuendo.  ………  “Hi, Janice.  How are you?”   ………  “So, whatchya been up too?”  ………  “Guess what Janice?  I got a new boyfriend!  His name’s Mike.”  ………  “Yeah.  He’s so nice to me.  He loves me.”  ………  “Yeah.  We’re happy.  Are you happy for me?”  ………  “Oh, thanks.  Yeah, we love each other.”  ………  “Oh, okay.  When’s a good time to call you?” ………  “Oh, okay.  Bye Janice.” She stands still within the ashes, staring into the dial pad waiting for the motley sense, the effervescent, shrill feeling of nothing.  It always comes and goes, but the unique potion, pill, and self-prescriptive sedative lies within empty words.  Once again, her thumbs shoot up the dial pad, absolving any sense of numbness.   ………  “Hi honey!  How are you?”  ………  “I miss you.  Do you miss me?”  ………  “Can you come pick me up?  I’m ran outta Reds.”  ………  “But I need more reds.  I feel depressed.  I need some smokes.”  ………  “You said you’d pick me up.  Don’t you love me?”  ………  “What’s happening to us dear?”  ………  “I don’t have anyone.  Everyone hates me!  I’m going to kill myself.  No one will care!”  ………  “Really, you’ll come over?  I love you so much.  Do you love me?”  ………  “Oh, okay.  Bye honey.” She taps the Talk button and stuffs the cordless back into her pocket.  Her feet still nested within the ashes.  The computer chimes.   “Twila, you’re done!” She scurries over to the computer smearing the ashes into the carpet.  She scrolls down the screen and right-clicks on Amy Grants, Love of Another Kind and clicks the command for its transfer, then clicks the command for Destiny to begin. She walks back over to the pile, picks up the bowl and sits back down at the computer.  She pulls out her lighter and pulls out a butt from the ashes.  Her lips wrap around what’s left of the cigarette as she takes a drag.  The red tip of the Marlboro fades back into the inevitable gray.  She cups the bowl in her hand and sits at the edge of the futon, grabbing the next butt within the bowl.  In between drags, she sings her song, all the while staring at the computer screen; waiting.

      So I just got back from Portland, and BOOM! the blog be alive!  I like it.  Anyways, the misfortune that is my ankle injury didn't stop me from enjoying my time with Laura in Portland, OR.    We stayed at the 5th Ave. Suites which was also housing the remaining members of the Grateful Dead.  Never ran into them, oh well, much too much to do with Laura.....Lindgren, muuuaaaaa hahahahahaha!  We checked out the local Portland scene and then on the second day we took the local MAX Light Rail over to the Japanese Gardens and neighboring Rose Gardens.  I'll spare ya'll the details, but just to let you know it was quite the hike with crutches, yet much worth the workout.  We then rode back to the Center Square and "recooped" for the next day of travel.    We then rented an Explorer and went westward towards the Pacific.  Oregon, if you didn't know, is home to numerous vineyards, so within the beautiful valleys bordered by mountains are family vineyards who offer free taste testing.  The only drawback to this idea is that mundane detail/law known as drinking and driving, darn! :-(  We simply enjoyed each other's company.  We have not had that kind of time together for a long time and I cherished every second.  Oh ya, we went to a sweet Powell's Boookstore and I just recently finished my borrowed copy of Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse 5, so I picked up a copy of Rushdie's, Fury and man is it reading good so far.  The crazy thing about the book is Rushdie's insight to city life and the exact same ideas I had as soon as I started crutching around the city.  Just meant to be I guess :-)  Anyways, gotta go to the bathroom now.  TTYS  The Chris Man

         Though easy to reason His purpose was greater— Our powerful, thundering, heavenly Pater,    Created from the motionless throes of His mind His son the unerring and blessèd: our nadir.            With prophetic speech and calls of endtimes,  (whose speech and calls?)  The son was sent forth to redeem us with wine,  (so water-to-wine is now blood-to-wine?)  Kind blessing, his burden, a gift without peer, A so-said deliverance from sin for all time.  (but didn’t Jesus himself tell us this?)     People unthinking and vested in cheer Unknowing and sobbing their various tears. Nearing their ends and divining the why— Said God killed his own to rend from us fear.  (This stanza has the most direction since it works with our right to reason which could also be our downfall in the end)    Though easy to reason his purpose was greater— The child the nadir the gift, may we mind Descended with no greater desire nor drive  (kinda prosy here)  Than to live as a man, as man then to die      I think your poem is still in the stages of ideas becoming something greater.  It needs elaboration and the elaboration needs a vehicle.       I like your last line and I know you do too.    It works beautifully to conclude an argument, but I think your human reasoning is what needs some work.    To me the poem needs an edge for us readers to perch and rest our reading minds.      The tossing-in of the conflict seems unfulfilling.    Jesus as our lowest point in humanity…..I guess my belief comes into interpretation here….I believe Jesus’ coming is one of two most high points in our humanity.    But another belief and conflict comes into play here: human reason vs. God’s unerring plan.    The word Nadir was a hard one to pull off.    I guess my question would be is it God’s lowest point or is it ours?           I would have liked it if you elaborated on our reasoning and found a way to connect your plan of Jesus (God) just wanting to live as a man.    Now that’s a lotta work and I’m not so sure it can be done with the poem set in this day and age or with the fact that God is perfect, so his plan would never fail, so you have to make it seem as though it is working, but once again I am not so sure it works with Christianity.         You could possibly set the poem from a Jewish perspective…just a suggestion…then you could make the poem more of a parable instead of you just kind of pointing us towards your idea or goal.    I just think you need to build a better argument, since you are going up against, well let’s face it, The Word of God.         Maybe to make it work better is to, as I suggested, make it a parable but also make it more comical/light-hearted.    Jesus, sitting at the right hand of the Pater telling everyone in heaven via a parable what he wanted to do instead and/or the parable relates to the delusive practice of human’s of which we call reasoning.    I am saying this because I feel it is necessary for me as a Christian to remind you of what you are toying around with (our salvation) and what a bunch of other minds have done too.             You could bring in other writers’ perspectives within Jesus’ Last Parable.    Jesus could address the Father as Pater, which in turn could be your second line because I think that, “ Our powerful, thundering, heavenly Pater,”  doesn’t do so much for the Chris Man.               I like the word/line     “divining the way.”     It reminds me of devising, so it seduces me into the error of our ways but how we mask it with hyperbolic words.    This ties in with the idea of illusions.  Who is actually talking?  Jesus?  Satan?  Who is this being talking to?  Us?  Everyone in heaven, hell and earth?  This could make a great short story.  Or epic poem! ;-)  I think deception give the readers that chance to decide what they want to believe, because that is, afterall, what God has given us the ability to do.           I hope y suggestions help.    I believe the poem would work much better being comical and also as a parable possibly being told by the deciever himself... (I say possibly because that is what we the readers will have to decide).    To me  it is depressing to think that we just made up Jesus intentions.  Because without Him we’re in the dark forever.    I’m not just saying this as a Christian, because the Bible itself, as I am sure you know refutes your poem.    With that, I think you need to either work with it or against it (which I do not recommend).    Working within the confinements of the Bible and using Satan as a subversive deception could give this an edge for the reader not to rest on (as stated before) but to die upon if they fail to make the right choice.  Your beliefs are yours, but I just wanted to let you know how my beliefs interacted with your poem and I am sure others would too.    It was hard to grab the idea that Jesus just wanted to die or live as a man without trying to save his people.    That would be a worldy/selfish ideal not vested within our Lord.             Maybe I need clarification on your intentions, but when I first read that last stanza of yours,                                                                 Though easy to reason his purpose was greater—                             The child the nadir the gift, may we mind                             Descended with no greater desire nor drive                             Than to live as a man, as man then to die      I wanted to agree with the fact that yes, He wanted to live as a man and then to die as a man so he could be our way to heaven, but not with the idea that he just wanted to walk amongst us for the sake of walking.    Maybe that’s what you want me to do?????         I just think with your vantage point it is hard to argue.    We should get together and discuss this further, especially before me and Laura take off!    I would love to talk about this notion you have and what can be done with it.  And with what you want to do with it.      Very interesting ideas Kris.  You never cease to amaze me with your intellect and insight.  Keep writing!

       Glad to hear that everyone is doing well (minus Chris, who has failed to report in the past while).    I remember you complaining about the cost of a ticket to get up to AK, Erik, how did your friend manage to do it?  Did he do it on a whim?  Or had you been planning it for some time now?  Sarah, glad to hear that you're getting settled in Ames.  I have to say that I agree with Erik and distrust the four-letter city name, but I'm sure you'll soon establish yourself so that everyone knows of presence.  And I wouldn't worry about not finding the transvestites yet, you're probably just not sure which type they are: the man-woman, woman-man.  Speaking of which, I remember being in Córdoba, Argentina and saw this hot woman in the back of a pickup truck driving down the road, showing off her thong.  We approached only to find a wigged man.  We were duped.  Though these words may live on infamy, that was still one fine pair of buttocks (shaved, mind you, as I imagine most men to have some unsightly hair).  I revised my poem that I posted over a month ago.  New comments are welcome.  The theme which I hope to stick to (if you can help in anyway, please post in reply) is:  God comes to earth as Jesus, man decides that Jesus was here to save us, Jesus (God) decides that he just wanted to live as man.  Suggestions, ideas, comments are helpful.  Some rhythmic lapses are hopefully cleared up (view the former draft for what I'm talking about).  Though easy to reason His purpose was greater— Our powerful, thundering, heavenly Pater, Created from the motionless throes of His mind His son the unerring and blessèd: our nadir.  With prophetic speech and calls of endtimes, The son was sent forth to redeem us with wine, Kind blessing, his burden, a gift without peer, A so-said deliverance from sin for all time.  People unthinking and vested in cheer Unknowing and sobbing their various tears. Nearing their ends and divining the why— Said God killed his own to rend from us fear.  Though easy to reason his purpose was greater— The child the nadir the gift, may we mind Descended with no greater desire nor drive Than to live as a man, as man then to die.

      Oh, I'm glad to hear you had a nice little break Erik.  It sounds like Alaska is amazing.  I am getting kind of settled in here.  The area is very nice and homey.  It has a really relaxed feel, and let me tell you the produce is amazing.  The best fruit I've ever had in my life, and the corn on the cob is to die for.  I know my way around the main parts of town, but I haven't gotten the in on the local favorites yet.  I figure that will come once school and everything starts.  You should totally come to school here.  It could be "Sarah and Erik's wild adventures take two."  I've got a couch now, so you always have a place to crash.  I hope everyone is doing well.  Take care.  Sarah

      hey sarah,  glad to hear you're al set up in Ames, I never really trusted towns with less than 5 letters in their names, but maybe ames will prove me wrong...  you must let us know your situation once you get settled in... how do you like your place?  are there any cool hangouts you've found yet?  have you found where the transvestites hang out?  hope all is well with everyone.  my buddy john just came up to see me and i had a week off of work, it was awesome, did a bunch of hiking and stuff.  saw some bears...good time, talk with you all soon  erik

      Hey Guys: I just got hooked up to the internet here in Ames, Iowa.  I am so surprised that I was able to do it myself.  The guy said it was easy, but I've been known to make an easy task a pain in the ass.  Anyway, I skimmed through the last five blogs, and they seem bitchin.  I'm going to have to go into them with more detail in the next day or so in the efforts to once again strip Erik of his conservative beliefs and let my liberal light shine.  I'm kind of busy getting things together right now, but a good indepth blog response will come soon.  I hope things are going well for everyone.  I just talked to Sharla.  She is moving in about a week to California.  And, Kyle is getting ready for graduate school in Fargo.  Peace out.     My address is 606 Luther Drive Apartment #225

      Thanks kris for the explanation, you make a good case for Ullyses which I will tackle one of these days.  I'm currently reading Dosty's "Demons" (previously translated as "The Possessed") and so am mired in a world of complex human interactions the cause of which are rarely explained.  The actions come about as results of feelings, emotions, and impulses which the characters cannot themselves understand.  I find this trend in my life and must assume it happens to everyone.  Emotions cannot be logicaly analyzed, they can be viewed objectively at a later date but if you have ever tried to console a grieving parent, or befriend someone in the thralls of depression (and we won't even get into the realm of love), or have been in these states yourself, then you know that these emotions move with the force of glaciers, inexorably onward towards some final complexing resting place.  Which brings me to my statement concerning the comprehension of the inner workings of one human being being the key to understanding all forms of human interactions within the family, community, nation, and world.  for, just as a person is a single entity, so too is  a people  a single entity which is motivated and driven by the same elemental passions as each of those people from which it is comprised.  in summation:  What is faith and why does it compel?  What causes emotional pain, or emotional satisfaction? What is the driving force behind greed, envy, and hate?  What factors combine to create the sensation of love?  Tell me this, and show me the world.  ok, sorry guys for the high handed language used in this post, but I think after 3 years of writing for professors I feel the urge to get wordy, and you guys are my outlet.  I realize this is so much verbal mumbling, and what i am trying to say could probably be summed up more efficiently with a certain popular phrase from the GI Joe cartoons but I thank you for your time.   ps.  Kris I agree with you, trying to solve the human condition is impossible, much akin to trying to dig a hole to china, all we can do is look at what has taken place, show remorse for the mistakes we've made, and try our hardest to avoid them in the future.  peace erik
