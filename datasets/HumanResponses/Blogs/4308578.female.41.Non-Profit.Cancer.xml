       Remember that old saying years ago? I believe it was somewhere in the 70's I first started hearing it. Being a teenager in the 70's was really a great time in my life. Those were the days that you could leave your keys in the car in your driveway. You never had to worry to much about perverts or child molesters preying on your children while they played outside. We all ate dinner together usually at the same time every evening. Dad's were good men who worked hard and provided for the family.Alot of Mothers stayed home and raised the kids and cooked and cleaned.God, how I miss those days!! It was such a vital part of my life sometimes I wonder where I went wrong.     Around the age of 14 is probably the age things started to change for me.I was starting to like boys for other reasons besides beatin them at HORSE on the basketball court,or showing them that a girl could hit a homerun. I remember my first real boyfriend. I was 15 and my Mother had told me I wasn't allowed to date until I was 16. It was March,two months before my 16th B-day. For the 2 months before March I had been seeing John w/out my Mother knowing. Finally giving in She told me John and I could go out. I won't bore you with the details but lets say I left that relatinship with Cherry Still Intact. Being raised in a Catholic family I was never really told too much about sex. So fear was the only feeling I had towards it.    Many years and six kids later and over 30 yrs old here I sit reminising about the past and realizing there "was" a good time in my life, but it was long ago. I continued through life experimenting with alot of things pertaining to the title of this Blog, you know SEX,DRUGS, and ROCK-N-ROLL. The only one that really messed me up was the drugs. It started out small with a joint here and there with friends then soon it was a line of this or a line of that. Little by little I was relying on these things to make me feel good and to knub the pain of alot of hurts that were tearing me apart inside. I went on through life thinking that this was the only way to cope with what life dealt to me. I thought I needed "DOPE TO COPE"      The longest relationship I had was with a man {and I use that term lightly } whoswept me off my feet when I was 19 years old. What a fool I was then. The only thing that came out of it that was good was 4 of my 6 beautiful children. He was an abuser and an alcoholic. He progressively got worse over the 10 years we were together. The final straw was when he decided that we couldn't live in society anymore so he had this wonderful idea that we were going to move way up North and live off the land. BOY was he whacked!!! We went up North to Wisconsin and he proceeded to pick a spot in one of the National Forests for us to bed down for the night then he started to drink. To make a long story short.me and my 4 kids, ages 5,4,2, and1 found ourselves running through dense forest to get away from him. We just ran into the night not fearing any wild animal for we knew that what was chasing us was far worse than anything we would encounter in the woods. We managed to hide from him in some bushes along the side of the first road we came to. We waited for what seems like an eternity just hoping a cars headlights would appear so we could run out of the bushes and get some help to get away from this madman. No car came. I was just about to give up hope, scratching the numerous mosquito bites we had gotten waiting in the bush, when I heard a noise. I wasn't sure what it was but I was hopeful. It was a man on a bicycle. I stopped himand briefly told him of my plighth and he told me that it was strange because he wasn't going to ride that evening but something made him change his mind and he wasn't sure what it was but he continued to say he knew why now!! Strange how somethings happen . We were rescued by the Wisconsin State Police and we returned home to my family sometome shortly thereafter. My life was in shambles by then. DRUGS,DRUGS,and MORE DRUGS were my only way of killing all the pain and regret I had in my heart.I thought I would never survive, but I did. I continued on what I call now my slow road to suicide but it failed I lived.    I have been clean now for almost 5 years. I have experienced things that would make a normal persons hair curl. I'm writing this now because I want people to know just how bad drugs can be and the consiquences you will have to live with the rest of your life. Below is a list of the consequences of the use of illegal drugs:Felony Record for intent to manufacture;Dentures at the age of 40;loss of custody of 5 out of my 6 children;Neurological problems including weird ticks and constant tightening and grinding jaw. It really all sucks!! I could go on but I'm running out of room. I guess the message I a trying to send out is "DOPE IS FOR DOPES" "DON"T DO DRUGS" Take it from an expert who knows.
