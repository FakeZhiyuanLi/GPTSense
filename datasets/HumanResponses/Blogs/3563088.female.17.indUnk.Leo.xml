       I was talking to my Zia today and I was telling her about Daniel. She told me that she hasn't seen me so happy since before my dad passed away. She knows I'm usually pretty bubbly and happy but she said that now she can see that there's more of a reason in me to be that way. Diana said that she's never seen me so happy in a long time too. I know I am but it's weird for me to say that. But anyways, my Zia said something to me that made me stop and seriously think. She said that sometimes in life when we loose people, they're replaced in other ways, with other people. Now obviously nobody can ever replace my dad. But Daniel's the person that's brought me back to where I was somehow. I don't know how and I know that he has no idea that he's done that but the way he makes me feel has done it. I've been really happy always but I'm a little bit more, lately and it's because of him! I tend to blow things up a little bit. Realistically speaking he does make me happy and he is really important to me. I think the reason why he’s brought me back a little bit is because thinking about him has taken my mind off of thinking about the loss of my dad. I don’t really think about him a lot and sometimes I feel so terrible about that. When I go to bed at night and stare up at the ceiling I always feel so bad for not being able to pray and say thank you to God for everything and everyone in my life. After my dad died I didn’t lose faith in my religion, I just realized that life and death is more powerful than any faith. But since I decided that I kind of feel lost. If you have nothing to believe in who are you? My mom always shoves her beliefs in my face and tries to make sense of them. But how can I believe something that inside I just don’t believe. To me the bible is just a bunch of stories. Perhaps the people were real and maybe their intentions were purest of pure but instead of reading about how good it was I prefer to try to be good in my life. I don’t even know what good is. So really I’m talking bull right now. But there are so many questions and so many answers to those many questions. I don’t feel like going through my life undecided about things and confused about them too. Whenever I think about this stuff I aggravate myself so much.

       12/04/04   Tonight I was on the phone until 4 am with my friend Ramin. He’s my best guy friend. I can’t imagine my life without him, I love him so much. We always have the best conversations and we always have so much fun together. I respect him so much. He’s never touched drugs and he never drinks. I’ve never done drugs but I occasionally will drink something small if I’m at a party or something. But it’s so nice to talk to someone who knows who they are and who has enough confidence not to drink or do drugs. He always makes me laugh and he always knows when I’m upset or mad or really happy. He can always see through me. When people can really see how I’m feeling I know they’re true friends. I do have a bit of a set exterior because I don’t like to be sad, so I try my hardest to be happy. He sees through that and I love that I can tell him anything. I could trust him with my life because I know he’s the most caring person. I can’t express how much fun I have with him. He makes me laugh more than anyone. I always tell him how much I love him and how I’m so proud of him because he’s pursuing a career in sports broadcasting and he’s doing so well.   22/04/04   It amazes me how quickly life goes from so horrible to so perfect in the matter of a day. I think sometimes, that I'm the luckiest person. I've had the most terrible week. With all the chaos, misunderstandings and misinterpretations I was so stressed out. The people you love most are the one's that drive you the most insane sometimes and it's the people who you love the most that give you the hardest times. I love my friends more than anything but they're so stupid sometimes. Sometimes they say and do things that are so ignorant that I’m actually speechless. I have so many friends and I'm so lucky to, but I wish there was a way that I could be with all of them without any of them being so ill-mannered. Anyways, the whole point is my friends did something that I'm just ashamed to know them for and my boyfriend was being the most insensitive thing ever! I can’t be mad at him because I do understand where he is coming from. I hate being able to see things from both sides so much sometimes. Boys are stupid and not considerate at all! So that whole situation has completely made me irritated and upset and annoyed! Anyways things took a turn last night...the most important thing being my acceptance into university! I'm so happy now, I can't explain it. It's such a big load of pressure of my mind now. I'm just SO happy with everything.   28/04/04     Someone said to me today that happy people are just people who don't see the truth. I know I'm really happy but I see the truth about things. I see the bad parts that come with the good things in life. There are so many bad things in this world. There are so many bad people who are selfish and don't care about anybody else. He said that the only way you can get ahead in life is by looking out for yourself. He also said something pretty rude to me about something I had to do for a class. I couldn't believe that he could say something so mean and have no guilt about it. I don't understand why people have to knock other people down. I think it's so sad that this person is that way. I know that they’re hurting right now and that's why they are so miserable and put everybody else down. I laugh at how I have patience to be with people who never feel bad about things the way I do. He can be really funny and very supportive and caring but other times they turn into this mean, mean person. I try to be a good friend to them but I don’t know. He can be weird sometimes. I'm just a “happy person who doesn't see the truth”, to him. The problem is I care too much about how other people feel. I want everybody to be happy but that's not possible because not everybody can see things the way I do. I think I'm pretty lucky that I can overlook the bad things. I don’t think it’s bad that I can be happy despite the unfortunate things in life. My mom always tries to make me feel guilty about that. I can't stress enough how many good things there are in my life, how many positive people I encounter everyday and how much love there is in my family. I don't care about ignorant people who can't accept things for what they are and move on to more important and happier aspects of their lives. I feel sorry for them but not enough to support their ways of dealing with it.   30/04/04   The strangest things happened to me today. I was on my break at work and decided to sit in the food court and read a magazine I’d bought. A guy came by my table and asked me if I’d mind if he sat down. I said I was going to leave soon trying to get him to say never mind that. But he said he’d really like to sit down. I said okay but there were so many other empty tables I was kind of freaked out. He asked me what my name was and I pointed to my name tag. He laughed and said his name was Matt. I was just about to get up when he asked me if I’d give him my phone number. He looked a lot older than me and I have a boyfriend so I said I was sorry. As I began walking he murmured “I guess I just met the prettiest Ashley.” I was a little bit stunned that he said that and I did turn my head around and smile. It was just the strangest thing ever. He seemed nice and everything but how often does someone call you the prettiest?! A woman came into the body shop and asked me what products I use on my face and my hair etc. I was kind of surprised that she asked me only what I used to I began showing her products. Whenever I’d say that a product was popular or that everyone loved it she’d ask what my opinion was and if I’d use it. I was scared that the lady was a mystery shopper so I said all good things. She bought quite a bit of stuff. As I was ringing in the sale she said “I asked you what you use because you have a very sweet look to you. You look like you live a good lifestyle and it looks like you really take care of yourself. I said thank you but I was really shy I couldn’t look at her. Then she said to me “You have beautiful eyes and hair and you have a very nice smile. I’d do anything to look like you.” I kept saying to myself, what in the world is wrong with this woman. My co-worker told me that I shouldn’t think like that because a lot of people look at me that way. I was really confused where all of these nice comments were coming from today. I feel pretty crappy today too. I think it’s funny when people compliment me because I never take it seriously I just laugh.

        03/05/04             What’s wrong with being independent? I like finding things on my own. I like going places without ever being there and finding my way. I like to discover the truth for myself. I like to work really hard to find answers because when I do find them, they mean something to me. I hate that my mom always tries to show me the easy way out. I don’t want to take the easy way all the time. I want to be challenged. I want to experience what it means to really try, really fail and really succeed. Whenever I fail she makes it the biggest deal but then when I succeed she ignores it. I went to York University with her and we were trying to find the Ross building and I was walking around just trying to look around. She kept saying I didn’t know where I was going and I should ask someone. I had a map though and I have a pretty good sense of direction. She pointed out that my dad was like that. He would never ask for help. She said he was “too proud” to ask anybody for help. I’m not too proud to ask I just hate bothering people and I like the challenge of doing something myself. In my eyes I just think that if I get lost I don’t see it as a huge deal. I can always find my way. I don’t mind having to walk around to find a place. The only way to find things is to get lost anyways. That’s what I think. It’s so disgusting that she always tries to make me feel like I don’t know things but she does. She knew as little, if not, less, as I did about the Keele Campus of York. What’s the big deal that I want to go on my own and want to experience York for what it is? Yeah, I might be a little scared with so many people around and yeah maybe I won’t be completely comfortable there alone. The only way to learn is to go ahead and do it and learn if you make a mistake.   09/05/04   My mom and I have a really strange relationship. We’re very passionate people and I love her as much as I can be mad at her. I’m sure it’s the same for her. In the last year I’ve had so much difficulty trying to get through to her that I’ve just given up. She can say whatever she wants about me, talk me down as much as she possibly can and try to overshadow my achievements; I’ve learned to tune her out of my head. I’ve had to do that because I can’t live a healthy life thinking those things of myself. I know the things she says aren’t true but when you hear them so many times you’re so scared that you’re going to believe them. I do work hard; I do my best in everything I do. I’m not the best though and there are only 24 hours in a day. I can’t be a maid to other people around me, I can’t sit in a house all the time and never go out, I can’t do everything she wants me to and I can’t let her make my decisions. She doesn’t understand those things and that’s why our relationship has suffered so much. A lot of the trust isn’t there anymore because the mutual respect that’s supposed to be there isn’t.

       Mrs. Selvaggi wrote little quotes, sayings and poems for students on the day of exams and this was the prayer she wrote for me:  God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.   My mom and dad bought a plaque when they got married with this prayer on it. It was a funny coincidence.      Little Favourite Quotes     "Go confidently in the direction of your dreams. Live the life you have imagined. " Henry David Thoreau  "The only way to avoid being miserable is not to have enough leisure to wonder whether you are happy or not."

Unknown  "…some scars are meant to be worn with pride…" A Lesson Lived Is A Lesson Learned by Hatebreed  "I Love you not for who you are, but who I am when I'm with you" Unknown  "Your success and happiness lie in you. External conditions are the accidents of life, its outer trapping. The great, enduring realities are love and service."      "Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. Work without joy is nothing. Resolve to keep happy, and your joy and you shall form an invicnceble host against difficulties." Helen Keller  "Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome trying to succeed. " Booker T. Washington  "Gratitude is the key to life. It unlocks each day's gifts for you. At the beginning of each day give thinks for all you have experienced."  "Directed-select a goal and move toward it.

        Given    I’d give you my health.  It’s not something I need.  I’d give you my eyes.  You’d be able to see things differently.  I’d give you my naïve nature.  You’d be able to be grateful for things without guilt.  I’d give you my ability to appreciate.  You’d value what you have so much more.  I’d give you my heart.  You’d be able to feel how much I love you.  I wish you could feel, see and hear what I do.  You deserve so much more than what you’ve been given.  For the person you are, I love you and I just wish I could give you that understanding.   Revolving   I want to help you.  I need to see you happy, my happiness depends on it.  I show concern.  Nobody else encourages you.  I’m the only one who smiles at you.  I can make you laugh.  I tell you the truth.  I open up to you.  I see when you’re sick.  I’ve always been amazed at your courage.    Can I go now?    It’s kind of like fate.  You meet once, you meet twice.  Unintentionally.  Does that mean there’s more to this than what I was originally thinking?  I didn’t mean to do this.  It wasn’t in my control.  I seen what I wanted and I got it.  I’m so used to getting what I want.  I want to let it all go.  You realize things too late.  You want things too soon.  Running away isn’t an option.  Running will hurt and running will ruin.  So walking through above the fire,  below the water.  It’s here.  Can I go now?   25th    It’s important to me,  more than you.  Always assuming the worst.  Cushion my heart before it descends;  against the frustration of my wishes.  Embracing the fall,  of falling in your eyes.  You don’t see.  I feel the disappointment.  All you mean to me;  You missed it.  Knowingly.  It doesn’t make it any easier.  Oblivious to my affection and the purpose of us.   Constraint   I find it strange as I lie in my bed.  As I lie and watch,  the minutes change.  6:42, 6:43…  And I think…  I’ll never get that minute back.  It’s written in the book of me,  my history.  In the contrived world we live in,  the clock controls life.  It makes accurate estimations of what my life will become in the next minute,  The time is fickle.   Relief   Becoming bitter    About the limits About the oppression  It feels as if I have no limbs to pull myself out I can’t push and I can’t pull  But when I’m alone I think I’m invincible Strong enough to overpower those limits Enough to break out  And so what if I fall I’m not afraid to bleed    …And the Negative      The light of the sun The serene green The glorious breeze The uplifting sounds of life It’s beautiful to me The only way life should be  The stench of over consumption The colours of rot The sounds of destruction The clouds of black staring upon shadows of death The only way it really is   A Rest   I’m stuck here.  Not going far.  Fixed in my solace.  I created it on my own.  Against my will, I walked into a corner.  At least I can rest  A rest. In arrest.     And There He Is         A walk to the long brick walls. Standing outside Vulnerable and alone  I cross paths of those who are gone I walk by the stones engraved Those who are only remembered by dates The dates carrying the memories of the people who knew them  I open the door to the building where he lies And there Jesus is Asking me to love    Asking me to believe    As I walk to my destination The sunshine strikes me as I pass each window Tinted like my emotions  Yellow Orange Red  The date stares me in the face I remember It carries my memory It carries me along, despite its memory But there he is Asking me to love Asking me to believe And there he is     Replication   So bored So annoyed Day by day  With routine With ignorance Hour by Hour  For no reason For all reason Complaint after complaint  Occupy my world Occupy my concern Piece by piece  Fill me with things to do Fill me with things I did last week Over and Over.   Sparkling    Often painful. Sometimes repetitive. Usually agonizing, continuously disappointing, senselessly confusing, deepening culpability.  It’s in me now. It’s tainted my life. I know what she thinks Of me, Why me, How me, An obstacle that lives beside you that you lived inside. All because perfect never feels so perfect.     As   As he holds my hand,  I can’t feel anything else.  As he kisses me,  I become oblivious to things around me.  As I bury my face into his shoulder,  I get lost in his presence.  As I look at him,  I can’t help but feel so lucky.  As I listen to him,  I can’t help but marvel at his uniqueness.  As I squeeze him in my arms,  I can’t imagine how it would be if he wasn’t there.   Leaving Carr   There’s not much time left.  It’s going to be a memory soon.  Just the way writing this will be a memory.  This is the last May 13 I’ll be here.  My life is going to shift after June.  It will not be apart of my life.  It’s going to be so difficult to turn the direction on that first day.  I’ll be facing north, not south of my home.  But its place has a sort of significance.  It is north, it is up, it is positive, it should be.    I Use to be    Shy, embarrassed, introverted,  Uncomfortable situations presented to me,  Thrown out immediately.  Not enough to prove me strong,  Just enough to prove me wrong.   So    The sun doesn’t seem so bright  The rainbow isn’t so colourful  The moon isn’t as encompassing  The stars just aren’t so many  The sky isn’t as clear  The water isn’t so tranquil  The land isn’t so vast  The fruits aren’t as sweet  The tiny flowers aren’t so lively  Since you left   The Possibility to Exist   Consider the possibility  Defining not within the definition  Developing without a system  Growing without supports  Anchoring within water  Rebelling over the rebels  Fitting into all of the patterns  Peace within those pieces  As we drift we slowly fall apart  into the existence  set up for us in a system of life   Matters      Don't care about your eyes  Don't care about your hair  Forget about your smile  Forget about that colour  Don't care about the way you look  It doesn't matter if you don't believe it  It only matters if you see it  It only matters if you think it's true  It's relevance will only matter if you feel it  If not,  They'll be worth less than the gifts themselves       Season of Life   Conception; a glitter, a glimmer or potential    A fresh burst, a ray of hope  Childhood; freedom, careless abandon. Not a worry in the world, greens and golds, swimming in   the sea of wonder, flying in the sky of curiosity  Now, the loss of wonder and ideals, betrayal at every turn, holding on to what you need to let go,  Resistance of the righteousness of written rules  Fighting the system at every turn  While harsh lessons, learned too late to shake the path  Conforming to the beliefs of others in order to belong  Adulthood; difficulty, confusion, putting into practice lessons you’ve learned, living an endless   routine, nine to five day in and day out  Obsessive, lust for control  Gradually material possessions displace ideals as the centre of your life  The spirit shrivels along with the body and mind  Your days are numbered your own morality becomes clear  A hidden desire to become what you once were  A fork in the road: destiny and demise  Bitterness grows as the reality of tainted intentions and loss of innocence prevails     ...written By Mrs. Selvaggi's Writers Craft Class: 2004 :o)  (    ps- last line is mine! hehe)      They   They come, they go    They've came, they're leaving  Torment in itself, through red fury  Watching the inflictions of loss and arrival  take over emotion  Loss of a stable mentality  Leavin behind the ability to reason  Walking away from the ignorance  after running towards it  Happy to exclude  Never wanting to see  Glad to be able to   Vice    I can't ask these questions  Because I should know the answers  I need to hear someone else answer them so I know I'm right  It's my vice; my insecurity in my existence  It will take years to find the truth  As many years as it will take to find me  I don't know what I'm capable of  I don't see what my ability has reached  Everything will go wrong and begin to fall apart  Because I wasn't able to see  Those boundaries have lead me to lose that feeling             The Notion of Expectation    My mind will wander as there's nothing it is fixated on.    There's no verbal assurance there for me to feel secure.    Nothing.    And it's not the fault of him or me.    It's the notion of expectation that I blame.    The unsure feelings haunt me as I hear the things I want, from the wrong people.    They mean nothing as they come from the wrong source.    They are life's way of teasing me.    But if it bothered me so much I wouldn't want to be with him so bad.    With every relationship comes sacrifice.     I've sacrificed things that I realize, I don't really need and never lead me to feel secure to begin with.   Forgetting        Did you forget that it was over a year ago?      No need to act as if it was more than what it is.      Because it was over when it ended.      To release your anguish you relive it, in your words.    To realize you were wrong, is what brought you to your knees.  In search of a certain answer,  you let me down and I wish I had never laid eyes on you.  Overthrowing the emotional inflictions upon yourself,  you lost track of time.  In that time I moved on.  In that time you stayed still.  I found what I wanted and what I was lucky enough to see.  So leave me in my happiness.  Your life will come to you, you can't hold back people from your past.

           13/ 07/04        Everything is so weird. I noticed last week that everytime my family life begins to turn sour, every other aspect of it turns into this amazingly lucky and blessed one. My mom has her control issues as she always has and it's been a bit difficult to stay patient with her and take things slowly. This week when she realized how much more independant I'd like to be, she began making every single minute that we spend together unbareable. I can't stand the nagging, the complaining, the yelling that she starts. So I just avoid her. I leave the room when she walks in, I put headphones or loud music on when she looks like she's going to talk to me, I pretend I don't care about things she says when she does talk. I do that bit and it's not hard. It's really easy actually. It's just that I wish things didn't have to be that way. I want to share my happiness with her but she hates that I am happy. When she found out I got this new job she knocked it every which way possible: it's far, it's too busy, the people aren't going to be nice, i'm going to turn into a snob, i won't be able to work at night during school. None of those thing's are true anyways. But I hate how she just can't support my decisions and be happy for me. This is what I want and I just wish she could be happy with me. I wish I could give her some of my luck, some of my blessings. I know she hates that I am lucky. She said to me that I shouldn't think I was born under a lucky star because I wasn't. But I think I was. I have so much and I have so many people around me whom I love and who love me back; that's why I'm lucky.  I'm really mad at her for what she's done to my sister and I. She's made it so that I can't be with my other family without having problems with her. She's brainwashed my sister into thinking that they are bad people and that they are not her family. She shouldn't have done this. It really tore my love for her apart. I still love her because she's my friend and my mother. But she's ruined a part of my life that I can never get back. It makes me sick knowing the only way I can love both my families is if I'm not close to either side in fear that the other will be upset. Mainly just my mom's side. Over money and misunderstanding.  Everytime it gets like this with my mom I start getting really sick. I get really bad headache's like those ones that just pound in the back of my eyes and I have this nautious feeling. I flex my stomach up into knots and I don't work out and I eat more. It's weird. It's my nerves just going out of whack because it all makes me so sick. Nobody should ever have to feel like this with their families. That's why I love my dad's side so much. They never ever made me feel this way. I miss them a lot. But I miss my dad the most.  I want to go see him so much but I'm so scared. I don't know what I'm scared of though. I don't want to go with my family because I need to think and I need to be normal and not cry and not be stupid. I need a sense of calm and peace with him. My mom always freaks out and my nonna always starts praying. The two things I'm unsure of the most in myself. I can't pray because I don't know what I'm praying for anymore. I hate how people always pray when they need something but they never pray just to say thank you and I support the way you decide life itself has to be. I'm one of those people sometimes. Anyways that's why I don't want to go to the cemetary with them. So I guess until I can go on my own, I won't be going. Which is fine. I just have to be patient and not get caught up in it.   15/07/04   It's my mom's birthday and I'm so mad at her. I hate that she makes me hate her. She says so many bad things and I don't know what to say back. She was telling me that me and Daniel won't last through university and I should break it off so I don't get hurt. I can't BELIEVE she would ever say anything like that to me. I'm trying so hard to be nice and just not say anything. Being with him has made me a lot happier than I've been in a long time. I've tried for a year like my family told me to, and I still wish I could leave. But that's the thing; it's just a wish. Another thing, my sister is completely changing into someone, it's not who I grew up with. She is so screwed up and it's all my mom's fault. She won't be alone ever, she follows me or my mom if we ever leave a room, she fights and argues her way out of doing things. It's just all so bad. I can't stand to see her grow up into this kind of person. But I can't do anything because she'll only tell my mom things I tell her and she'll never understand things about my dad or the way he taught me to be.  Today my mom got a call from the lawyer telling her she wasn't going to get the shares her and my father had because the government was taking it to pay off all my dad's debts. My dad was really bad with money, he spent it like it was nothing and that's why he had so many stresses with his business. He didn't know how to handle it and therefore he buried himself deeper and deeper over the years with all of my parents' finances. Anyways my mom is so mad she started arguing with me about it. I do and don't agree with the government taking the money because they shouldn't attack the families of the deceased for their debts, especially when it involves children. But I do agree because he owed A LOT and if they did not get it from where they should've through taxes etc. that's a lot of money that could help the community. I donno maybe I'm wrong but I just think it's money. We'd probably only use it for things like clothes and other stuff. I didn't have that money to begin with so really I haven't lost anything.  I miss the way things used to be with my mom and I but it's never going to be the same ever again. I live here and I talk to her and I'm civil but if I could, I'd leave and have a very distant relationship with her. That's the only way I could truly appreciate her. I just want her to be nice again and stop trying to ruin everything and control my decisions. I know she hates me and she can't stand me, she's told me to my face, she's friggin given me the finger for goodness sake. When stuff like that happens I just wish my dad was here with me.  I feel so guilty hiding this from people. The only people who really know how I feel are Vince, Danny, my dad's brothers and sisters, Amanda, Diana and Gianna. I haven't ever told Dan about the probs I have with my mom because I don't think he'd understand and I don't want him to change his opinion of her because she's nice to him. I came close to telling him a bit about it but I just couldn't talk about it anymore. I felt this weird feeling almost like I was spreading rumors or ruining her reputation or something. I felt so guilty but I don't know if he could ever understand how much she hurts me. My dad's family understands because he used to tell them about how he felt trapped, how she made him just want to die, how she made everything so miserable, how she always made everything about her, how she always attacked him emotionally just how she made him feel just so fucking bad. She does it to me now that he's gone but she always criticises him even though he's gone. She always says things like "Who bought you everything? Not your father!". I hate when she does that it makes me want to just cry. I'm not going to let her do this to me. I'm stronger than that and I don't need her idiocy to ruin my ambitions. I'm very determined to win this whole thing. I'm putting on the bravest face but inside I know I'm weak and that's what makes her win all the time. I won't let her ruin my future. I'm taking what I can get, what is mine, what I deserve, what my dad left me, and I'll never look back because she's never going to accept me or what I want.   21/07/04   My zia Rosa came to visit me at work today. It was funny because I walked by the entrance and I could only see the top of a womans head as there was a chair in front of me, and as she walked I thought "maybe it's her" and it was! I couldn't hold myself. I just kinda ran to her and hugged her. In words, it's impossible to explain how much I wished I could just sit down and tell her everything I've been through with my mom and how my life is going. For that one minute I couldn't let go of her and I really thought I was going to cry. But I held it in because I knew this would be the last time I'd see her before she leaves for Italy. I told her a bit about how tough it's been with my mom, how me and Dan are, how money is for me etc. She told me that my nonna cries all the time and she's lost a lot of weight. She said that she misses my dads phone calls and wishes I would call. But if i call and my mom finds out she's going to hate me. She told me that the picnic wasn't the same without me and that Adam was kind of moping around wishing I was there. It kills me so much inside that I can't be with them. I'd give up my life to be able to be with them. I'll never ever forget about them and I'll never ever stop loving them. My love and memory only grows with every day that I go without them in my life. I love them so much. Especially Adam. He was my other half. I love them all so much. There are no words to describe my love for them. I keep getting myself sick because I miss them so much.      28/07/04         I think the worst feeling in the whole world is seeing someone you love in so much internal pain and no matter what you say, how many hugs you give them or how many kisses you give them, nothing can ever make it better. I hate that so much. My friend was so upset about just a bunch of things and I knew exactly how she was feeling. Feeling the way she was, is one of the worst, truly agonizing things someone can feel. I don't know how I got over it when I went through it, I just did. It's like that quote that Tom Riely sayd in the Talented Mr. Ripley. "Wouldn't it be better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody". That is the only way to explain that feeling. It kills to feel unappreciated by people who seek appreciation from. It's the ugliest feeling; almost a type of rejection. I tried to tell that its the people that really show their love for her, that matter and that she should concern herself with. But it's easier said than done, and I know that. I tried so hard to make her feel better, just to make her feel like she wasn't alone and that it was okay to feel that, she just had to control herself. I started balling because I honestly didn't know what else to say or do. I just wished I could run over there to give her a shoulder to cry on. I've haven't felt that bad in a really, really long time.

      I don’t want to say hate. I honestly don’t. But you make me so mad at you. You make me want to shut you out completely. You make me want to cut off all the ties to you. I want to yell at you but I never yell at anyone. You make me cry so much. You make me want to leave every blessing I have just so I can avoid getting hurt by you. You disappoint me. I feel so stupid because I keep trying. But how am I supposed to give up on you? How can I give up on bettering the relationship I want to keep in my life forever? I won’t say hate and I won’t cut you off and I’ll continue to try. I may not be able to fix anything or do much to make you feel better about the bad things but at least see what I see in you. I just want to see you happier. You don’t see what you do to me. You made me physically sick after thinking about things you’d say about me and about everyone. I could never bring myself to say I hated you. I don’t think I could have any less respect for you right now. I’m scraping to keep up my respect for you but it’s dieing so quickly. I hate that I can’t wait to get away from you. I want to love you so much more but you make it impossible for me to gather up the little courage I have and use it to defend myself.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   You made me cry every night when I began to care about you for the very reason of not wanting to cry anymore. You know how much you mean to me. The all-night conversations, the parties, the fun, the connection was so great. I don’t think you could’ve told me anymore that you cared about me and you were so amazed at the friendship. I felt the same. But you drove me insane because you knew that we'd eventually hurt each other. You were trying to protect yourself. You were trying to keep yourself stable enough to maintain more than just me. You knew I cared about you and you shoved your stupid, irregular nature in my face. All you insecurities messed up what we had; it wasn’t my fault in any way. I’m only one person and I couldn’t figure things out for you.  I don't believe in monogamy either. I would never want to be monogamous to someone who couldn't handle feelings. You can't handle any of that stuff because you're just SO screwed up. How could you expect me to give anything to you?  That was all you wanted. I don't care how many times you plead and beg me to believe you. That's what your intention was. That's what made you lose me.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   How can you ask me to do that? How can you sit there with no intention of compromise? I've made so much effort and compromise for you. I do it willingly though because you're special to me. I'm obviously not as special because if I were I wouldn't have to be doing this. I'm so mad and I'm wrong. We are compromising. It's just that it's not what I wanted. I didn't want to compromise what I planned. Why do I have to do that? My plans are finalized and yours aren’t so why am I changing mine? You made it pretty clear what you wanted. What if I want something different? I'm guessing you weren't prepared for that. You don't understand that I hate that I'm doing this to my friends. I hate it more than anything. I balled my eyes out over this enough already. I shouldn't have had to do this. When it comes I won't care anymore all I'll care about is that I'm with you. But you probably won't care as much anyways seeing as you didn't have to compromise anything or leave anybody. If I could tell you this believe me I would.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   It’s only two months. It’s not that serious of an issue. It’s just that it’s nice to recognize that we’ve been together. It’s nothing huge. It's just a little special day! I don’t think it’s so hard to say something nice about it. Why would it be so difficult to say something about it? I don’t understand. I don’t want to be all sappy because you wouldn’t appreciate it and because I’m not really like that. I just like to say sweet things once in a while. Forget about the physical stuff for a minute and look at the emotional side of us. If we did take away the physical, what would be there if we can never say things meaningful to each other? That stuff has to develop but it’s like you don’t even know that there should be an emotional side to relationships. I think this is WEIRD.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   I don’t know how to ignore things that you say to me. You expect me to take things you say lightly because you say them out of anger. If you say something you feel it to some extent. If you think I don’t do anything and I’m lazy go ahead and think that what can I do to stop you? You have no idea the truths I know about you. I seen it for my own eyes now and I’ll never be able to look you in the eyes and accept the things you did to him, to me, to her and to his memory. I think you can be one of the best and one of the worst people I know. You’re blinded by money, by power and by your arrogance. You try to give off the selfless, devoted, sacrificing, loyal image but I know that’s not what you are because you’re not like that with your own family. You’re only like that with people who don’t live with you and haven’t seen your bad side. I shut up when you say mean things and when you put me down and I’ll continue to. But I know that if I ever leave here I won’t look back with any regrets. I’ll leave because that’s the best thing for me to do. The worst thing I could do is stay here and live with the lies, the arguing, the nagging and the disappointment that is you. I appreciate you for when you are a good person and for the sacrifices you genuinely made. But I can never respect you for buying me things, for yelling at me, for telling me I’m not good enough, for putting down my achievements and for the general crap that I’ve learned to put up with since I was a kid. Dad never treated me that way. I’m glad he either said something good or said nothing at all. I appreciate that silence rather than your bickering. Your yelling will echo in my head forever and it echoed in his too. When you put on your cries in that funeral home and when you told me you loved me I’ll never forget those things because they were the fakest things I’ve ever experienced. Everything is a show to you. You want people pity and you want attention and you want the world to revolve around you. I’m glad I’m not like you in that respect. I’d hate myself if I were. I hate that you think you’re like me and that you’re better than I am. You just try to control me and over power me but you know that later on, I won’t be the one crying or the one who’s lost. You’re alone for a reason and I think it’s because you don’t deserve to be loved because everybody who’s ever loved you has had to suffer so much at your hand. I don’t ever want to feel the way you used to make me feel. I’ll never let you win that feeling over me again.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   I just wish more than anything, that you were here. I hate the way I have evolved into a life without you. Coming home to you made me happy. Everything was so perfect but we'll never feel that good again. It'll never be that real. That was the best time in my life and I was the happiest I had ever been. But then it came time for me to lose you and move on. My heart never beat so fast and never stopped beating for so long. You're my angel and my sweetie and I'll love you for the rest of my life more than anything and anyone. Sometimes I just miss you so much. It's not fair that I can never spend time with you ever again. You're only a dream to me now. If I had one wish it would be just to be with you again. That's all I want. I don't care that sometimes you were strict. I remember being mad at you when I was small because you made me eat gross veggies and made me wash dishes. Now I wish I could hear your warnings. I wish you were here so bad. I need you to be here to support me through this. When you sat on my bed and told me I needed to be patient, needed to be happy with what I had, my health and happiness I never could love you or respect you more. I never had to be perfect for you I just had to be a good person and have good intentions. You were a saint, you were the sweetest and most amazing person I ever met. If there is a such thing as a spirit I hope yours is around me at this time in my life where I'm at the end of my rope with those who I should love so much more than I do. I love you so much, please, I hope you are happy and I hope that there is a God holding you and loving you the way you should've been loved when you were here.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   I know we always argue about the "luckiest" and the "cutest" but I can' t tell you how lucky I feel. Your so different from me but we're so alike in so many more important ways. I love spending my time with you not only because I can be myself around you but because I love the security of you and knowing you're there because you want to be. To know you feel the same way I do, is the best feeling in the world. I love that you're just you and that everything is so great when we're together. You're so special to me and I thank God that I have someone in my life who cares. I know you're not verbal about things and neither am I but I hope you know I care about you so much and that I'm so proud to be your girlfriend. I know sometimes I don't tell you things because I'm afraid you won't understand and it's not your fault. I won't tell you because I'm not ready to tell you. I share my happiness with you now because you leave me just as happy. I don't tell you of the bad because you've never come close to making me feel so bad. I'll tell you about the things that hurt me, one day when I think you should know and when you show that you want to know more than anything in the world. Until then, I want you to share in what makes me happy and what I value most in my life. You're one of the things that makes me happy and you are one of the people, aside from family, I value most in my life. You're so incrediably valued as a friend. I'm so happy with you and I couldn't wish for someone or anything else. I love the person I've become as I've been with you. Every kiss and every squeeze has so much more meaning behind it. Without over-reacting, exagerating or thinking unrealistically about our relationship, I hope you know what I know and see that I'm sincerely happy to be yours.  - -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   I miss you all so much. I don't know how I've let my mother dissociate me from my own flesh and blood. I've let my mom take me away from the other ties I have left to my dad, his past and who I am because of him. I'm so sorry I don't have the strength to ignore her so I could be with you too. I want to have both of my families to love. I hate that it's impossible for me to have that ever again. I'm so sorry that I can't do this anymore. I love you all and you mean the world to me. You supported me though the hardest times and the best ones. You've always rooted for me and kept me going in everything that I ever came to a crossing to, in my life. You've always managed to have an impact on me because I respect and care about you all so much. You're always there to make me laugh and you keep me happy when I'm with you all. I never felt so much love as there is when we're all together. I miss you all and I wish I could be with you so bad. I'm sorry, I'm so so so sorry I can't do this for you. I hope you don't hate me. I love you all.

        02/06/04        I went to York today and I was just looking at my schedule. This is my life next year. This is what my life is going to revolve around. Learning and experiencing and new people! It looks like so much hard work but so much fun! I can’t wait to learn and finally be what I set out to be. I remember looking at university sites when I was in grade 10 and just thinking “This is what I want.” I’m so happy that I got here. I knew I could but I had a few challenges along the way. I’m proud that I got over those. If I didn’t and I was watching this time pass me by without excelling I think I’d be really disappointed in myself. I’m happy I sat home on those Friday nights to study, to read, and to get ahead. I’m happy I made those choices to ignore friends when I had work to do because it got me where I am now. I just have to say that I did take that “ignoring friends to get work done”-theory a little too seriously. Whatever, I’m happy I have absolutely no regrets about anything in high school. I achieved something and I can’t wait to go to university and work my butt off there too!       20/06/04      So here I am on Father's day being a baby and again avoiding going to the cemetary. It's been almost a year since I've gone. I've had so many chances and I always don't end up going. Every chance I get is with my family and I don't want to sit there and think about him with them there. They start to cry and sob and pray aloud and I can't do that. Then they look at me as if in their heads their wondering "How could you not be crying and praying?". I think it's some sort of defense mechanism but still, I can't stop being like that. How could you just start being emotional if you don't like to be, in front of people your uncomfortable around? I don't feel the need to explain myself to them, but I know they'd expect one. It's part of teenage brigades of trying to become yourself. I need to develop without judgements shaping me. I miss him so much today. I don't know what's wrong with me today! I'm such a grumphead and I'm so quiet. I don't want to talk to anybody except maybe Dan or Amanda. Especially Dan though because I know he won't bug me about what's the matter. LOL. I'm mean today too!! I keep snapping on my family and it's so ugly. They don't deserve to be snapped at just because I'm in a downer. Who would want to talk to such a grumphead like me today anyways. I hope nobody does. But it's funny because I'll go on msn later and talk to people. LOL. I don't know why I'm in such a terrible mood. I think it's because I miss my dad but I don't know. I'm so tired too. Today I was thinking maybe the reason why the last couple days have been so ugly is because I'm finished school. There's no work for me to do. I don't have to get up at any set time. My routine is gone because school is finished. I know it'll perk up a bit within the next few days but I hate having nothing to look forward to. I put these goals up for myself and I've completed the big important ones (ISU's, Exams, Work). So what's there to do now? I hate this feeling. It's like I'm the biggest, useless, goalless person. I need a challenge and I need something to work towards. Look what the system of life does? I can't go outside and sit and do nothing because I'll feel useless. But that's just enjoying life in it's purity. I'm so disappointed in myself, I thought I'd never feel like this, I'd always have the appreciation for the simple things. I don't know, aren't the little challenges we set up for ourselves simple things in a sense? YUCK. What a grumphead I am, honestly!!!        23/06/04        So it's graduation night tomorrow. I'm so happy high school is finished. I met a lot of great people and have learned so much. But high school made me realize that people aren't all nice and there are mean people who'll try to bring your mood down because they don't like to see others happy. In elementary school and high school we have no choice but to be surrounded by those people; in university it'll be easy to dodge and seperate yourself from those you don't prefer. Thank god! I love my friends with all my heart but I realized how ignorant they can be. It irks me to hear them bad mouth other people that I care about but I never say anything because there's no use in ending things off badly now. I'd much rather prefer everybody to be friends, get along, and graduate in peace. I hate when people start shit so I promised myself not to be one of those people. One of my friends found out she failed a class and can't graduate with us. I felt so bad for her but she honestly didn't deserve to pass because she never did any work or went to enough classes. But my heart really went out to her because I thought that was going to be me. I couldn't bear the thought of failing the goal I set up for myself; graduating and going to university next year. I don't know what I would've done if I couldn't graduate. Seriously I think I'd go into the biggest depression ever. I'm so happy I'm getting out of Carr. It was fun but it's time to move on. I can't wait to begin university. I'm so excited to learn and do all that work and have all that pressure. LMAO. Only me. I'm so happy!!!!! But I'm still really lazy too. lmao God.        27/06/04        Daniel just told me he met my zia's. My mind has basically gone blank and I don't know what to say to him. I wish I could see them more but he has no idea about this whole situation so it's really killing me to talk about them. I miss them so much. I haven't seen them since March and it feels like forever. I want to call them and I want to go see them so bad but I know the second I do, my mom will start her crap again. I don't feel like being yelled at for stupid things just because me loving my other side of the family bothers her. aaaand now I can't stop crying now. lol. I can't tell my mom this because she'd probably hate me and that wouldn't be cool. I don't need her permission to love and see my family but I feel like I'm betraying her if I do. I don't care, late on I know it won't be like this and I won't ever have to worry about it because it'll completely be up to me and she won't know if I see them or not.       28/06/04      Dan mentioned to me last night that my three zia's recognized him at work. I couldn't believe what he was saying because it was so unexpected. I literally sat there for a couple minutes staring at the computer screen in speechlessness. All I could say was omg and what. I haven't really thought about them in a while and I've tried my best to keep in touch but it's so difficult. Not only did their encounter catch me off guard but it was a bit of a slap in the face for me. I need to wake up and ignore my mother. This is my fathers family, I need to be with them and speak to them as much as possible. The problem is she hates when I have any contact with them; phone, person, e-mail..any means of contact she basically despises. She makes me feel so bad when I tell her of them. I know she hates them and I know they hate her. But I wish with all my heart that they wouldn't. I miss my family so much. I miss them making me laugh and I miss them being psycho and I miss all those little kids. I feel like I've divorced my family. I miss them so much. I can't explain how much I just wish I could run to them and never ever come back here. I love my mom and I love my mom's family so much. I'd die for any of them, that's how much they mean to me. My dad's family means just as much to me though. I hate that I can't be with them. There's no balance and I'm afraid one day I'm going to become bitter at them for that, although it's not their faults at all. I need to have both because I'm not just made of one. When Dan told me and I became basically shocked, I started to cry a little bit. I couldn't hold it in anymore but it felt so good to cry for that one second. I needed to let that out really bad. I haven't cried at all for Prom or Grad or even when I cleaned out my locker. But hearing him speak of them made me just ball. I miss and love them all so much. I don't know what to do. I'm so ashamed that I can't overlook my mom's problem with them. I want to make her happy and I hope I am, by being this way and having as little contact with them as possible. Angelo got upset at me for being upset at myself. I am disappointed that I haven't over looked her issue with them and talked to them because thats the right thing to do. He said it's not my fault and I know it's not but I can't blame them? It's up to me to choose and make the balance and I haven't done that. I've thrown myself into school, work, my friends and myself and I've let my family go into the depths of my mom's hate and that's why I'm upset with myself. I miss them so much I found myself e-mailing them telling them how sorry I am and how much I miss and love them. I guess I had a sudden attack of conscience? June 30, 2004 When you can't tell people things because you're afraid to hurt them is it always right? Your preventing others you care about from being offended, hurt etc. and it's not hurting you not to say those things, but is it always the right thing? I look at the things I think about and they're always filled with some kind of regret about my need to keep things to myself. I hate when people do that to me and I especially hate it when they disregard me when they go out or do things but I never say anything. All my failed attempts to be honest go unnappreciated and unnoticed because nobody realizes how hard it is for me to say those things. I know it's so childish and I guess I'll grow out of it sooner or later but it's terrible. I'm in all my relationships with my eyes half open and my mouth fully closed. I try to ignore all those things that piss me off (although they're not too many) and I do it successfuly. But things that people do and say continuously really end up hurting me and again they don't realize the impact of those things. Every other day I can live with my own vice, being my inability to be blunt, but today it's gotten to me.

       05/08/04    Daniel played some of the parts of my fav RHCP songs. :o) I wasn't feeling good at all so I don't think he really saw how much I loved listening to him play that. But honestly, he made my heart skip, I just thought it was the most beautiful thing in the world. The songs that touch me most on the inside, he played. I don't think I've ever felt like that..maybe a little bit when Eric played Moon River on the piano for me but it just wasn't the same. I told Dan about why my back hurts...*girl related issue*. I don't think he quite understood how serious it is. Partly my fault though, because I tried to make it seem like it wasn't too big of a deal. It's not really though if I take my pills n stuff. (I'm doing it again) LOL. I donno whatever. I'ts not like I'm gonna die or anything. But when it hurts, I wish I was dead cuz it gets so bad sometimes. I haven't told my mom how bad it gets either but...my doctor knows!! lol. Telling him about that was really really hard for me. I don't like telling people things unless they want to know and I don't think he wanted to know something like that. I only told Ramin and Angelo after hours of them bugging me about what was wrong. I kinda don't think Dan ever picked up on it.
