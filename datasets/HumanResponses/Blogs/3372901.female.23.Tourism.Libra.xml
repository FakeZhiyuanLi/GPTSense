      Well disregard that previous post, cause well we pretty much well lost the house. Last night when we went over to the house we made a verbal offer and the owner was happy with it, we talked about things that we need to do within the next few days and she was happy with everything and so were we. And one of her tenants I knew, Fionna, and she kept saying "congratulations" and so did the girl who owns it and her boyfriend. And they phoned today and asked us to come over to their place and talk. She said that the day after we looked at the house some other people did too. And last night before we went to make an offer they had phoned back and said they were interested in it too, but she told them that we were coming over to make an offer, so they showed up today and offered her exactly what she wanted, and they even showed up with a relator. So when she told us I wasn't too surprised, cause I always knew something like this might happen, and knowing my luck it would. So she said that we can match their offer and it would be ours so she told us what they offered and at first Russ and I were like "no way!" But once we got home and calculated it, it wasn't that bad, but by then it was too late and we tried to call her back but she had already told the people we turned it down. So now the only way that we can get the house is if their financing doesn't go through, but I'm sure it will, because once again... it's just my luck that it would turn out that way, not in my favour. Nothing ever really turns out in my favour. It's quite a sad, pathetic world really. So now all I can hope is that these people are poor with bad credit and can't get their act together, but I'm sure they will and it sux that I won't know for a few more weeks now. It just gets under my skin that last night the owner was saying "you'll love this house" "I'm glad your excited" and to where the whole thing stands now is just upsetting to me. The owner said she felt bad, but really she'll get more money out of this, so how bad does she really feel? She's laughing to the bank and we're the joke of it. I'm just so upset and it really sux.   But on a happier note I got my digital camera in today and it's wicked! I love it so much! I'm sure I'll get bored of it soon, but for now it's fun. Well I guess I"ll go sulk and get a little closer to depression. It should be fun.

      Well we made an offer on a house! And so far the girl who owns it has accepted it. So, so far so good, but all we need now is our financing to go through. But it seems like it will and I can't wait! It's hard to even realize that I"m going to own my own house! All I really care about is a yard! I'll have a yard to plant my flowers and veggies! Lots of room for the cats to run around and watch the birds. The girl who owns it is renting some of the rooms out and I know one of the girls and she was saying "I'm so glad I know the people buying the house" And she needs to store stuff somewhere and she'll probably be coming back to Golden for the winter so it would be nice to have some tenants cause we definitely could use the extra money. So we'll see. But we won't be moving in till July 1st so it's still a month and a half away but I should start packing cause knowing me I"ll rush at the end and it'll be disaster.   But on a sader now, about a half an hour ago I let Cisco back in the house and noticed she was limping. Her front paw was bothering her and I yelled for Russ and he noticed it too. He touched her foot and she didn't cry or bite him but you could tell it was bothering her. So Russ said "We can't do anything tonight" So he went to bed and Cisco wanted to go into bed with him so I opened the door and she climbed up on the bed. She didn't stay long and came out and sat with me, but right now she's in the cat house and she seems pretty comfortable. I'll have to take her into the vets tomorrow even though I don't like the vet, but I also have to get Kootenay fixed too cause I don't want kittens running around, even though I really would, but I can't afford them and there are already enough cats in this town and no one ever wants them. So we'll see how Cisco is tomorrow and I have to do stuff in town for the house and Ahh it's so crazy!

      Well last night Russell and I went to view a house just outside of Golden and it's just perfect! It's somewhat a log home and on half an acre with a pond in the back and the inside is beautiful! The wood is a dark brown, almost mahogany, high vaulted ceilings. Theres 4 bedrooms and one of them being a laundry room/ loft bedroom. The bathroom has a rock flooring, and the bath tub is one of those old school ones that stand on their own little gold legs. The basement isn't finished which I kinda like cause we can do what ever to it, compared to the other houses we've seen where I really don't like the basements and I would have to rip the entire thing up, so it's nice to have nothing and start from scratch. Theres a garage that could fit 2 cars in it and then theres a little bit more to the garage too that can be used for storage. Lots of room gardens too. So the place comes with a new washer and dryer a really old lawn mower, stove, fridge, dishwasher. So it's pretty good. I think we're going to make an offer on it tonight and hopefully it'll be good. I can't wait to have a place of my own! And theres also a Golden Retriever breeder 2 doors down... maybe I could get a dog? So I'm pretty excited about that right now. The girl who owns it did a lot of work on that house, new roof, new insulation, redid the bathroom, new counters in the kitchen. She did a good job, but she's moving back to Ontario to be a fire fighter. Us Ontario people are all over this province. Not much else, I've just been thinking about that house and I can't wait to get it!

      Wow do I ever create a mess. But hey who knows it may be quite a good thing in the end. Today I am attempting to make cinnamon buns from scratch and well I'm on my second batch of dough after the first one didn't turn out very well. It just wouldn't rise and I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. But at least I'm learning in the process, what I'm learning... well I have yet to determine that. I would call my mom and ask her for her recipe but I'm not really talking to her right now. I am quite upset with my parents because I'm sick and tired of them dangling money and cars for me to come home and lying about the amount of money I have in my name, but I have heard so many stories about the money that I just had it. I told my mom that I had to give up a really good paying job, even though it was for 2 months, but it was in the field that I wanted to be in and I had to give the job up because I didn't have a car to get there. I was quite upset and my parents don't realize that out here you need a vehicle to get to good paying jobs unless you want to work as a waitress for the rest of your life. Compared to my brother I wasn't as lucky as he was, he got an apprenticeship out of high school, so he didn't have to pay for his education and his job was a high paying job. The most I've ever been paid was probably $9.50! Plus my brother lived at home till he was 26, hell as soon as I could move away to go to school I took that opportunity and haven't really been back since. So now my dad phoned the other day and said that if I find I decent car (my mom wants me to get a Corolla) then they'll send me money for it, but I said no, I want to do it on my own. But since we've been looking at houses I'll probably have to ask them to help us with the downpayment. So either way I need their help... great.     But I'm going to get back at my cinnamon buns. We'll see how they turn out. It should be interesting.

      so this new song by JC from N'Sync, the sex song. Come on... now that song just sux! 'All day long I dream about sex with you'. Like really? This song just is lame and why did they ever let him record it? It'll be a one hit wonder if anyone even likes it and it's sad that a member of N'Sync has come out with that song. I like N'Sync, hell I even like Backstreet Boys, I even went to see a BSB concert once too and I had a good time and my friends have the video tape to prove it, however I do say that I was a whole different person on that video and my body was taken over by a 12 year old girl. I got a little giddy. But hey we were chasing the Backstreet Boys in downtown Toronto to their hotel! Who wouldn't want to do that?! Anyways back to the shitty song, you know I can take a shitty song like that guy who sings in a really high pitch tone and the part of the song goes 'I believe in a thing called love, just listen to the rythm of my heart', you know the really skinny guy with bad teeth and long frizzy hair. Now that guy sux and the song is shitty but there is a part of you that likes the song. But the sex song... no you can't even begin to like a bit. Just sad, just sad

      Well tonight Russ and I had to go up to the ski hill cause Russ didn't realize till 8 tonight that he had forgotten his backpack that had his wallet up at work. So we drove to his co-workers house to get keys into the office. They were already getting ready for bed. Dropped some tomato plants off to another one of his coworkers houses and then up to the ski hill. We saw mama bear and her 2 cubs, their so cute. There were 2 tourist cars slowing down to look at them, but as they went past the bears they still kept going the same speed. So we passed them. The new lodge is looking good, they've got some rock on the walls and so theres a lot more colour then just ply wood. On our way home we stopped in at DQ and got some ice cream, I love DQ, however here in Golden they are somewhat retarded... they always seem to fuck up your order and same goes for McDonalds as well here. I swear they hired the kids who got kicked out of school and go to the alternate school in town. So they gave Russ his hot fudge sundae, however it looked more like a blob then a sundae, they did not do the DQ twist!   So now the madness... We got home and there was a message on the answering maching, but I had to pee so bad, I let Russ get it. So guess who it was?! The girl who owns the house we want and got fuct over with. So she just wanted to let us know what was going on with the house... well she's not even sure. So not much else has happened since we were at the house on friday night. The people haven't really talked to her or finalized anything with the owner so she's kinda wondering whats going on with them. Russ phoned back and her boyfriend answered cause she wasn't home and so they talked a bit. He's a really nice guy and so he just told Russ what was going on and that they aren't sure what these people are doing and they'll keep us posted. We told them we were going up to the cabin tomorrow and won't be back till sunday so hopefully these people will fuck things over and we'll get the house. But its kinda funny that they jumped on the house because we made an offer and now they aren't doing anything really. They still have another week, but me personally, I would much rather get things finalized as fast as I could before the dead line, but thats just me. So I so hope these people will not get their shit together. And then I can have my own house! So keep your fingers crossed!   Oh ya tonight the cats put on such a great show for us. Kootenay was under the covers (she loves being under the covers) and Cisco thought she wanted to play, so she started to pounce on top of her, but then Kootenay didn't like that anymore and poked her head out and thats when the real fighting began. Cisco would go for her throat and Kootenay would push her back with her back feet and paw her in the face... it was great. They kept it up for awhile and moved to the floor. It's so funny to see 2 cats just stare at each other with their tails swaying back and forth and the one breathing through her nose in an angry manner and then all of the sudden one dives for the other one and attacks. Its so much fun with 2 cats. Well I'm going to bed,I've gotta wake up early... a lot earlier then 12 in the afternoon as what I've been doing lately... I know your all jealous hehe.

      Don't you love it when you work out and your body aches and burns. It just makes ya feel good cause you know you worked off that icecream, or chocolate bar you had the day before. Even though I always take my time to actually work out I always feel good in the end, so why do I waste my time contemplating it? Anyways it was a blah day. It drizzled most of the day, couldn't see the mountains. The cats didn't go out much today, Cisco usually cries to go out, but I guess since she's hurtin she just wants to sleep. Tonight Russ and I were on the bed and she was up there with us and I went to scare Kootenay but I guess Cisco got scared too and fell off the bed and landed on her hurt paw. So she started walking around on 3 legs again. Opps. We're going up to the cabin on thursday for the weekend. Can't wait.   Oh ya we watched the movie Miracle tonight. Not a bad movie, but really good if your a hockey buff. Part of the movie was filmed Rossland last year and Russ and I took a drive up there when they were filming and the town looked so cute. Rosslands a cute town to begin with but to see it with lots of people and it all decorated it was cool. We didn't see any stars, but lots of random people everywhere. Our friend was an extra in the film too, but we couldn't see her anywhere.   Well I'm off to bed now. Ta ta.

      Well nothing really eventful went on today. I cleaned the house cause it's messy and it bothers me and it's something to do. I had a nice long conversation with my land lady. We talked about the poor quality, or lack of here in Golden. She said her and her husband enjoyed reading my article in the newspaper and was thankful that someone had the balls to come out and tell the town that the prices of houses are too much and the quality of homes is not what the money is worth. She said she'd ask her husband to keep an eye out for some decent homes. We also talked about this home thats down the road. It's a beautiful place but still not finished and apprently the man who built it, well built it first and then drilled for water... well there was no water, but it didn't bother him too much, he had an outhouse and I'm not sure what he used to shower with. But he sold it to some germans this fall and they drilled for water too and were unable to find any. So now they have to build a sistern to collect water. Hmm wouldn't you drill first before you built? I mean that would be the logical thing to do. But everyone else around here has water so I don't see why they are having such a problem with it.   We're going up to the cabin on thursday, and I'm looking forward to getting out of Golden for a break. But however, the grandparents will be up there, so it won't be too much fun. Russ told his grandparents they didn't have to stay up there for us but no they insisted, but of course they did. So we'll probably collect firewood for them, go fishing, fix the yard up for them, pack the remainder of our things that we've left there and I guess just relax. I was going to take Kootenay into town to the SPCA to get fixed, but I called their office and apprently they aren't an actual shelter... so I can't get her fixed. Shitty, she better not get pregnant! I would like little kittens running around, but not in this town, it's too hard to get rid of kittens. But I can't wait to drive through Kamloops and shop! I shouldn't shop but I'll be working soon. In 14 days I guess. Can't wait!

      Well we had quite the fun filled packed day. Well not really. I felt I was back in school again listening to someone just talk and talk and it goes in one ear and out the other and it takes so much for me to focus and understand the person that seems to be talking another language other then english.   This morning I woke up and drove Russ to work. I came home and had started to get a headache so I laid down for an hour. I got up at 8:30, had a bath with the girls. My cats like to sit on the side of the tub and wait for me to pour them a glass of cold water from the faucet and then they fight over who gets to drink out of it. After that I had a quick breakfast and went to pick up Russ for 10. It was a little chilly up at the hill today, but it was still quite early in the day. we went to the lawyer in town... theres only 2! Sad eh? And he made us wait like almost a half an hour. Russ was pissed. So we finally get to meet with him and he went over the contract we filled out with Julie the other night at her house and apprently it wasnt that great. We went over a few other things and he told us how much he'll cost for his services... $750, wow it must be nice to make that kind of money in such a short amount of time. After that we went over to the house cause we got the inspector to look at the house. Julie wasn't there but her boyfriend Eric was. So we talked with the inspector and he showed us a few things around the house that would be a concern. Pretty much everywhere in Golden, basements do get water in them. Golden is built in a marsh land, which is known as the Columbia Valley and the Columbia Valley is as large as the Everglades in Florida. I even think it's one of the largest marshlands in Canada. It runs all the way down to Cranbrook which is 3 hours away. So everyone in town pretty much has a sump pump. My parents even have one in Kitchener and we live a on a fucking hill! So the house had more water in it then when we first looked at it... and we knew there would be. The Columbia and Kicking Horse Rivers are really high right now so it's expected. However the only concern we have about the basement was that some of the supporting walls around the stair are really rotten and they'd need to be replaced. And another bad thing was that the plumbing from the bathroom needs to be redone. The way the pipe to the septic tank sits, well it looks like there would be stuff sitting in those pipes and that wouldn't be so nice. So most of the work needs to be done in the basement. And like Russ said to Julie's boyfriend, the main floor is all you really need. The heat, and water are fine and thats all you really need right now.   Then we went outside to check on the septic tank. Now I've had to clean portable shitters when I worked with the City a few years ago, and that was pretty nasty. But this I think may have been worse because when Russ and the inspector lifted the lid... well not only did we see shit, but we also saw a condom! Now I don't know where these people went to school but don't people know that condoms aren't supposed to be flushed down the toilet, especially when you have a septic tank!? Bacteria can't eat rubber! Russ and I laughed later on in the day when no one was around. We thought we might bring it up to Julie the owner, but I think she might be a little embarrassed.   After that we went to the bank and tried to get the mortgage finalized, but they still need a few more things before they send it off. Plus we tried to bargin with them for a lower rate, because we showed them that we can get a better rate at another bank and hopefully they'll go for it. We also opened up a joint account.. scary. Even my parents didn't open a joint account until a few years ago. But so far it looks good about our financing so hopefully everything will go ok. We get the inspectors report on monday and if theres something in it that he didn't emphisize them maybe we won't take the house. So we'll see.   It turned out to be a hot day today, which was nice. However I had a headache most of the day and when we got back home I had to lay down cause the heat was making me sick.   Hmm what else? Oh the other day when I called my parents to tell them all the good news about me going back to Guest Services and getting the house, well when my parents answered the phone and I said I had good news my dad asked "oh did you win the lottery?" and I laughed and said "Ya dad I won the lottery and I'm buying you a house!" Russ said today that I should've said "Ya dad I won the lottery and bought you a house that I"m going to live in." Good idea.   Anyways this is long enough and I'm going to bed... till next time.

      Well it was quite the day in Golden. It was so hot and sunny today. I drove Russ to work this morning and on the way down from the hill I saw a doe and a buck and the buck looked big. Maybe he'll make for some good hunting this fall.    So I went out over to Andreas in the afternoon and she's got a pretty nice place. Even though its a basement place it's still got a lot of light. We went out for lunch and gossiped. It was fun to talk to someone like that, it's been awhile. She mentioned that Mel wanted to talk to me about going back to Guest Services and so after I dropped Andrea off at home I went up to the hill to get the employment of verification paper for the bank so that we can get our mortgage and Mel was on the phone so I waited till she got off. I told her that we were buying a house and she was pretty excited and then she asked if I wanted to come back to Guest Services cause Monique who worked there last summer and this past winter was going to work there full time but she got a job at Parks... the job I was going for, but because she's good friends with a girl who works in Parks, she got the job. So Monique just told Mel 2 days ago and so she was quite mad considering we open in 2 weeks. So I said that I would and I was so happy that she asked me to come back. She also lost a part time person to daylodge and so she stole me from retail.. its only fair. So now I'll be making a dollar more then I would've at retail and I'll be working in a place that I love to work at. And another good thing... the manager for Guest Services that was on Maternity leave has now left and the manager filling in for her will be moving to her new position in July. So that means Mel my supervisor will probably be my manager and Andrea will be moved up to supervisor and then that means that someone else will be able to stay on for the fall part time instead of being laid off and I sure hope that'll be me! It would be so great then I'd have work all year round. Keep your fingers crossed. In the past 2 days everything is looking up and bright and I can't believe it. I'm sure it'll all go to hell very shortly, but for the time being its looking good.   We went over to Julie, who owns the house we want, to her place. We filled out the contract for purchase and went over a few things. It seems that they will be leaving or getting rid of a lot of things. They are driving their little volkswagen rabbit back to Ontario with 2 dogs so they won't be fitting much in that car. But since they'll still have half an acre they have this falafel shack that they'll put some stuff in storage on their half. But I'm sure they'll want to leave their plants which I love and probably some furniture. They have this cool chair, I don't know what it's called but it's and old school chair that is like half a circle and oh their so comfortable. I think we might even get a bed out of it too... we'll see though. So I guess I'll start to pack. Can't wait! Ahhh!!!

      Well we got back from the cabin yesterday and it only took about 5 and a half hours. We thought it might take 6. So thursday we got up, packed the truck and went into town to pick up Russ's parcel from my mom. We had put Kootenay in the cage cause we knew that Cisco would be ok out on her own, and Kootenay wouldn't shut up. We laughed and laughed and after we picked up the parcel we were driving past the mill and we could smell, what we thought was a fart, but it was poo. Kootenay had pooed in her cage... thank you so much Kootenay! Russ was quite mad. She then hid somewhere in the truck, she just wanted to cover her head. So drove on. Through Rogers Pass was so beautiful, it was a clear day and the mountains were just amazing. We stopped for lunch in Kamloops at Wendy's. I had a frosty... I love those. It was so hot in Kamloops, the radio said it was 28 and the girls were finiding it really hot. We stopped at Costco and I got the new Dr. Phil cook book and cheapier then what I would get at Chapters so I was pretty happy. We then drove across to Cache Creek and stopped in at the veggie farm and got some beets. They didn't have a whole lot but more then I was expecting. And they didn't have many strawberries and that was sad. And from there we contined to the cabin. It was pretty warm there. When we parked in the driveway I tried to get Kootenay out of the truck but she had crawled under my seat to get away from the heat and was now stuck. Russ was so mad again. So when he did get her out he grabbed her by the back of the neck and carried her in the house like that and threw her on the ground inside the cabin. I've never seen him so mad at her like that before. Cisco was pretty happy to be at the cabin, she stayed outside most of the day and watched the birds and ate the grass. We didn't do a whole lot the rest of the day... I was pretty tired and I had to keep checking on Kootenay cause she kept crying and wasn't sure of where she was and she'd hide a lot and I was afraid that she would pee somewhere where I didn't want her to go. She feel asleep on me that night and it was so hot and I hate Russ's bed at the cabin so I didn't get much sleep.   Friday Russ got up earlier then I did and I heard him let Cisco out and apprently she caught a bird in no time flat. When I got up Russ had made breakfast for me and soon afterwards we went into town with Russ's gram. She had to get some money back for something she paid too much for at a clothing store. So we took her there and I went to get Russ a birthday card and he walked in on me picking it out... great. So afterwards we couldn't find his grandma and we walked around the mall and it isn't big and we went back and still couldn't find her in that store and walked to the grocery store and walked back to the store and finally found her, she was trying stuff on and wanted to buy more things. Great! She kind of has a spending problem. So she said she'd be 5 mins so we waited in the truck for her. Well she was a little more then 5 mins and when she came in the truck she showed us what she bought and she had bought some shorts that were bright yellow, elastic waist band and were old people shorts and she said she paid like $5 for them and said "maybe we should go back and get you some" and in my head all I can think was "ya right I'd rather die!". Russ and I talked about that later and we laughed and he said he would never let me wear those. We went to a few other places and then Russ wanted to go to the pawn shop and well he bought himself a chop saw! And he even talked the guy down. I had bought my manual camera there last year and it's been pretty good.    So when we got back Russ wanted to try his saw out. I went out on the dock and just watched the water and the fishes. Cisco came out with me and she was having a good time and she even walked out on the dock too. She used to hate the dock and now she walks onto it by herself! So Russ's grandpa went out fishing with his friend and Russ and his grandma decided they'd put a ceiling in the mud room without Ed knowing. So Russ got to use his saw and he loved that. I did some gardening for Pat and I would love to plant flowers there but they'd probably just die. So we got the ceiling up and it looked good. And Russ's grandpa came back in for dinner and still didn't notice what Russ had done and it took him awhile too. I read most of that night. My mom had sent a book called Russian Feasts and it was really good I couldn't put it down. It's about Russians and their culture, what kinds of food they celebrate with and what occasions are really special for them and at what time of year they do things. It's quite like Ukranian traditions so thats why my mom sent it to me. That night I slept in Wes's bed across the room cause I couldn't stand to sleep in the slanting bed. Also that night there was a mosquito in the room and I couldn't fall asleep cause it kept buzzing in my ear. Plus it started to rain off and on that night too. I watched the sun rise though. Russ let me sleep in a bit and he made breakfast and then went off for a drive to find some birch wood. When he got back we went to the dump and the corner store and when we got back I was so tired I had a nap with the girls. I woke up to hearing more rain. Russ was making his grandma some shelves to put in the mud room so he was doing that for most of the day. I started to pack some things that we had around the cabin that had been there since last year and the girls were still sleeping and this time they were sleeping with their heads together... it was so damn cute.    We went out for dinner for Russ's bday, but his grandparents forgot one major thing... it was the night of the hockey game. We went to the pub that they always go to and there was no way we were going to get in there within a half an hour. So we drove into 100 Mile House and were looking for a place to eat. We drove to so many places. We went to this restaurant and they said they were totally booked... great! So we said that we'd go to the ABC and it had moved and I noticed it moved but no, Russ's grandparents thought it was at another place. Russ and I were getting so frustrated and mad we couldn't take it anymore so we did find the ABC restaurant and we walked in and they showed us to a table and Russ's grandpa asked if he could be seated near the tv to watch the game and I was like "oh fuck!" and so they brought us down to the pub and it was dingy and they brought us to a table and the chair I got had crumbs on it and so we sat down and I wasn't happy at all and Russ could tell. But as dinner went on things got better. Well kinda... when Russ got his beer that he ordered he said that it wasnt cold enough and it wasn't that warm and then when we got our bill they said that their debit and credit card machines weren't working so they needed cash. Uhh write the credit card number down! They weren't that bright there.    The next morning it was just pouring. And it didn't stop. So we loaded Russ's dresser up in the shed and then drove the truck down under the deck so he could pack the truck properly. I don't know why he didn't put the canopy on the truck before we left. It took awhile for him to pack the truck. We finally got it all, or what we thought and took off. We stopped in Kamloops again for lunch and went to Future Shop and Shoppers Drug Mart and then on home.    It took us awhile to unpack when we got home. And we just kinda left everything there. We went into town to get a few things and we dropped by the bank and saw Anna, whom we knew from school last year, and Carly who we knew from Manning Park last year and they asked if we were engaged and we both laughed and I asked "oh you must've read the paper". Now I've had a few people ask us if we're engaged but if I wrote the article any different then it would sound imature.    So today I unpacked pretty much everything and re-arranged things. I made beet leaf buns... they were ok but I should've done things differently, oh well next time.    So now onto something that I swear is going to make me insane! So the girl who owns that house that we wanted... well she phoned tonight and said that the other people that just had to have the house their financing didn't go through and so if we want the house we can have it. So I guess we're getting the house! Provided our financing goes through too. So I know I should be more excited but give me awhile and I will be. Oh ya and another good thing is that I was talking with Andrea who works at guest services with me and she was saying that our Supervisor Mel wanted to talk to me cause know they had someone else leave so they need another person to work there and I had said I was working at the retail store but that was only because they weren't hiring in guest services so I went to retail but now it looks like I might be going back to Guest Services and I hope soo too cause I'd rather work there plus I'd make 50 cents more, it's not much but at least it's better. SO it looks like things are starting to work out afterall. Yeah!

      Right now I'm watching Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie on their new show and it's so funny. They were babysitting some little girl and the mother gave them a list of rules and they totally broke them all and now they decided to play hide and seek with the little girl and lost her and the parents just pulled up to pick her up. I can't believe how stupid they are. And these girls have been begging for money to get gas and food. And Paris and Nicole were working at this ranch in Florida and were riding horses and Paris decided she wanted to go faster on the horse and the horse started to buck her off and she fell off and she says the horse stomped on her but I think it tapped her and she was flown to the hospital... a little exaggerated but she's rich.   With each day we get closer and closer to getting the house. The other day when we talked to the bank lady, by the way who seems to be an airhead, she said that we were pretty much approved we just need to agree on a rate. They want to offer us 5.8% however we're trying to bargin them down to 5.4%. So we have an appointment on friday but Russ can't make it cause he's working so I'm hoping they don't take advantage of me cause I always feel that people try to take advantage of other people when they don't have someone with them that knows about certain things. Also the bank lady told me the other day that she needs to get our parents to sign a letter saying that the money that they've given us is a gift and we don't have to pay back. Well what the fuck for? My money is from my grandma when she died and my parents held it for me and the money Russ's parents are giving us was supposed to be for our wedding but since we're buying a house first they decided to give it to us instead of saving it for our wedding... if we ever have one. Just kidding of course I'm getting married, probably not for awhile though. Anyways I'm bored now so I'm going.

      Well we went to see Shrek 2 tonight and it was just as good as the first one. The cat known as Puss'n Boots is really cute and funny. I don't want to give it away but my favorite part was when he got caught with cat nip. But the movie was overall really good. My favorite part in the first movie was the ginger bread man when he was being tortured... that was the best... "Not my gum drop buttons!" However I do hate the movie theatre here in Golden. It's so old school. It's even worse then the movie theatre I used to work at when I was in high school and that was shitty, considering it was $5 on tuesday nights and everywhere else were charging like over $10. I'm used to the stadium seating with surround sound and nice cushy seating. Tonight there was annoying persone behind me that would chew with their mouth open, kick the back of my chair, put his feet on the back of my chair, slurp on his drink that had no pop left, but still couldn't get that through his mind like 10 times that he tried and would shake his popcorn bag for no apparent reason. I really do hate people some times. It makes me think of people who come up to the hill and would lean over the counter and breath in my face and just smelled like alcohol or b.o. or something else and I would just want to walk away. I remember there was a man who had just had a smoke and for some reason he decided to take a deep breath in and blow it in my face. It took me a second to get back to what I was doing because I had to turn my head and hold my breath. Oh and theres that guy that decided to take one of the pens on the counter that was attached to a string and decided to pick his teeth with the ball point end and I just watched him and said to him "you can have that pen now" and he said "oh the one I was picking my teeth with?" and I said "ya you can take it cause I don't want it anymore" He didn't take it, but I couldn't believe someone would do that... right infront of me while I'm getting their lift ticket! I really can't take people sometimes... makes you wonder. Oh ya and another thing. No one in this town knows how to say excuse me! They walk right through and don't say a word. It's mostly the younger people that don't know how to say that so obviously they have no respect for elders.. how nice. I know I sound so old! Anyways I'm going to bed now.

      Well at the moment right now my friend Stacey is already married or is currently in the ceremony getting married and I'm not there. It's a little sad. So far being out here I've missed 2 weddings and I'm sure I'll miss more, because everyone seems to want their weddings in the summer... well summer is the busy time in the industry that I'm in. It sux.  But besides that, it's saturday... my weekend and I"m bored. This morning when Russ was going to work I had a sore throat and noticed there was something in my throat so I got Russ to look at it and theres like a hangy ball thing... not my tonsils and it's kinda annoying and it just popped out of no where. And I tried to give my mom a call and she's no where to be found. Thanks mom for telling me you were going away for the weekend. So I took a benedryl thinking it might do something... well it did, it made me sleepy! And it rained this morning... which is good cause we needed it, but now its wet outside so I can't really ride my bike and I could pack but I'm lazy.   Well I think Kootenay might be pregnant... which isn't good. She snuck out on tuesday night and spent the night outside and I was awoken by cats fighting but I didn't think anything of it. Then when Russ was going to work he asked where Kootenay was so I went outside looking for her. I kept calling for her and I could hear her, but I couldn't find her. She was under the steps of a deck and there was a big black cat behind her that wouldn't leave her alone and she was so afraid. So I took her in and later that day that same cat was outside of our bathroom window meowing/crying, so I think it might be a tom cat. Russ wasn't impressed, but he left the window open that she jumps out of. So she stuck by me for the whole day never leaving my side and she's been like that since too, which is nice but kinda annoying some times. That same cat was back last night crying outside... great.   It's been stinking hot here in Golden. One day it got up to almost 40 and we have a fire ban in place right now. It's a lot earlier then last year. The snow is melting quite fast from the mountain tops and the Kicking Horse River is quite high. I'm sure the basement in our house has water in it. But by the time we move in it'll probably be gone cause I don't see the Kicking Horse River being high for much longer now.  I know that theres not much snow in the bowls on the ski hill anymore, they're pretty much have cut in half the size now. It's so freakin hot in the daylodge where I work and theres no air conditioning. Sometimes its cooler outside then it is inside. All week long we've had calls about when we're opening and if we could open any earlier... uhh no sorry. It's quite funny some of the things people ask and I wonder that their IQ is.   The other night we went over to the house we're buying to get our house inspection that we lent to them and we were asking them where they were going to stay after they move out of the house and they said that they have a place on the 15th, but they move our on the 10th so they'll have a few days that their not sure what their going to do and then they menitoned that they might just camp out on the lawn next door cause they're still keeping the property next to us. She had an acre and just split it up and so we get the one half and their keeping the other half if they ever decide to move back. So they want to camp out on the lawn... well don't make me feel bad at all! Trish has told me "not to let them stay at he house of use anything at the house" Like right now we're going to let them keep some of their things in the garage until the end of july cause they need to move things into storage somewhere. So I think we're being more then generous. And when we were there the other day they mentioned that they were going to have a garage sale today and that we should come by and check it out. I almost wanted to say "so you can make more money off of us?!" Ya right!   And apprently Russ's grandparents are coming to visit the day after we move in. Great. They wanted to come down the day we were moving and Russ said no cause he knew his grandma would put things away that I didn't want her to put away and we'd never be able to find it. So now I have to rush to get things organized so that she doesn't put things away. Great. I'd much rather have them come down the weekend after, but fishing season starts so Russ's grandpa has to be around for when they call to tell him it's open. Russ's grandma reminds me of my grandma... I can only take so much and then she gets really annoying. When we were at the cabin like a month or a few weeks ago I was going to scream at both is grandparents cause they were being so stuborn and annoying. So we'll have to see how I hold up when we move and they come to visit.   Not much else I guess.

      Well I'm totally out of things right now. So to give a short up date. Last friday we went into the bank and finalized everything so our financing is all figured out and the house is ours and I guess all we have to do is sign with the lawyer when the bank gets their shit together. And speaking of getting their shit together, our fucking lawyer is a fucking twit. Yes I called him a twit and I should really call him a tit too. As soon as we got the other signature for the contract he said he would fax the contract over to the bank which is right across the fucking street. Well 5 days later he didn't so we walked over to the lawyer and asked him where it was. He had our file in a bunch of other ones and was onto of the filing cabinet... hmm ya it seems its organized. Plus they have like 3 secretaries and obviously they don't do their job. So he gave us a photo copy and we had to take the contract over ourselves... what a fucking lazy ass. But it's not like we have much choice cause thats the only lawyers office in town. Ya it's sad. So that night we went out to a place called the Mad Trappers to have halibut... I love the fish there.   Saturday Russ got up early to take his truck to get an oil change and I was going to go with him but I was too tired cause the night before I had a migraine... I've been getting them a lot lately for some reason. So he got home and woke me up to go garage selling.. I guess what you would call it. Most of them were pretty sad and there were a lot of toys, but I got 2 boxes of canning jars so this summer I'll can some peaches, beets and maybe some jam. I'm becoming so much like my mom it's scary! So on our way home we stopped at a few more garage sales and the old people were so nice. This one house we went to the lady had such beautiful gardens. She had, I swear, every colour of columbine known to man and their so beautiful. She also had a bunch of different colour of iris's, but I don't really like iris's. We bought an atena and most of you probably wouldn't know what that was cause everyone is so used to satelite now, but we don't have enough money for satelite so we get bit huge bunny ears on top of our house. Well they really aren't bunny ears but it's tall and on our roof. And that only cost $5!  We got home and started to pack to go camping that night. I thought I had packed pretty good, remembering the soap, dish rag,  and even tp! So we got the truck packed and headed out towards Mummery Glacier, it's about 20 mins or so from our house. We got to the site and no one was there thank god! As you pull up to the site you look out onto the Blaeberry river and it's just a huge valley. It's so beautiful there. We unpacked and set up camp, however that day there wasn't a cloud in the sky and it was super hot out and so we didn't have a whole lot of shade. We were there around 1 or so and sat outside most of the day. Come 4 we got really tired and drained and we moved out tent out of the sun and into some shade and had a nap for 2 hours even though it was still really hot. We got up and made dinner, beer flavoured chicken and butter and herb sidekick... oh ya we dine in style. So after dinner we had a fire, roasted a few marshmallows but I can't eat as many as I used to when I was a kid, now I can only eat like 4 and then I feel sick. We went to bed at like 10 and it was still quite bright out and so I decided that I would sing to Russell, song that are way out of date like New kids and blind melon and all he wanted to do was sleep. It was still bright in the tent at 12! I froze my ass off that night and I should've brought an extra blanket, but I'm a retard. So I didn't sleep much that night and kept waking up frequently. Plus we were right beside the river and all I could hear was the water and I was worried that there was an animal outside and I wouldn't be able to hear it.   So we woke up at 6 and Russ got a fire going and we I burned my pj pants and I got mad so I told him to pack up and we were gone by 6:30. We got home and I went straight to bed with the cats... I missed them. Then we went to see the wolf santuary down the road cause they had an open house and I felt bad for the animals. Then we ran into town to get a few things and when we got home, Russ went to bed and I cleaned the house.   Monday was orientation, but I had to go up with Russ at 7 and I read in the truck and then went to work at 9. IT was a pretty boring morning, lots of high people talking about the hill and informing us of new things. There weren't many employees there but theres a lot less people working there for the summer then there is in the winter.   Didn't really do much for the rest of the day, gossiped most of the day I guess. I was done around the same time Russ was and we went into town to buy a big fan. It's been over 30 for the past few days and since we live on the 3rd floor it's just insane in here.   Today was a little boring. I waited from 7 till 9:30 reading in the truck and then went to work. it was really boring at work. There wasn't much to do but some paper work and a few passes and answer phones... oOooO fun. I watched Russ work out in the sun for a bit and that was a good highlight but other then that there wasn't anything. But the man who called and said that he was excited and disappointed. Excited that he was coming to Golden, but disappointed that in september when he would be here we would be closed and he said "is there any chance of staying open for us" I wanted to laugh, but I didn't. So no Mr. we won't stay open just for you!  And now I'm going to bed cause Russ took me on a bike ride tonight that nearly killed me!

      Well work has been quite busy this week and I hate the grizzly bear tours at the ski hill. It has been nothing but hell for us. It's amazing to see how a new ski resort is so poorly managed. You advertise for this bear tour, however it's so screwed up that people get delayed and have to wait awhile because either there isn't enough room on the shuttle or the driver is just behind. It's really stupid. They need 2 shuttles and a shuttle needs to run every 15 mins instead of every half an hour. And people are getting mad at us... like it's my fault that this is all going wrong! But I feed off of peoples anger and pissy ness. But the best thing that happened this week was I got a call from the top of the gondola and they wanted to tell me that I had to catch some people coming down on the gondola cause they were dine and dashers. I had to ask again and sure enough there were people who didn't pay at the restaurant and I had to get the money from them. So it turns out that they had a few glasses of wine and it got to them a little and they realized that they didn't pay when they got in the gondola and they had their credit card ready. I thought for a minute... as if you can dine and dash on top of the mountain and think you can get away with it when you have to take a gondola down. But other then that, some old thing at the hill. I've been really tired coming home that I really don't want to do anything, but so far I've been washing the dishes every night and even made cookies and did laundry so I haven't been too lazy. Tomorrow should be a hellish day. I'm working 12 till 10... ooOoo fun. So far this week I've worked over time every day but wednesday. Guest services needs to hire another person cause today was the first day all week that I got to have a lunch and actually sit down. But their too cheap to do that.    Well next week we move and we still haven't packed much. Russ hasn't packed a thing yet but he has thursday and friday off before we move on saturday so he'll be able to do most of the stuff cause I really don't want to do it. I'm so lazy.    Kootenay's boyfriend has been around a lot and he's got quite the large balls on him. He keeps coming around and meowing really loudly and it's annoying. Cisco tried to fight him but he ran away, it was funny.    Oh ya and sunday, Russ got off early so since I had spilled bleach on my capri pants on saturday he asked if I wanted to go to Banff and get some new ones. So we drove there. Wasn't much traffic and it was kinda a blah day. I looked at the Bay, but the sizes there didn't fit right and made me feel like a fat ass. Then we went to the Gap and oh I love that store. I could fit into a 10!At the bay it was more like 14! So I got some new pants and I got a new shirt for $20... regular $40.. good deal! I would've liked to have bought more but since I just got back to work and we've bought a house I didn't think it was a good idea. Russ got a cowboy shirt and we had lunch where I had an elk and Russ had a cariboo burger. I love meat! Especially when its gamey cause I know that people don't like the idea of it and I love it when they think it's gross. On our way home we took the Bowvalley parkway and just as we got on and turned the corner there was this huge bull elk! So we got some shots of it and he was beside the road eatting and there were so many people taking pictures of him and he didnt' care. There were even those stupide tourists that get too close to the animal and I love those people cause one day when they do get attacked then maybe they'll learn their lesson, until then it's great to laugh at them.   Well I'm tired so I'm going to bed now.

      You know computers make me really mad some times. When you think they'll work... they don't. Fucking fuck fuck. Well since I don't have to repeat what I wrote yesterday... which is great... I'll tell you about my day today. Well it wasn't as bad as friday, but pretty close. So to make things short and sweet... I hate bear tours... people are assholes. But on a good note I met lots of Kitchener/Waterloo people today. I wanted them to put me in their suitcase and take me home. I do miss Tig and Molly even Mom and Dad and I guess Kev and Denise but I also miss Mavi boy. It's kinda sad that I miss the animals more then the people.   So our bear tours were fucked again today. We had ordered another shuttle bus from the taxi company in town and we had asked them to be there for a certain time. Well they weren't and the lady that dispatched the guy out had forgotten... thanks bitch. Now because of this careless human being, Guest Services got reamed out by a fat lazy ass lady who made her kid cry cause she was freaking out and made her husband so embarrassed that he had to walk away that she ended up looking like an idiot to us and everyone else, but also a bitch. So we ended up giving her some money back but she still went on the bear tour and got a really good deal and we look like the retards because someone else had fuct up. Oh what a wonderful world.   Uhh not much else to say so I'm going to bed now

      I'm watching the Simpsons right now and they are just so hilarious. The best part of this episode is where Homer shoots Flanders out of a canon and Flanders says as he's flying through the air, " I can see my house!". I don't know why but I laugh and laugh at that part. I remember being around the age of 8 or 9 and watching them at the cottage in South Hampton with my cousins and it was so much fun. I miss those days being a kid. I was talking with my cousin Natalie tonight and when we were younger we used to be so close and it's unfortuante that we've drifted apart. I know we're not alike anymore but her sister Angie I don't think are the same either but they get along great. It's a little weird how much Angie is like me when I was her age, but she's stuck with the lifestyle that I wanted and she suits it better then me.  So on friday I was ready to quit and have a nervous break down. I went with Russell in the morning cause he worked at 7 and I didn't start work till 12, so I had a nap in the truck for awhile and then went to see Boo, the grizzly at 10:30. He was playing in his pool and he was so darn cute splashing around. He picked up a stick and put it in his mouth and was throwing it around while he was in the pool, he is just so darn cute I would love to hug him but he'd probably rip my face off.   So it was a busy day and there was 3 of us on and Eric the retail guy was no where to be found. He was up at the Eagle Eye restaurant supposively doing work but Mike our shipper and receiver was sayin that he was chatting with everyone up there and not doing work. So when I had to go over to retail and someone had asked where this certain size was I didn't know and it looks bad when the person that works at the resort doesn't know whats going on or what to do. So I was freaking out and Mel was helping me too, but she was kinda freaking out too. So I went downstairs to where Eric keeps some of his sizes and I tore the place up. Fuck him for leaving us the store and theres no way that I'm going to put things back nicely after him leaving us alone! Right now he's probably loving this cause he's saving on labour cause he's so fucking lazy to hire someone! So later in the day Brenda left the cafeteria for us to look after and that was fine, but this huge group of English people wanted tea and ice cream so we were running around trying to help them and Justin the resort manager saw how we were panicking but he didn't do much to help out. And he still hasn't done anything to help out. He was the one who sent Eric up to the Eagle Eye and said that we would look after the retail store. He's such a fucking dick. At one point we had such a huge line of people and some of them were getting really pissed, but when they get up to the front of the line they start asking us really stupid questions and they don't stop asking questions. Like you just stood in line for a long time and I could see that you were getting really mad about how long you were standing in line for, but yet you want others to feel the same way and you don't want to help speed up the process. There were a few that did, but fuck some of the questions they ask. Like really were you born on another planet?  So that night I was there to look after guest services... like I should, and the cafeteria and the retail store! Just before 9 there was a storm that blew in and the gondola went on standby so then Eric couldn't come down to do his cash out and asked me to do it. I wasn't happy. So I did my cashout first and it was $500 over and I phoned Andrea up and she said to leave it for her to figure out the next day. Then I went over to retail and started his, but I couldn't find his cashout bag, float bag, any papers and so I phoned up to see if I could talk to him and he was eatting dinner and I said to the guy who answered the phone and said "are you kidding me?" I thought he was doing work!?I was so mad at that point and phoned Andrea again and told what was going on and she said just put his stuff in a bag in the safe and she'd deal with it tommorrow. So I closed it up and went down to the safe. I opened the first door and thought that the combo looked funny like it had been locked and so I tried to open my combo and sure enough the other combo was locked so I phoned Andrea again and she said just hide the money and so I did. That was just the tip of the ice berg and I had had enough and so I finally go out of there by 10:30.  I went in on saturday to teach Patricia the combo for the safe and asked if Andrea had figured out my cashout and what had happend was that Mel had sold a jacket in retail but put the money on my till at guest services and she did some other stuff too on my till so it just messed me up so much but they were able to figure it out. Thank god. And then we talked about Eric and how he's not allowed to leave unless theres 3 of us and so that means that on friday, saturday and sunday between 12 and 4 he can leave but other then that he has to be at the store. Or else we'll close it and he'll lose out on sales. He talked to me for a bit and didn't even say sorry that he didn't get to make it down but all he said was that he really appreciated my help... ya right buddy fuck you! I really don't like him and I'm glad that I'm not working for him. Cause I'm sure I'd freak out cause when he talks he just keeps going and going and never shuts up!   Anywho... I was reading someones blog site tonight and it makes me a little jealous of someone. I don't really want to mention who but they have a new girlfriend now and well from what I've seen their not that attractive but they seem very intelligent. Compared to me, their IQ is probably double of what mine is but I know I'm prettier and far more adventurous. But I know if the person saw this he would probably beg to differ. But he and I have a past and like we've said to each other there will always be something between us that we can't explain, we will always like each other in that sort of way, and hell if we ever get divorced or never married then we'll be together. I know I have a great guy but knowing that another girl is with a guy that I know still likes me I just don't like that. I like it when everyone loves me and wants me and I'm sure every one loves that and I know you can't always have that, but I still like it.   Now it brings me to another point... Dreams about old boyfriends. Now lately I've been having dreams about my ex boyfriend Dan whom I haven't seen in like 3 years. In the dreams its like we're back together again and that same feeling is there. I know he's not the same person anymore but in my dreams he is. Its like we were never apart. I can still close my eyes and remember every thing. I used to look at him and well I guess I would say I would map out his face and I remember every dimple and I even remember how bad his eye brows were. I used to think we'd get married and we talked about it and now I'm glad we aren't together because I know he'd be an alcoholic like his father even though he didn't want to be like his dad at all, but the boy parties way too much. He can't go out and not have a beer. Russ can go out to the bar and not have a beer, he'll usually have a coke. Me I'll have one beer but I usually always have one drink, but I rarely drink. The last drink I had was probably a month ago. In ways Dan and I were so much alike and in other ways we were so different. I was a mother to him and at times he needed it and at times he hated it and I know he was embarrassed or mad but didn't want to say anything, but when he got drunk he got stupid. In ways I wish I could go back in time and relive my life cause I had so much fun and I loved the feelings that I felt with I was with Dan and even with Dave my old room mate whom I did date for a bit but I hurt him and then he ended up hurting me in the end. I'm afraid if I ever see Dave again the same feelings would come back because he is quite attractive. I know I could've married him... but would be happy? that's a hard one to answer. If I ever saw Dan now... well I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be attracted to him. He's very tall and lanky and he wasn' the most attractive guys but there was always something about him that I liked. Well its probably because our friends Jeff turned me down and our friend Brad wasn't making any moves so I figured Dan would be the best choice. Well he was for awhile.. well for college anyways. Lots of good memories and very few regrets. Anyways I'm going to bed. Hopefully this week isnt so crazy and hopefully Eric has hired someone.

      Theres so much to do to this house it's crazy... we need to win the lottery. We put in a garden but it's a little ghetto garden... but it'll do for now. I got a mosquito bite on my forehead tonight either when I was watering my pathetic garden or looking for my dumbass cat Kootenay. I'm looking forward to the weekend though. Saturday we're going up to the ski hill to go for a big hike. Theres a mountain on the other side of Super Bowl that I want to climb to the top off. I figure it'll take maybe an hour and a half to get to the summit and then return will hopefully be 3 hours or 4 in total. But knowing me I've totally underestimated my time and it will take longer then I've projected. Theres another mountain I want to climb that has this weird tower on it. I think it's for a helicopter in the winter becasue I know I've seen some heliski tracks on that mountain they call "Baldy" but this ones is a little harder to get to, theres a small range of sharp ridges that I would have to traverse under and it looks too rocky and I figure it would be easier to climb the mountain from the bottom of it up... I'll do that hike one day. Not much else, I'm tired and need to go to bed. Hopefully I'll dream again about that huge sparkly rock I had on in my dream... man did it sparkle! But the bad things were that it wasn't a canadian diamond and it wasn't my baba's ring either, so hopefully that dream won't come entirely true, but alittle bit I hope will.

      Well yes I'm bad. I haven't written in awhile, but with the move I've been so busy and tired. The move last weekend took so much out of me. We woke up saturday morning and started to pack things up and loaded the truck with one load and went into town to the market and as we pulled up to the parking lot, Russ asked "do you have any money?" I said no cause usually he always has the money and I tend to rely on him to&nbsp; pay for things. Such a nice change from paying everything with my college boyfriend to having this college boyfriend pay for everything. Anyways so we came back with money and I didn't get anything cause the guy from Invemere didn't have any more peas so fuck that idea. We went to the house and Julie and Eric weren't there so we wondered if the house was even open and it sure was. They had left a bottle of wine on the kitchen counter with a sign that says "best wishes" and the keys around the bottle, it was cute. She also had a bottle of wild flowers there too. So we looked around the house and she cleaned it pretty good... or so what I thought. And as we were standing in the front room Russ said to me "Come here!" And I asked why and he said he wanted to pick me up and I said "no! you want to carry me over the threshold!" and he laughed and said "ya" But I wouldn't let him, we aren't married and I was afraid someone might see.  &nbsp; &nbsp; So we kept going back and forth from the apartment to the house taking loads. We have so much crap and it's little stuff that's crap. I can't believe how much stuff we have. We drove out to Golden in the truck with one load and now we have all this stuff. I stayed in the apartment for most of the afternoon to clean cause I wanted to clean really well cause Val our landlord was so good to us so I didn't want to make it messy for her. Then Russ got some help from&nbsp;one of the&nbsp;guys at work. I stayed at the new house and started to put things away and then Russ brought more work guys by and they all smelled like booze!Nice! So they went to get the rest of the furniture and they brought Sisco but not Kootenay, they couldn't catch her. So Sisco checked out the house and they guys had some more beer and burgers. After they left we went to get Kootenay and she did not like the car ride there. She's such a cry baby! Now at the house she's afraid of the hallway for some reason. She moves really slow throughout the house and does not like the hallway and wouldn't walk by it for some reason. Cisco is lovin it here though. She roams all over the house and she loves the backyard. She's been chasing the grasshoppers all over the yard and eatting the grass.  &nbsp; &nbsp;Russ's grandparents came last sunday to visit with his little brother Jordy. They brought some stuff from ikea for me, but it really was a rush and trying to get things organized while they were here and I know that his grandma wanted to put things away, but was holding back. &nbsp; I worked on monday and Russ was off and went around town with his grandparents. We went out for dinner at the Golden Grizzly that night and I ate a huge calzone all to myself and the waiter was quite impressed. The next day they drove me to work and left.  &nbsp; All this week, I get home and don't want to do anything. Russ has put some teleposts in in the basement and cut the grass and I just cook and clean basically. &nbsp; Yesterday I went for a bike ride into town to the market but there wasn't anything. I came home a new way and had to cross hospital creek and got a soaker but it was so hot out I didn't care. I came home and did some gardening but the sun was so draining. Russ was home early and we went out to find some dirt, but couldn't. And not much else I guess.  &nbsp; Today I'm supposed to be doing more gardening but I will eventually.
