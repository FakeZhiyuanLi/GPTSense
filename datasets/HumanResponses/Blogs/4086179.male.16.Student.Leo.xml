      Well I have decided that I shall post jokes on my blog, because i get so many of them and that they usually quite good. So I'll post the ones I like (whether you think that's good or bad), and you tell me what you think.  HOLE IN ONE A certain preacher awoke to perfect golfing weather one Sunday morning.It had been either cold, raining, or too windy for a couple of months and, as he thought it over, the temptation was just too great.  He called up one of his deacons and told him, "You all are going to have to cover for me today.I have to go out of town on urgent business."He felt a little bit guilty as he drove to another town, but the birds were singing, the sun was shining, the sky was bright blue, there was no wind at all, and the temperature was just perfect, so he found ways to justify his absence "just this once."As he stepped up to the first tee, St.  Peter said to the Lord, "Look.Isn't that one of your men on that golf course?  And on a Sunday?"The Lord said, "Don't worry, I'll take care of him."The preacher hit a perfect drive, in fact the best he'd ever hit in his life.  It soared about 250 yards, bounced twice, hit the green, and rolled right into the cup!  St.  Peter looked at the Lord, but he didn't say anything.The preacher was ecstatic as he quickly teed up for the second hole, where his shot was just as good.  He'd made another hole in one -- the second one in his life!At that St.  Peter turned to the Lord, "I thought you said you would take care of him," he demanded."I did," answered the Lord.  "Who's he going to tell?"

      OH MAN!!! lets just say cafe church was interesting. actually lets go into some detail of what happened. first. cafe churhc was a blast!!! heaps of fun. Tom's talk was great, funny, very interesting and very cleverly raised some issues about God and what he has done for us. good stuff tom. but of course he was led by God at cafe church to say what he said. God is good.  second. all of you are soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo gullable. hehehe, well it cost me $5 but it was worth it. even if it was just to see the look on Nats face the 5 times that i had to tell her to get it through her head that me and gemma were never actually going out. fun fun fun. even you anika, yeah you might be thinking that your not gullable, but for you to work it out, pete hayes had to tell you, and he was in on the whole thing.... k.  LET IT RAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MAN THIS HURT! i never thought that they would initiate me to begin with. but when i think about it, and how it happened, i am not really that surprised. like i mentioned in a previous blog, i shuved a cracker down Jamie's pants, so he gave me a right ol' slap. deserved it, hehehe, well at least i can admit it. the only problem with all of this though, is that scott then followed up with one that brought the whole house down. he was right next to me and he just cracked me. this was so bad, i almost bloody well PASSED OUT!!! but scott got what was coming to him. the guys said that i now got a free shot, but i didnt want to take it. dave lovel and jamie pinned scott. the really interesting hting that jamie did though was that he grabbed scott by the knee and made him spread his legs. but since i didnt want to take the free shot, jeremy did it for me...  from behind... uppercut with the arm. hit him so hard that scott rose with the shot. ouch.  well this is the intersting story behind cafe church... cu all soon. bye. oh and beth... i that pinch i gave you... you had it coming. the only reason i did it was because gemma didnt.

      A Mafia Godfather finds out that his bookkeeper has screwed him for ten million bucks. The bookkeeper is deaf. It was considered an occupational benefit and the reason he got the job in the first place.                      It was assumed that since a deaf bookkeeper would not be able to hear anything he'd never have to testify in court. When the Godfather goes to shake down the bookkeeper about his missing $10 million bucks, he brings along his attorney, who knows sign language.                     The Godfather asks the bookkeeper:            "Where is the 10 million bucks you embezzled from me?"                     The attorney, using sign language, asks the bookkeeper where the 10 million dollars is hidden.                      The bookkeeper signs back:             "I don't know what you're talking about."   The attorney tells the Godfather: "He says he doesn't know what you're talking about."   That's when the Godfather pulls out a 9 mm pistol, puts it to the bookkeeper's temple, cocks it, and says: "Ask him again!" The attorney signs to the underling: "He'll kill you for sure if you don't tell him!" The bookkeeper signs back: "OK! You win! The money is in a brown briefcase, buried behind the shed in my cousin Endo's backyard in Queens!" The Godfather asks the attorney: "Well, what's he say?"  The attorney replies: "He says you don't have the balls to pull the trigger."

      Well this was an interesting experience. beth and hannah were really good. i was really impressed. then there was sum ppl dancing along to that song on shrek, and then 1 of the mice fell over, completly stacking it. hit the ground so hard. it was great. but she got bac up and she was ok. she kept dancing. it was pretty good. then there was the interval... got to meet sum of gemma, beths, and mels friends.  that was interesting. mind you i dont really know who was more scared of the other. me scared of them, or them scared of me... mind you the only ones that didnt look worried, were gemma, beth and mel, they know i am like that all of the time. hehehe. luke plees comment. the best bit about beths and hannah's dance was the fist shaky thing with the side step. THAT WAS THE  BEST cos  they showed me at the winter sleepout, and i can do it too. there were lots of singers and they were all good too, and there were lots of other good acts too. but then there was the 2 chicks at the end of the whole thing. OH MY GOSH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THESE GIRLS WERE... OH MY GOSH. like unless you were there you got no idea how good these girls are... gees. gift from god, its all there is to it. they are in year nine and one of the girls is 2 levels of professional. well all inall it was a good night.

      Joy is good. GOD is good. man this is so exciting. i am so at peace with myself, there is just two things in my life at the moment that satan is just trying so hard to attack. trying to bring me down. but bcos of joy, i am ok with it. well not ok with it but i dont really care. the feeling that i constantly have inside of me, is just excitment. so excited about who god is and what he is about. the fact that god is with me every step of the way. i am excited about who he is. i am rejoicing in God. things are tough, but bcos of joy i get through it with ease. blessed are those that are persecuted. i got that with me, so i know that despite what i cop God is there with me the entire time, watching me.

      I am going to Japan soon, like at the end of the month, or not, im not sure. but in september till october. thats right 2 weeks and it ends on the 3rd of october. you do the math, cos i cant be bothered.  i have a book i have to read for english. to kill a mockingbird.  got i good saying from that book that i really like. its 'buying cotton'. its a polite term for doing nothing. hehehe. how kool. so i am reading that as much as i can.  i dont like english, i really dont like english... mind you the book is good.  i found sumthing that i am really good at. modern history. i really like it too. just got bac a test about edward gough whitlam. 27/30. thats pretty impressive. im realy happy with that. cos i really enjoyed that topic and its good tol know that i did well in it too.  science project... going well. mind you i still have to write it all up. i am 1 week into it and i still havent written anything up yet about it... how lazy! mind you it is going well.  GOD IS GOOD!!! man god is doing so much in my life, and not just me specifically. so much happening around me that i am taking in. other ppls lives... its all very exciting.  i feel ova the last while god has really built me up as a person. not much happended spiritually for a long while. but ova that space of time god was making me a much better person. so much more patient, and tolorant. and now he is really moving in me spiritually. the church service on sunday night about a passion for god,  that was really encouraging. and now i am reading a book called addicted to god that looks like it will really change me as a person. the first thing it said.  that being day 1, was to be thankful in all circumstances. not being thankful for the circumstance but being thankful in it. like the passage, "i complained that i had no shoes until i met a man that had no feet". how about that, pretty kool  hey.  oh and a special thank you for megan for the book. great b'day pressy!

      this is my longest post yet, feel proud. hows this for just a junior blogger aswell. Man this i will never forget!!! it was good fun but for some of it i had a pounding headache. for bit sit got better and i was able to be social but it always came back in really painful throbs. it had to be a migrane. then jamie hit me in the head with a really tough block of foam. well i did deserve it, that night i must have hit jemma so many times with various things. i feel so sorry for her. again jemma i am really sorry bout that.  on another note i played a really good practical joke on jamie. finally i got him bac for so much. hehehe, i am so proud of myself. well this is what happened. we are chucking crackers across the room, if you werent there dont ask, long story. but one landed on me and i saw that jamie was leaning forward and well my eye caught the fact that his boxers were showing clearly above his pants, so i jammed the cracker down his pants. he jumped out of his skin wondering what the hell just happened. so he pulled the cracker out and shoved it in my face. but i got him so good i didnt mind. the best part was that somehow cracker had gotton down his pants, he had to go get it out. like gone down his boxers. keeping in mind that i put the cracker between his pants and bloxers, and if jamie tells you different hes lying. ewan thought it was pretty good aswell.  beth and luke... well the only complaint i got between these two ppl are the appauling amount of sms messages they send each other. look i dont care who sends more cos the both of them say different things. luke 94 messages in a month, and beth easily more than 50 in a week and a half. either way its amazing how they manage it.  the things that jamie and his friends get up to is incredible. i so want to get involved. looks like great fun. personally i love practical jokes but never are able to do it, without getting someone angry. oh well, i got my fair share of them out in the winter sleepout last night and this morning. lsat weekend mike got initiated into the guys club, so ben the initiator got the crap kicked out of him. tom f was the last to be initiated. jeremy was the initiator in that case. tom got it pretty bad, uppercut to the equipment. feel the pain guys. on the same weekend jamie got his gooch vacuumed by dave lovel, man i am so proud of him. and the best thing about all of these things is that we at the winter sleepout got video footage of it all.  winter sleepout was great, good stuff guys, cant wait till next time..

      PEOPLE FROM THE SOUTH WILL UNDERSTAND THIS.. There was this fellow from Eastern Kentucky who had a flat tire. He pulled off on the side of the road, jumped out of his car, walked down the hillside and picked a bunch of wildflowers, and proceeded to put one bouquet of the flowers in front of the car and one behind it. Then he got back in the car to wait A passerby studied the scene as he drove by and was so curious he turned around and went back. He asked the fellow what the problem was. The man replied,             "I have a flat tarr." In response the passerby asked,             "But what's with the flowers?" The man responded,             "When you break down they tell you to put flares in the front and flares in the back! I never did understand it neither."

      People lend me your eyes. I have important news...  The Essendon football club played Port Adelaide on Saturday night.  Essendon having lost the last 5 of its past 6 matches... yeah damn. Personally I thought, and a lot of other ppl in football land, didnt give Essendon a hope to get into the finals let alone win it. We had been playing horrible football. loss after loss. But things have changed since then. Port Adelaide are one of the top teams in the competition at the moment, and really are in form. Going into this match every one would have been tipping Port to win this match. Not just because that they are a top team, but also backed up by the fact that Essendon are without so many of their star players. Their captain, Centre half forward, a defender, possibly our best one. Yet we won by 40 points. That is a huge victory!  Because of this i now have huge bragging rights to Lehamn(... how do you spell that?) and yes tonight at church you will see me in my Essendon guernsey.  Cu tonight  Tim

      Well today I went out to Bonds Nursery. Pity you don't work there anymore there Pete... hehehe I got some tomatoes, some phosphorus, some tomato duster to protect them from bugs and some fertilizer.  This is for Science. I have to do a SRP which is a student research project. It is my own experiment in which I am going to determine the affect of phosphorus in plants, and the necessity of it in fertilizers. Specifically the affect on tomatoes. fun fun fun... seriously, I looooooooooooooooooooove science, just ask Luke, he'll tell you; with conviction.
