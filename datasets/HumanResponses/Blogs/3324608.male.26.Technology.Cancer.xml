      *distorted electric guitars*   Duh, duh duhn ... da, da, da, da, dah ... duhn, dunh!     I am 45% evil?      I could go either way. I have sinned quite a bit but I still have a bit of room for error. My life is a tug of war between good and evil.     Are you evil  find out at  Hilowitz.com     Silly on-line tests!!!  I demand a re-count!  Some of the questions were only true because of stuff from my past, so I'm probaby less evil now, maybe 35% evil or so.  Either way, I'm more good that evil . . . so the battle is not lost.  Must  . . . keep . . . fighting . . . against . . . evil!

      My mother-in-law just forwarded an article to me titled "Are CD's forever?".     urlLink Article: Are CD's Forever?  Maybe Not    urlLink Defective CD's   The article basically states that experts are finding that CD's are not lasting as long as expected when they came on the market.  They were supposed to last a lifetime, but now we are finding that some CD's will not last a this long.  A CD could last 5 minutes if you drop it and it breaks or if it is sratched very badly.  A CD could last 40+ years if you keep it in it's case and always handle the disc by the edges . . . here is my response to the article:  ". . . If you keep your CD's in their cases when not in use and keep them clean, that they will last a long time.  CD's last longer and work better than any other medium for music and sound.   Records, when they are new, sound fantastic, but nobody can ignore the fact that they deteriorate and the sound quality gets worse each time you play them.  If dust gets on a record, when played it will crackle and pop.  Records warp and become unplayable if they get too hot.  Old records (pre 1960) become brittle and can break easily(i.e. shatter into many tiny pieces!).   Cassette tapes sound horrible.  They sound worse and worse the more times they are played and the older they get.  They can be totally destroyed if a cassette player randomly decides to eat them.  Cassettes seem to last about 5-15 years, depending how often they are played and how well they are taken care of.  After that they are almost worthless (in my opinion), because the sound quality is so poor.  Cassettes (also VHS tapes and data tapes) are very sensitive to humidity.  If they are not stored properly, they can become moldy and deteriorate in as little as 1 year (I have seen this happen!).   CD's (and DVD's), if well taken care of (stored in a case when not in use, not scratched or handled on the surface, and kept clean), should last AT LEAST 15 - 25 years (in my experience).  They will always sound just as good as they did the first time you listened to them.     Consumer recordable CD's (and DVD's) have only been around for maybe 10 years now, so only time will tell how long these will last, but studies have shown that by burning CD's at slower speeds of 2x - 4x, the music/data on the disc is likely to last much longer than burning at higher speeds.    urlLink How Permanent is CD-R Media?    When CD's came out, they were supposed to last "forever".  Humans are always looking for something that will last forever but, as we know, nothing lasts forever.  When you compare CD's to cassette tapes and vinyl records, it is obvious that CD's are the longest lasting medium we have now.  CD's last longer and sound infinitely better after a long period of time than do cassettes and vinyl.  Until the next big thing comes along, CD's and DVD's are currently the best choice for storing music, video, pictures and data."

      mood: content music: DJ Colette - Our Day  I just got back from a department lunch at the local Sizzler.  Mmmmm ... red meat!  I didn't used to like meat and didn't eat steak for years, but now I like it for some reason.  Maybe my body is lacking something.  The people in my department decided to walk back to work instead of take the train.  It was only 5 blocks - not too far, but I am hot now.  I want to have a cigarette and then take a nap, but alas, I am here at my desk ... not working.

      I can't get an SQL statement to work in my Access VB code . . . so close!  I had to take a break and think about something else for a few minutes.  This week is going by fast.  It's funny how time fly's when you have lot's to do.  "Idle time is the devil's workshop" (or something like that).  What is the opposite of idle time?  Hmmm . . . I'm eating Ho Ho's and drinking straight black coffee this morning.  Sometimes I like to dunk my "ho's" in my coffee.  Kind of like "Dunkin' Donuts", but instead I'm dunking Ho's . . . he he he.  My wife thinks Ho Ho's are gross, but I like 'em!  She especially despises the cheap Little Debbie ones.  They're great because you get like 8 for $1.25!  Mmmmm, snacky cakes . . . Oh, if she could see me now!  *dunk dunk*  *munchie munchie*

      Today, I have been married for a WHOLE year!  Strangeness . . . I never thought I would be married, but you meet the right. . . er, most amazing & beautiful person in the whole world (and they're cute!) . . . what are ya supposed to do?  Married life is great.  This last year has been so crazy and busy with school, work, being married (oh, and cats!), but it has most definately been the best year of my life.  I feel very lucky and blessed to be able to spend the rest of my life with my best friend and soulmate!  That's probably enough sappy stuff for now . . .

      It has been 25 hours since my last cigarette.  That is good news!  Quitting has been kind of tough, but not as bad as I thought it might be.  It's only the 2nd day, but everyone says the first week is the worst.  After 3 days, all the nicotine should be out of my system.  I usually only smoked 4-6 cigarettes a day.  Not very much compared to most smokers I know.  Sometimes on the weekend I would smoke 5-10 cigarettes a day, just because I get bored and it seemed like a good way to enhance my weekend relaxing experience.  That's kind of stupid, isn't it?  Yes, smoking can be enjoyable, but do I smoke because I really enjoy it and it makes me happy or do I smoke because I am an addict?  I am an addict.  I am addicted to smoking.  It's a dirty, wasteful, stupid habit and I don't need it anymore.  In the meantime, on some suggestions from  urlLink About.com: Quit Smoking , I bought some sunflower seeds (in the shell) to keep in the car.  They are kind of messy to eat and the spitting part is kind of gross, but they are great to keep my hands and mouth busy while I'm driving.  It definately keeps my mind off of smoking but maybe now, I'll become addicted to sunflower seeds?  At the gas station, I grabbed a couple of coffee stirring straws, cut them in half, and I have tried chewing on those when I go outside and at times when I would usually be smoking.  Also, I have been trying to drink more water because all the info I have read on quitting suggest to do so.  I need to buy some hard candy like Jolly Ranchers or something.  That would be a good thing to have around ...  So far, so good : )

      I had my last cigarette at 9:45am this morning   Reasons I am quitting smoking:  -Smoking is not a "sin", but a Christian who smokes is not a good example to friends, family and others . . . I want to be able to share my faith with others and not be embarrassed or feel guilty about smoking. -I want to be free from addiction in my life.  I don't want any substance or sin to have control over me. -I will save approximately $50 a month - money I could use to buy CD's, books or other fun stuff -I don't want to feel like a "second class citizen" anymore -For my health and to have a better quality of life   If you've quit smoking before, what worked well for you and what didn't?  I haven't really tried to quit before.  I was really sick with strep throat 2 weeks ago and, as a result, I didn't smoke for 6 days.  I decided it would be a good time to quit because I already had one week behind me, but I don't think I wanted to quit bad enough.   What improvements and changes can you make?  I can go in the office or out on the balcony to study and do homework   What will be your most challenging situations, and how do you plan to handle them?  My wife does not want to quit smoking.  I know she will help me to quit and support me in any way she can, but the fact is that she is still going to smoke.  It will be hard to resist smoking when I see cigarettes and cigarette boxes (full or empty) around the apartment.  When she smokes around me, it will be difficult to resist casually lighting up with her. Driving in the car, I will have urges to smoke ... but if I don't have cigarettes in the car I will be okay. Going out to the club and when I drink . . . I should stay away from those types of environments for at least a month When I'm at home with not much to do on the weekend ... I plan to take up eating Ben & Jerry's ice cream more regularly again.  If I am really fiending for a cigarette I will eat some nummy ice cream, followed by some kind of activity to make myself busy (homework, going for a walk, playing with the cats, going for a short drive, playing computer games maybe?) At school, I might be tempted to go out for a smoke between classes or on break ... I will not allow myself to go outside where the smokers congregate during school.   What can you do to change your environment to promote breaking the associations you have to smoking?  Avoid going out to the smoking area on breaks and lunch at work Talk to my wife about not smoking around me and not offering me cigarettes (not even giving me cigarettes if I ask for them)   What do you like about smoking?  It was new and interesting when I started 2 years ago At first, I liked trying all different kinds of cigarettes and I liked making my own cigarettes (sort of a hobby) I like smoking when I drink . . . I don't know why, they just kind of go together Part of me likes the rebellious aspect of smoking and being a smoker I like casually smoking while I read, study & do homework I like smoking while watching TV - I used to not even watch T.V. but now look at me ... debauchery!!!   :  ) I like to drive with my windows down and good music turned up loud while I have a cigarette I like the social aspect ... do I really?  What does that mean?   What do you hate about your addiction?  I hate the smell of my clothes and wondering if other people think I smell like an ashtray . . . I don't think I do but ... I am 26 years old and a married adult, but my parents, family and in-laws don't know I smoke (or maybe they do?).  I hate hiding part of my life from them.  It's such a stupid little thing in my mind, but I know it would make my parents and family very sad if they knew I smoked. I think I'm a fairly intelligent person, but smoking is bad for me and a horribly stupid thing to do.  I feel stupid knowing how terrible smoking is, but I still do it anyways.   Who can you count on for support?  My wife will help me in any way she can (sans-quitting herself), I know she will stand behind me in anything that I want to do. My friend, Darick - he smokes occasionally, but he's not a "smoker".  He will be cool with me quitting and he's someone I can talk to about it.  urlLink About.com: Quit Smoking Forum    What benefits do you envision in your smoke free life?  I will have more money to spend on other things (CD's, books, coffee . . . maybe even put some in savings) I won't have to live with the guilt of being a "closet smoker" I will have more energy and have a better chance at living a healthy life free from the complications that smokers face I won't feel like a bad Christian for smoking . . . I will be a better example to others and be able to share my faith with others more easily.

      "In my lifetime, I have made nearly 15,000 credit card transactions. I purchase almost everything on plastic. What bugs me about credit card transactions is the signing. Who checks the signature? Nobody checks the signature.    Credit card signatures are a useless mechanism designed to make you feel safe, like airport security checks. So my question was, how crazy would I have to make my signature before someone would actually notice . . ."   urlLink The Credit Card Prank   from: www.zug.com

       For the last 4 years, Norway has ranked as the best place to live in the world according to an annual United Nations study. Neighboring Sweden ranked at number two with Austrailia and Canada following in the third and fourth spots. Interestingly, the United States comes in at number eight.  The UN created the index in order to measure the extent of human development in countries around the world. Countries were ranked based on things like average income, life expectancy and education.  I have never considered moving out of the United States. We are taught that this is the greatest country in the world and that nobody else has the freedoms that we have here. I don't want to sound un-grateful or un-patriotic, but frankly, I'm scared about what is happening to this country and unsure about our future here. I don't know a lot about government and politics so I can't really point fingers to blame our leaders for the mess that we've gotten ourselves into. For the most part, I attribute all of our problems to the breakdown of the family which started a long time ago and seems to be getting worse. I feel sorry for the youth of this country who are overdosed daily on music, television and other media that lacks moral standards, promotes greed, violence, lust, and is completely void of any intellectual stimulation. The primary purpose of media in the U.S. today is to make money by selling airtime and products, nothing else matters. It's all about the bottom dollar. This is the kind of mentallity so many people in this country accept now, especially the youth. What's sad is that I see the gap growing wider between the rich and the poor. Millions of people don't have access to medical insurance and as a result, cannot get proper medical care. Our government is busy spending our tax money fighting a war on "terror" that is not supported by most of the world including many of our "so-called" allies. Anti-American sentiment is spreading throughout the world . . . what has happened to this once great country?  After reading an article about Norway having the top quality-of-life, made me think about a lot of things. There are countries out there who provide medical care to all of their people. Where unemployment and the number of homeless people is low. Where the average income is much higher than in the U.S. allowing people to take care of themselves and have all of the things they need to live and survive.  I did some research about Norway and found that the average income is a staggering $36,000 USD! They are very strict about wearing seat belts and have a low tolerence for drunk driving. The average life expectancy there is 79. The average Temperature in January is a chilly 26.6 degrees Farenheit compared to an average 63 degrees farenheit in July. The days are very short in the winter with only a few hours of daylight and the days are very long in the summer months with only a few hours of darkness.  I don't know for sure if I would ever take the giant leap to move out of the U.S. It would be a difficult thing to do, but given our current situation here I am definately more open to leaving this place then I would have ever expected. Living in Europe could be a very interesting, exciting and positive experience.  Here is a link to the article on Norway's official website:   urlLink  http://www.norway.org/News/200404Norway_undp.htm     Here is a link to Sweden's official website (in English):   urlLink  http://www.sweden.se/     The top 20 countries ranked by quality of life: 1. Norway 2. Sweden 3. Australia 4. Canada 5. Netherlands 6. Belgium 7. Iceland 8. United States 9. Japan10. Ireland 11. Switzerland 12. Britain 13. Finland 14. Austria 15. Luxembourg 16. France 17. Denmark 18. New Zealand 19. Germany 20. Spain
