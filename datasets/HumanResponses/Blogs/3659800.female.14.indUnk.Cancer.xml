      Katie Ann Wood.....I don't even know what words to say that describe except she is my best friend in the whole entire world. We have known eachother since we were a couple months old and from that day on we have been inseperable!! She is the only girl who knows me inside and out, the only girl I can talk to about personal things and trust. This girl is amazing and I seriously would die if I didn't have her today as one of my friends.I haven't seen her in a looooooong time, close to the new year and she just came over today! I was soexcited I didn't know what to do I screamed her name when she came and we talked about everything! sports, guyz, webster, kirkwood, friends, gossip, you name it we talked about it. This was cool, someone that I hadn't seen in a while came to my house!! we went to DTK and walked to Tropical Moose and the little park! We even ran throguh the fountain a few times.....anywayz what I guess I am geting to is that I love Katie so much and even though we live in different cities, we are the best friends ever! Each and every day I think about her and I miss her! I love you katie u my gurl 4 life!!!!!!! THE STUFF lol

      Yea it does. For me I care about my friends and family and who ever else are out there. Some people don't. Over the past year, I have created one of the most nerve recking and bad times of my life. I got new friends, most didn't work out. I tryed to fit in, most just pushed me away. I tryed to stay cool, they didn't let me. My life was once good, I had a smile on my face every day. Now, you could probably find me wiggling my way out of a smile into tears and a frown. I didn't want it to happen this way, but they did it to me. All I can say is that I tryed, I tryed real hard and they blew me off like I am a ghost. I found out who my real friends were too. The ones who stuck with me every step of the way, that didn't go ff on me for a little insadent or some mistake I made, the ones who cryed with me and told me it would be alright. Yea them. They are my true and real friends. The others I figured could go find them some bad friends, the ones they deserve to be with. Well for now I am done with trying and I will sit back and wait until my first day of highschool to get some new friends. The ones I need and want. Here we come, I hope life gets better cause I know a lot of people don't care at all what I am writing right now and are like fuck her, but I know the people who care for me know what I am going through and I love them for understanding me. peace

      Wow, from friday morning until tuesday night I had one of the best times in soccer as usual. Every year, when soccer season starts, I look forward to summer and going to State Cup. My team, Busch Marschuetz gets to play soccer day after day and trys to get to the championship. Well, we did that twice and now the past two years we've only managed to make it to the semi-finals. Our team wasn't too happy, I mean common who wants to loose?! Yea, i didn't think anyone would. Anywayz...what made us so mad is that we played the same team, (Coke Wave) went into over time both years, and finally got down to penalty kicks. It was DAY JA VOO all over again. O well I had sooo much freaking fun with my team mates which by the way are the cooles people on the planet, and met some new and interesting people such as......MATT MORELAND! wow that kid is amazingly great. No matter who was there, I was living it great and was happy that we switched hotels. Springfield Inn might have been the worst place alive! One bad thing though. Our team fell apart, during CUP, more than half of our team was injured, but luckily we could all play until the last game, semi-finals I hurt my ankle and I mean bad. It wasn't broken or anything but i couldn't walk on it or anything. Neither could my best bud allison a few dayz before me. O well we are ok now and are back on track! CUP was amazing once again and I thank the Lord each and every day how thank ful I am to have a coach like Denny double D!!! and the team mates that I am with every tuesday, thursday, and weekends. Try-Outs are in about a month or less and I am stoked for those!! woo hoo cya l8er
