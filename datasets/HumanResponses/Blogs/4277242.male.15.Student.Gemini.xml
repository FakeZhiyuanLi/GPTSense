       I see the most politically incorrect list in the "Most Blarsted Blog Ever" as stated in the links bar. But then, xiaxue.blogspot.com did not have to be politically correct.      "...These are the JIAK KAN TANG (eat potato) people who meet so often.[...] I HATE SUCH PEOPLE. Wait, hate is not enough, let's make it CURSE THEM ALL TO ETERNAL HELL.      Most of these people would be   1) Speaking with a stupid American/any other "superior English" accent   2) Coming from English-speaking girl and boy schools like ACS or MGS   3) Constantly whining about a lack of freedom and space in SG.   4) Saying Singapore sucks and they would fly away at their youngest age possible.   5) Have freckles"      Let's just say that I need space to rant...      You (whoever wrote that or whoever else that has same thoughts about my linguist minority) are an ignorant rant and an idiot. We have the rights to speak English with accents! It is absolutely not that we want to be someone else other than Singaporean, we like to do this kind of thing! For the damn-bloody fun of it! We know we are the ethnic Chinese and we don't the bloody-flopping-helluva-hell want to be non-Singaporeans at all! It's appreciating other cultures, and aint that what we the Singaporeans have been crazy that larst decade?! Damn you racist bastard! Damn you the National Socialist rottweiler! Damn you   people who ostracise us language-players for our language!      You know about how our sort of people feel confined here? It's all with people like you! People that will dao us when we greet them! People that murmur back whatever you are saying! People who insult you! I had ten-whole-months of clinical depression because of people like you! Patriots? Bah!    Where has the greenery gone? Where did the stars go? Is it not you who took the charms off the trees? Is it not you who took the glitter off the skies? What is life when you live with people who hate you? What is life when you live with the land that shirks from you? It is not life at all! It is hell! The bloody hell hell! And I lived it for ten months!      What is your love for your country? Is it love at all? No! It is xenophobia! I had not been ashamed to call myself Singaporean. I was proud! When I see you, I have second thoughts! How can you inject such vulgar mindsets into what makes us Singaporean? We don't deserve this! How can you deem countries lousier? The Africans don't deserve this either! You are IMMATURE. You have the physique of an adult and the mind of an angry child. I wouldn't be surprised if I tilted your head and shook it your brain cells will come out through your ear-hole.      How could you insult potatoes? How could you so blatantly label potatoes as ang-mor? Back at my granny's home in China, we eat our bloody potatoes too! In my school canteen, we eat the bloody potatoes too! And it isn't even the western food stall! Potatoes are good for you! You are an idiot who can even discriminate against food! Congratulations!      PS: I am not a bloody kantang! I am what you say is a kantang! If everyone on this isle thinks like you, it's to hell with racial harmony! Bye.      Please be reminded that this is all spontaneous ranting. Please don't sue me if you are pissed off by my above essay. Just send a comment. Politeness goes a long long way...

       Got to know that I'm getting a trophy for Projects Day. A trophy! It has been a long time since the last time I received one in June, and that one's made up of cheap plastic that dribbles in my hands!      I'm supposed to slack today. It's such a pity (after pride) that I have been put in charge of something, which needs to be done long ago, last week. When the authorities in school discovered that the deadline loomed close, pressure travelled in transverse waves from top-dog to unter-dog.      Hey yon fellow adolescent, slacking is not enough: enjoy slacking!

       It's just another day... another day when we were visiting Ying Yan's house. And oh how surprised was I to see that our old friend Xie Huan was there too.      It wasn't a nice surprise.      Ages of experience dissolved into layers of sedimentary wealth of my mind told me. When you saw those two people at the same time, you usually don't get to talk. (Most of the time, they talk) We are under one roof, in two different bubbles: Me in my own, them in theirs. Homework suddenly takes up a large part of my concenteration. (That or whatever book I am holding when the demonic self-enclosement strikes.) The day passes as hand and brain make painstaking progress through the maths assignment. Geesz. I hate linear laws.      So that was the title.      The first pingpong event today is painful to watch. Li lost! If not for everyone's animal desires (i.e. to eat), we would have fasted for three days. Where nationalism is least expected, it comes and knocks everyone off their chairs; Julie begins to hate Koreans! Ah all the stories about her tearing up the pic of Kim into little pieces and crying whole night...      The worst was not over   until I got insomnia and did not sleep until 5 in the morning.

       The title for this entry is my first go at alternative languages (the "in" people call this conlangs) long ago in the Jurassic ages of 2003. Named Saschen-Gaelic, this language is churned out in a cheap way that is replacing English words with those who sound exactly the same but spelt according to the Irish spelling system (mostly). Similar languages are Brithenig (P-celtic-romance) and Breathnach (Q-celtic-romance) mixing welsh or irish with latin stuff. Its practical use is in the heraldric mottos of Thomond studios ("Pár-Árt Pár-Úíosðaim Pár-Paisge")      That was the title.      What really happened in the Holocene epoch are two really interesting table tennis events on at the Olympics today. Both are women's events, and both have one side of the table that the family is interested in. The first one is China against South Korea. Whoa. Darned coool. Dad counted thirty passes in one point. Zhang Yining and Kim Kyung Ah are making each other's lives hell. The ball parted the air in long shallow arcs as bats swung with bloodlust.      The one featuring our other supportee, Li Jiawei and the other Kim, was more "violent" (cited from mum) but I think thas was because Kim was shouting all the time. To me they were like, meticulously pushing the ball around, and this gives an atmosphere that to me seems similar to Judo. You didn't try to distract the opposition and kick him in his stomach. You just tried to push the responsibilities to the other and wait for the opposition to send the ball strolling into the net. And OMG the scores are so close! Whoa whoa whoa... Singapore lost by a little margin. Really little. Three or four points. It's like Simon getting into Grand Finals and me just getting the A* in my Project.      --STOP PRESS--   Li beat Kim 11-0 in the second game. So I'm told. Lololololol my flank is in imminent danger of exploding.

      Well, if you're travelin' in the north country fair, Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline, Remember me to one who lives there. She once was a true love of mine.  Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm, When the rivers freeze and summer ends, Please see if she's wearing a coat so warm, To keep her from the howlin' winds.  Please see for me if her hair hangs long, If it rolls and flows all down her breast. Please see for me if her hair hangs long, That's the way I remember her best.  I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all. Many times I've often prayed In the darkness of my night, In the brightness of my day.  So if you're travelin' in the north country fair, Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline, Remember me to one who lives there. She once was a true love of mine.

       When everyone wants to be "different", it's only a matter of time before everyone turns out different in the same way.      Extreme convergent evolution?      When there is ever someone  really  being different (that is, in a different way of course), the adolescent society will tag him as a sick freak, beat him up and perform a parade in which the different person is tied to a horse-drawn cart by his feet and dragged around the streets.

      Today is going to be yesterday tomorrow, and the day before that, after that. Some things are just meant to to change. Incidentally if you'd keep a thing simple two more things will end up botched up.  Today I have decided to take a righteous action to the school canteen, which sells mostly useless trash they call food, like potato topped with "sour cream", a vile suspension that looks like wet plaster and tastes like stale yoghurt, and "munchies", a lethal object even the crows would fly away from (proven by an experiment performed by Lenard). Past crimes involving rotten food in this canteen includes a sandwich of a mysterious inedible pink paste, a tray full of tasteless pasta, a tray full of tasteless hokkien mee, and (lots more).  I am boycotting the school canteen! I will go to HCJC forever to eat lunch and will come down to the school canteen only for the odd tuna sandwich (which is not mysterious), curry chicken rice (too genuine to be suspected as something else) and drinks. HCJC canteen sells tasty and energy-replenishing roti plata there, and the HC students sure look happier than us for now!  Blunderbusses at the ready --  Shoot down the Western Food stall! Shoot down the Western Food stall! Shoot down the Western Food stall!  I also announce that the condition in which a blogger starts to enthusiastically publish articles on obscure songs be named "The Second Day in Dunmore Cave Syndrome." If you want to use it you have to cite sources.

      We can rule you wholesale is the national anthem of the fictional city state of Ankh-Morpork in the Discworld series of fantasy novels by Terry Pratchett.  It was not written by a native Ankh-Morporkian, but by the visiting vampire Count Henrik Shline von Überwald (born 1703, died 1782, also died 1784, 1788, 1791, 1802, 1804, 1807, 1808, 1821, 1830, 1861, finally staked 1872). His inspiration came from his observations that Ankh-Morpork's chief means of defence was not warfare but corruption, bribery and mercantile tactics, since most the weapons used against the city were actually made there in the first place.  The anthem is particularly noteworthy for being the only one that has a second verse officially constisting of incoherent muttering. Count von Uberwald had also made the observation that any group of people singing their country's national anthem never remembers how the second verse goes anyway, so he decided to make things easier for Ankh-Morpork.  In formal occasions, the anthem is supposed to be performed by a large soprano singer wearing a sheet and holding a torch in one hand and a fork in the other.  "When dragons belch and hippos flee My thoughts, Ankh-Morpork, are of thee Let others boast of martial dash For we have boldly fought with cash We own all your helmets, we own all your shoes We own all your generals - touch us and you'll lose. Morporkia! Morporkia! Morporkia owns the day! We can rule you whoselsale Touch us and you'll pay.  We bankrupt all invaders, we sell them souvenirs We ner ner ner ner ner, hner ner hner by the ears Er hner we ner ner ner ner ner Ner ner her ner ner ner hner the ner Er ner ner hner ner, nher hner ner ner (etc.) Ner hner ner, your gleaming swords We mortgaged to the hilt Morporkia! Morporkia! Hner ner ner ner ner ner We can rule you wholesale Credit where it's due."  The final part of the anthem is usually sung much louder than the rest of the second verse, since the singers want to show they know the words...  The anthem was actually written in 1999 by Pratchett (words) and Carl Davis (music), for the BBC Radio 3 programmme The Music Machine. It was performed by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and the soprano was Clare Rutter. It was also performed at that year's Proms by the Prommers' Orchestra and Chorus.  -- from wordiq.com

       Lolololol.   There always seems to be a sense of uneasiness when I create a new, brand new, blog. Writer's block comes where it is most unlikely to strike me in THE FIRST ENTRY. I herefore name this phenomenon "The First Day in Dunmore Cave Syndrome" and declare it unique to ME. If you suffer from the same thing you'll have to find your own name.
