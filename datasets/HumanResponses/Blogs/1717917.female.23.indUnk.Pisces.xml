       I am home now from my road trip.  And I hate Florida.  I can already feel the weight of loneliness hovering by me.  Lest you think I am overly dramatic, consider once again my situation, and then also remember that I live with my parents.  There isn't going to be somebody asking me to come over at 9:45ish anymore.  I will come home, watch TV for a few hours, play around on the computer, maybe talk to her on the phone, and that will be my life.    It makes me feel very very sick.

       is leaving this weekend to move to Seattle.  We're taking a road trip across the country and then I'll be flying back.  It'll take us about five days and I think we're probably going through about 10 states.    Now you have to understand, because I have known this girl for about 3 months max and I feel like I've known her my whole life.  I was floundering here in Florida before we met on a strange occasion.  Abandoned, alone, quite lost.  So masked and internal it was disgusting.  And sure I'm still struggling through some of that.  But I probably haven't been as happy as I am now in over a year.    Needless to say, this is not the most exciting thing in the world--her leaving.  Instead, I'm terrified of falling back into feeling the way I felt before.  The solution I hear most often?  "Then you better get out and meet some people."  And where do you suggest I do that.  I'm sure I'd find really good quality people at bars, which I visit somewhat frequently, and clubs, which I never visit somewhat infrequently.  (past statement heavily laden with sarcasm)  So explain to me, where else does one go?    Mind you I work till 9:30 or 10 at night.    So I have gained and will lose one of the greatest individuals I have had the opportunity to encounter in a short amount of time. I will be alone again.  I will claw my way to eventual recovery.    And maybe I'll just have to move out west.

       I am so glad to have a job.  It pays for my car, my food, my shelter, etc. etc.  But as soon as I get another job lined up, I'm putting in my two weeks notice.  Or better yet, if it wouldn't affect my future job apps, I would do something to get me fired or walk out and quit on the spot.    The new thing that's kind of thrown it off the edge is that we're now in the business of serving water and towels.  My boss brought in a silver tray and now we're supposed to fill up cups with water and take them around to see if people want water.  First of all, I don't work at a country club, I work at a YMCA.  Second, people don't want us to bug them and serve water.  Third, I didn't get a 4-year degree in exercise science to walk around with a silver tray with water cups while people laugh at me.  I got it to teach people how their body works and how to make it work for them.  So I refuse to do it.  We'll see how long the idea stands.    So I've been revamping my resume to kick butt status.  And it will go out all over the world, and I can't wait to sift through the numerous offers for millions and millions...  or at least the offers that have me moving out west... and not carrying a silver tray...

       I've been sitting here for the past five minutes trying to figure out what it is that I want to get out of me and here onto this computer screen.    I feel like a fake.  Like I put on this big facade of someone who's okay with life.  I mean sure, I have normal things that everyone deals with:  I don't LOVE my job, I'm unhappy with my lack of involvement with the opposite sex, etc. etc.  But people don't know that I come home and when I get alone I don't like myself.  When I'm alone in the morning before I go to work, I'm rarely happy.    I'm not saying that every Joe Schmoe has a right to see these things or should be exposed to these things.  What I am saying is that I don't feel like I can even show these things to all of the people (save one) who love me and are supposed to accept me unconditionally.    And I feel like a schmuck for thinking these things about myself.  I mean, God, get over yourself, Brooke.  Really.  You make yourself feel the way you do.  You like having "problems" and being "tormented" so that people don't know you and you're mysterious and you have this alter life.    Does the fact that I go for help mean that the above is not true, or does it make it more true?  I can see it both ways, and the fact that I can see it both ways makes me uncomfortable.  But you know what, I would like to be a happy person.  I would like to be content with my present situation (whatever that may be) even if I'm not necessarily content with every aspect of my life.
