      I was just curious to know what does my name mean. So asked the Google to do the job for me,hehe.This was the description i got on the net;  " The name of   urlLink Vallabhi   has created a congenial nature with the desire to associate in friendship and understanding both socially and in the business world. Peaceful and settled conditions appeal to you and you are naturally desirous of having the security of a home, where your life could follow a definite pattern, and where you would not have to make major decisions. You find it difficult to take a definite stand, partly because you lack confidence, and also because you dislike any issues which create dissension between people. Procrastination is a weakness of your nature, causing an inability always to complete your plans or to concentrate for long "

      Wow!!! I'm named after a Jain University, hehe, people just keep askin' me, what's the meaning of my name, pheeww!!!!! I always tell them , its a name of a Jain University in Gujarath. Its indeed an unique name.The credit would definitely go to my dad who is a "history-lover". Even today most of my dad's frds mention in their mails - "How is your University" ?? hehe...  I moved to South at a very young age, as dad was alloted Tamilnadu as his Cadre,ppl here never ever pronounced my name correctly,  many a times,I was called as "Vallabhai",and what not!!..Some even changed my surname from "Shegaonkar" to "Jahangir", huh!! ..It was like "Vallabhai Jehangir",hehe..  sunkar hi hansi aathi hein ....I got so much fed up with this and at one point of time, I even felt like changing my name to "Pallavi", as it sounds-like "Vallabhi"..but dad didnt allow me to do so..Good! or else i would lost the uniqueness in my name, hehe...    Vallabhi - The Jain University   Vallabhi University achieved as much fame as Nalanda. The Maitraka kings who ruled Western India constructed a monastery at Vallabhi their capital. While Nalanda was the centre for Mahayana Buddhism, Vallabhi achieved fame as the centre for Hinayana Buddhism. The Maitraka kings spent lavishly to maintain their university. They gave every encouragement and assistance to Buddhist studies at this institution. In the 7th century Vallabhi was as prosperous and famous as Nalanda. Hieum Tsang visited Vallabhi, and reported in his "Ta-Tang-Si-Yu-Ki" as follows:  -"The population of Vallabhi is very large. The country is rich and prosperous. There are over a hundred millionaire families there. Imported luxury goods are seen in this city. There are about 100 monasteries with about 6,000 Buddhist monks. Most of them belong to the Sammitiya Sect. There are also many Hindu temples and a large Hindu population in this past of the country. The Buddha had visited this land during his ministry. There are stupas erected by King Asoka to mark the spots hallowed by the Buddha’s visit."  There are about 100 shrines and about 6,000 resident monks studying at Vallabhi. They do not believe that Abhidharma was the teaching of the Buddha. They believed in the Antarabhava doctrine and were exponents of Puggalavada a traditions that disregards Abhidharma teachings that are inconsistent with the Sutra-Teachings.

						    1. How to fight aging   Did you know that just walking for 30 minutes, 3 or 4 times a week is enough to combat aging? According to researchers at the University of California, one of the principle causes of deterioration of the human organism’s physical faculties is its diminished ability to metabolize glucose. And they showed that even leisurely exercise, like taking a walk, plays an important role in keeping glucose metabolism functioning smoothly. Do you spend the whole day sitting at your desk or in front of a computer screen? Why not get up occasionally and do a few minutes of physical exercise? Don’t worry about what other people think. In some Japanese companies, it is even become a collective habit. Every twenty minutes a bell sounds, and everybody gets up to do some stretching exercises, after which they sit down again as if nothing had happened. Japanese managers are convinced that their employees are more productive when they are relaxed.   2. Are you anxious?   Is worrying one of your characteristics? Well, stop! It is okay to worry, but at the right time. Psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania tell patients who suffer from anxiety to regularly do a daily twenty minute “worry session,” always at the same time and in the same place. Collect your head full of worries during the day (don’t suppress them!) and then pour them out during your daily worry session.Exaggerate your worries to the point of absurdity - knit your brows, make faces, let the sweat flow, shake and cower as much as you like. In other words, make a caricature of the part of yourself that is always worried, and in so doing exorcise it.Eliminating worry will help prevent numerous psychosomatic illnesses, which result from living in a state of permanent anxiety.   3. Care for your heart   while you sleep In which position do you sleep?If you sleep on your stomach or on your left side, you are putting pressure on your heart with the extra body weight, while the heart has to continue pumping blood as usual.This additional burden wears the heart out more quickly. Think about it - you spend more than one third of your life sleeping! To reduce the strain on your heart, sleep on your right side, or on your back. This simple technique will add years to your life.   4. How to avoid cancer   It's caused by smoking.If you smoke, you can greatly reduce the risk of contracting cancer by drinking carrot juice. This according to the German Doctor Hans Nieper, founder of Eumatabolic Medicine, a new alternative mode of treatment which has become very popular in Germany. The carotene found especially in carrots prevents and can even cure cancer.   Dr. Nieper states, “If you smoke 60 cigarettes a day but drink 4 glasses of carrot juice, you will still be less prone to contract cancer than someone who doesn’t smoke but who doesn’t drink carrot juice.” Of course, if you don’t smoke and do drink carrot juice all the better!   5. Avoid eye problems   It's caused by T.V. and monitors.The eye was not made to be constantly focused on close objects. If your work requires that you stare at a computer screen all day long or if you watch a lot of television, stop from time to time to do a few eye exercises. For example, roll your eyes in large circles in both directions;look over to each side as far as possible and then go from up to down; or scan an imaginary text on the wall from left to right; or look out the window as far as you can following the horizon then return to a point right in front of you and begin again.In this way, you will avoid long term eye problems, you will enlarge your inner space, and relax both your eyes and your mind.   6. How to beat asthma   Asthma partially obstructs the bronchial tubes, making breathing difficult. The cause of asthma is still not known. But if you are an asthma sufferer, you can, through natural means, considerably reduce the number of asthma attacks you get.A placebo study has shown that asthmatics who consume 1 gram of vitamin C per day had 4 times fewer attacks. When they stopped taking vitamin C, the attacks resumed with the same frequency as before. As for magnesium, it also works wonders! Dr. Zack H. Haddad of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Southern California conducted a study on thirty children suffering from asthma associated with allergies.Twenty of them drank a daily amount of mineral water rich in magnesium, while the others received no magnesium supplement. After three months, the first group had a higher level of magnesium in their blood, and they were able to breathe more easily. So taking vitamin C and magnesium is an excellent way to prevent asthma attacks.But what can you do to breathe more easily during an attack?Simply drink 2 or 3 cups of strong coffee. By activating blood circulation, it eases respiratory blockage.  In addition, the American Lung Association recommends the following exercise: l. While standing, contract all your muscles. Keep them contracted for a few seconds. 2. Release the muscles, like letting the air out of a balloon. Relax all your muscles completely until you feel like a limp cloth. 3. Let yourself fall to the floor, and stretch out. Close your eyes and relax your face and your feet. 4. Imagine that you are floating on water. Concentrate on the effect the earth’s gravity has on your muscles and on the pleasant feeling of being completely relaxed. 5. Breathe gently and quietly, as if you were about to fall asleep. 6. Open your eyes.  Practising this exercise when you feel an attack coming on, or once it is already started, will help you overcome your asthma condition.   7. Losing weight: The Pakistani method   Pakistani women have an amazing trick they use to stay slim: they keep a string permanently tied around their forearms. According to Dr. Drupas, a gentle but constant pressure on the nerves in the forearm stimulates certain glands, particularly those involved inweight control (thyroid, suprarenals).Why don’t you try it? Find two ordinary rubber bands and place them around your right forearm, one third of the way up between your wrist and elbow.The rubber bands should exert noticeable pressure without cutting off blood circulation and should not slip or slide when you move your arm. This is not a tourniquet!For best results, you have to wear the rubber bands constantly,even at night when you sleep. It is also recommended not to wear any other jewelry on the right arm.    8. What to do when you get something in your eye   Got some dust in your eye? Or some other irritant like an eyelash or cigarette ash? You can use the following technique to help others as well as yourself. Before doing anything, make sure you don’t do what you absolutely shouldn’t: rub or press the eye, lift the eyelid, or remove contact lenses without washing your hands.  How to proceed? · Examine your eye. Is it red? Swollen? Is it tearing? What do you feel? Does it itch? Burn? Is your vision blurred? · Let nature do its work - it is usually effective. Tears and natural eye movements will usually get rid of the irritation. · Try rinsing your eye with some warm water, or with drops. You can pull on the skin around the eyes, but don’t touch the eyelid. · If this doesn’t work, wash your hands, and then lift both the upper and lower eyelids to locate the irritant. Is it on the inside of one of the eyelids, or is it stuck to the eyeball itself? Pour some sterilized, warm water on your eye to flush the irritant out. · If you can’t locate the irritant or if the discomfort persists after you have removed the particle, you would better consult a doctor.    9. A few tricks for treating insect bites   You don’t have to sit back and just passively put up with insects,especially those that like to bite (mosquitoes, wasps etc.). Eat asparagus and your sweat will develop an odor that repels insects. Or apply lemon oil to your skin.If you are bitten, there are natural substances to soothe the irritation. Aloe vera has extraordinary powers of soothing skin disorders. It is available in forms for both internal and external application in most health and beauty stores.If you have one of these amazing plants growing at home, cut the tip off one of the leaves (the leaf will heal itself). Apply the pulp and juice to the itching or swollen area.Lightly boiled cabbage or leek makes an excellent analgesic poultice. Of course, if you are hiking in the woods, you might have a little trouble finding cabbage! Plantain also works well. Cut it and rub it to get to the juice then apply it to the affected area.    10. How to get rid of liver spots   If you have liver spots, it is up to you to get rid of them. May be you took too much sun, without using the proper precautions like sunscreen, gradual exposure, etc. If you continue ignoring your skin in this way, you might end up looking like a lizard! Liver spots can also result from a thyroid deficiency. The thyroid gland must therefore be stimulated through a variety of means. For example, brown seaweed tablets: take one a day every morning, for fifteen days a month.Or apply a cream composed of 1 teaspoon oxygenated water and 4 1/2 tablespoons lanovaseline every morning and night.Aloe vera (see previous chapter) is very effective in treating skin disorders. Daily application of aloe vera over a period of time can eliminate liver spots completely. Also take a look at your nutrition: the real problem might lie in what you do or don’t eat, like a diet too high in fat.   11. Treat diarrhea without medication   If you have ever been to a tropical country, you have probably experienced diarrhea: frequent and uncontrolled evacuation of liquid stool caused by bacteria in local water, milk or food.Diarrhea can also be caused at home by excesses in diet (a diet that is too rich) or an allergic reaction to certain foods or medication or even by stress. To treat diarrhea, avoid all solid food on the first day. Drink liquids like water, apple juice, meat or vegetable boullion and tea. These will compensate for your loss of water - dehydration being one of the main dangers of diarrhea - and will give your intestines a period of rest. If you have stomach cramps, rub your hands together for about a minute. Then place both palms on your abdominal region. The heat will soothe the pain. On the second day, eat small quantities of solid food. Among the least irritating are cooked cereals (especially rice), biscuits and soft boiled eggs. You can also try charcoal. It comes in tablet or capsule form (you can also get it off burnt toast!)Chinese medicine has always considered ginger one of the best remedies for diarrhea. Dilute a tablespoon in hot water and add honey.   12. Use seaweed to stimulate your immune system   Japanese seaweed possesses remarkable immunizing properties, especially in fighting cancer. Japanese researchers at the University of Kitasato have discovered 6 kinds of seaweed which inhibit the growth of colon cancer cells in rats, notably two types of Laminaria. Laminaria extract has proven 70% to 84% effective in suppressing intestinal tumors. Wakame, another Japanese seaweed, is now familiar to many Westerners, thanks to the arrival in the west of Japanese macrobiotic cooking, which uses it a lot. Pharmacologists at the University of Hawaii injected rats with an extract of this substance. They found that the seaweed helped prevent and cure cancer. The researchers claim that Wakame fights cancer by activating and strengthening the immune system. It can be found in most health food stores.   13. How to prevent motion sickness - naturally   Did you know that half a teaspoon of ground ginger is more effective than chemical medication in suppressing motion or sea sickness? And unlike most medication, it will not make you drowsy. Ginger has been used in the Orient for centuries to prevent sea sickness. Researchers asked subjects who were especially susceptible to motion sickness to sit in a reclining chair that spun around at high speed. All the subjects who ingested a well known medication or who took a placebo experienced violent nausea and/or vomiting. On the other hand, six of the twelve subjects who took ginger twenty minutes before the test experienced no discomfort. They consumed only 840 milligrams of ground ginger, which is the equivalent of half a teaspoon. The Japanese have a very curious method of treating all kinds of motion sickness. They use an adhesive plaster to fasten an “umeboshi” (a very salty fermented plum, available in most health food stores in the West) to their navel. The idea may seem a little strange, but what have you got to lose!    14. The anti-allergy vitamin   So much has been said in praise of Vitamin C. So it is not surprising that it is also effective in treating allergic reactions like hayfever. We recommend taking Vitamin C in the form of ascorbate rather then ascorbic acid. When taken in ascorbic acid form, it can cause gastro-intestinal disorders. To fight an allergic reaction, you should consume up to 8 grams. 5 grams are necessary, on average. Start with a dose of 3 grams. Every three hours, take another 1 or 2 grams, until the symptoms disappear completely.   15. How to prevent Flatulence (Aerophagy)   Aerophagy results simply from “eating” air. The condition is not dramatically serious, but it does bloat the stomach and can prove embarrassing (stomach gurgles, etc.) How to prevent it? Above all chew your food properly and savor it fully. Swallowing too much is a direct cause of aerophagy. So don’t swallow needlessly. Don’t drink a lot when you eat. Avoid tobacco and alcohol,cabbage, radishes, doughy bread, strong spices and bubbly drinks.Don’t eat food that is too hot or too cold.And pay attention to the kinds of food you eat together: make a note of any combination that seems to provoke an attack and avoid it in future.    16. How to put an end to heartburn   Heartburn usually results from excess acidity in the stomach, or from improper functioning of your digestive system. At the point where the esophagus and stomach join, a special muscle opens and closes the esophagus. When we swallow food this muscle relaxes to let the food pass into the stomach after which it closes again. But it can happen that the muscle malfunctions. The contents of the stomach then rise back up the esophagus, irritating the area. And this results in the infamous feeling of heartburn. How to stop it? Avoid acidic foods (lemons, etc.), alcohol, fat or fried food, food that is overcooked, coffee, juice, tomato base products and chocolate. But don’t deprive yourself too much. Rather, observe which foods bring on heartburn and avoid them. Also, don’t go to sleep right after eating (you should eat supper around 7 o’clock) and don’t smoke, especially after meals.   17. A miracle remedy   If we offered you a miracle remedy that prevents cardiac disease, certain types of cancer, diabetes, obesity, tooth decay and varicose veins, would you buy it? Certainly you would. There is such a product. But it is not a recent discovery and you won’t find it in a pharmacy but at the grocery store. We are talking about fiber. A study conducted in Holland on 871 men, over a period of ten years, showed that subjects who had a low fiber diet were three times more susceptible to mortal disease - causes notwithstanding - than those who ate a lot of fiber (Future Youth). This said, it cannot be confirmed at present that fiber prevents the above mentioned diseases in all cases. But there is conclusive proof that they occur more frequently in populations with low fiber diets which is precisely the case in the west.  According to The Lancet (the British Medical Journal) a diet which contains at least 37 grams of fiber per day (the equivalent of one cup of bran, one apple, one potato and a half cup of cooked spinach) can effectively protect the organism against chronic illnesses common to western society. So fiber is useful in combatting many disorders besides constipation.   LOW FIBER FOODS:   Notably white bread (since fiber is removed in white flour), beef, pork, chicken, milk, butter, cheese, sugar, processed meats, desserts, fish, seafood and noodles.   GOOD SOURCES OF FIBER:   . Fruits: especially apples and prunes. · Vegetables: potatoes with their peel, spinach, artichokes, cabbage, peas. · Whole grains: barley, whole wheat (you should eat whole wheat bread because of the bran it contains), oats, corn. · Nuts: peanuts and almonds. · Dried fruit: apricots, plums, figs, dates. · Legumes: soy beans, lima beans, lentils, chick peas. Note that there are numerous types of fiber, and that you should alternate between them. For example, the fiber contained in apples and the fiber in cereals are both essential, since they don’t have the same digestive function.    18. Reducing your cholesterol   To reduce cholesterol: · First cut down on saturated fats. To do this: · Eat lean meat. Select lean cuts and ask your butcher to cut off the fat. · Drink skim milk instead of whole milk. Do the same for all dairy products. Note that vegetarians have a much lower cholesterol level (almost twice as low as average) which is perfectly understandable, since cholesterol is only found in products derived from animals. · Alcohol - in moderation. Not more than two glasses a day. However, it does appear that drinking a moderate amount of alcohol raises the number of HDL lipids (the good ones!), which break down cholesterol. (Moderation = two 4 oz. glasses of wine or two 12 oz. beers.) · Do regular exercise, for example walking. · Take Vitamin E. It reduces the risk of coronary disease. · Calcium brewer’s yeast, Vitamin C and Vitamin B-6 also combat the accumulation of cholesterol. And don’t forget lecithin, which helps fight excess cholesterol, arteriosclerosis, hypertension and angina (as well as psoriasis, anxiety and diabetes - and reduces the likelihood of contracting cancer). Losing weight is a good way to raise your HDL level. · Use poly-unsaturated, non-hydrogenated, cold pressed oil: corn oil, sunflower seed oil, soy, flax etc. A mono-unsaturated oil like olive oil can even raise your HDL level. · Daily consumption of fish would be ideal for preventing cardio-vascular problems, as demonstrated conclusively in a number of studies on fish-eating populations (Eskimos for example). Ideally, you would eat fish twice a day. And as strange as this sounds, you should select the fattest kinds: mackerel, sardines, herring, salmon etc. As for the oil in the fish, it is used to treat arterial disorders. Its effects can be felt in about six weeks. Fish oil contains two poly-unsaturated fatty acids which are very beneficial for the arteries.    19. Digest better   There is a plant for each type of digestion problem.  ·  AIGREMOINE  is useful when the stomach problem is accompanied by enteritis, diarrhea and/or chronic liver infection. It helps tone a lazy digestive system. And it also helps regularize acidity and soothe ulcers by improving metabolism. 3 or 4 cups a day. 3 1/2 to 4 tablespoons per quart of water.  ·  ANGELICA  is a digestive, an aperitif, a stimulant, a tonic. It decongests and soothes stomach pains and swelling. Prepare an infusion (tea) preferably using the fresh plant: 3 1/2 tablespoons of roots per quart of water. If your stomach is very swollen, prepare and drink 3 cups per day made of 5 tablespoons of seeds per quart of water.  ·  ANISE  is a soothing digestive. It aids digestion and the elimination of intestinal gas, it soothes stomach cramps, aerophagy, dyspepsia (contractions of the digestive organs, dizziness and a heavy feeling after eating). 2 or 3 cups per day, after meals: 2 tablespoons of seeds per quart of water.  ·  CAMOMILE : a digestive, sedative, anti-inflammation agent and tonic. It helps painful or difficult digestion, stomach cramps,gastro-intestinal spasms, loss of appetite, and it helps expulsion of gas(carminative). Particularly recommended for persons who suffer fromstomach cramps (and/or who are irritable, temperamental, angry etc.)One cup of infusion, a half hour before meals, or one hour after. To prepare the infusion, add 5 1/2 tablespoons to a quart of boiling water and let stand for five minutes.  · CHERVIL: digestive, depurative and diuretic. It also acts as a stimulant. For difficult digestion, drink 2 or 3 cups per day. Prepare an infusion with one teaspoon of dried leaves per cup of water, and let stand for 10 minutes.  · SAGE: The ancients had a saying - “Why die when your garden is full of sage!” It is a digestive, diuretic, antispasmodic and helps combat hypoglycemia.It stimulates the appetite, fortifies the stomach and aids digestion,especially when digestion is difficult. It is also a general tonic. 2 or 3 cups of infusion per day. 1 1/2 tablespoons of dried leaves per quart of water.     20. Menstrual cramps - suffer no more!   To reduce the intensity of menstrual symptoms, you can change your diet: · Less sugar, and slightly more protein. · Diuretic foods such as eggplant, cucumbers and parsley can help diminish water retention. · Calcium supplements (1 gram per day) and magnesium (500 milligrams) can help reduce anxiety (always take both). · Vitamin B-6 (not more than 50 milligrams per day) can alleviate symptoms of anxiety and tension. · Vitamins E and C also help reduce the intensity of cramps. · Aspirin has a mildly soothing effect. · And once again you can turn to plants to relieve your pains: * ANGELICA in infusion: 3 1/2 tablespoons of root per quart of water. * MATRIX (derived from the Latin for womb): 2 teaspoons of flowers per quart of water. * MILFOI OR YARROW which soothes and reduces overly abundant menstruation: about 5 1/2 tablespoons of flower tops per quart of water. * SAGE in infusion: I 1/2 tablespoons of dried leaves per quart of water. In extreme cases, ask your doctor for medication to alleviatepain.    21. Stop catching colds   As much as possible, avoid coming into close contact with infected persons, especially if they cough or sneeze. A person with a cold is extremely contagious: he or she fills the air with fine particles of saliva or mucous which transport the virus microbe. Even if the person is careful to wipe his nose with tissue or a handkerchief, the microbes will be transported to his hands.And studies have shown that these viruses are transmitted through hand contact. So if you have to shake hands with someone who has a cold, you would better wash soon after!What can you do if you do catch a cold? It is useless to take antibiotics: they have no effect on viruses. However, there are certain substances found in alcohol which help decongest sinuses, that is why a good hot toddy can work wonders. But take care of your liver: a toddy is just as good with a little rum as with a lot.You don’t have to get drunk to get better. You don’t even have to drink it - just sniff some strong alcohol like cognac or brandy and breathe in the fumes.    22. Use heat to cure   Everyone has heard about how good a sauna feels, and of the relaxing effect of a steam bath which bathes you in hot vapor. But there are other heat treatments which are equally beneficial. Heat relaxes the muscles and ligaments. When applied locally, for example, with hot towels, it can ease muscle spasms. It can also reduce arthritic pain. Heat dilates the blood vessels, which in turn activates circulation. Applied to a wound, it can prevent infection by helping white blood corpuscles and fresh oxygen surround the area more quickly.   23. How to combat fatigue   First make sure you are sleeping enough. Is your nutrition sufficient? In general women need at least 1200 calories per day and men 1500. Avoid monotony: a varied diet will be more likely to provide the nutritive elements you need to conserve your energy. The sensation of fatigue may be stress-related, especially when you experience emotional stress. Do you feel tense at work or at home? Lastly, don’t neglect physical exercise. Tired or not, get out in the fresh air every day. Walking is the minimum effort necessary for staying in shape.   24. Protect yourself against cancer  Radical liberals are not a political group, but a kind of very active molecule that is suspected of being one of the causes of cancer. How can you protect yourself? Diet plays an important role here,especially in the absorption of anti-oxidants. The strongest anti-oxidizing agent is Vitamin E, which is found in wheat germ oil and sunflower seeds. Next comes Vitamin C (oranges, grapefruits, lemons, red peppers etc.). Beta carotene also absorbs large amounts of radical liberals.This substance seems to act as a protecting agent against most types of cancer. Where do you find it? In red vegetables (like tomatoes), orange ones (carrots), yellow (squash), and dark green (broccoli). All these are rich in beta carotene. So make them a regular part of your menu!   25. Prevent high blood pressure   Research has shown that people whose diet is rich in potassium (vegetarians for example) are less likely than others to develop high blood pressure. Calcium is also beneficial. Fortunately, potassium and calcium are abundantly present in a large variety of foods. Fruits, vegetables, beans, fish, fowl and lean meats are full of potassium.Calcium is a little more restricted. Foods rich in calcium usually also contain large amounts of sodium and fat, which can increase blood pressure.However, moderate amounts of milk are recommended, as well as yogurt, almonds, bananas, grapes, broccoli, potatoes, beans, tofu and sardines.    26. Iron strong health  Without iron, there would be no hemoglobin in the blood. Hemoglobin gives red corpuscles their color. And it is the hemoglobin that carries oxygen to all parts of the body. If you lack iron, an insufficient supply of oxygen in your hemoglobin will produce sensations of fatigue, headaches and shortness of breath. Men don’t have to worry too much: most men have a reserve of iron stored in their body that could last 3 years ! But women, because of the menstrual cycle, need twice as much iron as men. And the amount is even higher for pregnant women. Vitamin C doubles the amount of iron the body absorbs: so it is a good idea to add a glass of tomato or orange or grapefruit juice to every meal. On the other hand, tea reduces the amount of iron absorbed by 50% and coffee by about 39%.    27. Aging with a healthy body and mind  Did you know that sexual activity can keep you looking good as you age? Studies conducted in Sweden have shown that elderly people who have sexual partners have much more vitality and a better memory than those who do not. So don’t let your golden years deprive you of the pleasures of sex ! Just forget about the obsession of having to “perform” - the final result is less important than the stimulation itself.

       GIRLS BEWARE !!!!!!!   Even lipstick isn't safe  anymore...what's next?  I just came across an article which says that lipsticks are not safe these days, girls need to be aware of this..Brands don't mean everything.   Recently a brand called "Red Earth" decreased their prices from $67 to $9.90. It contained lead in it. Lead is a chemical which causes cancer.    The Brands which contain lead are:    I. CHRISTIAN DIOR  2. LANCOME  3. CLINIQUE  4. Y.S.L  5. ESTEE LAUDER  6. SHISEIDO  7. RED EARTH (Lip Gloss)  8. CHANEL (Lip Conditioner)  9. MARKET AMERICA-MOTNES LIPSTICK.   The higher the lead content, the  greater the chance of causing cancer. After doing a test on lipsticks, it was  found that the Y.S.L. lipstick contained the most amount of lead. Watch out for  those lipsticks which are supposed to stay longer. If your lipstick stays  longer, it is because of the higher content of lead.    Here is the test you can do  yourself:    1. Put some lipstick on your hand.  2. Use a Gold ring to scratch on  the lipstick.  3. If the lipstick color changes  to black then you know the lipstick  contains lead.

      This is based on statistics taken from: 15003 Software professionals from the countries US, China, India, Japan, Pakistan, Mexico, Canada, Australia and UK.  Total Software Companies: 980 The following is based only on statistical information and has nothing to do with astrology, though the following proves that the theory of Sun Sign is true to some extent.   Aries - March 21 - April 19  The software professionals belonging to this sign are hard working and sincere. Though they second the Taureans in hard work, they are intelligent in their approach. They tend to display strong leadership, and their extroverted and assertive natures let them lead the new cycle eagerly. They have humour in their programming style and deepest concern for finishing a project. They are dynamic and active, as befits the beginning of any project cycle. As long as the boss gives them work and good salary, they are happy. If the organization is not doing good, they are the first to know about it and they exit immediately.   Taurus - April 20 - May 20  The most hard working people of all the signs. They are among the strongest Signs when it comes to getting things done because of their reliable persistence in moving toward completion of projects. On the other hand, they can be very stubborn and argumentative. Though they are clumsy at their work, they get it done. They show the deepest respect to their bosses but hate them when they are ordered. They can work just on any platform and language given small amount of learning time. They can withstand failure on any projects but they undergo a little depression. They do not bother how the organization is doing as long as they get good work and good salary.They accommodate changes very easily.   Gemini - May 21 - June 21  These also flirt here. They talk more than what they know and form very bad programmers. They are fascinated with gathering as much information as possible, and their facility as communicators - both written and verbal - arises from this need. They see the problem earlier than any other Sign can. They are adaptable and able to tackle multiple tasks simultaneously, and they know how to reason with people, but they may lack follow-through or seem ungrateful. They tend to use management jargon with young people around them. They feel jealous when somebody in their group knows more and achieves more than them. They get their job done by hook or by crook. They don't mind getting the work done through somebody and once they get it done they claim the title. They show deep respect for people who help them. They change jobs easily and they fare very well in interviews. Geminis cannot be trusted for more than a year. They are very impractical and cannot get along well with practical signs like Aries, Taurus.    Cancer - June 22 - July 22  The most emotional of all signs does posses the management skill more than that of a programmer. They can manage projects and they have appreciation for good software professionals. Though they themselves do not form good software professionals, they motivate/demotivate their fellow people. They can argue on any matter easily and win over it either through a practical approach or emotionally. They play intelligently when given a task. They also, like Gemini, get the work done through colleagues once they know they are not capable. They are very honest and if they can't do a job they will tell you straight in the face. They feel embarrassed when they feel they are unable to do, when a colleague can do it easily. They are also jealous when they see people growing around them. They try hard to be on par with everybody else. They stay for a long time in a company only if they get more respect than what they deserve.   Leo - July 23 - August 23  The creative software professionals. They know how what works and how to get it done in the shortest time. They show their flamboyance in whatever work they do. Though most Leos don't prefer Software, the ones that are in would not like to be in it. They would prefer to be outside where they can show other talents which they posses. Leos may be arrogant or egotistical, but they are good organizers and tend to be popular and even inspiring. Leos tend to be self-centered and more concerned with personal popularity rather than group goals and sharing of ideas. Despite their tendency to patronizingly interfere in others' plans, they are leaders, confident and dignified. Despite their tendency toward bossiness, the natural leadership of people born under Leo and their administrative prowess helps ensure that their projects are successful. As leaders, Leos are decisive and direct, optimistic that they will succeed. Sometimes they exaggerate problems and overreact to stumbling blocks, but generally they are positive and their natural pride and the stubborn streak keeps them from giving up. They can be demanding leaders, but they are also generous. Leos could not be generalized as far as their personal behavior goes. Its up to you to know whether they can be trusted.   Virgo - August 24 - September 22  Virgo, the sharing mind. They let out whatever they know to others. They grow in a organization easily. Virgo brings their skills and talents together for the good of others. Virgo are industrious and efficient when working for a good cause. They are shy and nervous when they want to say something of importance though. They are unable to demonstrate that they know. But they are practical and logical, and they're skilled at seeing all sides of a situation. Virgos tend to be about smaller-scale projects and individuals. They are very good at understanding what people are saying beneath the surface words of their communication. Detailed and precise, people born under Virgo tend to be neat and exacting, but sometimes petty and overly fussy. At the other end of the scale, some Virgos can be sloppy. They are reliable, practical, and diligent, but they can sometimes seem picky or over-critical to people who aren't as discriminating as they are.The don't tend to do well in projects that require many interactions and people involvement. Though there are lot contradictions, the summary is that they can be good at things that are small given a lot of time for implementation. They may worry too much about small details, and they can seem demanding and critical. Their nature and attention to duty can seem like nit-picking pettiness if the people around them don't understand Virgo's desire perfection.   Libra - September 23 - October 22  Best people to work with in large scale project activity. They form the best middle level co-ordinators in projects and bring harmony amongst all. They try to bring justice but can be persuaded by anybody to any side They don't have a clear balance in what they do. But when they are given a schedule you can be sure that a Libran will succeed in that. They are very demanding as far as money goes. Its important that a Libran never gets bored, because if he is so, he is out of everything. He will not do a single task when his mood is off. Libra's intellectual orientation to the world around them makes them skilled at communication and reasoning, and their intelligence combines with their interest in other people to become an intellectual explorer of the people around them. Because their efforts are mentally rather than emotionally motivated, Librans tend to be very judicial; they are good at diplomacy and compromise. Because they are generally reluctant to face confrontation, people born under Libra learn to be persuasive, courteous, and adaptable. But this may also make them seem cold and unemotional or manipulative They are team workers, skilled at cooperative action, but they can also be self-doubting.They are trustworthy for long times as long as they have a good working atmosphere.   Scorpio - October 23 - November 21  The most intuitive software professionals. They do not like to be controlled by others and often tend to be the bosses even if they aren't one. If things go wrong they just quit. If a project doesn't seem to go well and they are in a tight spot they just abscond and never come back. But if they make their mind ( 8% of the Scorpios they tend to be stubborn, refusing to give up when others have long since gotten bored and abandoned a project, and getting things done when no one else thought it possible. They have their own schedule and they work on it. They are not adaptable to group situations and tend to be what they are. They are very secretive in what ever they do. They are highly revengeful and will strike when somebody steps in their way. But most Scorpios are misunderstood. They try to know things around them and are the first to be aware of the new technologies. They enjoy competition and they never settle for something less then best. They are trustworthy as long as they have work and happy and they have somebody in the management to care of them. But when things go bad the Scorpios can never be trusted,better to lay him off right away if you think he is playing bad.   Sagittarius - November 22 - December 21  The learned Software professional. They learn more than what is required in this field and are the most adaptable folks. They really care little for any project plans and know how to get it changed. Their main desire is freedom in whatever they do. Given a free hand, they do best. They are less co-operative in groups and tend to be very pushy. They talk too much before they think and always fail at critical times. They are eager in getting things started and they jump so quickly and if they fail they fail quickly too. They like one-to-one challenges and are driven away by the group when they try blunt talk. They come back to the group after a fight, sulking but needing. They have great love for knowledge. They are trustworthy as long as they think that they are learning in the current organization. They would go away in a flash if they feel that they can learn more elsewhere.   Capricorn - December 22 - January 19  Capricorns are practical and over ambitious. The are down to earth when they want to get things completed. They are practical, realistic, and cautious when they schedule something. They have the highest determination for success, they view each project as a block for their success and are less bothered about the project itself. They can also be rigid and unforgiving when others stand in their way. Their organizational ability combines with their diligence to help them achieve, but they can be narrow-minded and over-critical of people not as ambitious as they are. Capricorns would work hard and hard just for their personal success and not for their satisfaction, which is just the opposite in case of a Taurus. They are dependable and serious, never giving up on their goals. Other people may see their ambition as domineering or a reflection of egotism, but they are patient and purposeful when working toward what they want. Sometimes they may be overly critical, even bossy, but this is due to their strong desire to achieve their goals and not to a desire to be rude.   Aquarius - January 20 - February 18  Hard working, and get things done just for the organization. They are very good at group projects and form good co-ordinators. They can be opinionated, and they work hard to bring their ideas to fruition, stubbornly refusing to give up their causes. They get to know the technology around them and would discuss with the people around. But since they stick to what ever they think is right sometimes this makes them go away from the group and they keep aloof.The are trustworthy and would stick on for a long time given the right kind of people around them.   Pisces - February 19 - March 20  The people who are just meant to work only in group. They are selfless and do it as you require. They most important thing to be put in them is the "focus" since they get out doing something when they lose interest. All signs take advantage of a Pisces for their work because they would like to make use of his abilities. Though they are not intellectuals they are very broad minded and good thinkers. Very trustworthy as long as they are not abused too often bytheir colleagues.

      Do you know that Indian software developers  urlLink make fewer errors  per line of software code compared to highly rated professionals trained in the United States?   This is not the claim of the Indian software fraternity alone. Rather, this is what the 'Task Force Report' said. The report was issued at the beginning of this month by the National Cyber Security Partnership (NCSP) in the United States.   The vulnerabilities in the US government's software applications as well as the in-house application software of some of the largest American corporations from hackers around the world has forced the US government and the US companies to come together to form the NCSP, whose 123-page report talks about Indian superiority when it comes to creating error free software codes.The report points out that "for the last 30 years, India has tried to provide high quality university education in software design to its students.   As a result, India produces programmers who make fewer errors per line of software code than programmers trained in the United States."There had been a long standing demand in the US to remodel the educational system, focusing more on improving the technical and mathematical skills of programmers. The report pointed out that lack of specialisation among software professionals in the US was of primary concern.   Many software developers have only completed short-term courses and they are often entrusted with the task of developing software on which critical infrastructure stand. The concern is that the software knowledge pool is developing too fast for academic courses to keep pace with it.    urlLink Read more...

      This incident happened recently in Delhi and we need to be even more careful everywhere.  A woman went boating one Sunday, taking with her some cans of coke. On Monday she was taken into ICU and on Wednesday she died. The autopsy revealed a certain germ  Leptospira  caused by the can of coke from which she had drunk, not using a glass. A test showed that the can was infected by dried rat urine and hence the disease  Leptospirosis . Rat urine contains toxic and deadly substances. It is highly recommended to wash thoroughly the upper part of soda cans before drinking out of them as they have been stocked in warehouses and transported straight to the shops without being cleaned. A study in Spain showed that the tops of soda cans are more contaminated than public toilets i.e. full of germs and bacteria. So to wash them with water is advised before making any contact with mouth to avoid any kind of fatal accident.  So, always remember to use a glass or a straw !!!

I made many frds,some are still in touch with me, some are not..One special friend was  Parimala Rao , who was called as "Nightingale", as she had a great voice.We always used to ask her to sing for us. Her favourite song was "Tanha Tanha" from the movie "Rangeela".She was my best friend at Holy Angel's HSS at Salem. I tried to trace her out but wasn't successful in any of the attempts...I just thought may be my blog would help me out in this regard,hehe..   This message goes out to her..   Hey  Pari , where are you, yaar? This is Vallu here,hehe, (She often used to call me "Vallu").. I hope u remember this old friend of yours.I tried to contact u many times.Kahin tumhari shaadi tho nahi huyi ??? How are your sisters ?  (She has 4 younger sisters!!!)   Hey,I still remember;Sheetal,U and I were asked to prepare heart-shaped cards for the Fancy-Fete at our school,Sister Angela came to ur class n was happy to see us working,though we wanted to attend Fancy-fete competitions,we then cut a heart-shaped card into 3 pieces,one with each of us and promised that whenever we meet in future,no matter what,we should have that with us as a token of remembrance!!! I still have that small piece of heart with me ...Do u ??? Sheetal was crowned Runnerup II in  Salem Princess  competition then.Hey Sheetal, I always wanted to ask u one thing, par kabhi himmat nahi huyi poonchne ki, hehe, pata nahin, those judges must be blind,hehe,nahi tho tumhari jaisi moti ko runner up-II ka kaise title de diya...hihihihi...

      Back again, from a great weekend at Chennai...many interestin' things happened at home this time, may be bcoz all the members of the family were together after a long long time..dad also took some time off his busy schedule just to spend with us, else he would be either busy in his meetings or in official tours..and moreover my brother was also at home for this weekend.  Saw "Yuva", another borin' movie, none of us liked it;)) I dont know why, I usually don't appreciate Mani Ratnam's movies,the lighting effects won't be that good. I always feel as if i am watchin' an 'Eastman Color' movie, hehehe...his last movie I liked was "Roja".  I wanted to go for shopping with mom this time, but she never got any time off her kitchen work,even though i helped her...she was too busy in preparin' chutneys and pickles for me, huh! every time i go home i carry an empty bag, bcoz i can't escape from mom's chutneys and pickles, i have to load them in my baggage:(  On sunday night,everyone came to see me off at the station.I met Lakshmi with her hubby at the Railway station,she too was boarding the same train to Bangalore.We both were together at RIL.She got married 2 months back and we were meetin' after 8 months, i guess!

I wish I could attend Jagjit Singh's concert tomorrow at Chowdiah Memorial Hall.I have no one to go with :( ..all my friends have their own plans for tomorrow :(

      An angry letter from a young lady made JRD Tata change his rule !!!  Sudha Murthy was livid when a job advertisement posted by a Tata company at the institution where she was completing her post graduation stated that “Lady candidates need not apply”. She dashed off a post card to JRD Tata, protesting against the discrimination. Following this, Mrs Murthy was called for an interview and she became the first female engineer to work on the shop floor at Telco (now Tata Motors). It was the beginning of an association that would change her life in more ways than one.   urlLink Check this link  :-)

      Studyin' for a Certification Exam is not that an easy task.  I hardly get time to prepare for my exam,as i'm into a major project at present, for which,I need to master my project related stuff too, and that has forced my certification study to take the back seat. And I don't want this to happen.   I have been tryin' a lot to get the study materials for my exam since a long time,I did subscribe to hundreds of yahoogroups which provide useful info regardin' these exams. Million thanks to Bhasker- a guy frm Hyderabad, who actually went ahead and couriered the whole of the University materials to my place.That was really a great help from his side. Thanks a ton!!

Many have been benefitted by such programs. I would also like to go in for somethin' of this kind..  So,this goes out to the B'loreans - if anybody has done such personality development program at LANDMARK, then i would definitely like to know more about it !!

      Intensive care ward where patients always died in the same bed and on Sunday morning at 11 a.m., regardless of their medical condition. This puzzled the doctors and some even thought that it had something to do with the supernatural. No one could solve the mystery as to why the deaths took place at 11 AM.   So a world-wide expert team was constituted and they decided to go down to the ward to investigate the cause of the incidents. So on the next Sunday morning few minutes before 11 a.m., all doctors and nurses nervously waited outside the ward to see for themselves what the terrible phenomenon was all about. Some were holding wooden crosses, prayer books and other holy objects to ward off evil........ Just when the clock struck 11... and then.. ... .... .... .... .... .... ....   Santa Singh, the part-time Sunday sweeper, entered the ward and unplugged the life support system & plugged in the vacuum cleaner.  Ha Ha Ha Ho Ho Ho Ho Hi Hi Hi Hi !!!!!

      I reached office a bit early today as I had my QMS trainin' in the mornin' at abt 9.30 am.  The trainin' mainly focussed on the topics like; 1) Software Quality concepts 2) Project Management Methodology 3) SCM and usage of QMS defined templates, and 4) Benefits of formal peer review - Role Play.  Quality Management is a very vast and dry topic. Actually the presenter (a senior employee)made the whole session more interactive by askin' questions to each one of us and that made us stay alert all the time,not lettin' us sleep with our eyes wide open,hehe.I was surprised , i listened right from the start till the end!!! That was amazin'!!

Well, She said, I talk like kids. I dont sound like them,but the way i express is - child-like :(   hmm, my mom's face glows with a smile when i talk to her, she often says that she likes the way i talk, she even says, its so innocent, childish way of expressin' things...and I just smile :D,hehe ....well, m the biggest chatter-box at home.

      hmm, Elisha's b'day party was a blast.I started early from office yesterday, Raji called and asked me to wait at "her" library, well, I said "her" library,bcoz she is more frequent to that particular library at the CMH Road, though she has membership with 4 other libraries in the town,hehe. We then decided to get a b'day gift for Elisha, Ohhh !! God, it was really a difficult task for both of us,Elisha is not that girlish, i mean, she doesn't wear much jewellery or Indian dresses, or else our job would have been easier.Finally decided to get a perfume and some chocolates.Now selectin' a perfume was also a tedious job....    :( that sales-girl went on sprayin' all branded perfumes all over my hands,pheeeewww!!!   Elisha was waitin' for us at "Wanley's", a Chinese  Restaurant,we both were pretty much on time,hehe.She invited about 12 members, but as this place was quite far for others, only 6(including me n Raji) could turn up. So we were total 7 people for the party.It was Elisha's last week at Bangalore, as she has decided to pursue her master degree back home at Goa.Its good to get back to the college environment once again.  Just then Shweta called up to wish her.Actually I,Raji,Elisha and Shweta were all stayin' together at the same PG few months back, that's how we all came to know each other.It was then Raji and me thought of shiftin' to a separate flat,but Elisha continued to stay there.  Charmaine was the next person to join us at the restaurant.Next came her friends,like,Mili,Reshma,Roskin(hope i spelled the name correctly).It was good to meet all of them. I was impressed to meet Charmaine, she is just like me,I mean, most of the time I felt that she mirrored the way I think.It was wonderful to know that there is someone who looks at life the same way as I do, the same enthusiasm about life,career, etc etc..  As Roskin was quite familiar with the food there, so he took the charge of designin' the menu and placin' the order, otherwise also placin' an order when u r in a group is not that an easy thing to do,hehe,none of them wud be sure of what to try and what not.You need to have lots n lots of patience till each one decides on what he / she wants,hehe.So I usually stay away from takin' the lead here,hehe.Clever na???...  Well, it was 10.15 when we all decided to leave, and it was all due to the group of some foreigners(tourists) who were waiting there to get some tables free to occupy, or else we would have continued a little longer. Well, i guess, we moved at the right time or else it would have been even more late to get back home.Mili,Reshma and Roskin got on their bikes,Charmaine had her car parked outside, I and Raji dropped Elisha near her place and came back in an auto. It was really a perfect get-together!!

      This is quite natural for parents to expect things from their children.They try to live their dreams through their children, and unknowingly they even impose certain things on them.In most of the cases,it would be in a career-related issues.I'm sure this scenario is quite common in most of the houses, well, mine too.  Dad called me last night.He told me that he has collected some old question papers for the General Studies Exam for my UPSC.I was dumbfounded. He even said that he would try to get the mathematics optional papers sometime later. Actually he wants me to appear for the UPSC exam next year and become an IAS officer like him. Many a times, I made clear to him that I have no interest in it. But still he wants me to give it a try. I feel so bad when I see him takin' so much pain to get the study materials for me when I ,actually, have not made up my mind about the whole thing.It's good to hear from him that he is pretty much confident about me farin' well in the exam, but I don't think I'm ready for such a thing. I mean, this is not my kind of a profession. I always wanted to be in the IT field and I am. Now making a shift in career would be a great stupidity.Sometimes I feel, I should study and make my dad proud. I know I can acheive. I am confident. You just need to be more focussed and determined, that's it.But,the major issue with me is that I cannot see myself in a Govt. job. Now, how do I change myself?

      hmm, its friday today,hehe. I usually like fridays, as its the last workin' day&nbsp;of the week. I'm so happy that weekend is here again.&nbsp;There are lots n lots of things to be done this weekend. Hope I get them done this time,  atleast ! I have been needlessly&nbsp;procrastinatin' since a long time.  &nbsp;  It was so borin' at the office today. My today's trainin' got cancelled due to some reasons. Right now I'm listenin' to the FM (91- FM RadioCity), will be leavin' home shortly, hehe...&nbsp;I like all the RJs,they&nbsp;are too cool,&nbsp;especially Sunaina Lal, Jonsi and Darius. When I am at home, I usually listen&nbsp;to&nbsp; Radio City 91-FM , it's a good way to keep yourself updated&nbsp;about what's happenin' in the outside world and also its a good pass time. I love "Gabbar Sher", the shayari is usually so funny.&nbsp;

      I have been undergoin' a trainin' for a bankin' product at my workplace. So, today  had an assessment test for what was taught yesterday to the team.(well, its just a trick to make sure whether we slept in the class or not :)) It was a written test of 10 questions. We had just 15 minutes to complete it. But I knew just 9 questions :(( To my surprise, I found myself writin' pages together as I used to do in my college days,hehe.My answers are never in the sequential order as I always start with the easiest question first and would always end up explainin' the invigilator about the order in which I have attempted. Pheeeeewww!! Dont know, when will I improve in this !!!

      Yessss,my TV is haunted!! Last night, I and Raji were watchin' our favourite show on Pogo channel- "Just for laughs", the volume was kinda at the normal level. But all of a sudden the volume increased!! now since Raji was holdin' the remote in her hand, so we thought may be by mistake she must have pressed the volume button. Then later we tried to "mute" as Raji had to attend a call from home, but the volume level remained the same.  Well, i guess there somethin' wrong with my remote,hehe. There is nothin' to be scared of. hehehe!!!

      "Who's calling?" was the answer to the telephone. "Watt." "What's your name, please?" "Watt's my name." "That's what I asked you. What's your name?" "That's what I told you. Watt's my name." A long pause, then from Watt, "Is this James Brown?" "No, this is Knott." "Please tell me your name." "Will Knott." "Why not?" "Huh ! What do you mean by 'Why Knott'?" "Yeah. Why won't you tell me your name?" "But I told you my name." "Didn't you say you will not?" "Not not, Knott, Will Knott." "That's what I mean." "So, you know my name." "Of course not! " "Good. What is yours?" "Watt. Yours?" "Your name!" "Watt's my name." "How the hell do I know your name? I'm asking you." "Look, I've been very patient and I've told you my name. You haven't told me yours yet." "You've been patient, okay! What about me? I've told you my name several times and you haven't told me yours yet." "Of couse not!" "See, you even know my name." "Of couse not!" "Then why do you keep saying 'Of course, Knott'?" "Because I don't."   [PAUSE]  "What is your name?" "See, you know my name." "Of course not!" "Then why do you keep asking 'Watt is your name'?" "To find out your name." "But you already know it." "What?" "Yeah." "Okay, atleast you know my name." "Of couse not!" "Exactly."   NOW THEY'RE AT A POINT WHERE BOTH THINK THE OTHER KNOWS HIS NAME, BUT THEY DON'T KNOW THE OTHER'S NAME.  "Listen ! If I asked you what your name is, what'll be your answer?" "Watt's my name." "Give me only one word." "Watt." "Your name!" "Right." [ PAUSE before it hits him.] "Oh, Wright!" "Yeah." "Why didn't you say it before?" "I told you several times." "But you didn't say 'Wright' before." "I did say right." "Okay, I won't argue any further. Do you know my name?" "I do not." "Well, there you go. Now, we know each other's name." "I do not!" "Good." [ PAUSE before it hits him.] "Oh, Guud!" "Good." "No wonder it took me so long. Is that Dutch?" "No, it's Knott." "Okay. Atleast the names are clear now, Guud." "Yeah, Wright." NOW THEY THINK THEY KNOW EACH OTHER'S NAME AS WELL. Watt do you think ? Do they or do they Knott ??

      A boy was drowning in a river and he shouted for help. A man passing by jumped into the river and saved the boy’s life. As the man was leaving, the boy said "Thank You". The man asked "For what?" The boy replied "For saving my life." The man looked into the boy’s eyes and said, "Son, make sure when you grow up that your life was worth saving."

      Queen Elizabeth, Bush & Musharraf died & went straight to hell.  Queen Elizabeth said "I miss England, I want to call England and see how everybody is doing there.  She called and talked for about 5 minutes, then she asked "Well, devil how much do I owe you????  The devil says "Five million dollars"  She wrote him a cheque and went to sit back on her chair.  Bush was soo jealous, he starts screaming, "My turn! I wanna call the United States, I want to see how everybody is doing there too"  He called and talked for about 2 minutes, then he asked "Well, devil how much do I owe you????  The devil says "Ten million dollars"  With a smug look on his face, he made a cheque and went to sit back on his chair.  Musharraf was even more jealous & starts screaming, "I want to call Pakistan too, I wanna talk to the ministers, to the deputy, I wanna talk to everybody of my Parliment".....  He called Pakistan and he talked for about twenty hours, he talked & talked & talked, then he asked "Well, devil how much do I owe you????  The devil says "Twenty dollars".  Musharraf is stunned & says "Twenty dollars??? Only ??"  The devil says "Well if you make a call from one hell to another hell,it's local".

      I just ran across this poem by Susan Polis Schutz.Thought of postin' it here.   This life is yours Take the power to choose what you want to do and do it well Take the power to love what you want in life and love it honestly Take the power to walk in the forest and be a part of nature Take the power to control your own life No one else can do it for you Nothing is too good for you You deserve the best Take the power to make your life healthy exciting worthwhile and very happy Take the power to reach for your dreams

      Three men were sitting together bragging about how they had given their new wives duties.  The first man had married a woman from  Bangalore , and bragged that he had told his wife she was going to do all the dishes and house cleaning that needed done at their house.He said that it took a couple days but on the third day he came home to a clean house and the dishes were all washed and put away.  The second man had married a woman from  Bihar . He bragged that he had given his wife orders that she was to do all the cleaning, dishes, and the cooking. He told them that the first day he didn't see any results, but the next day it was better. By the third day, his house was clean, the dishes were done, and he had a huge dinner on the table.  The third man had married a girl from  Delhi  . He boasted that he told her that her duties were to keep the house cleaned, dishes washed, lawn mowed, laundry washed and hot meals on the table for every meal. He said the first day he didn't see anything, the second day he didn't see anything, but by the third day most of the swelling had gone down and he could see a little out of his left eye.  Ha Ha Ha !!!

      Atlasttttttt ! my roommate is back from her looooong weekend at home. I really missed her a lot in these 5 days.She was suppose to be back on monday mornin' but as she wasn't keepin' well so she had to extend her stay a little longer. Actually she was searchin' for a  nice  excuse to tell to her PL as she desperately wanted to go home on friday mornin' itself.She was grumlin' the whole week on this. I suggested few reasons, like gettin' engaged, or aunt is dead, or somethin' like doctor's appointment etc etc.. but none of them were that appealin' to her. Pheeeeww!!! And finally, guess what! the cold chocolate milk shake which she had the previous night did its trick,she got a very sore throat on friday mornin'.Her voice was so bad, but it helped her. Without wastin' any more time, our ma'm dialled her PL's number and told him that she wouldnt be in position to attend office.Her PL was a cool guy, he asked her to take rest.hehe.In no time, madam was all set to leave.It seemed as if it was her day.Everythin' was goin' in her favor.I was sooo happy for her.  Hmm, I wish I could get a long break like her.I was just thinkin', how about a cold chocolate milk shake ? hmmmmmm Vallabhi, not a bad idea.hehe.

      Pakisthani music is gettin' much in demand these days. It was Nasrat Fateh Ali Khan who made a mark in the Indian music industry with "Afreen Afreen", then came the 'big hero' Adnan Sami with his "Tera Chehra" and now it's the boy band -"Strings",the duo Faisal Kapadia (Singer) and Bilal Masood (Guitarist singer) have already made their way to the Indian audience.The latest track of 'Strings', " urlLink Na Jaane Kyu " is just too good with excellent lyrics.This composition is  urlLink featured  on the soundtrack of the Hollywood film "Spiderman 2".The  other composition include " urlLink Dhaani " which is a title song and it means "light green color" which symbolizes freshness,as per Bilal. All these tunes are quite hummable.  Now this band is latest on my list. I just fell in love with their music.I have always been a fan of their musical compositions like - "Anjane Kyu", "Durr", etc.Actually I was listenin' to their new track " urlLink Na Jaane Kyu " last night on Channel[V].It made me sing and dance along with it.Just to listen it one more time,i was crazily surfin' other music channels, and luckily it was again aired on MTV, wow, it was my day yesterday,hehe. I guess, I have a huge crush on the guitarist,hehe.For a long time I was under this impression that they were Indians and not Pakis.(They don't sound like Pakisthani singers).It was my brother who 'enlightened' me here and also it was sad to learn that the guitarist is already married,Oh no! how can it be !! hehehe...... Other Pak band I admire is "Fuzon". They too have come up with fantastic music like " urlLink Ankhiyaan ", which makes me dance on their fast beats.  Hey guys, just check out the new  urlLink Pak artists  here.

      Yesterday I started a bit early from office as I had a seminar to attend on the new version of Siebel and that's  urlLink Siebel 7.7 ,at my old office on the airport road.It started by 6 PM, but I was late by 10 mins.One of our employee who recently got certified in this latest version wanted to have a session on the same.  Siebel 7.7 has brought in many new features which looks as if everythin' is so simple, but it has made developer's job more tedious.There are huge chances for complexities to arise as things might get screwed up if not handled carefully.Developer needs to be more cautious here.Performance and look 'n' feel of the software is much more improved.Siebel 7.7 has included the Workflow processes in tools along with the reportin' facility for the Repository EIM Interface tables.This was lackin' in the earlier version.   Later,I had a presentation on Oracle data loadin', spoolin' with respect to Siebel applications.It went on till 8.20 PM. By this,I got a chance to meet all my old colleagues there.   (Somebody suggest a good title for this post,my brain not workin' today,hehe)..

      Friends, its time to pay homage to all the soldiers of Kargil.It's  KARGIL VICTORY day  today- 26th of JULY   Kargil ke sabhi shahidon ko ashrupurit shradhhanajali !!  Sabhi Bharat wasio ko Badhai!!!   A Glorious Victory for India !!!    July 26 , 1999 will go down in the annals of Indian history as a day when the determined Indian forces achieved a glorious victory over the retreating Pakistani army in  Kargil .   It was on this day that the Indian victory over Pakistan was complete. True to its character despite having to pay a heavy price for fighting a war within its territory the Indian forces allowed the Pakistanis, who were pleading almost on their knees, to return across the Line of Control (LoC). It was a gesture which depicted the great Indian tradition of forgiving even the enemy, when it pleads for it. For Pakistan it was another lesson, which it would probably not forget for a long time. It would also put Pakistan to shame, for it chose to torture and kill the Indian prisoners of War (PoWs), rather than handing them over safely as was done by India through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).   Fighting against all odds in the icy heights of Kargil, a remote region in the State of Jammu & Kashmir, the Indian forces ensured that the supreme sacrifice made by their gallant soldiers did not go waste. As the nation stood as a rock behind the men fighting a war forced upon India by Pakistan, the plea from Islamabad to allow a safe passage to the trapped Pakistani soldiers was an ultimate proof about the capabilities of the Indian forces. The successful eviction of Pakistani Armed Forces by the concerted action of the Indian Armed Forces clearly demonstrated that while India remains a votary of peace, it has the will and the capability to fight and win a war, if thrust upon it even at a time, place and terrain chosen by the adversary. The advancing Indian forces left no stone unturned to ensure that not even one Pakistani soldier remained on the Indian soil. With the backing of the Indian Air Force (IAF), the Indian Army achieved a feat which would be hard for any of the armies around the world to match. It was also a milestone in the history of military aviation, as this was the first time that air power was employed with such effectiveness in such a hostile environment. The lessons from Kargil would also be applicable to all the world's Air Forces.    urlLink Read more...

      Looks like I have been neglectin' my blog since a long time.Well,I was a bit busy whole of this week and I guess I would remain so in the comin' weeks too.So no more  scribblin' on the blog,hehe :)) Lots n lots of readin' work have to be done and amid this, I am feelin' too homesick this time :( Haven't been to Chennai since 2-3 months,i guess.I usually make a trip home only when I feel homesick else not.I mostly prefer stayin' back at Bangalore. I talked to mom n dad last night, my mom was like 'when r u comin' here'? Aaaaah, and that made me feel even more homesick...., hmm, I promised her that I would be there by the end of the next week, hope I get lucky enough to get 2 days off.  Last saturday,on my birthday,I and my roommate visited the Shiva temple at the airport road. This was due since a long time,I hardly get time on weekends,though my mom is so much particular about me goin' to the temples. She insists that I should visit this temple every monday, and that's somethin' impossible.I like to spend time at temples,its a place of purity,the most holy place on earth, where ur mind relaxes and makes silent conversation with the God.I too started with my silent prayers, askin' Him to forgive me and bless me with more strength and power to overcome all the obstacles in life.  Later,we both started for the Symphony theatre at the MG Road,and guess what!!! as usual, all the tickets were sold out for Spiderman 2,both of us were so much angry on seein' the 'SOLD OUT' board at the counter.I really can't figure out why this happens with me all the time :( though I was one hour early for the show, I wished Spiderman could throw his web on me n raji and pull both of us inside the movie hall,hehe, atleast that way we could have got a chance to watch the movie even without buyin' tickets! hehe.(too much of imaginations right??) ..Neways, there's always tomorrow.. Now again tomorrow m gonna try my luck.

      Bankin' is such a vast and volatile subject that I hardly get things registered in my mind. And if it stays, it doesnt last long. I tend to forget soon. That's why,I always have to make frequent readin' and re-readin' about the whole bankin'concepts.  Today's trainin' session was too borin', and the topic was 'Interest Processin''- pheeeww!!!..It was soooo much of "interest",hehe.Those who have a sound bankin' knowledge or experience in bankin' product were able to concentrate well, n were able to raise doubts too, whereas my position was like 'a fish out of the pond',hehe.Askin' doubts was of no use, as I didnt get the stuff right at the first place,hehehe :))..Now I have taken all the necessary documents with me home,its time to burn midnight oil:((... Looks like my college days are not over yet! I need to slog and slog and slog all over again.
