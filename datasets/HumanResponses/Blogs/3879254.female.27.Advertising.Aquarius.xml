      Married Woman by Manju Kapoor....is a saga of unspoken desires of today's woman.....her desire to carve a niche for herself both emotionally and professionally..... she&nbsp; aspires for recognition on both the fronts..and this has been clearly sketched by Manju......&nbsp;every girl can almost identify with the main lead... dreams and fantacies of a teenaged girl.... the world she weaves since her childhood.... when endangered by the real hard facts.... how she reacts.... the way she&nbsp; faces the changes and makes emotional adjustments to continue making fool of herself&nbsp; with momentary physical pleasures which&nbsp; were being introduced to her by her husband - a typical of Indian society feature...... Then when she finds solace and&nbsp; contentment in the company of her friend..........&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you actually start believing theway&nbsp; she believes...the way she handles her&nbsp; life...u eventually start living with her......... and that's the&nbsp; MAGIC of Manju.

      The path of a relationship with true love is like a trip together down an old dirt path in the woods - sometimes it'll be beautiful and easy, other times it will be a rough walk with its ups and downs, turns and twists. But when you think you're out of the woods and you look back, you are glad the journey took place, and in all, you are glad you and your special someone took it together. But the journey is not over, you have only just begun. So, don't loose faith; keep on walking. If your love is true, the path you two take will never end. &nbsp; It's not enough to have a dream, unless you're willing to pursue it. It's not enough to know what's right, unless you're strong enough to do it. It's not enough to learn the truth, unless you also learn to live it. It's not enough to reach for love, unless you care enough to give it. Men who are resolved to find a way for themselves will always find opportunities enough; and if they do not find them, they will make them. &nbsp; The worst pain in the world is knowing that he meant everything to you but you meant nothing to him. But, life goes on once you realize your own strength inside of you: the strength to realize that saying goodbye doesn't mean that you don't love the person anymore or that you don't want to keep them in your life. It doesn't mean you're weak. It means that you've the strength to let go and live your life to the fullest because you've learned that life really is good. You are strong and can only be as happy as you choose. &nbsp; Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the one's you did. Explore, dream, discover. &nbsp; There are some things in life that don't go the way you want them to or the way you think they should, but you can't dwell on these because you'll miss out on other opportunites. Don't give up one something just because you don't think things will work, you won't know unless you give it a try. But don't hold onto something that left a long time ago, because sooner or later you'll realize some things just aren't meant to be. &nbsp; Life is not about what I`ve done, what I should`ve done, what I could`ve done... it's about what I can do and what I will do. &nbsp; If you wanna live, make everything happen, but if you wanna play, just dream about it. &nbsp; Hugging closes the door to hate. Kissing opens the door to love. &nbsp; A kiss is not really a good kiss until it consists of 4 elements: honesty, responsibility, respect, and last but not least, love. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      this  could easily be misunderstood by FLATTERY...which it's actually not.... it's making a conducive enviornment  for oneself in sync with others and not at the  cost of one's self respect.
