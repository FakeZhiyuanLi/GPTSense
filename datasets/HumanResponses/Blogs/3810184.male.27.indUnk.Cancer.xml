      You hear from time to time that even encouragers need encouragement.  I have seen the need for that and that sometimes those that seem like they may not need encouragement need it as well.  Sometime we get lost in what we are doing and who we are and then it seems like we are not being paid attention to by ANYONE.  Including Christ.  However, nothing could be further from the truth.  We are His children and he sees us all day long, blessing us in our waking hours and equally blessing us while we are sleeping.  Keep those things in mind always and you can't go wrong.  In the meantime, here are the words to a terrific song by  urlLink  Salvador   .  The song is called  When I Pray .   Well it's another day And I'm thinking about The things I wanna say But my thoughts are like clouds drifting far away Well I admit I doubt sometimes that I'm on Your mind

      I was listening to the radio this evening on my way home from church and this song came on and it spoke volumes to me and I wanted to share it with you.&nbsp; The name of the song is "Thank You" by Ray Boltz.&nbsp; Here are the lyrics:   I dreamed I went to heavenand

      We here all too often that who we sourroudn ourselves with will either make us or brake us.  I have known this for a few years now that if you surround yourself with good people that you are less likely to fall into struggles of the negative type than if you surround yourself with not so great people (I feel that all people are able to be good they just have lacked that influence and want to be good people they just need help getting there).  Recently however, I have come to the realization that it isn't just good people we need to surround ourselves with.&nbsp; We need to surround ourselves also with Godly people.&nbsp; People whose lives are rooted in Christ and developing or furthering their relationship with Him.&nbsp;  The more of the Godly people we surround ourselves with the more we all feed off each others through helping eachother and strengthening eachother in turn furthering our personal relationship with Christ.  I don't feel that&nbsp;we&nbsp;should only&nbsp;associate with those who have this most glorious and amazing of relationships but it should definitely be the majority of whom we do associate regularly with.&nbsp; These are going to be the people that will help keep us on our paths when we need guidance back to or to keep on it.  Just a random thought for us to keep in mind at every step of each day.  Peace, love and chicken grease.

       It has been an interesting week for me as I lose one job and another opportunity presents itself.    &nbsp;  As this has rolled out this week I was reminded of that old addage "Be careful what you wish for you may get it."&nbsp; Then I take a look at Matthew 7:7-8 "(7) Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. (8) For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened. "    &nbsp;  For months I have been praying along with discernment for my calling, for an indication that I should forego what I was doing and proceed to seek a full time youth ministry position.&nbsp; As I was let go from one job a position opened up for a full time youth minister in Austin.&nbsp; Now it is a matter of for lack of a better term some "knee mail" time, and I could certainly use some from anybody taking a look at this if you are so inclined.    &nbsp;  This is going to be the most amazing and exciting time in my life as the events of the next year unfold.&nbsp; Blessing are abundant and on every corner, don't overlook the smallest things that you may think are cool and just "happen".&nbsp; God has a plan for you, a plan to prosper and not to hurt you.    &nbsp;  Stay tuned folks for more excitment, or at least windows to my mind and thoughts therewith.

      Today started off amazing getting a chance to do some mission work at Lord of the Streets, and getting to come back and worship at my home church.&nbsp; The day progressed as Sunday's do and me getting ready to have a most awesome speaker from  urlLink Voice of The martyrs . &nbsp; Here is where I stumbled tremendously.&nbsp; I worked on this getting the speaker here for a few months and put my time in, probably could have done more, and wanted this to be a huge event.&nbsp; It was not even half the size I wanted it to be.&nbsp; I lost site of the reason I was doing this.&nbsp; I wanted to help spread the word of Christ and raise awareness for those in countries where merely professing your belief in Christ is enough to have you killed at worst and at best means being taken to jail and beaten. &nbsp; Pride got in my way, it took four people to help me hear that it isn't about what I was doing and who was here that it would work out in God's will and in His manner, not mine. &nbsp; I let my pride reach into me deeply and affect the way I behaved, my manners, my mannerisms, my thoughts...my entire being be consumed by this.&nbsp; This hurts me tremendously to look back and see the way I acted.&nbsp; It was not right it was not me, it was Satan seeing the strongest opportunity he had to crush what I was trying to do.&nbsp; There is no better time for him to jump in and do what he does best, than when we are doing something that he totally hates with every ounce of his being, and he will do anything he can to stop the spread of the Gospel and the life that comes along with it.&nbsp; He came very close to succeeding but did not quite manage to, only because of the love and the prayers that were being said and given to me that things would work for the Glory of Christ Jesus MY LORD AND MY SAVIOR!! &nbsp; However, some tremendous good is going to come of that pride rearing it's most ugly head.&nbsp; I am greatly humbled by things done, byt things said, and by things seen this evening. &nbsp; So with that all being said I really need to take some time.&nbsp; Ask for my forgiveness for the way I acted, praise God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and thank Him for every last minute I have had today.&nbsp; I am off to spend my time talking and praying and in the mean time I exhort to you to take a look at Hebrews 13:1-4.&nbsp; Read it. Re-read it, and think about it.&nbsp; Take it to heart.&nbsp; It is not a light thing to be a Christian it is not an easy thing and it hurts at times but with some of that hurt comes the most joyful thing you or I will ever know.&nbsp; For he has plans to propser us and not to hurt us. &nbsp; Know that I am praying for YOU.

      It is amazing the ways that we are able to find encouragment or that we are encouraged.  It can be the most simple of things that encourages us, such as watching an ant move something that it seemignyl should not be able to move, watching a baby start walking, watching one of those underdog movies like  Rudy .  The past few months I have been working on getting a guest speaker from  urlLink  Voice of the Martyrs   to come and speak on Love and Joy as well as procuring two amazing musicians,  urlLink Trent Walton  and Alex Dauphin.  The event is fast approaching on the 18th and I have never taken on a project such as this before so I have been praying that it would come together well and beyond that would simply work to get across the message that God is intending to get across.  At any rate, as the date gets closer I have been mildly concerned with how it will come off and who all might show up.  I got a call today from the Youth Minister of St. Thomas Episcopal Church in Houston saying that he will be coming and bringing 10-15 people.  That was enough to encourage me that this will work much to my delight and the delight of everyone listening and participating.  On another event, the Episco-Disco in October, I was told that the DJ for it backed out which allowed for my friend Roy to get his company in  urlLink (TMAC Sound) a position to take care of it.  I got an email from Ewart Jones (Diocese of Texas Youth Missioner) saying that he trusted my judgment and to see what I could do to make it happen.  So the little things (and there are many more mostly from other people not events) that seem to keep popping up and just totally keep me going.  If you happen to get it in your thoughts pray for those serving on the Mission Trip to Honduras this coming week.  So with that, it has been a little long I will leave you with this bit of scripture.  "Such a large crowd of witnesses is all around us! So we must get rid of everything that slows us down, especially the sin that just won't let go. And we must be determined to run the race that is ahead of us."  Hebrews 12:1 (CEV)

      So we have completed yet another 4th of July Holiday here in the United States.  I had a most wonderful and blessed day on Sunday that started out serving breakfast to homeless people of Downtown Houston.  I didn't know how that would turn out because there was not a breakfast serving crew established for Sunday so I asked as many people as I thought would be willing to be up and working at 6:30am to help.  As it turned out I got more help to serve breakfasts than I realized.  That's how the day started, from there I went to a church that has a reputation for being somewhat stodgy and uptight, to share worship with a most amazing and blessed person.  What I found in the service was much different than what I anticipated and was truly a wonderful service.  Great worship, great music, a wonderful liturgy, and even better I had a tremendously wonderful person sitting next to me on my right.  This only brings me to about 10am so a busy first part.  From there it was on to watch the Astros game (if you could call it that).  It wasn't great baseball from an Astro's fan point of view but from the view of loving baseball, this was truly an amazing game.  What a way to spend the 4th of July, watching America's pass-time.  To top that off as you walked into Minute Maid Park there were tables set up to write post cards to the troops overseas...all paid for by Major League Baseball (at least they did something right this year).  Let me backtrack to Saturday night when I was fortunate enough to provide the sound for the Humble Area Chamber of Commerce Independence Day Celebration.  Back to Sunday and the 4th.  The firwork celebration for Humble was amazing to see that many people coming together with no agendas other than to enjoy a firework display.  It was amazing to watch btu even more amazing was watching all the families up and down the street, literally I think all the families, letting off firewrosk together in an almost coordinated neighborhood firework display.  Not too many places you are able to see it.  That ended the weekend most spectacularly.  So pointless rambling which is not uncommon for those who know me well, but again a chance to see the kind of things that run through my mind.  "Blessed is he whose faith is in the Lord" - Psalm 40

      As you read through all this, it may seem jumbled, confused, tinged with an air of excitement.  There are reasons for all of that if it comes across.  This will kind of be a walk with me as I go through my discernment process on a path I pray leads me to seminary and ordination as a minister in the Episcopal church.  It will also be a run with me as I hopefully turn into a much better and stronger youth minister.  So follow along, join me on this wild and crazy journey.  If nothing else it will be exciting and comicle.  "I waited patiently for the Lord, he inclined and heard my cry.  He lifted me up out of the pit out of the mirey clay..."            - Psalm 40:1-2

      Well I guess I made my little spot on this vast highway we call the internet.  This is my first attempt at anything like this and will let you in on my life a little (or a lot) so bear with me as I work on it and bring it up to what should be some interesting things thoughts and musing that run through my head.  Yes, surprisingly I have a few of those thought thingies from time to time.  In the mean time keep two scripture verses in mind.  James 1:2 and Hebrews 13:2  May the Lord bless you and keep you this day and always.
