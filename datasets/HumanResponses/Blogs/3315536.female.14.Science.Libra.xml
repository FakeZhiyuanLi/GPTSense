      Life sucks then you die  This is true and my life is livening proof.  I will start you off with my a$$ hole of a father >:P I hate people who think I'm a horrible person for hateing my father but they don't and can't understand. My 'father' was a drunken alcoholic b@stirred who doesn’t care about anyone but himself and I finally get away from him at the age of 7(I fought so I wouldn't haft to visit him on the weekends anymore!)And he begs for me to give him a second chance and of cores a 7 year old wants a dad. He said he had changed he hadn’t and once again I refused to see him. Then he begged me again and finally with everyone pushing me to give him another chance I did long story short he was STILL a pompous a$$. Anyways I finally said no more chances! I don't care what people say I'm never seeing him again(he also if you couldn't guess beat my mom when they where still together-That was the thing that ticked me of the most)I don't have a father in my opinion because a father or a mother is someone who cares about there child/children. Who will love and respect them and there dreams no matter what unless its harmful. but I haft to speak to him, grit my teeth and try to be nice for the child support checks because like I said before my mom got laid off and then more bad things happen but I'll write about that latter... -bye  Loggin out

      -__- *sighs* Hellow. Welcome to the depressing life of Rin Sevlow... I am a 14 year old dyslexic (So excuse my spelling errors-IF YOU DON'T Like it then you don't haft to read it-duh) child who just needs to get some things on paper-computer. At least some things I will never be able to tell every thing some things will haft to be trapped inside me forever. But if I don't let some things out soon I fear I will explode! Some of my hobbies are Graphite art discluding people (unless you count mangas) I'm a 1st degree black belt in Tea-Kwon-Do(Which I had to give up when my mom got lade off-I miss it so much-STUPID BUSH)designing web pages, studding Canines, studding Stem cell and hanging out with my great friends. Those are some good parts in my life... I will get in to the other things latter but I should be writing my report about Fritz's Law which is quite interesting so I'm going to go do some more research now. Logging out

      This is the paper I was writeing yesterday have fun   Fritz’s Law   Fritz’s Law is a proposed ordinance that states that any dog over thirty pounds is a hazard and should be dealt with accordingly. Fritz’s law will make dog owners that own dogs over 30 pounds register their pets as “potentially dangerous.” The owner would be required to have a $250,000 surety bond payable to anyone who might potentially be injured by the dog, have a $250,000 homeowner’s policy, keep the dog in a proper enclosure, keep it muzzled and leashed when outside the enclosure, have an identifying microchip embedded in the dog, and pay additional yearly registration fees. Failure to meet these requirements would mean the dog could be taken away and even put down. I believe this is wrong. Most people wouldn’t be able to keep their best and most loyal friend(s) if this proposed ordinance is passed.  In the United States, it is estimated that between 2 and 3 million dog bites are reported every year. But there are lots of dogs that do not attack humans in the U.S.A., and of the 2-3 million reported, some of these dogs aren’t even over 30 pounds. The list of top breeds involved in both bites and fatalities changes from year to year, depending on the popularity of the breed. Although genetics does play some part in determining whether a dog will bite, factors such as whether the dog is spayed or neutered, trained, or socialized, play as much or even more of a role in the level of aggression present in a dog. For example, non-neutered dogs are up to three times as likely to bite than those animals that are spayed or neutered. In addition, unleashed dogs, that irresponsible owners just let roam around as they please, are more likely to bite than others.  I have asked other owners, and many say that, at times, their smaller dogs can more vicious and snappish than the larger dogs. I have also heard stories, and have seen it for myself, from my sister’s small Shiba Inu, Tobi, who is somewhat dog aggressive. She also lives with 3 large dogs that would never attack another dog or human.   Any dog can be “potentially dangerous,” and it could be said that any animal, any pet, can be dangerous. I have more bites and scratches from my cat than from any of my dogs. In fact, I had a bunny that bit me a few times. You can’t just claim one species of animal over a certain weight is potentially dangerous and might possibility hurt someone. There are many responsible owners with well-socialized animals that are no danger to anyone, and they should not have to pay for expensive liability insurance and a dangerous dog registration fee every year to own a pet.  From the research I have done, it is not the dogs that are to blame, it’s the irresponsible owners who are too lazy and don’t care enough to properly take care of their pet. Simple things like a puppy obedience class, and using a leash to walk your dog in public, are both great ways to socialize a dog, and can stop him/her from ever becoming a biter. Spaying and neutering is a good idea, and keeping your dog from running around unsupervised to harass others is essential. We do not need new laws to protect the public from dog attacks, especially one like this that makes no sense. We have enough laws concerning dangerous dogs; these laws just need to be enforced.
