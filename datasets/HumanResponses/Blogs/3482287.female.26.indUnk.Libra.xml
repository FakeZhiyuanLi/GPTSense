      Someone recently asked me "what really gets you off?"  - well that's obvious I thought .. but then it hit me if I could have one last sexual experience for my entire lifetime what would that experience be?  And then wouldn't that experience truly be what would get me off?  Which got me to thinking if I never figure out the things I want to try - how will I ever know to try them?  Logically I need to document these grand ideas, these whimsies, these sordid fantasies and tantalizing details.  And that is what brought me here today.  For my delightful inspiration I have decided to ideally explore three ideas ... so with baited breath and anxious pen (in no order of importance of course!):  1) What has been my best/most intense sexual experience to date?  Why and could that experience ever be recreated? 2) What is my one fantasy of longing that I know I could someday make a reality? 3) If I could have one last sexual experience, no realities holding me back (but of course logic playing a role) what would that experience be?  On our next encounter I shall attempt to flesh out some serious debate on question #1.  Although I know what experience will win, there are elements of others I feel I need to discuss and yes ultimately take the time to savor over again...  Till we meet again. XOXO

      It seems I always have brilliant thoughts and no one to share them with.... Perhaps this is the way for me to go.  It is official I am addicted to MSN, lavalife and coffee.  I lack real physical human contact and fear becoming a hermit.  Why you ask?  If I knew I obviously wouldn't seek the eyes of strangers reading my words and thoughts.  I find that at times I seek sympathy from my now married friends, and yet at other points I find myself celebrating my aloneness.  But how much self love is too much?

      Well it appears that Canada did its best to muddle through the non-sense of yesterdays election .. and an exciting time is sure to be ahead of us.  But enough about politics .. because at least for now we are free of become part of the USA.  Another sigh of relief because I think I am finally coming to the conclusion that somethings gotta give ... and that something can't be a complete mental and physical break down.  I have gone non-stop for three years and it's time that I have some fun again.  MMMmmm and what delicious fun it will be.  I have no fears, because I know that all of the yummy fantasies I have dreamt up are soon to come true.  It's amazing when you meet your sexual match.  And it's even more amazing when they have the potential to be your emotional and intellectual match as well.  Tonight I am going to sit down with my babblings and flesh out some concrete ideas about what I want to write about and explore.  As you can tell I have been distracted lately .. mind you it's been worth it .. but its time to get back to my goals.  I hope that the boy ;-) will be part of the process and understand when I do have to pull back at times to get things accomplished.  So tomorrow my pretties its back to our roots, back to the exploration and examination of life, sex and web cams.    XO

      Today is election day in Canada.  I hope that all those who could did vote.  On the way to the ballot box I had a crazy thought ... with all the insane reality TV shows that have a voting process why can't we run our government the same way?    Better yet can I have my own personal panel of judges and tribunal councils that determine my next moves?  That way when I am faced with a life changing event it's not me that has to take the blame!  For instance should I keep both my jobs - the panel discusses this ... tense music.. drum roll and then their answer "well your performance in both has been stunning, but the audience has spoken, you must leave the one job, thank you bye-bye".  Ahhh wouldn't that be grand!  In my dream world I wouldn't have to be working right now.  I could be fully engrossed in my documentary while still studying part time.  I could go where ever I needed to get the doc made, and my Alistair would come with me ...  But in reality I know I will continue this insane break neck work schedule ... scatter my studying between jobs, hope that I have a few hours left in the week to sleep, work on the doc and see the boy ...  *sigh* at some point somethings gotta give.

      How can you explain passion?  Is it a quality a person can possess or an action they exhibit, or perhaps a feeling that overwhelms you?  The warm fuzzy bunnies that were hopping in the field can only distract for so long.  Eventually you become overwhelmed by your feelings (physically and mentally) and it happens.  No worries and certainly no regrets.  This weekend I saw passion, I felt passion and for the first time in forever I had passion touch me, caress me, savour me ...  Every touch more intense, every emotion swirling closer to love.  Is it love, of course, it is budding deep in my heart and flowing over in my mind.  But it was lust too, fun, playful, mind blowing.  So right and so comfortable on every level.    On the way home we found a playing card ... the ace of hearts ...  turns out the cards are speaking of our destiny.  Ace of hearts: The home, love, friendship, joy the start of a romance.  When it feels this good it can't be wrong.

      I am sitting here eating cherries ... giggling for many reasons.  Of course the whole connotation of a cherry brings up numerous chuckles.  But what makes me giggle even more is the idea that everything I have eaten today was so sensuously tactile.    My sushi lunch required the licking of fingers.  My cherries the constant connection with my fingers to my mouth.  How erotically tangible on so many levels.  What is more intimate then the meeting of lips and hands.  The gentle sucking of a finger tip.  The tingling while tracing someone's lips softly with your fingers.  Lips meeting and fingers teasing ... sigh.

      It's amazing how beginning to fall in love can consume every ounce of your existence...  I have literally been monopolized by overwhelming feelings of joy and bliss.  Why yes I am love sick...  This has allowed me to waste vast amounts of time on the internet at work.  I found some great sites, one that I will share.     urlLink      It's also amazing that I started on this journey with no intention of my heart becoming involved.  It was merely a way to explore and gain fodder for my documentary.  And to my surprise and great happiness it has become so much more.  Will this affect my original ideas?  Not at all, if anything I have a greater focus now.  So I guess I have two official announcements ... one is that the gods and goddesses must be smiling cause I am falling in love.  And secondly, the documentary is a go.  With a new focus and new goal.  To liberate and celebrate the world web cam fun ... more details to come.  Kisses my pretties! XO

      I can't figure out what has made me so nauseous right now ... was it the soup I had for lunch, the milk in my tea, or just overwhelming joy?  It could also be my complete boredom and lack of initiative to work on anything that may require thought.  The again if I concentrate on something it makes me feel like I need to puke even more.  Once this feeling has past I will post more.  Fingers crossed that it will pass without incident.

      Never fear I am always around!  I will never let you down!  I admit I have been distracted, and what a wonderful distraction is has proven to be!  I am amazed at how much a person can crawl into my head and consume my thoughts.   smitten  adj 1: (used in combination) affected by something overwhelming; "conscience-smitten"; "awe-struck" [syn: stricken, struck] 2: marked by foolish or unreasoning fondness; "she was crazy about him"; "gaga over the rock group's new album"; "he was infatuated with her" [syn: crazy, dotty, gaga, enamored, infatuated, in love, soft on(p), taken with(p)]   In my defense though, I don't think that my emotions are that foolish.    I have been continuing my research on many of the questions I have posed so far ... and you will soon see the fruits of my labours.  Tomorrow there will be more ~ I promise!  XOXO

        You make me want to walk head first blindly into the unknown. Giving up all of my sureties and barriers to hold you even for one fleeting moment. To know I have touched your heart, felt your soul, reached your mind. I am not afraid anymore you have me.

      Cause we all just wanna be pornin' around!  Although only 1.5% of internet websites contain adult content, they make up 66% of all online content.  Adult website revenues in 2001 had grown into a US$2.5 billion industry.  Online perusers of porn surf about 14 hours a week - which is slightly higher then the average net-surfer.  Adult online visitors spend an average of $17 more a month on the web then the average online consumer.  Adult Video News reports that the adult entertainment industry made $14 billion dollars in 2002-03.  AT&T Broadband has 10 million adult entertainment subscribers.   Wow .... you do the math ....  XOXO

      Think about how many people you have 'met' over the internet ...  people from every corner of the world that you would never encounter in your everyday real life.  Think about the acquaintances, friendships, and even relationships you have developed with essentially strangers.    Now think about my previous discussion on web cams and inhibitions ... how many e-one-night-stands have you had?  How have they differed from your actual one night stands?    I am going to guess that the guilt factor was a lot less in the virtual situation .... at least that is my experience.  From my web encounters I think that virtual relationships do in a sense mock real relationships ...  well ok maybe not mock but alter our perceptions of the complexity of real relationships.  Online everything is easier ... talk comes naturally, nothing gets held back, if you don't want to talk you just log off, you can lie through your teeth and the other person never really needs to know.    And that's my problem with virtual relationships ... how do you know the person on the other end of your computer is sincere?  I guess that comes with how serious you want to get with that person.  Do you want just a one time e-encounter, or do you want to get to know that person?    So virtual relationships are really no different then taking a stranger home with you for some quick fun.  I prefer meeting people over MSN, I find I can feel them out before I take the next step and attempt to talk to them on the phone .. after that if I decide to meet them, I feel that my online chats have allowed me to get a better sense of the person.    And as for my e-encounters ... how much safer can a girl be?  I enjoy the shows and if the mood hits me I show too.  And I never have to worry about catching anything ... forcing myself to talk to the person again or even the morning after guilt.  I think that virtual relationships are the new courting process.  In a world where we are so paranoid to make a connection, the internet allows us to form bonds before we meet, instead of meeting and getting hurt because we were clueless.    I hope that the bond I am currently forming turns into more.  I never would have met this person if it wasn't for the internet.  And to be honest would never have the nerve in person to do or say the things I have.  I honestly believe you can meet a kindred soul over the internet.  The web opens your heart to the world .. because lets face it your soul mate is probably not waiting for you in your own backyard....  Until Tomorrow, XOXO

      Stupid people ... some days I only come across a few and my life moves along without too much frustration.  But days like today where I encounter hundreds I am ready to get up on the water tower with my gun and start eliminating them!  It started when I was on the phone - clearly on the phone with a client - and someone leans over my desk right in my face and doesn't even say excuse me - just says got the key [for the washroom].    Then my co-workers have all decided that apparently I am the only one that can answer any questions ... especially when I am trying to cram in a 20 minute lunch to eat soup that I had been trying to heat up for the last half hour because people will NOT leave me alone.    Then of course their is the assumption by the general public that because I sit at the front desk I control everything and everyone in the building and should be able to get them what they want when they want it ....    I don't get paid enough to deal with this ... I don't think I could ever get paid enough to deal with this.  My only saving grace today is that I will be whisked away to Ikea later.  And that my sweetie sends me happy thoughts that warm my heart and make me smile.   Thank you baby for giving me something to look forward to.   Tomorrow I will get back on topic.  I am going to do some research and look at some numbers and prove to you once and for all that we are in fact a porn obsessed nation!

      Once again this message is for you ...  I know I will dream about every wish and desire we have shared ...    I can't shake you from my head, and I don't want to. You have crawled into my heart, and I plan to keep you there. You are helping me see the meaning in love songs, and the joy of happy endings. I know I am falling, that's not what I am afraid of. What scares me is that it feels so good.

      As previous discussed I wondered if maybe lust and love are the same emotions just with different degrees of intensity?  I decided long ago that lust is sufficient grounds for a sexual encounter.  I have also decided that lust can end before turning into love.  What I never considered is how lust can develop into love...  When you first meet someone and there is the undeniable attraction clearly that is lust, as you begin to explore the person, learn about them, and emotions grow stronger you become smitten.  If after you have explored the feelings of being smitten and infatuated and want to get to know the person even more I think this is where love starts to develop.  The key is to know when to decipher smitten from the beginnings of love - if this is even possible.  I have been smitten many times, but the intrigue wears off when I have had to work at maintaining an interest.  However (as is currently unfolding) if once smitten I continue to be intrigued then there is the possibility that lust and infatuation will develop into so much more.  So I guess in a sense I am agreeing with what Ska Boy said.  That lust and love  are of the  same emotion.  However they are not the same emotion.  It's the ability to recognize the difference and admit when one starts and the other ends that makes us better at justifying our actions.  The funny thing is when I just lust for someone I have no problem exploring an encounter.  But if I know there is a chance for something more I tend to hold off on that encounter ... I wonder why that is?  Till the next time! XOXO     My heart is growing every moment, my mind exploring every option, I am enjoying the ride.

      I wrote this for you,  you  know who you are ... I needed to share it with you - but was afraid that it might scare you.  I am so fearful that this has all been a game to you ...  I so hope it hasn't .     I guess it's better left unspoken. As I ramble on about my fears and dreams and levels of emotions. I twist and I squirm under this new found corner of my mind - and it screams out at me ... and then cowers waiting for it to all crumble down. And I try too see what it is you feel, and I try to read your inner thoughts.  (Can we reach that level where my heart can come gushing out in long poetic phrases about the future?)  But I still can't think of forever. So I shall wait - wishing I can freeze this time where I entice you. Entice you -  do I ? Is it possible for  me  to be enthralling, amusing, wanted?  Please mind don't let me screw up. Please heart, please let me open up. I know I  do  want to feel it this time.

      Back to reality for a bit.  Apparently I didn't have any more intelligent thoughts yesterday!  Today lets discuss part 2 of Inhibitions ... focusing on the web cam and where we draw the line.  Is there really a sense of safety behind a key board and wires that can push someone to do things that they would never consider in person?  In my experience yes.  Completely shy, reserved people have ventured into exhibitionism and its many realms because of the safety that the internet creates.  For some nudity on web cam seems like nothing, but ask them to disrobe in person and that's a whole other inhibition to cross.  Most when asked have explained that yes being watched by that stranger in itself becomes a turn on and then eventually an addiction.  A simple university student suddenly becomes an alluring sex kitten, your average IT guy becomes a yummy porn star...  The question is where do we start to draw the line if we even do at all.  Does the web completely erase our inhibitions because we believe we are behind closed doors?  Experience says that much like anything else in life, once you take step one, step two seems even easier to move into.  I could move from flashing some flesh, to being topless, to eventually pleasing myself on camera naturally and unreserved over the internet.  And my reasoning behind this may be as simple as why not?  Is it any different then dating someone in person?  Isn't this one of the safest ways to express my sexual energy?  Think about it, even when inhibitions are erased because of the safety of the internet, most participants are still involved in a safe natural experience.  There is no physical contact - so no worries of diseases.  You never have to release your name - so no one really needs to know who you are ... In a sense its starting taking the seediness out of one night stands.  And in some cases a sexual web relationship can and has translated into a meaningful personal 'real' life relationship.    Perhaps the internet has allowed us to drop our inhibitions thereby allowing ourselves to be more honest and open about our sexuality and emotions.  My only concern is for those who don't know where to draw their line, and feeling guilty for behaviors they are still overly inhibited about.  It's easy to get caught up in the moment and baring more of yourself then you intended.  I guess in a sense at least on web cam there hasn't been any physical contact.  However at the same time, I hope that when people do venture into the world of internet show and tell they know what they are getting into, don't get too wrapped up in the moment and always know where they have drawn their lines.  In reality that has less to do with inhibitions and more to do with your comfort level...  As always your thoughts are welcomed.  Until tomorrow ~ XOXO

      Can one have a pure mind and still be a dirty girl?  I grapple with this everyday ...  My actions and intentions are always pure.  I am a good person who acts on the premise that I will better others lives.  I never act with malicious or vicious intent ... so that makes me pure in that sense.  But when the lights are dimmed and I am with someone I have a connection with ~ things just aren't so pure.  In case it isn't already obvious I am a dirty girl by heart.  Encounters should be fun, exploratory, adventurous, and yes dirty!  If both parties are consenting and have honest communication then let the games begin.  And in a sense purity comes from being honest with yourself and others.  Denying your need to explore muddies the waters of purity.  One very passionate person shared with me their view on purity "I think to be completely pure is to completely know oneself... no matter what you may say or do".  I like that thought because it means that I am pure in every aspect of my life.  One definition of purity that I really like is this:   Purity - Freedom from sin or guilt; innocence;    I do not believe in sin so I am free from that.  I am free from guilt because I never regret an action that I have completed in honesty and openness .. but innocence - pffft not me!

      So I will post a few poems (of sorts).  First I want to thank everyone for your comments ~ your thoughts impress me and make me consider other views...  So until the temperature dips here are some musings of sorts ....    Naked  I stand before you, a living statue. My soul baring itself with every breath. As my breasts heave, and my skin crawls, you have chiseled me into your passion.   NIGHTMARES where the beast steals my only attempt at innocence and forces me to be.  Finding the map is pointless.  So look at me and think.  Nothing can be solved with these bitter black tears falling.    Untitled  Things slip through your head and then your hands.   Something you wanted to grasp for one split second, seems possible,  then walks away;  while you stand amazed, amused and once again confused.   When everything seems so erotic, so tangible,  right there in front of your face,  when they're gone, you'll suffer your own stupidity.  that's it for today folks.  Let's pray for the rain.  XOXO  PS thank you to the person who has been keeping me smiling for the last few days, I can't want for it all to come into place ....

      I had mentioned in an earlier post that there was an article in the Toronto Star that got my hair up.  To be honest it down-right p!ssed me off.  I would post a direct link but it doesn't work ... go to the Toronto Star site and look for the article "Stiff Competition".   The author brings up the idea that because guys watch porn it leaves their girlfriends in the dust because porn creates a false image of woman.  Well sure not all woman are as beautiful (or in many cases fake) as the buxom blonde porn starlet ~ but isn't that the point of porn?  It's a form of VISUAL stimulation ~ not a reality show.  She claims that most woman are perturbed and even disgusted that their partners view porn.  Perhaps its because these women feel insufficient or lack a sexual confidence...  and this has nothing to do with porn.  Apparently any male who partakes regularly in internet porn viewing is addicted and needs to seek help!  Wow good thing I am a professional counselor I will have clients galore needing help for this so called addiction.  And women on college campuses are complaining more and more that they can't compete with porn.  Hell who can!  It's porn!  That's like taking a drive on the 401 and then suddenly realizing I can't compete with a movie like say The Fast and the Furious and deciding that anyone who watched that movie is addicted to fast cars and chases....  But what really made me cringe was this comment "you don't need to be a feminist to understand that the purpose of all porn in mainly to titillate and satiate men, with a solid subtext of power and control, of male dominance and denigration of women".  Gee, were can I begin with that.  A) 99% of women in porn make double to ten times as much as the men, B) any respectable adult film production company runs their facilities comparable to those in the 'legitimate' film industry; C) if you don't like it shut the damn thing off.  If you aren't comfortable with telling your partner that you aren't happy with something they do - don't blame porn, blame yourself for not being able to be open...  GRAR I am so angry I can't even focus my thoughts.  Oh yes and the comment that women in porn are not equal challenging or independent.. I guess all of those women who are multi-millionaires because of the adult entertainment careers don't count.  This is like accusing a Hollywood starlet of the same because she takes roles where she plays the underdog.  When will people realize that porn has existed since the creation of sexuality.  And as long as all parties involved are consenting then there are no reasons to raise a fuss.  I say bring on the porn, let me enjoy and if you don't like it you don't have to watch....   XOXO

      After three hours sleep I have come to the conclusion that certain choices I make are pleasantly self destructive.  And selfishly I don't care that I am exhausted and in pain .. however I know my work will suffer.    My horoscope was great today... this marks the beginning of great achievements for me and many of my dreams will be coming true.  All I really hope that means is that I will finally find someone to share with ... when it comes right down to it that's what I really want.  Bah .. too mushy for a Monday or any day.  Ironically my other horoscope mimics many of my thoughts that I have written so far:  It's safe to say that you'll be a bit unconventional in your personal relationships. Is that a bad thing? Hmmm.. is this just confirmation that perhaps my sudden eccentric behaviours are justified.  I will seek justification for them anywhere.  I agree completely with a fellow MSN'rs comment that seeing someone online for the first time and watching them undress, touch themselves - its such an amazing rush, so addictive.  But I worry that this thrill will wear off leading to more extreme situations.  The only compensation is that over the safety of the web cam we never have to reveal our true identities.  No one needs to get inside our pysche or understand who we are - its just instant gratification and then thanks see you later.  Which leads me to this: has the web cam recreated the one night stand?  I wrote this at 4 am last .. I think the person knows who they are ... if not it doesn't matter its just words on paper (and well now the screen).  I've tried to sleep but its no use thoughts of you keep curling through my head confusing me and taunting me.  I have shown you so much of me already, but none of it is really me.  Once (if ever) you look past the curves of my naked flesh will you see the brilliance and potential that I possess - will you see the real me?  The whole idea of web cams as the new one stand leaves me feeling as conflicted and confused as real life one night stands... Although fun at the time - I fear it will become a self destructive addiction.  That is why I feel the need more and more to find the one...  Later today once I clear the paperwork from my desk I will delve into the whole web cam one night stand idea, as usual I have many ideas!  XO  PS nothing makes the morning better then Jim Morrison asking "come on now touch me babe can't you see that I am not afraid..."

      The cold has subsided enough to make somewhat intelligent thought ... however it's Sunday and I choose to rest.  I shall make a list of things to do or rather thoughts to tackle this week (or in following weeks) instead...     - what was with that article in The Star?! - new adventures with kindered souls: each new encounter brings you one more first - web cams and the new one night stand - longing for something you can never have in reality and what that does to ones expectations - inhibitions part 2 - where do you draw the line - lust vs. love part 2 - when longing becomes a factor - exploring voyeurism on a new level: the intellectual side - show and tell: is it safe in this new digital world?    Well folks .. thats it for today ... stay happy have fun and live life!    XOXO

      Well it's official ... I woke up feeling worse today then I did yesterday ...  So if this post is nothing but incoherent babbling I plead the snot made me do it.  During one of my many MSN conversations a friend proposed the idea that someone can start out just as a viewer but become just as addicted to showing.  I laughed this off but later realized in many ways this is probably true.  Exhibitionists have tapped into a great outlet in the MSN world - a whole new captive audience at their finger tips.  The internet has done a great service by linking consenting exhibitionists to voyeurs all over the world with a few simple clicks.  It's no wonder the internet is in so many homes - there is always someone watching and someone to be watched.  But at what point does it stop becoming simply a web cam show and starts transforming itself into amateur porn?  Does it even qualify as amateur porn?  Sure it does!  Someone (who is not a professional porn star) performing a sexual act (in many cases masturbation) for the viewing pleasure of another ... that folks is porn!  And if itis considered porn, then my friends it can't be that bad.... because porn has become a staple in our North American culture.  Turn on the McDonalds commercials with the girls titties selling salads and I think I have proved my point!  Web cams have created a whole new stem of amateur porn that is just begging to be explored.  Show me yours and I will show you mine is beginning to take on a whole new meaning.  Speaking of porn - who took a poll and determined that most chicks are appalled by it?  A recent article in the Toronto Star left me aghast with is assumptions and false claims about women and porn.  So in the next post I will defend those of us females who actually appreciate, like or enjoy porn!  Time to blow my nose, take more pain killers and attempt to remain conscious! XOXO

      I woke up with a cold today - so my normally somewhat functional brain has turned to mush. Usually I average one tangent per strong thought - today it is all tangents.  I keep thinking about last night ... then my mind wanders to my need for more coffee and inevitably to the fact that I crave human contact.  I make it sound like I am a hermit or agoraphobic; I just wonder how much virtual contact is too much before one forgets their actual social graces....  yet with all of this virtual contact I do not feel unfulfilled.    I often find myself questioning how far a person can be pushed against their inhibitions when there is no actual touch or personal interaction?  At what point do people begin to draw the line in the great virtual world?  When you think about it webcam sex is an amazing way to experience something you may be too afraid to seek out in the 'real' world.  Warning tangent time!  I found another poem ... I keep finding them written in the strangest places, perhaps I have an alter-ego that writes them while I think I am asleep!    You gave me everything in passion each touch a cry for more and you left me broken and battered wondering where I went wrong and still today I'd do it all over again just to taste your lips and feel your hands and know you'd make me scream again.   And again not the greatest but I think it sums up that creeping longing to finally get out their and fulfill these fantasies that have been consuming me...  I will end this mindless rambling post with the one line I was able to manage last night ... I am sitting here witnessing the most beautiful site my mind could imagine and he  knows  I am watching -- he is doing it all for me.  Perhaps someone else's thoughts and comments will help me re-focus!  XO

      I came across the poem that that one line came from that I like to roll off my tongue....    Trace in circles your flesh as confused as I am I want to be here And I look at you and I think I want more but I know it will never be You made your mark on me and then left me stranded and then called me back for more I fish for answers to try to calm my mind  I shut down my heart so I can't get hurt And run the risk of never having you for this one moment This moment that is seared in my mind as confused as I am  I know I want to be here again Lust is valid I will argue till I am left with no air  I will argue till you understand  Argue till you agree What is it that is keeping you from being with me?    Not one of my best but it sums up the experience perfectly ...   And tonight I witnessed a new experience ... I cannot give details, but can say it left me in ecstatic awe.  I am overwhelmed.  To that individual I say thank you.  XOXO   Keep the comments coming  - because eventually I will run out of things to write! LOL

      You will have to forgive me, I have only had a half of a coffee this morning so the wheels aren't completely turning just yet.  And I am exhausted from an interesting evening... but no details to share on that just yet.  Love vs. Lust ... opening arguments: Ska boy used to always argue with me that these were the same emotions - then again he really isn't the most reliable source.  Yummy yes - but reliable noooo.    Maybe they are the same just with different degrees of intensity?  But when you throw in sex doesn't that define when the great divide begins?  Strictly as an emotion I can see how lust is just a stepping stone to love.  Sexually though, someone  can  simply  lust  after another person whom they have never met without considering the potential for love - unless of course they are enrolled in Stalking 101.  I know that I have lusted after many and will continue to do so.  And I even admit that acting on that lust without a thought towards love can sometimes be an experience beyond words.  But to lust after someone whom you have only 'met' through the great virtual world of the internet - is that odd?  Or is it any different than admiring someone from afar until you finally get up the nerve to meet them?  I guess what I am getting at is: does lust justify a sexual encounter?  Isn't it just another inhibition we need to overcome in order to feel a sense of self gratification?  Honestly if two people agree that the moment in time is right for the encounter, then lust, love, greed, whatever the motivation doesn't matter.  Unless of course you suddenly develop morals half way through the act.... hmmm...  Later today I am going to attempt to discuss the comments left by others ... so please feel free at anytime to post your comments.  Until then I will consume much more coffee and attempt to shake the cobwebs from my head.

      I think the tangent I wandered into deserves more then that one fleeting acknowledgement.  But as promised I would venture into question #2 from a previous post.  I recall after one brief, yet tantalizing encounter with the yummiest of boys I was inspired to write something that had the line "with fingertips I trace circles in your flesh".  I don't know how that relates to my fantasy turned reality, but I do like how it sounds rolling off of my tongue.   Movie theater, middle back row, people in the theatre - not crowded but not vacant.  Me in a skirt (sans the underwear), him- excitingly eager to touch taste and feel.  Need I say more?  I have thought about this idea for the longest time ... why is it that this is so breathtakingly mesmerizing?  Is it the element of 'ohhhh we may get caught"?  Or is it the thrill of knowing someone may or will be simply watching us?  I brought up this idea to a friend who questioned "but with someone watching doesn't that take the intimacy out of the act?", to which I rebut 'so do vibrators, c*ck rings, handcuffs and magazines.  But millions of people use those and we don't question their intimacy'.  We are a society based on visual stimulation and we are always forced to be the consumer.   Except  every once and awhile a few of us take a stand and become the viewed instead of the viewers.  What could be more intimate then inviting someone into your moment of passion?  Yet at the same time I can see where my friend is coming from, which leads me right back to my tangent and those damn inhibitions ...   When a girl decides to become a porn star (not the crack whore I am doing this for my next hit porn performer) an actual star, what debate goes through her conscience?  I bet she has to struggle with the intimacy factor and the cultural mores engraved in us since birth.  What gets me though is that  traditional    porn (i.e. everything but the world wide web) makes more money yearly in North America the ballet, opera and theater combined.   If we are such an inhibited nation then my God  we must all be closet voyeurs  ... and that means  somebody  has to put on the show.  Think about it ....  I am going to jump right into question #3 because the more I think about it the more absurd that question becomes.  Especially since my history dictates that its been a long time, but not long enough to throw reality out the window.  But I think that this is where the other great debate  lust vs. love  comes into play ... so the next time I will toy with just that!  XOXOXO  An after thought - please feel free to add your comments to any of the posts.  I welcome them in anticipation!

       inÂ·hiÂ·biÂ·tion  n.  The act of inhibiting or the state of being inhibited.  Something that restrains, blocks, or suppresses.  Psychology. Conscious or unconscious restraint of a behavioral process, a desire, or an impulse.    ~(not to be confused with moral: Of or concerned with the judgment of the goodness or badness of human action and character: moral scrutiny; a moral quandary. Conforming to standards of what is right or just in behavior; virtuous: a moral life. Based on strong likelihood or firm conviction, rather than on the actual evidence: a moral certainty)~  When I last posted I decided I wanted to venture into a tangent about inhibitions in our new lifestyle.  Of course one wonders what the heck I mean by new lifestyle ... I guess I am simply referring to the use of the internet as a social outlet.  Well actually a sexual outlet to be exact.  In case you can't already foresee where this is going - I have admitted I am addicted to MSN.  One of the reasons why is that online chat creates a world of intimate encounters without ever having to officially meet someone.  What is it about cyber space that allows one to suddenly lose their inhibitions?  To be willing to bare all over the world wide web to someone who may not even know their name?    I think that once I finally cover Questions #2 & #3 I will venture back into this territory... but until then I need your comments, your thoughts, your adventures... I need to know that what I have encountered isn't rare or maybe is :-D  XOXO

      About three months ago in a frustrated and sleep deprived state I wrote this:  I want to be taken back to those days I fuzzily remember, where every touch melted and every thought collided, where I was someone's and they worshipped me... Am I remembering this correctly? Because my heart still aches and I am still alone.  I guess this begins to sum up my views on the first question from my last post... "What has been my best/most intense sexual experience to date? Why and could that experience ever be recreated?".  I know that no matter how hard I would try to live in the past, there is no way I could ever recreate that one moment in time.  And the question soon becomes why would I even want to recreate or relive it?  Wouldn't new adventures be far more fun?  Groggy from lack of sleep and still stoned I am awoken by gentle kisses on the back of my neck. I am sure he murmurs something in my ear ... but at this point I don't care.  I am with him and that makes me the happiest (little do I know that three weeks later that illusion will be shattered ~ and yes I am still bitter about it).  Because I am still so out of it, every touch seems oddly magnified yet dulled at the same time.    Of course I knew his intentions... and of course there was never any debate when it came to  any  sexual act he requested or desired.  Even though I thought I was always the one in control, I realized very quickly that I was there to fulfill him.  When he took me from behind that early morning, I literally thought I was in Heaven.  I had never felt such intense pleasurable pain before.  I finally understood what it meant when something 'hurt so good'.  And despite many occasions before, that morning marked the day where I learned that it is possible to literally soak the sheets.  I could recount the details of every touch here for you, but I see no purpose in that exercise.  All it will do is frustrat me and make me even more bitter.  However I can pinpoint why that was the most intense experience I have ever had ...  it was pure f*cking.  Nothing held back, no inhibitions, no worries ... Whatever felt good happened.    And that folks sums up that experience ...  I learned that day that lust is a viable emotion.  That love has nothing to do with a sexual experience, as long as you can let go of your inhibitions.    This leads me on a tangent...  Inhibitions  ~ what are they and why do we have them?  In our new lifestyles have they changed and do they even still serve a purpose?  MMhmmm - until then ;-) XOXOXO

       I know - its been awhile since my last post. The truth is I have been realizing dreams rather then just writing about them.       And today marks the first day in well deserved week long vacation. So for the next week you will be subjected to my discoveries and thoughts while on vacation!     Notes to self:      Do not travel to or from Toronto on a weekend when ANY special event is being held. Especially when you have to pee and are three blocks from the apartment and know you can run there faster then the traffic is traveling.  Cum in the eye is not a pleasant experience. However when one asks if it's the Toronto smog that is getting to you - just smile and nod.  Dog will not pee or poop in a strange environment and would rather make you suffer then relieve herself.

      I bought new shoes today - that always puts me in a good mood!  I admit I am a shoe whore .. but a girl has to have many passions!  One of my favourite  classic  sites is back up and running and amuses me to no end every time I pull it up!   urlLink http://www.madsci.org/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/~lynn/jardin/SCG/   Be sure to be surrealistly complimented yourself!  And if you feel the need to shower me with many presents ... you can never go wrong with pink things (especially pink sock monkeys!).  I think new shoes turn me into a girlie girl!  On a more serious note ... my personal life has taken an interesting turn.  As you may already know I have been fallen since the moment I met the boy; now I am ready to fall even more.  I have taken a big step and faced my fears and realized that I am so ready to let him into my life!  (he makes me soooo happy!)   So let the games begin!

      If I could pace the floor I would.  I have never been one for waiting... in fact I am grossly impatient.  I am still awaiting the transfer status of my credits.  Still awaiting my schedule to be posted at work to see if my hours are cut back.  Still waiting (yet again) to be back in my baby's arms .. *sigh* and on top of all that I still haven't had the time I wanted to work on anything.    Sucks how life gets in the way.  But I had yet another amazing weekend.  I have found literally everything in a person I didn't even know I was looking for.  My partner and nemesis all in one.  Someone who challenges me but keeps me grounded.  Someone who seems to read me and my needs.  It will be such delicious fun to explore the future.  That is once I am done waiting...  I hate waiting ...

      Did I ever mention I hate moving?  Oh no it wasn't me moving, it was the boy.  Although I was grateful to spend the day with him, I think under other circumstances it would have been more enjoyable.  However this new apartment means being able to set up many cameras ... hmmm.  The good news... my work hours have officially been cut back.  The bad news ... less money coming in to do research and make the doc ... *sigh*

       Today is officially my last day of vacation. I slept in far too late, got groceries and went to the new casino. I want to go to Vegas even more now, and I want to take the boy with me. In fact I want to have the boy with me everywhere, anywhere, forever...  Going to the dr's tomorrow. See if I can go back on the pill. You would think that there would be more options, but meh no, my body doesn't take well to hormones ... If it was a man that had to be worried about getting pregnant and he couldn't take hormones - you know they would have a solution for it instantly.  I am still amazed at the amount of crap I have amassed. I need to scale down even more ... I guess I am just thinking towards the future and the hopefully idea that I will eventually be moving. Yup, get a decent job in the big city, move to the big city, and take less of my amassed crap with me. That's the plan.  Well, I guess I should consider going to bed eventually tonight. Except I slept in way too much and I am no where near sleepy. Guess that's the vicious cycle of being lazy... Soon that laziness will be taken over by insanity again. In a way I can't wait.

       The boy had to leave today - so I have been in a sucky mood all day. Haven't even bothered to get dressed. Seems pointless when there is no one around except for four legged furry beasties. I hope the boy knows how much this past week meant to me and how wonderful it was to have him beside me everyday.  I got around to posting more crap on eBay. This after I decided it was time to finally start cleaning up my mounds of stuff. Threw out boxes of boxes ... not sure why I was keeping quite so many. Came across some clothes I forgot I even had too. No money though - too bad :(  Downloaded the pictures from the vacation with the boy. He is truly the yummiest - of course I am biased. Mind you others agree that he is amply endowed and looks tasty - so I know its not just me.  I guess I will go protest my loneliness by eating something completely unhealthy for me.  Jalapeno stuffed poppers  sounds tempting about now. I guess absence makes the heart ache, but makes the reunions so much better. Soon I hope I don't have to go through this every week.

      Today was the last full day to spend with the boy.  Makes me sad to part ways again for a week - guess in a way that is a good sign.  Got home to a house full of cats - good thing I left with a house full of cats or I would be shocked.  As independent as they are the kitties were grateful to have someone home again all the time.  Captured some very interesting video while on vacation.  Very enjoyable to create and watch.  Shame I can't share it here *giggles*!

      Hard to believe that on Tuesday I have to go back to work. Although this time has given me a chance to think. I really need to find work that is better suited for me. Where I can be creative and use all of the edu-ma-cation I have earned.  More alone time with the boy, more play, more exploring, more just enjoying our love. It will be hard to part again after this week. One of the suckiest things about a long distance relationship ...  I am going to apply with purpose to all jobs that I want. Whether at home or in TO. I need to break free from this cycle. And with the new school semester I think its time to just jump in head first. Pissed off though. My course is barely part time which means I will have to start paying back OSAP unless I take a few extra courses elsewhere. A good thought but still have to crunch the numbers. Also have to wait till the end of the month to discover if I really do need to seriously find a new job too .... who knows if my contract will be re-newed, and if I even want to stay.    Note to self: buy the boy a toy and use it on him.

       Finally a full day alone with the boy. Time to enjoy each other. Now I know my new favourite form of exercise :-D Thank gwad the boy enjoys exploring, and dress up and toys...      Dog has finally decided that yes, she can pee and poop in a strange neighborhood.      Had New Gen Sushi for lunch. If in TO you must go (  urlLink  http://www.newgeneration.7h.com/   ), the Crunch Maki set is very yummy. Wish I had millions of dollars to forever eat sushi, drink expensive coffee and buy pretty pink sparkly things.      Musn't forget went to Urban store, wanted to get new binder for studies. Will not in my right mind pay $22 for a binder - even if it is pink and has the Paul Frank monkey on it- except of course unless it write my thesis paper for me. However, I did get a sweet purse. Oh my I am turning into a girlie girl!

       Day #2 - OK off to the cottage we head! Sure its Sunday just before noon - who is going to be on the roads now?  Apparently half of the freekin' GTA.  It took  3.5 hours  to get from Canada's Wonderland to just out side of Barrie. Wooo hooo! Let the good times roll! Finally get to cottage, sigh of relief.   Remember to look up Christadelphians.       Day #3 - Sun, sand and sleep. Dog apparently does not understand the concept of the boat and does splits trying to board. Ahhh so nice, but can't wait to get back to the Big City to spend some 'quality time' with the boy *wink*.      Day #4 - Head back to the city. Thankfully traffic has subsided. Note to self: get diaper for future road trips as a spastic bladder is not pleasant to deal with!  Looked up Christadelphians:  urlLink http://www.christadelphian.org.uk/ .  Sure, whatever makes your boat float.
