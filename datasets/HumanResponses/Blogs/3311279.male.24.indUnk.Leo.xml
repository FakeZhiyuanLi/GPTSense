      How come when companies like Sony or Microsoft create a proprietary format, some people figure it out and everyone yells "good!" Apple is  urlLink just as evil  if not more so, in part because they pretend so well to be the anti-evil of consumerism. And, they are just as greedy as the next publicly traded stock ticker acronym, regardless of whether or not they make the most sought-after peice of portable, consumer-grade, audio hardware since the transistor radio. We as people, and not consumers, need to be aware that the tactics consistently used by most major profiteering operations are the same irrespective of how many designer colours the latest fad is marketed in.    Update - 01/08/2004 : Apple's probably not happy about  urlLink their chances .

      So we're all happy IBM is defending our turf. At the cost of sounding blasphemous I think, though, we should be at least slightly wary; they really wouldn't be defending Linux et. all with such rigour if nothing was in it for them. IBM has been known to edge towards the  urlLink dark side  before. Just a thought.

      Continuing from the brief bit about the iPod, I've been looking into getting a new cell phone lately, and I can't help but he struck by all the ridiculous proprietary formats and interfaces that plague these devices. While the ultra-closed iPod is an exception because of it trendy status, I do think that device adoption in the public would be better if manufacturers would only realise that proprietary is pass&eacute;. The problem though, doesn't lie with them [the manufacturers] because if it weren't for the fact people were still buying these "locked-out" devices, the companies wouldn't still be making them.   Take the  urlLink Nokia 6230  for example. GSM cell phone, VGA digital camera, MP3 player, EDGE capability, bluetooth, removable MMC storage (upwards of 512MB); all in all a highly affordable package. Caveat? The headphones attach via a proprietary "PopPort." This same interface is used to connect the phone to the computer. Where's our USB port when we need it? Who carries around a "PopPort" compatible data cable?  While these seem like minor complaints they remain serious issues for product development, open standards and inter-operability. It's time we set the standards; demanding more "open," development-friendly devices which make our lives easier because they fit our needs and allow us to work in a personal, comfortable manner. A manner that allows us to use our existing infrastructure whether it be as simple as a pair of headphones or a USB cable. I mean have you ever seen a high-tech junky travel? It's all cables and wires when it should be the exact opposite. Weren't all these devices supposed to free us from something? Instead we're getting tangled in the mess (pun most definitely intended.)   Over and out.

      Sources, who chose to remain anonymous out of fear for the safety of themselves and their families, have provided us with these two pictures depicting Alex Tilley's smug mug "untouched" (left) and then "airbrushed" (right) for the Tilley Socks packaging.   We can only hope the disturbing original is a fake but some experts I've consulted with, namely myself, agree that if it is indeed a fake, it's a very convincing one. I wouldn't want to meet that guy alone in the woods when he's run out of toilet paper; especially if he's alone because his wife left him due to the fact that the socks he bought her wore out before their three year guarantee was up and the company wouldn't keep their comitment to provide a replacement pair. Additionally his own socks are soggy and cold because they, most certainly, aren't Tilleys.   It should be noted that the authenticity of these photos has not been verified by the Tilley Endurables corporate office. (We, that royal we again, were too lazy to call for comment.)

      So here it is folks. The scans of the Tilley socks packaging (click to see the scans in their full glory):   urlLink   &nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink     It was the fateful reading of the packaging by my good friend MixMikesterMike which convinced me to take the challenge of wearing these leg warmers out. Questions have already started to arise concerning my dedication to the cause and, more importantly, people are starting to wonder whether they want to be around someone who's been wearing the same socks for months. I suggest that this concern is also a perfect opportunity to test the "fast drying" claims of Tilley Endurables.   One can't help but wonder how much thought, or possibly how little, went into the design, testing, manufacture and marketing of two pieces of glorified wool. Perhaps these socks are merely a ploy to interest would-be consumers in other Tilley products. People perusing this poor-excuse for a science experiment have already made mention of several other interesting Tilley products; although perhaps puzzling is a better way to put it. Somehow I think Alex Tilley has a few of tricks up his short-sleeved polo shirt. And besides, he's not wearing his socks in two out of five of the pictures on his company's homepage. Product placement anyone?

      The socks have now been removed from their packaging. Those interested in the meticulous surgery required to separate the socks from their cardboard cell can click on the image below and relive the much-anticipated event that took place this morning. Many thanks to Andreas for his skilled web-cam-wielding.   urlLink     Now I was quite prepared to go on at great length about this experience. As much I would like to re-tell the tale, in excruciating detail, of the fondling, caressing, cutting, comparison and general getting-to-know-my-new-foot-companions, something else occurred just a few minutes ago which places serious doubt in my mind regarding the supposed "high quality" craftsmanship of these socks. As it stands now, having simply removed the socks from their life of cardboard captivity, if I were to rate their out-if-the-gate performance in terms of successful political careers, I would have to say they are currently faring no better than  urlLink Kim Campbell  did on November 4, 1993.   As I was probing the texture of the socks, attempting to discern what level of comfort they would provide my feet, I noticed that the other half of the plastic "thingy" which held the socks to the back of the packaging was still entrenched deep in one of the socks. I tried to gently pull it out, but alas, it would not give. I tugged.    urlLink    Now that's what I call quality.  Considering the ridiculous amount of propaganda which is disseminated by Tilley Endurables via the packaging and the  urlLink product page  on their  urlLink website , one would assume Tilley Endurables would have done the appropriate R&D; designing the plastic "thingy" to pose no significant threat to the material stability of the socks themselves. This event does not bode well for the longevity of the socks and, to quote The Dude, it's a bummer man.    urlLink    The Plastic Thingy.  They're not very pretty either. That being said, what they lack in style they make up for in size. I mean they are all sock baby. We're talking a good 24-26" here: more than enough to get size-induced sock-envy going in any self-respecting, half-calf, walking-sock lover. I've seen ladies sport shirts with less material than the amount they've weaved into a single Tilley Walking Sock. To be honest, if I wasn't so determined to test out Tilley's three year guarantee, I wouldn't be caught dead sporting these leg warmers.   Despite some distasteful setbacks my resolve remains firm.    "God willing, we will prevail, in peace and freedom from fear, and in true health, through the purity and essence of our natural... fluids. God bless you all."  -  urlLink General Jack D. Ripper      Note: This link originally pointed to the Tilley Endurables Unholey Walking Socks product information page but it seems, in some fit of ingenuity, the Tilley.com website does not allow external linking to specific product pages making the promise of quick access to information via the internet null and void. Yet another chink in your armour Alex.

      It just occurred to me that the infamous nail-sticking-out-of-hardwood-floor could pose a serious health risk to even the most solidly constructed sock.   Point in case is the time I was wearing a brand new (first wear) pair of Adidas socks whilst hanging at Mix Mikester Mike's place in NYC. A piece of wood delineating the floor change from living/dining/guest sleeping/tv room to kitchen caused a gaping 1 cm gash in the aforementioned socks. I'm curious if such events will be covered by the Tilley guarantee because, as my brother pointed out, the intended (and proper) usage of the Tilley Socks is within the context of equally over-manufactured footwear. I'm the kind of jerk whose socks wear out because he's too lazy to wear slippers in the home.   I have a feeling that if Tilley Endurables gets wind of this blog, their products are going to start being sold with a half pound book, a-la Microsoft-style licensing agreement, detailing the "fair use" of Tilley Walking socks, and their related guarantee.

      A single pair of socks worn daily without end means that they will have to be washed frequently. I don't think daily washing is an option though. I'd be hard pressed to find enough clothing to run a daily washer and a dryer cycle. Heck I'm lucky if I do it weekly; and those are good weeks.   I'm actually curious as to how many washes constitute abuse of said socks. Nowhere on the packaging does it mention the  mean washes between failures  rating of these puppies. New car owners are familiar with the standard 3 year/120,000 km warranties (sample figures) automobile manufacturers provide with their product - it's hard not be a little suspicious that Tilley Endurables has the same trick up their sleeves, or perhaps more appropriately, tucked just below their cuffs. Because Alex Tilley is smiling on the package doesn't mean he's beyond sitting behind a desk with his lawyers trying to figure out a way to shut this whole project down.   Shortly (give me a day or two), detailed images of the socks and their packaging will be posted at my website, and you'll find all the necessary links right here, along with a minute-by-minute account of the momentous occasion, as well as a serious inspection of the socks' construction quality. The post game show will consist of decisions regarding the rules for the (almost) non-stop sock wearing once it begins. There will also be an announcement of the "official" first-wear date. Stay tuned.

      ... they claim to be, and I quote, "Guaranteed to last 3 years." Which means that  it's time to see if:   1 -   A single pair of "Unholey Tilley 'Walking' Socks" will last anywhere near 3 years being used (almost*) daily.  I mean lets (and by using the plural form of lets I mean we, the royal we) pretend I'm backpacking Montreal for a year and I only have this one pair of socks. If this is to be truly done, with all the heart and effort of a geeky high school science project (don't get me started) then there will have to be some ground rules: I need some ground rules because I personally believe that the two most important parts of a wardrobe are socks and boxers. I'm the kind of idiot who will gladly pay $20 for boxers or socks, and still wear a torn and fraying shirt. That being said committing to wear the same socks day in and day out is a serious affair. Anyway, the only time I will wear socks other than the "Unholey of Holies" is during physical activity, where the half-knee height of these bad boys will probably get me a good beating. Even the pointing and laughing is something I can't handle when I'm trying to pop a vein in my forehead pedaling up the molehill we call a "Mountain" here in Montreal. Other than that I will have no excuse. Weddings, business meetings, nights out, nights in, longs forays in the can; the Tilley's will remain at my feet.   2 -  Tilley Endurables will respect their 3 year commitment to the wellbeing of my feet.  Firstly they were a gift. I don't know when the socks were bought but they've sat in their package for a number of months. Four months to be exact. I will firmly argue that the guarantee doesn't start until they hit my feet for the first time. Seeing as though I will carefully document even the most mundane Tilley-related events such as the official separation of package and sock, the ridiculous close-up inspection of sock build prior to first use, and the over-analysis of some of the most ridiculous sock rhetoric ever, it will most obviously be dated (by Blogger) when the socks hit the downstairs digits. As for witnesses, well I know at least Andy is tuning in to see this one unfold. Hehe, I said unfold. I also wonder if Tilley Endurables will attempt to weasel out of their 3 year commitment by making an issue out of the concurrent number of days the socks were in use without rest. Perhaps they will also be none-too pleased with my fun making of their painstaking attempt to market these socks to the biggest losers on the planet, regardless of the good idea that guaranteed-for-3-year socks may be.      3 -  Replacement of the Tilley's is swift and efficient.  Tilley's wouldn't profit from the bad press of having forced my feet to suffer in my ordinary Buffalo, Addidas, Fubu, and  the general non-wicking-away-of-moisture-and-most-definitely-not-fast-drying socks I've been forking up all this cash to wear before experiencing the strange new land of the "Unholey of Holies."  4 -  The replacements are covered by the same guarantee as the originals.  This will be the ultimate test of the Tilley Endurables textile reputation. Perhaps I may go so far as to say that if, in the case that the first pair of socks wear out before the three years is up, and they are replaced with merchandise provided with the same promise of almost unbelievable longevity, I may very well be running this experiment for some years.   3 Years? Want proof?      Here's a rough image of the front packaging. I took this (and the above) picture with my webcam provided graciously by  urlLink ZeD Tv . Once the socks have been removed from their sarcophagus, I'll make high quality scans of it so you can enjoy the delightful nature of the reading material provided with said socks.      *I'm not  that  stupid. Stupid.

      I was going to go on and on, at great length, about a number of things which have happened recently to prevent my continued devotion to my socks project. While the socks never did hit my feet, they were constantly on my mind. I apologize to all for the lengthy delay.  My original plan for the socks involved drawing out the pre-wearing period to such an extent that by the time the socks were worn for the first time it would be ridiculously climactic. I was going to seriously analyze the sock construction (which I may still do), have outside "expert" opinions on the socks and their possible uses... the list went on.   As it so happened this past Saturday (June 12th to be exact) was my sister's wedding. I was the poor sap chosen to provide the music for said event, and I must say it was a great time. Alas, I digress. They real juice is here: My suit consisted of 3 parts tuxedo, one part shiny-new-green dress shirt (open collar with chest hair exposed), and one part army boots (quickly shined). As I was dressing I realized that the  only  compliment to such a cross between uber-formal and ultra-casual dress had to be the Tilley's. So without fanfare (and  only two pictures which have yet to be developed) the socks were mounted to my feet and worn from 1:30 PM until 3:00 AM. The socks were used to mingle, gape in awe, help propose the toast to the bride and groom, make random anouncements about lost keys, mix some kick-ass tunes together and, on occasion, make their way out to the dance floor to, as they say, get down.  While I'm currently in a rush to get out of here, I can say this: that the socks were able to respond to my every requirement throughout the evening, despite the rather nasty footwear that surrounded them. When duty called the socks stood up and took it in stride.  Here's a shot of the socks, in their exact at-rest position after their first wear:    Stay tuned for a full review of my first 13.5 hours in these socks.

      It's been over a month and a half since the first wear, so it's definitely about time they get a decent review.  In fact they deserve more than a simple decent review. These socks have touched me in a way, well, pretty much the way every sock touches me, but you know, creative license and all that.    Anyway, June 12, 2004 was the date of my sister's wedding. I figured what event would provide a better jumping off point for the socks than spending over 12 hours in them, on my feet. You see, my gift at the wedding was more than some inanimate object, mein gift was the P-A-R-T-Why? Because we gotta. I was zee Dee Jay.  And did I ever dee jay; although a piece of arrogant drivel on that subject I will save for yet another to-be-blog. We are here to talk about the socks after all.    There are several pictures of me putting on the socks. Unfortunately they are not of the digital type and as such the laziness that permeates my life will ensure they are not developed for some time. Those holding their breath, the few, the rare, the dedicated will stop either because they realise it's futile or because their hemoglobin simply has no oxygen left to carry leaving their brains to wither and backfire as they suffocate. Purple really isn't a nice skin tone.  Good luck with all of that.    I should add that there was serious backlash to my fun-making of these socks. It seems that those who, much like the  urlLink Alexander Keiths  adverts, like the socks, like them   a lot . Offence has been taken when my attitude towards these strange pieces of textile produce has been on public display. Several people, including my father and brother (who were both given a pair at the same time as I) were insulted by my stated attempt to prove how ridiculous a 3-year warranty on a sock would be and, in fact, is. My resolve, as always, remained firm.    Irrespective, and with much prejudice, I went on with my quest. I must say I am left speechless at the quality of these socks. For all intents and purposes my initial, but admittedly cursory, inspection of these textile products led me to believe that they were of shoddy construction and decidedly uncomfortable both in shape and material texture. Once they were on my feet I can only say that I was absolutely mislead on all accounts.    You see, not only was I to wear these socks for more than 12 hours straight (in fact they were mounted to my feet at 1:25 PM and were not taken off until 3:14 AM the following morning - you do the math), they were also worn inside a pair of cold-war-era army boots while standing almost the entire time. They provided my feet with a suppressions stable environment. My feet remained comfortable, never too warm and never clammy, despite the boots. Some of my most prized socks have not held up to a short afternoon of the army boots in question, much less an evening of standing, dancing and general getting-down.    The material of the socks felt plush and welcoming against my feet, not cold and alienating as my initial inspection would have led me to believe. While the socks are not transparent during the wearing - I was aware of them the entire night - their presence was made known by a level of comfort and security few of my go-to socks can even hope to attain at that climactic point on the verge of infinite familiarity and holes just prior to sudden death.      I hope to have more data to expound upon in the future as the wear cycle increases with frequency in the coming weeks. More on that in a day or two.    All in all I must say Tilley Endurables have discovered a fine product here. That being said I'm still going to run these babies into the ground. Just you wait and see. In fact, stay tuned for updates on their extended and intense abuse cycle which is about to begin. And because I like them, that three years is going to be even more difficult to attain. And you thought you'd won Alex. Well the battle's only just begun.      Yeah that's right.  These socks are coming home in a body bag.
