      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7 Years Later   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Robert Freeman, an agent for the FBI, was standing next to a dead man's silhouette.&nbsp; The investigative team hasn't been able to identify the body, and yet they remained on the crime scene trying to sort things out.&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert laghed at the&nbsp;site of&nbsp;all of them acting like ants, hurrying along before a storm comes and ruins it all. &nbsp;He walked to his car and sat in the driver's seat.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's your assessment Freeman?" Roberts superior Captain Anthony White asked while he peered down at him.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hell if I know," Robert replied as White laughed.&nbsp; Robert didn't know or really care that much.&nbsp; The victim was Caucasian and in his early thirties.&nbsp; His cause of death was still unknown.&nbsp; The man looked fine.&nbsp; Nothing seemed wrong with him, he was just dead.&nbsp; Like he just deiced to stop living.&nbsp; The body was at the morgue for a full autopsy, and they hadn't yet received word on the man's Identity or cause of death.&nbsp; They were just scavenging for any more evidence they could find.&nbsp;  Robert sat back in his car shuffling through pictures of the man before he was taken to be examined.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, Freeman!&nbsp; Go to the morgue and pick up the report on this guy."&nbsp; White ordered as Robert closed his car door and drove off.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was on his way to the morgue, driving down the highway.&nbsp; He began to contemplate, he thought of his mother and glanced at his left arm.&nbsp; Scars lined his wrist.&nbsp; He made those scares.&nbsp; He made them at the lowest point in his life. 'Why had I been so stupid?' he questioned himself silently.&nbsp; He vowed his life would never sink so low again.  He pulled up into the parking lot of the Government building.&nbsp; A man in a white lab coat came outside, he looked surprised to see him there.&nbsp; The man spoke into a radio while staring at the approaching car.&nbsp; Robert pulled up next to the man and got out.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I uh, wasn't expecting an you to be here," he said as Robert got out of his car.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not?&nbsp; we're all waiting on that report," he told but the man still didn't understand.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Report?"&nbsp; the man asked as Robert read his nametag.&nbsp; Greg Staton.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Listen, just take me to the autopsy room," he instructed Greg. He then turned around and walked through the doors and down the hall.&nbsp; "So uh, Greg," Robert said to get his attention, but the man did not reply.&nbsp; "hey, Greg," he said this time taping on his shoulder.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, yes-me . . .sorry," he replied, as they walked into the autopsy room. X-ray pictures covered an entire wall.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sir?"&nbsp; The doctor said as Robert turned to face him, the doctor was extremely nervous as if his very life hung in the balance and one little tip of the scale would kill him, "I did a complete examination and found that his death was caused crushing of his brain."&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What could this mean doctor?&nbsp; How is this possible?"- his cell phone rang.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is Freeman."&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "yo, Bobby this is Carter."  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want?"&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We identified the body, he is John Tyres.&nbsp; So we did a background check on the guy.&nbsp; He is a former associate of Lavits Sokal and Geoff Moore."  Sokal . . . where had he heard that name before, "Did you look them up?"&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "By now I thought you would know not to ask stupid questions like that, of course I did.&nbsp; Sokal was a preacher, but disappeared seven years ago.&nbsp; And Moore was a multi-billionaire, but he passed away five years ago leaving his vast fortune and successful business to his son Michael.&nbsp; Then Michael died in a mysterious accident a year later and it was all given to Moore's adopted son Saul Kovin." Carter slowly informed.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So where is this kid?" Robert requested pondering the idea of a teenager owning a successful business.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He lives in his late father's mansion, which is on the outskirts of New York."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Saul Kovin stared blankly into the demented eyes of Lavits Sokal, his hands were crimson stained.  Saul peeked into his brother's dimly lit room.  Saul was almost six, but he kept his nerve and remained silent.  He felt cold inside, unaware of the cold loneliness of death.  Saul crept closer to the barely opened door, just out of Sokal's sight.  Shock fired through him.  He began to sweat.  His mother and his brother were lying next to each other in a pool of blood.  Saul stepped back and tripped over himself, hitting the floor with a loud sound.  Sokal stepped slowly out of the room and looked at Saul lying helpless on the ground. "What did you see!?"  He questioned as Saul looked up to the towering preacher. "I-I"  He stammered as Sokal lifted his blood-drenched knife. "What did you"-The doorbell rang.  Fear defied his ambition as he stared at the door.  He then turned to Saul with a glare of defeat, "I will come back for you little boy.  I will receive what I came here for, even if it takes years.  I will return for your blood . . ." He the slid into the shadows and left.  The doorbell rang again, neglecting Saul's vulnerable emotions.  So he stood up and opened the door, it was Jackie his brother's girlfriend. "Hey Saul, is your brother home?" She asked as she noticed the grim look on his face, "what's wrong?" "He's dead." 	Saul stared down into the grave of his mother just as the preacher ended his prayer.  All the people dressed in black began to slowly leave.  Then a man Saul was not familiar with walked up to him.   	"Saul, I'm John, one of your mom's friends.  Listen, since both your parents have passed away a nice old man has decided to adopt you." 	Then an older gentleman came up to them, "You don't think I'm that old do you?  Sure I'm not as young as I used to be but, well . . . ah never mind."  He then looked at Saul, "hello there young man, my name is Geoff Moore.  I have invited you into my home, since you don't have anyone to stay with and I wouldn't want you to get lonely" 	          Sokal did not attend church that Sunday, or the next.  He disappeared.
