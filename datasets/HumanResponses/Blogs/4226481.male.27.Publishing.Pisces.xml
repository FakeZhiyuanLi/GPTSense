       I have at last succumbed to the odd phenomenon of waking at the same time everyday no matter how late I stayed up the night before. It is about nine now, and I've been up for a half hour.  I shouldn't be up. I mean, it's fine that I am. But I belong in bed. I should be sleeping the day away... or at least the morning. That's what weekends, and particularly Sundays are for, right? I'll probably enjoy the early afternoon Sunday nap later on to make up for it.
 
The kids downstairs had this huge party last night. I felt old and preferred to hang out with my roommates and a couple close friends out on my balcony instead. I did have to walk through the mass a couple times since they completely overtook the patio downstairs. I live in a duplex by the way. This may help your visualization of the event. "The neighbors" are three girls in college and I believe they are all 20.
 
 The half empty plastic cups downstairs are strewn about in such a haphazard way that it is actually rather asthetically pleasing. Like the footprints of a decent party, they remind me of many a college night of my own back in the day.

       Great storm yesterday. It knocked out power at work for a good half hour or so. Somehow, I managed to find the window in the downpour and made the 45 min bike ride home without getting too wet. This city doesn't drain very well, as most people know. Something about the sewer system dating back to civil war days.
  
I think it rather suits Atlanta. I mean, this whole place is chaotic. I still get lost around here and I live here. The traffic is unbelievable, full of people upset about traffic who do nothing but add to the craziness. They throw huge metal plates over the potholes and leave them there for weeks - something altogether fascinating to me. Somewhere in this town there's a warehouse full of these things waiting to be thrown down haphazardly on a nearby street.

       Harold and Kumar was surprisingly entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and the Bourne Supremecy before it was alright. The drive-in has to be the best bargain in the city. I mean, six bucks, two movies, and a whole world of sideshows by the people in the adjacent cars. A cooler full of beer doesn't hurt either.
 Now a grilled cheese, a glass of water and a blog. Aaaahhh, that's nice.

       So, here I am... it's 9:13 according to my fiery red LED alarm clock. I'm awake but I shouldn't be. I should be sleeping off this mild headache. But, thanks to my body being accustomed to rising around this hour, I cannot get back to sleep. Alas, I'll use the otherwise zombie-like waking hour to blog. 
 This is blog #2 for me. I'll probably stop numbering them after this. Not that I can't count past two mind you, but who really needs a running tally of my mindless early morning after heavy partying ramblings?
  By the way, El Myr makes the best green burritos in the world. I like them with a frosty PBR, the workingman's beer. I think I may have dreamed about it too.

       No one will ever read this. I mean, who blogs these days? Certainly no one I know. Still, for whatever reason I find it interesting enough to give a shot. and with that allow me to present this introductory blog for anyone bored enough to care.
