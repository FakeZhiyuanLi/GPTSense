      I'm sitting here, half awake. Thinking that in just a few short hours I will have my Senior Orientation. I have no idea what I should be feeling. The best way to describe my emotion right now would be fear, mixed with curiosity and excitement. I also have a feeling of hope that things will work out. I really don't know the problems but I think a lot of them will be solved this year. It is kind of sad that most of these people I won't talk to again. I'm also shocked that I'm already done with three years of high school. I hope that everyone has matured. Hopefully the days of stupid comments are over. Plus if the maturity level will be high then people will stop being so shallow and self centered. It will be fun to see everyone again. I hope my classes are fill with friends. Or life could be very dull. And what is the point of leading a dull life. Life is to beautiful to waste. Oh well. Time to go. Bye ~~~ Phydeaux

      Ah.  Summer, a time for vacation and leisure time.  Yeah right.  Not with my mom.  My mom has not let me sleep past 8 am every single morning this summer.  She says I will waste it if I don't go out and do things.  My favorite thing to do on my time off is to do NOTHING.  Sure doing stuff every now and then is good.  But I see nothing wrong with just relaxing on the couch watching some TV.  Then do stuff completely pointless like going for a walk at midnight or just driving around with friends.  My mom fails to realize that stupid stuff is fun.   Any way, now I'm writing you this from Hilton Head South Carolina.  The first few days were great, because my mom wasn't there.  She is here now.  And now my friend and I get to do all of the chores.  She seems to try and make my life difficult.  All my friends see it.  My step dad even sees it so don't give me the your mom knows best crap.  She makes me do all sorts of shit that she should be doing herself.  And this morning she wakes us up early by blaring music.   Now she is on this kick about me going to this local community college saying that I'm not good enough to go on campus.  I scored a 1280 on the SATs and I have a 3.70 GPA.  I think I can make it into the dorms.  The main reason I want to go to the dorms is because I will be away from her.  She is a tyrant who is always belittling me and treating me like shit.  One more year till I'm away.  THANK GOD!!!  Oh well, I'm done ranting for a while.  I'll add more later.

      Finding one's true self is difficult.  I have not succeeded at this task.  I believe that finding yourself is a requirement for finding true love.  Finding your true self requires a great deal of dicipline and maturity.  At the rate I am currently going, I will never be ready for true love.  Trying to find out who I am has only hurt people who are around me.  The battle that rages between my temples sometimes gets out of hand and causes me to hurt others.  Thus causing them to leave.  Pain adds to the confusion.  During my years in high school the confusion has only increased many fold.  I hope that college does not cause me to become deeper lost in the haze of my mind.  Lost and confused within oneself is no way to go through life.  Uncertainty within oneself causes doubt in life.  This doubt can consume and make the person fearful of life.  Life is to be lived honestly and openly.  Only then can true happiness come about.  That is all for now.  If I receive enough comments about this, I will add more later.  Good luck in finding your true selves.     ~~Phydeaux

      Phydeaux.  My other name.  This comes from some odd things.  First of all I train dogs with my mom.  I deal with bitches all day I guess you could say.  Anyway, Phydeaux is pronounced like FIDO.  The common dog name.  But my friend so I was more civilized than that so I made it the long spelling.   That is the reason for that.  It works for me.  Plus I need a nickname because of my name, Michael.  Way to many people have that name so it's hard to tell us apart.  Later.  Have fun, love and prosperity follow you wherever you go.

      I was just putting up this post because some people may not get the name of the website. This will explain it.  During English class last year we had to write out some essays for college. One of the essays was "Who are you?" I didn't know. So I wrote that I didn't know who I was. So my teacher said write something else. I thought about myself and I realized I didn't really know who I was. I learned that my life was a charade. I was made up of facades. So I wrote my essay saying that I was made up of many facades that come together that   are like shards of a crystal   that come together to form a crystal.    There is that name. Enjoy. If you want a copy of the essay I'll try to find one. Just let me know.  I'll talk about this more later.  Rebels don't cause trouble, Trouble causes rebels.  Phydeaux
