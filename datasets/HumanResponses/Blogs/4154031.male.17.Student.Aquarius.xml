        9th of August 2004                    Well, many Singaporeans mayb thinking of the national day celebrations, but i am stuck in my room thinking of her... I have been deciding whether to send her a SMS for the last hour and in the end i use a coin to decide- tails (Dont send)! It not as easy as you think... Sometimes i wonder whether do i mean anything to her?!?! Wad if she finds me an irritant?!?! haiz, we dont talk not to say that we look at each other...                I am not blaming her, but rather i am blaming myself. I am always giving that 'dao' attitulde to her, making her invisible to my eyes! I dunno why i did that for?? Pride, i guess. But even then, i am abit SHY... :) haha! Well seriously, i really dunno wad to do... I dont think she will even take the initiative to talk to me. So its up to me, after all! Shit, i hate this feeling... I do not have this feeling when i am too engross with my work!!! thats y, i did not talk to her since June... I just hope she knows that i still like her and ya...               Abt the SMS, i shall see whether to send later in the afternoon or night... Haiz!!!!

        6th of August 2004,     What a Day?!?! A day of relief and a day of disappointment... Haha, but also a day of commenmoration for my first every BLOG! Well, today we celebrated our nation's 39th birthday. I was in-charge of this Candle Montage Light Up and you know what, it was darn disater. Wind Wind Wind, the flame kept getting blown off... Mayb God wasnt on my side, haiz! But at least i had done my best after 2 months of stupid planning and nagging from the Mentors(bloody irritants) which took away all my personal life... sobz... Luckily its all over, they cant do anything to me  ;o)  ! Oops, not yet... Dam! Have to be involve in the LOVE MERIDIAN DAY at the end of this month... Whatever, i Gonna Slack as much as i can and hopefully, they wont bug me so much... hehe! So my personal life resume from today, what next? I wonder. 1) Becoming a hardcore mugger for promo, 2) Being my 'usual' self or 3) giving one last try for her. Haiz, i really dunno... Its so hard to keep my feelings from her... but what can i do?!?! I dont even have the guts to face her, haha! So useless right... I thought that this feeling would die off somehow as time goes by, but it never did!!! I dont know if you consider it as love or what, only time will tell i guess... To my dearest Patricians, you guys rock... Jus miss the days we play, fight, cry and study together... Well, I hope you all are doing fine! Anyway i will be organising a 4E1 reunion party at the end of the year, so ya pls keep it in your mind... As for the Juniors, your prelim are coming real soon... must jia you OK! I think you all can do it... Anyway gtg now, see you guys soon
