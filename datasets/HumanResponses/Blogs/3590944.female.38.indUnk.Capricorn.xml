      School is done, and locked up tight. Now the kids can be up late every night. Time is not an issue, as our clocks will no longer exist We will remove our watches from each or our wrists. Clean clothes and lunches are no longer a worry No longer do I own the words "C,mon we need to hurry" The rules have changed for the summers events I am in charge of the time that computers and games will be spent The choice to play, read and think will be priority one. They of course will say that is no fun. It's just a little experiment that I plan to put to the test. This change for all, is for the best. I want them to feel the day, as each hour unfolds and how each day will bring them their own pot of gold. I want to get up and be able to decide.. where will this day take us, and what direction will we go for a ride. So diligence on my part, to stick to my deal,  and not cave when the behaviour is unreal. Not so much the boy, although he is addicted to all his electronic toys It's the girl that will be the issue, and her howls will bring me no joy! Without the competition of TV's, playstation controllers, and computer games, The kids will actually listen, when I call their names.... As our summer unfolds we will hunt for our summer kingdom,  And rejoice in the moments that WE will all feel the freedom.

      This morning I took my new runners for a walk out on the dyke. It was just me on my lonesome, I couldn't convince any other part of the family to come with me... and that didn't include the dogs, they were not invited. I will thank the Big Guy for my amazing (and yet uneventful) adventure. I can't figure out why the person on the horse could not make it move, or the lady with the regular looking sandals wore the ridiculous black socks.. or how come the man on the bike was not going to answer questions until they got to the park, as stated by him, and overheard by me. Now this puzzled me... am I to go the park to ask questions, or have them answered...? I almost spoke to someone while walking...(other than helloing people) only because she cut in front of me to run past me.. I almost turned and sniped back, (as my new runners forged on, good thing)...walk like you drive !!!... But then I would have to assume that she could drive.. and from what I witnessed she looked like she was just having trouble running ! Maybe she wasn't sporting new runners, or her underwear didn't fit... anyways I just kept going. As I continued throughout my day.. I ended up at Safeway. My runners had taken me a number of places.. but that isn't part of this story. So, I am just about to unload my groceries... and this vehicle want to park next to me... so I push the cart forward.. and the vehicle backs up.. and then moves over a bit, parks, opens their doors.. and they proceed to leave. So I am staring at the man and woman that get out of the car.."oh, did I leave you enough room" she asks, "yes, fine" I say... as I continue to watch her every move.... She is clearly looking at me if I am nuts, and the look is reciprocated.... because, what is she leaving in her locked up tight car, on a beautiful hot Sunday afternoon, but two black poodle's IN THE VEHICLE. So I stand there, in silence and watch her hussle away... my feet are getting hot in my new runners... (I have no collar on my shirt today).... So now I am hugely pissed, once again... some stranger adding grey hairs to my colour treated grey haired head. Do I walk away in silence... or do I follow her... my runners were uncertain of a RATIONAL decision... so I slowly put my groceries away.. and then I decided to leave her a note. I thanked her for being considerate about leaving me enough room... but then I asked her to be considerate of not leaving her black dogs, in a sealed vehicle, in the sun on a hot day... now that would be considerate.. oh, and by the way... her front right tire was flat.... and then my runners would not let me leave. I decided to wait and see how long she was gone for... I would say... she was gone for about 10 minutes... and then I saw her coming out of the store.. as she walked up to a mysterious note on her windshield... and that's when my new runners stepped on the gas and took off... because as you know.. I was parked next to her...

      I took my three kids to Tae Kwon Do.. well I only have two, but the third is our good friends.. and she just comes along like she's one of mine... besides I like her... she listens. Anyways, I went to a Black Belt Ceremony this evening. Interesting. I wan't invited, and the kids had to sit through the testing... which was a bit boring... nothing like when my boy first started TKD....anyways, I wanted them to watch the ceremony.. which made me tear up... just the simple words that Master Lee spoke of: your are my son, you are my daughter...and rat ta da ta ta .... and they had to sit on the floor... (NO CHAIRS!!! I DON'T DO FLOORS...) anyways, the parents were invited, and the Black Belts had to do some kind of bowing down, and their face touched the floor, like they were kissing it.. and I wondered to myself.. what are these blackbelts saying in their heads... that "everyone is staring at my behind.. and I am not saying some chant/prayer, but worried about my ass sticking up !!!!" (I was confused about this, and at least had the tact to not ask). All the same, it was interesting, and I wanted my oldest to see it.. because I see my oldest as someone who will become a Black Belt one day.. (not tournament material.. but rather the discipline and self-respect that grows inside) and these fellows (and one girl) are just people that I would like my son to be associated with. And that was it, they all went off to some restaurant for a feast, and we went to Dairy Queen. Raw Raw us!!!

      Well,little Miss Elp came to me this morning in the bathroom... and she sheepishly walks up to me, her eyes still heavy and her little pads all wobbly on the bathroom floor(she was fresh and cozy from a nights sleep in her wicker basket with the mint green ruffled baby blanket liner) .... I wrapped both my hands over her face, and scratched her on the nose. This little piece of affection made her tail wag.. but then again.. just saying her name makes her tail wag. So I took a good look at her... why do you have grey hair I asked her... her tail wagged. Hmm... typical answer coming from you I thought. Her name is L.P., short for Little Pup, and she is a German Shepherd.. she probably has something else in her.... like cat genes... but she looks exactly like a shepherd. We found her on Father's Day, or more like, she came to live with us on that day. Since that time, I have decided she is the oddest dog I have ever come to own. She is more like a cat. So, without delay, I started calling her catdog.. her response.. her tail wagged. She plays with balls with bells, chases string, sleeps on the couch and bed whenever she has the chance, sits on your lap, doesn't like to eat people food, if she could catch a bird she would, and follows you everywhere, she also has a bedtime... and we send her to her basket to go to sleep, otherwise she runs around the house. The only thing she doesn't like is when you try and pick her up. That's when she turns into a nervous nellie, and makes her self very heavy... and skitters away. So, is this what has turned her grey????  Perhaps she is worried about which one of her idiotic human friends will try and pick her up at any point in the day? How is it that dogs go grey... they don't worry about money, employment, a roof over their heads, finding that special partner in life, family planning,  returning to her before married size let alone pre-children size, advanced education, raising children, the environment, communicating effectively with others, or better that, offending others with their own dog-talk, who will care for them when they are old, do they have a retired savings plan, their investment IQ, whether they have friends or not, they don't even care who their parents were !! I think maybe she is just grey simply to do with the fact that she is a dog mixed up with a cats mentality... now that is something to go grey about. D.

      Schools just about done. Heads up for those unaware that there are going to be kids running and screaming everywhere.... the streets are not safe ! Drive in the school zones... you know nobody will be wandering around!! The last week at school has been a nightmare....stay up really late.... don't eat any of the dinners that you have had layed in front of you... because it has been too hot... get up late... maybe eat breakfast with your eyes closed... (that's because your mother dressed you while you were asleep, and made you sleep walk to the table), arrive at school to accomplish mundane tasks of "cleaning".. isn't that what Mothers are hired to do? All of the activites have wound done... Baseball, Piano... even the Tae Kwon Do classes have been shortened.. or is the shortened attention span of the kids that has worn thin on the Master... anyways, he wasn't even their tonight... there's no more playtime with friends after school---because they are all sick of being stuck in a classroom with each other for the past ten months. To top it off, school (for us anyways), doesn't end till Tuesday... a lot of parents failed to read that notice... because a number of them are blowing this post for a new location called "summer vacation". So in jubilation of official summer time... off I went today and bought new tires for our old (14 yrs) vehicle... now these tires were not looking to good.. they looked like they had been driven to one too many Baseball Fields.... aaannnnd...... speaking of treads... I bought some new runners... because the olds ones had blown an air pocket... so, let's have a recap... tires on the truck ready to blow, I went to the dentist today and thought that he was going to blow his drill through my cheek there for a little while, old runners blown, parents have already left on summer vacation, those children left at school are ready to blow in anticipation of summer vacation... oh, and my hose blew the other day. I am glad I do not live in a balloon.

      The clouds have hunted us down..... and have remained steadfast all day. As I was out and about today... people's spirit were brighter; even on our dull day. And that's a good thing. I ventured to the bottle recycling place where I can swear the people there are possessed. But not today... they were actually nice, they actually didn't care that I didn't have things sorted.. they even went as far to help AND say have a good day. Now that I recall everyone I came across today was nice.. how easy is that ???

      So, this grounding thing... it's been a week. I was going to cave, based on the fact that the boy really is a nice sweet kid; and those deep blue eyes with the long lashes don't help me either. I am sure anybody would take him! Now, I did catch the boy mouthing some kind of words to me... nothing that I can lip read... but I have not relented with the no playstation, television, or computer punishment... and I love him more for it.. so this week his room is totally tidy. He cleaned it up tonight... non-stop ( he even stole my new fan in the process he was working so furiously !)...and further to that:   that fan was bought today basically to save my neighbours frog... which I am looking after. It was dropped off yesterday afternoon.... looked fine.. and then I think he got a little hot sitting on our countertop. So of course today I decided that I couldn't be responsible for killing my neighbours frog... because I don't think she really likes me even on a good day.. so I immediately thought a fan (that came with a remote control!)would be the answer to all the frogs problems... and mine. But now.. at this hour... myself and the frog are fanless. NO worries, although I drive in the front seat... I will take the backseat for the children.. !...now if only I can get that fan back !!

      There was once a time when I would wake up... and not even consider the thought of coffee. Now there isn't a moment when I can think of an excuse not to have coffee. Is there a reason why I love to drink black water? You know if I was passing a pothole... and saw black murky water.... ooohhh yuk, would be the first thoughts from me... But to see it neatly in a cup, not only do I want to drink it, but I want to add cream to it as well.

      For the first time in a (seemingly)large number of months, the clothes are folded AND put away. Yes, it's true. Of course that does not include the ones that are still in the washing machine waiting to be washed, those are automatically excluded due to the fact that they still have dirt attached to them. Secondly I am not including the "unknowns".. meaning the pieces of laundry that are lost in people's bedrooms......well of course there is already "tomorrows" clothes that will arrive in the morning, I'm not counting those either. Laundry magically appears.. and why is that?? Is it because of our obligations to other matters in life that divert our attention? Why is it that laundry consumes much of our thoughts..... somedays I judge how good my day has been in accordance to the amount of laundry I have tended to... along with the other errands that happen in life,... but don't seem to count, or get forgotten. I was at work for the greater part of the day, picked up kids, took one to physio, vacuumed, did dishes, kind of made dinner, collected and took out the recycling, practiced the piano...and for the first time in a long while.... there was no more baseball. Hence; the grand fold unfolded before my eyes ....and why.... without obligations.

      A day WITHOUT.... blogging, televisions, Playstations, computers, hissing about practicing the piano, staying indoors. Unbelievable.... and we are all alive today even though they went without this yesterday. Unbelievable... I am going to have to ground the boy for the rest of his life.... he actually listens, and I thought he had a hearing problem. He is actually willing to help accomplish tasks... and I thought he was just being defiant. I think perhaps my boy acting like a little shit the other night was the best thing that happened to him..... because taking everything he loves to do away from him... is actually making him do more... and he is still alive to boot. But, now I have the girl to contend with.....and that's a whole new paragraph. D.

      So, off I go to TKD, only 2 kids to night. The girl was a bit growly about going, but once we got their.. she disappeared into the gym. There, done. But then the boy... took over my "eyesight". Tonight he was the highest belt in the class. But of course he failed to realize that he was also required to act his rank, and perhaps even better maybe his age. That's where things came to a crashing halt. The little shit persisted on talking, and talking and talking, oh, and did I mention that he talked the whole way through class. So, if he wasn't talking, then he wasn't even paying attention, and if he wasn't paying attention, then he wasn't even kicking correctly (well he never kicks correctly... lets just say bothering to kick at all) is more the term. I stood up waved my finger to smarten up... They had a 2 minute water break and I waved him over to me.. I was the only parent there.. I was even evil enough to say to him, that he was acting very offensively (STUPID!!!!!...but I didn't say that to him), and he needed to stop. I told him, knock it off, pay attention and act responsibly. So lets get that straight I said to him:   sldfjsd l sdkf; ads ;i ;oi3 [3qw;lsd ; vm;asdf ;aasf'q;wl ka;'fa;fk3pwg;'erpwr   a opwe adfalfk f'awr a;sdf aw';AIK ASDLFK WEa eog'dfifg'K VEKAE'RK Q;WFK'a;roep3pweiw'rak;db'dfth6yortyi95 arja;opwriae'fkas;'kwepagoei w4arpo w4tp  aret w aewr;k3aisy gagfdlbxcvc, bsdfgw sd ';a ';k ktlj poi 'd f ;l akeakf ;kwe poaga'sdlfg a;lk ltka ia g; maw asdj w t pw etasorkj aeprog idrg ;asld as;lk peotu4[rou qw asdfladrgjweiout' asg aoerk aerpgik wrtuiap[ w3k'qw4i areg trhpoer oy50y4309682304iregierh[l [prt [po y-0r 9i-e5   .......Yes that's right.. That's what I said to him exactly... which is exactly how he behaved. I was livid.. furiously livid... disgustingly furiously livider.....  I think I even had the black belt fellow who was teaching the class very frightened of me !!! So we get in the car.... and first things out of my mouth... no playstation, no television, no computer. Boom. Done. I am the evil one. Stupid stupid behaviour.... which come with stupid stupid consequences... 2 weeks worth of consequences... well, it's a good thing that the scholastic book order came in today... he certainly will get a lot of reading done.  Now lets recap the day.. I had a lesson in weed killers, which I will never even buy again... I guess I bought them by mistake the first time... nor should anyone buy this stuff.!!!!! Then I finally invested in a laminant floor mop (it's been 2 years now that we have had our floor... and I am just thinking about this now... )... I used other methods of cleaning. Of course that was quite silly, because today as I started to mop.. man was I happy. It was almost a pleasure to clean these floors !!!! I better not type that too boldly... someone might find out. Then the nephew came over... all hands on deck... all hands on deck... now this kid is a destroyer... you have to keep your eyes peeled on this little guy. ( So I quickly finished cutting the front lawn.. before the house started sinking ). Oh, then I cleaned out the kitchen sink... I was trying to see how high I could stack our dishes in just one sink.... while leaving the other sink empty !!! So, a rather odd game, didn't last long.. fixed that little psychotic problem ! Vacuumed everywhere, cleaned the bathroom, didn't have to do the boys laundry (yea... it's been three days now)...oh back up... cut the back lawn until the lawnmower ran out of gas... walked away from that problem.. I just hate filling that little tank.. I am notorious for spilling the gas.. no matter how careful I am..... then the sis came to pick up little nephew... no disasters today... we were lucky.... off to get the kids... oh, and then the boy had a hair cut... I am going to have to stop going to that place... the people are weird. Yes, let's leave it at that. Just weird. The boy ended up with more hair around his face, than off his head... I said to him he needed a shave !!! The girl needed to be fed when we got their..she was almost psychotic that she needed food so bad...  so I got her a subway sandwhich... they're on special on Tuesdays.. so I got one for boy ....he'd be hungry in about five minutes anyways... a couple of bites into the sandwhich... her personality changed... for the better... put a smile on my face. Once home, with happy people, and short haired people... I decided to kind of gut my laundry room.... got lots accomplished... but then had to leave to go to Tae Kwon Do.... and it went down hill from the their.. no point rehashing that scene.. but now, it is 9:42... the boy is at the table colouring some scooby doo pictures.. he has two weeks marked off on the kitchen calendar... this might work... but it's only the first day. He might even start to listen after today.....

      Some days this computer land is quite amazing... I have been fighting with buttons the last couple days... I wanted to add a picture in this thing... I just couldn't figure out how to do it.. and I kept on fiddling with it until I figured it out !!!!     The girl was with me when I took the picture below... she was in love with this lovely shaggy animal... the odd part is.. she's an absolute carnivore... every day at dinner she wants to know where her meat is.. and when will it be coming.... or why do I not have any meat for her today. I'd think she'd take the timeto become a vegetarian, because she absolutely loves Tofu as well. Is it okay to love both... ???? How can you love a bean as much as you can love a cow.. when the husband brings the "meat" in from the BBQ, the first question out of her mouth is "Is that my cow... is it cooked, and can I eat it all? Thata girl.    The Boy had his last ball game.. can't say I'm sad... what do you do when he stands one third base and quietly sings to himself, does a jig, catches a ball, throws it back, and then continues to sing and gaze at the colours and formations of the clouds... ummm boy, we're playing in this field tonight son... I call out to him. One day he'll get it together.. I hope !

      So, it's the end of the day... and the kids are asleep... the dogs are locked in their designated spots, without a peep. I sit alone in the kitchen, and pluck away at these keys... nattering away at whatever I please.   So I've decided that Costco is the place that keeps me connected with odd people... as I walked along, this women and I had a conversation about life in parking lots.. and as we entered Costco we went our separate ways. Then... it happened again.. I had a box of chips (the stuff in the  goodie bags type, for the girl's birthday party)anyways, I wandered up to the checkout with my one lone box. So the lady in front of me looks at me, then looks at my lone item ... and then immediately averts her eyes in another direction... the whole time I willed her to look back at me... I almost thought about waving my one box at her, and just say HI. It's nice to be nice to people who going out of their way to not be nice to you. So I waited........ think nice thoughts, think nice thoughts, think nice thoughts... I said to myself as I stood in line... maybe the lady doesn't know about courtesy items.. you know the quick dive in front with the one item... but the invitation has to come from the person who is the person at the head of the line.. so it never came... and poof... all of a sudden a costco girl opened up the line right beside me... and I never saw it coming... so there I was, next in line to buy my one box of chips.. as I walked past the lady still in line... I smiled, and waved my box of chips...  The girls party went very well. I am glad it is done. Well except for the fact that almost everyone showed up at about 1:15..... I am certain that the two invitations I wrote out had 1:00 written on it. All the same... it's all about making the pink princess happy... and she kicked and punched and ran around and broke her already broken board... as they all did, and seemed to enjoy it. I have a feeling the only reason the kids actually come is so that they can take home a goody bag... now I'd like to know the person that invented these little numbers as I am sure has already lost their life... because I know there are many people around the world that would take this person out... if they knew who it was !!!!!! Why do we have goodie bags.... there has to be an answer/reason. A simple thanks is all it takes... do we then send a note back thanking for the goodie bag... and the goodie bag recipient then sends a note back.. when does it stop... before you know it.. we have posties all over the country running to peoples mail boxes with little envelopes... UPS people no longer carry parcels... but carry cute little cards.... I can see the stars crashing and galaxies colliding because of the goodie bag hassle. I wont be the first person to stop... I don't want all the kids looking at me as the evil mother that refused to follow the leader in this instance !!!! You know.. I have things to do.. but I am just not going to do them...because this is Sunday... and I don't do things that I am supposed to do on Sundays.... somehow I give myself a day off from obligations, and because it's now 1045.. and I have missed Real Renos.. and I love these two guys that are on camera... because they are so REAL! With a hug and kiss, and a whisper good night... See you in the morning as I shut both their doors tight. D.

      I survived another day at work. Nothing too extreme.. the phone was annoying, the people I worked with were great, I didn't have any hysterical departments calling me about useless notations about how things should be done. We even bought a bunch of 649's.... hey... instead of writing this I should be checking numbers... always in the wrong place ! Well, the boy is insistent that I watch some BC Mysteries show... I may learn something,.. better go..... Not a bad show... interesting to hear about CANADIAN history for a change. I have decided that I am a friend loser. Not in the true sense of the words before me, but rather a person that makes friends... just to lose them. I have had so many people wander in and out of my life.. I am surprised I have kept the same husband for the last 13 years !!! I don't even want to begin to recall the friends/faces that I have said good-bye to. The last one just moved to Ontario.. I will never see her again. The next time I begin making friends with someone, I will hand out an application... where are your from.. and do you have any interest in leaving... if so... move on to the next person !!! The invention of this e-mail has been remarkable in  maintaining a wirefilled friendship... Ontario has swallowed up a number of my pals... they eventually stopped writing/calling... but now.. these people are still at my finger tips ! Hooray ! There are some days that I just begin to talk.. and the fingers pound out stories and anecdotes that are simply... beyond help !!!  So, back to today.. and work. The moons must be in the correct positions for me right now.. because the wierdness factor that follows me... has simply come to a crashing hault. Which is highly odd for me... like I have written before I am the magnet of all magnets for wierd people finding me... if someone is out there and has a stupid question to ask... and I will say.. people do ask stupid questions... they will duck the 5 booths before them claiming "Ask the Stupid Question Here!!"... Noooooo, the will dodge the line and find me... although.. now that the memory is warming up.. I did tell a lady today in about a dozen different ways what time her husband would be back from his test. I wasn't quite certain how many times you can say... he left 15 minutes ago, and the procedure generally takes about 45 minutes, so he will be back in a hour. I am just not certain... how many ways can you tell a person the same information.. without it getting very confusing after a while !! I almost got confused.. that last time I did the math.. if you have 45 minutes and then you add 15 minutes.. it usually adds up to an hour... but maybe with all this new math now.. maybe it's something different !!! So I had a fairly boring day at work... I have decided that I will never quit my job... since I have been working almost every single Saturday since the invention of Saturdays.. I would probably breakdown, because I wouldn't know what to do with myself for the 12 hour portion of the day.... I could never go to the mall... because there would be lineups.. and I don't do lineups... someone with a fuse as long as mine... is not allowed to do lineups... I mean a millimetre is just that ... one millimetre.. and that is the fuse that I own. I tried exchanging it once... but of course ... their was a line-up.. and all the longer fuses were already taken.. there were just shorter ones left. So I knew to leave a good thing alone !!!! Besides... I think I have a longer fuse than my sister. That already is a good thing... Now that I have thought back on the day.. I have already claimed to have a good day.. it was the people around that I got to witness having all their wierd moments... since I am a people watcher and all.... (with a bit of a memory lapse issue !!) There was this kind of strange... no wait a minute, that's giving her too much credit, she was bloody strange... and with an attitude to boot. Some woman from Occupational Health and Safety came to fit the nurses with TB masks.. she was just so abrupt. She didn't get two words past me before I shut her down.. it was before eight in the morning, and she was barking out orders... I'm sorry, who are you again??? Of course that just frosted her pony tail !!!!  Interesting, I bought a bowl of "Hearty" chicken noodle soup from the, I guess, awful little coffee shop downstairs... I was kind of chuckling at lunch, as I peered through the yellow murky liquid to the bottom of the styrofoam bowl, and found one rotini like noodle, and a tiny chunk of chicken, my guess is, it got in their by accident.. or all the hearty soup eaters made it to lunch before me...those lucky people ! Maybe next week will be my turn for the hearty soup... today I could have saved my money, boiled up the kettle, and added... let me see what's yellow on our unit.. well orange juice would have worked... I'll have to remember that for next week. Tomorrow is the girls birthday party. I sort of put together a party for her. The guest list was a bit of an issue. She has had the absolute misfortune this year in being a class that has evil little children in it. I want to know... was I that nasty when I was 6 and 7 years old... I couldn't possibly have been.. I mean I let people walk all over me now... and I am kind of old.. I probably didn't even notice when I was that age. Anyways, I let her invite the kids that she went to parties to, or that she talked about.. ok, so the kids came from the first list. I must have asked her 3,4,5,6,7,8... times... do you want to invite... @@#@#$%^... no, not her... no thanks. So now, I have had 2 cancellations, 1 mother that simply didn't give me an answer when I gave her another invitation... because I had to change the time, after I had given them the first invitation.. thank goodness for computers !!... and I haven't heard from one set of parents.. and the thing is... I had to give out invitations twice in one week... they had my phone number and e-mail.. and still no response. Oh, and the other is who she claims is her best friend in her class... she speaks Korean.. so do her sisters, so does her mother... so, I had to call and talk to her on the phone... which is silly.. because I can only count to ten in Korean... and tell you what a round-house kick is, or say thank you grand master for teaching us... I'm working on the limited Korean lingo here.. ... but then I started talking food.. and the mother new right away where it was that she was to go... I mean I was beginning to get desperate for party kids... I couldn't take the chance to lose another one.. I was even thinking of calling the Grand Master from the kids Tae Kwon Do school to talk to her !!! We'll see tomorrow if all my slow english speaking ways help... because of course I know that you can totally understand another language if you speak it really really slowly... !!!! oh,,, and I tried not to yell... that helps with getting the words to stick in your head... I can't wait one day to travel to Korea.. I am certain they will speak slowly to me and yell. I will pick it up in a matter of hours I am sure..... well, my day had been more than this, but this is all that I care to type about.. what I really want to do is go play my candle in the wind.. I photocopied the music today, so it is much smaller, since I have taken the bookshelf out of the living room, it is hard to attach the six foot long string of music to the side of the bookcase, and then balance the other edge of the paper on the sill of the door. Perhaps this complete brainwave will help. Over and out, D.

      I have just retyped all the info that could be spilled from my fingertips through the keyboard and onto this page..... just to not have it saved... a tad bit annoying... because my neck does not cooperate at this late hour... it apparantley is a bit tired.. and then decides to have a hissy fit about sitting here.... maybe that is telling me something... either I am a very bad typist... or I have been at this too long. Well, the chicklets are in bed... and I need to do a scholastic order, make some lunches, fold some laundry, set the coffee maker, decide what I am wearing to work tomorrow, and do a crossword puzzle (that is helping me keep my brain functioning adequately), and it is now 10 to 11. Hmmm......something isn't going to get done. I have had a fairly quiet day.. nothing odd to report... because on a daily basis something odd happens... I am still waiting for the Ocean Front Lottery to publish the winning tickets... because every year I purchase a ticket... just to win nothing.... you'd think I'd learn after a little while..... well, I have put off the inevidable long enough...

      I am most interested by the way people conduct themselves (via mannerisms), and their made up self-importance! I think I am missing the boat on that one! I am waiting for my important self to show up... in the meantime I will continue to wander through life, and enjoying other people's self-importance, while trying to dissect what it is that makes them think this as so. It reminds of a day at "Costco".. and sometimes I just don't think, I am positive it has happened to most people out there... anyways, I was standing in line, and then I thought Oh Crap... I forgot something... so I stepped out of my turn in the long never-ending lines at "Costco"... and as I left the line... I said outloud Oh rats.. forget it... so I turned my cart around.. and boom... the lady that had been standing behind me pushed her cart in front of me......so what do you do???? I stood their, watching and waiting... just to see if she would back up... she saw me turn around... because I saw her... and yet... when I moved my cart back into line, she wouldn't move back..... I waited in amazement... I admired her self-control, and her importance, that she did not have to be a polite respectful person, that her time was far more valuable than mine... so.... I stood their staring at the back of her head... waiting to see if she would turn around ever so slightly.... it never happened. And that's when I knew she knew that she was being awful... so I wished the same with the rest of her day.... of course only in my head !!!

      I tell ya... putting together birthday parties is just too much !!! When does it end, when is it enough... I was wondering through the grocery store.. and thinking in my head... what is it that I need... where will I find it... and when I do will it be enough? The other side of the story is that people do not RSVP... is that a word from the past??? Do people not get it... I want to hear from them!! I think I've accounted for almost everything I need to do for the Party.. except the food.... pizza will work.. now it's a question if the little people will eat it!!!

      Hey, this is kind of great... a real life diary... my friend put me on to this... so I thought I would start now.. I should have started a diary/editorial many many moons ago, so today is as good a day to start. Rightnow I am waiting to see if I won something from the Oceanfront Home Lottery, clearly I didn't win the title of this lottery... so I am settling on something WAY smaller, much to my dismay. The website has toldme they would have winning numbers here by today... and here I am still waiting... you know I am the kind of person that would be dead if I was a cat. There is always something to be thankful for !! Well, since it is still early in the day, I have to go and find the kitchen table, fold the laundry, make dinner, con my 9 year old to practice his piano before we have to leave for his baseball game, and then find my wasy to his last piano lesson.

      I thought I had children... but I do not.... I have two young boxers... a 7 year old with a left hook, and a 9 /12 year old with a right hook.  Today they visited unannounced and displayed their fine talents for the nice babysitter girl from next door.... I owe her lots of money.... or a can of pop... some chocolate... how about just a bag of sugar, a big bag of chips... or some gift certificates for a fast food place .....I am going to have to think fast... because she is coming back tomorrow for an even longer day with them..... I hope my children return in time for her to look after them... they quite like her.

         Ma Ma !!!! Ma Ma !!!!!   So Missy Lou-who woke up this morning screaming her fool head off ! I enter into the "Pip's Toy Palace Where Every Move Could Be Your Last Move".... she is locked beneath her lavender duvet cover with her face smashed into her pillow... and she is fast asleep. I'm looking at her and she is definitely fast asleep.... all of a sudden her eyes pop open... and she magically bolted out of her bed - BOOM - like a stick of dynamite - and into our bed she goes.... Pip, Pip are you in their.... as she settles in our bed... she barks.... "Put the TV on for me".....No fear, Pip is here. I wasn't quite sure what the whole deal was... but she had been momentarily locked in fright.......too bad she couldn't stay that way the whole day.... the babysitter was coming !

      I'd love to write an anecdote from today.. but I thought I would give the weary readers some time to breath... besides..... I did the best thing today... I talked to some of my friends on the phone today.. which of course takes up lots of time... because believe it or not  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S H O C K  &nbsp; I like to talk... but then so do my friends... so it's equal............. anyways... the real reason for the non-writing this evening is that I have this book.. which I really AM NOT enjoying reading.... but I have to finish it... isn't that a law somewhere..??? So on that note... I will find where ever my girl has hidden herself... tuck her in to her very messy girly room..... leave Mr Sportswatcher in the den, and I am sure the boy will make it home... sometime tonight... afterall he is afraid of the dark.&nbsp;&nbsp;   --O

      This girl of mine now rides two wheels. She has for a while..but the King-dad-bike-guy never took them off. I take them out for a bike ride yesterday, the safety boy brought his water bottle... in case of dehydration issues, it only took him TWENTY MINUTES to fill it up. So, who heard me yelling COOOOMMMMMMEEEEEEEE OOOOOOONNNNNNNNN...&nbsp; to him? As far as I know here in big BC, especially in little Port Coquitlam... we have very good water pressure....although safety boy can magically change that scenario. WE start to ride... the girl is instantly gone... leaving us in her purple dust... and she's riding and talking.... like turning her head around and talking at myself and Mr Safety... uh Pip... could you just turn around and ride.. I call out to her. We kind of rode forever along the dike.....we were almost at a stopping point, when she decides she's had enough, and turns around to head for home. Say Pip.... who's the adult here....you are supposed to stay with me. She says "No, this is far enough, you are going to drive straight into that bridge over their... so I'm turning around and going back home, besides, I need to get to that secret trail". Luckily I had a treat for&nbsp;Her Royal Beastiness. We head for home... but first we spot a snake....&nbsp;Mr Safety stays a safe 10 feet away... and begins to tell The Pipster to stay back.... not her... her and her purple roadster ride right up to it. "I love that guy!!! she yells.... "Look how fast he moved... I think I want&nbsp;a snake of my own!!" she says.&nbsp;Mr Safety comes to investigate after the snake is long&nbsp;gone. &nbsp;WE leave and once again we ride in purple dust. Along comes this hill that leads to the secret trail... so I say to the Pip... slow down... get off y.-----bi-------e.. OKAY...... don't get off you bike... you just keep going girl.... see how fast you can really go BEFORE YOU FLY OFF THAT PURPLE POWER MACHINE OF YOURS !!!! Ya hoo !!!! she starts yelling... " Ma ma... Ma ma'.. did you see how fast I went... I thought you were going to tell me to slow down... but I just wanted to see how fast I could go!" (Yes that's right Pipster... oh little girl with a pleated summer skirt, sandles and a matching spaghetti strap shirt...yes, there would have been nothing left of you..... and definitely a good experiment..... so have I written about my hair colour that says permanent.. with no fading.... well it's not doing what it's supposed to... I am not certain if it has anything to do with the hair colour at all...... or it might have something to do with the Purple Dust Creator.) WE continue on home... the whole while she's clipping along on her "magic purple machine", and Safety Boy is busy hissing about looks at what she's doing.. I can't believe that.... why does she do that.... make her stop that... she's going to hurt herself....she's such an embarassment....please be silent and ride Mr Safety.... Today, once again lady Pip took the Purple Power out for another spin... first to the park so she could go swimming... and then she pleads with me.. to go the long way home... what ever Pip... and off we go. I'm walking, she's riding. And that was that.... so... I'll see you at home K Ma Ma. Umm, once again... Pip... you are with me... remember... kids stay with adults... hey Pip... did you hear me...Pip.... kids stay with adults.... PIP !!!..... I call out to her as she cruises around the corner, waves.... "I'll see you at home"..... oh well.... I just keep walking along. When I reach the trail... their she is. Bike laying in the dust.. her sitting on a barricade. Well Pip... what happened here... I look.... her knee has been busy bleeding for a while. WE dump a bunch of water on it... she rides home.... where she proceeds to go in the house... clean it out.. find some bandaids.. comes back out... and wants to go riding with her friends. PIP ------ NO !!!!!

      It is the sound of my remote controlled fan whiring away, and the echos of televisions sets. That's it. How does one acquire such a sound..... take your children to the lake where they swim for 3 hours straight in the boiling heat. I think I am going to crown myself !! Too late.... that crowning moment is over... The Pipster has made her way to me......this could be trouble.

      So, last night I wake the girl from her deep slumber.... that was taking place in our bed. "Come on little girl.... wake up... let's take you back to your bed..... "... with my guidance she starts to move.... I walk her out of our room... and was closing in on her bedroom.... when JAWS attacks. Hey... she's trying to bite me... eeek... the girl was just wandering along in her sleepfilled state when all of a sudden her eyes see my forearm as a midnight snack... and she lunges. Yikes... I remove my limbs from the Miss Great Whites view.. and she carries on into her bed... I had to lift her in... well her and her BRAND NEW too-big-to-be-for-real-blue-and-pink UNICORN. I attempted to buy her&nbsp;an "EDUCATIONAL" item while I was out... but she spotted this beast... and that was it..instantly her COTTON CANDY Unicorn was a need for the day. &nbsp;Meanwhile...the boy got a book, a funny book, he was happy with his funny book. So happy that he needs to read me all the funny captions. ALL THE TIME. Funny boy reading funny captions... suddenly things are not so funny anymore !!!!

       I have had a couple more thoughts...   The kids are going to be pissed tomorrow when I wake them up early, and we make our way to the Town Centre Stadium track where they can watch me walk in circles and "hiss" about being away from their home.  They are taking this day of "nothing" on the calender a little too seriously.  My children will never be able to join the swim team, because you have to be their at 0530... yes that's in the morning.... I can just imagine what words they would have for me then.  I am going to become my own swim team... and I will wear a green suit, kind of a secret blogger code kind of thing... that should be good.  The boy wanted to know how long "that dish cleaning thing" ran for.... the only reason being that he wanted it&nbsp;for his favourite red cereal bowl. Looks like he wont be eating today.  My girl has changed from her Cinderella dress into a house marm dress. She won't be going out today....   Oh, on the weathergirl front... I believe what I am witnessing happening in the skies above me is "SMOG". I would hesitate to guess that's what it is... although I am hardpressed to see it right over my head... even though I know it's there... I usually see the "bulk" of it sitting on the horizon..... I will be making my application to weathergirl school sooner than I thought with that realization...  I wonder about this Blogger World I have entered into.... did I really have all these thoughts before... and I never wrote them down....and now that I write them.... do people actually read them... and if they do... shouldn't I have made this a little more anonymous?  Oh, and lastly... I like Michael Smyth... he writes the neatest things about goverment issues.......&nbsp;I would like to thank the Liberal Government&nbsp;for&nbsp;being divided over the issue&nbsp; about whether or not they will build ferries in British Columbia. They are willing to let $500 million dollars&nbsp;"slip" out of the province to be given to Germany or Finland for building ferries for us. Who ever can build them the fastest and the cheapest. Never mind the fact that it will generate 2000 jobs in BC, and result in $75 million dollars in tax revenue given to three levels of government, and other money making spinoffs. Thanks once again for being divided over the issue... I certainly know I would be.

        It's July 27th... and for the first time this month... there isn't something to do...Yae. that won't last long.  So far this morning the boy has done what he was told....from last night. To sleep in. That boy of mine listens, he did just that.  I have been (OCDish like) staring at the sky.. I haven't been able to come up with the colour of the clouds that have floated into this hemisphere. Maybe I have become immune to seeing colour... the sky has been blue for so long, and with the constant heat beating down... all I can visualize is the colour blue. Hmmm... if I think hard enough it's like a high cloud yellowy&nbsp; greyish/whitish film that has overtaken us..(kind of like the colour that emerges after washing dishes while camping!).. and somehow the sun is still able to creep through.... there are shadows present....would that be a filtered light Deanna? I can't wait to make it into "Weatherlady School"  The girl is dressed in a long gown, looking lovely for this morning non-events. She asked if she could have a blond wig.... not sure why... because she owns one... which is attached to her head.  I am hoping that I will be on time for TKD (Tae Kwon Do) at 6:30 tonight. It could be a tight squeeze though. Ha !!  The total blog the same as mine has been increased to 5. (thanks to those outthere... sending me info.. you know who you are... someday maybe you can join me at my news station... I'll be the &nbsp;weathergirl... and you can be reporters!!!!)  I need to go... my home telephone is calling me... (I know this because a computer screen pops up...&nbsp;and it had my phone number attached... and to think I was already typing... I am such a multitasker.. I can type to myself, and talk to myself on the phone at the same time). Wow

      I can't end the day without a thought or two not&nbsp;passed on about the Pip. The Princess Queen Almighty One Herself deserves to be spoken about... I guess. &nbsp;So the day started off bumpy.. immediately hungry... which makes her grumpy. Crapola, I think to myself.... nice Monday to me. I feed the beastly little hound her bagels and smoked salmon cream cheese, while she lounged on the green leather couch..... just keep chewing sweet girl.... next on the to-do list was school work. She has a huge stack of "whatever" to work through. So I invite the little beast to the table. Bad move. By this time the boy is already sitting at the table talking numbers.... and she wants to do words. Bad move, because it's a bad mix.... numbers and words.... hmmmmm.... she does a page... with my constant help......I think to myself.. should I just take the pencil and do this for you... but I manage to restrain myself from that parental infraction. I could tell by the way she was leaving about three inches of lead dust&nbsp;all over the page that this mornings school work&nbsp;would be cut short.... five simple questions... and at that she almost snapped her most beautiful barbie pencil in half.... I gave her the evil mother stare-dare.... she settled.... in the den to watch TV. Not what I had hoped... but happy to still&nbsp;be alive.. so there's always a compromise... meanwhile Mr. Numberboy was still doing addition facts... later.... I managed to get her hair washed... because I was still calling her "Missy Lakehead" from being at camp last week. (Our weekend was a bit too busy and she never had the chance to be soaped and lathered and hopefully cleaned). Once again... I came out of it alive. That's two for two. We went to the dentist... to of course get the Pip's teeth filled again. She hissed for a while after we left... that "The Dentist Guy" made her teeth hurt.... but now she was pissed that her nose was itchy.... and she was going to scratch if off....IF I DIDN'T DO SOMETHING RIGHT NOW !!!!!!! Well, Miss Pip... rub your nose... that way it will stay on your face, was the only suggestion I came up with.&nbsp; &nbsp;We did a couple of errands... the whole while she wandered around with me... can I get something, I want something, can you buy me this,this is what I want,&nbsp;I like this, will you get it, I need it, this is what I want, I will not be quiet until you get me something. I looked her straight in the eye.."Get this.... you get nothing" Don't even try to hiss at me..... the whole while Mr Reading Boy sits, and reads. &nbsp;The day proceeds... then she decides that its Purple Power Sonic Boom Hour... and wants to start riding her bike. Alright Miss. Out we go.. and I watch her FLY up and down our street on her purple bike. Her pink helmut on crooked, only one pom-pom coming out of her handle bars, in a pink dress and pink sandles, training wheels kicked up high on the sides of the bike, as she hoots and hollers the whole way down the street... MA MA... she screams.... I just love it when I go fast... this is great!!!&nbsp; I think, "I am frightened... I am still alive.... but I am frightened". Later tonight.... while the boy and I were out walking.... Mr Biker Repair Man came out of retirement to put a new tire on my bike that he had taken off... who knows how long ago. Then I hear her, before I can even see her......"HEY, look at this.. what looks different.... can you see me.... what do you think???.......what am I missing ?????" The girl had her training wheels taken off. Nice. She hasn't used them in how long... but they remained on to what.... continuously bruise and bash her legs. "That's great Pip"... so now that both of the bikes had some minor repairs... we take the bikes out for a quick ride.... she goes belting down the road..... just to have a black cat cross her path... Lucky Girl or what??!!!!

      The boy and I went for a walk tonight. He asked me if I had a bike. Yes son, I own a bike, but King Daddy Bike Repair Man needs to do something with it so I can ride. So we'll just walk. The boy was in a walking mood...did I&nbsp;say walking... I think I mispelled... it was more like a talking mood. &nbsp;I am not certain what moved more... his feet or his face. He never stopped talking, not once.. ever... at all, I can still hear his little voice echoing in my head... even as I sit here madly clicking the keys... he is still talking to me.... and he's in the other room, watching TV. Hmmm.  So... we finally made it home... I think we were gone for an hour and a half, and he says to me... "OH, I see Daddy is out front fixing your bike (AAAAhhh dream come true !!!!)....and I am thinking next time we go... we should ride... that way  YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO&nbsp;STOP AND SEE&nbsp;ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS THAT YOU BUMP INTO, AND DO ALL KINDS OF TALKING ".   I have no freaking idea what him and I talked about for the last few hours... all I know is that he talked... now my next fear is that we talked about something.. that of course he will remember and I clearly wont... and he will recall it and bring to my attention... and I wont have a clue... I think I should be getting worried. He's right... next time we'll ride..... Helmuts and a mouthguard. (For the two of us)

       I hate ants!!! I really, really hate ants.  Especially when they start marching through my cupboards. The little super-sonic-strengthed shits. Get out of my house&nbsp; little ants..... I am off to defend my territory loaded with peppermint extract, cotton balls, my cheese grater&nbsp;and the Pipster's sidewalk chalk. (She doesn't know that I am slowly depleting her colourful world of sidewalk chalk). I am evil.... when it comes to ants! I am going to post a sign.... "No Picnicing Here".... that should work.

      Many things can happen on a weekend. Like loads of laundry that appear in your laundry room. I have no idea how they make it their but they do... and then the Magic Maid comes along and takes care of it... I wonder who that is??? Then of course there's Gardening Girl that makes her way into the yard in the early AM to water all the flowers, and plants. I get along with her quite nicely ! She's welcome at any time at my house... but then there's Weeding Woman, she's similar to Garden Girl, those two get along famously.. and then there's the Soaker Chick. She generally hangs out in the front yard... soaking all the flowers and such. After spending time in the great outdoors... all the personalilites welcome themselves to the great indoors... and that's when Flora the Folder shows up... she unloads what the Laundry Lady has done.. and folds all of those items. But not to be outdone, Vera VonVacuum stops by for a visit. Once she shows up... then she has a great following that like to hang out with her.... Daisy the Duster, Wilma dafilmer-remover likes to hang out in the bathroom, then there's Lady Laminent-Cleaner that always has to pay a visit with Vera VonVacuum. Now you would think that playing hostess to all of these fine individuals that Cara&nbsp;Foracoffee would pay a visit or&nbsp;Ms. Squarebaker. But no, these fine inidividuals are never to be found.... they are quickly pushed out of the kitchen by Mr. Cleanandtidy. This guy stops by on the weekends only, and hangs around long enough to censor all kitchen activities, and put a stop to any form of clutter creation. Damn that&nbsp;Mr. Clean.   So, other things that have happened..... tell me if I was too evil. ( I am hoping that I won't have to answer this myself...) My boy was happily watching TV in our room, keeping cool and just being quiet on this Sunday afternoon. His friend knocked on the door, and asked if he could play, sure, and out he goes. Not more than a minute later.. he comes in, in a tizzy and on the verge of tears. I ask him what's wrong. His buddy set him up. .... No sooner did the boy go outside and start talking to his "friend" when the across the road boy come running out.. and beam him in the head with a HUGE water balloon. Nice, real nice. So the TWO friends are still standing outside waiting for my boy... I don't know.. but they get me instead. And I just freak. "What do you two think you are doing???? How would you like it, if the boy came to your door, and thumped you with a water balloon... it would be different if he had been playing with you.... but he wasn't... do you even think this was nice..!!!!????? Apologize now! The one boy starts to smirk... and I hiss at him.... whipe that smile from your face.. what both of you did was cruel, and you should both be ashamed of yourselves... and you guys call yourselves friends of my boy..... well you are not... now get lost !!!! Slam. I can't stand kids.   Oh, we got to go to the Molson Indy... our friends gave us tickets... well I think they were just trying to get rid of us coming over for a BBQ on the Saturday night... it was soooo freaaakiiing HOT down their...... I was practically dead... then I had to whip to go and BUY something to take with us... which I despise doing... because I like to MAKE things when I go to people's houses. Meanwhile.... the husband watered the dogs.. and had a shower himself... as I was running all over town buying drinking and eating things !!!! I was baked.... and not burnt baked... just baked from being out in the roasting heat... but I had fun watching the beautiful loud cars whip past me. Never been before, will never go again, never ever wanted to go, but I was thrilled to be able to go.   Oh, I  wanted  to write something yesterday.....but it was soooooo freaking hot that it came out something like this....&nbsp; my fingers were sticking to the keyboard    &nbsp; ;alsjar; orit fkvaslkgealkfj d;klj w;t egp]&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  TRANSLATION:   Help I am melting .

      Fourth day of camp for the kids... fourth day of freedom for me. Yae. Exept that leaves me with time, time to find "things" to fill my blank canvas with... time for me to connect thoughts and ideas in my head.... this is just not safe. First I have to write:   I have to admire those out there (????), who are notably writing all about their political views and theories. I seem to come across them quite frequently. &nbsp;Good for you. In fact today... I found a website that had a template that was the&nbsp;exact same as mine. Mind you this is a borrowed template and all... but there are so many "out there" I rarely see duplicates... except.... the one I read today had a whole political thing on it.... clearly not mine. I am not polilticaly minded... and I wonder what it takes to become one.. except that, that type of info doesn't find its way into my head... I hear about... and then its gone. Oh, and the other thing.. they (the people witht the same template as myself) had a baby today as well!!! Congratulations to all of you,&nbsp;whoever you are.   I dropped the kids off today, and went to go get gas... since the prices have dropped to a mere 81.9 cents a litre.... (but considering I am willing to pay a dollar fifty for a cup of 12oz&nbsp;coffee that gets me where????? It's not so bad). So I drive in, to the self-serve... I am too cheap to have someone pump my gas.. and there's cars and people.... but nobody seems to be moving. Alright, this is interesting.&nbsp; I sit and wait. I begin to doubt where I am and what time zone I've entered into..... and don't do this to a woman that has the whole day to herself...it's only going to make begin to think wild thoughts to write about.... and no sooner did I think it... .then it all began to unfold. Little Lady Slowmotion came out of the Chevron doors, and stopped. Stopped and looked around..... as if she had lost her car at this place...."it's not the mall" I start screaming in my head. She begins to fumble inside her purse, like she had written a note as to where she had left the car. Finally, someone lit a fire under her ass.... and she scurried to... . the car right in front of her. I begin to pull into her spot... but then I have to stop..... because another person emerged.... apparantly she had gone "Chevron Grocery Shopping" for the rest of the freaking month..... I almost got out of my 14 year old SUV and asked if she needed help with her bags. Mr. Coke Delivery Man filed out of the back of his truck.... with his dolly loaded with stuff..... I must have seen him scurry back and forth 6 times while I was filling up.... and I wasn't exactly on empty either !!!! Oh, and then someone starts yelling,...... waving, and yelling and woo-hoo-ing...... I look over.... and this person makes eye contact with me.... I stare for a couple of seconds.... when the fellows "Date for the Day" says something to him.... and he stops. So I am almost finished filling up my 14 year old vehicle.... when I see him. I saw what a fat comic strip person looks like... in real life. I couldn't believe it... I screwed the gas cap back into its spot, then picked up my jaw, and closed my mouth... Cheese and crackers Deanna.... have a little decorum. Uh-uh.  I couldn't help it... I had entered into this twilight zone and this was the final encounter.&nbsp; I draw people that look like this... he even had the walk... little arms and legs swinging away, back and forth, back and forth. On a sincere note.... I would&nbsp;hope I am not truly that evil... and I wished the man that he would find a method for weight loss... and he might have to start making those Pepsi's a Diet Pepsi instead. (I can't help it, perhaps I have a faulty perception meter........ I just write what I see).   I make my way over to the wonderful Town Centre Stadium... with it's amazing rubberized track. I love it. I then begin to walk... in circles and circles for an extended period of time. (It is not a long long time... I have too many things to do... I have no kids with me today, nor do I have to pick them up anytime soon !!!!) Once again,&nbsp; I enter into "A Zone of Extreme Intrigue and Story Gathering Tales". First thing first... it felt like the movie "GroundHog Day"... the same people were there ! I tried to keep the laughter inside my head..... it's not safe to walk around in circles laughing out loud..... people will really stare at you. The same group of boys wandered in, and took their post at&nbsp;the hurdles,&nbsp;the spitting man was still their spitting, the little chinese lady with the purple winter gloves sat&nbsp;crouched NEXT to the bleachers in the shade clapping her hands, ( she did have a choice of many trees&nbsp; that would have provided shade to clap her hands mind you), then there was the "Sheman-manshe?" (This person I am not certain what gender he/she was)... he was still wearing the same clothes as the other day).&nbsp; Then there were the laughing asian ladies up on the stairs... I think they were still laughing from the other day. I'm not even certain what they were doing. One would be up... then down... then they would all be done.. and then the leader would pick-up one ladies leg, and put it down... then they would all clap... and I don't know the rest because I was still walking in circles. Once again I had to withhold laughter..... I considered cruising up the steps and asking them if I could join. My thoughts were that they would start screaming " AAAhhhh white girl... white girl... you get out silly white girl"... I thought best not do that.&nbsp;Then there were the Tai-chi people. They had there music playing, and they were swaying... then they would stop, and talk, then continue.I was happily listening to their peaceful music...when...... the "Quick-Walker" shot past me... got me&nbsp;on the outside rim. Then the bastard lapped me.&nbsp; I didn't even hear him coming. He was wearing the same clothes as he was the other day to.&nbsp; Then Mr Grampa-with-the-baby-stroller came up on the inside.. and passed me. Shit!!!! What am I doing here??? I wondered... the one day that I show up... and do not concentrate on walking "on the line"... is when my life goes crazy !!!! You see, today... I walked between the lines.. meaning that I had a whole lane to myself... normally I concentrate on staying on one line... not sure why.. I just do it.... probably some OCD thing...anyways.... since I was having so much space to walk in today... I had the opportunity to explore strategies and ideas that I never really give issue to. I was enjoying the scenery and the breeze,&nbsp;of course all the people... and asking the big guy upstairs if this was my lifes destiny.... to be walking in circles,&nbsp;only to jump out of that realm when my help was needed.&nbsp;I gave some thought to those&nbsp;questions as I continue to circle.... and finally when I took a good look around.... &nbsp;all of my "groundhog day people" had left....there was me, and a fast runner left on the track... I didn't even notice the people back the gloves, and mats and music and leave.

       Trust me... for those that are "age-worthy", the&nbsp;comments/memories listed below will&nbsp;be good for you. Really.&nbsp; Take some time to read it.. it is a bit lengthy, but it will spur up some memories of long ago... let that brain have a work out...... challenge it into remembering happenings from your past. I do remember some of these,&nbsp; and some of them (I am glad to say) I am too young to know about... all the same... as a parent, it's interesting to have a look into the past and see how other times were.... enjoy....oh... and thanks to whoever thought this up!    DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN...? &nbsp; All the girls had ugly gym uniforms? It took five minutes for the TV warm up? Nearly everyone's Mom was at home when the kids got home from school? Nobody owned a purebred dog? When a quarter was a decent allowance? You'd reach into a muddy gutter for a penny? Your Mom wore nylons that came in two pieces? All your male teachers wore neckties and female teachers had their hair done every day and wore high heels? You got your windshield cleaned, oil checked, and gaspumped, without asking, all for free, every time? And you didn't pay for air?&nbsp; And, you got trading stamps to boot? Laundry detergent had free glasses, dishes or towels hidden inside the box? It was considered a great privilege to be taken out todinner at a real restaurant with your parents? They threatened to keep kids back a grade if they failed..&nbsp;&nbsp;and they did? When a 57 Chevy was everyone's dream car...to cruise, peel out, lay rubber or watch submarine races, and peoplewent steady? No one ever asked where the car keys were because they were always in the car, in the ignition, and the doors were never locked? Lying on your back in the grass with your friends and saying things like, That cloud looks like... And playing baseball with no adults to help kids with the rules of the game?&nbsp; Stuff from the store came without safety caps and hermetic seals because no one had yet tried to poison a perfect stranger? And with all our progress, don't you just wish, just once, you could slip back in time and savor the slower pace, and share it with the children of today? When being sent to the principal's office was nothing compared to the fate that awaited the student at home? Basically we were in fear for our lives, but it wasn't because of drive-by shootings, drugs, gangs, etc. Our parents and grandparents were a much bigger threat!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we survived because their love was greater than the threat. Send this on to someone who can still remember Nancy Drew, the Hardy Boys, Laurel and Hardy, Howdy Dowdy and the Peanut Gallery, the Lone Ranger, The Shadow Knows,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nellie Bell, Roy and Dale, Trigger and Buttermilk. As well as summers filled with bike rides, baseball games, Hula Hoops, bowling and visits to the pool,&nbsp;and eating Kool-Aid powder with sugar. Didn't that feel good, just to go back and say, "Yeah, I remember that"?&nbsp;I am sharing this with you today because it ended with a double dog dare to pass it on. To remember what a double dog dare is, read on. &nbsp;And remember that the perfect age is somewhere between&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; old enough to know better and too young to care. &nbsp;How many of these do you remember? Candy cigarettes, Wax Coke-shaped bottles with colored sugar water inside, Soda pop machines that dispensed glass bottles, Coffee shops with tableside jukeboxes, Blackjack, Clove and Teaberry chewing gum, Home milk delivery in glass bottles with cardboardstoppers, Newsreels before the movie,&nbsp; P.F. Fliers, Telephone numbers with a word prefix....(Raymond 4-601). &nbsp;Party lines, Peashooters, Howdy Dowdy, 45 RPM records, Green Stamps,&nbsp; Hi-Fi's, Metal ice cubes trays with levers, Mimeograph paper,&nbsp;Beanie and Cecil, Roller-skate keys, Cork pop guns, Drive ins, Studebakers, Washtub wringers, The Fuller Brush Man, Reel-To-Reel tape recorders, Tinkertoys, Erector Sets, The Fort Apache Play Set, Lincoln Logs, 15 cent McDonald hamburgers, 5 cent packs of baseball cards, with that awful pink slab of bubble gum,&nbsp; Penny candy, 35 cent a gallon gasoline, Jiffy Pop popcorn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Do you remember a time when...&nbsp;    &nbsp; Decisions were made by going "eeny-meeny-miney-moe"? Mistakes were corrected by simply exclaiming, "Do Over!"? "Race issue" meant arguing about who ran the fastest? Catching the fireflies could happily occupy an entireevening? It wasn't odd to have two or three "Best Friends"? The worst thing you could catch from the opposite sex was "cooties"? Having a weapon in school meant being caught with a slingshot? A foot of snow was a dream come true? Saturday morning cartoons weren't 30-minute commercials for action figures? "Oly-oly-oxen-free" made perfect sense? Spinning around, getting dizzy, and falling down was cause for giggles?&nbsp; The worst embarrassment was being picked last for a team? War was a card game? Baseball cards in the spokes transformed any bike into a motorcycle? Taking drugs meant orange-flavored chewable aspirin? Water balloons were the ultimate weapon? If you can remember most or all of these, then you have lived!!!!!!!&nbsp; Pass this on to anyone who may need a break from their "grown-up" life . . .I double-dog-dare-ya!

       I don't have much time... on the way to summer camp... but I can't help myself...    Yesterday driving home:&nbsp;Mr. Nine year old thinking boy says to me... "Do you think God is happy"... "oh brother... here it goes.. I think".... "Well", he continues. "Do you think he is at least 50% happy with the world he created?"....&nbsp; oh oh, these out there conversations, always a stumbling block for me.... "Why do you ask?" I ask.... he continues... "You know, with all of the weapons, and warfare, and people dying, and bad things happening in the world, people hurting people, &nbsp;and all of the drugs that are everywhere, people have done this to themselves... and I was just thinking if they could find a place to put all this bad stuff.... then they could rid of it... and the world would be a nice place... and then I think God would be maybe 75% happy with his world again.... what do you think?" Gulp, swallow.... brainstorm... oh were home, whew.

      I had been sleeping since around midnight. All I can hear is crunching, and crunching and more crunching. It's 4:00 AM. I get up walk down the hall shut the pocket door, and the french door, and walk back down the hall again. There waiting for me is the cruncher, sitting up in her basket, anxiously waiting my return.... move it out missy.. as she begins her long scary walk down the hall. She's bumping into me the whole time... then cautiously surprises herself and makes a bee-line for the laundry room... regrets that move, crashes into my leg, and follows my lead. I open the sliding glass door... be free basket cruncher.....as she scampers away. Next.... from the depths of the living room it starts. Hissy wakes up. Hiss, whine, cry. Hiss, whine, cry. The french door heaves. Hiss, whine, cry. Another attempt at banging the french door. "Wait your turn", I say.... I am now sitting at the computer, which I awoke from its slumber... and it's now busy blinding me. I can hear the basket cruncher still moving around outside... she's confused.... not certain what her next move should be... after all its dark.. everywhere except for that orb in the corner... I call to her, and she re-enters the kitchen and sits down next to me.. and starts to lick... lick, lick, lick .. my hand. The hissing, whining and crying has become almost more annoying than the basket crunching. Except now I am awake....not dreaming the crunching sound. Licky wont move... she has decided that under no circumstances she will be making her way back to her basket crunching... she gives me her paw... licks that then licks my hand. This step gets repeated over and over...until I give her her paw back.. then do the quick stand routine.... all right missy.. back to bed.. realizing her danger level is at a low level, she slowly makes her way back to the basket.. settles in and sighs. Now for the hissing beast behind the french doors... she is what nightmares are made of. She rushes out, comes and slams her body up against the chair that I am sitting in.... throws up her paw, falls to the floor... then eyes that the sliding door is still open... in a heartbeat I hear her tinkling around the backyard..... she has not returned... all is quiet. There is the occasional tinkle, and she is just waiting, and waiting to see if the basket cruncher will return, so she can attack from the depths of darkness..... Eventually, she gets bored of&nbsp; her early morning hunt and makes her way back inside... and takes her post on the leather couch in the den. All is quiet and still once again. Well, except for the psychotic owner who is clicking away at her keys at four freaking thirty in the morning. Freak.

       Today was the first day of summer camp.... I then have nothing to write about. Pip was busy pulling other peoples chains, and Mr. Sensible was busy talking peoples ears off. I like summer camp.... it's just so good for me. It's almost like school, but we can be late... the bus doesn't pick them up until 9:20. THEN... the better part.... I don't need to collect them until 4:15... that's a whole extra hour of doing things. I like that. I did many things today......    most importantly... got a Tim Hortons  went to the bank.....  found my way to Home Depot....stared at the orchids for a while, made it outside to their garden centre... was disgusted at the crap they had left.... well it was colourful crap, not the stuff you think of, when you read the word  dropped off film at Costco  found a track and walked and walked and walked in circles for a large period of time  then my sister and her two kids&nbsp;spotted me, slowed me down...then I had to leave  went to the&nbsp; Art 'n' Knapps (garden centre) for new flowers... I wasn't happy with the progress of my huge barrel arrangement... I think the heliotropes had actually shrunk since I put them in the growing spot... or maybe I didn't tell them they were in this spot to grow. Bought some cool pots, and more plants for cheapo dollars !!!!  met my sister at Costco with her two boys, to give her the eldests birthday pictures... I hope she didn't wait long for me... as it turned out.. I was only able to give her two pictures..... I still had that roll at home ......ooooppppssss !!!!  I didn't colour my hair.. I should have but I didn't ... oh well... people will just have to get used to the woman with the "rainbow effect" hair colour... not in the exact colours of the rainbow mind you... just shades of brown... starting with lighter at the top, to quite fashionable dark at the ends.... now that is truly attractive... can't wait to go out again tomorrow..... that is priority one for tomorrow morning.... before the drop off with the chicklets  Made it home... made a conscious effort not to vacuum...I think the hair balls grow while you are out. I am sure when I left the house there weren't that many floating around. ( I have to vacuum every day because of the two evil beasts).  Dug out planter boxes, repotted junk from the front barrel, fixed the front barrel, cleaned out the unknown zone... (dead space that I use for a planter box garden... not sure why the morons that built our wooden deck before we owned the house...didn't make the side of the space a deck... cheap bastards !!!).  Was able to make it through the garage and find a ladder, hammer and nails to put back on a piece of the crapola deck roofing that has been off since last year... the King Repair Man thought he was going to redo the whole deck...... idiot !!!!  Painted the back screen door kick panel.... this, (like the rest of my day) wasn't planned. I was looking at buckets... that I thought were paint... found a colour that I thought was blue.. found a tarp.. and starting painting... hmmmm this is a bluey-smokey grey colour... oh well the King might not notice....  played the piano... Elton might have a smile on his face if I continue at this pace... "the candle in the wind" is getting a "titch" better sounding.  posted some pictures....fiddled with my photo editor... checked out how things looks when I decreased the saturation to create a black and white photo. Cool.  Walked around hammering the heads of nails back into the deck... they seem to creep up after a while... will save some screaming from miss you know who.   Funs over... left to collect the weary day campers. Brought juice and cookies to charge&nbsp;the missys batteries... because I know she would require some form of refreshment.... and besides it would give her mouth something to do rather than bark out orders at me. They both started fighting... Mr. Sensible was caught being Mr. Idiot... and he didn't like that... so Pip started to tell me his woes.. he didn't like that... they starting fighting.. I started yelling.... Oh, I see everyones back!  Stopped at the sisters to collect Super Sonic Reading Boys Books  Took them for a drive... not that they didn't just have a drive... but it was that awful 4:30 hour.. that awful time when it's still ok to find people to play with... anyways.. made it down to Minnekhada Lodge... we sat and watched a bear in the field. Then we drove to the other side of the park.. and in someones sideyard we saw two huge bears cruising around. WOW, three bears in one day....&nbsp;  Made some hideous chicken surprise for the chicklets... Mr Hate Everything Unless its a Hamburger ate it all up... hmmm... The Pipster on the other hand had some story as to how come she didn't like it.. but then she liked some parts and not others... and oh please, Pip give me your plate.......  Mr Cool King Dad gave Pip her stuff so she could ride her bike. I was on the phone.&nbsp;(she had been standing in front of me... tapping her feet, and throwing evil stares at me... waiting so she could go out and ride her to-small-for-her-purple-bike, with training wheels still on, but raised to the level of the rear fender to act as a kick stand). Then the screaming Mimi just kept riding up and down our street at full speed. She's not going to have a face left... I just know it. I pumped up her back tire... she loved the extra speed she got from that.... she was as big as a thumb nail... and what's that I see... oh she has fallen... oh thank you she got up. It was a slow ride home. She walked up onto the lawn dropped her bike and her helmut, and demanded her blanket, that&nbsp;she needed to lie down, and where was her cold cloth. She was done. As only Pip would want, King Video Dad put on Santa Claus is Coming to Town... guess who picked it???  Found my book I am reading.. got distracted by the screen saver.. and here I am.  Yae, it's only Tuesday.... they will have fun again at camp tomorrow... so will I !

      King Camper Husband Man made it back from his boyfriend weekend. He said he tried to call. And call. And call.&nbsp;And call again...&nbsp;Aha... my ESP was working nicely... I knew he made it up there alright...So, he's just sitting in the kitchen reading the newspaper, minding his own business... doing his own thing, making some hamburgers on the BBQ (very low maintenance). Oh, and the Pip is back... yes, The Missy Madmouth is Back. The Boy and I went to go pick her up this afternoon... "oh, her" he says... "couldn't we just forget about her...because I kind of already did, and leave her where she is...the neighbourhood has been nice and quiet without her". "Come on boy, face the music.. life isn't the same without our Pip", I say. "Yes, it's peaceful, quiet,&nbsp; and no&nbsp;silly hissing&nbsp;girls running around MY house", he says. Well, you do have a point... let's go Mr. Comedy.....   ( oh a side bar from last night...... )....I was here, at my post... and Mr Funnyman comes walking in the kitchen from&nbsp;his friends next door, they had been bouncing on his trampoline... it's about 10:40, "where is everybody?", he asks... "It's just me Mr. Funnyman, all on my lonesome, me, the keyboard and my thoughts" I say. He sits in the kitchen chair and sighs.... then says: (He comes up with some ...hmmm I'll guess southern drawl...) "What about me mama, I'm here with ya... you must'nt forget about me...". I crack up.&nbsp; Nice boy, real nice.........................  anyways... back to business................so, the girls home. IMMEDIATELY IT STARTS. "Well you know.. I am board, and I think I am thirsty" she begins.... I look at the clock. Hmmm, she's been home long enough to hug her Super Camper Dad... and look at her room. 2 minutes. Yae. "You go fuss", I say to her... "you go find a friend". Ha, she forgot the drink... I think to myself as she marches across the street to ambush her friend that was locked away in her home. Life is good... until the friend had to go in. Now she's back.. and she's pissed... and guess who she is taking it out on... me. Me, in my garden. I was just happily watering and feeding my flowers. Then SHE arrived. Now she's thirsty and hungry..... and mad. SHIT!!!!! She wants a TOFU milkshake. "Can't you just eat the hamburger that Grama made for you, and I brought home because I knew you would do this????" I asked her. I don't like hamburgers she said. " Freaking Liar" was the first thought running through my head... but me, being the ADULT, I&nbsp;am not allowed to say that to Miss High Maintenance. "I want a TOFU milkshake, as she holds the package in her hand....(this is not safe... ). "Can you ask Daddy to peel back the lid, and you can eat like a pudding.... "No! It's a milkshake or nothing! she yells&nbsp;(you bet it's nothing missy I think). "Pardon me"....(I eye her).. then, in&nbsp;a calmer tone she repeats it. That's when King Camper Super Evil Dad pipes up... Pip, that's enough, bring it here...... but it was too late... she had already tossed the TOFU out across the patio... see that... see that.... I opened it just fine, she states... I didn't want the stuff anyways. "Miss Fusspot... go to your room please" I call from the backyard. "Fine! I was heading there anyways...." as I hear her footsteps march into the distance. Ahh.... she's back, she's back, she's back... I say to myself as I finish watering my odd assortment of flowers. Cicely on the otherhand is having a nice refreshing TOFU break fresh off the deck. Eventually I make my way over with the hose... it was an easy clean up. Great. She's back.. and full of remorse... crap. Miss Blondy is busy bawling. I remind her of her badness. She claims she wasn't. Pardon me, throwing TOFU across the patio is not bad... well it isn't good missy. So then she apologizes, and then states clearly she is thirsty, and that's it. Fine... go get a drink... have some Soya Milk... and so off she went... tear stained.... but a bit remorseful. ( I think). Well, by the time I have made it out front with my watering can and plant food. There's Pip; on the front step eating another&nbsp; (and proudly opened by her) TOFU container... this time in her favourite Barbie bowl. "See what I did", she happily admits. Great... did you get whatever you needed to drink I ask her. "Oh yes, see". (she has the BIGGEST glass possible... full to the brim with Soya Milk). So the young&nbsp;lady (she's 13, and our babysitter)&nbsp;from next door comes over. Pip finds a book then reads to Tina.... and finally, when all is said and done.. I ask Miss Pip "did you finish your TOFU"... "oh no" she says... while I wasn't looking... some ants crawled in it.

      Hey !  Isn't it fun to read about&nbsp;yourself..... and you know it's you, and you don't even read your name&nbsp;&nbsp;    S&nbsp; P&nbsp; O&nbsp; O K&nbsp; Y    !!!&nbsp; .... the blogging people should send out notice when it's making changes....(like a flashing &nbsp;little red blotch with a yellow NEW in the middle of it)..&nbsp;I'm pretty new to this... I don't know if you have to have spend a certain amount of time typing with a bad templete to earn rights to get a&nbsp;new and improved model... are these the Magic Rules that people just end&nbsp;up knowing, without anyone saying anything. Speaking of rules.... WE have these two dogs. They're German Shepherds, females, one, we picked and the other picked us. They really hate one another. Really. They like people. (Lucky for them). But... there are so many freaking rules about owning them.... and then of course there are the non-rules, or, shall I put it.. the back up plan rules about owning them.... the first one, "Cicely" named after the fictional town in Alaska from that show "Nothern Exposure", (which I think should have never left the air due to it's innate ability to add quirkiness to your lives at just the right moment !). Then there's&nbsp;L.P. (or Ellpee,&nbsp; since people ask me how to spell her name, and at the risk of sounding like a total creep from the down under... I just spell her name out.... of course the whole time thinking to myself.... OK it's back to kindergarten for you..... ) Anyways, these two beasts have drafted up the most detailed list of do's and don'ts you'd think they were poodles. Ha ha, if they could read, I would be dead.&nbsp; They not only hate each other, they hate poodles, well they hate all of the rest of the four legged world. (We've been trying to keep them away from bears, gorillas, apes&nbsp;and kangaroos... they could have some difficulty with these). You know that saying something like "if one door closes, another one opens"..... I should have made it up, but not for the hopeful opportunistic reasons it was intended for.. but rather to separate our beloved beasts from ripping one anothers throats out. (So far this method has worked) They are very similar to ships that pass in the night.... we open the sliding door, one goes out, as the other comes in... sometimes they bump heads,&nbsp;my heart skips a beat and I wince, I reach forward to give them a little nudge... and all is safe...until next time. LP... the dingbattish one of the two, sometimes forgets that she is not allowed in the yard when Cicely is out there. I was busy outside one day, and out she saunters... with Cicely sitting next to me. unnkg. gulp. I drop what I am doing, walk to the sliding door open it wide, make eye contact with the dingbat and ask her to come. A wrong move on my part would incite Cicely... and she would run over to LP to show her dominence.... and then the fur would be flying.&nbsp; They are very good at both lunging onto one another... and doing some kind of death roll (similar to a crocodile with fur).... this has proven to be a&nbsp;difficult separation attempt. So, that is why we have Babygates. They work, for big dog fights... I have many times just pushed the babygates between their two faces, and separated them... and then when they lunge back for more... there's already that magical door effect... and they go back to their different parts of their world. AAhhh, it's nicely clouding over, and I want to go and work in the yard... so will continue some new rant later today

       I just want to tell my blogging buddy..... and you know who you are..... you blew out my already blown out of porportion&nbsp;Deanna-World to blogger bits !!! Kaboom, bamboozled, blammed, and now, just bummed out.&nbsp; he he he... had ya !!!! I am feeling a little worse for words after a day at work.&nbsp; Say&nbsp;all of that three times quickly, except don't mistakingly put in the word "hard". I didn't have a hard day at work.... I was just their.... doing whatever it is I do.&nbsp; Tonight is a night for another list....once again, I have so many things to say... but no real off-beat stories to flip onto the screen.   The Pipster called me at work today.... and her little voice (she is only little while&nbsp;on the phone... otherwise she's kind of an amazon girl.... tall, blond, blue- eyed, oh, and at this time of year even with sunscreen...tanned.... what a dog !) anyways, she announces that she really likes her Grama Cuckoo (sound worse in print, but it's all really OK !), so she'd like to stay their tonight. All right Pip... be good I said to her... she dropped the phone and went screaming around the kitchen.... hmm I say to my Mom... you can have her.  Mr King Husband Thing "Boyfriend Weekend"&nbsp;Man never called to say they made it to their destination..... so if anyone here's from him... could you let me know !!!  That boy of mine&nbsp;is turning into a mouse, he has&nbsp;red eyes because.... he&nbsp;had a marathon &nbsp;X-Box/Playstation 2 kind of day, with a Birthday Party&nbsp; ( with swimming ) thrown into the middle of the day for diversion.... needless to say he's happy, and I think I see a tail beginning to sprout! ( I have a little dark secret for him tomorrow.... it's right back to the one a hour a day starting tomorrow.... )  I need a maid. I stopped by my favourite Sushi place.... because that little Sushi man that I dreamed of that would be in my kitchen.... I think he was here... but I think he made Sushi for other people, and he left a big mess here. I don't think that I want to start dreaming of a maid... I think that would be kind of sick.... I will add that to my "eagerly await" list, to fend off any strange dreams !!! ha he he  I saw one of my friends at work today... and she howled in laughter at me when I told her that I had grounded my sweet blue-eyed son for two weeks. Then her eyes bugged out when I told her that I stuck to my&nbsp;evil wicked ways... and kept him grounded for the whole two weeks. She was frightened to know what it is that he did... and when I told her .... "he didn't listen to me..", she laughed even harder. Now I am left wondering....&nbsp;am I&nbsp;"Queen Evil" ( I wonder if that's howcome I call our oldest shepherd "Evil Queen"... dogs do take after their master... well if that was the case... then I guess calling Mr. Husband Man's&nbsp;"Boyfriend Weekend" isn't wrong..... is it... ???)&nbsp;.... the pieces of the puzzle are all starting to fall into place..... he he he. !!! only kidding. Anyways, back to the facts.... See, in the end, I kind of thought that the whole grounding thing was really a holiday... for me. (oh, Mr. Blue-eyes was grounded from TV, PS2, and computer). It was very peaceful. For Me.&nbsp; I didn't really see anything wrong with it... but from parents extreme reactions... perhaps I was a&nbsp;eencie bit harsh.... ah, who cares..... I have a sweet boy with blue eyes... that listens, only because he can now hear his name when I call him about 20 times in a row, instead of listening to his computer "rollercoaster tycoon" blabbing away at him.  The Pip thought she was grounded the other day..I told her she would catch some troubles (like lose the use of the computer... and she loves her Princess crap that she plays) if she misbehaved. (She's a natural when&nbsp;it comes to misbehaving!)&nbsp;I had to go to a periodontist.... so I brought the chicklets with me. They're 7 and 91/2... they are quite capable of sitting, reading a book, and remaining silent for 20 -25 minutes.. without acting like fools. So, I'm in this dentist chair.... and I'm only their for a consult... they want to do "A" gum graft. Now, to me, that means ONE. That's it. Well, apparantley.... "A" doesn't mean ONE anymore!! (Have these people never heard of A-1 before ??) So, I want to know how ONE turns into FOUR.&nbsp;Now the fun part begins...... I can't quite figure out howcome it's going to COST $600.00 to move 4 pieces of gum. That's $600.00 each.&nbsp; Now times it by 4. That's right.... you can do the math.&nbsp; I'm kinda thinkin here something is "amuck"... because you know when you travel;(across provinces that is).. you can pay a return fare.... well of these pieces of "gum"&nbsp;are only going one way.. shouldn't there be a reduction in cost? And besides..... I am supplying my own gum, so that should result in further reductions.... am I right. Wrong. hmmmm ....I am now standing at the&nbsp;reception desk, leaning on the counter, staring at this paper... the whole while, Mr. Responsibility is standing next to me... shaking his head, tapping my shoulder, and pointing at "The Pipster". She is standing in the centre of the reception area... caught in the act of being "My Little Pipster".... she starts to cry. So I say hold it, you can't cry, I'm going to cry.... I leave my paper and go sit down with her. Mr Responsibility informs me of her antics while I was busy having my bank account drained, all the while trying to keep my teeth in my head..... so I say to "Pip", is it true, did you stand in front of the mirror and dance and sing quietly... did you really do all that??? The dam overflows, she turns to jelly&nbsp;and the little Pipster is nodding yes... well, I said, "Did you do a good dance?" She nods again. "Well, good for you Pip, I'm glad that you danced... because good quiet little girls that are politely dancing, and not bothering their brothers are wonderful!!! Mr Responsibility was looking at me, The Pip was looking at me.. and the desk ladies were looking at me. I stood up to collect the "A4" graft statement... and the reception ladies were most impressed with the silent kids that they had. They couldn't believe that the kids sat quietly, they at one point looked up to see if they were still their.... they didn't even see they had a dancing queen underfoot..... My Pip..!. To thank them&nbsp;I took them out for lunch after that... because as I know... the very second you get that girl into the vehicle she's hungry... we listened to her howls of hunger pains the whole way.... even into the restaurant my actress turned dancer was leaning on me..... I got her a drink of milk (to shut the beast up!!!)..... and when her food came.... she sat and coloured her Arthur colouring book... and we boxed her food for home.!!!  I'll call it a day... I will have to venture out tomorrow to find some human interest stories to fill my head with... and then offer up the points of interest for tomorrows post.

       Hey again, what's with all the new fonts.... is it a mileage pay off...&nbsp;if you write over 12,000 words in under 65 days... you get better features.....ooooohhhh, I am in love. OH, I think I am fondling the template... I can add colour, and images... and I don't have to write from left to write... and they have numbered paragraphs...... and the font can be changed....... there really is a God ! I believe...&nbsp; I really believe !!!!! Enough of that crap. However this got here.... oh happy day.&nbsp; Well, here it goes:   You have to check out this blog.... beFrank..... I think its  urlLink www.coolshots.blogspot.com . He will instantly become a must read. Anyways, he was planning on doing some reformating... and I (and a bunch of other people) basically begged him not to... if you check out his site you will know why.. how would I write it.... it's just cool. So, on that note.... every body has a say.. and votes do count, so pat yourself on the back if you do it... and remind yourself (if you don't)&nbsp;for next time.  Look at that... my second thought... coming right at you..... I am worried for the people of North America. It appears to me... (as I was driving home from work today after  3    weeks  off from work), that people are spending way tooo tooooo much money on clothes and hairstyles.... but lacking in funds for mirrors. I was frightened by some of the concoctions that people had put together... actually what I really said was... "Holy Shit.... what blind person dressed you this morning". ( Am I safe in writing that... I don't want to offend the "well dressed under-sighted")   The song of the day (on the piano) is "Midnight Special" found in my Reader's Digest Treasury of Best Loved Songs, ((Note; some of these are not best loved..... I was playing the theme from Love Story the&nbsp;other day"Where Do I&nbsp;Begin"... and&nbsp;Miss Pipster&nbsp;(blond 7 year old) says to me... yuk... is that dying music?))......&nbsp;somehow a person named "Huddie Ledbetter" AKA "Leadbelly" reshaped this from overhearing folks songs from a Texas prison. I figured that I better give this one a try, since Elton John would still not be impressed with my "Candle in the Wind"..... he's probably burn the sheet music I was playing from.   King Camper Mr. Husband Man has gone away with all of his   BOYFRIENDS   this weekend. It's a free weekend to boot. All year long they strip metal, and recycle it for cash.... which they&nbsp;dump into an account... and then for one weekend in the summer they go away.... all expenses paid.&nbsp; I think if they were really&nbsp;kind hearted gentlemen they would fork over the freaking cash and just let the wives go shopping. Maybe then I would quit calling everyone "  BOYFRIENDS  ". Until that happens.... the name remains, as well as the pink lettering !    I HATE THE WALK IN CLINIC. Both of the chicklets are coming down with colds... they never really have colds that amount to nothing... or that a couple of mega doses of Vitamin C could cure... they always have to get stupid things... things that make me go to the walk-in clinic... because their actual Dr. is always too busy... and, is actually a pain in the ass to drive to. SO.... best alternative is the walk-in clinic. For whatever reason... these guys just bug me. I always feel like a mother that has "Muncheussers", or however we are spelling the word on a Friday night....but on that thought... they 9 1/2 times out of 10 walk out of the clinic with a prescription that will inevedibly cure their ailments.&nbsp; Since I am working all day tomorrow, I am sure Sunday morning we will make our way their. In the meantime... I will send Mr. Funnyboy to the neighbours (first thing in the morning, to play x-box with my friends&nbsp; 4 year old son... so she can sleep in, ---because her husband is away and&nbsp;busy studying to be a "Vancouver Police Man"), and get this...&nbsp; then off to another boys birthday party... that he generally&nbsp;my Mr Funnyboy&nbsp;doesn't even care for. The Girl will go to my parents place for the day... where they have their "New 8-year-old" dog..... and she can drive them crazy with all of her blond Pipster comments....     My apologies... I had way more to say earlier... but I seemed to have forgotten them. Which is quite sad... considering how important dribble is actually worth these days.    Over and out for now......

      For all those home schooler people out there... you must be either deaf, or simply crazy. I have a couple of books for the chicklets to work on over the summer. Just enough to keep their little brains stimulated.... and more than enough to make the mother 1 inch closer to insanity. Today, I will call him "King Comedy"...( he is working on some math)then he starts to carry on.... first, using all of his home-made accents to ask me questions with, then when I start to laugh... then King Comedy turns into a crooner. With every word I natter away at the Pipster, (who is madly cutting out her words to paste onto her page), he sings his every thought. "KING COMEDY!"  I begin to escalate.... he immediately sings back... "Ooh.. my mom is getting angry... I better be quiet..." Alright King Comedy you are done..... I say to him.... "Go and brush your teeth for at least 10 minutes... since you managed to miss doing them yesterday" I say. All is quiet. The Pipster finally gets mad at her paperwork, and throws it in a heap, and leaves it on the table. Well that's a wrap for "Homeschooling on Handley".... and then I sit here and begin to write.... BUT, King Comedy isn't done... he wanders back into the kitchen after about 10 minutes... and he says to me... "I broke it down... I have spent the last 12 minutes brushing my teeth, which I broke into sections in my mouth... he then begins pointing at his cheeks....2 minutes here, and 2 minutes here.... and on and on it goes..." which brings me to tears in laughter. This would be why I believe in the Public Education System, it all comes down to safety... it wouldn't be safe to try and teach these two personalities at home.....they could make me lose my mind. Well, must go and get real things accomplished today...

      The silence of the morning tricks me into thinking that I have the whole day ahead of me... the list of jobs can wait one more hour... the cup of coffee will remain steaming next to me. The little people begin to rise, and the fluffy four legged beasts take their posts... one inside and one outside.. and continue their 13 hour naps. The whole while that I am cruising the Blogging World I have this rant that continues through my head... "I've got to do this, I've got to do this, I've got to do this, I've "......meaning that, I have a list of things to do... and it continues to grow, the longer I sit here in the morning. The truth be told... I have way to much curiosity inside of me.... and as I always say.... " If I was a Cat, I would be dead ... a long time ago...". Further to that thought.. I always have something to say. If I read something of someone's.... I comment... and who knows why, and for what reason I am compelled.....I just have to..... It's that Cat Theory I think. So people out there... You are forewarned.... you may have more readers than you know, but it's really the commenters that count !

      So my son, I will refer to him as Mr. Safety. Quite simply because that is exactly who he is. Mr. Safety was concerned that the power went out, more importantly would that television continue to work after the power came back, and will his computer "Star Wars" game be saved. He was "banking" on playing two hours worth of SW. He had apparantly saved his one hour from yesterday, which I payed no attention to, so now today, that gives him two hours. Oh yae. The girl (the Pipster)on the otherhand was concerned as to whether the water park would work. (She was armed with a limited amount of information about water and electricity....)So off we go.... we walk over to the waterpark... just to find that it doesn't work. Hmmm. "I told you about this power outage" she hisses at me as her eyes begin to narrow and her blond hair growing bigger by the second. I think I also saw the cat claws begin to emerge... Well, let's just go for a little walk around the neighbourhood and see what everyone is up to. "No" she hisses again... "I just hate this neighbourhood now that the power is out". So Mr. Safety and I begin to walk, as she follows in a skulking/stalking fashion that only a very sly angry cat would move. We kind of walk fast, not letting her too close to our heels. As we meander through the neighbourhood she finds some friends from her school. "Well, I better cover" she proclaims, "I know these boys don't like to see girls wandering around with their bikinis on". (That-a-girl Pipster... if you could only have that same thought 6 years from now)...... with house alarms ringing throughout the neighbourhood, we rounded the corner to home.

      Candle in the Wind. It's a beautiful song. Except when I play it. I  REALLY  admire people that can sing and play. (That can sing and play well all at the same time.... like Elton that is). I can barely put my fingers on the correct keys to keep the song flowing let alone noise coming out of my mouth !!!! On that NOTE... I will go play it again Sam !!!

      My world hasn't even started for the day... And I already have something to write. I am proud of myself, I can look in the mirror and smile, well, for me just laugh hysterically !!! A preface for that statement should be a confession that I have been cruising this morning..... and once again I have come to the conclusion that people are just plain nuts !! I haven't started a side-bar of the places I visit.... (I guess that would be pointing fingers now wouldn't it)...but I have them tucked away on my "favourites" spot.. for quick access, or quite simply, to give myself a boost that I am not as crazy as I think I am. Now this is a good thing. Now where's that third cup of coffee?

      Alright, I have had the most interesting useless day on record. (Not including the 5 days I spent at Loon Lake). This morning I was clearly confused about time... this afternoon it seems that I was clearly confused by reading. Somehow I managed to take the kids to TKD for a 6:00 class, if there had been a 6:00 class. WE show up, and the class is half over. How is it that I am a moron ??? So, then this woman ( I will call her a "newbie", since she is a white belt and all) shows up. She and her son regularly come at the same time as us... but now it's summer hours.. and things have changed. So, Miss Newbie wouldn't even be so kind to answer any questions. My friend asked her what class she was going to.. and she snottily said "6:30". So, there I am in.. in utter confusion... looking desperately at the schedule..... willing the numbers 6:30 to appear before my eyes.. but to no avail... and no where do I see any class starting at 6:30. Heck I was confused by the words - Family Class Monday-Friday 6:00 - 7:00. Doesn't that qualify Tes/Wed/Thurs to have a class at 6:00? And now Miss Newbie has thrown a wrench in my confusion... and wouldn't even answer a question. That's OK, because I have watched her do her punches... and I don't like the way she holds her hands.. she looks like a boxer... not someone doing Tae Kwon Do.. take that Miss Newbie wherever you are !!!!!

      So the big trip... How could I forget to write about that event. Let me get the details straight..... we had a great drive up their.... nice scenery on the way up, the truck did not break, Ellpee was fine in her kennel (2nd German Shepherd.. but a crazy/schizo version), the kids were both quiet..... 4 1/2 hr drive.. !!! (Graham with his 35 comic books.. might of had something to do with it.)Ditto for the drive home and another 4 1/2 hr drive. And that's a wrap. ....  Oh, on an after thought... I remember at one point on the Friday night... I said out loud to myself... only two more days of hell until we get to go home.

      In our little house we have about 15 clocks, 1 on the computer, 6 watches and 2 cellphones. Each of them tell time. Oh, and then as a reminder there is also one in the vehicle. If I do the math correctly today that adds up to 25 items that could potentially help me. So can somebody tell me why I would show up one hour early to a Birthday Party? The whole sad part about this catastrophe is the fact that I barely make it on time for anything, that's including fun things to. So, today I make it to the party with 10 minutes extra to spare..... "I rock", I thought to myself... "Is the start of the rest of my life being on time!!!".....But then panic sets in.... the doors to Silver City are still locked... and the birthday party people are nowhere to be found... let alone any other human. "So am I at the right spot"... I wonder to myself. So, I call my friend (I have taken her daughter with us to the party) to inquire if I am at the right spot. "Ah damn Deanna", she says to me. "Do you realize what you have done????? she continues.... " You had me convinced that it was later than it was, and now I have just fed all the kids lunch.....(she runs a daycare, and has 5 little people under the age of 3 about her).... and I can't figure out why they are not eating.... it's only 10 to 11.... you are supposed to be there at 10 to 12" she informed me. OH. Shit. So that would be the reason that I didn't get all the things done that I needed to do this morning, I didn't think that I was that much of a loser, that I couldn't get myself organized for the day. So, there I was in the boiling heat, with three excited children and one hour to kill at a Movie Theatre that wasn't even open yet. Yae for me. Does anyone have the time?

        He.. he... he....   I snickered away at myself. I have added a stat counter... now for what reason I am not certain... I believe it is a way as a self monitoring device.... or, how many times I access this word play in one day... I am just tickled.. only because I have been fussing with "junk" and have not been successful until today. I still have round edges on the corners, and the colours are still green and watery... it's all good. (But then I haven't left the house yet, and it is 9:19 in the morning, the Pipster is awake but has not spoken yet, so that could just be a premature thought.) I am worried though. Now that I have manipulated the template... I know I will want more. Flashing lights, sound effects, blinking boxes all striving for my affection, little pop-ups with  "PICK ME !!!"  jumping from my screen and touching my keyboard themselves.I wonder if they have a screen buddy out there somewhere....(I'm looking for something that fades in with a ghostly appearance) something with a scratchy voice that says "Step away from the keyboard, you have other things to do, there is nothing for you to report or comment on.... and the world hasn't said anything either!" Hmmm good thought.... but then again, everyone could own a Pipster, and now she has made me crazy, and will not leave my side, and keeps saying "I am hungry, I am hungry, I am hungry, I am hungry, ....." So there you go, I didn't have to look far.....

      Well, we are back. All alive, intact, including both the beasts familiarly referred to as dogs....this was the list that I gave to the lady that looked after our 10 1/2 year old german shepherd. She's kind of high maintenance, and we have never left her with anyone... she just doesn't fit "The Kennel Experience", so this amazing woman down the road kept her for us...   Cicely’s    Vacation     Requests   I am otherwise known as the Evil Queen…. He he he….. I am really a good dog…. I’ve just gone bad….he, he he…. I mostly like people, and I tolerate kids. See my Do’s and Don’ts list that my human friend has come up with…… most of them I will agree to, some of them I am proud of, and the others require no comment.    Please Do :  I like to be petted, a lot. And when you stop… I will paw at you, and probably tell you not to stop.  Give me two scoops around dinner time… I won’t necessarily eat it, but then that will give me something to do later when I pick up a mouthful and run into another room, spit it out, then eat it. This is a great game; it drives the human’s nuts! I like to talk, you can tell me to do things… and I will almost always give you an answer. I will tell you when I want to go outside, just ask me. I like my pills with cheese, or sometimes with a cracker… if you have something extra around… because I really like people food…. Although the kitchen staff doesn’t do a very good job of serving it… I especially love watermelon and apples. If I am just sitting staring into space, I like to be reminded that I have a bunch of toys that need to attended to. Right now I’m in love with the new soccer ball… it builds my jaw muscles… doesn’t do much for cleaning the teeth..  oh well If you like, I love big rocks. I carry them around; toss them on the ground…. And have quite a bit of fun hissing at the little beasts I noticed your strawberry plants yesterday…. You may need to stop me from eating them….. As far as I know, I am colour blind…. But I can’t resist the taste. Remind me to settle down. Sometimes I have just so many things that I am thinking about that I begin to pace… and I need to be reminded to relax, a Queen’s job is never done. I do fetch. Fetch and return, no thanks, that’s simply too much work. Ask me to speak, shake a paw, lie down, sit, and rollover.. (the latter only occasionally)   Please DON’T : I do not like to have my tail touched. An adult can touch it… but I will run away if you try!! I don’t like you to take my toys.  They’re mine. I do not share. I never have and never will; even those people that I live with can’t make me.  Besides, I will just pick my stuff up and walk away anyways… I will always win.   Blow in my nose…. Those people do it… just to get a rise out of me! Don’t worry if you do not give me a pill everyday…. Those people do not give one to me every day… only when it looks like I am favouring this little elbow of mine. Make me race up and down the stairs, I’m not too used to them… and it’ll make my arm sore. I’ll keep that to a minimum thanks…. Do Queens’ even need to exercise???? Don’t worry….I know, I know…. Leave the bees, butterflies and birds alone…. But while I am in control of your yard… I must be diligent in driving them away. Also, do not worry, I have never bitten a human and I do not growl…but I kind of make some kind of hissing noise when someone tries to take my toys. Usually I have already grabbed my beloved item and ran off anyways. Don’t worry about trying to get me to stop barking… if you call my name enough times, I might take the time to listen to you and stop. I don’t really bark for no reason. Worry if you forget to bring me inside, I have on occasion “been forgotten” by the common people inside….. I will wait for you…. As I waited for them….. WHEN THE SUN CAME UP. (Beasts!) Don’t feel that you need to take me out for a walk. I enjoy dragging my humans on occasion around the neighbourhood…but I do not enjoy idle chit chat with any other four legged “anythings”.

      Earlier today I wrote about lol abuse. Seriously, it's a serious issue, nothing to laugh at, inside or outside. Now, I will comment on Mouse Love... I love my mouse so much that I just left this poor woman who is busy having labour pains with her 6th child... a word of encouragement 3 times over... the same message three times over that is... only just because I couldn't remove my finger from my beloved left clicker. I just love the way that little mouse feels in that hand, and the rubbery texture of the wheel. Who could not want to touch this mouse at all times..... so ... my apologies for the mouse issue. Perhaps its a safety feature... it only scurries when my hand lets it... and the only time I see red, is when I lift my mouse up. Once again, that's it.

      First thing is first... I send my sick husband to the walk-in clinic. Even if he wasn't sick they would surely give him antibiotics just to cure his complaining. That over and done with, we then drag him out for an adventuresome day of ... driving our 14 year old SUV around Vancouver... with the new tires and shocks... almost a new vehicle you know. It made the girl happy to go "out"... the boy of course was a little pissed that he had to leave his neighbourhood, because that removes him from the closeness of his computer and playstation time. Boo hoo for you Mr McGoo. That was my grown up answer, be happy with it. Now the fun thing about going out with Mr Husband is the fact that we don't actually go out at all. We all drive in a vehicle... and watch everyone around us "out and about", and we the people on the sidelines are forced to sit in our 14 year old SUV and side smile at people. We ended up at Dundarave, just to drive around a turn about right down at the warf. Hmmmm... look at all the happy smiling people... they are out, well, we must go. Now I must be honest... I believe we were allowed to exit the vehicle at the Clevlend Dam. I think the only reason was the fact that Mr Husband needed to use the facilities. (In fact I don't think we were given the green light to get out... the truck got turned off and I think the rest of us just fell out). At which that point we rushed to see the tourist attraction before he could say this wasn't the place we were stopping. He has a funny habit of saying.. I will show you this place.... so I watch for the place... and then I finally ask.. and then he says, "oh, it was back there". Anyways, I am happy just to be able to look at some nice houses along the waterfront, and thoughts passed through my head that I could thieve some cuttings of some nice perennials if it was closer to the night, but then I have the whole exiting the vehicle problem, so that thought quickly was dismissed . All the same it's a nice drive when the girl (Aka The Pipster) starts to shoot her mouth off that she's hungry, and she'd like to see more people around these parts, and don't they have any parks, and that house looks ugly, and what's so expensive about it here they don't even have enough money to make a straight road... and on and on it went... so I say to Mr. Husband. Alright, things are going bad.. let's get the girl some food, otherwise it will be living hell inside our 14 year old SUV. The man complies, we go to Horseshoe Bay. I was stunned. He delivered.. and without incident I might add. But then again, he isn't thinking straight... he's actually sick, and Dr Walk-in Clinic doubled his antibiotic on the first dose....so now he's got the ..XXXXXX.....so, he needs to use the facilities again anyways. We get out of the vehicle (there was confirmation to open the doors and exit at this time), and we head in 4 different directions..... except that the two adults are the ones with the money, and the penniless children are merrily making their way for fish and chips and pizza. Everybody Stop !!! Let me introduce you two shorter people to something called 'HEALTHY', I took the Pipster with me to watch the sushi guy make some Sushi, and Mr Husband took the boy to purchase some Subway. WE meet up and take our purchases down to the warf/park/patron filled areas/next to the bay. The boy is already asking what time is it, and when will we be heading home, and does he get to have his couple of hours for computer time when we get there, and can he have something to drink, because he didn't get anything, and is it safe to sit by the shore when the ferries are coming and going.....luckily we found our spot, and I told him to stuff his 6 inch sub into his mouth and concentrate on chewing. Please. That said.. the girl is now crazy because the bees are after her. And they are. They are after me. So I close up my Sushi shop and package up her sandwhich and walk her to a table in the shade... and it starts... I hate this place, what a stupid place... the bees are everywhere... and that ferry is going to make the whistle sound, and that whale only has a small spout where the water drizzles out of... look at that park, it's too small for me. Don't ever bring me hear again. I open her sandwhich.... eat this, and I walk away. I sit back down, and look like some obsessive person open and closing my sushi package... the whole while, Mr Husband sits, and eats his sandwhich, not one word, nor one bee. Even the children stay away. Then the screaming starts. Of course the bees have found her again... and she races over to our picnic table... and tosses her sandwhich at us... and then demands that we live this horrible place, and why would we take her here... besides she's like to go to that place..... and points over to the nice and fancy restaurant "The Boathouse". There, I'd like to be in that place she commands. Well, time to go Mr. Husband says. He walks off towards the pier with the boy. I am left with Miss Fancypants herself...Lady Golddigger, Miss Wine and Dine me, Princess Platinum. Great, and we follow the boys to the pier....Well, time to head for home... actually it was quite a nice day... but of course, it's never enough for the Pipster. So, when we get home she starts... I want to go to the water park.. because I have been out all day, and I want to play in the water, and besides all I got to do was go to 3 different places and look at lots of different things, and get to have lunch and a treat, but I didn't get to play at the water park and now I am hot. All the boy wanted to do was get home... I don't know why, because Mr Sarcasm got caught (being rude) and I took away his privileges for his 2 saved hours. Then as soon as he had done it, the sly fox tried to make it seem like a joke. Too late... 2 hours gone... and they wont be coming back. So, now it's late, I'm back from the waterpark, the girl has eaten a piece of steak, so other than choking on it, she's happy. Huh, I just caved. I gave him back his one hour saved from yesterday. (Just because he has beautiful blue eyes, and he's so freaking sensitive and sweeeeett....!!!) I didn't think that was fair... what's fair really?? So, that's the day..... but then again we have to put that little princess to bed yet.... I could be back.

      Hey, this world is a humourous place... that's because people and all that they do are funny. Plain and simple... funny, funny, funny. When things are funny, this makes people laugh. Very simple concept. People are funny, other people laugh. So WWWWHHHYYYYY, is there this constant abuse of lol, or LOL.... I am certain that the when people are delivered a punch line, they will laugh. If they don't get it... they wont laugh. I want to know why I am constantly reminded that people are lol-ing....or need to lol, or pause to lol... there is just too much of it... people need to stop... we are going to pollute this planet by lol-ing on all 176 corners of the earth... what ever became of the simple side smile... :)

      So, I think I have figured out my blog situation. I am not the classic moron that I was thinking that I was. Wow,..... say that 10 times in a row. So now, with patience I think I will add some junk to this junk that I already contribute to. Oh, and I cruised through some of my high interest sites.. and who ever she is in the world hasn't had her baby. Of course that has peaked my interest, although she has already stated it's a girl... where's the fun !! All the same... I keep going back for more. I once again have made that mental note to myself... if I was a cat I would be dead. I had to call my friend to confirm that she was infact going out on a date. So she invited me to come over so she could model some of her wardrobe. She's a size 9...what could she not look good in. I wouldn't be visiting today. Nothing of extreme interest happened today.. but then I would have to leave my home to find that sort of thing. I had a vacation day today.. and where did I spend it... at home. Only because Mr Man needed to fix our 14 year old vehicle before our VACATION that starts next week... oh, I will add the dates... it is quite extensive, and the planning has been exhausting, so we have come up with the itinerary, I hope that all the people will be able to keep up... July 7th to the 11th. Did you get all that???? I am sure that it will take him the next four days to continue on with his preparations, I am not certain why I even agreed to go.. he's going to make me crazy just watching him.... and now I have to spend time with him to... ? So, the girl decided that at 10 to 10 tonight that I needed to take her out for a ride in the now new shocked vehicle. So she proclaims that she is not going to bed until someone gets her out of here.... because she has not gone anywhere yet today...I pity the poor man that agrees to be with this young lady... if they don't come equipped with two bank accounts and a rich uncle... things will never work... but she will have a good time along the way. So we're driving down our little country road... and she says... "Do you think anybody will notice I'm not wearing underwear?" Hmmmm. Let's answer that .... she's just had a bath/shower, she's 7, and blond, yes, a big thick head of blond hair. Need I write more ?? So then I ask her where she thinks I'm taking her... we were just out for a test drive after all.  So she says; "Well, since we were out... could we stop by the sushi place, at least my feet are clean" she answered. My Little Pip, always the comedian. That's a rap for the day... more happened, but I am just not motivated to continue on.... these keys keep transposing themselves... so it's more work backspacing than typing !!! And then there's still the spellcheck thing.....

      Why oh why do I have grey hair? Why is it that everytime I add something to my blog, the edges go square? Why can't I figure out how to add smiley add ons... I am forced to view my blog with many yawns... I keep digging for details to make it exciting.. I will not find it with my drool that I call writing. I view through my travels the exciting finds.. which of course I haven't been able to add to mine. This makes me crazy..as I continually see my shades of green I have been able to post a few pictures, which some may have seen. I want to download images from my Microsoft Word... I don't think I can... unless some else has otherwise heard I work in colour... a rainbow of shades as big as the sky... Which none seem to emerge, as much as I try. I am tired of this blog... and the limitations before me Any word from the wise that can be delivered to thee?

      The pause that refreshes.... we went to the mall. Other regular people are at water parks, and swimming pools.. and lakes even... we go to the mall. But I can tell you something... the shorter versions of myself were actually in quite a jovial mood. I can't imagine that has something to do with fact that they are spending all of my make believe money... they don't get that kind of stuff. I eventually put a hault on the day when Mr Hungry-for-something-from-A&W wanted the supersonic meal.. me being the perfectly practical parent.... asked the A&amp;W girl.... so how much is all of his food going to cost... "Well, with tax it will be $7.14" Thanks, but forget it.... he can have a kiddie meal.... that's a baby burger with cheese, small fries a rootbeer and a cookie... for $3.49. That sounds more like it. The Pipster only eats at one place..and has done for years.... the chinese food place.. where she can get chicken balls, sweet and sour sauce and noodles with stuff in them. With all of the other really bad food choices available to her she seems to come back to this one.. on the occasion that we visit the foodfair, and actually buy food.. not scurry past it running to get to the other end of the mall.  I had no intention of buying them lunch today at the mall, nor did I have the intention of doing back to school shopping.... at all... I didn't intend on spending a great deal of time at the mall.... but the troops were happy with the temporary relief from the heat... and I was temporarily relieved by their little fits of turmoil that both of them find themselves in. They got all kinds of good stuff.. and I got a bag of cotton balls and some dish soap... and a new battery for my camera.. lucky day for me!!! Oh I lie... and, and, and.... bags for the vacuum...........I must leave to rejoice in my happiness... and throw a party so I can take pictures, clean up the dishes.. and vacuum after the guests have gone !!!! Ha!

      I have been doing some research.... that would be... reading people's blog, but I'll call it research all the same. I have some concerns. You will have to stay hair to read them... are you hairing me? Now this could all be a classic case of coincidence... but there's a alot of hair problems out there. Now I am not just talking about the ooppsss I'm havin a shitty hair day... this is downright problematic "oh no I woke up again and the hair looks shittier than yesterday problems". I thinks it's become to an epidemic porportions..... who reports this to the World Health Organization?? This is going to have an impact on our quality of life.... can you imagine the line-ups at government agents offices.... or what about customs.... or what getting your passport renewed.......big and little malls all over North America.... and gas stations.... even the Library lineups will grow....our whole work force will come to a crawling hault..... and why.. because everyone will be having bad hair days. It's the government agents I am most concerned about....they only serve about 3 people a day.... thats because other duties of their employment involves water fountain duty.. and hover and cover other peoples work space...some of the day.. then take a break.... then serve someone.. and that's the trouble.. one wrong comment by Joe Public... and it's a nervous breakdown for the employee....HOW DARE YOU STARE AT ME LIKE THAT..... I AM ONLY TRYING TO HELP YOU..... CAN'T YOU SEE   I'M HAVING A BAD HAIR DAY !!!!!  This is the trouble I am talking about.... it's only going to get worse... well except at fast food outlets across the world... they go to work everyday with a net over their head which gives them bad hair, and can still somehow manage a smile and a perky voice through their headsets..... so where are all these people now when we need them at the government agents office.

      What do you get when a group of hot people are left waiting for a really really long time in a waiting room to see the same person??? The room fills up with idiots and morons and sighers and huffy people and whiners, and people that want to talk about their road trip to the office... and one wonderful Grampa who is nervously rocking a 3 month old baby, who was 6 weeks premature.. and looks like a one month old..  and is getting very hungry, very fast....  but nothing takes cake other than a Frenchman that takes his seat who is a diabetic to see a Dr. with his non-english speaking wife. Now this is the freaking freakiest... shall I saying "f...g" moron you've ever seen your life.....  And I was glad to sit and witness it all !!!    First of all he comes in... speaking in french..... the reception girl says I don't understand French... he starts to yell.... then he says he needs to go get something to eat because he is a diabetic, and he needs his insulin (SOOOO, in my head I start to say to him... listen here you goddamn moron.........it's not anyones fault that you are late, and hungry and de-insulinized..... it is 10:00 in the morning.. and if you couldn't get your shit together... then don't come up here and start yelling at the reception.... did your mother never tell you to take RESPONSIBILITY for yourself.... freakin f...g fool. God!) But I only thought that.... because freak wife is muttering under her breath crashing into all the people that are whining in the room... excluding Mr Amazingly-composed Grampa... and the sweet itsy-bitsy baldy baby.----- So the fight carries on... he yells at the receptionist... eyes are darting all over the place... then the reception yells... go sit down and take a seat... you are really starting to piss me off...!!! So now the crazy man crashes past some people.... and hits an elderly with the door on the way out... the crazy wife crashes past people.. then they blast back into the place... make people move.. so they can sit down again. Now he decides to give himself an insulin shot... so of course one of the whining people start yelling... " You couldn't go do that in the bathroom..."  as he sits their with his shirt up jamming an epipen into his abdoman....more yelling between the "patrons" of this 6 x 9 palace !! Then theirs an emergency meeting with the Doc's and the receptionist... the patient that was already being seen by the Dr gets booted out of the office... and these people hauled in... more yelling...... the dusts settles everyone goes back to their respective places.... well the two moronic frenchpeople... now the people in the office are standing yelling at the receptionist.. how long is this gonna take... one guy leaves... more people are coming in.....WOW... this was great...the clincher....  The girls turn is next... I have been waiting for about an hour and 30 minutes... a half hour to get to the office.. a half hour return.... so were up to 2 1/2 hours all for a .... 5 minute appointment... WOW... that is so worth it. Then I find out that he is moving his office in October... down to St Paul's Hospital.... (which takes about an hour to get to.. paying more money for parking.. if you can find parking.... then waiting in this chaos)... just to have Mr Dr. Orthopedic Surgeon say to the girl that he certainly remembers her from her extended stay in the cast clinic.... to look at her arm.. to check if it's growing.. and were done...so guess where I won't be going a year from now?

      Today I will take my boring self, in our 14 year old boring SUV and the Pip (who has suddenly turned boring... only temporarily), to the boring orthopedic surgeon that fixed her very boring broken arm back in boring March. Then I will have to be witness to a very boring conversation between the boring surgeon and his boring resident, who will recite the boring case of the boring broken ulna and snapped radial head of a 6 year old boring female. They will take boring measurements of her boring range of motion, and will comment on her boring lack of flexion to the shoulder. Which will bring about the boring conversation as to whether I took her to a boring physiotherapist who hungrily ate up my cash flow to visit and talk with my boring daughter for fifteen boring minutes. I can't wait for rush of boring details to abound me today. HA !  Dont fear those out their... I am not in a funk...... I am just in awe of other people lives... and the excitement that unfolds for them each day.... today I want to be an Olympic Athlete... that would be so unboring.  Actually this little surgeon man will remember my Pip... he always does.. he was so frightened by her... that the day we went to the "cast clinic".... he sicked his resident on us.... and wished him luck..... only to run in and out of the room... that's it.... she turned a 10 minute visit into a 5 1/2 tour..... what's not to remember about the crazy blond child...... Ha ha........

      I would like to thank who ever I need to send my thanks to in giving me/us the good sense to stop at creating two children.  First of all Miss Pip should have come first, and secondly she should have been an only child. I mean, she ultimately believes she is an only child, with a slightly older short-haired male version that takes up her space when she wants it. With Afraid-of-the-dark boy who is away visiting at the moment... the Pip's personality has changed. She's reasonable, approachable, non-confrontational, cooperative, helpful, a pleasure to talk to, even tempered, a little lady with manners and polite.  ALL RIGHT, WHO STOLE MY CHILD.... WHO EVER HAS HER.. CAN KEEP HER....   I LIKE THIS LITTLE GIRL .     I  am not certain how long this sweetness-invasion will continue to possess this needy blond child... but it can stay as long as it takes... I am enjoying this little holiday. Some things I got accomplished earlier.................   Paid bills on the computer  Renewed my library books on the computer  Recharged my telephone on the computer  Talked to some friends on the computer  Won a million dollars on the computer  Lied about number 5 on the computer   I had a fight with "Melanie" today. "Melanie" is the automated voice girl for my cell phone. I pissed "Melanie" off so bad today she put me on hold.... forever... then came back in her sickly-sweet- grenedine voice and told me that nobody was available to help me. Does this sound bad:  I was sitting in my 14 year old SUV, with the windows opn... yelling   "GIVE ME A HUMAN, I JUST WANT A HUMAN TO TALK TO.. I CAN'T TALK TO MELANIE... BECAUSE SHE CAN'T ANSWER MY QUESTIONS..... GIVE ME A HUMAN.... , GIVE ME A FREAKING HUMAN TO TALK TO!!!!" that was me in the parking lot of Ikea.... so I decided that I would have to take this phone call inside the store.... that way I would have to beg and plead for a human to come on the line and I wouldn't have a heart attack/stroke in the parking lot trying to get "Melanie" to take me off of hold. I am way more civilized in front of other people; who wouldn't hesitate to call 911 and point and scream that there's a crazy woman in Ikea.  You know... there's so many days I write about Pip and her personality... I have no idea where she gets it from............???

      Still have that headache.. more of a neckache.. won't spend much time here... maybe I'll leave the transposed letters... always looking for an effect...... that'll be fun. Kind of nervous... it's just the crazy blond girl and me... the house is very silent... except for her morning shows that she likes to watch... (shows that have (evil) high pitched voice overs for characters...) I don't have to wear a referree shirt... or in the girls case, wear a white T-shirt and sway to and fro when her world starts to implode, or a cross around my neck, or carry a peace sign in my pocket to flash at her.... I'm thinking that the queen of the castle is rejoicing in her aloneness. I am certain though, that if I do not go along with misconceptions of what HER day will turn out like... I could be shredded.. she is rather cat like.... and I am her favourite couch.

      I have a super sonic impossibly inhumane gargantuan tremendously huge freakin beyond belief to the moon and past it then back again gigantic HEAD ACHE. Yes, I do.  I did something totally weird today.... I carried a big big umbrella around in the boiling heat. Yes some of YOU BC'ers will laugh... and laugh heartily... because yes, I admit I used a big big  umbrella in the boiling heat. Why........ for no reason now..... see the above comment... which is what I was trying to avoid...  by using the big big umbrella.   We went to the Vancouver Zoo.... where I know it was hot.. and I just don't do hats... hats make my hair flat..........I'd rather carry a big big umbrella... you stand out that way... some people even told me that I was smart... I don't know.... instant shade.... I think one lady really wanted to take it, ( her eyes were pretty bugged out.. and her hands were reaching their way over ).... and a cover for your head when you watch the birds of prey show.. and they swoop practically right on your head......  Weirdness counts in this world....more people will talk about the crazy lady with the big big umbrella than the lady with the pink backpack... (me as well)... but I had to icepacks sitting right at the back of it.... so it was a refreshing carrying device....  That's it for me... more stories to type....but can't.. I will go and find my peppermint stick to roll on my neck... and then of course go and find some drugs.... my next motto in life is definitely "living better through pharmaceuticals"   : )         : )

      You know I have been looking at Maggiezfarm the last couple of days... I like her pictures of her sunrises and sunsets. Magical, mysterious, magnificent... and I am thinking that I need to send my 7 year-old-princess-doll-Pipster-way-to-mouthy-and-not-yet-learning-that-she-needs-to-be-polite-at-all-times to go and have a little sebaticle at Maggiezfarm. Besides Miss Pip looked at the pictures.. and she quite liked them. She asked me if we could take some pictures similar to those..... it didn't take me long to get me thinking..... Would you like to go their sweet heart... for a little nice vacation... would ya... I know you would... off you go now... where all the colours are pretty... sweet little girl..... SO THAT YOUR MOTHER DOESN'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE NONE STOP ASKING FOR THINGS EVERY TIME WE LEAVE THE HOUSE.... you have a good time at Maggiezfarm.. don't forget to take lots of pictures... and don't worry about your plane ticket home... I will eventually get around to purchasing it... really little princess.... well maybe little princess.... I hope to get around to it... that's if I write it down or something.... or, if one of your friends asked why you haven't returned from your extended vacation.... or........maybe if daddy wonders why your room has remained clean for an extended period of time... like a week or two.... and this is how the story started.... The girl is going to a scrapbooking adventure which she is quite excited about. I bought her a disposable camera so she could scrapbook up some of her "Pip Pic's"...... things were good the first time we went to save-on-foods as we dropped the film off... but then later on... we needed to pick the film up... which required standing at checkout counters... with many many things to be bought... or in the pips case to be drooled over and enticed by. WE had a couple other grocery items to pick up... and then she starts.... can I have this, can I have this, can I have this, what about this, what about this, what about this.. I like this, I like this, I like this, I like this........I give her her pictures... I point, go stand over their.. hopefully someone will take you.............and off she goes. I take my bags, my Mr Archie-comic son and one demon home. From the back seat, she begins to hiss about things... whatever is on her mind... and that's when she was hit with a piece of my mind..... unfair fight.. too bad so sad.. I'm the Mommy. (at this point my philosphy for her was you get what you give.... and I gave it to her... thankfully that shut her up). Until it came to dinner.....once again... the demon approached the table dressed as a Pipster... very quickly the demon was commanded to leave the table to go to it's room... to come back as the Pipster. Eventually the Pip emerged from her littly tidy haven called a bedroom..... and I decided that I liked her again.... we both decided to go bear watching. Good show tonight... spotted a MaMa with her two cubs..... cool, cool, cool. You know, come to think of it... how do mother bears tell their youngster to hit the road.. don't they just kind of roar at them... and scare them off a bit..... similar to my tactics of the day.... so now I own a demon-bear????? ha ha ha !

      It's quite late at night as I gaze at this screen Taking a quick tour of my favourite blogs that are green... My friend finds me awake, and we chat for a little online We eventually agree that it really should be someones bedtime. As I reach for my mouse to say good night.... I hear a small sound... which gave me a small fright.. What is that sound I say as I strain to hear... Will it happen again, is it from far or is it near... It certainly isn't the snoring that come in waves from down the hall... It seems to be coming from just the other side of this wall.... With an imagination as big as the sky Thoughts of weird creatures make their way past my eyes.. I blink my eyes hard, and shake those images from my head.. It is really late, and I should really go to bed. I wait for the sound to happen again, My eyes spot the clock and now it's 2:10 Enough is enough, this is the end of that sound No more sitting a waiting, no more horsing around. Finally it comes to me, I know what I am hearing.... It's LP, our german shepherd, in her wicker basket she is stirring. With a quick click of the mouse, to disconnect and say bye. Now I will go, and get some shut eye.

      I am, right now..(self-imposed).... supposed to putting together a very powerful resume. Clearly that doesn't interest me... in the slighest... at all......what I should be doing is plucking my way through the thesaurus pulling out words that might describe who I am, my accomplishments, intriguing eye catching words that would make these people (aka the employer) feel like they have been missing out... for a real long time... but no... I am here... checking out my green bloggers of the world list... and looking for ways to make changes... to my blog... not to my person or my resume. I know myself... (because I have looked in the mirror a couple of times... ) and I will get up tomorrow morning and begin to throw words all over my current resume.... print and print and print... Oh, of course I will hiss and swear and his and swear, and probably slam some paper around, drink way too much coffee... be interrupted 39 times..and go to the bathroom twice... all of these tactics will work... after all, I am working with a computer... so, on that note... I will continue on my peaceful meandurings of blogging entertainment.. to await the torture that I will put myself through tomorrow morning....no side smile included with this one.

       A couple of points from the day:   The girl has decided that her bathing suit is her active wear. Should I be frightened by that?  My children both now have those spinning toothbrushes  (fresh out of the cereal boxes) that clean their teeth all sparkly and smooth..... now I can stare at their sweet little smiles and actually be happy at looking at their teeth, not the leftover yellowy junk from last weeks pizza party.... eeeeewwwwwwweeeeeeeeee !!!!  My hair is the same colour today.... once again I have coloured it with fade resistant permanent colour..... I wonder if this box is going to be another lying liar cardboard smiling liar girl with a different hair product plastered on her head.... will be able to tell you tomorrow.... that's if I feeling like washing my hair... it might be nice to have the same hair colour for two days in row..... something about that consistancy thing that I can't seem to get over.  The girls bedroom is clean... and I had nothing to do with it... how many side smiles can I fit on this page anyways....  :):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):)   I have another tomato that is ripening... I am wondering if I will get to it, before the evil queen Cicely the tomato eating dog sniffs it out and eats it. She has eaten all of them so far. That would be the reason why I quit growing cucumbers, strawberries and zuchinni. I think the actual problem here is that she doesn't know that she's a dog... and "Dog's eat dog food".... she doesn't know that. I have to admit... the corn on the cob hasn't peaked her interest. Oh, but of course the pumpkins are kind of neat... just when you have lost all of the tennis balls in the yard.. she can wander over and pick herself a new ball.  I see the girl making her way home from her friends house... I will have to go.... I am sure she will need to be driven to see the bears.... I can just hear her now.....

      Last week I was going to clean the girls room. I never accomplished that task.... similar to climbing mountain everest... something that you don't just jump into, or take lightly.. there is much preparation for this kind of adventure. Sponsors and support systems need to be in place, determining your climbing course, preparing your climbing team and fine tuning plans. I had not completed all these tasks prior to the date of clean-up, hence the operation was shut down. Gladly to be taken over by:  Mr husbandcleanuptheroonanddoareallyreallygoodjobrightdowntothebitterend . Once again, I am glad to be at work today... where nobody knows where I am. .... I  feel that beautiful side smile sneaking up again !!  :) :) :) :) :)

      The blogger world just doesn't remember me... every time I sign in... I hit the "remember me" button which prooves to be useless. It doesn't know I exist... then..... While I am at work, the second I walk away.... "is Deanna here"??   I  HAVE  BEEN  HERE  ALL  DAY !!!!! I am always here... here I am here I am here I am.... hopefully someone or something will remember.      But, what I do know is that my cleaning friends wont be coming over tomorrow... only because Mr Superkitchencleaninghomecleaningtidymanhusband has been home for the last two days... so that little 1350 square foot house of mine will sparkle. I like being at work, where nobody knows I'm here... yes, that brings a side smile to my face really fast :)   :)    :)     :)

      AAAHHH !!!!! I just so much dislike the Superstore... I like to call it the Stupidstore... it's stupid. And don't worry about investigating that accusation... it's all true.  EXCEPT...  when you run into a long-lost friend.. and then stand and talk to her for one and a half hours in an isle. Then it's not so stupid... it's a Longlost Store. The whole reason I spied her was the fact that I couldn't stand looking through racks of kids sale clothes... I can't stand that kind of stuff... so I decided to go and look for some scrapbooking junk... that's when I spied this girl with even brown coloured hair that was nicely parted on the sides.. and that's when we looked at one another... and it was al over for that isle for a while !!! I am so glad she commented about how I hadn't changed...(well she was wearing glasses.. so I will cut her some slack.. after all.. I do have the rainbow effect happening on my hair again, hence the reason I was admiring her one-coloured deep brown hair)... and I know I didn't have the rainbow-effect when I last saw her !!!  Seeing her made my day!!!! But then again.. winning the $29 million from the lotto 649 would make me happier...... so for the time being she has made my day...

      My sister tells me to be ready at 0915 SHARP. There's no pissing around with the sis... she's doing the driving... so we better be ready.. that is until we get the phone call from the time announcer.. that she will be late. CRAP!!!! I was right on the moola with the whole time constraint.. I had the two people ready and raring to go... stuff packed.. and she is already screwing with the plans.. without further delay we make it to the beach.. it is really cloudy afterall.... great day to spend at the beach... and it's nice and windy to boot. Even more special. "Can I borrow you Parka???" I asked the Late-Sis. An unevenful day... I like those kinds... no blood, no guts.. no stories to come home with...... other than I was insistant that I wanted to watch the tide come in ... it is kind of freaky to be caught out on the sandbars as the tide comes in... kind of "Chitty-Chitty Bang-bangish"... only in real life !!!! anyways... the Late-sis youngest boys decides he needs to go the bathroom... I decide that I will go with him since I was practically going to pee my pants myself....well that only took three hours too long.. we get back.. when did the tide come in????... I ask...so, now we are cleaning up from our excursion... that's nice... I realize... I guess I put on that sunscreen a little bit too late..... I didn't' think I had that much sun... apparently I did... glad I put it on when I did... today at work.. people were asking me where I had been... (It's been very cloudy here for the past 5 days.... so it's clear to me that nobody knows about our secret beach.....)... as I radiate today under the flourescent lights... what a pretty sight!!!! Even the Pip managed to contain herself yesterday... well that was until we got home.. and had to shower and bathe the beastly child and apply thirteen dozen different creams and lotions and powders for all of her week-long-acquired-ailments... I even managed to shampoo her wack of sea-smelling hair. Yesterday was a good day...

      I want to know how it is that you can be late for work... when all you have to do is get yourself to work... that's it.. no making lunches, doing hair of blond Pipsters.. no waking up very tired boys, no putting in a load of laundry before you go off to work... no dropping off children somewhere to be looked after for the day... why is it that you can't get yourself to work on time???  Just a curiosity of mine.. it doesn't matter really...nobody notices if I'm not their on time anyways.. they will notice eventually when they have to start doing my work....this post is dedicated to LUJZA.

      I can't believe it's Friday... where did yesterday go... I didn't write anything... which does not equate to "I didn't have anything to say."... because that just wouldn't happen to me. I have lots to say, lots to report... I just didn't FEEL like it. If you don't FEEL the moment, it just doesn't happen...  what I felt like doing was being a Lounge Lizard. Yes, say it again... Lounge Lizard.. let those l's roll off your tongue.. and feel what it would be like to sitting back in a comfortable suit, drinking a grenedine stained umbrella drink, eyes criss-crossing across the bar, watching the comings and goings of the people around you... all the while.. listening to hit songs from the days before you were born. Yes, that was the persona that I took on last evening.... playing my digital piano (with earphones). Yes, just me and my Reader's Digest Book of Big Hits....you know, I sounded great... because the only one hearing it was me... similar to singing in the shower...I even took requests from my imaginary audience.... "aaaawwww... look at the happy couple... this song goes out to them"..... Smoke Get's In Your Eyes... bumbled from my fingertips......" everyone look over their.. check out that smile".... as Mona Lisa burped it's way onto the keyboard......I livened up the group with my "Midnight Special" which is crusing along just nicely.. and writing of crusing...... "Cruising Down the River".. managed to make a half-assed appearance across the keyboard as well. Not to be outdone by Sir Elton John and his Candle in the Wind.............so a little glimpse into my life..... until our friends came along around 10:00 last night and delivered me and Mr Cleankitchen-husband-man some VANILLA COKE (DIET FOR ME.. MORE CHEMICALS FOR ME... I MIGHT LIVE LONGER !!!!). Oh how I love Vanilla Diet Coke from the woman who is drinking a Extra Hard Cider Pineapple-Guava flavour at this exact moment !!!! So, just to keep my blogging friends happy (Lujza), I will write another post. Stay tuned... for those that care to stay tuned (Lujza).

        BLOGMARE !!!!!   Today is the day that it rained down on me Little did I know it would bring me no glee, For today is the day that I thought  the rain would be good To keep our world green, and that it would..... Today is the day that on a whim I pressed a key which made me quite grim Today is the day that with all my finessing Left me with lots of green, and a whole lot of guessing Today is the day that I lost my gadgets, buttons and lists Where will I retrieve them, who will I remember and who will I miss?? Today is the day that a fright made a dare...... To turn my  regular day into a  living blogmare.

      I have no patience... I have none... not sure why.. I just don't have any... I've been through this before.. won't write about it again...anyways.... I am reading my "favourites" list.... my private little stash of bloggy things to read about... and people don't post.. how can you not post... for many many days... now I am kind of crazy over this. Not kind of... there's no half-way with me.... it's all the way baby !!!! I love to read peoples thoughts, their doings, their inner selves exposed to a world where the colours pink and blush have no meaning here !!!!! I am a people watcher... therefore I am a reader... and I want to read !!!! People give me something to read !!!! Oh, and of course thank you to those that give me something to read.... you know... because I have left you a comment.... !!!!! So... back to the business of the day... Miss Pipster and I took two trips down to "Bear Alley"... we saw some huge one walking out in the blueberry fields... and then I drove down the "authorized vehicles only" lane.. and showed her the incident spot... (and to see if we could salvage any left over skin... she's lacking still....) then I showed her where the bears were... she said she was glad I made her hurry in all her screamingness... !!!! WE went back later tonight.. and then cruised some little dead end streets way up on the mountain.. and sure enough... just take a guess what popped out of the bushes... just guess.. really.. guess........ A BEAR. So we cruise down the hill quietly... and she once again wanted to sit up on the roof through the sunroof... crazy kid... we get up nice and close ... and the little guy is just standing their.. eating berries... enjoying an evening snack... when he realizes we are there... he high-tales it back into the bushes. Once again.. it was great seeing another bear !!!! Believe it or not, we live in a subdivision... which is close to the base of a mountain, that is attached to many dykes.. and agricultural land reserve, and acres of blueberry farms, which is right next to the dykes.. which is right next to miles and miles of wilderness.. hence the bear issue. I love it.. wouldn't change it.... except of course one night when ONE made their way into my front yard and stole my apples.... not nice... !!!  My thought of the day... keep clicking till it hurts, eventually you will become numb.

      Today so far there is nothing to write about. Even the weather is easy to figure out. It's raining. And it's sunny. It all makes sense. The girl is loaded with Polysporin in numerous locations. I have managed to deny access to the bandage box in an effort to have her remain in a moveable state. Otherwise she would have so many bandaids wrapped around her I would be calling her "Mommy". She does have one bandaid on... in fact she has a strip attached to her that I can't remove... I am actually wondering, how long does a bandaid stick before it unsticks... luckily it isn't covering the part of her arm (outer layer of skin) this is actually missing. That is where their is a bandaid... covering what isn't their anyways. That location doesnt have polysporin. Antibiotic ointment their... only because I couldn't get any of the dirt off from the "splat-attack where bears stare" took place.  WE were doing their school work this morning.... the Pip managed to do some... or should that be "sum"... kind of impressed,"little-miss-impossible" was quite happy to sit and learn some numbers...The boy on the other hand.... I'm trying to get him to learn his times tables... so how many times will I need to ask him the same question before he remembers.....because I have asked him close 357 trillion times his two times tables... and the lightbulb is still just kind of flickering......BUT ....you let that boy hear someones "accent" for a split second, or quote a punch line from a joke that you heard 13 days ago... and he's got it all going on. I think it's getting close to hammer time. Ha!

      So, my ambition for the day was to clean the Pip's room. This isn't just a room... it's a trap, a jungle, a mecca of intricate designs & sticky of trickery consisting of barbies & little things... and more little pieces that go with the little things, then of course their's her other "stuff". Cleaning her home requires patience, know-how, drive, willingness, obsessive-compulsive behaviours, 13 garbage bags, a good memory and an organized brain. The pipster doesn't possess any of these qualities. NONE, can't find them anywhere..... they're not even lost in her room. Instead of cleaning on this beautiful day, the girl and I ventured out for a bikeride... (I can live with that room like that for a couple more hours). Everything was happening along fine.... well except the fact that we rode to far... kind of into bear territory... but I didn't want to go back... through the bear territory either... hmmm... anyways... we were just turning the corner, and found pavement... when the Pipster flies through the air... and then skids down a little hill. SCREAM ! Scream, scream, scream.................. shit I would have been screaming too. I pull out my nice and wet washcloth... and the water bottle, and the bandaids... I was going to start piecing the girl back together. ... Pip... get on your bike and ride little lady.... there's bears.... a mama and two babies... just ride little girl.... and THEN I STARTED TALKING REALLY REALLY LOUD... AND KEPT ON TALKING AND TALKING.. AND WHERE THE HELL IS EVERYONE TODAY.. DON'T THEY KNOW IT'S SUNDAY... AND PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS AROUND HERE ON SUNDAYS..........that girl is amazing... battered and bloodied and hurt... and we just kept going.. she wasn't willing to stop... anywhere.... well, until we were just about up the a corner... when out walked another bear... shit again... we got off our bikes.. and walked backwards.....we made it down to someones driveway and stood their. In the distance I could see more bikeriders.....there were three of them... a woman, her daughter... and a guy.... "you might want to wait for a minute... there's a bear just at the edge of the ditch".... the mom and girl stop... the guy keeps riding....  he slows then turns around... did you say a bear.... "Thanks for putting on those listening ears" I said to him... kind of rude.. but I was kind of still in a tizzy from our encounter just five minutes before. The five of us stopped their, a car had been sitting at the side of the road...he had put his hazards on... finally he left... we all proceeded together as a group. The guy offered to go first... and I'll have to admit.. not a talkative bunch... idiots! The mother rode ahead of her daughter... and yet I rode behind mine.... (my theory being that I COULD SEE if the girl turned into bearbait... not just hear the after-effects!).... I kept on talking.... and talking... they remained silent.. Nice... real nice people.. nothing like SNEAKING UP ON A BEAR !!!!!.........anyways,  I am still typing so you know the and of the story... but do you........ way later on... after Pip had had a chance to put 5 washclothes all over her wounds to let them rinse.. and one bandaid (and I am not certain how I will be getting it off)... to cover her roadrash... we DROVE back to the park. Again, we managed to spot another bear wander across the road... and this time Pip sat up on top of truck's sunroof... and watched it eat blueberries. Fun stuff... glad we can talk about it.

      I am not feeling good today... I am very frightened... there is tension in my fingertips.. I keep passing hot thru cold.... then I sigh. This is the day... that I have been dreading for some weeks, and I knew it was coming... I kept waiting and watching, and watching and waiting... every day I knew it was one day closer. Why does this day have to be here... can't we just skip at it... and move on to tomorrow.. I wont miss today... I have nervous ripped from my head to my toes... even my hair is nervous... because it has a very different wave in it today. I have pangs of dread coming up through my stomach.... just to swallow them down... so they can come back up again. This dread has been growing for some weeks... and it is here upon me today.... this is the day....   THAT I CLEAN THE GIRLS ROOM.
