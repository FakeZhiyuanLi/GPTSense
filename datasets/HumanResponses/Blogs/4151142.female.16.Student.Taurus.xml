      Just got this blog! Weeeeeeeeeeeeeee!  From Chris's journal:after no food, kate and i rolled up to petes garage and counted merch with dan. when i say merch i mean piles of thousands and thousands of shirts, hoodies, belts and the rest of the crap they sell. i was a bit intimidated by the 6 foot tall heap of hoodies that jordan mercilessly tossed around thinking "someone else will count this", somehow we got talked into being that someone. kids, if you ever buy anything from fob chances are it will come with all of our sweat.  Jordan's reply: you did not need to count anything, i do not know what that shit is about. Probably dan just being a moron, as that seems to be his m o.  More from Chris's journal: i got errands done and pete calls to see if we want to do backing vocals on some of the new demos. since he knows im a fat bastard lying around probably watching one of the simpson family on tv, i agree. late of course he calls and tells me that he'll be over in 15 minutes to pick me up and to wear shitty clothes because apparently "we'll be painting backdrops". he calls and tells me hes waiting out front...i was outside eating pizza and i hear this "pop pop pop" coming from the alley. then something hits me in the back and im like, fuck that the shit?!?! then i get hit in the hand and it hurts like FUCK, i duck behind some cars and when i look up and see pete with a paintball gun laughing his ass off while patricks films of course for the clandestine dvd. im actually pretty pissed for a good 10 seconds but since he keeps firing i cant get close enough to stab him. me, pete and charlie drive patrick home, gossip like girls and tell funny boobies stories. we go to petes house and he goes inside and of course i get the gun and when he walks out i shoot his ass too. in the hand. he laughs and i piss on the van. we come home and pete starts shooting things all over our apt. yes, theres orange paint smears and holes in my walls now. but pete lets me shoot him point blank in the ass. good times. we shoot the el train and film everything. pete leaves. charlie talks to his online girlfriends and im left cleaning up paint. we didnt get to do vocals because theyre not finished and i didnt get to paint. this is my night.    hahahahaha holy moly. I laughed so hard when I read that. I've read it like 4 times. I CAN'T wait for the Clandestine dvd. Its going to be so much better than the FOB one. A lot funnier.  Parents and brother went to b-ball game. I didn't want to go because I have to get up uber early tomorrow. Alicia got to see Patrick and Nemo today. kdfhklashfk I want to see Nemo.
