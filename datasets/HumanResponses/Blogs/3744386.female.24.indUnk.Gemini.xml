      Well, been working from 8am this morning, and now almost 11pm… tired and really numb… and sleepy…  My friends always ask me, how come I’m getting fairer and fairer day-by-day? Well most likely my answer will be, I don’t really have a chance to see the sun… left home for work before sunrise and going back home only after sunset… Looking up into the sky, well, at least I can see the Moon :)    My mom used to say my home is just like my hotel… I’m feeling sorry… Anyway, I’m going home now…

      Music is not an easy thing depends on what you want and how you see it…   Teaching is not an easy thing, good or bad, there’s an influence on the children, so what you want…?  Yep, depends on what I want.   So I chose to use all my heart to do whatever thing I do…  Who ever can see and feel my heart, I thank you and appreciate it…  For those who don’t, and I wish you good luck in your journey of life…

      But I say to you that hear, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. To him who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from him who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt. Luke 6:27-29

      There's a way~~  God will make a way  Where there seems to be no way He works in ways we cannot see He will make a way for me  He will be my guide  Hold me closely to His side With love and strength for each new day  He will make a way~ He will make a way~~  By a road way in the wilderness He’ll lead me Rivers in the desert will I see Heaven and earth will fade But His words will still remain He will do something new today~~~    Well, there’s always a way out for problems… no matter how worst it is… keep the faith and strength… and He’ll bring you through... the best way…

      Judge not, and you will not be judged; condemn not, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven; give, and it will be given to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap. For the measure you give will be the measure you get back. Luke 6:37-38

      Remembered how I used to reject HIM! I was more like a freethinker before and no doubt; I used to anti Christ! Jesus! How can a blind leading another blind self to go to elsewhere?  But thank goodness, I’m now His disciple!  Remembered someone told me ‘You don’t believe in Him because you never experienced Him, you’ll not experience Him if you don’t put your trust in Him!’  For those who have faith in Christ are blessed, you’ll receive His blessing in many ways, truly! I’ve experienced His words in many ways and there are lots more to learn about Him. I’m here to do His work and do my best to glorify His name, and I know I’m blessed through Jesus name.  I have just received a small half-year bonus and a salary increment yesterday. This is the second bonus and the third salary increment that I had within one-year of my work here in this company and of my trust in Christ! Yes, I’ve received the most precious gift in this world last year! 31st Aug 2003 to be exact.  You may see this as a reward of my hard work or just, I’m simply in the luck. But, to me, I clearly know that this is a goodness from God, and I know that this monthly income increment is not for my own pleasure, but to enable me to have the pleasure to do good for others, through His name. To make others blessed while I’m receiving the blessing from God. Yeah, Amen!  All in all, to evangelize is a must for me, but whether you believe it or not, it’s God’s work. Yes, HE may just touch your heart and open up your mind someday to lead you to The World Of Lord!  You are a Christian because God has chosen you. So let’s praise The Lord!  Cheers to whoever who had read through this message! Best wishes

      Was listening to Smashing Pumpkins last night, flashed back a story of my life, sad, yet I can’t do anything, I didn’t want to do anything, it wouldn’t help though… so just let it be and let time to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;it. &nbsp;  Just into the music… capturing the lyrics…  &nbsp;  blank page is all the rage…. never meant to say anything... in bed I was half dead…. tired of dreaming of rest… got dressed drove the state line….  &nbsp;  Well, I do believe that God will bring me through… I hold His words tightly… yet again, I fell asleep with tears… &nbsp;   But I know I'll be good tomorrow.

      Like a kampung girl in town, who she’s familiar and good at everything in her own kampung but when she had a look at the world outside… it’s like… Wow! Wa… Hmm…?! huh?!?! Like that also can ahh? ooOooo…  Interesting…   Well, just too many things that I don’t know about and they are new to me… And finally came into my mind with this thought…  The more I know, the more I realized that things that I knew are just too little…
