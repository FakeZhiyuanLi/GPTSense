       I'm not really, but this is just proof that you can never trust the people you read on the internet.  I was talking to a lady today about her 15 year old son and how he and his friends were using the words 'gay' and 'little bitch' to describe portion size.  Now, I'm not such a fan of 'gay' but  little bitch ?  I'm totally going to use that next time I can.  Tomorrow I plan on going to The Bean and ordering a Little Bitch Latte.  Another sign that I could be a 15 year old boy?  'Tangential' makes me laugh every time I hear it because switch the  i  in it and think tan genital .  Heeheehee!

       I did it!  I rocked the party that rocked the bod-ay.  And was crowned Queen of the Robot.  I be breakin' mad crazy, yo.  The best part is that I have no idea what it was that I did.  I think the alcohol had taken over my system at that point because I have thought about it for a while and I get to the point where I know I was standing around when people started dancing and then nothing until I was in the kitchen later on where the QoR title was bestowed.  I'm awesome, and I have no idea why.    Here's the thing... I don't know what it is that I'm doing when I dance. Ever.  There have been two occasions that I can think of where I'm out on the dance floor, doing what I do and then look up to see that a circle has formed around me and people are clapping and cheering.  Its like I've channeled Usher and can bust it like nobody's business (sidenote:  Usher?  Call me.  Thanks.).  One of these times it ended when some guy wanted to battle me.  What? Battle me?  If I have to think about what I'm doing, or am conscious of people paying me attention, it's over. And then I get embarrassed and run away.  Its really entertaining-- you should come watch some time.   Just don't let me see you.

       The word of the week is....   TWIG   My friend Merriam-Webster says: twig (v.) Inflected Form(s): twigged; twig·ging Etymology: perhaps from Irish & Scottish Gaelic tuig- understand transitive senses 1 : NOTICE, OBSERVE 2 : to understand the meaning of : COMPREHEND  I like words, ya twig?  And I'm going to try to put up a word here every week so that we can all grow and learn and come together as people who use words.  This should last approximately 3 weeks because I'm really good on the follow-through.

       First off. Hi.  Secondly?  I know it should be Fresh LY  Baked.  I do.  But I don't wanna!  And if this is going to be a problem for anyone, I would suggest either adapt or abort, because you just wait till the day I don't spell check and then you'll be in for the true horror.  And third.  I'm going to share something I wish I wouldn't, but can't seem to stop myself.    I like Hanson.  I know.  I know, I know, I know-- MMMBop!  But c'mon, give those kids a break-- they're grown up now, kinda, and are past the screechy Peter Brady phase.  They're Greg now!  They're Johnny Bravo!!  Give them a chance.

       Imagine it: You're on your way home from work (birds chirping), almost out of traffic (soft breeze), thinking about the  urlLink burger  you'll soon be enjoying (gentle harp plucking).  Ah... Bliss!  When, all of a sudden, you see a dark cloud up ahead!  (thunk!) But... It's on the freeway with you! (crash!) And it's fast approaching your car! (Zip!)  Hey, hang on now, that's no cloud-- that's, that's, that's...   A SWARM OF BEES  !!!  (Boom, Clang, Pop, Bang!!)  AAaaaahhhh!!  I drove through a swarm of bees.   Thrice , actually, because I guess bees suck at navigation.    I'd like to think I'm with the majority of the population who have joined the 'I Don't Really Care for Bees' school of thought, but for me,  Don't Really Care for  should be replaced with  Am Petrified of and May Wet Myself When Confronted By .  So it's safe to say that I was less than thrilled for them to present themselves as a united front.  Freaked out?  Yeah, freaked out would about sum it up.  And of course, I'm still  driving  at this point, with the sunroof and windows wide-ass open.  I don't know how I didn't get into an accident.  I don't know how I was able to close all the openings to my car so quickly.  I  do  know that I got out my camera, because, Freeway?  Traffic?  Bees?  Why, it's the perfect time and place for taking pictures!    Don't see them all clearly?    urlLink     I've gone ahead and circled every single one of those buggers.   urlLink     No bees were harmed in the taking of these pictures.  Except Benny, there-- Benny met with a rather timely death, in my opinion.

       Movies:   urlLink Dodgeball.    Hilarious!   I was all set to go to the gym last night when a friend called and I wound up at this movie instead.  Ab work-out: covered.  I laughed so much in that movie that I didn't need the gym.  And when did Jason Bateman and I start dating and why did I not know about it?  TV:   urlLink Joe Schmo 2  worked out the rest of my body as I flailed about in a pool of disbelief and humor.  The  boxes and sacks !!  The   Porked 'n Beans  !!  Ingrid's not buying any of it anymore-- she's so gone next week.  Reading:   urlLink I Love Everybody (And Other Atrocious Lies): True Tales of a Loudmouth Girl.   Laurie Notaro wrote about blowing a snot bubble out her nose that is  almost  the size of Christina Ricci's head... HA!  Girl's forehead alone is GIGANTIC and its about time somebody made note of it.  Life:  Yesterday I was stopped at a red light when I looked over at the car next to mine.  A brand-spankin'-new  urlLink BMW Z5 , driven by a young model-woman who was perfectly made up, wearing designer shades, and a fatty diamond ring.  The best part?  In her hand was a  stack  of twenty dollar bills.  Y'know, in case I  didn't  get it before.  Also: (My friend is psychic, too!)   urlLink Dionne  and I were in Dodgeball when, I kid you not, she makes a comment to me that is repeated on-screen, word-for-word, by one of the characters Five. Seconds. Later.

       So the experience I had last week with Hudson was just one in a recent string of events that I seem to have prophesied.  Another example?  Last week I was watching Jeopardy! and answered an question (questioned an answer?) saying  Barbara Boxer  even though I knew it was nowhere near being close.  Not three minutes later the phone rang.  It was Barbara Boxer, calling to say she was  PISSED!   Okay, fine.  It was an automated Barbara Boxer, probably calling to ask me to vote for something-or-other... I don't know.  I hung up after hearing her name 'cause it freaked me out.  But things like this have been happening a lot lately and I have had it up to HERE with the coincidence (and because one of these times, somebody really is going to wind up in the ER).  And speaking of..  I'm very happy Maura Tierney won CPS (but I totally predicted she would).  Not only because I was going to be named Maura, which would have made me happier than the name I wound up with,  but because I loved her on News Radio.  Excellent reasons for wanting someone to win, no?  At least I wasn't basing it on something as superficial as charities.  Très boring!  But, on the downside, I will miss, very much, James Blake's sexy, sexy thumb.  Damn sexy.  Great cuticle.

       This is a piece of the AIM convo that Hudson and I had yesterday when I decided it was time that she be introduced to The Bean.  Not to get too far off topic, but the girl has never been to the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf  in her life .  How does she live??   B: Would you die if we got into my car and I was listening to Clay Aiken? H: Would I die? No, I don't think so. Will I laugh? Oh yeah... B: What if I was listening to Clay Aiken and started singing along so loudly that the windows popped out and then the glass shards flew into my face and I couldn't see so I jumped the center divider and rolled us down an embankment?  Would you die then? H: I already did all of that in my car, except for the windows popping out bit, so I think we'd be ok. Maybe if we actually flipped...   B: Damnit...WHY WON'T YOU DIE?!!  So, we go to the Bean and we get an eXtreme Caramba! and are enjoying it, as it is eXtremely enjoyable, when we get back into the car and I come  thisclose  to killing her  for realsies .    I guess I said something funny (and I wish I could remember what it was because I love it when I'm funny) that made her laugh so hard I thought she was choking and that surely she'd die and I would have killed her and Shit! that IM screen was still up on my computer and it will be used against me no matter how often I say it was a joke!  Then I almost killed her   a second time   immediately after that because my brain said the only  logical  thing to do when you're driving a car and the person next to you is choking is to slam your foot so hard on the brakes that the seatbelt gives her the Heimlich.  Where in the  hell  did I come up with that?  Why  am I trying to kill Hudson?  And  what  does Clay Aiken have to do with any of this?

        No, really:  - Thanks to Zoot (Suit Riot.   Riot!!   If you see her, I recommend throwing back a bottle of beer.) for the Gmail invite.  It's Ggreat and I Glove it.  (Heh.)  - I miss my sister.  She's been gone for most of this year already and now she'll be in Canada for the summer.  It's been 19 days so far-- only 3 more months to go!!   TV Commentary:  Poker:   Lauren Graham is a hustlah!  Man, she was slick.  I'm looking forward to the final now because I think there will be some good bantering with her and MIB. Joe Schmo: Sorry 'bout your luck there, Ernie, but at some point all our wicks go cold.  I didn't think this this elimination was  as  funny as the pearl necklace one, but still, highly amusing.  Also? I can't believe Ingrid, Captain Suspicious, is  not calling this stuff out more.  Ambrosia did a good job getting her to chill out a little, but still... they're taking this to the ridiculous! MXC: If you're not watching MXC, what the hell are you waiting for? Jeopary!: Ken is  awesome .  I cannot believe the amount of knowledge that guy has stored in his brain.   Of note:  - Michael Flatley is on the Forbes.com’s Celebrity 100 as number 75... under  Magician .  This must be because of his magical use of baby oil and not his prestidigitation.

       I would like to thank the following for my expedient arrival to work this morning:  - My three (  three!  ) alarm clocks for going off this morning at their appointed time and still not managing to wake me.  Your asses are fired.  - Whoever messed with the Ranch dressing lid to cause it to gush out All. Over. Everything I was packing for lunch.  - Chuck Taylor.  Chuck, I love ya-- you've kept my feet happy in countless situations but this morning, you were not my friend.  I ran out of the house, socks and shoes in hand, knowing that by the time I hit the freeway my feet would be shod and I'd be ready to roll.  But no.  The tongue of my left shoe would not, for any amount of prodding, lay in a flat, comfortable, shoe-lace-tying position.  - The slow ass motherfucker in the Camry in front of me who REFUSED to get closer than 17 yards to the car in front of him and then for speeding up when I tried to pass him.    - Caltrans, for their super-nifty work on the 405/Harbor on-ramp which now has become a merging HELL for those of us trying to get to the 73.  - And lastly, I would like to give sincere thanks to my next door neighbor, aka: the reason I didn't fall asleep last night.  She was in her backyard urging their dog to go PeePee!  go PeePee!!  go PeePee!  go PeePee!! for what felt like hours.  And to her husband, for arguing with her about the bathroom behavior of this dog loud enough for me to hear  every  goddamn word.  Thank you all, I hope we can repeat this experience never.

       I think I figured out the abounding carb-licious offerings:  they're not for the Atkins-minded, they're for the people who are trying to eat with them.  I went out the other night with a friend who is on Atkins and we had a bitch of a time coming up with something that we could split.  We wound up getting something we both wanted, but it was a struggle to get to that point.  Had there been some of the Atkin's stamped food nearby, I would have graciously given in to getting it for sanity/simplicities sake.  Also, isn't this weird?  Everyday this week a member of my family had his/her hair cut.  It was this crazy phenomena that nobody seemed to notice until this weekend.

       Fascinating opening line:  I went to pick up my dry cleaning this evening after work. More info?  I had to turn the dress in because I wore it while drunk and demonstrating all sorts of stupid drunken behavior.  It's a ticketable offense, made more unforgivable given the occasion and the fact that the dress in question is not mine.  So, I dropped the dress off under a great, shameful cloud.  After all the pertinent information was exchanged, we had this lovely little conversation:   "Can you make sure to get these spots here?" "It would help if I knew what it was." "Um... yeah... thats, um, puke." (God.  I felt like such a louse.)   Cut to today, 2 weeks later:  I gave the lady my name, trying to keep my head low and pretending that I wasn't there for this reason.  (I know this isn't a blue dress scandal, but still, it's something I'm not proud of.)  She came back with my dress and while ringing me up mentioned little things she had noticed, all the while looking at me like I was one step away from rehab.  The stains were stubborn, but she was able to get them out.  Super, she remembers me.  And beads on the collar?  She replaced the one that I had somehow  ripped out  over the course of the evening.  Great!  Thanks!  I had no idea that had even happened.  Oh, and also?  There was a tear above the slit on the side that she was able to repair.  I am OVERJOYED to hear this!   Please , tell me more!  Adding another layer of fun to this is the fact that I was on the phone when I went in there, something I generally consider rude but I feel like I have 'let me call you back in a sec'-d this friend too many times to hang up. (It's different if someone calls you while you're in there, though.  Similar to the differences between 1st degree and premeditated murder.)  I had to give the lady my name while trying not to focus too much on the fact that the speaker on my phone was up much too high and my friend was talking about bikini waxing.   Let me add Dry Cleaner to the list of places to which I am now  thrilled  to get back.

       Joe Schmoe 2 is shaping up to be even more fantastic than the first one, unbelievable as that sounds.  I think all the production members involved have decided to go  so far  over the top with it that the altitude has made them light-headed and, as a result, we get things like the 'falcon twist' (which I keep calling Falcon Crest) and Derek Newcastle, "The Pompous British Host" (Ralph Garman in disguise).  This show is so great.  Best of all had to be the elimination ceremony, in which the 'bachelor' asks the girls he chooses to keep if he "may give [them] a pearl necklace."  I was DYING.  Dead, dead, dying, dead.  I don't know how they all did it with such straight faces.  I was pretty impressed with the group of actors at that point, but even more so with Cammy later, when Ingrid was telling the other girls that their speeches sounded rehearsed and Cammy said "thank you."  Such an idiot-- well done!  Hope they can keep it up.

       I would like to take a moment now to call "Bullshit" on the following:  -Aretha Franklin, the "Queen of Soul," lip syncing (a bad rendition of) the National Anthem at the Piston/Lakers game the other night.  BULLSHIT, Aretha!  And, if the lip syncing wasn't her choice, she should have, at the very least, hit the timing a little better.  -Coke, Ben & Jerry's, and everyone else who have given in to the Carb-tastic way of living.  BULL. SHIT.  Kids, you're eating ice cream and drinking coke-- if you want less carbs, give it up entirely or, alternately, don't eat/drink it all.  Say it with me now:  moderation.  And Slim-Fast!!  Diet Diet Slim Fast.  I upgrade this to HORSESHIT.  -Myself.  Self, you had quite a rant going, which caused this list to be born.  I say Bullshit to you, self.  BULLSHIT for not remembering all the things you were worked up about.  Damnit.

       My weekend started off with a late and hectic exit from work on Friday night, but that madness didn't bother me for too long because  I was going to a baseball game !  I don't know why, but there is something about going into a stadium and watching baseball that makes me happy.  In general, I don't follow baseball (okay, or most sports)-- don't have a favorite team (although I've been taught to hate the Yankees), don't keep track of the scores, wouldn't ever think sit down at home and watch a game, but man... I love going to see the teams play (overpriced beer and all).  Also, the Angels have set up a sweet deal with Ticketmaster where season-ticket holders can sell back the seats they aren't going to be using to make them available to the public.  I think that its awesome for all parties, and, since I purchased my tickets that way, I say a hearty thank you to the folks that gave me V512, row D, seats 5-8.    Saturday dawned with the promise of a new cell phone, and hopefully, one that worked.  My now-old phone was experiencing technical difficulties with about every call I had-- the battery died, I lost a signal, a combination of both, and once when I answered, there was a loud screeching that only stopped when I pulled off the battery pack.  Not fun at all.  To keep this short because I'm sure you're just riveted, I got a new phone.  I have service at home now!  I can text message (which will be my downfall)!  My battery stays charged!  I am in love with this phone.  We're going to run off into the sunset and set up bars called  Energy .  And finally, yesterday.  Yesterday I came to the conclusion that I could, with little difficulty, get used to wearing a tiara.  Back up:  I'm having this party next month where all my guests have been asked to wear something made of duct tape.  Strange?  No--  perfect .  I have started myself out by making a duct tape tiara and, for the record, it is  RAD .  I wore it all night (as you do) and again this morning when I was getting ready for work.  I love it a little less than my new phone, but a lot, nonetheless.

       I just signed up for Netflixs and went absolutely  crazy  adding all these movies to my list.  I ended with 88 titles in the queue and, signing out, read this:  "Most customers add 6-10 movies to their Rental Queue during their first visit."  Its like I just had myself 8-9 visits all at once!  Phew, that sure saved a lot of time.   Also, on the subject of... reading things-- Social Security sent me a letter the other day and my favorite line read, "Your spouse and children will be eligible for a one-time only death bonus of...:  Huh...  one-time only ?  And here I was planning on kickin' the bucket at least twice.    Read the fine print, y'all.  For one thing, its important, but it can also be amusing.

       Things I think of at 5:30am (no sleep till Brooklyn):  -Harry Potter/Azkaban is great.  I saw it tonight on IMAX and can't quite wrap my head around the appropriate words for the experience.  Huge round of applause for all involved (especially the main actors who I like more as they grow up)   -Had I not gone to see HP, I would have been in bed four hours ago... warm, sweet bed...  -I think, if necessary, I would be able to put two whole Twinkies (tm) in my mouth at one time.  I think one would be easy enough (I've never tried), but two might be a bit more of a challenge.  But a challenge I'm willing to face. (and this, on the heels of Holz's decree)  -What the hell am I doing here?  This isn't my bed-- I want my pillow!

       Mary Anne with fellow redhead Maureen O'Hara  urlLink      For the past few weeks/months/whatever, I have been paying special attention to the word 'just'.  I remember in college one of my professors having a big problem with it, as she didn't think we were using it properly since she only accepted it as being an adjective and not an adverb.  Since I've started writing more I've constantly heard her voice in my head crying, "Just doesn't  mean  that-- look it up!!"  And when I did,  just  meant  fair .    On that note, I have also been thinking about how much I hate it when people say that something "isn't fair."  Fair enough, I have used this phrase more than I care to recall, but, as I was 12 at the time and highly pubescent, I will mostly forgive myself.  The type of "isn't fair" that I seem to take special offense to lately is of the petulant, whiney variety that comes when talking about why the well-to-do are living in mansions or why somebody else always gets the freshest melons at the grocery store.  Its ridiculous and small-minded and, on top of that, aren't there a million words in the English language?  It shouldn't be that difficult to pick another more apt.  Well, last week I found myself an offender of my own two gripes.  See, my  urlLink cousin  died on Monday.  You don't know it, but in my post index there is a draft of one, written only hours before she died, asking you all to keep her in your thoughts and, if you're inclined, your prayers.  Since she had cancer and since it was aggressively attacking her, her death was not a surprise-- only the quickness of how it took her.  For the days following, I told myself that while all things happen for a reason, I didn't have to like it.  I realized that she was in a better place and that she wasn't in pain anymore and, as she said in her final words, she was "at peace."  In situations like this, I find that there are a lot of questions asked-- primarily, why?  Why would God choose her to take from us when she was so young?  Why her?  Why now?  Why at all?  I kept thinking about her kids and her husband and all the friends and family she left behind.  But it wasn't until they loaded her casket into the hearse after the funeral that I said to myself "this just isn't fair."

So frightened, in fact, that while I was in the Junior Lifeguard program (a program I pleaded to be excused from) I had a panic attack while doing one of the required swims and had to be hauled out of the water and into first aid.  And yet?  I watched 3 Jaws movies this weekend.  Okay, so I watched the first one twice, but that's a technicality... why am I doing this to myself?  I can't even watch it normally-- I have to tuck my feet under me to make sure they won't be bitten off at the ankle.  The blue carpet isn't helping, either.  -My dad makes my lunch on an almost-daily basis.  It started out when he was making a salad for himself and then for himself and my mom, and now I'm in on the greens.  These salads are works of art-- they are beautiful collections of lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, peppers, almonds, tomatoes, carrots, red cabbage, walnuts, dried cranberries, and flax seed (to help maintain a lovely coat).  The lineup may change from time to time and some stuff is added or taken away, but this fact remains:  its a lot of stuff to be chopping up at 5am for, not only himself, but 2-3 others as well.  You guys remember Job?  Meet his progeny.  Okay, so its not that extreme.  Anyway, the point that I am so slowly getting to is that I was really looking forward to my salad this afternoon and the heartache that I'm suffering is that I will NOT be able to enjoy it.  I'm still confused as to what happened here, but all I know is that one minute it was sitting there, beckoning to me, the Ranch dressing wafting up into my nostrils and sweetly calling my name and in the next minute, the fucker took a fall.  And it fell  good .  It fell EVERYWHERE.  It fell everywhere but in my mouth, which is where it needs to be right now because I'm hungry and I really wanted it and 1, 2, 3... lets have a pity party for me because I'm such a grump!    -My sister (seen below and, there, called Molly) had her birthday under stressful circumstances this year.  Not only had she returned from her travels the day before, but she had only so much time to settle down and be home, unpack, and then repack for the next 4 months before she left to run a B&B (which she has never seen) in Canada (where she has never been).  Add to this a funeral and the accompanying sadness.  It was not a very happy birthday for her.  With all this going on, we decided that she was channeling Sam Baker in Sixteen Candles with all the forgetting of her day because of a larger event.  I feel badly for her, of course.  I'm the sympathetic friend... or the Joan Cusack character, because c'mon, its Joan Cusack and she's rad.  That said, if anyone out there has seen Jake Ryan, please have him contact me immediately-- he has a cake to bake and some undies to find.

        First step: Join a volleyball team, even though you haven't ever really played and haven't participated in team sports since college.      Second step: Make sure you get so involved in the game that you totally disregard your own personal well-being.  Dive, dive, dive.      urlLink      Third step: Invest in kneepads, jackass.      Fourth step: Be sure you scratch yourself at some point so you can  bleed  during practice. This is a good way to intimidate the other team. No, it doesn't make you look like you should be wearing a helmet.      Fifth step: Wake up the next morning not feeling your legs.  They're still there, but you're so sore, your body has shut down all feeling below the waist.  Expend enormous amounts of energy convincing the feeling to come back.     Sixth step: Come up with a catchy team name like "Team Congeniality" since that will be the pity award you will receive. Make t-shirts celebrating this.      Seventh step: Get eliminated in the first game (although it has yet to happen).

        This past weekend, I made myself a LONG list, complete with sub-lists and sub-sub-lists, of things to do. For I am very busy and important. I even woke up early on Sunday to get a head start on these, too. My brain, however, was less than functioning and I was very easily distracted by anything shiny or pretty or soft. And even some things that weren't.     Get up.  Grab my wallet and go to the bank.   Huh... my ATM card isn't in this wallet.  Right.  Well then...   OOhhh!! Starbucks!!  Have huge mental block when it comes to what I say order-- Venti? Large?  Damnit,  urlLink Chris .    Lets try this again.     Get up. Grab my wallet and go to Starbucks.     Go home and motivate.  Lots of stuff to do.   Get a call from Mom... she needs keys.  Grab keys and then wallet, for second attempt at the bank, head out to meet her.   On the way there, realize its the wrong wallet.  Again.   Target!  Target will fix my head.  Target fixes everything.   Forget every damn thing on my Target list the second I walk in the door, except for mouthwash.   Leave Target unsatisfied.  A rare and sad experience.   Drive by the bank, cursing.   Go home, and try to motivate.  Still have not done any of the things needed.   Go shopping with Mom. Borrow money from her since I still haven't been to the bank and Starbucks and Target took all I had left.   Go home and motivate.    5 hours later, start everything I had to do that day.  Go to bed late, late, late and wake up crabby the next day.    As of today, two days later?  I still haven't gone to the bank and the list remains unfinished.

        BULLSHIT GODDAMN MOTHERFUCKIN' PIECE OF HORSECOCK   So.    Okay, so...  Okay, so... there is this door that has been locked for the past 3 years in the office stairwell that leads to the roof of the building.  And for all that time, I have been  begging  someone to unlock it so I can go up and sit in the sunshine and eat my lunch with beautiful scenery.  And finally,  FINALLY , it happened.  On Monday, my manager told me that the door to this magical wonderland had been unlocked.  And my co-workers and I went and basked in the scenery and freedom from our desks.  I ate lunch up there.  I took breaks.  I had mad passionate sex with the lab assistant from the third floor.  (Okay, not really-- but I would have.  But not with him.  Eww.)  Today dawned with promises of more rooftop gallivanting.  At the very moment I put my head down on my keyboard, feeling so finished with today and the 7 years of records I have gone through, my co-worker said, "Lets go up.  I can't take anymore."  God bless her.  On our way out, we grabbed the others.  Together we walked up and soaked in the direct sunlight we were hidden from before.  We walked across the spans of the roof to look at the construction going on next door.  We laughed at all the other poor saps who didn't get to go on their roofs, because they are sad people who have no idea what they're missing and should be pitied.  Poor, sad them.  Well change that to poor, sad us.  The fucking goddamn piece of shit co-worker I have decided that all this joy shouldn't be allowed.  She thought what with all the fun we're having we wouldn't ever go back into the office.  She was crazy with the jealous of me and that lab assistant.  (Nope... still eww.) Because when we came down she pulled the stopper from the lock.  She  PULLED  the  STOPPER  from the   GODDAMN LOCK  .  Wwwhhhhhyyyyyyyyyy??  What is her problem?  Does she hate me?  Does she hate fun?  Does she kick children and dogs, too?   I am at a loss for understanding why she did this.  But I am very certain that I didn't need another reason to hate her and now I am just beside myself with ire. My stomach  hurts  with the control I have had to display over my fists and mouth.  It is a very good thing that the door is locked, actually, because otherwise she would find herself thrown over the side in short order.  PISS.SHIT.DICK.  PS: This is the same co-worker who told me that she liked Elvis's music, but couldn't ever watch him.  Because of the hips and the gyration.  Oh, Lord.  I think maybe she does hate fun.

       There are ways that some people say Congratulations! that are very nice and appropriate for the congratulatory occasion.  Then there are times when the situation leaves you searching for the words that will never come.  Because there are none.  Like when your friend tells you that she got engaged the night before to a kick-ass guy and you are just so happy all you do is scream ( YYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!  doesn't count as a word) and kinda jump up and down even though you're sitting at a desk since she was sneaky and made you look up the word 'affianced' because she had to tell you in some sly way.  There are no words for that.    I am excited speechless.

       Blah, blah, blah duct tape party... and there will be PRIZES!!  Not just any prizes, either-- goddamn handmade-with-love prizes that are slowly stripping me of skin tissue and patience.  Oliver and I started this project yesterday, intending to make a trophy for the best dressed duct taped participant.     urlLink     So we started with a plaster mold...   urlLink    ...that soon after became a plaster mold trapping my hand in 10 gajillion degrees of fire.  Here's a fun fact, kids-- plaster has a  urlLink chemical reaction  to water!   urlLink    140 degrees of heat makes your hand look real pretty...   urlLink     ...and I my hand fell into a burning ring of fire.  And its burn, burn, burn...   And after that?  The mold  broke .  Tonight we went for round two:  papier-mâché (thanks, Jack).    urlLink    Oliver got to be the hand model for this experiment.  Here's the first round of application...   urlLink     ...and a fancy shot of the mold under the halogen.   urlLink     And when that was finished, we tried to fill it with a spray-foam-mold-stuff...   urlLink    ...that   exploded  ...   urlLink    ...and has since refused to come off of anything it came into contact with.  Namely?  Me.  I cannot feel my fingertips.  I have been trying to pull, wash, scrub, and scrape this shit off for a few hours now and predict that I'll have hours and hours more fun doing the same and still getting nowhere.  But the prizes will kick ass.   (ETA:  The foam spray hardened over night.  I feel like I am wearing a sandpaper glove.)

       Of all the conversations I had with the owners before they left, I think this was my favorite:   Them:   "You can take her for a walk in the mornings if you'd like, but keep her away from other dogs."  Me:   "Oh, does she not like them?"  Them:   "She will  eat  them."  (Go ahead and guess how many times she got walked.  Those who say anything other than ZERO are delirious.)   urlLink     As you can see, she's not a small dog, so I'd have to be mighty strong to hold her back from eating another dog.  And while she doesn't look super friendly, she really is... a little  too  friendly on Saturday night, though, when she climbed on top me and started humping my leg.  Pay attention to the nails on her right paw-- those were the ones that dug the fuck into my thigh, so don't be surprised to see bits of flesh hanging around.  Damn that hurt.    And to the jackhole who called at 6:30 on Sunday morning?  I  will  find you.  And I will hurt you.  A lot.  But overall?  The dog-sitting weren't too bad, actually.

       The last time I dog-sat was fairly uneventful.  The time before that?  Makes me surprised I ever dog-sat again.  It was less 'dog-sitting' and more dog- you-have-got-to-be-shitting-me .    The setup: 1 week; 2 people, my sister A and I; 3 dogs, a lab (Boo, 2 years-- tons and tons of energy);  a whippet (Annie, 3 years-- very beautiful and fun) and a daschund (Ziggy-- geriatric, mean-spirited, with nasty halitosis as a result of the teeth that were running away from him because this dog was such an ass).  To expound on Ziggy:  This dog was on his last legs.  He had always slept in the bed with the owners and when they realized that his last legs were also riddled with arthritis?  They made a  ramp  up to the bed for him.  A ramp he had to take a arthritic-running start to get up.  And one from which he could not get down unaided.  No, Ziggy had to be helped down by lifting him off the bed and to the floor, only... Ziggy  hated  being touched.  Especially by me.    Already, you can see that this was a task for no mere mortal.    The sting: On our first night, we played with the dogs, checked out which dirty adult channels they were getting, and ate all the food in the house.  Standard procedure.  We got Annie and Boo out of the house as instructed and then prodded Ziggy into the bed with us.  (Sidenote:  I have never understood why dogs sleep in bed with the owners.  Warmth?  Security?  Grab a blanket and keep the dog on the floor.)  Ziggy was a little enamored with A and wanted to cuddle with her... under the covers but on the pillow and if he could have just a little paw hanging out (or on my face)?  That'd be super.  When we go up there  little  traces of icky all over the comforter.  We had no idea what it was or if it had been there the night before.  So?  We washed the sheets and comforter and promised to look for it again the next day.  Which we did.  And it happened again.  Icky little brown traces of stink.  All over the comforter.  At that point, we knew it was coming from Ziggy, we just didn't know from which orifice. A took him to the vet and we got a diagnosis...  Ruptured.  Anal.  Gland.    Eeeeewwwww.   Ruptured anal glands!!  And we had been sleeping in that ruptured anal gland seepage for two nights!  And need I remind you of the halitosis?  We were, essentially, sleeping in a stink pile with liquid shit.  And it gets better.  The way to cure one's ass of the rupture is to apply an ointment to the wound twice daily.  Oh, were it that easy.  We wound up having to  chase  Ziggy down the hall, sneak up on him from behind, crouch down, and shove the nose of the tube up his ass.  Then, we had to squeeze enough ointment into the hole and get out before he snapped at us.  He may have been losing his teeth, but he had the mean ones left.   Every day, twice a day, for a week we did this.  And continued to have the dog sleep with us at night.  Quite possibly one of the most disgusting things ever.    So this weekend?  I'm dog-sitting.  Wish me luck.

       This week has been forever long.  Seriously.  FOREVER.  By Wednesday I was finished with it and wanted to throw Thursday and Friday away.  There have been a few highlights, but mostly its been looking at the clock at 2:46 and then looking at it again, 20 minutes later, when its 2:47.  Forever.  But, since this week has been so very long and uneventful, the highlights stand out even more.  Such as...  -Ben & Jerry's has brought back the dairy-heroin (dair-oin) Oatmeal Cookie Crunch.  Its for a limited time only, so go get your fix while the dealer has stock.  - And I finished my CD.  Yup... I just got out of the recording studio and boy is my larynx tired.  No.  For the past year or so, every month I compile all the songs I've been listening to and make a CD.  On months when I don't have enough material to make a full CD, I'll wait and do two months at once, which drives me CRAZY with the waiting and by then, I have too much for one disc and they're never my best efforts.  And while all this is fascinating, why don't I just tell you what's on the CD?  Broken/  urlLink Seether  Vindicated/  urlLink Dashboard Confessional  Cold Hard Bitch/  urlLink Jet  Scotty Doesn't Know/  urlLink Lustra  (from  urlLink Eurotrip ) Mother/  urlLink Danzig  Ch-Check It Out/  urlLink Beastie Boys  My Band/  urlLink D12  Date Rape/  urlLink Sublime  Shit Towne/  urlLink Live  Are You Gonna Be My Girl/ Jet Sell Out/  urlLink Reel Big Fish  Where did you go/  urlLink Mighty Mighty Bosstones  The New Year/  urlLink Death Cab for Cutie  Hallelujah/  urlLink Rufus Wainwright  This Grudge/  urlLink Alanis Morissette  Angel Pumping Gas/  urlLink The Postal Service  Float On/  urlLink Modest Mouse  Take Me Out/  urlLink Franz Ferdinand  Rockin' the Suburbs/  urlLink Ben Folds  Musicology/  urlLink Prince   A lot of these are really random and could probably use some explaination.  But I'm not really in the mood to do that right now.  One thing I will say?  As I was driving into work this morning I realized it was  finally  Friday and Hallelujah came on and it was damn near perfect... which it will be if it happens again on my way home.  Happy Friday!!

       Remember the  urlLink drunk posting  from last week?  Here now you will see that I participated with my very own drunk email... that is now being posted.   urlLink      To bring you up to speed:    urlLink  I wrote  -- And when did Jason Bateman and I start dating and why did I not know about it?    urlLink Amalah   comments: Haaaaaaaaaaa. I know what you mean about Jason Bateman.  I would like to marry him. And yet I Googled him and found out he's married to Paul Anka's daughter. Jason! You can do better! Me!   Fresh Baked  responds: Step away from the Bateman!!  You already have a Jason-- leave this one for the rest of us, huh?  Besides, I tap-tapped him first.  For leaving him alone, I will tell you nice things.   Amalah  concedes: Ok, I will not marry Jason Bateman. But if you marry him? I still might try to make out with him a little bit. And for this I am sorry.  Are you going to take back all the nice things you said now?   Fresh Baked  grudges: Deal.  I suppose I'll have to let him make out with his other wife, too...  stupid Paul Anka for breeding.    See?  All is well here.  A little fake celebrity adultery never hurt anybody and we're playing so nicely.  But then  this  happens...    urlLink       Fresh Baked  snots: Just in case the rest of your fab weekend takes you to Anchorman... Paul Rudd is already taken.  By ME.  That's right, I'm the bitch who takes all the guys.  And ain't no amount of  urlLink Care Bears  gonna heal that wound in your heart.  -b (for bitch)   Amalah  corrects: I hate to tell you this, but I laid claim on Paul Rudd way back in the days of "Clueless." But maybe I will trade you a Paul Rudd Dream Date Spectacular for a weekend getaway with Jason Bateman.  -A (for...um...asshat?)   and  finally , after some of this?     urlLink        Fresh Baked  slurs: Amy, I do believe you're forgetting a little show called "isiters.: Shit.  Sister.s  Whatever.  Kirby had to marry ashlet Judd,  and i had to love him right then.  FOREVER.  but i love the swap more.  lets keep them in constant rotation; their wivbs won't mind. also on sisters-- George clooney.  who wsa in facts of life.  whcih brings us back to  urlLink blaire and trashy sears girls .  see? loopy.

       In my junior year of college, I decided it was time for our apartment to have a pet.  This launched a successive string of hamsters, a pet that is enjoyable though not all that durable.  Before we get started, let me say that all these hamsters, though each had an individual moniker, was only ever referred to as  Hammy .     Moons Over My Hammy .  I had this hamster for all of about a week.  One day I came in from lacrosse practice to find two of my roommates crouched on the kitchen floor with flashlights, a broom, and the refrigerator pulled out of it's nook.  Seems that Hammy1 had made a break for freedom and wound up under the fridge that I'm willing to bet hadn't been moved since its installation in 1973.  A few days later we noticed that Hammy1 was doing a sad little hammy shiver in his cage and hadn't eaten in a while.  When I called for help, the pet store guy suggested that I stick my finger up his ass to see if there was some... I really don't know-- the dude lost me after he suggested I stick  my finger  up my hamster's  ass .  Instead, I took Hammy1 in to the store for a "professional" to do the deed.  Within minutes, the kid came back suggesting I look for another hamster because that one wasn't going to make it.  I don't know what exactly happened to this guy- possibly something he ate under the fridge?  RIP, Hammy1.     Beady-Eyed Hamster .  Hammy2 was named after a girl we went to school with, aka:  the Beady-Eyed Dancer, for reasons I'm sure you can understand. (Seriously?  The beadiest eyes ever!!) Hammy2 wouldn't bite like Hammy1 did, nor try to make a break for it, and was very good with children.  Or, drunk college students who behaved like children.  While he played well in his ball, he didn't have to go in it all the time because he liked to run on the window sill and the back of the couch... which is how we (I) eventually lost him.  I let Hammy2 out to play one day and there he went, quiet as a hammy, playing his heart out on the window sill.  He was so quiet, in fact, that I forgot he was out and went to class without putting him back.  Three guesses as to what happens when you leave a hamster playing by an open door and there are cats lurking nearby.  RIP, Hammy2.    Scary Hamster With No Name .  After the demise of Hammy2, I wanted another hamster right away ('cause I was so good at caring for them).  But I wanted one that was cool and tough.  So I got one with black spots and had a piece of his ear missing.  I wanted to name him  Rebel Without a Hammy , but my roommates put the kibosh on that by making me take him back before he ever got settled in because they didn't think he was cute.  The best part?  I brought him back to the store and told them that  my kids  didn't like it and wanted one that was prettier. So, no RIP to Hammy3, but... sorry you were ugly.    Green Eggs and Ham(ster) .  As though to make up for all the hammy drama from before, Hammy4 was the easiest and most kick-backedest hamster (though nowhere near as cool as Hammy2).  He lasted the longest, too.  Hammy4 made it through the end of junior year and lived all through my senior year next door to a box turtle named Droz.  After graduation, Hammy4 was raffled off in my sister's 5th grade classroom to a student who took very good care of him and informed us of his sad passing not too long ago.  RIP, Hammy4.   So there you have it.   It  being either a list of hamsters I had in college or a very good reason to never let me near your pets.

       -We drank a LOT on last Friday.  But we also took  urlLink Chaser  and it worked reeeeeal nice.  Perhaps there are  urlLink others  who should try it?    - That fine gentleman in the black hat down there?  He took his Chasers, turned to me, and said:  "If I start making out with you, its only because of the pills."  Now isn't that  the  most   romantic thing you ever did hear?

       The best part about this story is the fact that there are photographs to go along with it, so I'll keep the exposition down.  Friday turned out to be a fun, drunken night.  Bar-hopping, stolen shots, and a bacelorette party that we weren't a part of but they left us with wonderful prizes anyway (Note: my prize was the best because Balls! and the creepiest because Veins!):   urlLink     Ah! L'amour!   urlLink     I don't know... write your own caption here.   urlLink     There are few things funnier than putting a straw with a penis-shaped topper on it into a guys drink in a bar when he's not looking.  The confusion on their faces is beautiful because, not only is there something in their drink, its a  penis !  And its happy to see them.  We did extensive research on this subject that night-- this is just the only one I caught on camera.  And in the end, the guy who actually drank out of the straw won a kiss from MEEEEEE!  They were  brawling  for that straw, let me tell you...

       Right.  So.  Okay, so... nobody knows who  urlLink Riki Rachtman  is?   MTV?  Headbanger's Ball?  No?  Right... well, forget I said anything then.  My 4th was good and mellow, thanks for asking.  Pa and I did a 5K in the morning (and saw Riki Rachtman-- still?  nobody? where's the love?) and it was rather uneventful, really.  Except that my shoes decided to hate me about a mile into the race and I have God's Biggest Blisters to prove it.    Ha!  I said 'race' like I was  running  it and I, well... I wasn't.  Also, hey-- You know what makes a 3-day weekend even more fun?  Injury!  But, before I get there:  I'm moving.  MOVING!  About a mile away from where I live now... at home, with parents I love, but don't really want to live with anymore.  So... Moving!  But not before a lot of work gets done to the new house.   Like taking down the wood paneling.   urlLink      And fugly gold-veined mirrors.  urlLink      And an ENTIRE corkboard wall.  urlLink      But mostly, I want the cat stink gone.  (Confession: I used to be one of those people who said that they were allergic to cats when really? I just don't like them (sorry, cat lovers).  Turns out, Karma is a bitch named Dander.)  The previous owners had 2 cats and, I guess, lacked the wherewithal to remove any and all evidence of their existence before I set foot in the place.   Rude!   This makes me all sniffy and watery-eyed which makes using a drill a bit more difficult.  But, as it turned out, not as difficult as wielding a hammer.  And for that story:  Ma and I went over yesterday to rid the place of its paneling.  Here is where I tell you that my mom is Super!  Wonderful!  Amazing!  All of these things are true, plus-- she can take down paneling like nobody you have ever seen.  Believe me when I tell you that she will make all of your moms cry should it come to a take-down face-off.  And you're a bad kid if you want your mom to cry. My job, after the paneling was down, was to remove all the residual nails.  Even the high ones.  Even the ones that are high and really comfortable with their place in the universe and are rather adverse to the idea of leaving it.  Even those.  It was in taking out one such nail when I learned that Karma has a cousin named Gravity.  And Gravity is an even bigger bitch than Dander when it comes to payback.  I had been working at this nail for some time when, finally, it just gave.  And the hammer I had been pushing on flung back in the direction of my head and when the time was right, Gravity yelled   "NNNOOOOOOOWWWWWW!!!!"   and let the hammer fall.  On my head.  In the ouchy Parietal bone that I totally had to look up because if it has a name you'll feel sorry for me.  I saw stars, I  dismounted  from the ladder a little less than gracefully.  I saw more stars.  I felt pain.  And then, well, those nails weren't going to take themselves out, so I got back up and finished the job.    Remember the tug-of-war scene in Revenge of the Nerds when the geeky Tri-Lams just dropped the rope and the hunky Alpha Betas just fell down?  (I bet Riki Rachtman does.)  I mention it because it was just about as graceful as this post.  And to point out that Gravity didn't like the Alpha Betas, either.

       OK so I just returned from one of my camping trips. It was a good time. Ok so I attended the wonderfull Duct Tape Party then I left at midnight to begin the 6 hour drive up to the campground. Now on this trip I went with my pops and my buddy, George. We have been going to the same spot for quite a few years now and usually my Pops does all the driving but this time I volunteered for the first leg. So I stopped drinking early at the party and left it about 10PM then headed home to relax for a little bit and to finish packing. We finally got on the road at 12:22 AM. I was behind the wheel, George was shotgunning/naviguessing and Pops sacked out in back. So I at one point had mentioned that I would drive till I got tired. Everyone should know that i am renowned for my ability to fall asleep in car. I think I was 17 the first time I made it the 15 minute trip to my Grandparents house without falling asleep. Claps for Jack on that one! Ok so back to the story. So I am buzzing along the 405N to the 5N over what everyone calls The Grapevine which is really Ft. Tejon pass. Grapevine being a little pissant town(no offense to the 3 people that live there) I am still feeling pretty good. George and I are joking around being typical OC brats making fun of hickvilles and the like. Good Times. Oh yeah pops is still out cold in the back seat. I get on the 99N and zoom along. We get into Bakersfield which is a real actual city and I bet they even have a starbucks and a dentist there. Anyways this is when pops decided to wake up and start freaking me out. His first words in 2+ hours are "Where the F*(# are we?" I start to panic and I answer "Bakersfield" hoping that is the right answer since its the only one I have. He responds with a "WTF are we doing in Bakersfield?" I go with "Driving on the 99" as my answer. I start trying to convince my sleep addled pops to realize all is kosher and I didnt screw up again. He starts yelling "this isnt Bakersfield its Northridge" (1.5 hours beind us is Northridge) I am like "no its Bakersfield its developed they have stuff here now". So he starts to come out of it and explains his theory. He woke up without his glass and saw a Cal State next exit sign. He assumed we hadnt gone that far and were in Northridge but hes been to Northridge and know that there are no Big Oleanderlike tree/shrubs in center median in Northridge so he was freaking. Anyways George reports that when he started F-bombing me and freaking me out my face went to Oh Shiite! mode and I had the look of deer in headlights meets dem I am with no chappy.(not pretty) So while we were at the campsite "sippin pabst" as I am prone to doing we were randomly shout out "WTF are we doing in Bakersfield?" That my friends is what campin' is all about.  Jack

        Are we the worst  urlLink fugging  guestbloggers in history? I mean, here bmh hooks us up with this stylin' forum, and we don't even have the decency to throw down an entry for two goddamn days?  Look, it's not that we aren't thrilled.  Because we totally are.  And, yeah, we're real busy at work, but you all don't seem to let that rain on the blog parade. It's more that we're  urlLink chickenshit .  I mean, there's a supremely high level of humor in these parts.  It's like, if I don't make people shoot  urlLink champagne  out their noses, the attempt is futile.  So for now, I'm just saying howdy.  I'll save the quest for ha-has for next time.   dem i am  p.s. Did you notice that I linked like I was born to it? YEAH

        urlLink       That's the fam on vacation last year after the six of us decided to hike Half Dome. Oh, Half Dome, you beautiful siren... you lured us in with your promise of a sunny hike and beautiful scenery and family togetherness. You dirty, dirty bitch. The Cliffs notes (oh, I kill me): 17 hours. On a rock. In the woods. In the dark. In pain. (And I am seriously rockin' some unfortunate hair in that picture. I'm going to pretend it was post-nap, post-wind tunnel, post-hallucinogenic. You do the same.)    Tomorrow we're going to Canada to spend a week with Eia who is working on Prince Edward Island for the summer. We're staying in a lighthouse! Take bets now on how often   I'll Be Your Candle On the Water   and other   urlLink Passamaquoddy  -inspired songs will be sung.  (Hint:  Over a Gazillion.)    But, Hark! Who will blog for me in my absence? Fear not, for I have recruited some very awesome non-bloggers to handle this super-sized task.   Jack  ,   Leo  , and   dem i am   have all agreed to put their individually giant minds into a collective effort to regale you with tales both large and small.       We'll work on introductions later.  Its CYA-time right now.

        He Said:  Welcome to the   urlLink Coffee Bean  , what can I get for you?   She Said:  I'd like a large Moroccan Mint Latte and a lemon poppy-seed muffin.  Heated, please.   He said: Sure thing.  Here's your total.  Have a great day!    But what really happened:    He Said:  Welcome to the Coffee Bean, what can I get for you?   She Said:  I'd like a large Moroccan Mint Latte and a lemon poppy-seed muffin.  Heated, please.   He   Heard  :  Moroccan Mint Latte.  Muffin of some description.     (Long pause, staring at the bakery shelf)   He Said:  What kind of muffin?   She Said:  Lemon poppy-seed.  Heated, please.   He   Heard  :  Lemon poppy-seed.  Something done with it.   (Long pause, staring at the muffin in hand)   She Said: Heated... please.   He   Heard  : Put it in the microwave until it is only slightly warmer than room temperature.   He said: Sure thing.  Here's your total.   She:  Held out CB card for payment.   He:  Got the almost-but-not-quite warm muffin out of the microwave.   (Long pause, staring at the muffin in hand)   He Said: Here's your muffin.  Total is the same.     She:  Was still holding out CB card for payment.   (Long pause, staring at the card before swiping it)   He Said:  Have a great day!    And then, a few minutes later:   Barista Said:  Who ordered the Moroccan Mint Latte?   She said:  I did.   Barista Said: We're out of Moroccan Mint.  Can I get something else for you?   She said:  You have   got   to be kidding me.

       It was the summer of '97 and I was just a youngster, getting ready to go off to college and flash my pearly whites, fresh from their trials with braces and those God-awful rubber bands. I was back on gum! Corn on the cob! Soda out of the can and not the straw! And then... the wisdom tooth conversation. They had to go. My teeth were too pretty and expensive to risk the possibility of future jacking. I put up a minor protest, consisting of a lot of stuttering  'but, but, but...'   and in the end, knowing it was a wasted effort, I reconciled myself to the operation.  At the consultation, I was told that only one side of my mouth had any incoming teeth for the operation. One side. Lefty McWisdom. And one of the teeth hadn't actually fallen, so they were going to take a hammer and crack it, then vacuum up the pieces. Uhh...  'scuzi ?  Hammers and vacuums in my  MOUTH ?  What the hell was going on here?  The operation was suupah fast and when I woke up, the first thing I did was ask for my teeth. I slept a lot, watched bad movies, and was instructed to drink a lot of  urlLink ensure  like any good 80-year-old should.  ("For your health, dear.  No, for  our  health." Gah!! I still remember that shit?!) After a day or so I was back up and running and since my cousin was in town I got to go to Disneyland and Hollywood and Sea World... on drugs. Yay!!  It was on the trip to Hollywood that I pulled a seriously boneheaded move. For whatever reason, we had gotten into a conversation on the best ways to flip someone off. You have your standard out-of-the-pocket  "Hey I got something for you"  but I preferred to be a bit more creative-- I wanted the Thinking Man's bird. So I demonstrated 'the balloon.' Here's what you do: make a fist; put the knuckle of your thumb up to your lips; as you make huffy-puffy noises, slowly open your hand until your middle finger is all the way up and you're flipping the person off. Super funny to do, especially when you over-exaggerate the blowing as I did. Which is always a good idea when you have STITCHES HOLDING THE BACK OF YOUR MOUTH TOGETHER. I busted a stitch. Which actually could have been damn funny if it weren't for the screaming pain that had clawed its way through the Vicodin and was then throwing a tantrum  in my face .   Yeah.  I'll take  OOOOOOOWWWWWW, The Paaaaaiiiiiiin  for $1200, Alex.  And the point of me telling you all of this is for me to say that I think I'm cutting a new tooth. If that's even possible. Yesterday, I started feeling some pain in the wisdom-toothal area of my mouth and got a sinking suspicion that it was the beginnings of a new adventure in dentistry--  my favorite!!  Don't you worry, though-- I'll be sure to let you know what develops and how I was able to cause myself more pain by being stupid. You can hardly contain yourselves, I know.

        We didn't suck. Well, we lost in 2 and we lost pretty hard, but we didn't get annihilated. The scores might have been 25-13, 25-16 but I can't really be sure because nobody recorded it. So the first game is over and done with and we have... well, nobody seems to know the schedule. A few more? One more? Its like a well-oiled machine, this volleyball tournament.

       We have our first volleyball game in 45 minutes.  I was sitting here at my desk not worrying (or doing much of anything) and then  urlLink Hudson  had to go and remind me that we're gonna take a stomping soon.  So now I'm sitting here giving my knees a pep talk and she's in the back, trying not to puke like she's Doug Dorsey.   urlLink Toooooee piiiick!!   Also-- we decided yesterday that we weren't so much a 'uniform' team, yet when I came in today, I was told I needed a white shirt.  Which I didn't have with me.  Oliver, to the rescue!  Dude is rad-- he brought me two shirts (in case I didn't like one), my bandana, a towel, the bracelet I dropped on my way out this morning, and half a donut.   Ha!!

       My parents are out of town. This can only lead to one thing for Oliver and me: babysitter syndrome. Ladies and Gentlemen-- Authority has left the building!  Remember when you were a kid and your parents left for a night out and you could just run around doing whatever it was that you wanted to do? Perhaps it was because I am the youngest and my 'babysitters' happened to also be siblings and they, too, were able to get away with spending all that time on the phone or smoking in the backyard, but I don't remember being too closely watched. Want to eat crayons? Go ahead! Homework? Don't do it! Your sister is bothering you? Punch her!  Harder!!  It was like you were allotted 5 hours to try to get away with everything you're not allowed to do otherwise. I have never grown out of that mentality. So now that they're gone for the next 3 weeks, its like we're living in Neverland... without the illegal touching.  Our response to their leaving was immediate-- Oliver dropped them off at the airport and then took off in their car for hours and hours. I sat my ass down  on the couch  and ate ice cream. And while we have trays upon trays of enchiladas that have to be eaten and that were cooked with love (and even a few tears), we just want to go out and eat fast-food and everything else we never get. I stopped at 7-11 on my way home from practice yesterday because I could walk into the house with the bag and not get hassled. We have a  pile  of  urlLink Whatchamacallits  and  urlLink Rolos  on the kitchen counter and two pints of B&Js Oatmeal Cookie Crunch in the freezer.  Because we're 8.  I have yet to vacuum since the party. I took yesterday off to do some post-part cleaning (not that I needed an entire day to get this task done) and vacuuming fell by the wayside when I got the idea for a nap. Oliver and I did have a grown-up moment yesterday, though-- we emptied the dishwasher together while watching The Bourne Identity.  This is impressive only because about ten years ago it would have ended in my wet-towel-snapping death for not drying things fast enough.  And about 5 years ago it wouldn't have been emptied at all.  Of course, this also leads to moments of  Where's Mom Now?  Like when I see Oliver drinking Non-Fat milk instead of his usual 2% because neither of us has gone to the grocery. Or when I couldn't get a stain out of (oops) borrowed clothing. But mostly, I'm enjoying the babysitter feeling.

       I am Exhausted.  Ex-to the-Haus-to the-Ted.  Seriously. And I even took yesterday off because of the much-needed sleep.  To recap, briefly:  - I left work early on Friday to kick-start the weekend of Crazy. And it helped, too. I got a lot of last-minute 'oh, crap! I forgot  chhheeeeeeesssseeeeeeeee !' things done. Then A called and turned into a knight on a stallion, offering to make my cake and roll enchiladas for me. Looooove. HUGE load off my mind and I was able to pick up  urlLink meggy d  from the airport with a few less weights on my shoulders. (and, hello?! she started a blog when she was here-- how cool is she?)  - Saturday: D(T)-day, started about 5 hours too soon. But was, ultimately, I think, a success. The keg went dry a little too soon, but a beer run was made in good time, and there was more food than you can ever imagine. I think I used about 2 1/2 trays of food out of the 7 I made. Leftovers, anyone? And, the duct tape!! OH, the DUCT TAPE!! There is no way I can explain how great everyone was to play nice-nice to the birthday girl by dressing up in non-breathable, super-sticky materials in the middle of a summer's afternoon. They are, without reservation, the GREATEST friends a girl could have.  - Sunday: Again, waaay too early with the 1 o'clock baseball game. And with the  urlLink US Open  in town, downtown HB would have been a mess to get into the  urlLink Sugar Shack  for breakfast. Which is a damn shame, because the Sugar Shack is some good eats. But anyway, the hometown Angels won the game and I personally think its because they love me. Really.  Thanks, guys.  -There is no way this post is complete with out pictures.  Stay tuned, kiddos.  And thanks for all the love.
