      When I was about 18 years old, I had a lot happening in my life.  I moved to Canberra to see if I could have a better life then what I had when growing up in the State of Queensland.  I was without a job when I moved here and life was a real struggle, life got so low that I looked into doing a range of work that most people would not normally ever think about.  I met some interesting people in those days.  Some are still around me; others are still in my thoughts.  At the moment I am reading a book about the life of an Australian sex worker and how she becomes to find herself in this situation in life.  It has been interesting to read how many of the things that happened to her as a young girl, do have some links to her later life.  Here brother had sexual abused her when she was about 10 years old.  Being exposed to this sort of activity reflected many parts of her later life and it was good to see that she could see the connections between these issues.  One interesting point that I read about was some of her clients that she got to know over the years.  Like herself, many clients also had dysfunctional issues that ended up shaping parts of there own life’s.  The simple fact that clients visit sex workers was because the clients believe that sex worker have very open minds when it comes to understanding someone needs, and even to the extent that clients could fulfil sexual fetish’s, it was not always a case that people visited to just to get there rocks off.  As someone who has been involved in the study of people with sexual fetishes, I sort of understand the whole big picture.  Not many people feel safe with the idea of telling a partner about the “non standard sexual interests”.  In the gay world, we call 'standard' sexual interests -  Vanilla sex .  People who are interested in fetishes and other interests are  'non vanilla'  people.  The book is a really good read, however a little erotic at times (not something to give to your mother) but shows how someone’s life could be very different – it comes down to what chooses we have when travelling the road of life.  Have you ever wondered what your own life could have turned out to be like if only you had chosen a different road?  On a lighter note, I remember when I was about 7 years old, my mum used to get me to read the daily newspaper to her while she worked away in the kitchen (building some wonderful meal or cake).  One day I was reading out loud enjoying the process, and as I flicked through the paper to find more interesting things to read out aloud, I came across a page full of escorts.  To me, an escort was a car that drove ahead or a large truck advising people of the large truck ahead.  It was something that we would see every now and again often as we travelled a great deal around the countryside.    It was quite innocent then when I commented on the fact that the newspaper had so many advertisements for escorts.  My mum kindly explained to in detail what the types of escorts are that advertised in the newspaper.

      The other day I was thinking about life, or more to the point - death.  I am happy with my own life, I have a good job, a nice lifestyle, family and friends who are dear to me and I am in good health.    On weekends that I am home, I enjoy the simple pleasure of being able to sit and read the newspapers.  I maybe over do it a little, with 5 different newspapers on Saturday and 3 on Sundays, none the less I do enjoy something from each of them a great deal and as a result I have some trouble about how to cut down on this interest as I feel it is waste of paper which = trees.  Each Saturday I read the birth and deaths notices (sometimes referred to as 'hatches and dispatches') and I wonder how the death of people affects others in the world.  Reading the other day how death is seen as a celebration of someone successful ability to have given something small to this world was interesting.    However I also remember reading the diary of someone who committed suicide not long ago.  This was a horrible process reading how someone was in a self destruct mode and from what I understood; he had little support from friends or family during his time of need.  Here is a little bit about his own thoughts before he took his own life.  He had been thinking about how his death would affect his own children if he took his own life....    Can I contemplate many years of torture just to save someone from their own life of doubts and insecurities ? Which way is most fair and most unfair ?     It should be noted that often people who do commit suicide do have a process they go though, such as making sure that most things are up to date, even down to the fact that the every day bills are paid for and in one case that I was involved with, he even had the newspapers cancelled and the mild delivery put on hold.  As someone who used to suffer terrible bouts of depression, I remember once when I was also suffering from a horrible low self image, being that low that I did think about exiting this world - however deep down I did not have the strength for the process.  These days I do still suffer some depression, however most of this is more to do with the shorter days during winter and it is now proven that a great deal of people DO suffer this problem - often referred to as SAD,  urlLink Seasonal Affective Disorder .  I am a very aware person and I know when I am suffering this problem.  One treatment that works for me (may not work for everyone) is that go to the solarium.  Odd as it sounds - it helps me.  I am not sure if it is the fact that on a cold day, my body is warm though to the heart, or maybe the intense UV rays helps to kick start my brain into thinking it is summer again, or maybe just the simple fact that I lye down and relax for 30 minutes in peace.  The important key - it helps me.

      Since I started to work in the city a few years ago, I get to see and meet some of the most interesting people in this capital city.  I believe that people here have a much higher income them people in any other city in AU.  We don't really have the middle range of class of people much nor do we have many poor people.  The other day I read a report that claimed that our poor people here in Capital city are well off when it comes to being poor.  Hard to understand that you can have well off poor people - would that then not make them poor?  When my dad was here on a 6 week visit he asked me to show him the area that the poor people live in - I could not really thing of any one spot other then Oaks Estate as we have managed to mix our poor people in with the not so poor and as a result we don't have any one suburb that would clearly give you the idea that we had some people who suffer from lack of money.  Anyway, we also have one of the highest numbers of drug users per capita and that can be seen quiet clearly on the streets most days just by walking around the city area.  The drug users, often referred to as 'drugos' can make ever the most secure person feel threatened when you are walking around the city.  Often you will see some person having the most aggressive argument with something like a street post or a tree.  While I worked with ex-drug users for many years, I never admit to understand what each person feels or suffers from with this sort of addiction.  Along with all the people you pass on the streets, I see all sorts of your 'normal' types of folk (whatever normal is).  I sometimes look at them and wonder who they are and what life has been like for them.  Are they happy?  Do they have sex regularly?  Are they loyal to there partner?  What floats there boat?  Of course I do see people who I find attractive.  Often I almost consider them to be heterosexual (straight) as I don’t find myself as attracted to ‘gay’ types of people.  What a viscous cycles I run myself through!  In the gay world, we refer to people that look attractive as ‘eye candy’.  You might never met these people, find out who they are or even what sort of personality they have – however, the look if enough for your to enjoy for a moment and maybe make your heart flutter for a second or two.   One of the secrete joys of life that I think we could all relate to.  The simple joy of being able to look and admire.

      Stars shining bright above you Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you" Birds singing in the sycamore tree Dream a little dream of me  Say "Night-ie night" and kiss me Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me While I'm alone and blue as can be Dream a little dream of me  Stars fading but I linger on, dear Still craving your kiss I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear Just saying this  Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you But in your dreams whatever they be Dream a little dream of me.......

      Today as I walked to work; the air was cold and the sun was not making an appearance due to cloud cover, I started to think of warmer places.  Last August I went on a driving holiday.  The last few years we have been hit with a range of ads in the press telling us of the joys of driving holidays.  I guess it is not really a bad idea considering the issues with air travel these days.  My driving holiday took me up the east coast of AU, stopping at remote seaside towns, spending night sleeping in my tent.  It was the most relaxing and delightful holiday I have ever had in my life.  I had no real plans in mind and sometime I drove further then I would thought I would, other times I would spend an extra night in some delightful spot I had found on my travels.  The aim for the trip was to drive to central Queensland to spend about 10 days with my dad at his place.  He lives in a remote part of this country.  Last week when I talked to him on the telephone, he was telling me of the delightful weather he has been getting up in his part of the world.  No frosts!  No cold weather really!  30 degree days in the middle of winter!    He asking if I would come and visit him again this winter and he talked about places that he would like to take me while I visit.  Places like the Emerald and Longreach, maybe a few days out on the Western Queensland boarder with the Northern Territory.  It did sound like a wonderful adventure as dad had lived out that part of the country for about 10 years and still has contact with many of his friends who remained out that way.  So what I am I doing still here?  I would love to go, however I have a range of issues that keep me here - tied to my work and home life.  I have started to write a list of things I need to fix/adjust/arrange so I can make this brake for the warmer country.  The hard question really is, should I ever come back?

      One of the many nice things about living and working in the city is that I get to walk to and from work.  As I walked home from work late the other night, I noticed a three different people looking in rubbish (trash) bins.  I wondered about how someone in this up and coming town would need to do this.   As I walked past one guy digging down in the bin, I noticed a small pile of books he had collected. I wondered if maybe it is not a matter that this guy is poor and needs to find something to eat or whatever - maybe it is more that we are just so wasteful here in the city of high paying jobs.  I noticed that the books looked like they are all in good condition - why would someone throw them in the trash when they could have dropped them off at a op shop or something like that?  As I walked further on in the cold dark night, I wondered what it would be like to be homeless.  Back when I was 16 years old, I had the opportunity to become a full time drug user.  As most people know, this lifestyle normally kills you or makes you so desperate for money that you will do anything to survive.  Maybe if I had stayed with a life of drugs I might have ended up some bum on the street.  I guess I am lucky that I managed to work my shit-out and make the choose to get out of the crowd of people.  I guess that is what life is all about when you think about it - a choose of which road to travel down - most of us are lucky to have picked the right roads in life travel.

      If you every get the time to read my web page (www.blueeyes.id.au), you will know that I hated school.  If only I knew what I know now.  I was not a normal kid.  I came from a non-English background so English was an up hill battle all the time (you might even notice it when you read what I type).  Math, well hated that too.  I wanted to know more interesting things.  I did not want to sit still and read a book.  Today most good education systems would be able to work with this ad give a kid like me a great education.  Back when I was small, I was only seen to be a troublemaker.  Over the last two years I have been thinking about the people I went to school with.  What happened to them all?  Surly some of them must have turned out to be normal, even slightly interesting.  I have looked on the net a few times, never really sure how to find anyone.  I did find one kid that I used to have crush on when I was about 12 years old.  Ahh, he turned out so straight - it was hard to believe.  He is not just a fat ass bum who has some lame job and a couple of snot nosed kids.  What a waste.  He was one of these kids that I was sure would be someone great.  Everyone at school thought he was the cool guy.    Today I would a website (thanks to one of my staff) which has peoples profiles and the schools they went too.  Ahh, what a blast it was to discover.  Although I battle the on going issue with my poor memory, it was still nice to read how some people have turned out to survivors.  Some were lucky and had kids, others were happy to stay in the same town they grew up in.  I look forward to getting to know some of them again.  I hope most of them treat me better then they did when I was at school!

      Last night I had to go to a committee meeting for a small dog rescue group that I am a coordinator for.  It is interesting as I am the only male on the committee and as such I often feel that I have the last say in most of the issues that need to be dealt with.  Dont get me wrong, I am not pushy male who feels he has to have the last say, it is more that the females in the group need someone to bite the bullet at the end of an active debate for each issue.  As a male with no real strong females within my life, I never really have any 'male power' to prove or test.  Last night I was thinking of how I was such a little gentleman when I was a kid.  I had some good females role models when I was a kid.  My mum would have been number one, with my Aunty Margaret also being of good influence over the years.   Seeing other kids these days (now I sound like I am really old), most kids are rude and have poor manors in my eyes.  It makes me wonder how they will treat females later in life.

      Some years ago I started a little personal web page.  I find that I am the type of person who gains a great deal from writing things down - be it feeling, emotions or what ever.    The web page has been a great way for me to talk about myself.  I have an on going issue with my failing memory and the web page helps me to build my life history slowly as parts of it comes back to me.  At the moment I have a real family focus.  I want to know all about my family history.  Unfortunately, we dont have any real records.  My brother has a basic family tree which I want to get a copy of and I think could be a important learning tool for my own interest.  Almost all my living family are back in Germany.  Although I do think that Australia is my home - I often have such a strong want to return to Germany and see if I could possible live there.  Having holidays there had always been great, but I wonder if living there would be just a nice.  I have been searching the internet for a while now trying to find if I have any family who have taken to the net.  I have not had any success.  However I think has also made me curious about my family history as I often come across other with the same family name as my mum and dad and I start to wonder if I might have a much bigger family that I had alway known.  Have you ever found yourself writing letters that you never intend to post?

      I have been thinking about do this for some time now, however I did wonder about a few issues with this process.  Who wants to read about my thoughts?  Do I make this funny, emotionally deep or some way of posting my political views public.    I am going to start by looking deeper into my own emotional feelings and see what grows from this point.  Following will be my thoughts for today.  Hello big world of blogging!

      The other day I was sorting out some of my paper work that had slowly built up in my case that I take to work each day.  I was looking at some of the papers that I had put together of places that I had been and plan to visit in the next few months.  I remember when I was a poor-er person and money was very tight.  A trip to the coast would take some time and effort of organise before it could all happen.  I had to make sure the car I had was going to make the trip without any problems, I had to cost in the price of fuel and other bits that would all dig into my already often empty wallet.  Now days, life is much better when it comes to me and my finances.    Just in the last 4 months I have been all over the place, including in the last few weeks, a week in Ballarat (799kms from home), Nabiac (550kms from home) Cowra (250kms from home) and other trips about the place.  Looking forward I hope to do a  few more trips to Cowra each few months, plus I am intending to go to Brisbane in mid October this year as it will be 20 years ago that she died and I wanted to make a visit to her grave (1400kms from home) for a few days away from life at home.  As I wondered the other day if my life has become too complicated - the simple act of getting away from home life for a few days has turned out to be an enjoyable act.  I look forward to travel a more over the years, after all, why should I wait until I retire before I see this wonderful country?

      In the last few months, I have had some real highs and lows.  Thinking of a bigger picture, one of the good things to happen in my life is that a dear friend has moved back to be close to me.  JJ had come just in time as my life has been on a up and down rollercoaster which at times looked like it was about to come off it rails and end up in a mess.  My relationship which has never been perfect (in my eyes) had slowly turned out to be nothing more then a co dependent friendship.  However, this partner has done the same thing to me as my other former partner.  Lies and cheating always catch up with people.  The silly thing is that people really do believe that they will never be found out, but anyone with any brains and experience will tell you that you can never hide the truth.  I was lucky to spend a day with a wonderful person who has helped me to see my own life a little clearer.  She has been very supportive and given me some very constructive feedback on what I know I need to do, but the things I keep putting off.  I spent a very sleepless night after talking with her as my mind raced to deal with the many things I need to do.  One conclusion that I have come to is that I need to live my house in the inner city.  As delightful as it has been for the last 5 years, I think a move will be good for me.  In the long run, I think I will go back to living in the bush.  Hopefully alone with much privacy and peace.  As part of the move, I think I will sell most of my belongings, including the TV and other things that have come to dominate my life.  My friend JJ has given me the inspiration to live a far more simple life, so I can spent time reading more often (which I really love but seem to have little time for) and maybe jump into gardening on a much bigger scale with my grass roots lifestyle that I used to have before I moved into the city.    City life has been good for some things, I have tried to not get into the 'keeping up with the Jones' thing that so many people have when living in the country, but slowly my house and life have come to a point that it is so full or unneeded things that I really need to work out what is best for me.  Me, that is the focus now.  No partner.  My only dependant is Sam, as Montie has been re-homed with a new owner who I think he will fit in well with.  Me - what do I want in life?  I think this will be the project I have to work on.

      A friend tells me that he is thinking of spending about $25,000 (AU) on a new motorbike that he wants.  He has not got the cash for it and was thinking of adding it to his mortgage.    He is a single guy, about 40'ish, real nice personality and loves to keep fit.    During our conversation he made a very interesting point about this whole idea of getting a new bike, and it makes me wonder about my own feelings to this sort of question:   Would a new bike make me more attractive?   Ahhh, the twenty five thousand dollar question!  What do you say?    Me?  Well I would not be more attractive to someone who has a flash motorbike, however (oh how I love that word)!, it might be different if I had a true understanding of what a new motorbike is like.  I did some further self thought about my own views.  Would you believe that I really really REALLY hate one brand of motor car, in particular I hate a model of one brand of car - the Hyundai Excel.  Just the name makes me ill!   I hate the car because of the way it was built, the way it was marketed, the shape, the design and even the people who drive them!     Yes, it is true - I am as shallow as they come!  Why can one person hate something like this so much and would I date someone who owned one?  About the car.     *  It was so poorly built, that the service log of the car includes a body re-weld every 50,000 kms.  That’s right folks, the car will come apart in the middle because if was so poorly built unless you pay to have it fixed every year or two!   *  The car was marketed here in Australia as a 'fun car that will make you popular'.  The sad fact is that so many of them were sold here in AU that you have to ask the question - Did we really have so many people who lives are so sad that they needed to buy this car to make them happy and popular?   *  The shape?  Besides looking like some 2 door shit box, the car has no style, just look at the cheap transmission stick!   *  The design was a 'quick and cheap' throw together that had not taken into account the simple things like - ergonomics.  Wait until we have all these Excel owners with crap backs and sore necks in a few years time!  Last of all, the people who drive them are sad looking people.  If you are one of these people - think about it all.  You got a car because if was marketed to you as fun!  What is this saying about your life’s?  Are they really that sad that you needed a car to tell people that you are now # hello; I am a fun person in my fun car #.  Often I find most people who drive these cars are shithouse drivers with little or no driving ability.  One day I saw on go around a corner, mount the side rail and smash into a fence.  I got out and asked the driver what happened - she said that she got the brake and petrol peddles mixed up!!  Shit love, what are you doing on the roads with a car?  Do you know how dangerous a car is if misused?  You could kill someone!  You could kill me!!  So, would I date someone who owned one of these cars?  No!  I dont care if it is some beefy, drop dead guy!  I want someone who has style and safety in mind when they buy a car.  I am happy to say that I would be happy to date a guy with a 20 year old Volvo, as long as the car was road worthy and the drive was not reflated to the Dukes of Hazard!  Hate Volvo's or love them, you have to admit, the cars just keep going and going.  It is because they are a very well designed car and quality built.    Bet we dont have many Excels around when they are 20 years old.  What about you?  Are you as shallow as me?  Maybe you hate is not cars, maybe it is clothes, maybe it is money!

      When I was a kid, my mum and dad used to have a great garden.  Dad would spend most of his free time pottering about the garden and as a result, we had a wonderful supply of fresh fruit and vegetables for most of my childhood.    One day it hit me about how much better off I was when I had a meal at a friend’s house and the fruit and vegetables were tasteless and horrible.  The tomato was woody and had no flavour.  After this experience, I managed to get these friends to try a home grown tomato that dad had produced.  They were amazed.  How could a simple tomato have so much flavour?  It was a few years later after I moved to out of home when I was shopping around for fruit and vegetables when I worked out that I could no longer survive on the shop types of stuff.  I started my own garden at the time; it was easy to do as I had a constant supply of stable mulch coming out of the horse stables.  I started out with a small space which over time grew and grew.  My garden was not taking much of my time (not as much as have horses did) and yet the garden was coming along very well.  I stuck to the same principals of my mum and dad with no chemicals and still my garden produced more stock then I needed.    At its peak, I was suppling four households, plus half of my workplace with fresh food that many people had never really tasted before.  Everyone was hooked and wanted to know how to start a little garden for themselves.  I had invited my then current boss over to my house to see my garden and I showed her something special to do with a real vine ripened tomato.  She loved salt on her food; it would be to the extreme when she salted something!  We picked a few tomatoes; I cut them into bite sized chunks as we sat outside in the warm artuum sun.  I added fresh cracked black pepper as I directed her to open a very cold bottle of crisp dry white wine.  Then on each chunk, I place a small salty anchovy.  We sat for about two hours, with cold wine in hand as we slowly devoured our plates full of the fresh tomatoes with a simple topping.  It was a delightful experience, one that my former boss would never stop talking about for the next 12 months.  Now days my experience with growing fruit and vegetables has been limited for the last few years.  My current house had no garden when I moved into it; the soil was dead, hard and nothing wanted to grow.  Slowly I have started to build the gardens up, growing a nice range of flowers and shrubs which have started to help condition the soil making it much better to grow things in.  My compost heap is coming along very well, although I do miss not having stable mulch on tap like I used too.  On my dad’s last visit, my dad looked at the area that I have marked out for a garden bed, the soil is very poor and I hope to build it up for next spring’s vegetable garden.  I guess the test will be in the taste - when next summer vegetables are ready to fill my own and my friend’s tables.

      One of the hobbies that I have is traveling around the country side of Austrlaia and once again I am off on the open roads to clock up some more milage.  This time I am heading off to the town of Nabiac on the north coast of NSW.  For something different I am taking along one of my oldest friends (Judith) who I have known for many many years.  She and I get on so well that sometimes we have been known to laugh at nothing and laugh until it hurts our bodies.  We had a good friend who used to live down here until she got jack of the place and got a job as a bank manager on the north coast.  Now days she has plenty of time to do what she wants to, gone are the days of when she used to work in a call centre, working shitty shifts and putting up with people giving you a hard time over the telephone.    Now days she is helping people to get there own homes and it is amazing how people dont tend to be as abusive when you deal with them face to face, unlike the days of working in a telecentre.  She has done well.  Her mum has moved up to the same area and manged to buy a lovely property with a small business to keep herself active and she enjoys meeting people (most of whom are all on holidays and in good spirits).  I hope to return home after about 4 days away, it is nice that my friend Judith has had an oppertunity to get away and I am sure that she was very delighted to see our friends and a new part of the country.  The weather is delightfully warm at the moment which warms my soul.

      About a year ago, I was walking along deep in thought when I had what can only be discribed as a Carrie Bradshaw moment.  Who is Carrie Bradshaw I hear you ask?  We she is the main charicture in the tv show, Sex in the City.  Carrie Bradshaw is played by Sarah Jessica Parker.  Like in the TV show, often I think to myself much like Carrie would.  Asking myself questions about every day life issues as they often unfold before my eyes.  Around the same time I was into reading someone elses daily blog in the web and I thought to myself that this could be a posative thing for me to see how life changes and to get a better idea of my own emotions.  This blog was not to entertain people, nor to be some gossip type of thing.  It is for my own interest, my own learning and if someone else reads it, fine.  It is not my deepest thoughts - sorry.  I guess it is alos a little like that with my own web page.  That I have had for many years.  It has been a real learning experence and it is also a useful place to manage my on going long term memory issues.  One of the good things about getting in contact wiht people from my primary school has helped to build those missing years and missing memories.  Over all I guess that is what life is all about; learning and growing from all life experences.  This is just another experence.

      I dont know why, but I woke up with morning with two songs in my head.  Both have some significane in my life.  The first one was  Bucks Fizz, Land of make believe . The second one is an only  Marianne Faithfull song, Ballad Of Lucy Jordan .  Stars in your eyes, Little one, Where do you go to dream, To a place, We all know, The land of make believe  Shadows, Tapping at your window, Go see, Voices whisper will you come andplay?  Not for all the tea in China, All the corn in Carolina, Never, Never ever They're running after you  Run for the sun, Little one, You're an outlaw once again, Time to change, Superman, He'll be with us while he can, In the land of make believe  Something, Nasty in your garden's, Waiting patiently, 'Till it can have your heart,  Try to go, But it won't let you, Don't you know it's out to get you, Running, Keep on running They're running after you  Run for the sun, Little one, You're an outlaw once again, Time to change, Superman, He'll be with us while he can, In the land of make believe  Your world is turning, From night to day, Your dream is burning far away  Into the blue, You and I, To the circus in the sky, Captain Kids, On the sand, With the treasure close at hand, In the land of make believe  In the land of make believe  Run for the sun, Little one, You're an outlaw once again, Time to change, Superman, He'll be with us while he can, In the land of make believe  Run for the sun, Little one, You're an outlaw once again, Time to change, Superman, He'll be with us while he can, In the land of make believe  (Little girl) I've got a friend who comes to tea, And no-one else can see but me, He came today, But had to go, To visit you? You never know   Marianne Faithfull song, Ballad Of Lucy Jordan  The morning sun touched lightly onthe eyes of Lucy Jordan.  In a white suburban bedroomin a white suburban town.  And she lay there neath the covers dreaming of a thousand lover stil the world turned to orange and the room went spinning round.  At the age of 37 she realized she'd never ride through Paris in a sports car with the warm wind in her hair.  So she let the phone keep ringing as she sat there softly singing pretty nursery rhymes she'd memorizedin her Daddy's easy chair.  Her husband he's off to work and the kids are off to school and there were oh so many ways for her to spend her days.  She could clean the house for hours or rearrange the flowers or run naked through the shady street screaming all the way.  At the age of 37 she realized she'd never ride through Paris in a sports car with the warm wind in her hair.  So she let the phone keep ringing as she sat there softly singing pretty nursery rhymes she'd memorizedin her Daddy's easy chair.  The evening sun touched gently on the eyes of Lucy Jordanon the roof top where she climbed when all the laughter grew too loud.  And she bowed and curtsied to the man who reached and offered her his handa nd he led her down to the long white car that waited past the crowd.  At the age of 37 she knew she'd found forever as she rode along through Paris with the warm wind in her hair.
