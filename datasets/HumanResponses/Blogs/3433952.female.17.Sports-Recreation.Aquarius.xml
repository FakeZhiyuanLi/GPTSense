      In open fields of wild flowers, She breaths the air and flies away She thanks her Jesus for The daises and the roses in no simple language Some day she'll understand. The meaning of it all,  He's more than laughter or the stars in the heaven As close as a heartbeat or song on her lips, Someday she'll trust him and learn how to see him. Some day He'll call her and she will come running Fall in his arms, the tears will fall down and she'll pray  I want to fall in love with you. I want to fall in love with you. I want to fall in love with you. I want to fall in love with you.  Sitting silent wearing Sunday best, The sermon echoes through the walls A great salvation through it Calls to the people who stare into nowhere And can't feel the chains on there souls.  It seems to easy to call you "Savior" Not close enough to call you "God" So as I sit and think of Words I can mention to show my devotion.

      Okay word up to all you mother forks! I don't understand what I am talking about so I should shutup... but since for some reason I have been given the insane ability to type to a rather "large capacity" (BIG WORDS GO MEEEEEEE) ummm I'm probably just gonna blab on for a while cuz I definetly do not want to do my science homework cuz well that would just be something that someone smart (s-m-r-t) would do. Therefore let the blabbing commence! Ummm so the other day in practice I didn't do all 3 laps cuz of my foresaken (don't ask me what that means cuz I really  don't know)ankle and so Cathlene told me I wasn't gonna play in the game... but I ended up playing the second game anyways... and guess what?!?!?!? WHO GOT A TRY! ME YES ME!!! WOOOOOT! I was happy! I was YEAH THAT'S FOR MY HOMEDAWGS! haha yeah I sat right on my butt I was like uh huh that's enough for me! hee hee:D so ummm.... life in a treehouse... damn mornings would suck the bag! haha I had practice today and I got tackled and I heard my OTHER leg of all things SNAP! it was gross then I was like sick to my stomach so Cathlene told me to sit out... and I did... and then they gave us CHOCOLATE BARS! I was sooo happy I almost cried! hahah but then... I lost my mouthguard... so now I'm scared cuz mom's gonna freak! AH! too much talking

      On our way out Whispering the bitter sweet words of I'll Miss You, in your ear. The tears ripping at my throat but held back for fear of being noticed. To be seen as weak, small and nothing else to give. I pray that you'll always understand. And a deep breathe is taken in to remember, the sweet smell untill I return to you again.

I could write a song about thinking but then once I think about that I don't think that I want to write a song at the moment... not about thinking.

      I'm bored... and should be doing my project but I am not only bored I am stupid and I don't do things that I should do like my project. If I had a giant bat I'd probably wack myself with it like twenty times right now.................... blooob ... just to let anyone who's going to bother reading this... I'm going to complain the entire time!      I HATE FRENCH HISTORY! I don't know why he is making us do such a HUGE project right at the end of the year RIGHT before exams when we should be going over the exams stuff! It's way too stressful like everyone is through a cow over it! and the stupid thing is like useless information that no one will ever use or care about in their freakin lives! URG!  I would very much enjoy RIPPING my stupid teeth off right about... NOW! aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! They hurt and Matty even gave me drugs and they didn't do crap all and I was not impressed and then at Rugby Stupid stupid stupid stupid coaches friggen made me be "Hooker" (and yes I did say Hooker, for those of you losers out there that do not know a hooker is a position on a Rugby team) and I do not like being hooker and I friggen tackled the crap outta someone but then I like smashed onto my stomach and my head hit the ground and I almost threw up it was SO gross! and then someone punched me in the face right on my teeth and I almost threw a brick! I dislike many things that are happening
