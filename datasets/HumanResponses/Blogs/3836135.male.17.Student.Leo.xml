      Depending on whom you ask the answers to this age-old question range from “absolutely” to “absolutely not” and the fact of the matter is that there is no universal truth on this one. In some cases guys and girls can be the best of friends but in other cases any truly platonic relationship is virtually impossible. It all depends on how the friendship started, whether or not there is a physical attraction involved be it one sided or mutual, and on the personalities of the individuals. There really is no good reason why members of the opposite sex can’t have important and close friendships with one another and the objections of those who think it is impossible stem mostly from a crude  cultural belief that all men want any woman they can get their hands on and that they view each and every woman as sexual objects first and real people second.   This is just plain stupid and does a disservice to males and females. While there are situations where physical attraction is a factor to contend with it rarely is so overwhelming that it makes a friendship impossible and when it does happen that physical attraction or lust gets in the way of being friends it isn’t always the guy who is struggling with those feelings.  Yes, girls do lust after guys as much as guys lust after girls.  It is not something that is exclusive to the male half of the species. Whether or not that lust stifles a budding friendship or destroys an existing one is entirely dependent on the person having the feelings. So bottom line, yes guys and girls can be friends if they really want to be friends. It only gets complicated if there is physical attraction involved and then only if the people involved don’t deal with it properly. What is the proper way to deal with this complication? You have to be up front about things.  If you feel an attraction you have to let your friend know and be prepared for an answer you won’t want to hear. You must also be prepared to work through your feelings and make the friendship a priority over your broken dreams of romance.  If you are the person being admired you must be prepared to be honest in your rejection, to make it clear you only want a friendship and to show that you mean it by sticking it out through the difficult post-declaration adjustment period. After that a friendship can definitely bloom.  There are some simple rules to make a boy-girl friendship a success:      Don’t cross the line of friendship EVER without realizing it may be a point of no return.    If you know your friend harbors deeper emotions toward you you must NEVER take advantage of those feelings to control your friend or get him/her to do what you want.   NEVER give in to physical attractions without knowing that it could change the friendship forever and in an irreversible way.   Respect that you will have different perspectives on important things because hey, you experience the world culture from two opposing realities.   Know that there will always be people who scoff at the validity of opposite-sex friendships and that they are the ones losing out, not you.
