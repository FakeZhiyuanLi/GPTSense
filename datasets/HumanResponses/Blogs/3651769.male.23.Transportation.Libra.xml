      you have to stay up for conan! he makes me laugh so much sometimes i wake people around the house. this is from my journal... ok i'm changing the way i refer to it, i hate the way journal sounds, that sets the assumption that i keep a personal record of occurrences, experiences, and reflections on a regular basis. the thing is, i just use it randomly for very different things, sometimes even as a fan.  from now on i'll refer to "the journal" as "the scrapbook." a long time ago, during a lunch break at the previously mentioned boring job, i wrote this:   A Step    a step, an archive a reminder of things now gone a form of vessel slowly tugging me away to lie  should i walk fast? my mind is asleep  welcoming my tears to fall it hits the floor it coalesces forming other tender shapes of me  this sole step right here takes me far  brings me near  this sole step right here walks towards light walks from fear this sole step right here!...  the moment i step away from here  would there be anyone to miss? the steps that have gone before me near i wonder if the regret....to step  and i step...and still step  the moment i step away from here i would surpass every other step i've had the steps that have gone before me fear i wonder if the regret to taste to walk away to breath new life to love a one to step that final step  and i step...and step   this is my favorite of all.. i even titled it and all.. i rarely do that.

      i doesn't let me list all my favorite bands. i know it doesn't say fav bands....but what am i suppose list them under? i hate giving classifications to bands because all the music and songs most bands write are not the same style... it varies from record to record. so here's the rest of the list: janes addiction, killswitch engage, marilyn manson, the mars volta, modest mouse, mogwai, new order, nine inch nails, nirvana, norma jean, nortec collective, placebo, radiohead, rage against the machine, sigur ros, stone temple pilots, sunnyday real estate, tool, underworld, weezer. and there's more believe it or not. my all time favorite is NIne Inch Nails.

      i love my car. it's a VW GTi 1.8T 2002. if you don't know what that is....it's the best hatchback around. and it's my favorite color, black. i was getting searching for a flash light in the back of the car earlier and i found a piece of paper with writings on it. i remember when i wrote this i was working at popular electronics store here in San Diego. i used to get really bored and had to find ways to kill time. i spaced out a lot at that job, everyone always thought i was high. i really hated that job, every dept has between 50-100 employees... the store had 8 depts. it's a really huge store. the reason i hated and why i ended walking out on it is because no one was mature, there was always rumors and lies and problems circulating around. amidst all that, this is what i did to ignore them all:    cry and cry again make the tears roll down all the way, taking life away show the world what you meant to say because when they hit the floor; then comes the end while others come to do the same, soon to realize it's been done before silence falls when they hit the floor the sound that never ends the sounds that soothes the ears yet it makes you fill with tears  so cry and cry again because it'll never be the same and nothing is as it seems and the tears that caused you pain they will never end those that try again those that want some change those that make a sound the sound that never ends the ones that hit the floor never to return the ones you must let go  cry and cry again like nails that pierce the skin like bites that want to please because when i hit the floor like i've done before will it be the same? will there be an end? or will you be there on the floor?   it was a really long day so i had time to flip the paper over and write something else   i've felt those lips, those eyes, that skin i've felt until felt turned sin how do i express what you do? it's just too hard to understand you i'm angry because i want you near but it's you i fear it's you i need i have been in light  i have been in dark nothing is there i fear nothing is there that hurts except when you're away except when i'm alone i have felt those lips and i have felt those eyes i have touched that skin in the end it's you i near   these are to no one in particular, it's what i would say to that particular.

      i hate sleeping at night. i'm incredibly more productive at night then i am during the day. i love the night. i like the way the night hides things from your sight. sight is probably one of the most convincing forms of senses we have.... it's kind of the confirmation for everything(unless your blind). i don't like to be told everything, i like to explore or make things up with my imagination, and daylight kind of ruins that. it doesn't leave anything to the imagination. everything is there laid out on the table.... don't get me wrong, i'm not an insomniac... i love to sleep, but it's mostly done during the day, or not done at all, my workday starts at 8AM. Believe me as soon as i can, i go home and take a nap. as soon as i wake up, i get ready to begin my night life.

      i hope i use this, i'm the type of person that writes on random pieces of paper(about anything)folds it up and loses it. i have a blue journal(if you can call it that) that's falling apart, and a black box with a leather outer lining (nicely decorated with hundreds of stickers)that's falling apart because i have thousands of "random thought" papers crushed in it. hopefully with time i might get both  cataloged in here. i'm addicted to putting thoughts and stuff on paper and then putting them away. which would be a little difficult to post on here. because i don't know if i'd have the papers with me still, and that would really upset me. although if i get around to posting everything else i have stored away, that would be more then enough to read and would kind of nice, i know i'm bound to read something i probably forgot about. well you're going to get to know me in depth. might as well give you the basic. i'm 23, i live in san diego, i'm going to a 4 year university ( of which i've been attending longer then that), i love music, i love music, i love music, i'm male, i'm not much of a disclosing type of guy...i like to be asked questions, then i'll answer(not because i'm selective about it, but because i can never seem to cover everyones curiosity. i guess i should treat this like a journal... so that means i'll have to think of a name. i'll do that later. ok good bye.

      I'm absolutely exhausted. I just worked 3 days in a row from 8 am till 9ish. And I'm still up. The weekends that I work like this I usually only get like 4 hours of sleep and I hate it cuz I love sleeping but just hate the thought that something important might be missed in the process. So I'm damn weird. Do something.  on a lighter note another little thing I wrote while bored at my previous job    Not all is what it seems when I'm with you.....My control is lost. I want to see if I can be deeper in, and if I can, I want to be sure. because I always want to feel I can be better. and even after all your screams..... I want to understand why you don't just run and feel surprised, because I know if you reach the end...... you'll always be tempted to look back and cry again. still, I'll always assume it will all be just like it was before..... and never completely close my eyes.

      I know I haven't written in a while, I've been real busy working open to close and camping these past few weeks. I really haven't had any time to spare. But things should Settle back to normal again. I just got back from camping, and should have more days off now. Anyways.....I found it in my blue notebook.....It was originally some random thing I wrote for someone that passed away, and was very dear to me, a long long time ago (I might explain later). It's an actual event in my life. I later wanted to make it part of lyrics for a song I had recorded ......But couldn't find it. Enjoy.    slowly stumbling recovering from this sorting what you said never looking back as simple words caress I chose to disappear 'i fear the worst' he said 'cuz nothing else remains' no more lies no more cries no more tears to shed away to walk away  to love a one to move a step to feel your last warm kiss  your lips your eyes your skin your tears  to feel the pain again the you that I will miss
