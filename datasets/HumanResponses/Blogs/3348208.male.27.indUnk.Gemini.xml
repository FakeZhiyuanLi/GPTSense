      "Sooner or later we all discover that the important moments in life are not the advertised ones, not the birthdays, the graduations, the weddings, not the great goals achieved. The real milestones are less prepossessing.  They come to the door of memory unannounced, stray dogs that amble in, sniff around a bit and simply never leave. Our lives are measured by these"   - SUSAN B ANTHONY (1820-1906) American reformer

      Not a hell of a lot to report... about to head to work for a few hours.  I'm thinking about going to  urlLink Baxter State Park  this Saturday, depending on the weather.  Prolly just hike in to Chimney Pond and back out - 6 miles of wilderness hiking oughta be plenty for the first trip of the year.  I haven't been up there for at least 5 years; will be fun if it works out. Ouch, runnin late already, off I go.....

      I quit smoking, apparently a month ago.  I found Quitnet the day I quit.  It has been a great source of motivation and support for me, especially during the first two "hell" weeks.  Corny and cliche as it may be, I don't know if I could have done it without them. This is the email I received from them today:    WHO'S BETTER THAN YOU TODAY? You've made it! A whole 1 months without a cigarette! In that time, you've successfully navigated the stormy Weather of Withdrawal; you've sailed right over the Depths of Depression; you've managed to keep afloat over the Rapids of Relapse.  WHO'S BETTER THAN YOU TODAY? Countless times you've refused the offered cigs. More times than that you've craved nicotine, but opted for health, instead. You've endured teasing, lack of support, and feeling uncomfortable and out of place among smokers. You may have had issues with weight, anger, tension or sadness, but still you stayed SMOKE-FREE!  WHO'S BETTER THAN YOU TODAY? You're adjusting to a whole new lifestyle. You're already thinking different thoughts. You've changed habits and routines. You've made new friends and, perhaps, let go of some old ones. You're starting to realize the benefits of living a SMOKE-FREE life. More and more, you see yourself as a non-smoker. We hope you're as proud of you as we are.  WHO'S BETTER THAN YOU TODAY? And while you've been doing all this for yourself, you've been helping everyone here at the Q. Your membership in our community has demonstrated an ongoing support of the efforts of all of us. We hope you stay with us as you continue your SMOKE-FREE journey.  WHO'S BETTER THAN YOU TODAY?     Time Smoke-Free: 29 days, 22 hours, 26 minutes and 58 seconds   Cigarettes NOT smoked: 748   Lifetime Saved: 5 days, 17 hours   Money Saved: $156.00

      So... I guess this is where this whole Blog experience becomes typical.  I really have no idea what I'm trying to accomplish with this, maybe I'm searching for a sense of accomplishment, of having done something with my mind. I worked all afternoon, then came home and downloaded some new music - I HEART PIRACY!  Fairly normal day....as I wrack my brain nothing of any significance comes to mind.  My friend sent me a funny email. Yesturday we had been talking about LARPing (live action role playing) and how god damn retarded it seemed.  Apparently his brother actually knows people who do this - some sort of vampire game. So they actually dress up like gothic/Matrix wanna-be's and run around someone's house pretending to be vampires... I guess *shrug*.  So today I get an email from him, with a link to a  urlLink  VIDEO   of some freaks actually doing this shit.  I have no idea what game this is they are playing, but it appears to be some sort of medeival D&D type lunacy.  Good for a laugh.

      Jynx me something crazy Thinking if it's three then I'm as smooth as the skin rolls across the small of your back It's too bad it's not my style If you need me I'm out and on the parkway, patient and waiting for headlights, dressed in a fashion that's fitting to the inconsistencies of my moods

      There's something about baseball.  There's nothing more American than sitting in metal bleachers on a hot sunny day, getting sunburned, sippin water and watching chance play itself out in front of you on the diamond.  It provides clarity, at that moment nothing matters more than if Izzy can get a base hit or sac fly for the RBI, or if Harris can pitch a ground ball to turn the double play.  We all need something that is what baseball is to me..... especially in a time like this when you can't look at the cover of a newspaper without feeling the need to vomit.  Find it.
