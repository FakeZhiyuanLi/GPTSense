      (WARNING - some of these include descriptions that may give away the story, so if you run across any you haven't seen, you may not want to read my comments)  I couldn't possible list them all in one sitting, and I can't remember the names to half of the good ones. Some of the misspellings are just that, some are spelled wrong on purpose for effect. Plus, I'm sure the times blur between what I've put under "old" and "new". Oh well.  Old Comedies - 70s / 80s - love stupid movies MP's Quest for the Holy Grail - medieval stuff rocks! "... and there was much rejoicing" "yea"; "I can handle them, there's only 150 of them" "Oh yes, let him handle, me" "and me" "and me" MP's Life of Brian - awesome song at the end Spaceballs - spoof on Starwars, nonstop laughs Blazing Saddles - Racial issues put to comedy and there's always the homosexual 	bits. "Need any help?" "Oh... all that I can get." Caddy Shack - lots of great actors rolled into one movie - have you seen the 		commercial with Tiger Woods doing a spoof on this bit? Love it! Animal House - good old college days The Blues Brothers - cool, cool guys, great music Vacation - it's funny 'cause it's true Strange Brew - drunk Canadians make me laugh Ghost Busters - first one - Who you gonna call? The Goonies - goofy kids my age having adventures - loved it. Ferris Beuler's Day Off - don't you wish you could get away with this stuff? 	(I've just got to say that Matty was an awesome actor back then, when he did this one, War Game, Lady Hawk and that one about the monkeys. Whatever happened to his acting? Every movie he's in now, he just acts like he doesn't give a crap. Dude, even if the movie is a flop, put some effort back into it! Please!)  New Comedies - 90s / 00s - love stupid movies Happy Gilmore - golfball wacker guy, "The price is wrong, bitch!" Waynes World - first one - we need more movies about garage bands, like 		Airheads, only better Austin Powers - all of them, but the first was the best Princess Bride - rocks! "Have fun storming the castle!" Fear and Loathing in Los Vegas - on the darker side, but Depp is hilarious and 		pulls off the character great. I didn't recognize him the first time I saw it. Cool 	effects. The Wedding Singer - great music and 80s flashbacks Benny & June - Depp's cutest role Pirates of the Carrabean - Doesn't Depp act a bit like he did in Fear & Loathing?  Old Dramas - love good music, some make me cry The Breakfast Club - LOVE the music, funny bits, reminds me of high school, but 	the lines weren't quite so clearly cut between the groups. They had to amplify it a bit to get the point across for the flick. (Plus at my high school, every kid except for about 5 of us had a Southern drawl.) Stand By Me - leeches and puke and boys bonding, oh my Gorillas in the Mist - cool woman protecting wildlife Mask - about a deformed boy - makes me cry The Color Purple - hard to watch - it's so sad, but such a good story Sarafina - great musical about kids joining the fight in Africa - makes me cry  New Dramas / Action - love plot twists, some make me cry The Crow - with Brandon Lee - what a bad ass, that flick still gives me shivers Braveheart - medieval stuff rocks, still makes me cry Trainspotting - great music, cool dudes with a nasty habit, cool effects The Edge - outdoor living at its best The Game - love movies with plot twists Fight Club - love movies with plot twists The Doors - love the music, cool effects Girl Interrupted - love the music playing when she finds the girl who hung herself - 	eerie.  Chocolat - love the story, great music, funny bits Forrest Gump - great story, music and acting - good restaurants based on this flick Big Fish - great story - makes me feel like a kid again The Passion - "like" isn't the right word to describe how I feel about this movie. It 		didn't make me cry, it made me SOB. Never thought a movie could alter my religious outlook to such an extent. I let down my defenses, forgot my criticism, and sobbed. After seeing it, I no longer wonder if it was made for the right reasons.  Fantasy - love fairy tales Never Ending Story - first one - great kids adventure story Labrynth - David Bowie in tights, awesome puppetry, funny bits The Dark Crystal - more awesome puppets, love fairy tales, cool knot-work art in 	the credits and sets, even good music with the pipes Heavy Metal - the first one - Great music, good animation, good story Willow - cool music, sets, costumes, funny bits Connan - kick ass, good music Lady Hawk - medieval stuff rocks, good music, Howard is so sexy - love the scene 	where he's slowly changing back into a human and they try to touch and he 	yells... oh my Gawd. Also the part where she's hanging from the tower, falls as the sun comes up, and her scream changes into a bird cry. Kewel. Legend - great music, costumes, sets, etc., love fairy tales LOTR - all 3 were great renditions of the original story, good acting, awesome music, sets, special effects, etc. Love them.  Sci-fi / Horror - love weird, creepy movies X-Files - the movie and all the shows were great - the truth is out there :-) 28 Days Later - WOW, great acting, camera work, etc. They really pulled it off. 		When I watch that one, I feel like I'm there and that stuff is happening. Star Trek Next Generation flicks - good acting, good stories Blade Runner - way before it's time - great flick about artificial intelligence, good 	acting, I love the scene at the end when Howard talks about all the things 	he's seen and now it's "Time to die". Brazil - just weird Invasion of the Body Snatchers - I hate the part where he screams at the end Children of the Corn - first one - creepy kids, high squeeky voice The Birds - Classic Hitchcock Carie - original - someone once said I reminded him of her, back when I was a bit 	sheltered, must have been the long, straight hair Ringu - original version of the Ring - you have to read subtitles, but it's still scarier 	than the American version - nightmares for months  Well, these are all that come to mind right now. I'm sure I'll think of others later.

      I like to chew gum, but lately I've had some costly visits to the dentist. She told me to cut out the sugar filled gum. She said gum with Splenda would be fine. Gums with Splenda:  Dentyne Sugarfree (cool mint)  Arm & Hammer Dental Gum for Kids  Warner-Lambert Co. Trident for Kids(tm) Sugarless Gum Berry Bubble Gum  Only problem is I found an article online saying that Splenda has negative side effects:  *	Shrunken thymus glands (up to 40% shrinkage) *	Enlarged liver and kidneys *	Atrophy of lymph follicles in the spleen and thymus *	Increased cecal weight *	Reduced growth rate *	Decreased red blood cell count *	Hyperplasia of the pelvis *	Extension of the pregnancy period *	Aborted pregnancy *	Decreased fetal body weights and placental weights *	Diarrhea  Wonder if this is true... :-( What to do...
