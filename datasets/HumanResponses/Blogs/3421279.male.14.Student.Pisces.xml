      Under My Skin was released in Singapore on 24th May 2004 and I went around the CBD to look for it even though I had fractured a 3 toes, but there was no Under My Skin.  In the end, my friend found it at Century Square and helped me buy it.  I was so grateful.  Anyway, you can go get it now.  It costs $17.90 in Sembawang stores and it comes with a poster of her and a secret password to enter a contest to win tickets to her private concert.  Quickly get the album now, the posters are limited and the contest ends on 31st July. Signing off ;)

Anybody can take good photos, but if you have a creative flare, you'll be fantastic.  Anyway, photography can be learnt to a certain extent, so i'll teach what i know. ;)

      Don't Tell Me has been going down the Perfect 10 top 20 charts from the highest it ever got no. 2 all the way down to no. 6 this week.  It went up to no. 4 on mtv trl but it went down on the billboard charts.  Anyway, My Happy Ending is gonna be released and take the world by storm!  I'm sure it'll hit NO.1!!!

      Yes!  It's final and official that Avril's next single is My Happy Ending off her album, Under My Skin.  So go tell all your friends about what you just learnt and spread the love for Avril.  Anyway, if you haven't bought her album, quick get one now!  HURRY!!! As I was saying about posters, you can buy them from www.avril-lavigne.com or if you're from Singapore, go to the HMV at The Heeren Shopson the 3rd floor out side the classical section (if I remember correctly).  Go Crazy about Avril, Fans!

      I'm not that type who knows poster shops but I was so excited when I found 2 Avril posters at The Heeren Shop's HMV.  I was just looking around and I found them.  Anyway, Avril fans from Singapore can go there and buy them, their numbers are 32 & 36 but be warned, they cost $14 EACH, so be prepared with $28.  Ok that's all!

       I found that there haven't been new albums worth buying these few weeks.&nbsp; This must be the reason why Fadhil(Faith Hill) resorted to Utada Hikaru.&nbsp; Aiyah, this kind of people!
