      The first day it was nice to be able to dispense my news a little at a time. I could pick those whom I would tell. I knew my control over this was pretty limited. Especially since I work at a church. Information travels quickly. I found it important to tell only those who could 1) handle the news without freaking out 2) could give me immediate support in their reaction, and 3) would allow me to talk.   The evening the diagnosis was confirmed, I went to visit my friend Toni. We've known each other for 15 years and I wanted to tell her in person. (Somehow The Telling was easier in person --- I knew the tellees could sense that I was OK and, of course, we could hug.) It was so helpful to me to 1) have some liquor handy, 2) sit and talk. She took me out for sushi and drinks that evening and we laughed and had a good time. It wasn't all about cancer that night. Thank you Toni.    Haven't told my kids, my siblings. The hardest person to tell will be my mother, who was diagnosed with colon cancer two years ago and now doing well. I'm dreading telling her. I'm not ready to hear anyone cry.   Still not scared  I'm a little worried that I'm not feeling this yet. It's been 6 days. I'm not in denial. I believe the pictures the GI doc gave me. But I have no symptoms. Why am I not scared?

      Before  A month ago I was visiting my mother for a few days. We had a lovely visit, ate lots of good food and I was preparing to fly home. The morning of my flight I got sick -- super nausesous, vomiting. My uncle comes to take me to the airport and says, "so you drank too much last night, huh?" Another wave of nausea (Don't ever say that to someone who is about to get into your car.) He drops me at the airport where I stand in the counter line and throw up just as the agent asks my destination. Suddenly people surround me--offering a chair, helping clean me up, escorting me to the restroom where I can rest.  The episode is over and I head home feeling fine. I have a little pain in my upper abdomen. A few days later I see the doctor because I suspect my gallbladder is the problem. She orders test which all show me and my Gall bladder, pancreas and liver are healthy specimens. Blood pressure is great. Doc says I could sell my cholesterol levels they're so good. I'm thinking, well I guess I should avoid eating like I just ate at Mom's.   Oh, and the Dr. suggests I since there's a history of colon cancer in my family (Mom and maternal grandpa) that I should schedule a colonoscopy sometime this summer before I head off to school. No worries. Routine. Gotta do it.  04 June 29  So I'm prepped and ready for my big procedure. Prep isn't as bad as people told me. I've spent worse nights in the bathroom. I take the bus up to the hospital, glad to have a day off from work. The clinic is running late and I'm starving, but I'm getting a lot of reading done while waiting for them to scope me. IV in place.  No worries. The colonoscopy room isn't much. THe nurses and other attendants are helpful and pleasant. The doctor is the guy who smiled at me in the elevator on the way up to the clinic. The Doc tells me about the risks of perforation and assures me he tries to avoid that. Annemarie, RN, thankfully gives me the stuff to put me under.  I feel a little tug. Then a pat on my butt which has been the main object of everyone's attention. Annemarie RN is holding my hand as I gaze through the haze. "A tumor much like you described your mother's " the doc says. I think "that's nice. Thank you Doctor." Annemarie RN is stroking my hand and I suspect NOW that I was spilling my lifestory to her. What a gentle way to hear really bad news.   The next thing I know I'm in the recovery room and my husband is stroking my hair. The Doc has told my husband that he'll rush the pathology results and call in a couple of days. They hand me beautiful photos of my tumor along with the diagnosis -- neoplasm of the digestive tract. I'll put it in my scrapbook.    Thank God for Versed or whatever it was they gave me in there. Colonoscopy was painless. Even the news was painless. In fact, I'm still not feeling anything.  3 July 2004    Weirdly OK  I have wondered how it would feel to hear a diagnosis of cancer hurled at you. I didn't think it would feel like this. In fact four days later I'm still not feeling anything bad.   In fact, I'm feeling a little high. Like when my dad died suddenly and God seemed so much nearer and all my senses were heightened. Everywhere I turn I saw good. I was above all grateful, not scared.  When I got the confirmation of the pathology, I just happened to be having lunch with a priest friend of mine who I hadn't really talked with for months. We'd set up this lunch date weeks ago. After lunch we went to the little chapel at church and prayed.   Two hours after that I had my inaugural appointment with my spiritual director.  We had this planned for a while. She invited me to her home that afternoon. I felt as if God had arranged my schedule for me, handing me from one loving person to the next so I wouldn't have to touch the ground just yet. To my delight, my Spiritual Director, AKA Catwoman, has an abundace of beautiful cats who also ministered to me that afternoon.   So far I had given my news only to a few people who could handle it, who wouldn't fall apart. Who would listen and hear the strange joy in my voice. With Catwoman I started to list all the great things that had just happened to me. 1) I don't have Pancreatic cancer. 2) I'm surrounded by people who love me (God help those who have to go through this alone.) 3)I may not have to go to staff meetings for a long time 4) I think I'm guaranteed to lose 30 lbs through this, maybe more. 5) I was planning to leave for seminary within two months but haven't yet. 6) I still have a job and insurance. 7) I don't have little kids around the house anymnore. The list will continue to grow I'm sure.

      The main reason I want to record my observations is so that I will be able to understand what is helpful and not helpful to a person in my situation. I really am hoping to learn something. Hopefully, through this experience God will make of me a stronger more compassionate person and a kick-ass pastor!  Helpful --- Let me talk. I need to talk. Except for "I love you" --- I don't need to hear much of what others have to say to me.   Helpful ---  Everyone I have told has said --- let me do whatever I can to help you. And I do appreciate that. But specific offers of help have been invaluable. Especially of those things I may not have thought of myself. Jane is going with me to the CT scan --- when they will stage the cancer. Gwyneth offered to call people who need to know things. Steve offered rides when necessary. Others have offered to listen to me, whenever I need to talk. Attorney friends have brought up questions of medical disability -- I wouldn't have even thought of that.   Not helpful --- Someone told me I was "truly a servant of God." What does that mean?  Another said "Not you - you've got your whole life ahead of you." That was almost laughable. This is why I put off telling people for a few days. I also don't need to be preached to.  If you listen  to what I'm saying I know God loves me and I know I'm in God's hands. I really do.  To whom it may concern -- Don't assume you know how I feel.  Listen to me ! I've felt incredibly close to God, and still, after 6 days, not scared of what lies ahead. That may change. But you won't know unless I tell you.
