      "Desperation" by Stephen King is a great book.  It was one of the first Stephen King books that I read (the first being "Four Past Midnight").  The book follows the journey of a group of people who have all been arrested by a cop in the deserted town of Desperation, Nevada.  Johnny Marinville and others have been taken to the town jail in Desperation where they meet.  The evil cop slowly begins to "melt".  He takes one of the hostages, but not before leaving a wolf to stop the group from escaping.  By the grace of God, the young David Carver is able to escape and avoid the wolf.  Eventually they find the people of the town murdered.  The creature that controls the evil cop, known as "Tak", had killed all of the people of Desperation, taken control of all the animals, and is now trying to kill the group.  But they have something on their side, more powerful than any of Tak's creatures.  They have God on their side.  The book's climactic ending leaves the reader satisfied.  I give it 10 out of 10 stars.  Desperation will be made into a made-for-tv movie and will hopefull be finished by the end of this year.

      So here we are.  This is my first blog so bear with me untill I start to get better than this.  Well, where to begin.  I'm 17 and live in a small town of Michigan.  I'm trying to get some of my writing out to the public, and this is probably the simplist way.  I'm also trying to help out some people who may want to become writers on things that I have learned while writing the few stories.  I am also going to review books that i have read.  I also will eventually get into my political views, but not untill I get this stuff down.  I will be posting my first story very soon, so look out for it.  Thanks for reading this much and check back in soon.

      Today, Republicans all over the country are going crazy.  Why?  Because they realize that Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 will be one of the final nails in the coffin of the Republican power machine.  Some of them, who haven't even seen the movie, have already criticized it.  Why?  Because the evil, left wing media told them that it lied....what?  You can't have both sides.  I, personally, haven't been able to see this movie, but i do intend to see it on Monday.  Republicans hate anything that goes against their small world view.  They call these people traitors.  They accuse them of hating America.  They say that the only patriots are the people who agree with their king.  King George the second, will do anything in his power to stop people who shake the foundation of their castle of greed and power.  Today i was listening to the radio and i heard the fool Mark Levin on the radio saying that if Michael Moore loves America, then he would give all the money made from this movie to the U.S.O.  Well if you worked on this movie as hard as he did, then you definatly not give up the money.  That is why I issue this challenge to Mark Levin.  If you feel that this is being unamerican, then i want you to make a 2 hour documentary on why the Democrats are wrong, and I don't want you to make a penny from this movie.  And this movie can't just be put out on video avalible on Sean Hannity's site.  It needs to be put out in over 800 theaters.  And if you do all that, then I'll believe that Michael Moore is lazy and greedy as you described him.  Untill then, shut up you right-wing moron!

      This country is heading down the wrong direction.  At the risk of giving it all away, it's all the Republicans fault.  In the past four years, they have made some of the biggest mistakes in the history of our country.  They underestimated the Al-Quida threat, which lead to the worst attack our country has ever seen.  After 3,000 died, we were told that only Bush could protect us and that anyone who disagreed with them, were unamerican.  And all of the little pushers of the Reublican party found this to be just fine.  They also gave one of the largest tax cuts in history at a time when we have one of the largest deficites in history.  This can not be tolerated.   We must overthrow George W. Bush.  The problem is that most Americans can't tell the difference between Democrats and Republicans.  That is why I ask any Democrats who are reading this to explain the difference to explain to their friends the difference between Republicans and Democrats.  And if there is anyone reading this who doesn't know, then I'll explain to you the difference.  Republicans are against gun control, against a women's right to choose, against gay rights, for religion controling politics, and believe that all problems can be solved by bombing the hell out of it.  Democrats are for gun control, for a womens right to choose, for gay rights, against religion controling politics, and want to understand why the enemy hate us so that we can get them to hate us less.  There is nothing unamerican about being a Democrat.  We want a better America just like the Right says they do.  We do not commit "Treason" or are on the same level of "Terriorism and Despotism".  We love America and they hate Americans.  Simple as that.

      Two days ago I saw the best movie of the year.  Fahrenheit 9/11 is, without a doubt, the best movie of the year.  The right wing has been trying to censor this movie, but find themselves making more people want to see it.  I believe that this movie is one of the most important movies ever made.  Moore shows you how truly mistaken the Bush administration has been over the past four years.  He opens by showing how Bush actually lost the 2000 election (But we already knew that).  He shows the Bush administration has ties to the Saudi Royal Family (and how 15 of the 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia).  He even shows actual video of George Bush saying that he didn't really think about Osama bin Laden.  The most touching moment of the movie is when a mother of fallen soldier reads his final letter home.  Afterwards, the same mother goes to Washington and talks to a Iraqi mother who lost her son in battle.  The Iraqi mother has set up a booth that promotes peace.  A women (if you can even call her that) says that both mothers are set-ups for the movie and implies that the American mother is lying about her son's death.  To paraphrase one of the final lines of the movie, our soldiers make an agreement with us.  The agreement is that they will protect us, so long as we don't send them into harms way unnecessarily.  Because we are against the war, doesn't mean that we hate the soldiers who fight it.  We don't want to see our soldiers die and we don't want to see America fail.  We love America, and this is a movie for anyone who loves America like we do.  Go see it.  If you're a teen, sneek into it.  If your old, wheel into it.  I saw both things when i went to see it.  One interesting thing I noticed was when i saw it, Tuesday at 2:20, the theater was half full.  I can't imagine going to it on opening weekend.  I know that I'll be seeing it again.
