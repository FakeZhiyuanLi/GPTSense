      I swear, i think i'd rather have a rhinocerous toss my salad than have to do anymore moving. Today was a typical Massey operation.  The moving van we rented apparently disappeared from the list of reserved vehicles, the one we got stuck with to replace it is only large enough for half my nutsack, and everytime I tried moving couches and chairs and shit my Aunt Marlene would change her mind about where to put or tell us to make sure we doin't tear anything.  I'm still not finished packing and getting boxes and furniture and shit in the van.  Fuck me this sucks my white ass.

      So, Reco calls me at like 10:30 on Friday morning and says "Wake up and get yo clothes ready...we goin to Atlanta at 1:00."  I'm like "what the hell!"  I was kinda pissed...  I mean, I work hard.  I was tired.  10:30 is way too early in the morning to be interupting my slumber, especially when you consider the fact that I don't have to work for 11 weeks yet I still get paid.    So, we went to Atlanta.  Chillin in the A-T-L.  Rollin key-lo-G style in da 4-0-4.    We went to this mall that has mostly urban clothing stores.  In other words, a mall that only black people shop at.  So, being that I was with 3 black people, plus the fact that I'm 6 and a half feet tall and weigh 230 lbs, i felt pretty safe going there.    My kniggas, here's the beauty: i bought a new suit.  Not just any suit.  This is the first suit I've ever owned....and it is blue.  very blue.  all blue.  It's an all pimp royal blue suit.  And not to be gay nor arrogant, but I look so damn fucking good in this suit.  I about creamed on myself 6 times just looking at myself in the mirror while wearing it.  I am so fucking G in this suit!!!!!!!!!!!!  If you'd like to be seen in public with me as I wear this suit, please try to let me know 2 weeks in advance, as I'm sure the line is forming.    Bitches....they're all bitches, and they will all be MINE.  They will be mine.  oh yes.  They will be mine.  happy monday you royal finchfuckers!  The great caveman has spoken.

      my roomates just bought a combined amount of roughly 250 dollars worth of fireworks and according to them it was all half off, so we have roughly 500 dollars worth of fireworks sitting in our house, its literally about a 9ft by 9ft pile.  im conducting interviews for a documentary i am working on, i am trying to associate media to the deconstruction of moral intensity, so i got a list of psychotherapists i need to talk to, see what crazy junk they have to say.

      ...well, only in my dreams.  alright niggas, i took my first practice exam for my licensure and i got a 74.  around a 75 (70 is considered "passing" for Maryland) is actually what i was shooting for realistically, although i would've loved to have scored higher, of course.  so while this means i have a bit more studying to do, i at least have a decently solid idea of how far i need to progress, how much i need to study, and after i do the little diagnostic part of the scoring, i'll have a good idea about which content areas of the exam i'm still lagging behind on.  so all in all, i'm "pleased".  anyway, just thought i'd let you fucks know how all that went.  bitches.  on a side note, i'm done w/ drabilene.  thank God.  i'm gettin the hell outta dodge after i post this and startin back at OG next week to bust my ass tryin to make money for Balto.  so right on, July's gonna be a good month.  peace, my kniggas.

      Standing outside in the architecture building couryard, I absorbed the sense of good vibe from the falling drizzle sort of taking a break from the enclosure of all these damn walls. Eventually, spacing out a dead gaze into this puddle on the ground, I began to notice the perfection of the tiny drops forming patterns of circles on the surface. Just exactly the size of droplets fell at the precise pace to make a rythmym of circular forms. I don't know how to describe exactly how it was beautiful, but I will just hope that there is already an understanding that this rain and this puddle indeed composed a very beautiful spectacle to watch. Now, I had just been inside in the computer lab trying to come up with a working rythmic pattern myself for this project thingie, and had been experiecing the difficulties involved in making good patterns.  Now fellas, I ask you... how come the natural world seems to make so much sense, and be so fluid at it, but our world, the world of our lives, is so damned deflicted and more or less discombobulated? I will write more on this later.

      I've got a great new idea. I'm going to start a new type pf Art expressionism. A new kind of Performance Art.  I'm gonna go buy a bunch of different colored paint, take it to the mall, take my pants off, dip my nuts in the paint and then draw pictures of flower motifs on the walls. Hell yes. Expressionism at its highest forms

      Fellas, last night I had about the most fucked up dream I've ever had, well at least since the one when I was hanging out with Johnny Cash and he spontaneously combusted. At any rate, here is what went down.  My and my cousin Michael (the twin brother of the aforementioned, bowl-smoking, keeping Daniel sane Amy) and I were chilling in this hotel room.  I'm sitting there watching TV and all of sudden fucking Christopher Walken just shows up and walks across the room toward the bathroom that Michael is in.  About 2 minutes pass and all of a sudden I hear this banshee like scream and Christopher Walken and Michael come hauling ass out of the bathroom chasing each other around the hotel room. Mind you the whole time I'm still watching the TV.  Then they chase each other back in the bathroom and I hear this thud, followed by another girly ass scream.  I walk in the bathroom and I swear to god Chris Walken has got a damned meat cleaver stickin out of his chest, Michael done killed his ass.  So now we all start freaking out. What do we do? Do we call the cops? How the hell do we explain this shit to the Hata's?  Well a light goes off in my head and I think to myself "Who do I know that can get me out of this or who can I use as a scapegoat if all goes wrong?" - DANIEL.  I call up Daniel and he comes over, starts fucking laughing at us because we killed Christopher Walken and then proceeds to tell us that the best thing for us to do is to toss the body over the balcony into the palms trees and shit below and then to haul ass out of there.  So Daniel and I pick up the body and toss and as soon as it hits the ground he says "Oh Wait! I got an even better idea! Lets get the body, stick it in my car and we'll take him to my house, and when we are there we'll cut his ass up into pieces!!!"  He is fucking giddy as hell, like Christmas came early.  So the three of us and the dead Christopher Walken get in the car, go to Daniel's and Daniel proceeds to saw the body up and place it in a big plastic tub deal.  Then he says lets go for a ride, so we get in the car and he says "Ok I'm gonna drive and when  I say "limb" I want you to hand me a piece of Christopher Walken and I'll toss it out the window while I'm driving."  So we do this for about 3 hours and then all of a sudden I wake up.  Now I don't know what to make of this dream or what represents what but I do know this...... DON'T FUCKIN LISTEN TO DANIEL

      man niggas i don't know where silky is.  he probly hasn't even checked his email yet.  at any rate, he'll join when time and space bring him around to it, no sooner or later.  blah blah blah i need to be studying right now but i am choosing to watch people on the acu campus and talk about it on the blog first.  its amazing how boring humanity can be when you talk to them, but how fascinating and entertaining they can be when you just watch them.  i was smoking a cigarette on the steps w/ Ryan before we left so i could get to the library and him to work at the campus center, when all of the God-blessed sudden, the brasilian chica who lives under ryan walked up and was unlocking her door, when she stopped, sniffed, and looked up and asked if we had been smoking.  i said "yes" and she said "this is a non-smoking apt complex", so i just looked at her with a blatantly sexual look and she just rolled her eyes and walked off.  but what she didn't intend for me to see was the faintest hint of a smile that crept on her face during that split second of time before her back was to me.  i know how you Brasilians are...you can't hide from me.  anyway, i love moments like that.  especially when you act just normal enough to pass as not crazy, but just atypical enough to throw off whatever it is they were thinking of saying or doing next since they're confused as to how you'll respond (or w/e).  it was a fun start to the day.  then as i was getting ready to leave for the day, i was listening to more of ryans rants (that should be a column in a newspaper or something; wait no it shouldn't) about how God has fucked him over by not "showing him his love for him" by not answering his prayers of getting this woman to come back to him after he freaked her out after she saw how he really is.  i was like dude, maybe God just wants you to make it happen on your own (among many, many other theories as pertaining to his fucked up situation).  that man is simply amazing.  he thinks he's Job right now (from the bible for any of you bible-ignorant people) and that he's bringing huge amounts of glory to God right now by sticking by him even though he's been completely fucked by him.  blah blah blah.  sorry i don't mean to burden the rest of you with all of this, God knows it doesn't need to be talked about anymore, but i guess i just needed to vent.  along with all the good thats been accomplished by my being out here in the seventh circle of hell (drabilene), i've had to endure almost nightly, depressing, one-sided conversations about his whole stupid fucking dilemma.  needless to say, i go over to Amy's quite often just to eat, chill, smoke the occasional bowl (if i've been good that day and gotten my studies taken care of), watch a movie, and hang out w/ some of her other friends who are still here over the summer.  God bless her, she has kept me sane over the past couple of weeks.  anyway, whatever, this is boring now so i guess i'll go be responsible and study.  where's a fuckitall when you need one???

      I havent slept in like well I dont know maybe a day or something, yesterday I dont know what even happened somehow I slept till like 5pm or so and now all of a sudden I havent slept, yea thats right I laid down last night and then i started kickin and jumpin around and then next thing I know I am at the gym wondering where I am.  But I think I figured it out, theres this medication i take and the medicine says take before bedtime but instead I took it at about 6pm or so and now here I am about 16 hours later and not any bit of sleep to keep me in sync with reality.  I was watching tv at around 4am and then THE TWO TOWERS EXTENDED EDITION CAME ON and I was like whoa new scenes and it was so late I didnt even know what was happening I began to think maybe I lived there or something.  I dont know why I thought that but at 5am most anything you tell yourself soon makes absolute sense.    Also when I got home last night or rather when I got to the place I sleep at last night I came in and the dude who's room I am rentin was there so I was like oh hey, it was late so i didnt know what was goin on, and theres like one nice couch and then one average couch and the guy who owned the nice couch said hey man you can sleep on the average couch you cant sleep on my nice one, and I was like what? arent I renting a room? but then I remembered that I must always be polite so I just slept on the average couch, but I mean isn't it a tad bit weird to have a couch and then to tell your roomates that you cant sleep or eat on it, I MEAN WHAT ELSE IS THERE?  I dont think ive ever just sat on some couch, but I mean whatever to each his own I guess, and now on to the main point time for me to move out into some new random place where I can stay for free, no more payin rent thats a dumb idea payin rent is only for people who have to keep their junk somewhere I have nothing, I have a car here and thats it.  I think I had some other junk to publish but I guess I forgot it due to sleep deprivation... oh YEA WHERE IS SILKY!?!?!? he needs to make his presence known!!

      It seems that all too often I find myself looking in the mirror thinking to myself "what the fuck is wrong with me?"  I fucking hate mirrors.  They're so damn insensitive.  The mirror doesn't care if your hair is thinning, he'll fucking show you.  The mirror doesn't care that you have a big ass birth mark on your elbow, he'll let you know about it.  It's scary to think about the truths that a mirror can behold...much less having to actually see them.  Why can't I be okay with not being okay?  I wanna be 10 years old again.  I want the biggest decision in my life that I have to make is whether I want to be Mario or Luigi, or whether to pick Captain Crunch, Crunch Berries, or that fucked up cereal with the pink frankenstein with the stale ass marshmellows.    Fuck me.  I think Robin Williams had a great idea when he spoke of a drug called "fuckitall."  I could use a big ass fucking glass of fuckitall right now.  Or a bud of fuckitall, or a bowl of fuckitall, or a pipe of fuckitall, or a sheet of fuckitall, or a cap of fuckitall, or whatever the hell kinda form the drug would come in.  I just want some of it.  Hell, you could give a dog some fuckitall, then have the dog bend me over just so i could have some too....  Well, maybe not...then i'd just be back to my current state of being which is "fucked."    My sleeping pills are kicking in.  Fuck reality.  Fuck responsibility.  Fuck mirrors.  Fuck it all.    cheers you finchfuckers!  The great caveman has spoken.

      First off I would be the ruler of this apparent idealistic society of which would probably look somewhat like hobbiton from "The Fellowship of the Ring" except that their would be highways and helicopters all over the place.  We would bring in new breeds of animals that would come about with my science society which would consist of scientists handcuffed to their laboratories.  First order of business would be the half elephant half dog called the Doggyphant2000, the number 2000 would be there because that is when the doggyphant first slipped into my unconscious mindset while I was sleeping through one of my "stupid kids" high school classes which consisted of crossword puzzles as a means to teach us about English Composition.  The Doggyphant will line the borders of..........  HEY MAN SOMEONE CALLED ME!!! WHATS THAT ABOUT........ ITS MY WOMAN..... she says COME OVER HERE!! ALRIGHT FORGET IT ILL FINISH THIS CRAP LATER........  I AM LEAVING SOMEONE ELSE FINISH THIS ESSAY FOR ME.

      exercise daily, not too many crazy thoughts, takes care of the elderly, fears rejection, needs what he won't request, fears what he could be denied, scared to live, hiding in a box, like a monster locked in a cage, the key is even around his neck, the key scares him most, things could never be that simple a voice tells him, then he takes the key and unlocks the door, runs away, his contemporaries are confused, why would you want to leave a cage, they say he had too many crazy thoughts, they wrote him off and categorized him, that helped them to move on, no crying allowed, emotion is shut off, don't talk about that key around your neck

      I was in the Killeen Wal-Mart yesterday to get some boxes and shit for my move up to Denton next week. And I fucking hate Wal-Mart, especially the Killeen Wal-Mart.  Its like all the zombies from Night of the Living Dead decided that at the very moment that I needed to get something they too needed to go to Wal-Mart. Everytime I'm there I come out feeling alot better looking than when I came in.  But anyway I'm getting the shit I need and low and behold I see somebody, not just anybody but Annika Adams.  Annika Adams was the snotiest bitch I've ever known.  She was hot and she knew but she was fucking evil as sin.  Everytime I saw her my blood boiled and I wanted to hit her upside the head with a shovel-but I'd probably have sex with her first, then hit her upside the head with the shovel.  But ho ho ho, not now.  When I first saw her, I didn't think it was her and there was good reason why.  This bitch looked like she'd swallowed an god damned Oldsmobile. She was massive, I mean HUGE.  Did I feel sorry for her??.... HELL NO.  Is that wrong of me???? um YES.. Do I care???? FUCK NO.  This was a sign from god man. Plain and simple.  Justice is not a wide spread ideal, I don't think it will ever really be the Justice we want or crave.  Justice is in the little things, or huge things like Annika Adams' ass.  I think thats where God does his best and finsest work.  The other day Callie and I were driving and we stopped at a Stop sign and I went before this dude even though it was his "turn". She got all uppity about and I said "Well, God will get me for it later in life."  Indeed he will.

      	I got to class in a hurry for fear of lateness, but nevertheless arrived on time. The professor will be gone for the day and the TA is busy talking about this and about what we will do for the day’s work. I have already drifted away from that by this time and have already begun typing this word document. The thoughts race through my head like bumper cars at a carnival, sometimes making interesting connections, and even emerging as new concepts all together.  Continuing to type recklessly, as I always do, I go on for some period of time when finally the TA stops over beside me and asks “Hey what are you working on?”  I say “Just taking the fleeting ideas from up here and putting them in there (pointing to my head, then to the screen) before I forget.” I think then that he was trying to say something about the day’s assignment but then trailed off with his funny sound of Slavic accent. He kept looking at what I’m writing about, and then after catching the vibe of what I was saying, he slowly and casually agreed and meandered away.     You see, I keep searching for a way to find a reason or explanation why this place has so much space, but… devoid of artistic truth. I have no excuse for us, and any other place that I might go, I would simply say that, well… Texas has no concept of what makes art any good.  Many places have a reasonable amount of public art (such as sculptures in a plaza, for example), but not only does Texas have the least public art spaces of any state in the United States, but the stuff that can be found is exceedingly boring and can only be explained as “traditional”; fucking traditional, like a sculpture of a horse running through a fountain, or some simple complacent looking human figures that give a sense of serenity. Fuck serenity. No-one here trys the limits. It always seems an attempt to project the old country lifestyle whole Texas thing. Why so many sculptures of horses fellas? Why is it? There is nothing really all that great about horses. The only reason is that people are used to seeing the horse in the fountain thing and it appeals to a traditional group of old farts, maybe because it’s nostalgic or whatever. It won’t offend anyone with by powerful content since it has been dumbed down to the stupidity of the horse that is depicted. In this whole process of taming art to the extent of a mere passive decoration, it has lost the value of any possible meaning. Am I the only one who sees this. Am I wrong? Then why not do something to remedy this. Here I swim, trapped in the wake of a big boat passing by called “TEXAS”. Within our great state, the prevailing mantra is one of efficiency and comfortability.  Art, real art, blatantly refuses both of these.  It’s kicking against the pricks, and going against the grain of the wood that people in Texas generally think and live in.  In this way the society is allowed to pass off art as innecessary since most would feel it’s a waste of valuable tax dollars to invest in such a frivolous thing as art.  Maybe it is.  Maybe goodness itself would be a waste of valuable tax dollars.  Maybe people should stop having dreams since it “wastes” time.  Perhaps humanity should actualize an existence that embodies the definition of “bland”, “blah”, and “hollowness”.     You might think that in an advanced place as the United States and Texas that there would be a forward progression of the nature of our artwork production. There are good artists and artistic thinkers out there, ( I personally know a lot of them, whom I appreciate as diamonds in the rough) but we are muddled underneath the muck of all that Texan type of theme, which is approached in such a mundane and classic way that it can hardly be called art at all. I want to take a picture of this thing that the Grand Prairie Art Society put up at the library for a display art type of thing (shit, I don’t even know what to call it). It’s hideous, and it’s … dammit, its ridiculous.  I will post the photo later.  Silky suggests that I should join the group of Grand Prairie artists, but nobody understands. That group does not represent what I represent. Well, yes, I would surely like to have my work posted up in local businesses too, maybe sell something, but I don’t feel that my things would fit in with the colors of the décor. The type of things that I would create are not the type of thing that people will be comfortable looking at when they are at the bank or whatever.   Picasso said “I make the painting for the painting.” He also said “Painting is not done to decorate apartments.”  We should listen to the words of that man.  Fuck your flowery motifs.  Texas’ I took this form the Thomas Kinkade website: “Even people who have never had much of an interest in art before find themselves captivated by Thomas Kinkade's wonderfully warm and inviting visions of quaint, cozy cottages…” Exactly, the thing that really urks me the most: “cozy” art. So many people don’t have any underlying genuine relationship with art, but they just like whatever is pretty. This was taken from an article about the artist: "I think the appeal of his work lies in its simplicity," says Villanova psychiatrist Harvey Horowitz. "Its sentimentality resonates with people in the way a Hallmark card does." Horowitz cautions that while Kinkade's work seems to make people happy, it lacks weight and richness."  Sorry, Thomas, you and your painting company can sell your prints all to hell. If you want to read the article, it’s a very good statement made against the idea of marketing and “brand-name”, “paint by number” bullshit. http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/09.06.01/cover/kinkade-0136.html (This article will tell you a lot about art.)   This is all what I might call “complacency art”, or “serenity art” –the type of thing that hangs over the mantle with a big frilly gold frame.  Most real art is not going to need a frame, much less a big gaudy gold one that does more that to distract from the painting itself than anything else. The whole big gold frame thing just needs to be done away with. It seems that so many of the people would simply prefer to carry on an existence of… non-existence –taming art until worthlessness or disregarding it all together is more efficient and easier for most than facing it. It is better to have art that is just a pretty picture. Right? That is the underlying reason in Texas for the lack of good art in public spaces. A couple of things to note here:  I do recognize and admit that there are many individuals who are great art-lovers and art patrons, and I would not dismiss those as if they didn’t exist in this state. Also, I do not mean so much to settle on bashing Texas as the only state or place that has a shortsidedness in regards to art. Essentially, it is just that I live here, and therefore cannot help but be acutely aware of it on a daily basis. It surrounds me.   The point is, rather, that the general and vast majority are in a casual preference of not having an understanding with art. I don’t even think that they are aware of the fact. You see, art faces a person and forces them to reckon with it in some manner or another. You see it, therefore you must form an opinion, think it through, or take a viewpoint. Even, if it is just for a moment. The work is a thought, it’s a question, it’s a vision, an emotion, it’s a spark that is supposed to incite –all or any of the above.  It doesn’t need to be in a museum. In fact it would be better had it not been. The presence of a good piece of art should create some feeling of sensitivity to it, and the viewer will in some way react to it, with their mind and senses, even of it is so simple a reaction as looking away.  In addition, art in general serves no mathematically functioning purpose.  Instead, it serves to enrich the value of life (which somehow either goes unnoticed, or us folks down hur’ from dees parts just don’t give a rats can about dat’ type of thang.)  So… the value of art lies in a certain quality, my friend, and quality should not be replaced for… efficiency, or the quiet peace of non-thought.   	Picasso, quoted above is most famous for what is called cubism. I might be the first person to tell you this, but although it is commonly approved that he began this method of painting, this is not true. Another painter less known, by the name of Georges Braque, was the first to paint cubistically. The two were living close in the same area, and as both were artists, they were friends and would frequent each other’s house/shop to see the other’s recent works and whatnot. One day, Picasso stopped by Georges’ place and saw something he found very interesting when Georges shared his newest paintings and concepts. By the end of the day, Picasso was painting in this new style as well as its originator. Further along, the two of them worked together on cubism and so then happened the rest of the story.  Just like this scenario, with our famous painter, the rest of art, all the same in a like sense, is a fraud. This statement must sound like blasphemy to a hardcore art-lover. The truth is that an artist is attempting to push farther the limits of their technique and skills, and most importantly, they strive (or at least I believe they should strive) to advance the cause of the creative process by doing something as of yet undone. To bring something totally out of themself that is new and try it. Honestly though, this is not really a feasable ideal.  It is the highest goal, I think, but I don’t see it as attainable, so it’s like the whole point is flawed, like it’s a sham… right?  And if a process like this is doomed to failure, then why not abort it all together…? If that were the case, then what good is medical science? They don’t actually attempt to make people live on indefinitely, but rather try for the best quality of life that is possible. That is the attainable ideal, and likewise for the art.  For the true artist, the art is almost like a part of his health.  It is as much a reason for living as any medical operation could justify. The artist is not an impenetrable and complete self-contained entity though. S/he always draws on his experiences in the world and memory, not to mention culture, and also borrows from the lessons of history, etc. as we all do. S/he will always have a part of himself that is stuck in the regurgitation of the already familiar (I suppose to not have this would be a chaos result… if everything that a person did was completely new and inventive all of the time).  In this sense, no person could really be credited with having created something truly and completely unique, since they owe their experiences and history to time and culture and all of that; moreover... they owe any resources as a media to mother earth, or to God, or technology, or whatever. All these things considered, I still retort that, in my own opinion, it is the truest thing that I can grasp as our human reach allows, and I still claim that I can be creative. In final thoughts…we should embrace a creative spirit in our lives and lifestyles. As humans, we are best as creative beings, not robots, not slaves of the scientific systematic structure. Whatever things we do, let us not be condensed into the packaging of society’s liking. Strike up that random conversation. Live outrageously. If you bump into a person, take time to realize that it happened, to realize that time is creating moments in time that will fit into the memories that are created as we live and do things in time –and all this so that the lives we live can have value in our minds. A quasi-relationship is created during that moment between you and that stranger as you meet, and the slight memories in your minds come into existence.  The fact that the occurrence was underwent is created. The lives we live are assimilations of creative experiences, experiences that compose our lives, and in this way our lives and relationships to people and things are a creative composition. I say embrace this and enhance your enjoyment of it all for whatever you can get out of it. Those of us who know why suburbia is so drab and constricting must be in a position to think and be people… creatively.  After all, living is at its core, a creative process itself.

      as some of you may know, i don't seem to dream very often.  interestingly, whenever i do, there's always something very sexual involved.  there was a lot more that happened in the dream (either in action or in thought) than i can consciously remember.  the dream is all pretty vague and hazy now as i try to recollect it, since its been several hours from the time i woke up today (1:30, go figure). it entailed meeting up w/ this high school chick i know and we started messin around.  i think we were at her house.  then all of sudden we were at the lake on a boat with a bunch of her high school friends.  it was cool and we were having a good time, and then we were in the water and she was giving me a blow job.  i   think   we were just about to fuck when i woke up (again, just like the last sexual dream i had) with a raging boner.  the last time i had a sexual dream was a few weeks ago where i was at work waiting on these 3 different tables, which just so happened to have nothing but HOTT chicks at them.  i was getting drinks or salad and bread or food and shit for the tables, when all of a sudden i was sitting at one of the tables in one of the chicks' seats.  i didn't know how i got there or why, when all of a sudden i realized the chick who's seat i was in, was under the table giving me a blow job.  it was wonderful and marvelous, and then all of a sudden i was at another one of the tables, having the exact same thing happen.  i thought this is the most awesome day of work waiting tables i could ever have and that it could never get any better.  when again, all of a sudden, i was at the other table, getting a blow job once again by one of the hott ass chicks from that table.  needless to say, i was of course in ecstasy.  that last one finished me off and then i woke up (with a raging boner), which set me off with a great beginning to a typical, boring, stupid day serving people that don't appreciate good service.  the end.

      Alright so we got some people on this rock and this rock rolls around this bright star and the rock is blue from all this ocean and then in five billion miles in every direction there is dead space and then on this blue rock some people live and they all go crazy everyday of their lives.  Or is it this way?  Who said the earth was round?  What kind of psychopath would claim such an absurd thing?  Well my informed opinion on all of these matters is who cares.  I DONT!  Now on to some more formal business.  As I am in constant contact with my fellow man I have come across two very different and equally mind boggling individuals.  The first that I will tell about I call quite simply "the Blob" because thats what he is.  The second is a girl that I met who I refer to as "Helpy".  Now the first story is about "the blob" and he is a vile wretched beast that I dont know how I ever even came across but he is destructive in every manner and most all mankind thinks this guy is an absolute idiot, even those who I could easily reference to as idiots would consider this guy an idiot.  Another good name for him would be "the idiot's idiot".  Anyways this blob is the epitamy of wasted potential and squandered goods and the mere thought of him is enough to make me want to roll over and vomit while questioning the very essence of mankind.  Now on to Helpy, I was on a bench swing and I saw this girl and I said hey come swing and so we swung and helpy told me she wanted to help high school kids and she wants to keep them from killing themselves because high school sucks, and I thought what a helpful person.  SO THEN THE IDEA HIT ME!! SHE WILL BE REMEMBERED AS HELPY!  AS THE HELPER!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  where did eisfodspgkfgtripoi!!!!! ARRRGSHGRHG

      We were on the way back from Houston... and we were blowed. Traveling one of the many long and dead-ass stretches of road that we have so often traveled which connect places of no interest whatsoever, except for a few cities which would come forthe like an oasis in the desert of Ppo-Ddunk. In this particular instance of time, the three of us were somewhere just outside of Cameron, when Daniel began whimpering something about how Josh was driving too slowly, this is boring, and some other things as well. Personally, I was confused since the proper speed limit posted only a cool, clean 65 miles per hour, while we were well over that limit at probably 85 or so. As Silky was driving, he as well seemed to be stunned by Daniel's ridiculuous remarks. To this, Josh, and myself as well rose up in a defense, and reprimanded Daniel that he made no sense whatsoever/that he should quit complaining/and that we were going too fast already for three suspicious, stoned young people traveling through small towns and open countrysides that generally have Bastard Cops. So then, Daniel, I noticed, was once again staring out the window at nothingness in utter bliss, (or maybe he was just sulking a big pout)... I wasn't exactly sure, but then, at that exact moment, my interest came to enlightenment when Big Sexy calmly blurts out with sincere voice and a straight look in his eyes..."At least we're moving faster than that train over there." ¿!The fuck!? What does he mean by this? There's no train there, man. "What train?", I ask. Could this be his way of making some type of sarcastic remark about our speed...?(Since there is no train moving by, could he be saying that we too are not moving?) No!, that doesn't make sense. -Although there are train tracks parallel to this highway, the train does not exist, moving or not. Josh and I are dumbfounded, but atleast the two of us, unlike Daniel, can still percieve the reality of what it is around us. We automatically fired a small barrage of questions to destroy his hopes of coherence. So as it finally dawned on him (like a ton of shit) that his comment was a preposterous one, naturally, he tried to play it off like it was only a joke in passing or something of the like. That was hopeless... Silky, nor WhiteChocolate were fooled by this effort. We weren't that fucked up and we knew he had meant that seriously, but have never been able to prove it since the true fact only exists in Big Sexy's mind. Many times it has occurred to me (and I'm sure to Silkychencho as well) that I should ask about this day again, and find out what was Daniel really thinking. Each time, That Voice tells me "No". I think we all realize that it is only one of the many small parts of history that gets acted out in its time and nothing more. It changes to the form of a memory, an almost mythylogical story, an individual portion which becomes woven into the fabric of the epic tale of our lives, and at that point, it is far better left untouched.

      I, Slim, do hereby post the first ever message upon this so called blog, and I ask my fellow members who were unfortunate enough to suffer this terrible disease called awareness, aka. whining, to join in this blog.  For now that new forms of communication have made themselves available to us we can now stay in touch, rant about life or the lack of, and make fun of each other for being complete fucking failures.

      Ok fellas.  Its 3 in the morning and I'm awake for no real reason other than the fact that there is some part of me that believes that I have to be awake for a certain amount of time before i can go to sleep.  So i'm watching "shock video: on HBO.  They should just call it Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition.  I saw this dude eat a snake's head.. WHILE IT WAS ALIVE!!  I saw 3 dudes get their balls waxed oh and last but not least i saw a this rock band that consisted of 5 lesbian chicks who played naked live.  Their final act was some song where at the end the lead singer pulls her tampon out, I SHIT YOU NOT, and she stuck the mother fucker in her mouth.  WHY? Mind you the whole time i'm watching this stuff i was thinking"you know i bet if i gave daniel 50 bucks he'd do about 90 % of these things"  The more you know, the more you DON"T know.

      After reading WC's most recent and soul-searching post, I feel compelled to respond.  The only problem is that my eloquence only works when making fun of the fat, ugly, stupid, mentally disabled, negro, chinese, korean, mexican, etc.... So at least I know that I can do that.... But anyway, Jeff, I have no clue what to say to you about God. Thats why we have Daniel around. I defer to his ass all the real thinking.  I will say this, you can be skeptical of creation, of nature, of terrible things happening in this world and all the bullshit that inhabits this earth.  Thats a good thing because you are at least thinking, the first step to true confusion.  I can't really make a good arguement about the validity of God in this world but I can make an arguement about us, WKK.  I refuse to believe that we 4, and the honorary members, just happened to stumble upon each other.  There had to be something at work that brought us together, and i think it was God.  With all this shit in this world, it is a comfort to know, at least to me, that we have each other and I thank God everyday for the WKK.  Thats my two cents.  Slim

      Dan, you are my nilla, and if those words that you wrote had miraculously shone through some clouds one afternoon, then i would not doubt that God was real and then with that I would have a solid way of understanding what to believe in. Maybe that's it, God should retire and set up Daniel as his successor. I mean look at everything.. If God is supposed to bve in control, then why do we&nbsp;worry&nbsp;over the responsibility of things like air pollution from cars, since after all it must be understood that the automobile was a part of this big Godplan that is underway since the other end of eternity and therefore humanity is once again best depicted as strapped each person in their little pods of reality and conscousness hopelessly along for the ride on this big thing that htey basically have no real influence over. God as the creator of all things has the responsibility of this world firmly rested on his shoulders, God is in control right?. If we truly have the choice that we believe makes us human or whatever, the seperation between god and man is that we are apparently held accountable for what wrongs we commit (lke aids and&nbsp;air pollution and family violence and pornography, and forest fires, and traffic jams) and then God is somehow not, because first, we humanity have to live in the problems this earth whereas God does not, and also the hell to face for our wastfulness and other bad things that we do . But God as the creator of all things still is not at any part of fault in all these terrible things like AIDS and drunk driving accidents, and bad music. Those they would say are mans' creations, or the influence of the devil. (Personally, I suppose that I don't really know what to think about God but I surley don't believe in a devil with little horns and all that shit, like God's adversary and whatnot. If there is one god then I dont see how that leaves room for a devil.)&nbsp; But that doiesn't make sense... Is it Henry Ford's fault for exlample, all of the automobile air pollution to date, is it each and every person who drives a car to work each day, is it the corporate wealth hogs that only search dollars and cents from the pockets of ignorant masses, is it the government's fault? God? What are you doin'? Did you do this? Did we do this? When are you gonna reconcile all this shit? More than anything else, what is the damned point? No-one can tell me that these types of questions don't have any credibility. They might be bnasty to think about and pessimistic and they might not be typed fluently with nice words and in a way that makes eloqwuent sense, but the underlying thoughts here are of the type that a thinnking conscious being, I think, must reckon with at some point. Eventually, you get around to questions like ... Am I responsible for who I am God? And if there is a God, then let him vaporize these terrrbile thoughts and free me because I am only honestly facing them and it soon becomes a prison.

      i wrote this last night after one of my many deeply introspective moments...  i do not profess to understand what it means to be human in the whole, collective sense.  to have this body, this biology.  to be encased in this animal flesh.  and yet, to love, to hate, to forgive, to reason, to be flooded with emotions we scarcely understand as they overtake us.  to have this consciousness seems almost a curse.  to be or not to be, to be human or to not.  to feel steadfast loyalty, only to be overwhelmed by emotion after something terrible has happened which breaks that loyalty like a twig, only to be convicted the next moment and bought back to this loyalty once again.  this contradiction, this paradox, this tension which inhabits every fiber of our being, threatening to tear us apart at any given moment, acknowledged or not.  only one thing is for sure, in my experience of it; that it will come someday for each of us, unexpectedly, usually in a way we would never have imagined.  and when it does, to stare it in the face, and still, to CHOOSE faith.  this is what being human is, or more accurately, has become, for me.  to believe, in the face of any and all odds.  to trust in a God whom we cannot see or hear or taste or smell or feel.  to choose.  Faith.  to believe or not to believe, that is the question.  the answer to which will either condemn us to eternal ignorance and separation from the Source, or free us to find out what it truly means to be human.  to be fallen or to be saved.  to choose Life in the face of the death surrounding us, even within us.  to -press on- toward the redemption of our humanity; to our reconciliation to the Source, where we will finally be wholly human, children of our Living God.  to have this existential tension not necessarily balanced, but put into perspective; be resolved.  to receive this free gift of resolution.  to cry YES, in the face of death, to Life.

      All of it gets breathed in and taken into my lungs, close to my heart, but not quite.  Inside it is all somehow held together, a mysterious and pervasive puzzle, like a non-stylized assemblage art of used-up car parts from the wrecking yard.  None of which are in place for their previously functioning use, but still remain, jumbled, as a part of it it  all… individual chunks of a life.  These sculptural entities are arranged so randomly and hopelessly that when people do get a chance to really view them they say things like “Well… I just don’t know what to think of it.  What is it even supposed to be?”  It’s not just the art they’re talking about, it’s me and my reality (just one out of all these six billion on earth) since the work is my representation of it all.  Encoded with some type of unmaterialized truth, naked but undeniably present, and no-one knows how, just like the art.  I forget who it was that said this, but when asked what was the meaning of art, responded that it was to provide what life does not. All I am is just an interpreter, not even a good one. Picasso’s Guernica... Einstein’s Theory of Relativity… both ways of explaining this whole god forsaken what is.  You see, I want the everpresent dream of something else. Call me a comnplainer, I don't care, I know that I have everything that I need, But life needs more than just to have the necessity of it's continuance satisfied. There is so much that is lacking in me, and there is no rest for this abstruse mind. I'm naked in my shame drowning in today, with the hope of swimming with the aide of something imaginary.  Thoughts of Pablo Picasso: “Art is a lie that makes us realize truth.” “Everything you can imagine is real.”  “Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.”   “But language is the liquid that we’re all dissolved in. Great for solving problems after it creates them.” –Modest Mouse lyric  Beyond all the intelligent words of great authors meant to inspire poetically, beyond the science, beyond the passions of art and the philosophic versions of reality and the fleeting sensations of pleasure and pain, there is the deeper felt meaning of what life is to us.  Eventually, the words, the surety of all these other things as well fades into the pattern of the days and I find myself again right here, living but not knowing why we all float on.  That’s where dreams and imagination come in.  Kadaligogh (1:05:20 AM): with every step towards redemption i fall back as my reality explodes into a brillent prismatic vapor encompassing all misanthropic notions which coelesce into searing droplets falling from the sun bathing my flesh with a cathartic enamor numbing my emotions until all that is left is an empty copasetic hull  Kadaligogh (1:16:57 AM): that is death to me, that is what surrounds me, that fear is what drives my mind when i stare at walls. that is what is becoming of me if i don't escape  Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box  After years of waiting Nothing came As your life flashed before your eyes You realize  This continuance of things… The churning of it all,  swirls of heart and thought A life lived like a house gets dirty  With things to fix like broken dreams I should change the lightbulb in my soul  awakened from beautiful sleep from a moment more worthwile to the sound of a "hurry the fuck up" horn or the droning buzz of the alarm to start another day like yesterday Is it good enough for ya’?  life perpetuates a massing of history memories and feelings build upon each other like the shanty towns of some poor country with no apparent plan fof the future everything just runs amuck without a means of coherence  the possibililty of meaning gets lost in the clutter feels like only when I dream that my heart feels pure I suppose there is always an “eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!”    This is from Led Zeppellin:  And yesterday I saw you standing by the river,  And weren't those tears that filled your eyes,  And all the fish that lay in dirty water dying,  Had they got you hypnotized?   And yesterday I saw you kissing tiny flowers,  But all that lives is born to die.  And so I say to you that nothing really matters,  And all you do is stand and cry.   I don't know what to say about it,  When all your ears have turned away,  But now's the time to look and look again at what you see,  Is that the way it ought to stay?   Why can it be that there are more people than ever before, going on seven billion now, and more ways than ever before to be connected with those people, but that most feel more distant than ever before?  We always end up calculating things and losing joy. The inherent bodily existence I am feels like it’s sinking. Am I responsible for this?  Shit, faith and belief evaporate faster than I can replenish them.   “I still remember the world From the eyes of a child; Slowly those feelings Were clouded by what I know now. Where has my heart gone? An uneven trade for the real world. I want to go back to believing in everything  And knowing nothing at all. I still remember the sun, Always warm on my back. Somehow it seems colder now.” DanK  Time goes by carrying along the lonely wandering mind.  The ultimate annoying door to door salesman, relentless, from moment to moment, constantly soliciting his bullshit product to me. Leave me alone you bastard! I told you, I don’t want any!  I’ve already surely got enough of all your shit to last this full lifetimes worth, and what I do got’s not so damn cool anyways. It never works right, and you bitch have no warranty for the lonely wandering mind. It always falls apart and spills out sadness that become stains on this carpeted memory in my apartment-soul. Those of us who are do-it-yourselfer’s would naturally take the thing apart further in hopes of finding the way of fixing it, but that never helps, seems that it was defective from the manufacturer. Now there’s nothing left but musty memories. Don’t you have anything else for sale right now? You keep coming back again and again the same as before, and making me the same offer. Why? What’s the reason, by the way, who do you work for anyway?... since I know that it doesn’t make since for Time to operate autonomously, he should need an authorizing body of some sort that has mapped out his recurring patterns of turns to make and events to visit. What’s the bigger picture Time? And why am I in your scheme?

      Fantasticaliscious Dream  	This entire occurrence is a dream I just awoke from to be intrigued by its beauty and how interesting it all was.  It is honestly far more than I can try to write on these pages.  The parts of this that I recant here are those of the greatest importance in the dream and consequently the most clearly remembered in my memory, the vivid pinnacles of the reality on the dream as a whole.  The paragraphs here are the hinge-points of this thing in its entirety, with only the most key details that are necessary to explain this whole thing. 	Somehow, the dream-vision that I experienced was given over to me through the eyes and interpretation of some random and anonymous young woman who plays a very key role in the end of the dream.  Actually, no no, that’s not true, she does play more of a role that at the end where they discover her on the beach, when her mind is revealed to me… because in the actuality of it, half of what the dream has to offer is filtered through her understanding and memory of it and then passed on to me.  In other words, then what happened is essentially only what happened according to what she got to know.  This is more or less her story, I suppose. 	The very first thing that she has memory of upon returning to this earthly reality was the turning over and over of her body through the rotating waves of salty ocean water and the awful sound of the that water tumbling all around her.  The frightful sensation of drowning began to materialize in her conception of things and it’s a wonder she didn’t drown because she had no longer had any motor skills whatsoever.  Her mind, body and memory had been inundated completely and I suppose the crashing of the waves were a sort of extension of that.  Her transversal between the other reality and back had ruined her ability to understand things in our terms.  Her mind had been reduced to understanding things in terms of pure sensory experience without the structure that words provide and the common schemas of what we know of as rational thought.  She no longer had any vocabulary at all, so for instance, she could not recognize the waves as “waves” but only as the disorientation, wetness, shifting, drowning sensation that they gave her.  For this general reason, combined with other difficulties of expounding elements of imagination and dream, it is very difficult for me to elucidate everything since it is through her mind that I see all this, like it is through a sort of lens that is her mind which seems to naturally refract things kaleidoscopically.   	She begins to wake up but to weak to do anything about it, on a random beach like as if she were the coughed up phlegm from a shark’s cold.  Topsy turvy, she rolls in with the waves.  She still has the vision in her eyes, seeing it, but at the same time, she also now sees the new reality which she is now in.  As they overlap, she doesn’t know which one is more real and maybe can’t even distinguish them as separate.  Her eyes cannot hope to focus, for by opening them, all of the image has the hue of greenish grey and the sky looks white.  The only way that she recognized the familiarity of this world is through the sounds of voices (even though she can’t make them out as words much less are the words recognizable to her.)  The voices were those of three kids who found her promptly after she rolled in off of the open sea in her physically shredded, mentally delusioned state.  It was almost like they were there to greet her return. 	After all of this occurs where she is found unraveled on the beach, she becomes a sort of a side-show freak for scientific study of a few different sorts, but the more important fact is that someone makes a very interesting movie of the events that unfold as the strange woman arrives from nowhere of a completely unknown background.  A movie is produced telling about her and the three little kids who find her, how they try to explain to their adult counterparts what happened and how they found her that way.  I guess it was a documentary-like film since the woman was indeed sort-of an anomaly after all.  No-one knew where she came from and what could have possibly happened to her.  In all honesty though, she has just been through the most vivid experience that any human being has ever underwent.  She will never recover.  It is essentially as though she has entered another realm of reality itself, but it was entirely different than this one.  No-one ever really understood her story, and let’s just say that she was believed by many to have been abducted by a UFO.   	All of this from her visited reality will be ridiculously difficult to describe in the terms afforded me now since I have only the current vernacular to muster the re-telling.  To describe it well would tax my wits far too greatly.  The first and primary most notable thing is that there is no spoken sound of any sort and, although it wasn’t made apparent to me, I assume that neither was there any written language either.  All of the experience to be gathered in was done without the help, nor the limitations of words.  Emotional understanding overpowered logic and reason, and almost all of the sensory information was visual.  The only data not visual was what might be called “a priori” I suppose, of which things the concept of time makes a good example.  Still, even with that I have no idea how long the time in the higher reality lasted or if time really exists there, and I’m even somewhat inclined to think that it doesn’t.   	In any case, the most important part of the dream was viewed like a telescoping look through the bottom of a high ball glass.  The frame of vision was circular, and the effect was that whatever was the most valued portion of the reality from one moment to the next remained the focused element but consistently changing from frame to frame.  This important part of the dream consisted of the brother’s realization of his younger sibling’s having found the truth of existence, but that was after he was already dead (or at least at the exact moment of his death.)  His younger sibling was too young to seize possession of so great a power contained in such a concentrated form, it overwhelmed and killed him.  At least so I understand it to be.  The older brother left the devastating truth hidden for safe-keeping, and he was possibly its guardian, but I don’t know why that would be the case.  The younger brother apparently happened to uncover it (probably by accident) and found it intriguing, but he did not have the knowledge to handle this object.     	Of this much I am sure:  that the power of the unveiled truth of existence (which is only accessible in this way and in this otherworldly reality) is dangerous.  Not dangerous like radioactivity, pollution, or even a sharp knife, but there was a very obvious mystical type of danger like doom, or tribulation, or a spell, or a curse.  Like I said, this danger should have been all too obvious but the younger sibling was just too young to find himself in possession of such a thing and so his innocent death becomes one of a sort of martyrdom (for ignorance/innocence) and a tragedy (like that of all mankind).  So the truth that was discovered of the two brothers and devastated them was like a beautiful object that is perfect but all too painful for those unfortunates who encounter it. 	The older brother –they have no names since there aren’t words, finds his younger brother, as aforementioned, probably immediately upon the moment of his passing.  Now consider that when a person in our reality dies, they might typically turn pale or look weak, fall down or bleed, or just do whatever types of things that would be normally associated with dying.  This is not at all so in this other side.  Instead, death is a painfully emotional loss, but a beautiful visual spectacle.  A person’s bodily form turns to a visage of energy/light, blue in color, glowing like a soldering flame.  At the same time as this, the figure begins an ascent to a floating, yet lifeless posture, with the head glowing brightest and oriented to the sky and all things above.  The feet and legs were dangling like there was an invisible balance holding up the weight of the form from its central-most section.  The illuminated visage essentially then evaporates, and that marks the end of that particular fragment of memory.    	There is a need to make mention of the nature of the three-dimensional spaces and their attributes in this higher reality.  Even though it may not seem like anything of importance in the story, it is invaluable to express the way that the other world appeared in order to give a feeling of the quality of the experience as it was imagined in the dream.  Definitely, somehow, the spaces involved with everything were very important… maybe they could be thought of as containing a sort of holiness.  To emphasize or try to explain this fact, I will mention that as a general note, lots of the spaces and directions of things in this reality are oriented up.  A house for example like that of the brothers, if you would call it a house, was not designed with a horizontal configuration of several rooms, but instead with a truly three-dimensional promenade architecturale.  Spaces within were connected vertically, diagonally, and although there is indeed a gravitational up\down respect to things, the organization of many structural elements pays no heed to it whatsoever.  As best I can recall, all of the spaces in that reality were only interior spaces, –containments of things, and also very labyrinthical.  There were no exteriors of any things at all that I can recall.   	Light seemed to be ever-present in the higher plane of reality.  In as much as darkness would have necessitated light anyway.  Strangely, there were no light sources really, and definitely no light fixtures… still, never was there a lack of light when the nature of darkness called for the contrast.  Instead of usual light sources, each of the spaces contained elements of light and each object within those spaces embodied the hue of color present in whatever light that might have been.  The spaces around objects carried the essence of that object by an emission of its presence in color/light.  The human beings were of an amazing and powerful type of subtle light/color emanating from them as well, essentially like an aura.  In fact, it seemed almost that the energy of light was essentially the manifestation of the existence of God in the other realm.  But no-one from in the higher reality ever questioned it or was misunderstood about it, nor did they even realize that this was the case, it was inherently understood.  They were simply aware, and they knew it didn’t need their approval. 	Not even at the point at which the brother sees his sibling transmuted into the being of light, (which is the ultimate form), does the brother question this change or feel a fear for its perfection or of its possible imperfection.  Even though it strikes him as a horrific shock upon first sight of the scene that his brother has found the truth of reality and existence, he possesses an intimate understanding that what is happening is exactly as it should happen.  It is not really a fear that he experiences from this, but instead, more like a terrible and debilitating emotional release.  Painful indeed, but not to be feared since it is the epitome of this great reality.  The brother is simply overwhelmed emotionally, and involuntarily gives a portion of himself in the process of undergoing his part in this event. 	Now let me say a bit about the object itself that the brothers have stumbled upon.  This object is that which contains the secret to all being.  Yeah, real cool….  The object itself is like a self-fulfilling oracle.  I’m not sure how the object gets to the hands of the older brother, but in any case, he holds it in the highest regard and is protecting its crucial continuance.  I have no idea if it is fragile or solid, or of what material it is made, (perhaps it doesn’t really consist of matter…, who knows?)  I did see that the shape is ovoidal and it contains and emits light and has the appearance that there is a microscoping of the smallness of components extending within it until infinity.  A microcosm of elements rotate, while swirling, somehow in a pattern, while changing.  It lacks color consistency, and I mean that in two contrastable ways:  First, it never has a consistent color in any given part but instead seems to have all colors utilized throughout, and secondly, it has an indescribable fragmented and multi-patternized changing of colors and schemes.  Clearly, it appears to be of some completely holy origin.  As for how it works… no way, it can’t really be broken down to words like that anyway, I’m sure.  I would say that it more or less defies a description or explanation of function. 	There is also consistently inherent in the dream the representation of the power of the real as infinitely more valuable than the use of mere language and what thinking in terms of language can embody.  The dream was also a great deal involving the ideas of transcendence and transvaluation, and these themes are obvious to me in many tiny aspects of the dream’s trek from beginning to end, especially in the example of the representation of the glory of death.  Another concept is that of a true and complete connection between two beings as was exemplified as a vital component of the relationship between the brothers.  While in the dream, it was clear that they were almost viewable as the same person, but just that they were arriving at two separate and different stages at the same critical point in time so that the smaller was still too young for the encounter that befell him.   	The whole story had a message of freedom from the overuse of words and the meaninglessness of words and useless/false information, while it held the free mind for imagination on a pinnacle of significance.  Visual beauty replaced function as useful/purposeful.  Other illogical and interesting concepts as well were peppered throughout the stories and their connectedness.  The highest reality was the one with no language at all and had the most beautiful and real representation of things.  The woman that crossed the divide will never speak again, and the kids on the beach, in all of their innocence, had absolutely no way of conversational exchange with the helplessly beached young woman.  Those kids’ own unique dialect of Creole Spanish showed some originality on their part, and somehow they represented some sort of hope since they knew that what the rest of what people said about the young woman was untrue.  They saw firsthand her condition as she was found at the shore, and realized that something had really happened.  They, in other words, in their own childlike ways, understood more that anyone else in this reality.  	Another very interesting thing is the multiple meanings that the same basic events meant for the different groups and the multiple character viewpoints taken, as well as other layering of things.  This dream transversed more different thought patterns of character types than other dreams that I have had.  First of all, there is me, the dreamer who receives the vision of this woman’s journey of the mind somehow telepathically in sleep.  I also see the beach portion of the dream in the eyes of the three kids as they find and are inspecting this scraggely woman just drifted in from the sea and dumped onto the beach (although I don’t receive any of their thoughts though, as I do hers, like how she reveals to me of the older brother’s innermost feelings of experience with the Ovoid).  I see the scene of the children on the beach with eyes but without the insight of the thought process and mind of any one of the characters involved, but instead maybe simply through one of the children’s viewpoints.  Some other of these things are from strange ground-level angles of view, empty-mindedly, like as if maybe I were a bug or one of the caracoles. 	Nevertheless, there is much that I can deduce from the occurrence of the kids finding her laying there on the beach.  They knew she’s wasn’t dead, even though she lay there lifelessly, and since they speak such a strange dialect of Spanish, I don’t have a very clear idea where they could be from.  I might have even supposed that they were Portuguese had it not been from their Caribbean look (maybe they are from Belize or something like that).  They have no idea where she is from either.  In fact, they react to her as if they had never seen a white person before, all three are black Hispanics with a very coastal look to them, and they seem very poor as evident from their clothes and general demeanor.  There inquisitiveness and good thinking skills are astounding (they did save her life after all). 	I also see this whole thing finally in terms of actual reality in waking life, realizing it was a dream, and proceeding to study all the various stages and things involved.  There is the view of the older brother, a heartfelt lesson in losing someone who is so close they are like a part of you.  The younger brother only exists in the dream just for a moment before he turns to energy, therefore he doesn’t really have a view in that reality in effect, but instead, his reality rather, is the one of the Ovoid, which we will never really get to see or understand…  .  There is the reality of the girl… or realities.  Her visage of the other world, is one in which she has no interaction, but only sees as a spectator, mute and deaf.  Then she returns with the waves and the beach to this world, with a thwarted reality.  Both of her two realities each really exist on another level as well, that of my telepathic vision of it through her.  Only selected portions of her thoughts and memories were awakened passively to my consciousness in the dream, and so I don’t get the full story, only bits and pieces, although definitely not random bits and pieces, but the ones of prime importance.  In all honesty, I didn’t get the full story of any of the scenarios, but only the primary essence of what that part of the connections between the stories meant.  There was just enough to catch the essence.   	Finally, and most lowly, there is the level of reality for the viewers of the movie.  They are oblivious and have no concept of the other world reality that the young woman has been through since she is never able to tell the story (would she even want to?).  In general, she is viewed by them as a very strangely interesting case study of a person, who for whatever reason, winds up washed onto a beach and has gone utterly insane.  In this way, the viewers of the movie get the most worthless version, dumbed down to mere entertainment, devoid of anything truly inspired or meaningful.  They sit complacently in the theater facing into the screen listening to and seeing what the documentary wrongly tells them about the story that, in its true meaning, which is inadvertently veiled for them, has more importance than whatever any of them will ever accomplish in their lifetime.  The young woman has been both blessed and cursed to go to the other world, the viewers are simply the fat masses. 	So, in this way there is a clear hierarchy of levels of reality.  Beginning with the younger brother who has become one with the flow, in the infinitely higher plane, then his brother, then the girl who transverses the two worlds which effectively destroys her, then the kids, and finally the viewers to receive the emptiest understanding of all this.  Oh… right, the fact that I almost forgot myself.  I suppose I fit below the level of the girl since I am a second-person interpreter, drinking the last in the cup of her knowledge backwash.  At the same time I exist in this reality where I am writing this page of words, and not to mention, the person that you are, getting all of this story from me in this written form. 	Surely there are other things that could be expounded on a little further but I’m not entirely in faith that they could carry any further the essence of what this dream was really all about.  This dream is full of representations and incidental things having meaningful themes and iconographies that I can’t effectively explain here in this page since they are not really meant to make sense in this reality.  Surely, they would best pertain to my subjective understanding of the dream, or even moreso… they would probably make sense really only within the context of the dream itself.  The Ovoid, in the dream, for example, is what we might call the essence of all things, and its meaning is more than the meaning of life itself, although it would not need to engage in a struggle for superiority over life, but I suppose simply that it is a more concentrated form for life, therefore more meaningful.  There is no better way of explaining this, at least not that I can think of within the confines of letters and words.  I should make illustrations for this story, but they would not quite live up to the shoes that they should fill for the visual enhancement, not by a long shot.   	I’d like to think that the final message from this dream is one of faith in imagination.  Yes, in this dream is where my imagination has done it to me again… given me a strange sense of hope in an idea that isn’t real and appreciation for something immaterial and its beauty.  What is real anyway?  “He always wondered why the sensations one felt in dreams were so much more intense than anything one could experience in waking reality –why the horror was so total and the ecstasy so complete –and what was that quality that could never be recaptured afterward; the quality of what he felt when he walked down a path of tangled green leaves in a dream, in an air full of expectation, of causeless, utter rapture –and when he wakened he could not explain it, it had just been a path through some woods.”  Ayn Rand

      i went to coth, and some kids were askin about yall (SilkyChencho and Daniel).  There is a limited supply of eccentrics out at camp which is a bit odd but not totally out of the ordinary, basically its just me and davin haley so as a way to see if there were any other fans of the obtuse we decided to make a play at talent show.  Some kids chris rodriguez, poncho, robert washington, and fly told me and dav that we were the only ones who really "know how it is" so they asked us to slap a play together.  And we did.  I wrote it and we rehearsed, davin played a bum, i was a minister, and the campers played some thugz who i convert.  So the kids jump davin, I teach them to Love humanity like Jesus did, then they decide to get davin the bum a job at wendy's, then I come out and see the fruit's of my labor coming true.  Then the surprise twist as me and dav intended we get the song karma police by radiohead to start playing at what would seem to be the end of the skit, we then proceed to dance to this near undancable song, to the confused look of counselors and surprised laughter of a few select campers.

      Thats it.  I can't take it anymore.  I'm getting my ass a blue suit.  I mean, why not?  I've already got a black suit with a waistcoat and shit and I feel sexy as hell in it,  but I usually feel sexy as hell.......  Maybe I'll get like 20 of them like Andy Griffith had on Matlock,except his were grey, and wear a blue suit everyday.  Shit if it works for the Caveman it should work for my ass.  A Blue Suit.  Ah I can just see it.  I'd look like the the chick from Willy Wonka who expanded and had to be deflated, but at least I'd look good in my suit.    Played poker last night which was exhilirating to say the least.  I love playing poker for nothing.  Its basically a microcosm of the life of a White Knigga.  All this "strategery", bluffing and bullshitting and in the end you don't win or lose, just complain.  Complaing is an art form and we are all the Da Vinci's of our day.  But at least we only complain to each other.  But in reality I can't complain about anything but that doesn't stop me from doing so. I've got great friends, a great family, a nice place to live, i've been blessed by God with talent and enough intelligence to get by, I don't have to worry about food or money, I don't shit on myself, I can remember my name and I've got plenty of lead in the old pencil.  Life is Good.   But........

      4 sets of 8 with 315 on squats today...put that shit UP!  I don't know how to feel today.  I've recently had the heaven of looking into the eyes of the love of my life, an experience that has never ceased to consume me for the past 9 years.  Unfortunately, at this point in time, I’m not the love of HER life.  I revealed feelings through tears, but I may as well have been just crying under water because she didn't notice.  Still working on that though.  She will be mine.  Oh yes.  She will be mine.  It’s a fearful reality in itself.  I feel like my heart has been emptied into a bottle and desperately thrown out into the sea like one of those salivating fucktards would do who is trapped on a deserted island.  I don’t know where it’s gonna go from here, and there’s no telling who it is that might find it.  Where the hell do those guys get that stuff from anyway?  You’ll see them in movies...  They’re on an island about the size of a Dolly Parton tit, there’s usually one tree, and there’s only sky and ocean as far as the eye can see.  But, somehow, there just happens to be a pen, some paper, a bottle and then some random junk like a handful Legos that won't piece together to make anything.  You'd have to be MacGyver to pull yourself out of that one, but somehow the fucktard always seems to make it work.    Maybe I should do that.  Write her name on my heart, put it in a bottle and just throw it out there.  If it comes back to me still with her name on it, then I’ll know I have someone special.  If not, I could always force myself into a life replent with constant meaningless sex and consistent doses of other such debaucheries.  Get laid, get drunk, get JOSHED!  But, the waves of the ocean are strong my friends.  The wretched tossing and turning could easily erase even the most permanent statements of delicate love that we could ever write on our hearts.  Scary thing is, there's no lifejacket to save us, and the salt in the water makes the wounds burn deeper as all we are is slowly eaten away.  My feelings are drained...just flooded out somewhere.  It’s like I have emotional diarrhea or something: ALL my feelings just ran out and now they sit outside my heart taking the form of a worthless puddle of runny shit.    I thought about all this as I started lifting weights today.  Fortunately, the walls at the gym are lined with mirrors, and I can admire myself and feel good about it all with every fiber of the muscles that bulge from my body.  It seems that vanity has been quite a powerful cure all drug for me this summer.  I hope that one day, the love of my life will be able to cure me of my vanity.  She will be mine.  Oh yes.  She will be mine.  If the salivating fucktard can get off the island, then surely I can win the girl.    Peace and prostitutes finchfuckers!  The great caveman has spoken.

      Beguiled by an ineffable urge to spontaneously combust at the moment (partially drawn from my recent conversation with Slim over his Johnny Cash dream), I have decided instead to bring myself to terms with this sick reality and create from my confusion and even more erratic post on this particular website.  There's no particular point to this, no underlying motif or narrative, simply an innate desire for a rediculous exit from this all too insincere play we sometimes call life.  Broken condoms, phallic monuments, archaic depositories of egyptian waste, these are all things that bother me not.  This rediculous abundance of thought that plagues a mind worn entirely too thin, that tears apart a soul with very little left to give, these are the things that drive me towards insanity.  This is the awkward tight rope I balance precariously upon throughout my daily endeavors.  To not let escape the desire to unload and tear down everyone around me.  To hold in that yearning to simply burn everything to the ground.  To start anew.  This time, to begin with a little meaning behind things.  Some form of intelligible understanding that can be communicated at an early age and thus rid the world of this plague of uncertainty.  Well, I believe that's all I have to say at the moment.  My fellow niggas, I bid you all a good day.  Coop, you must get your happy ass up here some time soon.   ~silky  Oh, and yeah, the theme of the day still remains the same, Cave Man.  Fuck Women.

      I've learned much in the past several days.  I've learned that:  -we don't choose who we fall in love with.  Our heart chooses for us, and our heart doesn't care what it does to our minds when they don't reciprocate the feeling.  -i have some friends that love me, and some friends that don't.  The ones that do, God bless them for their loyalty and their acceptance of me.  The ones that don't...well, they will not be forgotten, nor will they be missed.  If i'm not good enough for them, then why should they be good enough for me.  -i look DAMN good in my blue suit, and everyone but Alexa seems to think so as well.  She has yet to see me in it, but her mind will soon be changed, especially after she sees me "out of the suit."  ;-)  -i can have any girl i want except for the one i want.  The irony in that realization is ironic in itself.    -girls see me as empty.  I might go with josh's idea and just go gay for the time being.  At this point in my life, temporary thumbprints around my ankles sound much more appealing than eternal scars on my heart.    -i'm getting strong as shit.  For the first time in my life, i did a set of 8 on dumbbell incline with the 100 pound dumbbells...put that shit UP!!!!  -and the last thing I've learned this week, Daniel NEVER answers his freaking phone.  I actually learned that a long time ago, but just felt like mentioning it on a list of the things i've learned.  peace to you my royal finchfuckers!  The great caveman has spoken.

      But fuck writing though, what things really need to be expressed never see an ounce of liberty with words anyways.  Either its not said at all out of naught, or on the other hand, the attempt to convert to wordage is botched somehow and there is no use in either one of those two. By the way, don't listen to any of this shit, I'm warning you. This should never be viewed because its mighty shitful.. well it just shouldn't be, trust me. Actually, its good enough that it just struck me that I have nothing else that I even want to continue on typing about, so I suppose that the above applies and I will not say anything and avoid the truth of whatever that felt important. Just know that I made the choice to not say, and that's the point. What the fuck meaning could I ascribe to this shit by trying to explain it? It's just better if we keep pretending that whatever we are experiencing already has inherent meaning, right?

      I had this dream, where I was with my friend and it was my friend whos brother just died and it was weird cuz like I was back in time trying to like save everyone from dying.  It was all this amassed time travel thing, really bizarre, like I kept trying to save people from death rather than informing them that death is freedom from a cage, but in my dream it made no sense.  then I woke up wondering if anything was true if it is not accepted in your own mind, then I decided that truth exists whether you deny it or not.  Now on to reality a day or so ago I went to New Orleans and rode on this street car and I got to see these crazy people, then me and my girlfriend were walking down the street and this dude came up to my girlfriend and said "what are you frowning for? you're with the best looking guy in the city."  I had to laugh at that one just for the pure randomness of the comment.  People who talk to strangers are very commendable.  I have got this haircut now, and its very respectable looking all shortish and like 1/4 of an inch on the sides and like an inch on top and now ive been shaving my face a lot so I look like a pretty average dude which allows me interesting perspectives and indirect compliments from strange men.  Well my dearest WKK, the elusive WC who I have somehow never met, Slim an awareness victim if ever there was one, Silky the future Ralph Waldo Emerson (or Dostoyevsky or Hesse), and of course mi truest knigroe Big Sexy.  I am off to none other than the Camp of the Hills for the month of July, I have brought a ton of Film and Paper and pens and I will now proceed with my sociological analysis of inner city youth and outer city wealth, I bid you all well for this month and expect that somehow somewhere I will randomly run into you.

      This has been some hell of a week for me here in Denton.  Were in not for Jeff and Daniel I doubt I'd be in an apartment with Furniture in it.  But thats what being a White Knigga is all about my friends..... doing things for each other soley for the opportunity to make fun of their ass while they are helping you.  This weekend has been great.  Callie is here.  I've 200 cable channels, the fastest internet connection in the world, a brand new Martin guitar, and about 49% stock in Bed, Bath and Beyond.  I went in that place for the first time yesterday and I felt like Ricky Fitts looking at the plastic bag.  I never thought I'd get excited about being domesticated but it just goes to show that you fucking never know how things will go.  School starts Monday and I can't fucking wait.  I finally feel like I'm in College now.  Well time to go negros.  Josh, sorry about your woman.  There are more fish in the sea of.... fish.  Or whatever. Daniel and Jeff, thanks again and to all you other crazy niggas.....go fuck a duck.

      So, I'm dumping Danielle in what will prove to be the most trying breakup of my life.  If you think life sucks, imagine giving everything you have to give to a womane only to find she is cheating on you and feels it necessary to flaunt that in your face.  Fuck women.  I swear one day I'm just going to turn gay.  On a bit lighter note, I've just spent the last couple of hours with Big Sexy at Beto's and I'm fucking hammered.  Thus, everything's at least all right right now.  Peace, niggas.  I hope you have to never experience what I've just been through. ~silky

              I had a dream this morning that felt really powerfully moving. No, disturbing is the word. A man starred in a film that was a recording of a game show or something. The disk menu or opening credits or whatever had an image of a gunshot coming through a shattering mirrored surface rendered in blue silver tones with this face that had vibrant eyes with a painfully cold expression being blown away through the glass-like surface. The movie opens with the pan in shot of a bus that the camera follows the bus and the man is on the bus going to the studio where the show will be recorded. The camera view zooms closer and closer then passes through the roof, zooms up to the man, enters his head and the remainder of the dream is the rest of his life. He spends it all in the game show studio. The camera in his head records the whole film in a single continuous take, and there are no mistakes or cuts or scenes, or anything else.     Now the dream was mostly about the game itself and its questions which was more like a quiz show or something, and the man’s participation in it which was actually nothing but a shifting between being hopeful at the beginning of each of the questions and regretful at their end. But no-one else had anything to really give to the game either, so the game was allin all pretty lame since no one really was able to answer or play. The contestants were all fools and he was one of them, even though he didn’t feel like it, he knew he was but couldn’t leave or do anything else about it. The gameshow was set up like a classroom with stadium seating but different, and the game was a series of asking questions going around the room like playing “Round-the-World” in high school. The quiz had the most terrifying, mystifying questions and they utterly baffled all the contestants, but the man would not leave or give up on any of the answers. The coolest thing was how the gameshow all made sense and the questions that were asked even made sense but they were utterly crazy, even though I don’t remember them, they fit exactly with what the movie was about. Questions were too overpowerlingly many and too complex to describe here but he thought and thought over it all until he became an old wasted nothing right there before the camera and the movie recorded it all. It was terribly sad and frightening to see. He eventually had made a charade of himself, and remaining stumped, someone finally went to him and attacked him then shot him in the head, splattering him away. It may have been an accident, but that didn’t really matter, the show was over. The disk menu came up again and that was it, I woke up to the alarm sound that blended its way into the dream as the buzzer at the end of a question time limit.   My negroes.. that dream was followed by another one since my lazy ass went back to sleep after getting back from class. I dreamt that I was sick. I had a stomach and body aches and fever with cough and all that shit. And I swear I woke up feeling like crap, but then realized that it was just dreams, and then I thought to myself "what the fuck? Who the hell dreams that they are sick?" That's just ludicrous fellas. It honestly sucked. well..., toodles.
