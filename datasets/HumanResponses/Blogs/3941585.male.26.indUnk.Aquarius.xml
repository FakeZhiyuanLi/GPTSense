      Things were great when we were kids  We had and could make many friends  At school or family gatherings.  Things were different, not a care in the world where we would be in 20yrs.

      I had some kind of revelation or some kind of thought on xmas eve at Victors. I guess I spaced out. But I sat there seeing all the kid playing with each other, unwrapping present. All I could think of, is look all everybody has achieved with their life. All in relationships and starting familys with kids. I just feel Im in a time warp. But Im getting there...

      Tim McGraw: I Guess You Get Used To Somebody lyrics I thought I felt you touch my cheek this morning But I must've been dreaming And in the middle of the night without a warning I thought I heard you breathing Me and my so - called independence I've got this loneliness that's so relentless  I guess you get used to somebody Kinda like having them around I guess you get used to the way they make you happy Bring you up when you're feeling down I never dreamed when I was letting you go that I would wake up and miss you this much I guess you get used to somebody, I guess you get used to being loved  I kinda miss those rambling conversations Where we'd talk about nothing The way you always made me laugh at my frustrations Baby that was something I should've been careful what I wished for 'Cause I've got my freedom and so much more  I guess you get used to somebody Kinda like having them around I guess you get used to the way they make you happy Bring you up when you're feeling down I never dreamed when I was letting you go that I would wake up and miss you this much I guess you get used to somebody, I guess you get used to being loved  I never dreamed when I was letting you go that I would wake up and miss you this much I guess you get used to somebody I guess you get used to being loved  I guess you get used to somebody I guess you get used to being loved

      Free Floating thoughts.......  Why does it seem I don't hear from anybody anymore? Where has everybody gone? Granted they are no longer single like me, involved in relationships or married and busy raising children. But are they that busy that can't call or stop by at all? I know I'm the one with more time..... But that doesn't solve my feelings. What transgressed?  How can I make things better? What has transgressed? I wish I could see my little cousins more often, and be part of their life. How do I express this to them so they would understand? I need that closeness. I may not ever have my own family, and the closest thing to feeling that fulfillment, is my cousins. My siblings they are like...  My birthdays approaching, but I still got on my mind how I would like it if somebody would give me a silver Celtic/or crucifix cross pendant necklace. I've got numerous I've boughten and I still haven't found what wanted. and I figured it out. For a cross to be special, it most be given from somebody near &amp; dear to me.  The only person that converses with me is Catrina. I don't know what happened to Randi, she used to converse with me, now it’s like I’m a stranger. People do get busy, that I understand. But I don't want to be forgotten, like a Grandparent that family feeling uncomfortable around &amp; avoids conversation with...  I know children say silly things, because they mis-interpt things us adults know/say. But I can't help but wonder why Cailet cries when she’s near me. I know she cries at others equally. And when Kimberly was younger, she would run from me &amp; cry. And just a couple weeks ago, Kimberly was kissing everybody goodbye, she walked passed me saying “I don't want to kiss Cody” That just crushed me... What is it she thinks? This now makes me wonder, do adults subconciencly feel that same repressed thought. Yes, I'm different looking. I to feared people like myself when I was little, when I saw disabled people in the store.  This week at school, a continuing trend, people talk to my mom instead of me, like I'm not there. I mean like classmates, come to my mom and ask her things they could have asked me. Or the instructor explains a paper or test schedule to my mom.  Anyhow, that’s a wrap...

      I've heard allot of people in similar situations, i.e. disabled like me. That explain similar instances where friends they knew don't come around . And even where family members don't come around. What is this anomaly? That is a difference between single people and Married people. Thats understable. But I just hope I'm not one of those "instances" .  I often wonder what it be like if I had a brother or sister. But the grass is always greener on the other side.

      I think lately, last few years. First time ever in my life, I've been lonely. I feel as though a part of me empty, a void. It's not a once in awhile feeling, it is always there. I've just let it overwelm me, I deal. At times it even hurts.. I keep trying to find a way to fill that void.  I keep wanting to spend quality time with my family, a.k.a cousins, and litt'l ones.  My cousins and my family are what make me, without them, I do not know where I would be. They mean the world to me. My cousins are like my sisters Thats why it hurts me, I don't get to spend much time with them. I know Im just a cousin, not a sibling.. I often wonder why people don't call me on the phone, just to say hi and see how things are. I know I try to call them. But not everybody is not in to chit chat on the phone.  I just need to know that theres somebody out there.
