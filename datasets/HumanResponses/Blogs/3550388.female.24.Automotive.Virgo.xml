      Well what can I say except what a weekend.  Friday started off alright but by the time I arrived home...crickey it had been eventful.  They say you learn something new everyday and on Friday the one thing that I learnt was that medication and alcohol do not mix.  I ended up being so messy that I got my self and two friends kick out of a bar....Then my two friends had to carry me home and in the process my jeans got a little bit ripped.  I don't remember much after that.  But apparently I was worst for wares.  Just how far down the spiral I actually was came out and to tell you the truth it is scaring me.  Why is it scaring me cause a few other friends have really seen that side of me and what I normally find is that not tooo much longer after they no longer there gone in the back ground.  They have a tendencies to leave.  I think that is why I don't tell many people how I am really feeling.  I keep it all hidden cause once they know the real me they will gone.  Many a times this has happened to me that's why there is such a huge wall around me.  Saturday morning was painful.  Both physically and mentally.  The ugly hangover symptoms yuck!!!!!! Took me all day to recover from.  But mentally I took a step back.  That little girl that was so close to coming out 24 hours earlier had taken a few steps back.  She was starting to walk freely but Friday night scared her and as a result is back to where she was found.  In a dark corner holding her knees.  I could kick my self.  I had worked hard to get her to come out but I just sent her back.  Looks like it will be back to the drawing board.    Time for bed but I have so much more in my mind to dump that I will think about it some more to night and get back to you tomorrow.

      I have been meaning to visit back here and do a mind dump but lately have been busy and too lazy.  I was just reading the last post and I must have been in a foul mood cause where I am sitting it is not that bad.  I mean I still do the shit kicking stuff but I am slowly starting to believe in this product (especially if a few changes/improvements are made to it). (just a note...my head starts thinking one thing and then it goes somewhere else so please bare with me)  During a meeting today we were discussing HDTV and SDTV.  Some one was explaining the difference of the two and how they work and what makes them different etc.  I was so excited about it, it really wasn't funny.  It just made me realise that I really like finding out about new technologies.  I think that is why I decided to do a IT degree in the first place.  I like finding out how things work and why they work.  During this meeting I felt like I was exploring new territory and it felt absolutely amazing.  I felt as though my brain was actually working.  Thinking about it now....makes me realise that my brain is getting fat......it's not doing any exercise.  Don't get me wrong I do use my brain but I don't think I am using it to it's full capabilities.  I am intelligent and reviewing what I do here at work makes me want to go out there and find a job where I actually use my intelligence a little bit more.  I don't use the full power of my brain here at work.  Crickey, the therapy is paying off :)    I must admit though that I am sort of starting to use my brain by attempting to read a little bit more.  That has been interesting the only problem being that I read 5 pages and then I go sleep.  But at least I am trying.  Today is therapy day.  Have been going to therapy for about 2 months now and it has done me a world of good.  The weight that has been pulling me down for years now is slowly gram by gram coming off.  The original start to this blog was...change is good....it's hard but it's good.  Then I was going to ramble off about changing your diet and how hard it is at first.  I believe that Therapy is changing your mind and it is hard.  I suppose a therapist is like a dietician.  They teach you the good and bad things for your body. How to exercise and stuff like that.  They retrain your eating habits.  In my mind that is what therapist does except they retrain your brain.  In a good way that is.  For many years, I have learnt to deal with things by myself.  Tried many a times to share but just found it too hard.  Ah anyway tooooo heavy these things are meant to be light and uplifting, perky.  Work tomorrow is looking like a flop.  Someone is leaving and as a result it will be a huge messy lunch.  Don't know if I really want to go cause I don't really get on with the people at work.  I just feel out of place. I feel like I stick out like a sore thumb.  Gotta cut this one short.......therapy calls...  By crickey what a session.  It is funny how one minute it can be good and then wham the bad feelings hit you like a freight train.  This session knocked me flat on my arse.  It was really weird actually.   We had been discussing a whole heap of good things that had been happening and then wham it turned.  We were discussing the child and the adult and was like a real out of body experience.  It was not funny.  I could actually see/feel the child within me.  It was scared to come out but it did a little.  Me the adult was trying to comfort this little girl who for so long had been hiding all alone.  it as like getting a scared animal to come and get a piece of food.  I was physically patting my head to comfort myself.... It was totally weird...I can now see the little girl sitting in the corner of the room with her knees bend and her arms wrapped around them.  Covering her face and I was doing during my session.  It was quite moving.  I could see her.  With the patting of her head slowly slowly she walked over to this person who was holding out her arms to her.  But the littl girl was scared.  Scared of what....not sure but she was scared.  The weekend has finally landed.........so I better go and enjoy it........

      Well this is my first ever post. And I find it very hard to start.  As I fell very boring.  I don't have any major interests like my friends do so it is very hard.  But after some convincing from a friend of mine I am going to use this basically as a mind dump.  So here it goes.  It's hard.  Now that I have decided to record stuff I don't know where to start.  Let's just give a little background information about my self.  I am in my mid 20's and currently living out of home for the first time.  Moved at with my then boyfriend.  But now due to circumstances caused by me we are no longer BF GF.  So currently we are good friends.  Gotta love him.  One of the sweetest guys I have ever meet.  It is really funny cause if I was him I would have left me ages agao.  But no he has been really good and been there to help me through a very trying and difficult time.  I am very greatful for that.  He has a heart of gold and I love him dearly.  He is my best friend even thought sometimes I find it hard to communicate with him but slowly we are learning,  I come from a nice good Italian family.  five kids - 2 elder brothers and 2 elder sisters.  No good Italian family is complete with a disfunctional mother and father. But then again whose parents are functional.  Father is a contreter and mother is a house mum.   Schooling was a fun adventure.  Going to a catholic primary and high school and then venturing to university where I wasted three years of my life getting a degree that I currently don't use.  Big waste.  The only good think to come out of it was meeting a few good people and learning how to drink copious amounts of alcohol.    Then comes work.  Yuck!!!!!! I have been at the same company for the last three.  Started there just working three days a week and then slowly moved to five days a week.  First I was just a shit kicker doing all shitty jobs. Now three years later I am still doing those shitty jobs plus some selling.  That part at the moment I don't really like.  Selling something that you don't really believe in is really hard. Especially to the small people I deal with who really can not afford such a service.  Why do I stay?  I don't know but I use the excuse that their is space for me to move and develop more skills.  But with my cureent high confidence NOT!!!! I won't be going any where fast.  One great thing about work is the great people that I work with.  I have met some of the greatest people there.  Some of which have become the greatest friends and have helped me through some not so good times.  That's about it. Can't find anything else that is interesting to say about me at the moment.  I do enjoy sport and play quite a bit of netball with a great bunch of girls who have taught me a great deal and who I have a ball with.  They are a bunch of friends where I can totally feel comfortable with my self and don't really have to impress them.  Meaning that they don't care where or who they go with, or even how you dress.  They are just happy to have a great time.  Which is so cool cause you don't find many friends like that any more. They are cool!!!  That's really about it.  There is really nothing else!!!  But once I do find something else I will let you know....  Be Good!!!

      Oh what a night late July back 2004..Me and the notable chicks went out to the  urlLink Bristol Arms Retro Hotel ...and had a ball....they all piked and went home early but I had a ball with some other netball people that we met there and I partied till 5am......that is amazing for me cause if you know me...I hit a wall at 1ish and then it is down hill from there. But this time with a little bit of help I was able to last "all night long, all night long". I danced my big booty off...I was dancing with the girls on the podium...it was great...met a few people...for once I was out going saying hello to people we were dancing with it was good. The best time I have ever had in ages.......I also had caught up with a grea friend of mine...risa bisa...It was great to catch up with her.......we danced all night long!!!!  One thing I find when I go out is I feel extremely guilty after going out. I don't know what it is....Not that I didn't anything bad this time...I just had a ball dancing and chatting......But on the Sunday I felt as though I was a bad person cause I was drawing to much attention to myself by acting the way I was acting. I was scared to go outside for the fear that the people I would see would would be judging me on the way that I acted on Saturday. It was quite bad cause on Monday when I needed to leave the house for work I broke down in tears. That was a shock to me. Lucky for the telephone I was able to call my flatmate and he was able to reassure me that things were going to be OK. And they were. The hardest thing would have been going to netball last night but I went with no problem at all. I was a bit nervous but things went fine. The only reason they probably went fine was because the girls that I went out with didn't not play so I didn't have to face them. That's the hard thing. These "Chicks" are a couple of years older than me and I have known them since say 16. So I feel as thou they are my parents and acting the way I was my real parents wouldn't approve of the way I was acting so I thought that the "chicks" wouldn't approve either. I am in two separate mines one says who cares you had a good time......and the other says...what a disgrace, you looked stupid, you were making a fool of your self. But I know deep down inside that  I was having the time of my life . Ahhhh welcome to my head.  Lucky on Monday afternoon I was able to have my counseling session to iron out a few creases in my head. She recommended that I read a book about regression and so far it has been a good book. An eye opener. I am slowly starting to understand the way I react to certain things and situations.  Gotta go!!! Will finish later  Don't you just hate it when you don't get to finish it.........

       urlLink Dreams about Nuclear Bomb - wordIQ Dream Analysis   It was the scaryiest dream I have ever had in over three weeks.  Hopefully the only thing that is true about this interpretation is that "it could indicate that something important to you has ended and big changes are about to occur"  I am a very firm believer that big changes are in motion!!! :P

      What a week it has been. A week of revelations.    It was the week where I realised that I am finally an adult.  It was a scary thought.  It hit me like a brick wall.  Actually it rose up and hit me in the head.  Even though I am 24 years old I have felt like I was 16.  I always saw myself as the 16 year old who was treated and acted like a 16 year old.  But of late, I have been changing my thought patterns and feel in control of what I want to do, how I feel etc.  What was it that made a big chuck of concrete rise and hit me in the head.  Several things.  There was not one actual event that caused it.  It was a cluster of life changing events that forced the concrete up from it's frame work.  First, event would have been the scare of finding my dad on the couch and having to call the ambulance for him.  That was a pretty scary position that I found my self in.  Previously on Saturday, mum and I had been looking for a bed.  I had been lying on several beds testing them out.  Once one was purchased we went home and found pa on the couch in pain not being able to move had to call the ambulance and act responsible.  I had to take charge of the situation as mum was off in her own little world putting dishes away.  I suppose she thought hat if the ambulance were to come she needed to have the place a little bit clean.  It was a scary situation but I handled it ok with a few tears of course but I was fine.  Another event was chatting to my sister.  We actually had an adult conversation where we were able to discuss different adult topics.  I was able to give her some "adult advice about a situation she was in.  I felt good cause she actually took my advice seriously and had not treated it as advice from her little sister who doesn't know much.  It felt good.  It felt as though I had made a little bit of a difference.  Another event that happened was a family gathering.  I just didn't want to go and deal with people I have next to nothing in common with.  Also I didn't feel like explaining to them the story about me and Boyfriend.  So I didn't go and it felt good not to go.    Then there was Tuesday night dinner.  My flat mate and I went and did a bit of exercise we came home, I cooked some dinner and we ate it at the table over a bottle of wine discussing different things.  It was great.  It was only then that it really hit me that I am an adult....a full grown adult.  I am responsible for my own life.  I do what I want to do.  I do what makes me happy not what makes others happy.  I put myself first and foremost.  For so many years I was always trying to make others happy even if it did put me out.  I remember going to like 5 different events on one night.  The only reason why I was doing that was to make everyone happy even though I couldn't really enjoy any of the events as I was only there for a short time.  I ended up driving most of the night from one end of Sydney to the other end.  It was amazing.  I used to feel bad for not at least attempting to go to the events.  So to make me not feel this way I went to all the events.  Even though I didn't want to go.  Well no more!!    It has been a big learning curve for me.  Especially with the "putting ME first".   For the first time in a long time I feel as though I control my destiny.  I can't wait around making others happy I first gotta be happy within before I can be happy with others.    I am starting to discover things I like an things I want to do.  Looking at doing an art appreciation course and maybe doing some creative work.  Starting to read more.  Basically having to find myself.  What I like (music wise check this out urlLink ..:: scissorsister::.. ), what I don't.  Re-evaluate everything.  Get moving on my dream of owning a cafe/restaurant.  Get fit again.  Buy clothes. Save. Learn.  Like they say the world is your oyster and I am going to discover it.
