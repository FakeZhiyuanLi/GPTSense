      hmm, since I will probally write in this alot I should introduce members of my life to you.. since I will probally get yelled at if I don't code name their names I'll go through and do this first..  to start out with as everyone always does I will start with the most important person to me,  my love he makes mornings worth waking to, and the day worth living.. he makes me smile when I feel like I could cry and makes me laugh when I feel like I could die.   To start out this I'll  introduce you to V .. since it's his nick name already it works.  He is probally the person that I will write about the most he causes me to feel so much, and is an extremely important part of my life. He is my light to the dark. I think without him, my life would be more dead, and I'd not understand what love is. I'd also would of missed out on someone so great, life would of lost it's point.  Next, Steel, God, I'd be lost and dead without him, he is my sanity. .I should calll him that sanity lol.. anyway my sanity  does near anything to make me happy..  I guess if I never met V and my life was different I would probally of started this blog out introducing to you my sanity instead of my V. But the case is I love my V more then Sanity lol and so Sanity never will have a chance but I will always try to be there for him, cause he is always there for me.  Hmm, then it's gonna be Dream, Dream is like the sister that has weak points, like today, my cause for my blog, but She is more strong then she thinks.. Her life has sucked UBER SUCKED and yet she's still here. I think of her as a sister sometimes and a mom others..  She is wise and so great at helping me out when I royally mess up.. I know now adays I will probally have to cheer her up more then before but if it keeps her here then it is worth it one day I know she will bee happy again and will be Dream. But untill then I will be here for her.  Now for someone offline, Rival . My lil cousin well my lil sister that is really my cousin. She is smart and brave, and speaks her mind reguardless the hell she will cause. Sometimes we clash and are in big arguement but we always just laugh it off and go on talking about things. I think if there was anyone that she'd be like it'd be Yami and I'd be Seto.. because.. she ... is uhhm younger then me has two sides and is generous to peoplenot to mention can beat me at near everything I try, and I would be Seto because I am just arrogant enough tobe.. though we are more friends then enemys. She is always my Rival.   hmm, Next should Be Big sis Faith but we'll call her just Faith. She is the reason I am how I am,, the reason I am who I am. she is extremely smarter and braver then I ever will be, I am only smarter then her. Though online we fight hell of alot we hardly ever fight anywhere else.   Then will be Nina or Mum, She really is like my mom online she watches out for me, she tells me good advice she even calls me child ^o^ .  Next J/2 my online dad, Dad is like the dad I never had growing up he's strong caring and watches out for me, he thinks I'm really great and smart and kool.. I am proud to have him and Mum as my online parents ^o^.  Finally my Uncle  and Aunt.. for them they will be  well uncle and aunt lol ..  My uncle is the closest I have had for a father growing up he takes care of me and helped raise me, He is my godfather, Mother made a great choice choosing him, He is also Rivals dad.. Which means I go over his house alot to hang with Rival and him.   Next would be my Aunt, she is like the kind of mom I had growing up.. my real  mom was a push over .. and she let me get away with alot and I love her alot but she always had work she makes up for it now adays but when she wasn't there my aunt was she took great care of me, she helped raise me taught me wrong and right, and that men are evil lol and how to eat without making a complete mess of myself.  She also supports my writing.  I think that will do for now..  I will introduce myself in the next entree.
