       urlLink    A special congratulations going out to my brother Anders! Here he last night after his starring role in the improvisational comedy, "Dumb Luck." We're all so proud of him. And I just love that he's looking all princely in this picture, when in fact, he was a frog up until the last few moments of the play!  urlLink

      I'm a big fan of Tiki type art. There's just something so great about the retro style of Tiki. I love the art of  urlLink Shag . And  urlLink Luc Latulippe  has a great new piece too. Even my good friend  urlLink Bryan  has created some excellent Tiki illustrations. So I was delighted tonight when I discovered  urlLink 3rdMARTINI.com , and designer Jeremy Fuksa's  urlLink Tiki Bar  credits. The music is catchy and it really captures the Tiki style. And while you're at his site, check out his demo reel. Very nice!

       urlLink    How are you going to live each day? What are you going to do? Are you in need of a boost?  urlLink Keri Smith  offers up these  urlLink Daring Dice of Transformation  as a solution! From her site, you can print (I suggest cardstock), cut out, and paste together these dice, then give them a roll for inspiration! You might "play purposefully," dream loud," or like me, "nap big."&nbsp; urlLink

      Complacent. Suave. Pensive. No emotion is too difficult for  urlLink Eric to convey . With an extensive list of emotions, moods, and happenings, this site is filled with seemingly meaningless images of a very emotional Eric. But that's not all! You can also view some of  urlLink Eric's adventures ! With hilarious photo illustrations and great captions, these stories are not to be missed! (via  urlLink columbina )

      There's nothing like a good book. And trust me, the excerpts you're about to read are nothing like a good book.  urlLink The Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest  is a literary parody contest "honoring" Edward George Earl Bulwer-Lytton, who penned the famous opening lines, "It was a dark and stormy night."   The results of the contest are filled with many categories, including children's, detective, and science fiction among others. And from the "Dark and Stormy Night" category:    "It was a dark and stormy night--actually not all that dark, but more dusky or maybe cloudy, and to say "stormy" may be overstating things a bit, although the sidewalks were still wettish and smelled of ozone, and, truth be told, characterizing the time as night is a stretch as it was more in the late, late afternoon because I think Oprah was still on." &nbsp; (via  urlLink Blue Plaid Shirt )

      I love it when people give me instructions for things. Sure, it's good to discover and learn for&nbsp; yourself, but if someone can point me in the right direction, all the better. Which is why I was pleased to read  urlLink Eight things I wish I'd known when I started . This article gives some great things about working in design, things that I'll be keeping in mind or working on immediately. Good stuff. Now if only I could get the same helpful information for life in general... (via  urlLink hicksdesign )

      Starting today, I begin what will be known as "Favorite Movie Line Sunday." Each Sunday, I'll share one of my many favorite movie lines. Some are old, some are new, some are funny, some have funny accents. All have become a part of my daily life. I find that they are quite fun to recite in normal conversation. It kind of throws people. I like that.   And now, without further ado, today's movie line comes to you from a classic. It's best to say this line in a rather high, squeaky, british accent voice.&nbsp;  "I now declare this bridge open."    John Lennon, A Hard Day's Night

      This afternoon I took my sister and went to see  urlLink The Bourne Supremacy . Words to describe it: intense, exciting, sad. A warning: If you have trouble with motion sickness, the chase scenes may be a problem. They are very action packed! All in all, not a bad sequel. Pretty good actually.&nbsp;I enjoyed it very much.

      When you were younger, did you ever make sand art bottles? You know, you fill a bottle with layers of different colors of sand. You might fill the bottle at an angle to create a zig zag pattern, or you might poke the sand down on the sides with a small stick to create some great waves.   Now you can make the same great art online and with the mess or hassle! With this  urlLink sand art , you choose your colors and drop them in where you want them. You can even remove sand if it gets where you don't want it. Okay, so it's not exactly putting the sand in a bottle, and it looks more like colored pixel sand in an ant farm, but it's fun, relaxing, AND you can save it when you're done!

      A couple of weeks ago, I  urlLink mentioned  a new show coming to Cartoon Network. Well, the  urlLink  Foster's&nbsp;Home for Imaginary Friends  &nbsp;site has been updated. The site design is great (although it could be a bit large and slow to load), and gives a glimpse of how the show will feel. New features include a game (with new games coming each week!), clips, and desktop wallpaper and icons.  &nbsp;  The best news? The premiere movie comes on August 13! Don't miss it!

      I'm a visual person. I retain more when I read things than when when I hear them. It's also&nbsp;good when things are visually pleasing. It doesn't matter how great the content of something is, if it's not nice to look at, they've lost me. That's right. I judge books by their covers. And like the website of the same name,  urlLink I judge blogs by their covers . &nbsp; Not that I'm one to talk. My blog sits here, all template based, and in need of a redesign. (Is it a redesign, if I never designed it to begin with?)  urlLink Blue Plaid Shirt &nbsp;has felt the redesign itch after seeing so many favorite blogs get redesigned. So now, it's something that I'll be working on in my spare time. (see&nbsp; urlLink Nothing&nbsp;better to do? ) A change is needed, and eventually,&nbsp;a change will come. &nbsp; For now, don't judge me!

      If you're a fan of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, prepare yourself. You're in for a treat. A dear person took the time to scan the entire contents of Lewis Carroll's manuscript for  urlLink Alice's Adventures Under Ground , written before Alice in Wonderland came to be. The entire book was illustrated and written by hand by the author, and given as a gift to Alice Liddell's (the inspiration for Alice) mother. The entire book is there for you to read and enjoy! via  urlLink Robot Johnny .

This is Little Red Riding Hood as you've never seen it before. In order to understand the story, it's best to read it aloud. Although the words seem to be nonsense, when put together and read aloud, the sounds and rythym really do create the story of Little Red Riding Hood.  &nbsp; Wader ewe weighting four?

       urlLink    The things you can find at a dollar store...I tell ya. Yesterday my dad brought this hula pig home for me. It has a spring and can actually wiggle and do the hula. I'm not exactly sure why he got me this...and I'm not exactly sure what I'll do with it...but it's just quirky enough. So for now, it's sitting next to my computer grinning and doing the hula. Aloha!&nbsp; urlLink

      Anyone who has discussed graphic design with me (and some who haven't!) know about my passionate hate for the font Comic Sans. There is no good reason to use it and seldom have I seen it used well. My dislike for this font is so well known, that friends point it out to me when it is used. Today, a good friend even called to tell me that a client had requested that Comic Sans be used for a project. Such a moral dilemma! I don't even know what I would say if that happened to me. He has done his best to use it in a tasteful way.  For those of you that just don't understand and think that I'm crazy, I'm not alone! The folks over at  urlLink Ban Comic Sans  share my thoughts and feelings on this subject, and they even have some free alternatives to this horrible font. Please, please...stop the insanity! Ban Comic Sans!

      If you're like me, you wish that there were more hours in every day. Or at least you wish that you were able to have some time each day to do something mindless. When those few and far between "mindless moments" come along, you might want to check out the delightful games at  urlLink Orisinal . The style of these games is not typical of online games. The characters look soft and cute, and the music is soft, often classical pieces. And...the games are fun and easy to learn! We especially enjoyed  urlLink Chicken Wings Are NOT For Flying .

      Last night, while watching  urlLink Cartoon Network , I saw a segment they call  urlLink Whiskers, the kitten who can name fruit . They show this adorable little kitty sitting on a pillow atop a pedestal. They zoom in for a close up. The kitten looks at the camera. And then, it happens. She speaks! She names a fruit! It's amazing! This is no cartoon! It's the real deal!  And you may ask, "What fruit did she name?"  Mango.  I have since emailed Whiskers. I'll let you know when I hear back from her.

      Have you ever wondered about the secret life that your breakfast may be leading? While breakfast isn't always my thing, I can certainly appreciate the goings-on of a piece of toast. Mr. Toast, to be precise. In  urlLink A Slice of Mr. Toast , artist Dan Goodsell shows the everyday life of toast, as well as other characters in the series. Some are breakfast related (Joe the egg and Shaky Bacon), and others are just plain fun (Drunken Carrot and Sr. Cork).   Filled with funny stories and excellent illustrations,  urlLink The Imaginary World  website is a great place to check out!

      It appears that summer is over. Wait a minute! It's only July! Why is it that we can no longer enjoy this wonderful season? Target has started their summer clearance, and the school supplies are out at Walmart, a sure sign that summer is over. But if that wasn't bad enough, and you want to get  really  depressed, head over to Hallmark this weekend for their  urlLink Keepsake Ornaments Premier . Yep that does it. Summer is over. I missed out on all the fun. And I don't even have the slightest bit of a tan.

      When Disney's Monsters Inc. came out, I loved it. I especially loved the opening credits, designed by Geefwee Boedoe. And I was thrilled to own the book  urlLink The Art of Monsters Inc.  But, Cartoon Network may have created something almost as good. Coming in August, their new show  urlLink Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends  from Craig McCracken looks extremely promising. The style of the artwork is similar to that of Monster's Inc., but with the attitude and edge that Cartoon network is known for. This could be the next big thing!

      To celebrate the 4th of July, I set up my new computer. This seemed like a good idea. However, it was a bigger hassle than I anticipated. There were DSL software problems, and I was irritated.   With no solution in sight, I finished preparing my "Martha Stewart-esque" flag cake with the blueberries and strawberries. I then sat down to eat and pout. Apparently, the cake was just what I needed. I figured out my problems, and I'm now writing from the new computer! Yay!  What a great way to celebrate America's birthday!

      My dear friend Autumn asked me about blogs. So in response to her question, I offer up a few of the blogs that I like to check out on a regular basis.   My first stop is always  urlLink Robot Johnny.  In addition to having great infomation that is funny and up-to-date, he creates some excellent illustrations! Then I head to Veer's  urlLink The Skinny,  where they have cheeky comments about some excellent sites, many related to Graphic Design. I find this to be a great resource.  For inspiration and a good laugh, I enjoy reading Keri Smith's  urlLink Wish Jar Journal.  She includes words of wisdom, thoughts, and illustrations to boot!  And finally, when I feel like I have too much "stuff," that I am the biggest pack rat in the world, and I start asking myself "why am I keeping this?", I have a way to feel better.  urlLink My Urban Dig  is a showcase of someone's random items that they have kept, for one reason or another. Suddenly, I'm not so crazy.

      Finally went and saw  urlLink The Stepford Wives.  (I know, I'm a little behind on my movies.) I enjoyed the original very much, and have been wanting to see this new version for a while. Unlike the original, the Nicole Kidman version is more comedy than thriller and I laughed through the whole thing. I know that it wasn't a favorite among reviewers, but I liked it. So there.

      Why a Wild Olive? Taken from Romans 11:17 ("If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root."), the idea of being a "Wild Olive" has always intrigued me.  Originally, I thought this would be a perfect name for a band. Problem: I don't have a band, nor do I plan on starting one. Then I thought Wild Olive would be a good name for my graphic design work. Friends advised against this for various reasons. But I still really like "Wild Olive."  So...It's the perfect name for my blog.

      At long last!  urlLink Pantone's Colorstrology  is up and running! A few months ago, I saw this and thought it was kind of interesting. A few days later, the site was down with a message that they would be back. Well, they are and now it's better than before! I don't get into the whole astrology thing, I don't read my horoscope, I just don't believe all that. So this is a bit of a stretch for me. However, I like the idea of having a Pantone color assigned to my birthday.  My Pantone birthday color: Valerian--Pantone 17-3410 (A warm, deep lavender)  My favorite Pantone color: Pantone 221 (A warm, deep raspberry)  (I admit it, I'm a design geek.)

      My poor sister Anna...getting mentioned here twice in three days. It's her birthday at the end of the month, and as a gift, I got her a subscription to  urlLink Ready Made  magazine. We both love this magazine. It's filled with all sorts of great ideas and fun things to make. We're both keen on making the  urlLink Altoid speakers . I find it both relaxing and gratifying to make goofy little nothings. Recently, I've discovered some other excellent DIY sites.  urlLink Thrift Deluxe  hasn't been updated in a while, but still has some nice projects, and  urlLink Unique Projects  has just that: unique things to make using everything from wood, to metal, to paper, to cloth. Check 'em out!

      When my sister was young, she climbed the walls. Literally. Over a decade ago, little Anna started what is now known as  urlLink House Gymnastics . She would spread her arms and legs out to wedge helself between the walls of our hallway, and then climb up to the ceiling. And she could do it fast.  Now, with the help of  urlLink Harrison&amp;Ford , just about anyone can complete these amazing feats! Just follow the step by step instructions, and you'll be doing a  urlLink xXx  in no time!

      Today's movie line is great. The great part about this line (said with a Mississippi accent) is the excitement with which it is said, as Delmar exclaims his age when he would get out of prison...  "I'll only be 82!"   Tim Blake Nelson as Delmar, O Brother, Where Art Thou?
