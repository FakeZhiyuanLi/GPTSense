      just got back from a nite on the town with dad. well, not really...we just went to the movies. We saw M. Night Schyamalan's THE VILLAGE! ...it was alright. i have yet to decide whether or not i like it. or maybe whether i thought it was good...cuz i think i liked it..but i don't know if it was good. does that make sense? no...o well. so tomorrow is my last day here...i'm ready to go home. i don't get to see keevy :( but it's ok, i guess. we're gonna clean out the beretta, i guess i'm gonna do laundry...and we're gonna go visit some family...and then we leave bright and early sunday morn! well i guess that's about it..i have a really bad cramp in my leg and i don't know why....:( i hope it goes away.

      so here i am again sitting at dad's...chillin. It's actually nighttime now..my usual posting time...dad's sleeping now. not a whole lot lately, although i did get new shoes today which made me super happy :D. my bed is pretty messy right now tho...so i'm gonna have to clean that off before bed. Tomorrow, i go shopping AGAIN...lol, but w/ a plan this time. i come home sunday...in 2 days? 3? somethin like that. i'm ready..i mean, i love my dad..but i miss home. i love flatland!..lol. although driving here is pretty fun, what with the curves and hills and all. good experience at least. i've been meeting new ppl online lately. my new friend is canada-nate. lol. he's pretty cool. but i guess that's the update for the past couple of days. damn, dad is pretty far gone...his snores could wake up the neighborhood (if we lived in a neighborhood ;)..)

          alright..so i'm ready to come home already. actually not yet, i haven't gotten to go shopping, but that's not until saturday probably. yesterday tho, me and dad worked on the car for about 4 hours, we got a lot of stuff done. it was actually pretty fun, i got to use tools and everything. i don't know what we're gonna do today, i guess just hang out again, i'm sure we will find something to do. it rained like a mo fo yesterday. it was crazy pouring down...and the power even went out. I talked to spencer yesterday too..interesting..he's my ex-boyfriend. i haven't really talked to him in FOREVER! so yeah...that's about the highlites, i guess. not too much goin down here.

          ok, so now i'm in north carolina, chilling with my dad! (and his 3 cats) not too much is goin on, just enjoying the lazy days of summer..finally. i did drive here from the west virginia turnpike...which is not a modest haul. tonite we have a cook out to attend and the rest of the week remains unscheduled...just laid back activities, semi-spur of the moment. dad's cats are even kicking back, spaz (my cat) and then there's dog (?) and chief..i named that one..imagine that! lol. joe doesn't think that's its name..but what does he know, it's just his cat..lol. well, i'll try and chronicle my week..however, i don't know how well that will go. i didn't write last nite, cuz i was pretty exhausted.. and not too much happened...we rented school of rock and watched that..tis about it. i'm outtie

      tomorrow i leave for north carolina...to spend a week with my dad. My dad lives there, he just recently (2 years ago) got out of prison so I try to spend some time with him in the summer and after winter. i'm really tired, which is why i am writing so freakin' early. I prolly won't be able to write tonite, cuz i'll be snoozing. Today, jess and I had to get up at 5:45 am to go watch jimmy at DM camp. i am so tired, and i still have muny band and i still have to pack...and get directions to where we are going ... i have a lot to do. well, i guess that's it, just a disclaimer: i may not write every nite while i'm there, dad will prolly have me busy , lol!

It's about an hour and 45 minutes away. So cool, just the two of goin to see our best friend. We even made t-shirts that say (front): we love jimmy (he's my #1) and back: Kayt, hey jimmy, ur hott! lol. they are so cool...i'm really excited. today i was very busy, shoppin with my grandpa and all. so i think since i have to get up at g*d awful 6:00 tomorrow morning, i'm gonna check out now! i'm outtie

      So yesterday was jess's birthday. The big 1-6!... it was great fun, but unfortunately I had muny band and things, so i didn't get to spend ALL day with her, however we did stay up until 1:30 AM playing Mario Party. I had behind-the-wheel yesterday...yes, as my best friend was receiving the "plastic card of freedom," i was enduring my driver's ed instructor tell me when to turn left and right. Oh well. The sad part is that i don't even receive my freedom until sometime in late september...my birthday is in august :o! But that is my reason for not&nbsp; blogging last nite, i wasn't here, i was at my 2nd home. Today, we ventured across the river to Artmart and then to Union Station, and finally to the movies...we saw anchorman! it was alright, Will Ferrell is a comic genius! We ate at Spag...it was really good, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess while i'm here, i might as well say what was on my mind last nite. We went to drop micheal, one of Dan's friends off in Willow Creek. I think that was the first time that I had been back in Willow Creek since Dexter died. I guess I'm not as over it as I thought. It brought some painful memories back...i guess it showed cuz jess knew...it's still so hard. well, i guess that's it..now that i've thoroughly depressed myself again. I'm so stupid..geez! By the way...Happy Birthday Jess!

       Wow, so tonite was a blast. i had forgotten how to have that much fun. We went out to mazzio's, the town's local pizza hang-out. We were sitting around, me, jess, adam, tony, owen, nic, and brandon...plus a few extras, carrying on multiple conversations. i love that kind of thing, being involved in so many things at once. we went back to owen's and played cards...uno..of course, i won! :D but yeah..and owen has galaga in his basement. he rawks hard at that game, me on the other hand...eh, not so much. tony, nic, adam, and brandon were watching some weird ass pink floyd movie...so strange...but it was funny, cuz a coupla times that we would look over, it was like, flowers having sex and stuff. i was like OMG! but it was funny. A lot of ppl showed up later, like Eli, and Dan, and Jared. they are pretty cool cats. N e one ever notice how i used ... a lot? eh...o well. So this blogging thing is pretty calming, and fun, tho i kinda wish that other ppl would read it, and maybe comment. tell me that i'm not crazy or somethin. or even tell me i am. it would be nice to know...    p.s. the title comes from hangin out tonite...for some reason the conversation ALWAYS turned to Star Wars...Brandon and I couldn't decide if there was a name for star wars fans, like u kno, trekkies....

      so i'm hangin at jess's tonite...we watched south park and now we're watching Emperor's New Groove. i love how normal things are now. we are exactly the same as we were before the whole saga. It's great. we even made peanut butter cookies tonite (well, actually, i made the cookies..jess ate the dough) but it was great. it's such a relief. Jess did tell me that i was right, so i could refrain from i told u so, which was a good thing. now dan is having probs...he doesn't know what he wants, but like n e of us do. actually i do. i want someone i can talk to and they can make me laugh. seriously, that's it. i don't know. it seems like i'm not gonna find n e one soon..or n e one willing to comply. but it's ok, i'm in high school...i don't need to worry about that right now. right now i just need to worry about getting into the University of Illinois.

      so the drama is over, at least for me. i tried to post last nite, however, it wouldn't let me. but there was the whole tanner/jess thing last nite and the shit all hit the fan. it was crazy madness. i ended up in tears, jess was pissed at me, i couldn't sleep. bad stuff. but now everything's ok. i caved in of course, like always, however, it was prolly a good thing cuz i saw jess and mine's relationship goin down the drain and it killed me. so it's all better now. Jimmy leaves tomorrow for drum major camp, and now i'm corrupting Kelly and kyle by having them watch euro trip (the unrated version)...it's good for them tho. i guess that's about it. G'nite now.

      so i went on a walk tonite with pat...if you aren't me and are reading this, pat is my gay friend. We like to talk to each other and vent. we have a circle of friends that we used to call the "super seven"...pretty middle school, i kno, however, that was us. we had really good times when it was the 7 of us. i miss that..a lot. i've always been happy-go-lucky kaytlin...that's been me. but as of late, i haven't been. i've been like, depressed kaytlin or somethin. we had 2 people in our class die this past year...as a sophomore, i've lost 2 classmates. it always comes back to that.&nbsp; i've had to grow up so much in the past year, it really hasn't been good for me, i least in the short run it hasn't. my social life is so messed up. my friends are retarded, like obsessed w/ high school drama i swear. my one friend can't go out with the guy she's been dating cuz he has psycho parents, but she's still "devoted to him" however, now her best guy friend and her, who she's already gone out with twice, decide that they still have chemistry. now we are a really tight knit group, we've tried "inner circle dating" before, it doesn't work. all of us are worked up about it. and i'm tellin ppl this stuff which is prolly gonna get me in hot water but i really don't like the idea. I don't kno, i mean, i love my friend to death but&nbsp;i just am really tired of the high school drama...that's it for tonite..i gotta talk to my friends on messenger now..try to solve some problems, joy to the world.

      hi...for n e one other than me reading this. i think i'm gonna use this as a journal sort of thing. this all started from lindsey's site...(lindsey morgan bricker, RIP, 1988-2003)...i kinda started using that as a venting place, but in a roundabout sort of way. so i needed my own..so i decided to make one. i'm hoping it will be good for me. i like typing better than writing, so maybe i'll vent more often instead of keeping it all pent up inside. well i guess that's it for my first post. i just need to keep this in mind.

      wow, so i am super tired and it's been almost a week since my last blog...i'm such a bad kid. o well...last nite, i went over to megan g.'s house, and we watched 4 movies :O...natalie s. came over at like 2 a.m. or something crazy like that, and we stayed up til like 5:30/6-ish. it was crazy. o yea, then we had to get up to go shopping at mills. i've been goin goin goin. i just did get home from pat's house, after youth group, and of course, instead of using my time wisely, and sleeping, i'm on here! go figure. i'll prolly even stay up after i get off of here, and read some more, i'm almost finished w/ my book  The Chosen,   it's really good. next i think i start  The Jungle  and school will hopefully be starting soon enuff. i have a lot to do this week, so hopefully that will make it pass quicker. thursday, we're (jess, jimmy, tanner, danielle, and i) are goin to my uncle dennis's house to go tubing and things on the lake :D ..i'm really excited cuz it's gonna be a lot of fun, and wednesday, mom and i are goin BACK to mills to hopefully get my homecoming ensemble. friday, i'm not real sure what's goin on, however, i'm pretty sure that friday nite, i'm gonna go to the open house and find my locker and things! so that's exciting, and i have no clue what's goin on this weekend...we have grantfork parades...which sux, but other than that...who knows. it'll prolly be cram weekend..before school starts..cramming in as much "friend time" as possible. so this whole blog i've just been rambling...nothing of content has actually been said. isn't that amazing how you can do that sometimes...carry on a conversation about absolutely nothing. i mean, it' s not like i don't have stuff that is running through my head, worries, constant thoughts..but i choose, instead of venting them, to keep them inside, and instead babble to the internet world about my weekly schedule, which i'm sure EVERYONE cares so much about...eh well. i figure if you stuck with it long enough to read this...where there is some content...you are a saint of some sort (or ur jessica and ur trying to find out what is goin on this week ;)... ) or you are extremely bored...in which you should write a comment thanking me for occupying some of your time even if it has been wasted...at least you weren't wasting your time thinking about what to waste your time on. did you stay with that? depending on what time it is wherever you are, i'm proud of you. hell, even if it isn't the wee hours of the morning, or the late hours of the nite, i'm still proud of you. there was my "feel-good" moment for the night. just know that someone out there is proud of u...unless you're a murderer or something...but even then...you have probably done  something  good in your life. so good job! anyway..i think this may be my longest blog by far. and some of it was really good..some of it not so much. i think it goes in phases. lots of things in life go in phases. i think it's the way of the world. wow, that could be deep. but i really don't feel like goin there. if you do, leave a comment. i get bored too you kno, it would be nice if ppl would give me something to read so i have something to do..i mean look at all this work i went to to occupy u for however long you read this. seriously ppl....

      so yeah, according to my title, i'm sick!...which kinda sucks...it's not too bad..i'm not, like, dying or n e thing, just a sore throat, but it's still sux, i have to take drugs...lol. tonite, i've been really crabby, i'm not sure why. i think it may have somethin to do w/ andy and jess, but i'm not sure. i guess maybe cuz the guys all just fall in jess's lap. i guess it's more jealousy. but i'll get over it, it'll just take some getting used to again. like tonite, she's hanging out w/ andy, garrett, and jeanna. i guess i feel kinda left out, but if i were there, i would be the 5th wheel...i guess it's just different, a change..and it's kinda bothersome at first. well, i guess that's all that's on my mind. well, that and lindsey..but i dont' even kno what that's about, so i can't expand. i've just been thinking about her and jamie a lot. maybe it's that time again..but i sure hope not
