         Today I met up with Angela, Jacob, and Michael to get together and discuss our plans for France. It was a good little jam session and we hit all of the good topics like sex lube, gender roles, and where to gat a good pizza.     Next thing on the agenda is moving the apartment over to a one bedroom with my bro. It is not going to be the funnest thing that I have ever done in my life, but in two months I am moving to France so I will live with it.     I am beginning to think about the first couple of weeks and having to get acclimated to the speaking and accents. I will be in the hotseat like the French students at UNCC were this past semester.    It is definitely crunch time now. I have been saying that I cannot wait until July to get here because that will mean that I am very close to leaving and now, BAM, here it is. I have no money at the moment since I am trying to play catch-up from school this past year and trying to get things situated while starting two new jobs has proved demanding.    Wow, that was depressing. On a much brighter note. My brother has decided to go work over at Dressler's with me. My other brother is moving into a larger apartment in Paris and has a spare bedroom that is free to use whenever I want to go to Paris!!! Go Fredy!!!    Well, it is getting very late and I have a lot to accomplish tomorrow.

      I am not sure if I spelled that quite right, oh well. Thinking back to last year when Timmers, Charm, and Thomas were on our way to Florida. It was a blast staying there for ten days and hitting the beach a thousand times. Miami is beautiful and I can see myself there one day. I might need to live a little to the North so I don't get gobbled into the late night seen. Just got done chatting with LucyJune about life and above all else our meeting with the other assistants on Tuesday. Gonna make a list and check it twice.   Went to the 2nd job and helped out the fellas. It is pretty good work. I felt like sipping some suds after in that machismo mentality. A good day's work deserves a little reward doesn't it. Not for long, I took my Jules for a walk afterwards and noticed the big, ripe, luscious blackberries hanging in the midst of briars. The briars resembling the impenetrable fortress of Troy. I threw then my Trojan horse and came back with a good 2.5 quarts of Helenesque berries. Damn, those babies are beautiful! Can you say blackberry pancakes? That's right. Some of that Wright's bacon, nice bit of maple syrup and a dollop of whipped cream and butter, simply irresistible. If you are hungry come on over.  It is getting late and I need to start packing in the morning.  See you in the morning Skippy!!!

      Well, I now have two jobs and a third in staging being interviewed for on Monday. I am getting ready to have Saturday's only to myself with a bank roll for France if I am lucky. Just got a phone call from the one telling me I can come on over until I have to leave if I want to. I am ironing for my other job and then I am out the door.   I am beginning to get nervous about my arrete for the assistantship so I hope that it comes in soon.   Sorry for the boring post, I will try to lend a little more spice next time.  Cheers

      Tonight I went out for what could be the alst night of the summer with crew. Because today I received the news that as long as I passed the physical tomorrow I have my second job. It pays really well and could be my saving grace with paying off my bills before I leave. I did play a little golden tee and lost by one stroke on the first nine holes and then whooped'em in the second with a -6 and the front nine record. Kat, Caya, Adam, Jacob, Michael, and my "favorite" little server with the cute hair and shoes Lynn. Good times that I will miss. See you guys in France or when I come home. Cheers, have a biggie beer for me!!!

      Well, this week is going by extra fast because I have to be out of this apartment by Wednesday of next week. I am a little weary of moving back with the parents but it is going to be a good time to hang out with the family before I leave.     Tonight was a decent night at work....hope there are a lot more of these before I leave. Every day I grow more restless to be doing something for France.

      Well, I wanted to write natalie, sans h. a little comment and found that I would need to create my own blog to do so. I am also travelling to France next year as an assistant in Lyon and a student at the Jean Moulin university. Currently I live in the largest city in North Carolina and attend a state school here. I am majoring in Accounting, Finance, and French. I also have a passion for food, wine, and restaurants. I have been cooking for 12 years and I am serving at the moment to earn as much as possible for France.

      Here I am in the last month before I leave on my journey to France. I am filled with anxiety, doubt, intrigue and anticipation. I finally picked up the arrete from my parents which arrived earlier this week. This is the letter that I needed in order to get my visa later in August before I leave. I am working so much right now that I have not had any time to practice my French so last week I picked up an audio program on CD. It is below my level but is helping me practice my accent and pronunciation. The next month I have a lot to do, I am trying to sell my truck before I go so I will not have a car payment to worry over while I am in France. I think I found someone to buy it, but I have to pay about 2,000 out of pocket. I am cool with it because it saves me almost 4,500 in the long run. This will come in handy next summer when I am backpacking through Spain.     While I am sure that the time will pass quickly enough I am hoping to work another three weeks and then chill out for a few days travelling around seeing everyone before I leave. Hopefully I can make enough to go down to the beach or somewhere for a weekend to chill out. Then again, Paris is only 30 days and a wake up. One can hardly wait........

      I was thinking about bringing something to work the other day for my co-workers at the freight terminal. The guys are really a great bunch of people that remind me a lot of the people that I grew up around. This area has been so overwhelmed with new faces that it is hard to see the people who have been here all along. I am not being anti-growth, just reminiscing a little to the time when I worked my first restaurant, before my love of French cuisine took root. Lancaster's B-B-Q.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; There is a certain satisfaction that I realize when I smell the slow-smoking of pork "Boston Butts." That dash of acidity that the Eastern North Carolina style offers with some White House apple cider vinegar. Then you just need to steam a seedless hamburger bun and scoop, slap, and spread a generous portion of mustard cole slaw. Drooling.......... Then, after you take that first bite and you smell the bakers dozen of fresh fried hush puppies rolling over the table, you reach and bobble-bounce the steaming treat to your lips.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your conscious tells&nbsp;you that&nbsp;it is&nbsp;not nutritious but nevertheless you bite through and taste the Sweet Betsy with onions from House Autry, delicious. In the land of soft drinks available today there isn't one that I would take over a thick-as-molasses, styrofoam cup, filled with sweet tea, ice and a wedge of lemon. Although I am going to France for a year and I try to be urbane, you will never shake all the adopted southern boy out of me.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have about 5 weeks left until I leave for my adventure. The freight job is going to end on the 11th of August because I am a casual worker and the union will not allow me to work more than 30 out of 90 days. I have been so worried about making money. I think that this way will be better so I&nbsp; can maybe go up to Lancaster's with the family, have myself a cup of sweet tea, laugh a little, and remember where I came from. I think that I have been so obsessed with getting a leg up that I didn't realize how much I will miss Dad's hamburgers and sugary summer desserts, coffee with my mom, wracking my little sisters nerves, a little politics with the big sister, or just hanging with my brother.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Good times, Good food, Great People.....

      It looks as though I have been released from the Army without being called up. My last day was on the 17th of July. I have officially seperated from the US Army. It is kind of a weird feeling though. I went to reenlist about a year and a half ago before the war in Iraq actually started, although, I knew it was coming. I told the retention officer that I would reenlist as long as I was allowed to choose a new MOS, but more importantly that I was allowed to go to France for a year when I returned. She said, "Do not reenlist of you want to go to France because they will not let you go to France for a year." I offered to go to Iraq and help and they said no. So, I guess I should not feel any remorse.  &nbsp;  Now I have only around 43 days and a wake-up until I leave for France. The new job is working me so much that the time actually is passing pretty well.  &nbsp;  I am getting excited talking about the things I will be doing on the Assistants website. For those of you who do not know it is  urlLink www.assistantsinfrance.com . I live for that site, and it has become a little family for me that I know I will use as a support in France when the going gets rough. Thanks LeeAnn!!! Today I posted a thread about wine country in France. I want to get drunk with the intoxication of the beautiful vineyards rolling through Bordeaux. Perhaps, I can bump into an old fixture of the area who sees my enthusiam and invites me in to sample some of the families vintages. Although I know a&nbsp;lot of the major chateaux are owned by larger companies I am hoping for a little luck. Even a glimpse into the old world of France. If I am lucky I could work the harvest and nibble baguette and cheese after toiling all day in the hills. Who knows, my romantic side is coming out. OOOPS!!! I have to make sure that I do not spill my milk on the way to the market, I am running late for work. Thanks for stopping by......&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Well,&nbsp;I now have a decent&nbsp;job even though I am working unbelievable hours. I do think, however, &nbsp;that this will help me out in the long run because I am going to be used to the hours in France by the end of the summer. I just hope that I start getting paid soon. The three week wait for my paycheck is becoming a little annoying.&nbsp;I have put the restaurant on hold for the most part. I am working one day a week there and using the money to just buy my lunches at work. I have so much to do before I leave and I hope that my arrete de nomination arrives soon so I can get my visa. &nbsp; Oh, although I did not design this site as a political forum I wanted to say that I am voting for Kerry/Edwards this November. I have put up with Georgie for too long. He is creating a huge deficit and putting us in a terribly precarious position of being able to defend ourselves. Not to mention that he is not a smart man and keeps showing us that he is Dick Cheney's puppet. &nbsp; OK, I think that will suffice.

      I think that things are really beginning to fall into place. I have a decent paying job that allows me to get as much overtime as I can handle and I found the magic supply/demand curve for my truck. Sometimes in life it seems like you are working and not going anywhere, then you look back and say to yourself, "I came all this way." My motto is to never stop moving forward and do not let the little things get you down. Times were very tough over the last six months and I am now coming into the light.   Ok, enough of the reminiscent mumbo jumbo. This week I am working 60 hours plus at the new job until they don't have any work for me. Which, apparently will not be until December but I am not worried about that at all!!!! Only tough part is that I have not even been to the pool this summer. I guess that is just one of the opportunity costs I am making. I will make up for it snowboarding in the Alps next winter.

      I have been so neglecting of my blog the last week and a half. I started working the new job moving freight. The pay is pretty good but unfortunately being able to talk about France is out of the question because even though I am a temporary fix I think that I would be let go. Not to mention the fact that it seems the farthest these guys make it outside a tractor trailer haul is Myrtle Beach, SC.    I must say that I am very excited about leaving in eight weeks. I am trying to work as much as possible since it looks as if I will be paying the payment the entire time I am gone.   On the upside last night at the restaurant ( www.dresslersrestaurant.com urlLink   ) I met a three patrons from the UK. It was not a great night for my pocketbook but one of the guys at the table was hilarious. They were the age where you are just happy to be around people and I think they enjoyed my youth too, not the lecturing types. We discussed France and the UK under our breathes because only a select few at the restaurant know that I am leaving. I asked the guy that was visiting from over-the-pond if I could get his number and we could hang out a day in London when I go to visit for a weekend. He was very adamant about me coming over. He said that if I come over he will come and hang out. Pretty cool in my opinion, sometimes things are just meant to happen.

      Yesterday I was going about my own business when I got the phone call. Apparently I worked myself out of a job. I worked 29 days at the freight dock and as a result was let go before the 30th day. This was done to prevent me from being able to join the union and be put on a preferential list. I am a little dissappointed but also relieved at the same time. I am going to have to sell my vehicle now and I am trying to call everyone back that I blew off after I thought I was going to keep it. Murphyslaw is taking effect I guess, but not taking control. I will sell the truck and have more money as a result to do things while I am abroad. I phoned the restaurant immediately and asked to pick up some shifts and luckily was given the go-ahead.    I have 14 days and a wake-up until I leave for Paris, I am ready to go. I am feeling the anticipation and a little anxiety as well. It fuels me to get things done everyday towards my trip. This Saturday is also my going away party and I have to organize that as well. I will be making some lovely burgers, ribs, and other back yard faves!!! My mouth is waterind already from thinking of the delicious treats.

      While we were toasting the Gods last night, we did pour out a little alcoholic concoction last night in the company of friends here at Chez Murphy. Lea, my french teacher and good friend is in town from Texas Tech University. So, since I have not had a night out in a while from working I arranged a rendezvous at the Flying Saucer, my little watering hole. We had some good conversation and then headed back to my place for some cheese and wine. The weather could not have been better, almost chilly as I walked my guests outside in the waning hours of the morning. Then, since the sleep patterns have me like a little nocturnal social butterfly, I headed over to Kat & Caya's place for a little delve into politics, religon, anything else that can cause controversy. I am 25 days away from my departure for France. I hope that the people that I am in contact with there are as great as those that I have met over the past few years. Kat, Caya, Jacob, Michael, Lea, Come, Homere(when you find the place), Tolu, etc........ You have made the past year one that I am going to remember for years to come. I would like to say that we will all meet up again one night when the planets line up for us, but, if it never happens I wish you all  the best. We are the future, and although we will become the past, let nothing stand in your way. Do not take "no" for an answer, if you will it then you can make it.  Ok, that is enough of the power talk for today. To get your very own "Power of Pursuit" video seminar please send $59.95 in cash, certified check, money order, or bearer's bonds to Sean. Please allow 6 to 8 years for shipping. Enjoy the program!!!

         Well, as I get closer to leaving I knew that there would be a big push to get things done before I leave and a possible bump in the road as well. I am at the bump right now, I am going to push through and make everything work out. I am working so much that I have no life, and it is all going into my truck, just to sell it. I wisj I never would have gotten this truck in the first place but my Honda was stolen and it happened. It is a great truck and I would like to keep it, but I would much rather have my freedom form the payments while I am in Lyon. I guess that I am just having a rough day and I need to "push on through to the other side."
