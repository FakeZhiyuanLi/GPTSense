      man ive been working. if not the lawn, or the kids, or the car, or the fucking lawn mower, its been actual paying work, which im guessing is good. still looking for a job in the prattville / montgomery area, but im thinking about other places as well, dallas, austin, south carolina, atlanta, who knows. anywhere is good right about now.   Alot of my ghost team is now working on a game title for a company over in germany, really cool, going to be in the crytek engine. Crytek is a great fucking engine, but man farcry blew, i hope its better than that. that had to do with the game though, so im hoping they pull it off, i cant wait. they are looking for a game producer as well, i would love to take that position, and prolly could, just with the fam and a starting game company with enough funding for a year, not a good mix, not for me or the company. Relocation to germany is cool though, i loved it the three years i went over. Kids would love it, but like i siad, just cant do it.  Blogger is getting a workover soon i hope, im still trying to think of a good design, and looking into some other options for it. it seems alot of the bloggers that are heavily customized are movabletype bloggers, but i really like the blogger interface,and the ease of it, so i think i will stick with it for now, and just customize what i can for it. i would be nice if they started giving you more choices to implement stuff like calenders, search options, etc.  more later on.

As far as updates, nothing really, my mom might be moving to dallas, if that happens, ill prolly not going to be to far behind her..so we will see how the next couple monthes go.

      it wont stop raining down here for god sakes.  My lawn mower was broken and i didnt get to the lawn for two weeks, now its supposed to rain for the next 5 days, and my lawn looks like something off the discovery channel. its amazing really. so now im sitting here, with my parents lawn mower, and waiting to mow the lawn again, under the watchful eye of my elderly neighbors. they evidently watched the news, and took care of business before the storm.  fuck em. :)

I hope everyone is happy with it, i am most certainly happy with it. as far as other news, i found an animator for ghost finally, yay!. con artist seems very nice, and has a very professional manner about him. i hope that this works out well, we will get the game out very soon. i will post more later.

      Was sitting here eating my pudding, and the age old question came up, wtf is tapioca. one of those things you always think about, but never "google". so anyways, i did,and i get this:   Tapioca is basically a root starch derived from the cassava, or yuca plant. It's often used to thicken soups and sweeten the flavor of baked goods, and it makes a dandy pudding. Budi Acid Jaya, a tapioca starch producer in Indonesia, uses processed cassava roots to make raw materials for crackers, toothpaste, paper, and textiles. Visit the site for an overview of the starch production process. It involves lots of heat and water.  We suggest you don't try making your own tapioca at home. Cassava roots have traces of cyanide in them! The ever resourceful Mayans figured out how to extract this poison for their blow darts, leaving the uncontaminated roots free for eating.    ok this is all well and good, but you still not telling me what the little clear things are, swimming around in my pudding dammit. i need to know these things. anyways, as usual, if you have answers, send em to me at illogicmindz@gmaildotcom.

      its hot as hell down here, and the most anyone can do is look for the nearest water source and jump in. even the water is hot, it doesnt do any good, but yet we keep going. im guessing its better than not going. Ive been working some, and looking for a job has slowed down, i figured, if i dont have a job during the summer take advantage of it, it may be the only time in your life that this happens. anyways, im prolly going to be doing the same thing again, ill talk more when i get back.  **This is the message i sent to the email blogger a couple days ago. its since been returned twice, and was set to retry for 4 more days. When it posted, it had breaks, and screwed the body all up. im guessing the email blogger has some work to be done. :)

      i had six to give out, and they are all gone. family, friends, etc. i had siz, which i did suspect, dont know how long ive had them, im guessing i didnt notice the bright red, "invite friends to google mail" in the corner till now. i cant wait to get more, and get more friends online. I see that some people are selling them, man some people will do anything for a buck. I refuse to do something like that, why sell something you can get for free? i mean damn people. how you going to sell something you get for free? makes no sence. i also heard that hotmail was blocking invites, does anyone know if thats true? thats pretty dirty if they are. anyways, just updating, etc. ill holla back later on.

      been reading many blogs, it seems that everyones has some sort of meaning to benefit others, but then again, maybe there are alot just like mine. most have been doing it way longer than i have. i wish i had something that i could teach people or post about that people would find important. but i dont see where im talented enough to actually teach anyone something that they dont already know. i mean i guess i could do like webdesign, but where can you not find that?  running a mod? well, its not that it takes something you can teach, it takes leadership, and i believe you have that, or you dont. what else do i have? 4 kids, well, i cant really teach that, im still learning myself. so what do i post? i mean, you have this urge to be orginal, and the first to do something. I dont have those skills, so i sit here complaining once again, about what i do. I really want to build games, but once again, the only thing im good at is bringing the talent together, and making them work. i know what a good game is, what makes a good game, and how to talk to the team to put it together, but im not like some, that can model, animate, etc etc. i can texture, but damn, i dont do that as good as most. i would love to practice more, but once again, that time thing bites me in the ass.  with 4 kids, im guessing my choices are limited unless i luck out, or they grow up and move out. by then i might be dead. i just feel im stuck, and i want to move forward, doing something new, and exciting. or working somewhere i enjoy. ill keep looking.

      ghost is in need of some talent, namely animation. we need both a weapons animator, and a player animator. player animator more than any, because we are behind in that department. weapons are done, but we need someone to reanimate or edits some animations, and it seems our animator has feel off the face of the earth. this happens at times, be it a woman, everquest, or work. (trust me, those are the three culprits most of the time.)anyways, if anyones interested, please let me know. we are serouisly hurting in that department, and im looking to get this damn game finished.

      The new firefox 0.9 browser, and the email client Thunderbird 0.7 are both now available for download.  Old themes are not compatible with the new firefox browser however, so they are disabled. sucks, i had a nice theme for both. anyways, seems firefox now has a update manager for its themes, and extensions, and im not quite sure about thunderbird yet, i think they added a spellchecker and a couple other things.  If anyone builds extensions, im looking for a task manager extension, plus a extension that will return junk email, like it was denied by the server, as if the account doesnt exist. If anyone is capable of doing either, let me know. i will love you forever. :)

      everything im doing is going slow right now. ghost development is crawling, website work is crawling, cash flow is crawling. i would give anything right now to have to much work to deal with. i really need to get a job, freelancing is going to kill me in taxes come the end of the year, i dont even want to think about it.   My mom is also looking for a job too, christ, tech jobs right now are shit, plus my location isnt helping any. Alot of high end websites in alabama, let me tell you. Cost of living is so low, thats why this place is like a fucking black hole, the second you leave, you think anywhere else is way to expensive, and want to come back, making the same salary. that would be nice, but it never holds very long. where are all these tech remote jobs i keep hearing about? i would love for some web design firm to pay me to sit at the house and do websites. Then again, im nothing special, i know flash and html, yea sure, but i do shit else. the days of a designer just doing graphics, are gone. nowadays, that want someone all in one, that can program and do graphics, and are not really worried about what it looks like. Firms that can do both make alot of money, but those firms have designers that are equal to me, or better.   Is there any jobs that require bitching and complaining? im good at that. :)

      excellent. i love it. ive been wanting a web based account that had all the features that a regular email account would have, and gmail is it. i have transfered all of my stuff over to my gmail account, and will be using it exclusively. The interface is great, and the fact that you can see replies to the emails you send, and they all be in the same window, and even the snippet preview displays the latest response or reply, is perfect. I sent a email today to the support, asking to allow the option to turn off messages included in replys, i think it will make reply interface easier to read, it might be included, and i missed it, im sure support will tell me. anyways, thats my thoughts, im very pleased, cant wait to see what else they do with it.

      well, if you cant tell by now from the domain, i run a mod called G.H.O.S.T. Ops: The Avalon Project. This project has been my baby for damn near 3 years now, and im in charge of the team, finding the talent, and organizing the mod etc etc. right now, we are so close to release, i can taste it. the only talent im lacking is an player animator, and we have been through at least 4, none of which can complete thier task, for whatever reasons. Its so frustrating, i cant find the talent, or get the talent to work, meanwhile the zeal for working on a hl1 mod is dying due to the release of new, better engines, and the upcoming hl2. alot are working on hl2 mods, which i have no idea how, you dont even have a sdk? anyways, we will release, come hell or high water. i will find the talent somewhere, or it will come to me. let us hope. anyways, back to looking. talk to you later on today.

      just got finished playing it for the first time, seems cool. the controls are a bit sluggish, but once you get used to it, its good. Each player has a distinct advantage, one of them, being deadeye, which is a fast, dead on shot of the whole clip, which if used right seems to dominate the multiplayer. i only played multiplayer, and only for about three hours, so i cant say anything about the whole game, but what i know of it is enjoyable.  As far as work, havent been doing much. i got comps to do for some people, setting up some network stuff, and planning all that out etc...but i havent been very productive, since its been hot as hell here, and ive had my ass at the pool. i got to get it in gear this week though, so ill be busy most of the time. Im still looking for a job in the montgomery area, so if anyone has any ideas where the good web design / interactive design jobs are, let me know.  Also, just finishing up, im looking for a gmail invite if anyone would be so kind, so send me a email if you know where i can get one. :P

       LOS ANGELES, California (AP) -- State Education Secretary Richard Riordan jokingly told a child her name, Isis, meant stupid dirty girl, prompting the head of the California NAACP on Thursday to call for his resignation.   while this is interesting enough, we have this.   Democratic state Assemblyman Mervyn Dymally, who had scheduled a protest by civil rights organizations, canceled the demonstration after an apparent mix-up over the girl's racial background.Dymally was quoted in the San Jose Mercury News Thursday saying the child was a little African-American girl. Would he (Riordan) have done that to a white girl?  The girl is white, with blonde hair.    whats interesting is that in the dictionary the word civil means Of, relating to, or befitting a citizen or citizens. where does that have anything to do with the color of someone? thats all i got to say.

      well, went to mobile, seems that the job isnt all that thrilling. even if they offer me the job, i dont know if ill take it. its just so fucking boring. really. the people, the office, everything. as far as everything else, been going slow, ive just been trying to make money. its been a while since i posted, but im here. looking for work, doing work, and trying to find a job is consuming all my time. anyways, ill check in more later, and try to keep this more up to date.

      working, watching fireworks, working, playing, driving. Went to mobile this weekend, had a job offer down there, thought i would check it out. seems ok, just worried about moving, and kids, and nieghborhoods, and school districts, and finding places, and changing doctors, and all that jazz. but hey, i guess if it works out that way, it works out. job is...ok, its for a national magazine, and i have a potential to learn print design there, which would be nice. i know layout and such, but learning inks and fonts and print etc would be cool. just makes me nervous i guess. on other fronts, ghost is doing well, we are moving along, we just hope to get it out soon, its looking good though, so we have our fingers crossed. Montgomery had thier fireworks display, christ you know there is nothing to do in this town, downtown montgomery looked like new york on the blackout, people were everywhere, it was insane. the display, it was ok i guess, fuck, its fireworks. :) the rest, is blah, even for this blog so ill spare you. :)

      Google has updated Gmails Terms of Service on Monday, prohibiting users from engaging in commercial activities with their Gmail invitations. Apparently, Google is not very happy with all the Gmail invitations that were being sold accross the Internet and has decided to put an end to this officially.   The new policy reads Sell, trade, resell or otherwise exploit for any unauthorized commercial purpose or transfer any Gmail account, will likely spelled the end for biddings of Gmail invitations on eBay and Internet forums. Although users can now no longer sell these invitations, I believe that the endless the Gmail queue requests will continue until either everybody has got an account, or they eventually lose interests, or Gmail becomes publically opened. Until which ever one of those happened, expect more GIVE ME GMAIL! to come.   Best thing they could have done. :)

      Man its been a while since the last time i did this. Been working my ass off, and doing the game, havent had time for a update lately, but ill try to stay more current. My blog is about absolutely nothing, so lord knows who reads it, they never leave comments if they do, so i might be doing this for my own amusment. Anyways, just got done watching Penn & Tellers BullShit. What a excellent show, it doesnt get much better than that.  In other news, still without a job and doing freelance, which has picked up, but i still want to work somewhere. im applying in the Dallas area, so hopefully that will pan out soon. As far as the game goes, still have animator trouble, and its going so slow, we need to move on so bad. well, ill try to stay more current, if anyone missed me. :)
