      Well, Jonny's party was great fun.  Everyone's costumes were really cool.  The Indians (I should probably say Native Americans but hey) all had feathers and stitched waistcoats and stuff, the cowboys all had boots, checkered shirts and hats, and the businesspeople were all smart and suit-ish.  I was very pleased with myself because I completed all the aims in my envelope, and I must at least have done the 'make sure everyone knows Clem (the sales rep from my rival company) for the low-down, dirty double crosser he is' one right, because in the last half hour when people could die, he had about 10 people lining up to kill him!!  It was very amusing actually, and you killed people by playing rock-paper-scissors.  I also managed to get the land for South West Rail, as well as make an ethically sound deal (my character was very ethical!) that everyone was pleased with.  I also managed to find out who'd murdered (or at least beaten up until he had a heart attack) the ranch owner, which I was pleased about as last time I did one of these none of us had a clue!  You also had these 'ability cards' which meant that after you'd talked to someone for, say, 5 minutes they'd have to show you a secret or something.  Only the boys (OK, some of the boys) always claimed you hadn't been talking for 5 minutes yet and would try and escape so I'd be trying to run round the small gap behind the tent whilst attempting not to fall into the holes or onto the roots in my high heels.  Which was fun. And Jonny seemed to really like his Barbie present!!  Well, OK, he found it amusing anyway. One of the most fun things was double-dealing and blackmailing people (I think I should become a professional blackmailer!!) and trying to work out who was lying to you.  I have no idea what D (as Judge Paulson) was doing but he was making deals with everyone then the next minute he wouldn't even know you!  Irritating, yet funny. It was a good job Saturday was interesting because nothing much happened on either Sunday or Monday.  I had an opticians appointment yesterday, and he did the usual put orange dye in my eye then turn my eyelids inside out, which is horrid but I'm becoming more used to.  And we've been given 3 weeks to do our maths coursework so everyone is frantically thinking up questionnaires. Not much else going on here, I'm still obsessing over Wimbledon though.  Sprem went out today!  I don't believe it!  She's like the coolest player ever and her match with Venus rocked.  Plus she makes me laugh.  I spent all yesterday evening watching Tim's match I couldn't tear myself away.  And he kept on losing all these easy points where he could have won the whole match so simply, and then with the tie break -  I was finding it hard not to grab a cushion.  That is really sad. But yeah, to summarise the last few days: Murder Mysteries rock, so does Wimbledon, Coursework doesn't.

      Hmm, Steve, that is a good point about Jonny reading my blog, I hadn't thought of it, but don't worry, I don't think he will.  And his party's tonight, wahey!  It should be really fun, as long as I can work out what's going on! Anyway: Wednesday.  I wrote a long post about it on Thursday, but when I was about a sentence from the end my computer crashed so I went and watched Wimbledon instead.  Sprem is the coolest player ever!!  I am majorly addicted to Wimbledon actually, its slightly worrying.  I mean, I never cared this much about the football - I was laughing on Thursday night!!  I thought it was very ironical.  But I was also scared because everyone else bar Mim in the room was jumping up and screaming at every goal.  It was terrifying.   But that wasn't what I was talking about.  I did very badly in my shot on Wednesday.  I got a metre less than I got last week, and if I had got the same score I'd got last week, I would have won.  Grrrr.  And overall, we did really badly, we didn't even come 2nd, we were 3rd.  And even though it wasn't raining, it was FREEZING.  So much so that one of my friends who shall remain nameless took to standing in very distorted positions under the hand dryer in the girl's loos just to warm herself up.  Talking of the loos, they were disgusting.  Worse than ours, and that's saying something.  They even had that horrid plastic toilet paper.  I've never been so glad I had tissues with me in my life.  (Come to think of it that's a lie: I was more glad I had tissues when we were in Prague and my new sandals were rubbing and we had no plasters so I had to pad out my shoes with the tissues.  And then do it again 5 minutes later, because the tissues disintegrated!!) Nothing much happened on Thursday, we got given our Data Handling Maths Coursework, but that's basically it.  The coursework doesn't look too bad, only I get confused with Data Handling and never know which graph I should use when. Yesterday I went to a Bobby Ball evening at our church.  He's one half of Canon and Ball, who apparently used to be very famous but I am too young to have ever heard of them! ;)  It was fun because loads of my friends were there (the only reason they all came was because Amy and I practically forced them, but that's not the point!) only for some reason they'd decided to sit at the front (which meant, seeing as how we'd told them to come, we really had to sit there too) which put them directly in the firing line of lots of Bobby's comments.  It was funny though because he ignored us and just concentrated on the boys! And the boys had this Kaliber drinking contest, because there was loads there and they found it disgusting, which was very amusing.  I think the record was 16 gulps. I'd better stop typing now because we have people to lunch and I'm being kind of antisocial, but I'll write again soon about Jonny's party and whether anyone actually managed to find the murderer. (And whether my company - South West Railways - managed to win the railroad war!)

      Oops.  Haven't posted for a while.  Well, only 3 days, actually.  They've just been an extremely loooong 3 days. Sunday was pretty boring really.  We went to church, which was fine, but then I had nothing to do for the afternoon or evening.  And Mum was adamant when I was begging her at 10pm that she was not going to come out into the garden, light lots of candles, build a bonfire and dance round it with me going "Aiaiaiaiaia!" to celebrate Summer Solstice.  Which I thought was very boring of her, but you know.  And then I was going to get up to see the dawn, but decided I was too tired.  I woke up at about 5:30 anyway, but that's not the point.  Although it was annoying. Oo, random fact I found out - at Summer Solstice in Sweden, they whack each other round the head with plastic hammers!!  Weird yet probably very fun!! Nothing exciting happened on Monday except we got given the title for our English coursework essay on poetry.  Something to do with comparing 2 William Blake poems, which no matter what Mr. Howard says I do not find particularly optimistic - lines like "babes reduc'd to misery" don't strike me as immensely happy.  But anyway, its kind of boring, and we're going to have to do about 5 different analysises on each line, but I suppose it could be worse.  And it does mean we won't be doing much else in our Lit lessons. Today, I bought a birthday present for Jonny Darley.  I was going to buy it yesterday, but then we got grounded, so I had to wait... Anyway, my friend Sophie and I clubbed together, and in the end (it is so hard getting presents for boys!  Why do they have to be so difficult?  I mean, toiletries and make-up are off the list basically straight away - we hope!) we got him some Heroes and a Shelly birthday doll that's really sweet.  We were bored!  We got this really cool Barbie card as well, its really huge and all glittery... Anyway, I'd better stop writing now and start getting my stuff together for tomorrow, because I'm going to Southampton Sports Day.  I don't think I'll win, but it should be fun.  Wish me luck!! xx

      Well, yesterday was, um...interesting. We - Y10 - were leading assembly for the first time.  Things got off to a good start in the run up when no one (including the boy supposed to be overseeing the organisation!!) except me and 3 others turned up to the planning meeting.  So we drafted together a rough plan but the teachers didn't know whether we were leading this week or next.  In fact, they told us on Thursday.  Helpful. So on Thursday lunchtime we sorted everything out, practised a small sketch for the first time, and sorted out who was playing in the worship.  Or so I thought. I turned up on Friday to play my flute, thinking that Ed Graham was leading the worship.  However, it turned out he wasn't even playing, so there we were 5 minutes before the assembly started trying to sort out the songs, who was doing what, and what the heck we were going to do without a leader.  The answer?  Muck it up.  Its harder than you think trying to lead worship on your flute, especially if you have no idea what you're doing as that was the one thing you'd completely left to someone else.   For instance, we were singing In Christ Alone at one point.  One of the singers hadn't ever heard the song before, so when I start doing the twiddly flute bit for an intro, they started singing.  So I stopped, she goes 'I don't know the song!' and so  I  end up singing the first verse instead of playing, only then I play the twiddly bit in between verses, and they start singing again!  At which point I was about to give up on the flute when Sophie (thank you SO much!) came to my rescue and walked up the front to sing, letting me play flute again.  But I gave up on the twiddly bit. Anyway, think of that happening for 4 songs, and you'll see why I was kind of alternately laughing and cringing the whole way through.  But hey.  It was, at least so I thought, pretty hilarious, but I think other people found it less funny and more embarrassing than me. Also, there was a new boy visiting the school for the first time.  Interesting introduction to the school!!  Poor kid he'll think all our assemblies are terrible.  Especially as the drama didn't go particularly well either.  Although a couple of people did respond to the prayer thing, but only after we'd sent D Timms over to look as though he was responding, so that the other people didn't have to be the first.  It worked!! Oh, he got a big cheer when he came on as the whale who ate Jonah, as well.  He always gets the stupid parts, but everyone loves him, so it works great.  We had him as the iceberg that sank the Titanic, once.  That was excellent. Anyway, the rest of the day was pretty mundane.  We played squash again, which is really fun, only I'm absolutely pants!  And my head goes funny from all the echoing!! Oh yes, I forgot to say, interesting photo you chose, Sarah!!  I don't remember when that was taken, do you? I've just finished helping Mum give our guinea pig Gem her medicine!  She's got some sort of mite on her, which apparently usually doesn't affect them at all, only when they're stressed and upset.  Which I find quite sweet, as we had to put Gem's sister down about 3 weeks ago.  She must be grieving.  But we had to wash her with medicated shampoo this morning, which was a new experience.  It wasn't too bad in the end, to be fair, but at the beginning the poor thing wasn't particularly happy.  Anyway, I hope she gets better soon, because we're having to give her a syringeful of medicine twice a day and she doesn't like the taste.  At all. We're having my nephew Caleb over this evening because his parents are going to Banbury with a German exchange group.  That's a new one.  But anyway, he's really sweet and we love him, so I'd better go because I think - possibly, maybe - he's coming soon. xx

      Well, a slightly more eventful day today. It started off boring, but then we got a big telling off for messing around on the buses on the way to the Junior site for Games.  We were being loud and signalling to the van behind us etc, nothing particularly terrible, but the driver complained which I can kind of understand.  Only now their terrible punishment is to ground us to the school for 2 lunchtimes - tomorrow and Monday.  The thing is those 2 lunchtimes are like our shortest ones, and practically none of us go out every single lunchtime a week anyway...  Also, they grounded our year and the year below, but the year below aren't allowed out anyway!!  Interesting. But it made us laugh, anyway.  Which I don't think is the point, but whatever. Oo, big event today, I actually watched (well ok, half watched half read) a whole game of football!  Which is doubly surprising seeing as how the match I watched was England playing, and I'm supporting Italy! ;) Anyway I'd better go now as its taken me an age to write this since I only had one hand as the other was holding the phone!!  Not my fault!! xx

      Which is probably not the best thing, really, if you intend to keep a blog.  But it has just taken me about half an hour to actually set our stupid computer up since it kept freezing.  Idiotic machine.  It thinks its so clever, sticking on me like that... Anyway. I got told today that I absolutely have to go to Southampton Sports Day next Wednesday, which is an event for about 5 Christian schools to compete together.  Well, OK, so they didn't say in as many words I CAN'T go, but my teacher was doing that 'it'd really bless me if you served in this way...' Basically, you're going so stuff it.  Although I only have to do Shot, so it'll only take about 10 minutes out of my whole day, so I get the whole day off to do not a lot, which is cool.  And we might be able to beat Basingstoke this year, as it really is our turn.  They're like our arch-enemy, by the way.  I practised all Games lesson today (well OK, all lesson I wasn't sunbathing or talking) and my best score so far is 7m60, which just for all of you who have no idea - in our school at least - is pretty good.  I was pleased, anyway. It was a gorgeous day today, consequently I spent all afternoon lazing around in the garden as it was so hot.  Although I only just managed to persuade Ben that a water fight really wasn't such a good idea, but it would have been OK, because Mum was on my side. Well, now that Sarah's sorted out my comment times, you can all say something to liven up this relatively boring post!! I shall look forward to reading what interesting lives you all lead in comparison to mine. xx

      Well, I finally got a blog of my own!! I figured as I'd started stealing my brother's constantly I really should start my own instead. Thank you very much to my sister Sarah who due to her blogging prowess set me up with this one.  You'd better read it now you told me to get it, is all I can say! I've been out looking in charity shops today for a costume for my friend's murder mystery party.  I'm a 'city slicker' sales rep and after various trips into Oxfam, Sue Ryder and Sobell House I EVENTUALLY found a light purple matching dress and jacket which is just perfect.  Hooray!  It did set me back £10 but I think for a suit its not that bad.  Now all I have to do is find numerous accesories to make the outfit just right... We had Biology in the courtyard at school today.  Its SOOOOOOO hot in that building, its horrendous.  Its alright for all you lucky adults and HE-ers, but for us poor school students stuck in a suffocating building... But luckily, due to the fact that we did our exams recently, we're getting no homework so all I have to do this evening is read and eat stupid amounts of chocolate that Mum and Dad got me from Germany over the weekend!  Yay! But now I'm going to fiddle around on my brand-spanking-new blog!! xx

      Well, this could be my last post before I go off to the first European destination of the year.&nbsp; In the early hours of Saturday morning - about 4ish - we're flying off to Poland for a week for  urlLink Euronet&nbsp;2004  - well, Euronet Poland 2004. We're also going to the France one a week later.  But tomorrow we're all going down to see the Clarke family in their new house, and Friday we'll all be  frantically packing!   Had a nice weekend, went to Hilary Gyde's birthday party on Saturday.&nbsp; We went bowling (and I won!&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; Despite having actually forgotten at the beginning how to throw the ball!) then had a barbecue afterwards, which was fun.&nbsp; We also interrogated Hilary's younger sister, which was also fun!  I stayed over at Amy Mason's that night, because Dad was speaking at a Chippy Churches together meeting in the afternoon.  On Monday we had a dentists appointment (Groan!&nbsp; I HATE dentists!&nbsp; I never used to mind until one time he drilled on a nerve - OWWWWWWWW!) but my teeth are fine!&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; After the dentists I went into Ottakars and persuaded Dad to buy me three new books for the holidays :)&nbsp; They were on a 3 for 2 deal though, and to be fair it will benefit him just as much as it will me!&nbsp; I got Grim Tuesday, Inkheart and The Book of Dead Days!&nbsp; Lovely titles, all 3.  I got bored in the afternoon, and became a  urlLink Friend of Felicity  and also joined the club at  urlLink EverythingGirl.com !&nbsp; Its really fun, actually.&nbsp; Well, I think its fun!  Yesterday evening we went to see Shrek 2.&nbsp; I'd finally managed to persuade Mum and Dad that it would be fun, and that they needed to pay because I have no money!!!&nbsp; They didn't mind that much, though.&nbsp; I thought it was very good, especially as it was a sequel, and really funny.  We have a nice lazy day today, I don't think anything is happening, so I'm just going to sit and read and play on Bust-a-Move 2, which I rediscovered 2 days ago, and now need -well OK, want - to complete.  So if I don't get to post again for a while, have a nice summer everyone!

       Yippee school is finished!!!  This morning was quite fun actually, first of all we just cleaned the school (OK - so that bit wasn't quite so fun!) and then we had a party in our family group, organised by yours truly in the absence of our tutor as he is off in Zambia with the former Y11s.&nbsp; But the party was really fun - big thanks to everyone who brought food or drink, and who participated in the games, although Chinese Laundry went a bit hectic at the end!! (I got them to bring me a person, as in carry someone else!)&nbsp; But then we had assembly, and said goodbye to 3 teachers - well, one helper but she's amazingly cool.&nbsp; She's called Renate and she's from Germany.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She helps because she's on a placement from Germany; and we all love her loads.&nbsp; We also said goodbye to 4 students, although 2 of them aren't quite sure if they're leaving or not yet.&nbsp; Then&nbsp; Harri and I - and other people from the other family groups - had to say what the highlights of our year in connection to family groups had been.&nbsp; Ours were winning the Family Group Netball Tournament and writing and producing plays and musicals for assemblies, most of them starring D Timms and Jamie Seggie.  Talking of Seggie, Sarah, in answer to your questions he was in our class but left last term to go to New Zealand, because his Dad's in the RAF.&nbsp; And Seggers because of his surname.&nbsp; Obviously.&nbsp; But he used to sing really high in our musicals, and he was up for doing whatever part we gave him so it was cool.&nbsp; He was Joseph/Danny in our production of the Nativity Grease style last time.&nbsp; It was very funny.&nbsp; We sang Donkey Lightning.  Also, Sarah, to answer your other question I&nbsp; meant when I was  FOUR , not  FOR !!&nbsp; Sorry for the confusion, and to anyone else who didn't understand.  Anyway, I'm going to leave and find some way to celebrate being off school - I would go into Oxford with some of my friends to watch Shrek 2, only I'm broke!! Hope you guys have a good time though.  I'VE FINISHED Y10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Yes, people, tomorrow is our last day of school!!!  Whoopee!! It actually doesn't feel like it at all, but I think that's due to a) 3 pieces of coursework being carried on until today (but now they're FINISHED!!) and b) the fact that our courses carry over to next year, and c) the fact that things like Prize Giving and Sports Day no longer excite me like they used to do when I was for. Also, apologies for not posting for AGES, but our internet's not working.  I have finally given up and am now using my dad's laptop. I spent my history lesson stuffing envelopes today, because King's are having a 20yrs reunion in September and they're not doing very well on the admin!!  Although it was more fun than FDR's New Deal, and plus (this is going to sound really sad) I actually quite like stuffing envelopes.  Its very therapeutic.  I'm really bored at the moment, probably because tonight's the first night in about 2 weeks when I haven't been frantically doing stats coursework.  However the fact that I'm bored does not mean I'm going to write a really long post, because I'm exhausted and have run out of inspiration for today.  It all got used up doing our Speaking and Listening Coursework for English today.  But we got our Creative Writing piece back and I got an A, which is cool. Anyway, I'll love and leave everyone, and Jamie I'm just about to add you to my links so don't worry!!

      Well, I'll catch up quickly before we go off again tomorrow - at 3am, AGAIN - to France this time. We had a really nice week in Poland. They have all these little nicknack stores and the stuff on them is really really cheap, which is cool. I bought 3 new bags and 2 new pairs of sandals - although the sandals were more of a necessity, really, because my feet were slowly being ripped to shreds in my old ones. I also got some really nice jewellery; a ring and 2 necklaces. We were going round some unpronouncable town one day when we came to this stall selling DVDs. They were pretty much definitely pirated, but they're good quality pirated, and Dad bought Spiderman 2 for 5 pounds, which I think is pretty lucky because I'd been planning to go to the cinema and see it for that amount! Our Uncle Tom, who was there as well, bought Troy, so I stole it off him and watched it on Dad's laptop because that was another I hadn't got around to seeing in the cinema. Only that one showed more that it was a dodgy copy, because at the beginning when they have the brief history thing (which I presume when you have it on the English setting should be in English) it was all in French. Which was weird. Anyway, the meetings were good too, but very loud. The Poles don't seem to be able to manage quiet worship. But hey, its fun. So that was last week, and then next week we're at Euronet France, then on holiday for 2 more weeks. I don't know when I'll be able to post again, if I can I'll try on Dad's laptop, but  au revoir  for now! (See - I'm in French mode already!!!)
