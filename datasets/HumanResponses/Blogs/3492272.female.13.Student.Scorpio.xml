      I had to write this for some reason so here it goes... I wanted to get my hair trimmed not even 2 inches and my mom said she couldn't do it so I was like never mind then my dad said he would do it... OH - NO... But I said only an inch and he was like I know I know and then I was Like have you ever cut some ones hair before and he was like yea.. Well All I have to say is never let a guy cut your hair.... When he was almost don't I touched my hair and It felt like it was all gone.. So I looked in the mirror and It was WICKED short!!!!! O-well I'll adjust sooner or la8ter.. WEll I got to go think of what I can do to make it look good..~XOXOXO~.. **MEGZ**

      "A girL asked her boy friend if he thought she was pretty and he said no then she asked him if he liked her and he said no so then she asked him if he wanted her and he again said no so she said would u cry if I walked away and He said no again well she heard enough so she started to cry and walked away and as she did he grabed her arm and said" I dont think your pretty I think your beautiful. And I dont like you I love you." I dont want you I need you" and I Wouldnt cry If you Walked Away I woulD die "   ....." My new Best Friend".....   Today I met a great new friend  Who knew me right away  It was funny how she understood  All I had to say   She listened To my problems  She listened to my dreams  We talked about love and life  She's been there too, it seems   I never once felt judged by her  she knew just how I felt  She seemed to just accpet me  And all the problems I'd been dealt   She didn't interrupt me  Or need to have her say  She Just listened very patiently  And didn't go away   I wanted her to understand  how much this meant to me  But as I went to hug her  Something startled me   I put my arms in front of me  And went to pull her nearer  And realize my new best friend  Was nothing but a mirror.   And I luv u more with every breath i'll be yours from now until death.  I hate u because u made me luv u but u were not here to luv me back because u were to busy luving her.  ~*~I didn't mean to hurt you, But your sexy when you cry Maybe I really loved you, HaHa!!! Aren't I cute when I lie??  Mirrors don't talk and lucky for you they don't laugh!   u had betta take some sleeping pills baby....cuz the only place ull get me is in ur dreamz!  *~ Rose's Are Red ~*~ Violets Are Blue~*~ The Sun Is Hot ~*~ And So Are U ~*  Girls are like phones, we like to be held and talked too, but if u press the wrong button u'll be disconnected!  One day your prince will come, mine just took a wrong turn, got lost, and is to stubborn to ask for directions   FOR ALL OF YOU WHO TALK ABOUT ME THANKS FOR MAKING ME THE CENTER OF YOUR WORLD!!!!!  If U Want Me To Fall 4 U... U Gotta Give Me Sumthin Worth Trippin Ova!!  Friends are like elevator buttons, they can either take you up or bring you down, choose wisely.  Life isn't a garden...so stop being a hoe!!!    ~When a guy tells u to suck it turn around and say...its dangerous to have small objects in my mouth~    "People say that Love is giving someone the ability to destroy you, but trusting them not to. If you really love me tell me what I want to hear, but those other words are what I fear. If you really love me, would you stand by my side? Would you care for me? Be there for me? Be there when I cry? Don't tell me you love me when you have someone else on your mind. Don't tell me you want me when you have someone else by your side. I really don't wanna hear it, because you'll break my heart. Don't try to fix what is broken. Don't even start. If you didn't notice...I've been in luv with u from the start  Boys are like taxi's whenever you need them their not there, whenever you don't their everywhere!!!!!   Life is like a snow storm….you’ll meet a lot of flakes!   ~!~Dont Piss me Off Becuz I aM rUnnIng Out of Places To Hind Da Bodies~!~  You Can Think Ur Prettier than Me..Its Okay to Lie to Yourself Every once in awhile!!  It's not called showing off, it's called you being mad because you can't do it!   Frustrated Cuz I Cant Tell If It*S Real Mad Cuz I Don*t no How u Feel Upset Cuz We Can*t Make it Right Sad Cuz I Need U Day & Nite Angry Cuz U Won’t Take My Hand Aggravated Cuz U Don*t Understand Disappointed Cuz We Can*t B 2GeThA But Still i*LL love U 4eVa*~   Should I smile cuz we’re friends, or cry cuz that’s all we’ll ever be?   Don’t worry about what people say about you cuz it cant be as bad as what you think about them.  u kno what? u need to call 1-800 get-a-life and stop revolving around mine!  ~*u DoNt DeSeRvE Me I KnOw ThAt ItS TrUe, bUt I WaNt u So bAd.. WuT Do I Do*~  ~Sometimes we must get hurt in order to grow; we must fail in order to know,  Sometimes our vision clear only after our eyes are washed away with tears.  hE lUVs Me LUvS mE nOt, If He DoEsNt He JuSt BrOkE mY hEaRt!!  My heart is lost~ im off 2 find it, once i do, i gotta bind it, cuz if i dont then it'll be a mess my luv 4 u will pour out and then there'd b less..

It's ok to kiss a fool, It's ok to let a fool kiss you, But never let a kiss fool you...  *Its not like I wanted to be the one holding your hand...I just didn't want her holding it...*  DON'T FOLLOW MY FOOTSTEPS....I WALK INTO WALLS!!  ~!*~!*~!*its funny how a heart is two tear drops upside down~!*~!*~!*

      IM 13 Years old and my name is Megan. I live in new Hampshire.... Some times I wonder if life is worth living.. I don't know why but nothing seems to make me happy any more.. I don't really have a "LIFE" so usually I read or write poems or play my guitar... That and school takes up most of my time.. My 20 year old sister Becky is having a baby boy in July so IM going to be an Auntie.. So that's some thing for me to look forward to.. I have friends but I don't really talk to them much outside of school.. IM not in to the whole gossip shit unless some thing really bad is said about me or about some one I really care about... I have learned a lot in my life this year... The most important thing I learned is not to get my hopes up because when what you were hoping for doesn't happen it makes you feel so hurt inside because you wait for some thing that some one promises and then they let you down.. So now I am really care full and I don't get my hopes up because I don't want to be let down again.... Also I learned that the people closest to you are the ones who hurt you they most... Never trust some one a lot because in the end they will probably lie to you and then that hurts you a lot...well la8ta..
