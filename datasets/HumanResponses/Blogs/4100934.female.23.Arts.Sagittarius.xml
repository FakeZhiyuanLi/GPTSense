      For the first time in my life I am realizing how little I am. Not only am I vertically challenged, but I just  feel  small. When I was a child, I associated growing with "growing up." Now that I'm done growing (physically) I associate growth with realizing how insignificant I really am.  Is this what is known as "maturity?" I think maybe so. I attribute this epiphany to my increasing awareness of world and political events. To put it bluntly:  there's a whole lot of seriously fucked-up shit going down and there isn't much that I can do about it.  Before, I just accepted it and never questioned. Now, I think, "WHY???"  Maybe there  is  something I can do. What? I wish I knew. Maybe, one day, I will find something that I can do.  Sometimes, I feel scared. I have these moments where I realize how completely alone I am in the world. I have friends. I have wonderful friends and wonderful family. I feel so loved.   I'm not sure if I love them as much as they love me. I mean, I do love them, but they love me a  lot . They never give up on me.  But even knowing that, there is still this sense that I'm really just alone. There isn't anyone that completely knows what's going on in my little head except for me.  This scares me. I'm the type that wants a person to completely know me.  It doesn't matter how much I let them in on--- it never feels like enough.    I attribute all of the above to my lack of faith in God. Many people pray.  God supposedly knows everything about you and then some, so in theory, from conception to death, you are never truly alone.  I'm way too skeptical right now to accept the existence of God, or at least the existence of a God that actually listens to us in the way that another person does when we confide in them. I wish I could believe this idea, but I just don't.  So, yeah...little me.

      Something I've learned that I think is worth sharing here:  Relationships evolve. You can't force a relationship to be what you want it to be, and sometimes, you think a relationship is something that it isn't. When you give your love, trust, and honestly to someone, that doesn't automatically mean that they can give it back. Sometimes, it's not even personal. If there is a lot at stake, sometimes, they simply can't do it even though they do care about you. This realization is hard to cope with. It's very disappointing, hurtful, and embarrassing, but for big-hearted people it just comes with the territory.  Another thing to consider: You can either pine for the friends you  wish  you had, or you can appreciate the ones you  know  you have.  I also wonder sometimes if trust and honesty in a relationship doesn't just happen in its own time. In relationships where I truly feel that I can trust a person and that we are both very honest with each other, I don't really think about the fact that this honesty and trust is present. I don't even remember the day when I realized that we have trust and honesty; it just snuck in somewhere. I think it automatically happens when you are both ready for it. Forcing it can cause a lot of pain, guilt, and even more distrust than would normally exist. I think that being angry with someone for not completely trusting you is a huge mistake because then they will probably never be able to trust you completely, even though they might really love you and want to be able to.  Man, the older I get, the more I hurt. It  sucks.
