         sooooo, i was at my apartment and randomly frank knocked on the door and said that i had to go with him because we were meeting crissi, jose, jake, mandy, carrie etc etc. at this pond/swamp/river/lake thing. so i jumped up and got ready and ran 14 miles with frank to the pond place. we had to climb through some bushes, buildings and rooftops to get to the "special" pond. when we arrived everyone was swimming with alligators, crocodiles, worms, fish, tadpoles and etc. i was scared shitless but eventually i jumped in when jose said " you're not down" so i had to prove him wrong. everyone was having a grand time and the cool thing to do in this pond was try to get a worm to wrap aound your neck to be a necklace. i was the only one who succeeded at the task. all of a sudden, frank freaked out and said i had to go with him and we had to run back to his house for a minute. being the dumb girl i am, i said "ok." so we ran back to his house only to change his son's diaper. AAAAAAHHHHHHHH.. oh god!!!!!!! then he was freaking out about why he wasn't making any interest on his well fargo bank account since he was writing over 400 checks a month. what the fuck?!?!?! so needless to say, we went back to the pond and on the way we brought his son and frank asked me to be his baby's momma. i nearly died but said yes to him.       it was at this precise moment i woke up in a panic this morning. what the hell am i dreaming about. i make myself nervous.      in other news, my dad came this past weekend and took everything i own besides my t.v., computer, some clothes and some bathroom products. my apaprtment is bare. i am wuite nervous about moving home and will miss my independence in davis tremendously. i honestly think that i enjoyed my time in davis. it was rough in the beginning but it got easier with time. i am sooo fournatute to have parents like mine who supported and semi-paid for me to be here. i look forward to being closer to my friends in murrieta. and hope that the hotties come out where every they live and show their faces to me so i don't have to dream about resorting to be someone's baby momma.       i hope all goes well with my move back to so cal, it will be a big change for me and i just keep praying that my family will get better with time and my dad finds the strength to hold on each day. i love you all and hope you have a great day!!
