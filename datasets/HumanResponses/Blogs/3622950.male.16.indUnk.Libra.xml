      while watching Uprising on Channel 9 the other day .. i was confronted with a very good quote "how can a moral man with moral values live in a immoral world?" .. and i pondered .. yes i pondered on this very quote .. after seeing the man burn himself to death protecting his family and friends .. and today i confronted the same question also .. it happened in Religion .. we were given excercises to do .. and my groups question was something like this:  Pia and Sally are best of friends, Pia and her husband have just found out that they could not conceive a child, in that Pia was infertile .. now .. Sally herself is happily married with 3 children, a loving husband and in good shape .. Pia out of no where asks Sally to be a surrogate mother .. Sally knowing that this could bring joy to Pia and her husband .. is confronted with a dilemma..   My own morals and stuff .. say that Sally should say no .. i mean we have seen cases where the surrogate mother becomes attached to the unborn child, as well as the fact that the surrogate mother could also have feelings for her best friends' husband .. i mean there are many dilemma's .. so to save much hurt and pain .. the best option would be no.. right? .. what are your thoughts?  Im feeling a bit moralistic today so please share

       Arguably one of the best running backs to every set his foot on a Football field has announced his retirement. Ricky Williams has told his team today (25th July 2004) that he will retire before the season commences  urlLink (click here for interview)  . This is a devasting blow to the Miami Dolphins, Ricky Williams was there spine, and without him the same fate might fall upon them as it did Oakland Raiders in 2003 (4 - 12). 3 Years ago Ricky Williams was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, and also came 'out of the closet' in that year about his ordeal as well, if you have ever seen him in an interview after a game, he would always wear his vizor/helmet on, this was due to his disorder. All i can say is at least he ended it on his own terms, he gave it his all and when he couldnt he retired for the team.

      "You know the world is going crazy when the best rapper is a white guy, the best golfer is a black guy, and the tallest guy in the NBA is Chinese.  The Swiss hold the America's Cup, France is accusing the U.S. of arrogance, Germany doesn't want to go to war, and the three most powerful men in America are named 'Bush', 'Dick' and 'Colon.' Need I say more?" -Chris Rock  hehhehe thought i would share it with u ppl :D

      Well today i opened up the Sunday Times, and lo behold i find a section called STM, and who should be on the cover .. none other then Keira Knightley (the new KK), she is to rival  urlLink dan's  KK (Kristen Kreuk) .. or so i think, the hottest 19 year old to be exported out of Britain. Well good for her, it is time she was taken into the limelight to be recognised by all of hollywood, the stunt actions she does are to die for, or so i am told, this had reignited my desire to watch King Arthur, all that are interested please email me at raidersboi@gmail.com. if you are interested in coming to watch it with me.  Here are some interesting links of KK  urlLink kkwavefront.com   urlLink www.keiraknightleypalace.com/   tell me what you think of her.

      As some of you might know, my Grandmother passed away on Friday the 30th of August 2004. In rememberance of her, i found these poem very comforting and would like to share it with you, although i dont like anyone to really know this piece of information, ill share with you these two poems.  The parting came so suddenly, We'll always wonder why. The hardest part of all was We never said goodbye.  ------------------------------  God closed your eyes to ease the pain, To wish you back would be in cain. You suffered so much, you told so few. You did not deserve what you went through. Tired and weary, you made no fuss, But tried to hard to stay with ys.  Peace everyone, till next time i post.
