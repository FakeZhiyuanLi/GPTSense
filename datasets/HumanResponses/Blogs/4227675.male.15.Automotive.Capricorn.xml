        Bored, so, again, why not post. Not alot really happend. Went to my grandparents 50th wedding anniversary Sunday. You'd think after 50 years of being married they would have something INTERESTING to say. But no, not MY family. Boring stuff there. Then I test drove the Camaro that I'm trying to buy. Fun shit there. My brothers eyes were so huge when I was peeling out and stuff. I loved every second of it, trust me. Then sunday night until tonight, tuesday, I was in south lyon at my uncles house. Worked my ass off but he bought my hungting license and all my tags so that saved me $75.00 so I guess I cant complain. Came home and talked to shelbz about some people for awhile, nothing better to do. Trying to figure out where Brandon is, I think he's at his moms which sucks cuz I have the next two days off with nothing to do, and Ralph moved/is moving so cant go there. Oh well, two days of rest I guess. More in a couple days. I dont do enough in a day to post daily :)

       Well, there's nobody online to talk to. So I figure, mise well talk to myself. I've seen a few of these things around and It's always interesting to see what other people do. Not saying that I'm all that interesting, but, oh well.       Today not alot happend. Woke up, played Nascar Thunder 2004 for a few minutes. Short attention span, so that didnt last long. Me and phish went outside and I threw the ball for him for about an hour. Then Ralph called and I went to his house and we just fucked around. We walked up to spads and hung out with Brady Crights and Eric...uhh I forgot his last name. Oh well. Went to McDonalds for dinner cuz dad was to lazy to make something....Now I'm here. Sitting on the computer...Talking to myself. Anyways, I guess that's all for now. Peace.      Casey~

         Bored, so why not post again. Nothing exciting going on. Went to my grandparents 50th wedding anniversary sunday, that was worse then getting teeth pulled. Spend monday and most of tuesday at the uncle's house. May move in there after school starts, we'll see. Already have my own room and bathroom there, plus a dresser full of clothes that are mine. So, it's worth looking into. New school, but, hey why not. Tomorrow hanging out with some people got lucky and have thursday off too. Who knows what Ill do. More later.
