      Well this weekend has been nicely lazy. Slept in until 10 (wow really late for me) on sat. Then Drew and I went on a nice run together, he did calisthenics while I did a track workout. Then, not wanting to stay indoors even though it was pretty miserable outside, we decided to go to innerharbor and check out the science museum. I must say, I have no idea how Baltimore keeps that science museum open! It was $14 per-person, for a whole lot of nothing! I think that whole museum could fit into the Boston museum's front entrance. Plus, we are so close to D.C. and their museums are free. We encountered a few surprised tourists who had clearly come up from DC for the day, they didn't realize you had to pay for this museum. We tried to take our time in the museum, and ended up spending about an hour there. When we left the sun had come out, and the humidity had lowered considerably. All in all it ended up being a really nice evening and we walked around for several hours. I usually am not a fan of Baltimore city (surprise surprise) but I figured living so close, I should go in at least once this summer....so my quota has been filled for the summer :) Today has been pretty relaxed as well, ran errands, sat by the pool for a tad, and watched the women's Olympic marathon. I am always so amazed at those women, wow! Talk about mental and physical tenacity! In the time I run 17 miles, they were almost done with the whole marathon! Pretty nuts if you ask me. I keep saying I will run a marathon someday...guess I'm going to try to get through my first 1/2 marathon before then. Sept 5th! I'll be in Virginia Beach, running my first!! :)

      So I've been watching the Olympic coverage on  Good Morning America  lately and this morning I had it on mute reading the subtitles that they type, when I realized that almost every other word was mispelled.  Now having the mom I have this discovery greatly annoyed me.  How can you have a job where you can't even spell what you already know is going to be said because they all read from scripts up on a teleprompter.  Talk about not doing your job well.  This is seen by millions of viewers everyday, no one complains??  I swear, I only faux finish walls and if there is one tiny little error people will refuse to pay us.  Sometimes I feel like these housewives really need to get a life.  My boss has had so many checks bounce due to these women deciding not to honor the payment contracts because there was "a tiny little spot I saw when i was way up on a 15 foot ladder cleaning the window.....I know no one can see it unless they got up on the ladder, but I'm not going to pay you on completion of the project until its taken care of."  And of course, they don't always tell us, so we write a check assuming they paid up, and theres not enough money in the bank account....oh wow, oops random tangent. This has def. made me not want to become a housewife...ever!  I see so many women that just don't do  anything all day long!   How can one function like that? No wonder all those women are on prozac and wellbutrin, if I sat on my ass day in and day out without leaving or anything I'd  have to be heavily medicated too, talk about boredom and lack of feeling needed or useful..... I mean, not to say that I'm not thankful for my mom staying home and raising us, but she was busy, she didn't plant herself infront of the tv for hours.  Last week I worked at a house, it was a very large job, and it took 2 wks to do.  I learned her routine really well, this house had 4 people in it...husband, wife, 2 kids under the age of 8.  They owned 10 TV's.....?! Thats more than 2 per person?! What do you need a tv in every room of your house for?  The woman would get up when we got there at 9, watch those morning shows, then the View, then The Nanny, then some fashion tv, and on and on until 11:30 when she'd finally get dressed.  She'd meet someone for lunch and shopping and be back at 2, to return to the tv again.  At least it was sort of entertainment for me while I was working alone, better than quite.  But can we say get a job, maybe a hobby?! Anyway, I am completely off topic now....Speaking of getting a hobby, I need to go paint now :)

      Well I had a sucessful day on the treadmill today.  I woke up today, and as usual, went to ice my shin, and the bump on the anterior shin muscle is almost gone.  No pain either.  I iced anyway, and took some advil just incase then went down to the treadmill to test it out.  Its way too hilly around here for me to run outside, so that was a bit of a downer, but i could keep a moderate pace on the treadmill for about an hr with no pain, so it seems as though I will be able to run in the 1/2 marathon afterall!!!  Yippee!!  I guess I was getting a bit too over-zealous about training, I wanted to finish with a really good time, but now I just want to be able to run the whole thing without doing any real damage to my leg. Anyway, just wanted to share my news :) hehehehe Keep my fingers crossed!!

      So I have been reading From Beruit to Jerusalem, by Thomas Friedman, while biking lately...and it has been making me think alot lately.....I tend not to be a very political person, I'm not registered to vote (technically I'm still a resident of MA even tho i have been living in MD for over a yr now) Its long and complicated....and very expensive to become a citizen of MD, so I havent bothered...yet. I think I'm in denial that I live here, Drew and I keep talking about moving somewhere nicer (CA, TX, AZ....see a westwardly trend?)  Anyway, I'm getting off the subject here..... So living with Drew and how he feels about staying current with politics etc has gotten me more interested in politics.  Plus when you add in the upcoming election, and all the things happening in the world right now its hard not to be.  Usually I try to not think about politics becuase it is pretty frustrating, I mean really, what can we do as individuals....lets be honest, no "great" politican is going to run for president any time soon.  It seems like this election is going to whomever is the lesser of the 2 evils.  I mean Bush is, well hes Bush...can't speak well, and as a representation of the US hes kinda embarrassing to me.....I don't want the rest of the world thinking that we are all bad orators, and cowboys.  But also with that said, I'm not sure how much better Kerry would be, he is afterall a politican.  Here is my problem, if there was no war going on, I would totally be for Kerry, however, we hav def stuck our noses into an ugly one at the moment.  And Bush is more of a "war" president....However, I'm not sure that we will ever quite get out of what we have gotten into.  People my age living in the middle east do not know what life without fighting is like. Its a way of life for them, losing friends, relatives, and neighbors is a way of life and they seem to have become somewhat complacent with it.  They don't strive for education, or the future, they go on suicide missions instead.  With that said, our troops are not prepared to win a war like that.  Many of them are trying to start families, or become educated.  Their purpose in life is not to fight, its to live.  They have many other things on their minds, and honestly, that is their weakness as far as this war is concerned.  It seems more like the only way to win this war is to nuke them all....or just for us to admit that we dont belong and get the heck out...which isnt going to happen....so maybe Bush and his cowboy was might be the best......But then again I think i like Kerry better, maybe we just need someone new, let someone else give the presidency a try. I would rather it be peaceful, and have Kerry as a president, however, as long as we are at war maybe we need puppet-Bush.  But then again there is all his ties to oil companies here and there....ahh its dizzying thinking about all this.... Anyway, I think its time for me to end my rambling...time for me to go put away some laundry, maybe watch some olympics.  Actually I think this is the first time I have really watched the olympics (again Drew's influence)

      Ok, this it probably going to be a short blog.  I tried doing this lastnight, but it was 12 (which is very unusually late for me) and it didnt work, so I didn't bother trying to retype it again. As you all know, running is life, life is running (according to me) and for the last week I haven't been able to because I injured my ankle/shin.  This really upsets me for 2 reasons, the main one is because in 3 wks I'm supposed to run my first 1/2 marathon, and paid $60 to enter it and more to stay at the hotel etc...and 2, well just because (according to me) running is life :)  Fortunately we have stationary bikes in our little workout gym downstairs, so at least I feel like I have sort of been able to stay inshape, just incase I can actually run in the 1/2 marathon. So soon, I will be headinging downstairs to hop on the bike that takes me nowhere...sigh...I miss being outside, its a  beautiful  day!!    I think Drew and I will kayak today tho, so that will be nice anyway....
