      there were words, so many words, they rushed to escape, but as they reached the exit, they understood. they would never reach the outside, they would never feel the air and no one would ever feel them. they returned, but not to the old order, to the order that they had newly formed. they went to the back, never tried to escape again.

      i wrote some short texts, theorems on feelings i called them. now they are lost in a notebook somewhere. they must be rediscovered.   rediscovery is something that i appreciate as much as discovery, but in an entirely different way.   the day passes by. c'est tout.

      m'a toujours fasciné...  i always wanted to spend a lengthy amount of time researching this topic. hate the sentiment, which sometimes grows and sometimes we repress. that which is not polite to express, but sometimes a driving force. i read a wonderful psychology journal which i used for a project. it was dedicated to hate that one issue. the texts were far more literary than scientific. some where about hate under the umbrella of discrimination, but some were purely about the sentiment that overcomes at certain intervals; hearing the sound of someone near by when one expects to be alone. an invasion.   1: intense hostility and aversion usually deriving from fear, anger, or sense of injury  2: extreme dislike or antipathy

      À une Mendiante rousse  Blanche fille aux cheveux roux, Dont la robe par ses trous Laisse voir la pauvreté Et la beauté,  Pour moi, poète chétif, Ton jeune corps maladif, Plein de taches de rousseur, A sa douceur.  Tu portes plus galamment Qu'une reine de roman Ses cothurnes de velours Tes sabots lourds.  Au lieu d'un haillon trop court, Qu'un superbe habit de cour Traîne à plis bruyants et longs Sur tes talons ;  En place de bas troués, Que pour les yeux des roués Sur ta jambe un poignard d'or Reluise encor ;  Que des noeuds mal attachés Dévoilent pour nos péchés Tes deux beaux seins, radieux Comme des yeux ;  Que pour te déshabiller Tes bras se fassent prier Et chassent à coups mutins Les doigts lutins,  Perles de la plus belle eau, Sonnets de maître Belleau Par tes galants mis aux fers Sans cesse offerts,  Valetaille de rimeurs Te dédiant leurs primeurs Et contemplant ton soulier Sous l'escalier,  Maint page épris du hasard, Maint seigneur et maint Ronsard Épieraient pour le déduit Ton frais réduit !  Tu compterais dans tes lits Plus de baisers que de lis Et rangerais sous tes lois Plus d'un Valois !  - Cependant tu vas gueusant Quelque vieux débris gisant Au seuil de quelque Véfour De carrefour ;  Tu vas lorgnant en dessous Des bijoux de vingt-neuf sous Dont je ne puis, oh ! pardon ! Te faire don.  Va donc ! sans autre ornement, Parfum, perles, diamant, Que ta maigre nudité, Ô ma beauté !  Charles Baudelaire

      i write here now.   Reading Lautréamont, coming to terms with growth, decisions, oneself, truth. every obstacle is placed in your way, one after another, but between each one a new chance, a new smile.   "Lecteur, c'est peut-être la haine que tu veux que j'invoque dans le commencement de cet ouvrage! Qui te dit que tu n'en renifleras pas, baigné dans d'innombrables voluptés, tant que tu voudras, avec tes narines orgueilleuses, larges et maigres, en te renversant de ventre, pareil à un requin, dans l'air beau et noir, comme si tu comprenais l'importance de cet acte et l'importance non moindre de ton appétit légitime, lentement et majestueusement, les rouges émanations? Je t'assure, elles réjouiront les deux trous informes de ton museau hideux, ô monstre, si toutefois tu t'appliques auparavant à respirer trois mille fois de suite la conscience maudite de l'Éternel! Tes narines, qui seront démesurément dilatées de contentement ineffable, d'extase immobile, ne demanderont pas quelque chose de meilleur à l'espace, devenu embaumé comme de parfums et d'encens; car, elles seront rassasiées d'un bonheur complet, comme les anges qui habitent dans la magnificence et la paix des agréables cieux." - Lautréamont    urlLink Maldoror    urlLink Plan de la Ville Montevideo

      what i'm thinking about today, i guess mostly that i wish i was more confident with my life and in my own skin. there has been so much going on lately that it's made me more scared than i should ever be. it's not right to be constantly scared, rather than living and experiencing things.

      the world girl and woman, not just in english, but in all the languages i know. though i prefer girl, fille, etc. for some reason i can't imagine feeling this way in my skin. i can't feel right in my skin and the discomfort in itself creates further discomfort. being a girl isn't a new experience, not since yesterday or the day before, it's not like attending a new school, or meeting a new friend, it is a part of me and one i cannot face, one that makes me sigh, and breathe heavily and not comprehend.

      1: hostility toward a rival or one believed to enjoy an advantage    how it does affect one even when it is fought against. the grass certainly seems to always be greener on the other side, though on further research the truth is that it's never the imagined green.     i have often moments of wondering: why me? why have i been left behind? why haven't i achieved or figured out solutions if others have? why has x figured things out?     on further thought there is no clone of me out there and therefore no one doing exactly what i want to be doing even if i am often confused. and then the green monster fades away again, until the next time it rears it's little head in.

      the ability to demand.     concluded as a consequence to a conversation with a friend. i wasn't able to process it when the conversation took place, but as i've been able to chew on it a bit, it is quite true, dissapointingly so.     i MUST learn it. it is quite obvious that i can't go in the direction that i want without truly fighting, and part of that is a good offensive, a strategy.

      thoughts on the matter of marketed identities    this specifically addressed at the 'networking' profile websites where one makes lists of lists and then lists of those lists, everything kept as much on the surface as possible.     mana for the masses, the privileged masses that is.     thoughts related:     1. the marketing of identity is equal to the objectification going on in a magazine like playboy and in terms of meaning and potential to change the world is rather similar.     2. you can get so caught up in this creation of identity (which you believe is true) that you lose whatever you had in the first place.    3. the wish to have an identity to feel clear about it, it's human nature, to take it to an extreme, that erases human nature, and erases the possibility of conversation is what i think of as marketing one's identity.     4. it is about supply and demand (in terms of identity), it says something about world-order.    5. fabrication is easier than thought.    6. reappearance of "irony" as a way to make fun of anyone who has less, is less in terms of world order.    i find it heavily disturbing in terms of collective psychology (which i am not a huge fan of to begin with), or as a cultural phenomenon; a definite/ limitted structure which creates nothing and is equal to manually killing braincells while rejecting absolutely any kind of meaning/ action/ creation. the fact that someone can reject any form of meaning and action not just in their own lives but in the lives of others, that is a PROBLEM when the world is going in the direction that it is.

      to add a few more words.     too much loudness coming in from the street. i can clearly hear someone's phone conversation which i would assume he would want to keep private. but he is making it impossible on himself. gone...    but i had meant to return to my previous thought the marketing of one's own identity. let me of course add that the majority of the world does not have this luxury, but i will focus on the westerners just now. why do we make it so easy to get boxed in?     the fight for freedom is replaced by the fight to have a "cooler" profile. we take the pre-made categories, the pre-made products, the pre-made words and only choose from those to define ourselves. rebellion has been replaced by appropriation of various serious issues in order to make fun of them.     when nothing is taken seriously anymore, when meaning is lost, is the world really going in the right direction?

      sleep. i've been terribly tense the past few days. i'm very slowly allowing my body to recover from everything. i never expected that i could have such acute reactions to anything, to life, to the world, to myself, and most of all to stress. i guess i just figured my mind could get overwhelmed on its own and my body would keep on as if nothing had happened. i have now learned otherwise. so it's a step at a time now.

      when i must give a second thought, a re-thought to everything that i have already thought. dreams are rather worthless without a fight, and so our thoughts and ideas.   i lived today wondering what i have really been doing what i have really done with my life thus far. not a long life, but then i wasn't born with a contract and termination date, all i know is that there will be a one and i can't possibly spend my time feeling terribly unhappy, when there is so little of it anyways.   i spent some time away from the computer this weekend, more than i usually spend away, i needed it. i looked at picture after picture wondering what it all meant, wondering where my hope would come from or how i could transform it into reality. i think the time away helped actually. i listened to Bach (my meditation music) and felt at peace and then i watched far too much tv, probably enough to enduce one bad headache.   about dreams, mine sometimes don't touch reality, i won't even let them, there is no fear if they only live inside of me, but i cannot continue like this. life is about being real, not about what is strictly in my head. i have to allow it to develop, i must fight for things, i must regain my energy, i must not allow the way things are to continue. and certainly, fear is not an emotion that can be a guiding light, i can't allow myself to forget, myself, or others.   so i sigh and take a deep breath and understand things again, or at least try to understand them once.   and then i wonder why i can't sleep at night, or at least not properly. but the hours add up. 5 instead of 8, and 5 instead of 8 again, time to sleep more than usual.

      this week.   a good moment for analysis of why my relationships within somewhat defined contexts (where there are groups of people) suck.   i am bad at expressing myself in groups, or even standing up for what i really believe, not to mean that i am not indeed very opinionated, but i monitor myself, maybe compromise (myself) more often than i should, maybe i don't actually feel safe even in the 'safe spaces.'   constantly criticizing others (in my head) and feeling constantly criticized (in my head).   i don't feel i am so extreme (in my views) though i'm sure some must see me that way, but i find it hard to find 'safe spaces.' usually rather impossible in fact. the designated ones have never felt quite what i imagined/hoped them to be, not their failure, mine.   i find it impossible to accept a lot of what is really just part of being human, i am the last person to truly take in human nature, and maybe that is where my discomfort comes from. i also have noted enough differences so as to make it impossible for me to fully convince myself that indeed there is a reason for me to feel accepted or otherwise.   i am tired of emotional binges, or of emotional falsities. maybe i am too calculated, but i don't think i am, i am just all or nothing, it eliminates quite a few things (amongst which is tolerance for empty laughs, words, sarcasm and people).

      is fear.  the arrogance of others is a great point of anger for me. could i tear my arrogance apart though? i definitely must say that arrogance is borne from reactions to what one receives from the outside. i don't really see it as inherent in human nature. i see it as inherent only when it is stirred.   for example if one kicks a rock it might fall, but the rock could very easily sit there forever otherwise and never fall. arrogance is much like that for me. it is a shield, but sometimes the shield turns into a sword, and attacks others that i find it intolerable.   but why does one need a shield to begin with? because its all about competition. because even when you think you are outside the system you are still competing within it. survival in the current system is based on competition, it is not based on owning up to one's weaknesses, it is about destroying someone else whether it be through directly exploiting/pointing out their weaknesses or whether it might be through exaggerating one's strengths and uniqueness. the feeling must constantly be there that there is someone above and someone below.   the alternative cannot be born from a vertical line with a beginning and an end, it must come from infinitely many horizontal planes, with no end and no beginning.

      for a woman artist to make a painting of a sexualized woman for it to be filled with meaning? for it to actually become a political, empowered object? is it really enough just for that to happen? i can't think so. i can't feel so when it is all product, product after product. women create products just as much men do, even using themselves as the object.

      c'est nous qui nous tuons avec notre superficialité.   it is the empty words in this world that kill me. the words of arrogance, ignorant words so easy to say, sometimes about important things sometimes about simple things. i can't deal with the wasted moments on triviality, not moments of relaxation (that is not trivial), but moments of waste... creating trash with the air we breathe, the words we speak and write. that is triviality, triviality of the worst kind...  you can tolerate war, but you cannot tolerate the fact that someone doesn't have the access you do. that is superficial!

      in my search for somewhat inspiring texts i went to the bookstore. there was an ambulance and 2 police cars outside, people watching through the window and all attention of those in the bookstore focusing on one area.  i stepped in, soon after a young man had attempted suicide. the situation seemed complicated (apart from the attempted suicide which seemed to be a call for attention since they held him in the store for about 30 minutes so the emergency couldn't've been that great). from what i gathered from all the whispers he had shop-lifted something, the police had been called, then he had slashed his wrists.  at first i didn't know about the attempted suicide, the man was standing up, he was hand cuffed. some minutes later when i looked again he was sitting on an ambulance chair type thing and they were patching up his bleeding wrists, i could see the blood. i kept on looking for some books fruitlessly, aimlessly, but gave up eventually. i heard some screaming that he didn't want to go to jail, but i left the bookstore, i didn't want to wait around. i didn't know how to feel in the face of this very personal, impersonal act. i was cold towards the situation. eventually i went in search of a specific kind of chocolate cake which was nowhere to be found.  i returned to the bookstore about 20 minutes later, this time they were all getting ready to leave, the man was in the ambulance, door was open, he seemed sedated, i couldn't look him in the eye, not that i should've expected otherwise.  i feel numb, as i was in the bookstore an older man told me "don't do what that guy did!"(or something to that extent) i'm not sure what i should interpret that as, but i found it a rather odd, misplaced statement from a stranger.  and the day goes on

      to keep on coming out, though i suppose on a day like today it is all as a release, certainly more thoughts will follow, more questions, but today this is just my space, the space inside of me reflected on this screen in these words.  i'm trying to think of a way to lead my life that won't cause me so much damage, that won't include so much sabotage, senseless, self-destructive sabotage. not an easy plan to come up with. i just want to overhaul.

      i stand on the edge, like those rocks on the edge of the sea, or of the land, depending on how one looks at it. so i guess i stand in the middle, on the edge of 2 things, but not on the outside. it's funny how one can stand in the middle and feel entirely on the edge, and maybe the feeling isn't so bad if one learns to accept it within, to love it within. maybe things can't always be the way we are taught to wish they should be. in fact i have already learned that lesson from experience, but it seems i have yet to come to terms with it in my behavior.

      maybe?!! uhmm.. well it is a new day. i will hopefully attempt writing on paper, it is different than on the computer. with a clean piece of paper in front of me i create a map, rather than a continuous line like on the computer.  and map related, one of my favorite books which i haven't bought yet, is all about maps of the subconscious and conscious and life and emotions and thoughts. i wasn't able to find it at the contemporary museum of art store in Oberhausen, but there is hope yet.   urlLink Atlas der Erlebniswelten (maybe one translation of such a title would be The Atlas of World/Life Experiences)  a day filled with maybes, but i can still breathe :)

      a couple of extra useless books. i suppose they must offer answers to those who have no time to think on their own, but for me nothing.  1. i keep on putting off my great exploration into the idea of gender. it makes me uncomfortable to spend too much time thinking about it and of course i rarely wish to create greater discomfort.  2. behavior modification seems a necessary evil at this point. continuing as before would be stupidity and far worse than a 'necessary evil.'  and so i end another couple of thoughts, not sure quite how i should escape my current state of mind, not sure that whether what i need is to escape or just to look at life differently.

      new journeys in undiscovered territories. well currently attempting to look at some new texts which has turned out far more boring than previously expected, but it's alright. everything will be returned.  clarity is definitely not my forte. i'm not sure how sad i really am about that, but i guess with time i might get slightly clearer about what i'm trying to say and do.  for now i quit these thoughts, i'm sure i'll have something to develop further soon enough.

      like water and sand between my fingers. this summer i miss the black sea, i feel like that is where i should be, but am not and am sad and helpless in face of the distance. i can't help it, obviously but it still saddens me.  where are all the magical answers hiding? there are few rocks to search beneath, but maybe under sidewalks, and skyscrapers,  maybe behind the neon signs. i won't give up searching, somehow i know they are out there and that gives me an extra breath.

      i do not know where to begin my thoughts in here, and there are always so many of them.  1. intimidation/fear/gender. every time i think of gender i take a deep breath, i inhale and then exhale and then wonder why it is that i have such reactionary feelings about it, why i feel the need to first strike back and think only afterwards. what is it that i cannot accept? i cannot accept the roles that are pre-assigned that even the questioners don't question. there are so many ways of defining gender, one's gender, inherent physical/biological definitions, societal ones and then i suppose somewhere in the mix another section. and i identify, but i do not. i have never questioned whether i identified, i always knew i did, but i have always questioned with what and do i have a choice? do people look at me the same way i look at them? we'd be in trouble then. without accepting my gender (on a general level) i cannot accept myself, a constant battle, no ending in sight, a discomfort that can take one over at any moment, a rash action that is harder to take back.

      the reactions i have to groups, to ideological impositions, to myself.  partly it is a question of a group, of feeling constantly on the outside of a group so that groups have negative connotations and have had them for ages. i'm not even sure if it is within me to be inside a group, or if i would be happy if i was inside. i can no longer tell if this is because of me and who i am or if it is because what i have become through experience, i suppose a mixture of the two.  i am a reactionary person, no doubts. i have a lot of anger, a lot of aggression inside and i do not want to blame myself for it, but instead prefer to analyze to see its strengths and weaknesses and of course eliminate the flaws in my thinking and my way of being and reacting.

      the tight schedule... wednesday is missing once again. i suppose it is different when i have allotted myself the time away, but i dislike missing a day in my writing ritual. it is supposed to be an exercise, and exercises are meant to be structured, but somehow i react even to my own structure, i dislike all structure and at the same time yearn for it in a way or another, trying to impose it on myself, trying to find it outside of me so i can enter it ready-made.

      feel guilty about who i am and who i admire in life. i don't want to feel guilty for feeling anger, or for understanding anger and extremes.  sometimes i wonder if i should be ashamed, or what that will resolve. will that take me further in the direction i want to go? will that change me in a positive way? is it shameful not to fit even my own idea of perfection, because i do not fit it. i cannot fit when i read the words i read and feel understanding.  such a vail cover these words, right now i am not ready to lift it.  and with the words above i suppose i must forcefully end the vacation i had imposed on myself.
