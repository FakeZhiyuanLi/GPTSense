      I'm planning on opening a restaurant in the next 5-years. A friend tipped me off to some competition that might be headed my way....  World Entertainment News Network reported Monday:     Mary-Kate's Culinary Ambition     Troubled teen star  urlLink Mary-kate Olsen  wants to train as a chef and open her own restaurant - despite having just checked out of rehabilitation for an eating disorder The 18-year-old actress spent six weeks in an undisclosed health facility until leaving last month, but insists she loves food and dreams of cooking for a living in the future. The  urlLink New York Minute  multi-millionaire said in a recent interview - before her eating disorder was revealed - "I want to go to culinary school because I love cooking. One day I'd love to open up a restaurant or cafe." Both Mary-Kate and her sister Ashley will begin studying at New York University this autumn.

      Following a week-long break-up a little while ago, Boyfriend made a statement saying that he knew why I had been depressed about our relationship...."You see, they say semen is like Prozac right? Well I just don't think you've gotten the proper dosage lately. Turns out an ex-girlfriend of his did...  Boyfriend and I went to go rent a movie last night. As I was trying to decide between two flicks that both turned out to be horrible, he comes running around the corner of the aisle and crouches down... Turns out he was hiding from someone he didn't want to see. This would be understandable behavior if he was perhaps in 5th or 6th grade, however he is 24 forchristssake...It was an ex. Not just any ex, but the one whom he lost his virginity to 7 years ago (and is apparently still sentimental about the short time that they were together). I'm serious. Not only is it his ex-girlfriend, but he says that she is carrying something that seems to be a baby but he's not sure. It looks kind of like a prune. Since then my friends, I have witnessed meltdown. Boyfriend is babbling, incoherently about some girl that I don't give a shit about who now has a 3 week old kid at the age of 24. Oh yeah, it's not a bastard child either, ex-girlfriend is also married. I only know this because she sent Boyfriend a friendster message as soon as she got home asking why he didn't say hi and that all she's been up to in the past couple of years has been being a wife and now a mom and that it gets boring, so she just wanted to say hi....I honestly don't care about this situation at all other than the fact that it has turned my boyfriend into a marriage hating, baby cursing pussy. while i have no interest in either of those things for anytime in the near future, i do want to do what most normal people do, and share my wonderful genes. Should I waste my time? It's interesting that this comes after him stating, two nights ago, that he leans towards pro-life on the issue of a woman's right to choose. We had a fight then (which I won), but I'm sure this situation made something click and cleared him up, as he reminded me to take my birth control before going home.  I know h only means well, but seriously, get over it and get on with your life right?  I don't feel neglected, just a little pissed off that when ever he talks about the exes, they're nothing and now this is what is considered a "situation."  Fuck situations and fuck this shit and fuck your ex-girlfriend... oh wait, someone else did that already, and look where that got her.

       When I'm not working, I'm working. My only day off is Sunday, and it's such a drag knowing that just as my weekend is beginning, it's actually over. What does help is that my day job is pretty flexible and I can pretty much go home as soon as I'm done, however, I never seem to have a whole day to myself. Yesterday, my one day off, I slept later than I remember having slept in months. Noon. Woke up, went home from boyfriend's house and just putzed around till afternoon when I went to go meet a friend for beers. After beers? went back to boyfriend's house, rented a movie, ate, and fell asleep again before midnight. That's it day over. What excitement. Now it's 10:30 on Sunday morning and I'm ready to walk out the door to go to the restaurant for my weekly 12-hr. shift in Thai-Land just so I can come home hot, tired, and smelling like peanut sauce. But at least I'll be able to pay my bills this month (I hope).
