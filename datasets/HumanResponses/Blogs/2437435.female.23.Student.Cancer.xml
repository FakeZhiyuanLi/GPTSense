						   Gravid with Nascent Thoughts -   Given my horrible mood for the past few days, I am even more confused about everything. I am frustrated with a great many things like why is it so difficult to open myself up to people, especially those who are near and dear to me?  Perhaps there is something within me which is desperately trying to either escape or come forward. Robert asked me last night if I have these horrible feelings in a manic frenzy between fits of anger and frustration, and hysterical crying and self-loathing. So I began to think and analyze what happens. I haven't considered myself happy really ever. But these are things I have kept to myself and quite hidden, so even writing this is a painful and anguishing prospect. I was talking to Michelle about this on Friday, (though my mood had started Thursday-night-ish) and I haven't really been an open person to many people. I am not saying that I am a liar by any means, but about my past and feelings, its like pulling teeth as someone has told me.   Well, after thinking about things, I have realized why. Since my childhood and especially after my father's death, I have had 2 major characteristics. 1. I am a people pleaser and 2. My feelings are mine and mine alone - mentality which I should keep everything personal to myself. Both of these have a little good in them and are meant well, but are  a little destructive. I would rather put up with a lot of pain and surpress my feelings than chance someone even taking something that I say wrong. This is most evident in my family which is the hardest to deal with.   I cannot understand how come my friends still talk to me. After reflecting I realized that I can turn around any argument in my favor and I am sure I have used it more than a few time,s even subconsciously, which makes me feel more than horrible.   For all you who read it, think about it, I am sure I have done it sometime, and I am truly sorry. I don't understand when being right was more important than knowing what's right, but I think that's why I try to please people and why it may be so hard to say goodbye. It's easier for me to make someone mad at me and have them leave me then for me to leave them.   I just think about how different things could have been if I had realized these things sooner.  But then again, "Only a life lived for others is a life worth while. " - Albert Einstein

						   Pessimism is a cursed blessing I think.   I don't consider myself a pessimist. I think of a pessimist as someone who is waiting for it to rain. And I feel soaked to the skin. ~ Leonard Cohen   A California pessimist carries a card in his wallet that reads, "In case of an accident -- I'm not surprised.   A pessimist sees only the dark side of the clouds, and mopes; a philosopher sees both sides, and shrugs; an optimist doesn't see the clouds at all - he's walking on them.  ~Leonard Louis Levinson  The basis of optimism is sheer terror.  ~Oscar Wilde  an optimist is a guy that has never had much experience. ~Don Marquis, archy and mehitabel, 1927  Always borrow money from a pessimist, he doesn't expect to be paid back.  ~Author Unknown   I am sorry for all who read this, I am just in a icky kind of mood, and for those know me well, bare with me. These come and go, but they seem to come more than they go. hehehe  that's pessimistic! But yea, I am having some serious issues and stuff and I don't know what's my problem... ok, I am just going to stay away from everyone for a little while.

						   Let's see, what is there to talk about? I enjoyed making an executive decision, too bad Rob didn't dig it too much.. especially when I called him a despot.. but oh well. He said he thought me being indecisive was cute... I don't know about that, everyone else thinks its annoying.  We had discussed religion and he doesn't buy into religion. Well, I remember at one point being an atheist.. but upon reflection I had discovered I was an atheist out of spite. Things happened that I didn't like, and bad things are perpetually happening to good people so why believe? Well, as logical as it may have been to me at the time; that theory did not hold up. Francis Bacon once said something like, "A novice in philosophy rejects God, but an expert returns to Him." I am not by any measure saying I am an expert. All I am saying is that, its harder to prove his existence than to be another great american skeptic. But I have been fiddling with a few possibilities. One, that man is innately good and does bad things (these bad things don't make him bad. There is a separation betwix act and man.) Or bad things happen to everyone equally just in different times, stages and ways, so no one is above this dealing. Thirdly, as Mia Farrow says, "Life is about losing, and doing it as gracefully as possible." Just as I said, no man can escape time, no one can escape a bit of bad luck and misfortune, and I would not want to. Granted I am super pessimistic anyway, but these things which seem to paralyze us for multiple moments and what makes us us. I do not think my life was at all as bad as some of my associates, though through different eyes I would see why other's would think it. And no matter how much pain is there, why wish something that made me whom I am today disappear, or block it out of memory?  I am resolute that things are not as bad as I make them out to seem, though I hate it when I am having my "Pity Party, Table for One" moment, and someone interjects to tell me that. I want to experience all aspects of life. The good with the bad. Besides, there is can't be a rainbow without the storm, the light without the darkness, the joy without pain and the life without death. There are enough     Momentomori in life, without Rob reminding me of them.

						   Well, I had a wonderful time yesterday with a certain someone. I didn't think hanging out at parks and cursing malls could be so enjoyable.. It sure had been awhile. We hung out from 10am-about midnight and I still found it extremely difficult to leave... crazy kid, how'd he do it? I haven't the foggiest! But the views were breath-taking, the conversation delightful and the other stuff.... exclusive Hehehehe... Let's just put it this way, it's all down in history for sure! I do recommend seeing the view from the Oddessey resturant where ever it is. Hopefully, this is just a beginning of more fun times to come. I just have to try not to be a smart-ass all the time, curse, correct constantly (though he swears its cute), and I think I will let him win an arguement or two now and again. *wink wink*   ~*~*~*~Brief pause at recollection of yesterday*~*~*~  What in Sam Hell was I talking about now?? Ok, I guess we should get some philosophical mombo-jumbo out of the way, since that is why I have this crazy contraption! I told Rob last night that no one lives for the moment, and everything you do is in preparation for a tomorrow which is uncertain of us ever seeing it. No matter how you think you are living, its apparent that it cannot be for the moment. The simple task of eating is to sustain you for a future moment and life. Work is to get paid in the future. So if one was to merely live for today, he wouldn't eat or work or even use the restroom because they are a waste of time and prevent you from enjoying the "now". I stuck up this conversation with my fav. prof and he said "Is God living for the moment?" and I replied, "God is not subject to time and cannot live, since he created time and life. He is eternal and cannot have personifications."  I stumped him and presented my hierarchy: Goodness (God has to be all good for most people) God Time Earth Man Each is subject to what is before it and dominated by what is after it. That's all for now. My dog is in a crate crying and its sooooo sad, My Poopie baby!!!!!!!

						   "One may have a blazing hearth in one's soul, and yet no one ever comes to sit by it. Passers by only see a wisp of smoke rising from the chimney and continue on their way." --Vincent van Gogh  There aren't many things I regret in life, most of the one's I do, were just plain old carelessness. I usually hold other's feelings at a high point and try my damned-ist not to make anyone hurt intentionally. But things happen in this lawless universe. But perhaps things happen for a reason; that would be the way of the Optimist to view things, but some of us less loyal Susie Sunshines approve more directly the Gloomy Gus school of thought that "It could have happened and what if" scenarios. I tend not to ask too much of what could have been, but at times I feel the pull of curiosity, "what if I took the long way home that night?" But what purpose does it really serve? It won't change anything. Just like an armchair enthusiast criticizing the plays when he refuses to partake. who am I to be selfish enough to end one thing and get upset when the other is more content. For example, I may quit my job and speak to someone who still works there, and find out business is going well. I can't curse them for enjoying their job when I voluntarily left! But this is the problem of being human. We are fascinating creatures but our fancies change a little too quickly from time to time. We have no one/thing to blame but ourselves, unfortunately. Especially speaking existentially; what ever fortune or misfortune is brought on by your own hands. No one is given a great hand, you merely must make the best of it and hope for the best and prepare for the worst. But, for what its worth, Love comes quickly, but it seldom leaves abruptly.   Ok, now lame commentary. The more I write on here the more I realize my life is quite uneventful. No offense Rob... but I don't have floods of goings on.. except Rob and the "teaching me of facts not on the IQ test"... which makes me shutter, and my stupid accounting class that makes me respect my CPA a lot more now. Let's see if I can not make Rob upset with my retardedness.... he is super silly. Well, anyone to put up with my bizarreness should get an island... Here I declared it!!! Send me your requests and I will see what me and my eccentric brain can do!!! Arrivederci!!

						   Everyone knows how anti-flakey people I am. I hate it when you make plans and someone keeps missing them. Okay, I know I suck at returning calls and stuff, but this is different. I know it sucks I had to cancel like 2 dates with Rob, but one I did go to LA to spend his lunch hour with him.. that was nice. I really really REALLY like him, but he doesn't think so and I don't know how to tell him and make this up to him.. I mean, for Pete's Sake, I stopped swearing like a sailor for him, 95% of the time... (Sorry Paul and Tom).. 5% are accidents and usually moreso in my head! So I shake a fist!  And today wasn't really my fault either. I am taking a horrible class Accounting 101, don't ask why its a long horrible story. The abridged Reader's Digest version is I need a C or better to go to UCR and I am sucking ass in this class. Who knew the anti-capitalist would have no sense for business huh?? But I digress. I got a tutor, one of my so called friends who just got his Masters in the damn field. And so, I have a huge test on Saturday (its online so there is no teaching) and I made 4 appointments with my tutor and yea, yesterday morning he tells me he can meet me that day at 1pm... I was more than peeved and vexed. So, I had thought I would be able to study with Scott (tutor) and be cool to see Rob a couple times... Until the fool hasn't shown, and this is the second test I am not prepared for. Then of course my older brother is visiting, and you know there is no end to "brotherly council." Okay, I am done, hopefully Rob will read this and get more of a gist for where I'm coming from... When someone is upset with me, I kind of clam up so he doesn't know this stuff...   On a brighter note, I decided that going to a public library to study is a bad idea. I kept people watching and they become characters in my story and yea... too much time was lapsing and I grabbed a book on Van Gogh and so, yea, school library in a cubicle (I don't stare at people our age as much as children and older folks.... not in a pervy way either.) If anyone wants to see what is going on with my random short story synthesis, let me know... Cheers mates!

						   After all the guy hating thing, I found a fella who is a nice guy!!!!! Ok, he is the nicest guy! We hung out in LA and it was the best-est time. See, fun enough to use made up words for.. At any rate, I don't even know how to describe him because he is so special. He is totally selfless and caring, but not in a sissy wierdo kind of way. We aren't completely opposites, but we aren't the same, but I don't know. The only thing that is great is the usual stuff that bothers me and makes me worry doesn't. And its hilarious how he is so concerned with Michelle (best friend for those who haven't met her yet) finding flaws in him so things aren't like "too good to be true". I don't know, I like the way I feel when I talk to him and .... I'm gonna stop all this talk because I think I'm rambling a little too much here. (Sorry Rob  *wink wink*)  Besides that... more randomness. I haven't been able to get passed an idea that is so simple: Time has never stopped for anyone. Even Jesus was a slave to it. There has never been anyone who didn't have to turn old, who lived forever, remained a child for eternity, etc. It's a fascnating notion really that everything must give way. Water can dissolve absolutely anything through time. Time is so great there is no way of expressing its greatness. How long is infinity and forever? This does help one's everyday struggles as well. Though we may be completely finite, there is comfort in knowing "this too shall pass." Everything must come to an end and a new beginning is waiting to get started. Pain can not last forever, niether can sorrow. Though life is full of these emotions, take solace that everyone is on this adventure and carries the same fears and loathings as torches through the endless tunnel of life. They are not permenant and do come and go like other emotions. Some go on to the end where the light has teased and begged them. Others are weary and have stopped on the sides to catch their breath. And still there are those who have stopped all together going or even starting and trying.

						   It has been about a month of Sundays since I have written on here, and that would be for a few reasons. Firstly that I have had a lot of things to keep my mind occupied. Secondly, people to keep my time occupied. And thirdly, and most importantly, I always forget how to get it to let me write stuff on here. That being said, its good to note that I have continued in my pursuit of writing bad literature and as my older brother and Michelle eloquently stated, they are starting my fan club.  As my head finally starts to shrink, I will go on about the things in my life which are of note.  The APA (American Philosophical Association) conference was amazing to say the least. I dragged Michelle to this enchanting event and as always, she made it a laugh fest.. Hey Michelle, I am going to document the Huntington Library experience and Chantry Flats (ironic title) so future generations can laugh at us too! The highlight of it was the next day Friday, where I took off school and met up with my favourite professor and to say I was enthralled is not a strong enough word. Granted most people there looked like they were out of a time and social warp, but it comes with the nerdy territory I crave and I'm sure my friends and family won't let me become like that. I spoke to some professors at Stanford, and now... that is going to be my aim for graduate and law school.  It is wonderful when you love something more than yourself and to get a concentrated channel of it and see a window into your soul as clear as air. It's true that if it wasn't for philosophy, the pursuit of knowledge, wisdom and ethics, I wouldn't be who I am, but don't think I am after this for a piece of paper to hang on my study wall. Its what all this can help me do for humanity. I want to make up for all the times I looked away when I should have lent a hand. For everytime I had more to give and didn't. For the lives I could have touched but didn't. Its a very selfish dream but its a means to an incredible end.   If I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain, If I can ease one life the aching, Or cool one pain,  Or help one fainting robin Unto his nest again, I shall not live in vain ~Emily Dickinson

						   Well as usual, when it rains it pours. I mistakenly told my mom that I would probably be working full time when I get to UCR and she flipped out. She thought almost everything was taken care of and I told her it would have been, but I opted not to use the parent loan of about $8,000. She reminded me of all the lovely things she hates about me comparing me to my brothers and various other people she usually loathes, but now wishs she had them instead. Then of course, she had to remind me of what a disappointment I am and how she has been calculating how much she has spent on me during the past years, and all the times I helped oput (which was every paycheck since I began working) would never amount to the debt and how she wishes she hadn't because I am not worth it again. She has told me that she refuses any help, money, even her name or signature. She also said, no matter what happens to me when I get out of this house she won't give a flying *bleep* because it doesn't matter to her anymore. That was my fun filled morning. Hmm... why do I keep getting depressed?????

						   Well, my moodiness and absurdity has not scared Robert away. Most would have ran for the hills screaming into the arms of some therapist or counselor by now. And for all the garbage I have put him threw I am sorry, profoundly sorry. I do find it easier to write than speak. I don't know why, but thoughts just flow better in more concise and clear manners when put in text instead of arbitrarily spat like tobacco, usually misread and harmful involuntarily. At any rate, there will be no way of truly telling him how I feel for him. My feelings are as strong as they can possibly be. I have never been able to fully trust someone the way I can with him. He makes me feel at ease as he talks about "us" in the long term..which is stranger than fiction the way things are these days. It's one thing to know that sex isn't going to happen until we engage in a binding social contract and enter an institution, but to make me feel like it's the right thing to do, makes him special. When he lets me tell him all the insignificant goings-on of my day and takes the most genuine of interests makes him special. The way that every story I tell that makes me open up old wounds, he understands my tears makes him special. Putting up with me not seeing these things, makes him special. There are countless other reasons why I am lucky to have him in my life, but these are the ones that have been floating in the sky which is my head like hot air balloons traveling around the world. And for what it's worth.. I think that with Robert I can put my guard down and let him in... which is so difficult.

						   Perhaps its the achy body from improper sleep talking, but I started thinking about the artists. Those back in the age of the Renaissance, particualrly. Those men and imexpressable talent and their works have withstood the test of time. Shakespeare, Milton, Homer, Lord Byron, Emily Dickenson, etc. So it begs the question to be asked. Undoubtedly, there are some people who's talent is no great that it is a tower and an immeasurable ruler to compare others by. But is there an artistic part in everyone? Somepeople (me for sure)would kill to be able to paint or draw. We love the work so much that to be able to contribute to society in that way would fill us with the most happiness... But alas, I can draw only cartoons, and I doubt the Louve will ever want a characature of my 10th grade Chemistry professor on its walls, next to greats. So I an a faithful patron at museums and try to live vicariously throuhg the works of those who suffered and gave their lives for their art. So that it wasn't in vain!  I was having a pretty yucky day a few days/weeks ago and I saw Rob, and he got me some Godiva chocolates... but of course it was 94 degrees so it melted... but the gesture was sweeter than the candy. We have been having some tough times... fighting a lot.. but we have been working through it and I think things will be ok. I know my moods can be a little annoying at times, but I think the way I make people feel when I am in a better mood more than makes up for it.. I hate to toot my own horn but BEEP BEEP! Thnaks hunny! I miss you... though I don't say it often enough for ya!

						   I was studying for my upcoming finals and as I gazed out my window I started thinking. Isn't it strange that in your life there are millions of other lives intertwined. It reminds me of the Jainas in India. They practice extreme measures of faith and live extremely aesthetically. They eat once a week and spend most of their days meditating. When they walk, they even sweep with a small broom the organisms in front of them as to not step on them. They believe this because on a person's body there are millions upon millions of cells and Jainas believe that each cell has it's own soul and is on the path to liberation (the highest form is humans). So the act of bathing, scratching, moving, etc is killing of souls and is violence. They are truly the only non-violent religion. At any rate, I have a wonderful view of this hillside with raspberries, trees, grass and flowers. As I looked into the menagerie of vegetation, I thought how only a thin piece of glass and a screen held me back from a world (for the most part) untouched by man's hands.   I have probably mentioned my analogy for life already, but I think it's worth noting. Life is like the hottest summer day. The only relief in sight is a semi-long walk to the seaside or pool... There are 2 kinds of people. Those people who will walk regardless of anything because they know what they want and will accomplish their goals. Then there are people who will sit inside or under a tree and wonder what could have been or criticize the others.

						   Why must try so hard to be hated? They may even be misunderstood. Perhaps they are trying to "teach" the ever invaluable lesson, but will always come across as sheer malice and once this is felt, there is no going back. Either you have such contempt for me that you can not control yourself in a civil manner, or I am so stupid that by forcing me in a corner you think I can only be taught. Those are how I view things and I make no apologizes for it. It may change later in my life, like looking back you see why parents told you not to do something, and you may even thank them for it. But what about right now? Is it okay to make someone feel isolated and alone, even ashamed and stupid just for a lesson that only tomorrow may or may not bring? I am absolutely positive there are other ways of handling these situations, but who am I. All I can comment on is my feels as these things and other painful experiences shape and torment my psyche and soul.  There is no refuge from the devastating storm, Nor does there seem to be any relief in sight. Only the bombardment of pain on the soul of the lovelorn. One can see to the horizon, but who wants to look that far? The aching and suffering shall never seize in this heart. No oasis or sanctuary awaits this lonely weary traveler. No smoke from a friendly hearth to sit by. No food or drink to sustain life. All there is is the pitter-patter of the broken heart. To withdraw within seems a pleasant fate Until one learns of everything is hate. And every door is perpetually slammed in his face. These feelings and experiences can never be replaced. And if by chance one starts to smile, As good as gold, it will be defiled. For one lesson is as sure as sure can get. Your best bet is never to let yourself forget.  Bad to worse And low to lower, I sink farther and farther to thinner. To continue to live is to love to suffer. And if you think a great day shall come, Pray, tell me when your mansion was a slum? To such idiotic idealism I have become numb. When will the tears stop streaming? When will the end not fuel the beginning? Running away feels just so right. To day dream is the only way to lie awake for night. Both these ways I feel my wings take flight. Others take relish in your grievances of the present and future, Only in my dreams my life has true luster. So, I pray each night not to awaken me to quickly. And I have no ties to the world completely.

						   Well, not much is going on here. I kept getting these pop ups and jazz about poetry contests. So I submitted one.. More so because it gets copywrited. It is a big deviation from the things I usually write about, but eh, you guys can read it. Its why I started writing the story I am working on too... FYI.  For the Miners  I am writing this for those who cannot. I am hoping those who read it can and will help.  Tonight, I cried for the people who are alone.  The people who do not know what it's like to live.  They seem not this way, but are forlorn. They give all the have to give.  But are taken for all they have. I feel pain for those who have so little and seem so content,  but deserve so much more.  I hurt knowing what could have been for them,  and what waits ahead.   They work tirelessly and give up the essentials of life, because they are told, this is how it must be. They have strong features and worn skin. Torn clothes and stories to tell. Their fingers were worked to the bone long ago. And have no where to go but down. The mines are the work,  The streets their home. They do all they need to do,  but the purpose is none.   We watch these scenes, as horrific as it seems, and just pray to god, "Thank God, that's not me!" They die younger and younger,  and no one knows why. But what they live and die for,  is always unexplored.  Why must these acts go on being committed? In a world where things seem not be left to chance, Why are people being slaughtered like lambs? If financial gain is all that is at stake,  What will they do when there is no more to excavate?  The youth do not know what it is like,  how beautiful it is to be alive. But soon they too will join there ancestors in the skies. Looking back on all they could have done, but it is far too late for the setting sun.  Even the bare essentials are too much to get. How are they to begat the rest? Why are we still sitting here watching? The day is now, the time is still a blessing. There is no much to do, so few to do them.

						   The pain that has encompassed me entire being is one in which cannot easily be explained. It was the final blow to end all blows which made the sunset on happiness. I find myself more alone than I may have exaggerated in my prior writings to add emphasis. This feeling makes me feel like I cannot breathe, but I have to sigh. It makes me unable to swallow for fear of nausea. It is this dull pain through my chest and stomach, but recurrences play like an old movie which I know all the lines to in my mind. Each like the dagger being twisted deeper and deeper. Feeling paralyzed and helpless gave way to hopelessness upon reflection. How could something one thought to be so beautiful and pure turn so ugly and gray? I must go on and search for the radiance I used to possess and searched for. If nothing else this has been a lesson well learned, though these lessons are better not taught. All one needs at this point is tranquility to remove the sorrow. My mind has a hard time settling and now it cannot move on.

						   The walls are closing in and I see no immediate escape.  I might as well be trapped out at sea, Too far out that the lighthouse misses me. My mind and soul cannot set easy on anything.  This meloncholiness is taking form into madness. I d not know which way is up and I cannot see clearly.  Things I had counted on before have vanished leaving me to take solace in isolation and grieving.  How did things get so bad? The sun is shining but in the ever midnightness of my charred heart I see no beauty. Before the Full Moon's rays gave everything such a beautiful glow, but now it makes things too foggy too see. All I can think about is leaving it all for dead and going away. Sure I may miss some people, but I can look back fondly.  This world has yet to offer anything substantial enough to create stakes high enough to gamble myself, sanity and love.  Perhaps in another time things wouldn't have to be like this, but as of right now... If there is a God he better have a hell of a plan. All there is is misery, despair and anguish and for what? What is the incentive? You work all your life at a job you hate for retirement? By then you are too old to do anything you had to give up for work. "It's better to have loved and lost, then to have never loved at all.." But if it caused you so much pain, how could you be sure it was indeed love?  And if love is so beautiful and pure, why is hatred right across the line?

						   Things just have a habit of going from bad to worse. As a friend once told me, when you think you have hit rock bottom, the floor gives out on you. But oh well, I'd say I have my health, but I'm not feeling well. I'd say I have my friends, but I am just not going there... I have most of my friends and I thank God for them. And I will leave family and school out of this. At any rate, here is an exerp from a story I'm working on.  Please tell me the good and bad parts.   She was in a frenzy to get away from everyone she could. It pained her to be around anyone, even to be seen. She always felt alone, and that was this was the climax of her moments. But now, she craved to stay alone but couldn't. She tried to stop crying, the tears wouldn't. She tried to calm down, her heart told her it shouldn't. He kept following her and she tried to get him to stop. Finally, she gave in. She warned him about her moods and that he didn't want to be around. He replied he wanted to be there for her and she said she didn't. Then in a flash, it seemed like he knew she would hurt him more than ever, and he told her he would see her later. This broke her broken heart further. She thought he didn't care even when he said he did, and now it seemed absolute that he didn't. She had no right to be further upset, but she desperately wanted to believe him and only him. She wanted him to make everything all right, to take her in his arms and calm her. Now, she was devastated. As he turned and walked away, she stared in disbelief. Just as he turned back, she left. Resolute not to give in to anyone; to stay with her emotions alone. She was the only one here now. She is all she knows; she is the shroud of mystery, to herself especially.     "   She walked a ways, and it seemed that she couldn't remember where she was , or where she was going. She finally sat down on the street corner. Her eyes moved up the street to an unusual figure. A woman across the lane holding her child. The brown hair interlocked in the rough hard hands of the mother. The face was scrunched against her chest with his eyes closed as if he were in a deep sleep. But this looked strange, the mother was not singing a lullaby. She was screaming frantically and at the top of her lungs and shaking. Her voice and body shook violently as her tear stained face showed the rawest of pain. The sights and sounds sent chills up and down the spines of everyone within an earshot range.   Who would dare to go near this grieving mother? There was a helpless hopelessness in the abundant in the air this evening, and it seemed to foretell of the season to follow.       "

						   Well,I would apologize for not being on here in a long while, but I am sure I write this for me and me alone. Besides wanting to seperate from my family like Church from State, I have just been miserable and moody and there is a full moon again.  I want to thank everyone for bearing with me, especially Tom and Paul... of course Michelle and Rob were kinda patient .. j/k.. but these 2 gentleman would not leave my side and made me laugh and stuff mostly when I wanted to wallow etc. Next time I see you, you get the biggest hug ever... and a present! I also have a new found OBSESSION with The Smiths!! Oh man oh man, I just wish I wouldn't have waited so long.. MMMMMMMMmmmmmmm Smiths.... Morrissey...  what am I doing here????   Well, my depressive moods have caused me much an unsettled mind and luckily I did write some of my feelings down.  "I don't need, nor will I ever need anyone in my life. The basis for this is abundantly clear that no one thinks about me in the proper form. Most everyone (avoid generality with respect to logic, not excluding anyone) has an agenda and uses me and anyone else in accordance with it. I regret to inform myself that genuine emotion from anyone not tied into how I can facilitate something for them, is absurd.  I have held in my emotions to points where they have been breakdowns and even I myself could not make heads or tails of things. I feel like I am in an abyss over taken by some force that will never clear my soul. No one would ever understand this pain because to them remote minute things seem to set me off, but that is not the story. These small farthings are pebbles falling after and before an avalanche and remind me of past and future pain, creating  present.  Its more than just general sadness, its far more. Its the realization that feelings do not matter to anyone. I take others feelings and preserve them while others see this as a   weakness."  And please no one take this as I am attacking any one person, because it was the rawest of emotions and an outpour. Next time I will relay the stories I am and have been working on fervently.

						   Big lapse I know, but I don't think there is much to mention or if anyone even really reads this. I have just been going through some tough times and hoping relief from this storm is eminent and soon. I have never wanted to leave my life as much as I have during the past few weeks. My writing, attitude, relationships and friendships have all taken a severe beating. But as Morrissey says, "I will not say I'm sorry." I have been a people pleaser for so long that I forgot what I need to make myself happy. I have been stuck in the mind set that nothing will ever make me happy so I might as well make everyone else's day brighter. I don't care if I am misunderstood. I don't care if people are getting hurt, intentionally or not; it never seems to come out right away. All I know is that I feel alone and I am unhappy. One of Robert's friends Rashar (who happens to be the most lovely person inside and out) was telling me to not forget about myself while I am trying to fix everything. And it clicked. Why should I not take a compliment? Why not take some time for myself? Why not think about me? Well, at least for the last one is because I was always afraid I would be labeled as selfish, and I was still labeled that even when I wasn't being so. I just don;t know. I am working towards and saving for an uncertain future, and who knows, these may be the best years of my life. I have been trying to open up to people, and not because I have wanted to. But because I felt like that would make them happy. I am tired of putting everyone before myself... But even as I write this I am ashamed of these remarks. I am writing even though in my mind I am yelling at myself that Rob or Michelle are going to read this and be upset. I have to force myself not to delete these thoughts because I can't talk to anyone about my loneliness, and I fear that I can't write about it either. I don't want people to know about the vulnerable part of me because of stupid insecure reasons.  1. I think they will hold it against me or view me in a different light. 2. They will feel sorry for me. 3. They will remind me that people have it way worse and I should get over it. (This because then I would feel like my emotions are unsubstantiated.) 4. I don't want to be vulnerable. This is probably why I haven't been intimate with anyone also(not just physically, but in friendship alike). I am afraid of giving anyone that part of me because I have felt abandoned too many times to just roll with the punches.  More than anything I just feel stupid.. who knows, by writing this I may just hurt and lose the only people who have cared about me outside of family. But what can I do? I can't scream from mountain tops as much as I heart begs me to. I can't run away like my mind advises me. I can't forget as my soul is adamantly against it... I just need to be held.... I need to be told things will get better... That forever isn't just in fairy tales... That I am worth something of great value because most of the time I second guess myself wonder why anyone pays me any attention. "She says she loves me... then she must be insane." --Morrissey... I don;t have much and I am so sure its all going to be taken away at my own hand... Hopefully everyone won't hate me.  "Don't walk in front of me; I may not follow. Don't walk behind me; I may not lead. Just walk beside me and be my friend." -- Albert Camus
