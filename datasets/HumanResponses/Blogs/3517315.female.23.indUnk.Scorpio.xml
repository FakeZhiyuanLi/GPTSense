      Okay... If i wrote about my situations w/my ex, i would have a huge fucking post, so I've decided not to write about boys at all. It's been FUCKIN' MADNESS!!!!   So.... um.....  uh.... let's see... It's FRIDAY!  Yay!!!!  This weekend is the Apalachin Fireman's Field Days.  Tonight i'll be taking my daughter to watch the fireworks.  Tomorrow i'll be taking her to my aunt's to watch the parade go up the street and go to the Field Days to ride rides and stuff.  That's exciting.   Yesterday i went to one of those Adult Bookstores all by myself!  How creepy.  It was like me and 10 hairy greasy icky men.  I bought a lovely blue "personal massager" w/a dolphin on it to give my clitoris the special attention that it deserves.  I took it up to the guy to pay for it and he was like "I have to test it", so of course, i giggled b/c i thought he was joking.  It turns out he was serious... i guess they have a "no refund, no return" policy (which makes sense), so he had to take it out of the box and put batteries in it and make sure it worked AND IT DIDN'T!!!  So i had to go get another one!!!  It was very awkward, but the guy was really cool about it.    Other than that, i guess i have no news. Ta ta.

      1st blog ever. I'm sure that by tomorrow I'll forget I even started this whole blog thing... Maybe not tho'.  We'll see.    Oh... what to talk about???  Umm... I dumped my boyfriend this weekend.  Now I have to move all my shit, including a piano, couch, entertainment center, etc., out of his house.  That sucks.  He's a cool guy, but unfortunately, cannot be honest.  He has a serious lying problem.  I have given him  plenty  of chances and this weekend was the last straw.  Hopefully this will be a wake up call and he won't fuck up future relationships the same way.  Good luck to him.   Now I am at work.  I am a Customer Relations rep for a utility company.  Everyone that calls hates me.  Makes for a long day.   I had a horrible dream last night that the world was ending due to global warming and I had no choice but to die a slow and painful death.  Thank you "Day After Tomorrow" previews!  It was a great way to start a great day. :)    The upside is that today is TUESDAY!!!  Only 3 and a 1/2 more shitty days left 'til the weekend. YAY!!!!!  Ta ta.
