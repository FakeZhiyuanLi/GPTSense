      Well, I'm back from Moab.  Unfortunatly, I'm back from Moab.  So, now I'm grumpy and I freaking hate all this "not-being-able-to-go-swimming/rock climbing/self-in-sand-burying-whenever-the-freak-I-want-to".  I'll probably snap out of it after a bit more playing around with the computer; I love my computer.  So,  expect more crazy websites and biting political dialogue, not to mention my blog as well.

      So, I saw this on Reuters recently...      A major investment bank is advising clients to have sex, get more sleep and stop equating happiness with money -- turning the industry image of hard-nosed dealmakers on its head.      German-owned Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein offers the advice in a note to clients by its strategist James Montier.       "I thought it was time that I reminded people there was more to life than watching screens every day," he told Reuters.       The note recommends clients have sex, ideally with someone they love, reflect on the good things in life, give their bodies enough sleep and exercise regularly.       But they shouldn't get too carried away.       "I still need a little bit of money just to keep me happy," said Montier.

      I struggled to think of which site it would be, but in the end, only one thing could be quite as entertaining as  urlLink this .  And that would be itself.  This one is a site that will be entertaining for all you East-highers out there.  Does this girl look slightly familiar to you?  Only...I don't think she's from South Carolina!  Thanks to the observant person who pointed this out!

      Well, the al-Qaeda terrorists in Saudi Arabia did what they said they would: killed Paul Johnson Jr, an American Lockheed Martin employee in Saudiland.  His beheaded body was left in the streets of Riyadh, and the kill was confirmed on a jihadist website.  I guess the silver lining to the cloud is that a top al-Qaeda leader in Saudi Arabia, Abdel Aziz al-Muqri, was killed when he deposited the body.  You can check CNN for information; if I make a link it'll be dead by tomorrow anyway. This makes me sick.  Where do these people get off in killing innocent people?  These people think they can twist their religion into an excuse for killing people just for the heck of it, and it makes me sick.  It makes me sick that they would do something like this to such an innocent person.   Where is a leader in Islam who preaches peace?  Do all the charismatic ones go into terror?  Do all of the mullahs and other preachers preach only war?  Youl'd think that the liberal media would report these people to try to fix the anti-arabic bias, but this just plays into the plan to make everyone think that Americans should keep their noses, as well as their people, out of every trouble spot in the world.  Jeez.  Correction: The Saudis are now saying that they have NOT, in fact, found Johnson's body, despite earlier reports to the contrary.

      Ok,  urlLink this  is, far and away, the best blog on the internet.  It's hillarious, it gets updated all day long, it talks about exploding cows and death squirrels and all that great stuff, so check it out! Try as I might, I cannot get the stupid thing to think that the above address is a link.  But I'll try again. Hah! Victory over the computer! I can do links!

      What if there was a "none of the above" option on the Presidential ballot?  Both Kerry and Bush are less than the ideal for the job, so what if you could vote against them both?  If there was a certain amount of votes for none of the above, both parties would have to trash their candidates and get new ones, with a minimal amount of time for advertising and campaigning.

      The former POTUS, Ronald Reagan was 93 when he died today of complications due to Alzheimer's Disease.   Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York released a statement.  "Whether you agreed or disagreed with Ronald Reagan, you can't deny he was honest, fought hard for what he believed in, and had the courage of his convictions. He will be remembered as one of our finer presidents," Schumer said.  Personaly, I think Reagan was right on many things.  People who disagree with me may say he could have brought about WWIII, but he didn't, what he DID bring about was the end to the Cold War.  The Soviets could not compete in the arm's race, and they ended up destroying themselves.

      Holy cow! George Tenet, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, just resigned!  This is a BIG DEAL!  This means Tenet and the CIA are taking ALL of the blame for intelligence faliures over Iraq and the WMD scandal!  CIA is being dealt a HUGE blow here!  The 9/11 commish found CIA and FBI guilty for not being very efficent, which the media jumped all over.  The media and the 9/11 commish acted totally irresponsible, and now America's Intelligence community is going to suffer for it.  Anticipate less money in the budget for CIA next year, maybe some Congressional Oversight...jeez.

      I admit it.  The name of my blog was only meant to be a temporary thing, but I'm not very creative.  Give me your ideas for a blog name! Please?
