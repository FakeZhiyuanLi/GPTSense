      Choices have two sides. the side we hate and the side that makes life worth something.    The side that we hate usually contains the choices the concern our future.  these ones sit here and we have total control over them, but at the same time they have total control over us.  We tell them where to go but they do the action.  They do exactly what we tell them to do and that is a lot of power.  As power hungry as humans are we dont really want it.  We dont like having to control our futures, but we still enjoy it with the little choices.  We only ever want power to show that we have victory.  These choices make or break us and that FEAR eats at us until we do that.  Once we overcome the fear we are on our way to true greatness.   We do enjoy some choices.  When we've had nothing to do for a while a choice can give life new meaning.  When we have too many choices, we get stressed.  Then our light, for fun choice becomes an omonious omen.    We must make choices, they will never leave us.  As humans we have many emotions and that can complicate things.  Imagine if we were happy all the time.  it would get rid of choices, but would hurt us.  we'd be happy to kill, happy to eat poison and die.  We need choices to be safe and life our life rather than another page out of a book.  In the end we need to remember that to keep life interesting we need to have choices no matter how hard they may be later.  We cant have perfection.  There are going to be some flaws, and we've got the best flawed life you could want

            Wow.  here we are. May 31st, 2004.  School is almost over.  we are so close to the end of middles school and life is seeming more and more pointless the further we get.  we wander around and try to "acomplish" something.  all it does is just go back and hurt you.  we need to find a point.  or not need a point.  thats what running does for me. or even soccer.  any sport for that matter.  i just want to get away.  gone for a while.  not forever, i couldnt stand that.  i guess i cant have that so i might as well stop dreaming and accept what i have.  wouldnt that be a waste of a life. sitting around waiting for a break from it.  i feel like a skitzo haveing a huge fight with myself.  life is pointless but yet, we have to enjoy it. the only think keeping us from doing that is ourselves.   we chose are life.  yeah there might be some outside factors, but still...we can control where we go and how far.  you can listen to the other crapolio people tell you, but in reality all that does is slow you down.  if you can outgrow that you are on the way to a WONDERFUL life.   just enjoy what you get.  yeah it might not be what you want, but you still have what you need....think about that one.        we sit here trying to think of something deep to say, but really you are the one who makes this as deep as you want it.  you can take what you want and leave what you dont. its all up to you in the end. so now that i'm done telling you what to do with ur life, i'm going to live mine by playing FIFA 98 party

      You ever felt like a skitzo?  You try to make up your mind but you can't. When your mind just runs around in circles trying to figure out the pros and cons.  In the end you just feel worse than you did?  Thats how i feel right now.  somethings seem right, but i'm not sure. its like the world has spit me out onto another planet. Now the reality check comes.  You get slapped and then you realize how stupid you are.  It hurts. A lot. I feel like the title...... Have you ever felt like you cant get away?  people are always looking over you shoulder and wont leave you alone.  Thats the way i feel right now.  I cant use my computer, my cousin sits and looks at it.  My sister too, just sitting there minding my own business. My mom and dad are never home.  i just need a break....HERE COMES SUMMER.   good night

      Well as you might guess, summer has been very busy for me.  You can tell as it has been a month since i have added anything to this miraculus webpage.  Well my parents make me work for them while they worry about me being to active.  Really to me its all just another step towards the end.  All of it is busy work, some pain, and a way to keep my mind off of things.  Life has lost a lot of point.  I have a few theories but each seem to only work up to a certain point. Another random thought is why do we have names?  I mean its a cool way to show personalities and all, but really its just a way to lable people.  if we were all just numbered wouldnt it be easier.  there would only be one 1239485.  Rather than 3 alex's and 5 davids.  so its just all so stupid.  like cold. there is no such thing scientificly speaking.  cold is what we call the lack of heat.  we just give names to describe things.   names.  something that seems so simple but aren't. Now its time to take a deeper look in life.  Everything we do is another step down a path.  We have to treat life like a race.  that gives it some point.  But between all of out problems, good times and bad times, there is just the right amout of everything.   We just dont like the amout of evil there is.  We cant do much about it though. All we can do is try to minimise it in our lives.  You cant ask for much more. Finally i'll talk about love.  Talk about an amazing thing.  An unseen power that can get us to jump off cliffs, or out windows for that matter.  We think we need it because thats what instinct tells us.  But who knows what love is anymore?  extream affection for a person?  how could that be, that could be a best friend.  i'm lost as to what it means. even the dictionary is confusing.  there are 10000 different meanings.  Heres what i think, love is what you want it to be.  i'll leave you with Mr. Webster and his opinion:   1 a (1) : strong affection for another arising out of kinship or personal ties   (2) : attraction based on sexual desire : affection and tenderness felt by lovers (3) : affection based on admiration, benevolence, or common interests   b : an assurance of love

      This morning at the end of soccer camp the coach gave us a speech.  He started talking about how our own soccer team with our talents we can win state.  "Imposible is Nothing" he said.   This year Greece won the Euro 2004 tournament.  Not only that in the final three games they played they held their oponents scoreless.  Now thats something, especially since they wouldnt be what i would call the worlds greatest team.  so we wonder how do they do this??? its  called unity.  they pulled together to keep behind the ball and then counter attacked.  total brilliance.  so they win.  This is life baby.  If we pull together we will be unstopable.  People may push us, but nothing will happen if we are all together.  They may penatrate, but they will not score.  So now as we enter High School i urge you to pull together an not get demolashed and we can do the demolishing
