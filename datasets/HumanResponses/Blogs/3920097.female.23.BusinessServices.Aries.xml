      After a fun-filled week of watching and analyzing the Democratic National Convention, I started wondering what issues were being tossed to the wayside as politicians from both ends of the spectrum continue to focus their misguided energies on the war on terrorism. I do not mean to belittle this noble cause in anyway, but as the present administration has already demonstrated, we cannot rely on brute force and unilateral action to deal with terrorists that we can not even find. So my mind wandered to domestic matters and the more I thought - the angrier I became. I began thinking about how less and less people are obtaining a minimum of a GED diploma. Or the fact that this government is more intent on spending money on metal detectors than computers or books for public schools. Or that the present administration would rather provide private school vouchers for kids showing promise in inner city schools rather than deal with the inner city schools themselves thereby perpetuating the hopelessness of public education as a whole. Not all public schools are in such disarray but the public suburban schools that are well-funded are being funded by the parents who are locally taxed to support the curriculum. The low-income areas are obviously not going to be able to afford yet another tax on their meager earnings. The result is that you get a revolving door of poorly-educated youngsters who turn to the streets for an education that will inevitably harden them into believing that there is no way out and no where to go... The worst part is that when the politicians dissect the situation - they almost salivate at the prospect of playing the race card. Yes, there is a higher percentage of minorities in the inner cities who are on welfare or who are "low-income" but these families moved to the cities generations ago to find jobs, to make a better life for themselves. As they face a world that is increasing less welcoming to people without quality educations... They are trapped. They are misjudged by employers and ignored by the government. How can we constantly claim to promote diversity when the disparity between minorities and the rest of America continues to grow? One of my conservative friends tried to dissuade me by pointing a finger at the black community and said, look at the Jews, look at the Italians, and look at the Asians. There were all discriminated against at some point in American history and they were able to raise themselves up. Why is black America still struggling? It was an interesting comment but it only took a few seconds for me to come up with something that had always been staring at me in the face. Black Americans are not immigrants. They are more American then many of the Jews, Asians, etc that have come over in the past century and even the past 50 years. And they come with a past that is unlike any other race in America. We cannot continue to make diversity an issue if we do not address that slavery happened. Racism exists to this day, pure and simple. There is no way around this fact. The Civil Rights Movement only really caught fire in the late 50's and continued on through the 70's. In my eyes, the struggle continues on today. To ask why Blacks have not been as financially successful as Jews is like comparing apples to oranges. Jews may have faced xenophobia and religious discrimination but they did not face hundreds of years of oppression in America... This practice inevitably left a mark on the evolution of American society. I would not propose that Blacks today should be given reparations as Rev. Al Sharpton would suggest but it would be ludicrous to claim that America's dark history has not affected the American psyche in regards to Black Americans today. That it has not affected their opportunities to flourish like many of the white immigrants that have come to the US. At a minimum, our country should be providing ample tools with which ANY American can gain the education they desire. If we are serious about making this country more equal and more just, we must commit ourselves to improving access to education to all people, regardless of their race, gender, sexual preference or religious affiliation. We need to provide incentives and a reasonable wage for good teachers to move to inner cities to teach in the public schools that need their help the most. We need to provide updated textbooks and computers for these schools so the inner city students are keeping up with the evolving technological, social, political and economic trends. And most of all, all public schools need to incite these children to be proud of who they are and where they come from. Growing up, all we ever hear about is European History and how it affected America's independence. As the melting pot of the world, it is ignorant and harmful to not also include African and Latin America history, the two cultures that make up so much of the current American population. Perhaps if we can get minorities to be proud of their cultures' past accomplishments, we can propel them into the future, with the knowledge in hand, that no matter how many obstacles there are, they can all achieve what they put their minds to, because they have done it before.

      Hey - this post is to remind my peeps that my roommate and I are throwing a party on Saturday, July 31st starting at 2 PM. It should be a good time and definitely bring friends - the more the merrier I say! Give me a call or email me at  urlLink maryleenemeric@yahoo.com  for further details.  In other news, while picking up some relatives at the airport last Sunday, I actually had the "Culo"&nbsp;song (by Pitbull) yelled at me while I was jogging through one of the sky bridges. It was a large group of Mexicans whistling and then singing the song to me as I ran by. This is funny to me for many reasons. One - I am Puerto Rican and speak Spanish fluently (although I look like a white girl) so I could understand what they were singing. Two - I was literallly joking about this song to my friends the day before saying that was going to be the new pick up line for latinas... and Three - who the hell does that in the first place. Are there no limits to the absurd ways men will try to get a girl's attention? I smiled only because I was taken aback by how funny the whole situation was... but it did cheer me up ;)&nbsp; Maybe their tactic worked afterall...

      Bush declined an invitation by the NAACP to speak at their yearly convention (meanwhile Kerry is planning to attend). At first glance I thought that it was simply cowardice on the part of Bush not wanting to confront the opposition he knows will be there waiting for him. And why shouldn't he be scared? The man has single-handedly managed to alienate himself not only from the vast majority of the moderate to left-leaning voters and the international community at large but has also worked his damnedest to ensure that we continue to live in an unequal, divided society - propogating ridiculous bigotted agendas and empty rhetoric such as the No Child Left Behind Act and the same-sex marriage amendment and opposing Affirmative Action and much needed social programs to get minorites on equal footing with white americans.  Let us not forget the infamous line by Dubya: "What an impressive crowd: the haves, and the have-mores. Some people call you the elite, I call you my base." If this is truly the mentality of our current president then we are in bigger trouble that we had ever imagined. Maybe cowardice isn't what is keeping Bush from addressing the NAACP. Perhaps it is something much more sinister. Perhaps it is Arrogance - a frightful indifference and ambivalence to a large percentage of the population that he has found unnecessary to maintain his seat in the White House. Anyway why not? If the Supreme Court could put him there in the first place - then who is to say that it could not happen again? And if this alleged "terrorist threat" allows for the upcoming elections to be postponed, who is to say that he cannot remain in the white house indefinitely, usurping the power of democracy with his well-proven scare tactics and empty threats.  The NAACP has every right to be shocked and offended by Bush's blatant disregard for promoting diversity and racial progress in the United States. One can only hope that the minority voters who have stayed home in years past, having grown complacent to the unchanging tongue-in-cheek charade that is the American presidential election, will be incited by this last Bushism to get their ballots counted and help induce some real change in the White House before it's too late.

      Alright folks... I was forwarded this article this morning and found it echoed many of my sentiments so here it is...  Posted July 14, 2004  AN ELECTION POSTPONEMENT? (Courtesy of ToledoBlade.com)  AS AMERICA's electoral calendar accelerates toward November, Bush Administration officials are becoming increasingly active in promoting the idea that terrorists will take election events as the occasion for another attack. Now we learn also that the administration is looking at legal steps to postpone the elections if an attack occurs. It is thus time to look at exactly what might be in their minds.  National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, Vice President Dick Cheney, Attorney General John Ashcroft, FBI Director Robert Mueller - all of whom have been involved in public speculation on this issue - announce to the population in a late "October surprise" that a plot has been discovered that justifies raising the threat level to red.  On that basis, the Nov. 2 elections are postponed until security conditions are such that they can be held. "War president" George W. Bush remains in power in the meantime.  On the surface of it, what might be legitimate, solid intelligence might be indicating now that al-Qaeda, sore Iraqis, or someone else might consider that some of the electoral events might provide interesting targets for another act of terrorism in the American homeland.  In that case, prudence might suggest that contingency planning be carried out to figure out what might be done to assure that the elections take place in 2004 as scheduled, as they have for the past 215 years, in spite of the Civil War and two World Wars.  But the Bush administration doesn't deserve the benefit of the doubt on this subject.  Its use of intelligence in the run-up to the Iraq war, misinterpreting whatever it had on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and alleged links with al-Qaeda, makes any "intelligence" it would put forward to support an effort to postpone the elections very suspect. Without digging up bones, the Bush Administration also has as part of its antecedents the 2000 Florida fiasco, in the view of many a successful theft of the presidency.  Does it defy belief to imagine that this administration, if it were faced by a likely victory by Sen. John Kerry in November, might not look at options to not having to leave office in January?  By the way, postponing the elections would have no effect in any case: if there really were a threat it would still exist if the elections were rescheduled for a later date as well.  If raising this subject and these fears is a tactic by candidate Bush to scare the population into voting for him, or staying home on election day, they are ignoble to say the least.  If what we are seeing is a softening up of the population for some kind of a fast move in November, the idea needs to vanish from Bush Administration heads right now. If they want to tell us about a contingency plan in case of a terrorist attack between now and Nov. 2, let's hear one about how they would propose to hold the elections anyway, on schedule, with full public participation.  Devising a plan for dealing with elections in case of a monumental disaster is a worthy idea. But such a plan should be drafted in a calm, deliberative manner, not under the gun of a vaguely defined threat.

      Welcome one and all to my very first posting on my new blog. Since I am yet an amateur at this - I apologize for any blatant or offending stupidity that may reverberate around this site. That said, I am psyched to have a place to put down my thoughts and hopefully myself as well as any poor misguided readers that manage to find their way to my blog will come away from this site having at least engaged in something interesting (even if we do not always agree)  Since I was an International Politics and Economics major at Middlebury College, my interest in the political arena is strong so those who are allergic to any and all tidbits of political garble may want to stay from away from the political hotbuttons I may press from time to time. I also like to talk about sex and stupid women so perhaps those topics tickle your fancy a little more...  Please feel free to agree, disagree, discuss, etc on the postings... I would love to get a different point of view :)  Thanks for Reading, -Maryleen
