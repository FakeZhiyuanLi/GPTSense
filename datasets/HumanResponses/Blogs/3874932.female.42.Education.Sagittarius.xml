      Once we get our analysis going just a bit, we can invite the snpp group to come to the website and comment (this requires changing the internal settings so that non-members can comment at the site).&nbsp; Maybe they will, or maybe the won't, but I certainly would like to see a discussion of the&nbsp;competitive creativity theme. &nbsp;We can also invite people in the field that watch the Simpsons perhaps to come in an comment as well (Al comes to mind).

      I do remember that one of the themes we have been considering for the Simpsons is that participation in the group does seem to be in part about competitive creativity.&nbsp; I can't see our creative seniors, though, joining the Simpsons discussion list!  Are there other venues or types of products where competitive creativity is a motivation for consumption?&nbsp; Maybe even fashion?&nbsp; Or, online role playing games?  &nbsp;

      We need a plan of attack for our research project. I think we have a lot of knowledge about the Simpsons as a media product, but we haven't really deeply investigated the theoretical angle to apply. Originally we used&nbsp;the angle that there are marketing related and highly commercialized plot lines and that these together while subversive in nature reify traditional&nbsp;American ideals. We have also aaplied connectedness theory and brand community. I think this is a good place to start. We could study the communtiy and how it impacts consumption practices for the members. We can justify studying the Simpsons (as opposed to other media products) by saying this is the longest running tv program with a devoted fanbase that tackles current social issues and has an enormous impact on global audiences and pop culture. This isn't just a show, it is a socailly impacting media product, like Coca-Cola that gives people all over the world a perspective on America. Thoughts?

      OK, I'm not quite up to a plan yet....but I do have some ideas for themes.  Cultural literacy is important to the SNPP group, and one of the reasons they like the Simpsons is that (at least for the earlier "good" seasons) intelligent watching requires a degree of cultural literacy.  This kind of reminds me that I saw a review Ben Stein ("Win Ben Stein's money," and "God" on Drew Carey) did in the last couple of years claiming that the Simpsons was the best program of the 90s (or something like that).  Now, where did I see that!?!  I'm guessing that cultural literacy (in some guise) comes up in that review.

      Mary G. asked about outcomes of usage in the survey. In our discussion, I focused on adoption/non-adoption, number of uses, amount of use. However, I did overlook some attitudinal outcomes in the survey in which we might be interested -- items include  se-5a Learning about the internet makes me feel I can keep up with the times se-5b I feel more connected to family members because of the Internet se-5c I feel more connected to friends because of the Internet se-5d I would really like to learn to do more on the Internet se-5e I think I will use the Internet for more uses in the future se-5f I think it's important to limit my time on the Internet se-5g I'm concerned about my privacy and security on the Internet

      Reviewing results from interesting bits of relevant research -- like MaryG's summary of the Chen paper -- is useful to our thinking.  I read to many things and forget them right away.  Writing them out can help us remember and give us all a bit more to think about.

      Original Message-----From: Marye W. Subject: Senior Paper -- some ideas April 6 email  I was looking over the paper -- Here is an abbreviated story (we can split up some of these themes to investigate once we have a story):  Starts with Lifelong learning (or openness to experience or curiosity)  leads to an interest in cultural currency (you know, I think we could draw on some literature on "memes" perhaps -- we could spend some time really trying to understand the concept of cultural currency) +  Add a desire for cultural currency to the layers of self efficacy -- particularly technological self-efficacy (maybe strongly related to attitudes towards technology, right?) and internet self-efficacy (maybe general self-efficacy, we'll see).   Add And/or desire to connect to others  Can't happen without Stir in moderators /mediators?(barriers/facilitators -- we don't have to talk about this much, but we can acknowledge the descriptive stuff and the adoption/diffusion stuff we don't talk about elsewhere)  Leads to behavioral outcomesConnecting (communication), play, creativity, extension of offline interests into online environment and mostly -- it leads to more learning and desire to keep learning (a giant feedback loop) [or whatever else we want to include here]  Also leads to attitudinal outcomes Spectrum of opinion -- "it's just a tool that can enhance my life" all the way to "it's fascinating, intriguing, it's a magic carpet" [here's something we don't measure on the survey -- but we did code for enthusiasm I think] [maybe there's nothing in the middle of these endpoints]

      In Clark (2002), she conducted an online survey with 10 seniors, then followed up with chat room interviews about their experiences completing an online survey and the interview.&nbsp; Interestingly, one of her themes matches ours, "Computer Life:&nbsp; A Sense of Accomplishment and Confidence."&nbsp; However, an important theme she identified didn't come up in our interviews much:&nbsp; Living Alone:&nbsp; Loneliness, Memories and Coping.&nbsp; Perhaps her seniors were more housebound than ours?&nbsp; All of our informants seemed very involved and not the least lonely, although I can't recall asking them about this.&nbsp; Perhaps we should follow up via email with some informants and ask about the role the computer plays in combating loneliness?  &nbsp;

      Jennifer has given me some gerontology articles, one of which seems quite similar (too similar?!) to our survey data.&nbsp; They surveyed college students (100% Intenet users) and people from senior citizen centers (18% Internet users) and found some interesting results:   There was no difference b/t younger and older Internet users in terms of time spent using Internet per week.  Older internet users and non-users differed on one of the five personality factors (intellect/openness) and all demographic characteristics (younger, higher incomes, more education, better health).  Most interestingly, "older Internet users and non-users differed in a similar fashion as young and older adults did in two dimensions of psychological well-being.&nbsp; Older Internet users scored higher than non-users on personal growth and purpose in life.&nbsp; Similarly, young adults rated themselves higher than older adults on those two dimensions.&nbsp; In a sense, older Internet users were more like young adults than non-users" (p. 741).   What occurred to me is that perhaps we need to conduct our survey with 250 younger people for comparison purposes (Mary, remember Port's comments at my presentation?).&nbsp; Two alternatives are to 1) collect data from college students this fall, or 2) have IDC collect telephone data for us.&nbsp; If #2, I can try to get money from CRITO and/or use my discretionary money.  I can't figure out how to attached a pdf of the Chen and Persson (2002) article I'm referencing above, so I'll email it to you both.

      Maybe we need to think again about writing up themes.&nbsp; It seems like a long time ago, but  urlLink I did write a section on technology optimism and self-efficacy .&nbsp; I think curiosity/openness to learning, creativity and cosmopolitanism might be another one.&nbsp; And, weren't we talking about a section on evangelism?&nbsp; I don't have the emails we exchanged then because my inbox was corrupted and I lost everything.   Hmmm, we were also looking at life involvement or something like that, right? I suppose in terms of adoption and diffusion research life involvement would be akin to communications networks since more involved people have more communication and thus more options to hear about the advantages of the internet.   Someone might be interested in writing a methodology section.   In writing up technology and self-efficacy, I started with all of the output from NVIVO just on those themes and let the data suggest what I might say.&nbsp; I can also run analyses of which themes co-occured together -- so, for instance, if you're working with creativity, I can see which other themes most often ocurred together with it.&nbsp; Maybe as we write each section we will develop a model of how the constructs inter-relate.

      I think those seniors who are creative, or recognize the creative potential in them Internet are more likely to adopt. As are people who desire to be cosmopolitan. This comes out through the interviews, but I don't know about the survey data. I don't know how all these motivational forces or predictive antecedents are working together. I get lost trying to put the puzzle together and then I get lost trying to extract or disentangle the concepts.&nbsp; Ideas?

      Do you think there's any chance that we could get some of our seniors to participate in our blog?&nbsp;They could just comment -- they wouldn't have to post directly to the blog.  Maybe we could even ask anyone with parents and grandparents that are interested to participate.&nbsp; They might have some ideas as well.  Or, maybe no one will want to particpate in the blog!&nbsp; I taped a show last week for Beachview (University TV here at CSULB that goes on cable and isn't all that widely viewed) -- President Maxson thought it was one of the best segments he's done and the camera man really wanted to tell me about his 84 year old father and computers.&nbsp; I think there's interest in the topic.  Or maybe we could create a separate blog that was more selective for this group of people so that we could have them respond to specific issues and questions we might have.

      I was also surprised to see that Rogers mentions that self-efficacy predicts early adoption.  I will have to take a closer look at this literature.  Self-efficacy always brings up the question, with respect to what domain?  We used a measure called proactive coping -- there are a lot of different types of self-efficacy and this particular scale reminded me of some of our successful seniors.  There's only one problem: in our survey, adopters reported slightly (but significantly) lower proactive coping scores (if I read the logistic regression results correctly).  Everything else looks fine.  Age is negatively related to adoption.  Education is positively related to adoption. Technology optimism is related positively to adoption. And proactive coping is related -- negatively -- to adoption.  Technology discomfort does not predict non-adoption until you remove the group from the analysis that didn't self-adopt (someone else set up the connection for them).  Perhaps what we have here is an order effect.  The proactive coping scale came after scales where we asked adopters about their internet use and attitudes.  I wished perhaps that the curiosity scale items had come first now.  I'd like to have another theory though for why this happened.  Maybe non-adopters coped effectively with the internet using the simplest most direct method....they didn't adopt!

      In both the survey data and in our sample, curiosity predicts adoption.&nbsp; More curious people are more likely to adopt.&nbsp;   Traditional adoption and diffusion variable uses a variable called innovativeness. I haven't gotten a chance to look fully at the items that are used in our field for innovativeness, but some of those used in the (not very good) paper I just reviewed sound like curiosity to me.&nbsp; I think Mary is getting some papers that used the innovativeness construct, so we can take a look and see what we think.&nbsp;  On a related note, Rogers does mention that openness to learning is related to early adoption.&nbsp; We tried that construct and it factored three ways, so we've used curiosity instead.&nbsp;   So innovativeness, openness to learning and curiosity may measure similar ideas.&nbsp; I think we can mention all these literatures in our section on curiosity.

      I've spent some time going through Everett Rogers' book (a 4th edition was printed in 1995).&nbsp; He certainly has better examples and a better discussion of diffusion and adoption than I ever had in class.&nbsp; Concerning cosmpolite people -- the idea is that they are earlier adopters because they tend to look outside their local network of people for new ideas and innovations and are thus more independent thinkers.&nbsp; Later adopters are more likely to have adopted when others within their "local" network have adopted.&nbsp; The case of senior adoption is interesting because I think there's more of an early adopter/no adopter split.&nbsp; The first 25% that have adopted (I think that was IDC's number) may be just about all that will adopt.&nbsp; Fully 80% of our sample answered 1 on a 10 point scale, indicating that they have "no interest at all" in adopting the internet.&nbsp; The sample of folks that are still interested (above 5 on the scale) is so small that I can't even use any variables to predict who is still interested.  One thing that seems to be missing from our data is the year when Seniors adopted.&nbsp; I think I had this in an earlier version of the survey and I thought that Carol Glasheen had indicated that it was in the panel data, but it's not.

      Epiphany Part 2  MW and I had an IM date this morning. In our chat, we tried to identify the kernels of our paper and the potential contribution. We had another epiphany: there are two types of contributions – we have two different papers. I think MW and I are feeling this split might make handling the data and the findings easier since we really have two very different “bangs for our bucks.” MG will need to enter this discussion.  Paper 1: Diffusion Patterns in Seniors as a Cohort  Idea: Seniors who adopt technology are innovators among their cohort, but are often laggards with respect to the general population. The critical mass/tipping point for them to catch on is larger/longer. Once they do adopt they really do behave like innovators in many respects and are early in the adoption curve for their age cohort.  Contribution: Seniors exhibit a diffusion curve which is enveloped into the larger diffusion curve for the general population. Diffusion is likely to work like that – for various cohorts/populations the diffusion pattern follows a curve that is then aggregated to form what we think of as the general diffusion pattern.  Venue: I think this is managerially very relevant since Baby Boomers are entering the Senior zone (kicking and screaming and Botoxed) and managers will need to learn how to anticipate adoption patterns for people in this age cohort or for whom certain technologies are introduced post-workforce participation. Since I see it this way right now, I think it is JM-oriented.   Paper 2: Self-expression, Self-presentation and Creativity in Older Consumers  Idea: Seniors have different self-presentation., self-expression, and creativity motivations that appear to map onto the life stages identified by many scholars across sociology, psychology and gerontology.  Contribution: This cohort specifically in relation to these topics is understudied. As the market turns more “gray/Botoxed” understanding older consumers and they way they express and present creativity will be important for enhancing their opportunities to do so including market and new product implications.  Venue: Although, we have managerial relevance, I think it feels like JCR. It feels like a more academic understanding – once removed from practitioner application. I am open to other thoughts.

      A million years ago we talked about studying online senior communities. We could analyze thread data (assuming there is any relating to our topics). This might help us for now and/or lead into the more pointed inquiry about tech optimism and curiosity etc.  I've seen some active discussions on WebMD and Healthboards about various conditions relating to older people. The people posting claim to be our cohort of interest. I'm not sure what we can parse out regarding seniors interests in medical information and curiosity, cosmopolitanism, etc. There might be more tech/internet use-oriented message boards out there. Should we take a look-see? If there are insights to be had for free - cool. Though I do like the idea of more money to study exactly what we want to know.

      For the small group of people who say they haven't adopted "because they just haven't gotten around to it yet" (I think 35 or so), the only variable that is significant in separating them from people who don't seem to be at all interested is --  curiosity . Technology discomfort, technology optimism, proactive coping, age and even internet self-efficacy (the belief that one could learn the internet if one wanted) aren't related to a continuing interest in adoption (expressed as the belief that they just haven't gotten around to it yet). Education also isn't statistically significant at p  Curiosity also predicts number of online uses; however, it doesn't predict time spent online each week however.  Only internet self-efficacy (even after including internet skill) was related to amount of time spend online each week.  Given that curiosity as we measure it here is a "general" personality variable, it's interesting that it is implicated in several "stories" here.  Mary and Hope -- your doctoral students should be studying the role of curiosity in marketing!

      A series of items on our questionnaire involve attitudes about the internet (helps me stay more culturally current, more in touch with my family, I want to learn more about the internet) have a high Cronbach's alpha (.81) and can be summed together. The following factors predict more  positive  attitudes toward usage:    technology optimism  curiosity  technology discomfort (go figure, I double checked the sign of the relationship, but more uncomfortable people had more positive attitudes)   A proactive coping style was not related to attitudes towards internet usage.

      OK -- I've been doing some runs this morning. The data behaves better if I remove from the non-adopters the group of people (about 35) who say they're still interested in adopting but haven't yet. When I do that:   age is negatively related to adoption  education level is positively related to adoption  Metro area (more or less rural vs urban) isn't quite significant   More interesting:   curiosity is positvely related to adoption  coping is NEGATIVELY related to adoption (but the there is no zero order relationship -- it becomes negative once other variables are included)  technology optimism is positively related to adoption  technology discomfort is not related to adoption (however, when you remove the seniors who were substantially helped in their adoption, then technology discomfort is negatively related to adoption).   I still want to look at use of other technologies, but have to figure out how to construct that from what I have.

      From a 2002  JBR  authored by Fareena Sultan, based on longitudinal panel data collected by a research firm and collected between 2Q95 (when 21.7% of the sample had adopted to 2Q99 (when 66.1 percent of the sample had adopted the internet):    Early adopters were more innovative (on a 4 item psychographic measure) than later adopters  Early adopters were more likely to consider tech items to be fun  Early adopters were more affluent  Early adopters are more aware of new technologies  The amount of money spent on ISP was positively related to innovativeness

      The following points come from a relatively interesting and well-done study published in  JM  by Steenkamp, Hofstede and Wedel (1999), "A Cross-National Investigation into the Individual and National Cultural Antecedents of Consumer Innovativeness."   Our knowledge of why consumers differ in their innovativeness is still sparse (Gatignon and Robertson 1991)  Studies have found the disposition of innovativeness to positively correlated with optimum stimulus level, independence, extraversion, impulsivity, risk taking, tolerance of amubiguity, inner directedness, capacity for status, and flexibility and negatively correlated with dogmatism, conservatism, need for structure and need for clarity (Foxall 1988; Steenkamp and Baumgartner 1992; Venkatraman and Price 1990; Zuckerman 1979). [sidebar: another study I looked at shows that dogmatism is not related to early internet adoption, which doesn't surprise me.]  Findings from the empirical portion (which is crosscultural and includes several EU countries) of the paper are as follows:   Conservation (conservatism) lessens innovativeness  Consumer ethnocentrism reduces innovativeness  A more favorable attitude toward the past lessens innovativeness   The cultural findings probably aren't of interest to us -- but here they are:   Degree of individualism in a culture increases innovativeness  Degree of uncertainty avoidance in a culture decreases innovativeness  Degree of masculinity in a culture enhances innovativeness  There are some interactions between culture and personality that are interesting, but not relevant to our study.   Oh, and as concerns age:   The authors used age as a control variable -- as in Venkatraman and Price (1990), age is associated with reduced innovativeness.

      One important theme we mustn't forget is that a number of seniors were motivated by wanting to keep up with the times, "not be a dinosaur."  Is this simply lifelong learning?

      In an interview in 2001, Everett Rogers mentions that one of the puzzles in innovation and diffusion research is why someone who adopts an innovation is willing and often very eager to tell other people about it, especially in a competitive environment. "For instance, with each additional farmer who adopted hybrid seed corn -- the typical farmer got a 20% increase in yield -- in the aggregate means a larger supply of corn and lower prices.  Eventually, that is exactly what happened. Nevertheless, and fully understanding that, most Midwestern farmers were eager to tell their neighbor about this new seed that would increase corn yields and eventaully lower the price they paid for their increased yields..." (p.389).  He does speculate as to why people tell others -- for instance, if you tell someone about a good movie, and they enjoy it too, the recommendation reflects well on you.  Enthusiasm for an innovation is another he suggests...

      This is from a Baumgartner and Stennkamp  International Journal of Research in Marketing  (1996), "Exploratory Consumer Buying Behavior: Conceptualization and Measurement."  I'm not sure their scale/findings are of great interest to us, but some of what they say about innovativeness and curiosity in their review and development may be of interest.  From a paper on exploratory  acquisition of products (EAP) and exploratory info seeking (EIS).  "Consumers who are high in EAP enjoy taking chances in buying unfamiliar products, are willing to try out new and innovative products, value variety in making product choices, and change their purchase behavior in an effort to attain stimulating consumption experiences" (124-125). Can this be said of our adopting seniors?  In any case, here's a tidbit on curiosity: "It is generally acknowledged that curiosity is a powerful motive underlying cognitive forms of exploratory behavior (Berlyne 1978; Fowler 1965; Voss and Keller 1983).  Berlyne (1963) proposed that need for cognition was a determinant of cognitive stimulation seeking and Olson et al. (1984) have shown that Petty and Cacioppo's Need for Cognition scale correlates significantly with a variety of measures of curiosity, including Trait Curiosity" (p. 129).  "...our framework suggests that...risk taking, innovativeness, and variety seeking in product purchase and curiosity-motivated search for information share a common characteristic in that they offer the potential for stimulating experiences and are motivated, at least in part, by a desire to adjust actual stimulation to the most preferred level." I do think our curious seniors were seeking stimulation.

      MG and I met in Boston (we missed you!!) and had a few epiphanies that I thought I’d try out on you: We are not dealing with opinion leadership b/c it is not product category specific, nor product specific nor brand specific. Our seniors are “use evangelists” for the various uses the technology has, not the above. They do not discuss attributes etc, only the capabilities. We are not dealing with mavens since we do not have consumers with high market knowledge. Again it is “use evangelism.” We are not even dealing with consumer evangelists since again it is use oriented and not brand, category etc. Recall, our seniors do not recall their mode of internet connection let alone their platform, their configuration, where they bought it, or the brand. Their evangelism is oriented toward the fantastic uses the technology has.  Also, We are not dealing with creativity, as Cz… analyzes it since it requires: a domain (a field of inquiry), gatekeepers (to that domain), a contribution to that domain or one that alters/creates a domain (read here recognition). The Cz… creativity is formal. He calls what we observe “creative perhaps, brilliant,” but not creativity. I think we’re dealing with expression (self, group, etc.). And these people’s use of technology to be expressive (as opposed to mastery etc.). I know I’m into self-expression and self-presentation, but I think it IS HERE. I think that is what we see as creative endeavor – construction of self. I’m going with a Goffman-esque rationale for some of this behavior. We are dealing with curiosity as an antecedent state – either inherent quality, or life stage prompted. It might be a lifelong interest or hobby or an emerging on that corresponds to keeper of the meaning etc.  Do these resonate with you?

      Social integration is part of what makes it more likely an innovation will be adopted -- we have this (I think) coded in our data as "life involvement/openness to learning."  Maybe we should separate the two given that life involvement seems to be a suggestion that one is actively integrated into social networks, and thus more likely to learn about advantages and uses of the Internet.

        What I learned from Midgley and Dowling's 1978 "Innovativeness: The concept and its measurement"        One can write a lot of pages explaining a really simple idea. (1) Time of adoption does not = innovativeness because the measurement is contaminated by communication effects. An otherwise innovative individual may not adopt an innovation right away because it doesn't diffuse through his network as fast as someone else's so (2) The best way to measure innovativeness in general is cross-sectionally -- looking at adoption behavior across a range of products.  "There is little doubt that the cross-sectional technique suffers from fewer problems of respondent recall than does the direct time of adoption method and may therefore be a more practical measure to employ. However, the view that it is a surrogate for time of adoption is a misconception; its value derives because it measures a more meaningful construct of innovativeness" (p. 231).  The authors advocate distinguishing between "innate innovativeness" -- a generalized cross-product innovativeness and "actualized innovativeness" -- observed, innovative behavior.  Their proposed definition of innovativeness is "innovativeness is the degree to which an individual is receptive to new ideas and makes innovation decisions independently of the communicated experience of others" (p. 236).  The most interesting part   of the paper   for our uses  may be that authors suggest that psychological traits (perhaps dogmatism, empathy, achievement motivation and intelligence) and sociological variables (social participation, social integration -- hmmm is this "life involvement"? -- cosmopolitanism, social character and "so on") may be conceptualized as predicting innovativeness in some future research.  A third method of obtaining innovativeness measures is self-designation (e.g. Kohn and Jacoby 1973) wherein respondents are asked whether they are usually the first to buy new products. The authors do not like this approach. (Honestly, it doesn't sound like as bad an idea as the authors seem to think.)  The authors have an interest in showing at some point in the future that "innate innovators and innate noninnovators have different perceptions of the world in general..." (p. 239).  We do have a cross-sectional measure of sorts -- but the focus is (I think appropriately) on the technology category rather than innovativeness in general -- it involves ownership and use of various product categories (DVD player, cell phone, MP3 player -- although zero seniors owned an MP3 player --) -- this data was appended in our survey, so I have to figure out which items to add up into a variable measuring ownership of other technologies. Midgely and Dowling might object to this approach given that ownership of many of these technologies no longer constitutes innovation (e.g. cell phones) -- I'll have to figure out exactly how to label and use this "technology ownership/innovativeness" construct.  There is no empirical information in this  JCR , nor are there any items suggested for an "innate innovativeness measure."

      In the file of I can't believe  JCR  published this: Dickerson and Gentry learned that low origance (translation: un-artsy), high intellectance (intelligence) folks were more likely to be early adopters of computers. They needed to do research to figure this out!?!! They were also more likely to be "self-designated opinion leaders," and less likely to be a "culinary enthusiast."  Shockingly, individuals with experience with similar products (e.g. programmable pocket calculators, video TV games, pocket calculators, microwave ovens) were also more likely to adopt computers!!!?!! They were less likely to have speed dialing (low origance, high intellectance folks we are told are not big communicators)!  Homeowning folks with more education and higher income were more likely to adopt, as were people in the 30-45 age range (yawn).  Conclusion: "Our results provide general support that adopters of home computers have a profile similar to that individual: they are homebodies who are interested neither in the arts nor in innovations that would enhance their ability to communicate" ( p. 233).  An absolutely seminal work in computer adoption, indeed.

      In my reading on adoption and diffusion, I've run across a citation of two papers by Hirschman on Consumer Creativity.  The first is "Innovativeness, Novelty Seeking and Consumer Creativity" (1980),  JCR , December, 283-295.  The other one is "Consumer Creativity: Nature, Measure and Application," in  Theoretical Developments in Marketing , eds. Charles W. Lamb Jr. and Patrick Dunne, Chicaco: Amercian Marketing Assocaition, 162-165.  Hope, are these of interest to you?

      In looking at the market maven lit, I'm not sure how relevant it is to our study.  Our seniors who are evangelists seem more like opinion leaders (in a particular product category, computers) than market mavens (possessing generalized market knowledge).  I don't think they were advising people where to purchase computers, what type to buy, etc.  Rather, they were encouraging adoption of the product category.   Or, am I missing something here?

      Odds refer to a ratio of probabilities, while odds ratios refer to ratios of odds. Anyway, they aren't too hard to understand. Here's the example from Pampel:  In 1994, 29.5% of men and 13.1% of women reported ownership of guns. The odds of gun owership for men equal .295/(1-.295)=.418 which indicates that around 4 men own a gun for 10 who do not.  The odds of gun ownership for women = .151 which is (.131/.869) which indicates that about 1.5 women own a gun for 10 who do not.  The ratio of odds of men to women equal .418/.151 or 2.77 which means that the odds of gun ownership are nearly three times higher for men than for women.  In logistic regression, the dependent variable is ln(odds). Of course, we're predicting internet adoption rather than gun ownership!

      I keep forgetting about technology discomfort, a variable that Parasuraman measures in his technology readiness index and which we used on the survey.   Technology optimism and technology discomfort are two different variables.   What we coded in our qualitative data (I believe) is  fear .  I'm guessing that technology discomfort and fear are pretty close to the same thing.  The "fear/technology discomfort" theme should probably go in the section I drafted on technology optimism and self-efficacy/proactive coping.
