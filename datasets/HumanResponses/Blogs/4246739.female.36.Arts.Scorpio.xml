       urlLink Gienna Writes   Well, will you look at that? I can "Blog This" with my own blog.  It is early Sunday morning. I have posted two pictures (three if you count my profile pic), a poem, and excerpts from a short story I've been writing for about 30 years. OK, an exaggeration. But only a slight one.  A note on the poem   Analogy  : I had a really hard time with the narration and point of view. I know it is confusing because of the pronouns. But it didn't work in first or third person. I never write in second person. This is not the 1980s and I'm no Jay McInerney. But in this case it seemed right. If anyone has a suggestion as to how to ease the readability, or if that is even necessary, I'm open to it.  I don't usually write poetry. And when I do, I don't care so much if it is good or it is bad, or if it doesn't follow the "rules." My poems are very personal -- a way to get some emotion or idea out onto the page quickly. Often, they stem from ideas that are too limited for a short story.       "I never write in second person.

       He says, It is like You two are in a pool And the water is emotion.  You (he nods at you) Are up to your neck, Saying please come in.  You (he nods at him) Are outside the pool, Saying please get out.  After, you have coffee, And share a cookie. And agree you liked the analogy.  And he says, I like how he said You (he nods at you) Have gone off the deep end.

       Asleep in my bed, dreaming that the world is on fire. Awake in the dark, sticky with fear and the thick summer air, taste of burnt metal in my mouth. The sound of adult voices downstairs, urgent and hushed, drawing me from my dream world.  Perched atop the stairs on the second floor landing, looking down through the banister posts at my mother and my uncle Victor in the hall below.  My mother’s voice, questioning, uncertain: “Should I wake her?”  “No,” he says. “Just go.”  I want to say something, want to speak out.  I’m here, I’m awake.  But I can not find my voice.  My mother slips away without saying goodbye.     ***

      A quick note: My other  urlLink blog  is more  urlLink blog-like . If you're not interested in writing, or don't want to slog through the long posts on "Gienna Writes," you can  go to  " urlLink Gienna Rants " instead.

      I wanted to comment on Katie and Bob’s lame comments during the opening ceremonies of the Olympics. But  urlLink this blogger  did it first. Check out her other site,  urlLink leigh is a pony . It is hysterical, although I have no idea why. Leigh is registered on  urlLink Amazon , by the way. And yes, from what I gather, Leigh IS a pony.

       urlLink     urlLink     This picture is from the back of a bag of children’s cereal. That’s right, I eat kid’s cereal. And yes, sometimes I eat the cheap kind that comes in a bag. You got a problem with that?  OK, sometimes a shovel is just a shovel. But this is not a shovel. And if it is, it is not digging for gold. Or if it is, it is not digging for  that  kind of gold. On the bag, the shovel is described as “orange.” The actual piece is more flesh-colored.  And don't even get me started on the pink seashell or the red treasure chest. "Buried Deep." Good grief.

       urlLink     urlLink     This is the cover of my book about Celtic Mythology. Most authors don’t get to choose or even comment on the cover artwork for their books. If anyone had asked me, I would have said that Celtic warriors fought naked. These two fully dressed men are probably fighting over the Holy Grail. Because, you know, ancient mythology is all about Jesus.  It's still a good book, though.  urlLink Why don't you buy it?
