						   Yasas  Hmm, well I am very sleep deprived, listening to the new cd I bought (Destroy rock and roll-Milo),  and am writing this to you both as I chat to you on MSN (N). I went to see Ellies school play last night- Oliver. I was good, but we got home at 1 in the morning, then I had to wake up at 6 this morning. I don't actually think I should be writing this, so I'll stop and write later.  John  Oh, I thought, for fun, I would post some MSN conversations that I have had in the past, the first i'll post was the three of us on MSN last week. HAHA, what the fuck, i'm going to sleep.  ill do it another time

						   Hey guys, again just got up, have to make this one short-school starts soon.................  Anyway, yesterday was a shit day. Woke up at 9:30ish, found mum had gone to work. Again I was home alone, no matter-mum would be coming home in the afternoon.  Got dressed, breaky, etc. Then sat myself down and started writing the third post. I also logged on to MSN, and so I found that I spent the whole morning chatting on MSN to Max, You(N), and suprisingly Neil. He and I were arguing about many things beofre the telephone rang. "Hello". "Hey darling, it's mum". "Hi Mum, how are you going"? "I'm well, how are you"? "I'm doing ok". "I'm going to stay at Anna's house tonight, and Ellie is going to Lucy's place for the night". My day was set-it wasn't going to be good    It passed slowly. I had this essay for international studies that was on the effectiveness of the united nations. It took me an hour, then I had dinner. After that, back to msn. I had planned to talk to you two on msn at 8:30. HA! Yeah right...........  @ 8:15-chatting to Max, 8:45-Max goes to bed, 8:50-ring Em-she has to eat and will be on at 9:30.Forget it, i'm going to bed :(. 9:00-Natasha comes on "where is Em"?, 9:02- ring Em again "come on MSN". 9:05-phone rings- no doubt Em is canceling :| "Hello"? "Hey John, it's Matt"!   That was the best part of my day. I chatted to him for about ten minutes, and he really cheered me up from my depressed alone state. You know, he may be a yuppie at times, by Matt is a really sweet kind friend of mine, I think I was jelous of him for a while.  Anyway, got back to the computer and chatted to you two for a little while, you guys wern't very talkative, I got off MSN at 10:00, and went to bed depressed    John

						   Hey guys.     I've just woken up (I love Wednesdays off), and am boiling some water to make my breakfast-mini chicken dim sims! MMMMMMMmmmmmmmMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmm.   I haven't writen since Saturday, and you have both seen the site. I don't know how reguarly you will visit, but I will leave that up to you.  Yesterday I woke up at 6:20, and had a shower. I got all my shit togeather, then I went in to see Mum. I went in her room and SHOCK!!!!!!!! Her eyes were swolen up and she couldn't see anything. She had conjuctivitis. Poor thing, she stayed home, but she sems to have gone to work today, damn her slave driver bosses!  She gave me some money for the train and to pay you back Natasha, then I left with Ellie to the station. We bantered about her school, she was saying that there are heaps of gymnasts there, they have one peroid of classes in the morning and one in the afternoon, then are bused off to an executive school to learn gymnastics. She said that a friend of hers used to do that but now she can't afford it so she is in normal classes with Ellie.  We got on the train, and Ellie got off one stop later, at Newport. She met up with two other Melbourne Girls, and forgot about me straight away, thanks a bunch.  I was standing at the exit doors, so I could see the whole carrage. There were lots of tired people, one that stood out was a beutiful blond woman, she looked like a snow princess (I have no idea what the fuck that means, but then again, I am currently eating mni chicken dim sims, so it all makes sense). She was looking out the window, and was sitting in a 6 seat caral by herself. I stared at her for about 10 minutes, during which time I thought some crazythoughts- the main one was that I would find out where she lived by getting up really early, going to Werebee, then catching the train to the city and finding out what station she got on the train from, then getting off ot that station and waiting there for the day, then at night when she got off I would follow her home and serenade her from the street. There were five other guys in the carrage who were staring at her, probably longer that I was, and it was at this point that I realized that woman have such massive power over men. It has happened to me many times- at Wesley was the first major fuck up, at Clunes. Then at Imax, and now at Prinny Hill I am not willing to go through it again, so I'm not going to do anything that I might have were I somebody else   hehe, that guy is cool!  Anyway, I got to school at about 7:50, bought some soothers to ward off conjunctivitis, then saw you Natasha! We walked upstairs, and as usual we sat at the special table in the study area that looks over the courtyard. We chatted for a while, saw Mr Johnson walk across  the basketball court with his funny tibetan beanie, then Amy arrived. I'm not sure why, but she never spoke to me or looked at me, solely at you Natasha. It has been quite a while since I have spoken to her. Just before the bell, Fredrick arrived. We greeted him offhandedly. I can't remember the exact context, but you(Nat) said he had a small dick. He went red, and Amy (and I to a lesser extent) laughed heaps. He walked off, and we went 2 english.   I asked Justin whether he thought it would be allright for me to go to the student anti-john Howard protest, he said the zoo excursionn was compulsarry part of the course, and said it was my choice to make-just like that catholic minister in the IVF philosophy video.  After that we had International Studies, Farral was as usual a bitch . We had home group, and oddly rane walked in and said "Excuse me, just wondering if this homegroup was 11E"? She is an odd one, Castlemane eh! Then at recess, heaps was going on with you two under the stairs, so Fred and I went 2 the shop, then the park. We went with Tim. On our way back to school, we met up with Freg, Matt and Teishan, all of whom stayed in a seperate group to Fred, Tim and I on the way back to school. Teishan and Matt are starting to realize they don't like me. :p   Period 3 was legal, it went by slowly and painfully. The year 12 football hicks that sit next to me were discussing anal sex and their girlfriends-one was saying his cock had slipped while he was having sex doggy style and had gone in her arse, she ran to the other side of the room and screamed "WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING!?!?!?!?!?!" Another was saying he was trying to coax his girlfriend into having anal sex by saying he would 'lube up'. Anyway, it was gross.  Period 4 was Biology, and Mr Collins was in a wheelchair. The guy is insane. He has been teaching at Prinny Hill for 35 years, and still isnt principle. RETIRE BUD!  I had a really cool talk with Leo, my Vietnamese friend about the Viet Kong, eventually the bell went and I walked to the lockers. Alice saw me and hurried over. "Hey, get your lunch quickly, we have to gett out before Teishan comes". I hurredly opened my locker and just shoved my books in there, didn't have time to get my lunch, then ran downstairs. I met up with you(N), Alice and Fred, and we were about to leave when we said "where is Emily?' Hmmmmm, if there is one thing I have learned about you Ms Shaw, it is that you take your sweet time at times. Fred went in to rescue you, when he didn't comeback after 5 minutes I went in.   Lots of people were milling around the foyer, what happen next was like a scene out of an action film. You (E) were walking downstairs slowly. Teishan was with his year 12 ho's under the stairs, and saw you, and Fred was reaching out for me "get out, Teishan has seen Emily". Too late, I motioned to you (E) to come outside, Fred glared at Teishan, who was standing up, and we sprinted out of the foyer. You(N), Alice , Ruby, Alex and Max were already past the bike racks as we burst out, I yelled "RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN"! And I sprinted past you all and came to rest around the courner. We lost him, thank christ.  Coffee at Filous was ok, it was nice to be away from dickheads like Teishan and Matt, but unfortunately I didn't have any money. Ruby offered me some, but I made some bullshit excuse up not to, gentlemanly of me eh?  We finished and walked gradually back to the park, Alex and Max invited me to go to some anime thing at the nova, I said I would be interested in going, but had heaps of homework so probably couldnt go for the whole weekend.   We got to the drain thing that we usually sit on at lunch, but left just about immediately to get back to school on time. Got my books from my locker, then went to Philosophy. On the way I caught up with Hatters quickly, he said I could do my speccial political thing. WICKED!!!!!!!!!! I walked into Philosophy, and found you(N) sitting between Mia and Steph, with the only avalable seat next to Teshian. NOT HAPPY JAN.   Luckely I didn't have to sit next to him, because we went to the park for the class, very uni philosophy, but I enjoyed it. Matt made some unusual comments like "what does it matter if an animal feels pain all its life"? Rain and Isobelle had an argument with the rest of the class about banning smoking in pubs, then we walked back to the school.   Last period was classics, I sat next to Pearl, who said she was going to paint charicters from the video on Athens that we were watching, she ended up painting a flower (a good one too).   I got my International book at the end of school, then left with you (N). We got downstains at 10 past 3, waited for 5 minutes (we could see you[E] pashing Paolo, so we waited outside the school entry), then had to go.   We had a nice chat, but I couldn't see you(E) coming, I assumed incorrectly that you had gone with Paolo. We got to the boule club and Matt rode up in front of us. "I carry a message from (queen) Emily, should I tell you it"? "Whatever Matt". "Halt". "We can't, we are going to be late for Tanya". "Oh, ok". He rode off. We continued to walk, and you(E)and Matt caught up with us. You seemed as pissed of with us as I was with you two on Saturday. Natasha and I walked off, leaving you again with Matt. We picked up Tanya and Freg (unusually he seems to pop up afterschool regularly), and waited for the bus. It came, and you(N)left.   The conversation I had with you(E) and Matt was unusual. I was the one doing most of the talking. I was saying how I had been bullied because of my weight, Matt was quite taken aback by my frankness. He said he was going to the anime thing too, and then he invited me to his place. I declined as I wanted to straighten things out with you (E). I hope we began to.  Anyway , I've been writing this for three hours, time to finish up.  I think that the three of us are really good friends, and I want to keep things that way.  John

						   Hmmmm, Iíve had an interesting day . And I have to say, at the moment, interesting=ABSOLUTELY SHITE!!!  This morning AEST, the Athens Olympic games had its opening ceremony. It started at 3:30am, so I woke up at 3:00. Ellie and Mum were already awake, and were bickering with each other. I muttered "goodmorning", got a half full corn chip packet from the cupboard and went into the lounge room, where the TV was already on.  Channel  7 had a replay of the Sydney opening ceremony on, I arrived just as the torch lit the cauldren. Mum and Ellie came in, and we settled down and watched the opening ceremony. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!! It was modern, respected Greeces fantastic hstory, and was really well done. The American team didn't get a good clap, nor did Israil, but Iraq, Cyprus, Palestine and Greece got heaps of applause. The DJ that was playing was really good too.   The ceremony finished at 6 in the morning, and so instead of going back to sleep, I had a shower and did some more designes for my super *******. Ellie and Mum left for the chiropractor and then for Annas house to stay there for the night-Ellies best friend from Gelong is selling her family house in Preston, and so she is there for 'support'. Mum left me $30 for dinner for me and possibly you guys. So, since 8:30 this morning, I have been home alone, I am not coping well :( .  At around 9:00, I went on MSN for the first time in like three years, this Thai guy from Wesley was on, as were you Natasha! I chatted to both you and the Thai guy, and found the Thai guy was at the beginning more responsive than you. That was because he thought I was a female English teacher from his student dorm on bell street, where PANCH used to be. When he found out that wasn't me, he lost intrest. I did ask him about the presidential election in Thailand, then closed his box thing. As for my conversation with you, well it didn't last long. Basically most things I put on the table got a yeah or haha, eventually I got to the crux of the matter, whether you would be working on Sunday morning. You said you didnít know, but thought it would be likely.   After this I washed my dogs, both of whom have been itching their backs heaps, Lattes back actually started bleedng. We had hoped it would stop if we washed them, but they sit next to me now on the couch itching themselves madly.  Anyway, at about 12:00, You (Natasha) rang me and told me that you wern't working on Sunday morning. FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT IS FINALLY GOING TO HAPPEN!!!!!!!!!!!  You said you had rang Emily, but she was at her grandmothers house, and would be getting back at 5:00.   So I spent the afternoon waiting for you to ring back. I was going to go to Altona to do some shopping, but thought I might miss your call, so I waited, and waited, and waited.  I watched a fantastic game from Athens of vollyball between Germany and Cuba, it was so close, in the end Germany won by a point. That match went for two and a half hours, it finished at 6:00. You (Natasha) had told me that you would ring me at 5:00, so I waited until 7:00 before ringing you. I didn't get through, but then you rang me straight back. You told me that you had gotten through to Emily, she had organised to go to Pablo's place until 9:30, and had wanted your mum to pick her up and drive you both to my place. Your Mum had said she didn't want to be driving around at that time of night, so again it was all called off.  I am here, stuck in the middle and on the point of tears (I am totally serious), i've waisted a whole fucking day waiting for you two, and you have both called the whole thing off, what the fuck am I supposed to do now? Fuck i'm pissed of right now.  John

						   Hey guys!   I don't really know what to say, but that has never stoped me when I talk to you!  I actually just thought of this, as I was on the train home. As you both know, I plan to go overseas at the end of the year, and thought this would be a good way to keep up with you, at least from where I am.  Anyway, today was a fairly busy day! I have a sprained wrist (which is healing really fast!), and have had a few days off school, so I was worried about what work I had missed out on while I was away. I caught the train to Melbourne Central station this morning, then walked to Swanston Street and caught the Moreland tram. I walk to the doors and in the window of the tram I see Tim! I greet him, and we start talking. I tell him about my bike accident, and he tells me that Mr Collins-my biology teacher- has broken his leg, and was hobbling around school yesterday. We chatter some more, and arrive at Melbourne Uni. A man gets on the back doors of the tram. He is wearing a large black trenchcoat and has really long black mangly hair. Tim and I continue to talk, and he sits behind where Tim is sitting. We arrive at the stop near the cemetary, and the man turns around and says "Sorry guys, I couldn't help overhearing you, it looks really bad mate '[gesturing at my arm in a sling] (Tim and I were talking about something totally differant). I nod and shake his hand. He asks us where we are from, and I say we are from Melbourne, and are going to school. "Oh yeah, I'm from Perth. It is lovely here in Melbourne, but it sure as fuck is cold. I have caught so many colds and viruses over here, they have been like, yeah, shit [snorts his nose], fuck they are bad". Tim and I nod, and I discreetly wipe my hand as best I can. We see our stop rapidly approching and so we stand, shake his hand one last time then get off the tram.   We continue to talk, then arrive at school. Tim, who has his lockers with the year 10's, departs on the second level and I walk to the third level. Then I see you Natasha, and we talk briefly. I get my books and walk down the corridor with you and discuss Saturday night with you, you say you can't come because you are working, and I am really pissed off, and i mean really. I go to the biology room and you go to lit. I meet up with Rose and vanessa at the end of the corridor, and I banter with Rose about bio, then she tells me " I had the strangest dream last night, all the people from the central Australia trip were on a new trip organised by Mr Bull, we were going to Spain, but got lost, so we had to sleep on a coal train". She gigles and I nod my head. I tell her that Peter won't probably come because I have a mediation session with him. "Yeah, you know he really hates you, he says stuff like.............god I hate that fucker and his mediation". Ha, well !@#$$%$#@#$%%@ !#. I don't tell her that, but it has been going through my mind ever since. Anyway, who should turn the corner but the man himself, Peter, who yells to all of us, "he isnt here guys", and then motions erotically to his crotch, as if guiding a plane to land. Tim and I decide to go for a walk with Leo............................Hold up a sec, this is getting boring, lets change the pace a bit.  I don't really know what I am going to use this for, I suppose just to note down how I feel at the moment. Well, i'm in the dumps. Firstly, I had my last mediation session today with Peter, it really wasn't pleasant. basically Peter came out the victor, he has no punishment for his actions, and I am told that I have to stop insulting him. Thanks a bunch.   Anyway, Ellie is being a pain in the arse at the moment, she is going through puberty at the moment and is really cranky with me heaps. Mum is as always really stressed and tired, I really worry for her, but what can I do about it? Tell her to stop work?  Anyway guys, i'm really stressed today. I wish we had met up on Saturday, I really needed to catch up with you both...........  John
