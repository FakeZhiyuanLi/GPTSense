      i love the way we can hold hands, and it mean nothing more than friendship. i love the way we can talk. i love the way we can look at each other. i love the way we hug. i love the way we can be ourselves around each other. i love the way and all the ways we are together.

       the last chapter of the fairy tale is over.&nbsp; forever in our memories, never far from thought.    &nbsp;  we all learned a lot about ourselves.    &nbsp;  the end.   &nbsp;    &nbsp;   Las cienega just smiled... "see ya around"    Y   &nbsp;

       i wish i could change the world.&nbsp; make everything the way i want it.&nbsp; but, then i guess it wouldn't be so "fun".&nbsp; you are still on my mind constantly.&nbsp; i think about the way you sit.&nbsp; the way you laugh.&nbsp; the way your lips move when you talk.     &nbsp;   i think about your gestures as if you were here with me right now in the same room.&nbsp; i wish you were.     &nbsp;   i just know i will never have the connection we have, with anyone else.&nbsp; and it tears me up to pieces inside my heart.&nbsp; no matter the akward silences, or anything.&nbsp; i just want to lean in and kiss you.&nbsp; like no one is watching.     &nbsp;   i want bear hugs.&nbsp; so big, you crush me a little.&nbsp; i want them to last forever.&nbsp; and have that feeling never go away.     &nbsp;   I'll stop the world and melt with you    you've seen the difference and it'sgetting better all the time&nbsp;    there's nothing you and I won't do    I'll stop the world and melt with you

       i felt fine today.&nbsp; why shouldn't i?&nbsp; it's not like we were more than what we were.&nbsp; i guess i thought it would hit me harder.&nbsp; since i take everything to heart, and fall too easily.&nbsp; at least i felt fine today.    &nbsp;  yesterday my stomach was churning at 100 miles per minute all day at work.&nbsp; i felt sick, and couldn't get the situation off my mind.&nbsp; i didn't tell you.&nbsp; i didn't want you to know.&nbsp; the sinking feeling didn't go away til i saw you.&nbsp; till i saw your eyes, and knew no matter what, i would be okay.    &nbsp;  i don't know why i get such a calming feeling when i'm around you.&nbsp; we had an instant attraction/friendship.&nbsp; but, i'm scared what i say will make you run the opposite way.&nbsp; but i need you in my life.&nbsp; not in  that  way, but in a best friend/big brother way.&nbsp; although, i am older.&nbsp; but, those are just details.    &nbsp;  i've been typing this entry for three hours.&nbsp; i'm reaching for all the right words.&nbsp; but they don't seem to be in reach.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  maybe i should stop while i'm ahead.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   i thought about you all day at work.&nbsp; everytime the phone rang, i hoped it was you. &nbsp;     &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Take it back, take it all back now   The things i gave, like the taste of my kiss on your lips,   I miss that now   I can't try any harder than i do   All the reasons i gave, excuses i made for you   Are broken in two   All the things left undiscovered   Leave me empty and left to wonderI need you   All the things left undiscovered   Leave me waiting and left to wonder   I need you    &nbsp;  Yeah I need you    &nbsp;  Don't walk away    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Y

       i don't hate you.&nbsp; i don't blame me or you.&nbsp; i will keep all my promises.&nbsp; i would never break a promise, especially to   you . &nbsp; it just means it was one more night of making us closer.    &nbsp;  we make mistakes, we are human.&nbsp; i'm glad i got to know you that way.&nbsp; my heart does hurt,  but just a little .    &nbsp;  you made a long drive, for me.&nbsp; i'm glad you did it.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  your eyes are still amazing.&nbsp; it's like reading a book when staring into them.&nbsp; but i can't look too long, or my emotions will take over.&nbsp; i've never looked into a friends eyes like i do yours.&nbsp; i wish more people were able to feel what i feel when i do.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  just don't ever forget.   And I hold you close in the back of my mind&nbsp;Feels so good but damn it makes me hurt&nbsp;And I'm too scared to know how I feel about you now&nbsp;Las cienega just smiled...

      i still get tingles thinking about it.  even butterflies in my tummy.  things went better than expected.  the connection was so wonderful.  i want to live the last hour over and over again.    just when life is going normal, you are thrown a curve ball.  i held on to the curve ball.  as it whisked me around.  from one thing to the next.  i want to do it all over again.  and not change anything about it.  over and over.   how can we keep this simple.     you held my hand and walked me home why you gave me that kiss  it was somethin like this  and made me go oh oh  you wiped my tears got rid of all my fears  why did you have to go guess it wasn't enough

       You see  everything  you see every part   You see all my light and you love my dark   You dig everything of which I'm   ashamed     There's not anything to which you can't relate    And you're still here

      It’s easier to run Replacing this pain with something more It’s so much easier to go Than face all this pain here all alone Something has been taken from deep inside of me The secret I’ve kept locked away no one can ever see Wounds so deep they never show they never go away Like moving pictures in my head for years and years they’ve played (If I could change I would take back the pain I would) (Retrace every wrong move that I made I would) (If I could stand up and take the blame I would) (If I could take all the shame to the grave I would) (If I could change I would take back the pain I would) (Retrace every wrong move that I made I would) (If I could stand up and take the blame I would) (I would take all my shame to the grave) It’s easier to runReplacing this pain with something numb It’s so much easier to go Than face all this pain here all alone Sometimes I remember the darkness of my past Bringing back these memories I wish I didn’t have Sometimes I think of letting go and never looking back And never moving forward so there’d never be a path (If I could change I would take back the pain I would) (Retrace every wrong move that I made I would) (If I could stand up and take the blame I would) (If I could take all the shame to the grave I would) (If I could change I would take back the pain I would) (Retrace every wrong move that I made I would) (If I could stand up and take the blame I would) (I would take all my shame to the grave) Just watching in the sunAll of my helplessness inside Pretending I don’t feel misplaced It’s so much simpler to change It’s easier to run Replacing this pain with something numb It’s so much easier to go Than face all this pain here all alon eIt’s easier to run (If I could change I would take back the pain I would) (Retrace every wrong move that I made)It’s easier to go(If I could change I would take back the pain I would) (Retrace every wrong move that I made I would) (If I could stand up and take the blame I would)(I would take all my shame to the grave)

       A soul mate doesn't necessarily have to be a love partner. A soul mate can be a parent, a sibling, a best friend, a helpful neighbor, a favorite teacher, or simply a compassionate stranger who helps youat a time of great need, then disappears from your life.
