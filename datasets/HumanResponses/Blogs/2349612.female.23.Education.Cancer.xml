      song of the day:  Round and round and round and round Round and round and round and round  History sits and she tells her stories Bitter and twisted without power Sitting watching feeding her jealous mouth The future looks back to learn her lessons Memories fade while experience beckons I'm caught in the middle which way should I go  This generation is full of religion Fed up with a diet of nothing Give me the real thing flowing through my veins This is the day, this is the hour Show me the truth cause I want to be blinded I wanna run, which way should I go  Gravity's pulling me, but heaven is calling me and My head's spinning the world's twisted My head's twisted the world's spinning My head's spinning the world's twisted My head's twisted the world's spinning round, around  ~deliriou5?

      i like feeling i'm in control of at least a small part of my life.  even that's not an easy thing to do.  i can't make my dad get along w/ me and vice versa.  i can't make g-ma better.  i can't do lots.  i think that's why i like driving.  i'm in charge of the car, the music, the scenery, the route, and it's a break from reality.  it's a good thing.  i'm not in control of my classes... i've been loosely following but having some issues with some details in lie algebras for awhile... i'm about 4 chapters behind on the homework problems too... expecting he'll want them last day of class... this is bad.  i'm not in control of complex analysis... mostly because the "midterm" we have due next week is the first long involved assignment he's given in like a month and a half, and took forever to get original stuff back to us... b/c of that, i didn't put as much time into studying it, and now i feel behind in there too... oops... this is bad.  i'm not in control of real analysis... my homeworks are crummy, my midterm was crummy... i'm just hoping i pass... i've been trying, he's told me he sees very good improvement over the semester, but is still concerned about my level of understanding... my mind just has a hard time thinking like an analyst, so sue me.  algebra,... algebra is my friend.  at least that much is true... and hopefully next semester graph theory will still be my best friend of a class like it was in undergrad.  mostly now that i'm sitting still and looking ahead to the last week and a half of classes, i have no idea how i'm going to pull it all off... blah.  so you know what i can be in control of?  christmas cards... 5 down, 95 to go.  this is something i can do and be done with by monday and be proud of.  =)   should be doing homework, but um... yeah... just for me, i need to feel like i'm working on something i'm not already starting 4200 miles behind on.  math time resumes tomorrow.  night.

      back in jersey after a relatively eventful few days in pittsburgh.  wednesday was long, but uneventful.  i woke up at 4am, left my apartment a little before 5am, drove eric to the newark airport and took of straight from there for pittsburgh, got in around 11:30am... easy drive and beautiful weather.  i stayed with mom's younger sister priscilla and her family for the weekend, in addition to my uncle and two cousins, they have 6 parrots, 2 dogs, a cat, a fish, and a rabbit... i was roommates with the rabbit for the week... he runs races around his cage around 5am every day and is good at trying to escape =P  thursday was obviously thanksgiving... my mom and brother drove up from TN on wednesday, and my cousin heather (not one of aunt priscilla's kids) came over for a bit to visit too (she lives in pittsburgh too)... we all had thanksgiving dinner at roy (my step-grandpa)'s apartment, and then went to visit w/ g-ma in the nursing home... i always tell myself she's a little slower each time b/c she's tired or something, but her memory is definitely gradually declining and that's weird and hard... she's still her, still knows us, still has a good sense of humor and is interested in what we're up to, but she's ready to "go home", is bored, is depressed, is frustrated, and is slipping that it's harder and harder to have a real conversation with her that involves more than yes/no, lots of waiting, and short half sentence answers.  the main reason mom and my brother were up is that my step g-pa has been worried that someone should sort through g-ma's stuff in storage since she'll never be in shape to go down and sort through it, so most of the weekend was spent doing that... it's kinda weird b/c this is the kind of thing you'd think you'd be doing after she's gone, but mom, ryan, and i worked for quite some time... she had like 40 filing boxes full of stuff somewhat sorted that goes back for generations before her... i enjoyed reading christmas letters from my great grandparents over the span of 30-40 years... looking through old pictures and stuff that belonged to my uncle jonathan (mom's little brother, died of cancer at age 6) and reading my grandparents' and great-grandparents' baby books.  we found my great-grandpa's diploma from when he graduated from seminary in 1922 with copies in latin and in german too!  i took most of the old books to distribute to people i thought would appreciate and mom and ryan took a lot of the general misc. since he's working on genealogy research... it was interesting but a lot of work!  yesterday was g-ma's 75th birthday, even though she insisted she was turning 88 and felt like 100.  we read her baby book to her and poems she had written in high school and her high school yearbook (one of her nicknames was "math whiz" -- apparently i come by it a little more honestly than i thought =P).  it was a good time... just strange w/ g-ma... like to illustrate her mind going, she insisted i take her for a stroll in her wheelchair on thursday afternoon, which is fine and normal, but insisted we were going "to the door".  so she had me push her down the hallway.  when we got to the glass door with a nice view i though she was talking about she told me to keep going down the hall and gave me definite directions at each turn until she finally led us to a dead end in the hallway, farther into the building than i've ever been before that just faced a plan solid window-less fire escape door... i told her there was nothing to see and i was going to take her back to her section of the building or at least that direction, she looked confused, and muttered something about tissues and looked distressed when i got her back near the rest of the family.    apparently friday, while mom ryan and i were going through storage and aunt pris was decorating g-ma's room for christmas, g-ma kept asking where ryan and priscilla were instead of kris (mom) and ryan... and priscilla kept telling her that *she* was priscilla and ryan and kris would be back later... when priscilla told her bye and that she was off to find me for lunch, g-ma said "oh, look for lara at the door at the end of the hall".  aunt pris also says that a few times (she comes to visit g-ma every sunday since she lives in town) g-ma's also gotten really upset when she's brought her back to her room and insisted the nurses moved all her stuff and that her room isn't hers... the nurses come by and tell her she's joking and should be nice, but g-ma has really gotten upset some of the time...  when she first had her strokes i was really upset and not dealing well with it... now that i've come more to terms with where she is, it's hard but i've somewhat adjusted to where she's at now... it's just hard to see her go downhill so noticeably in just 3 months, that yeah... end of thought... it's getting dark and i have tons of stuff i inherited from storage to get out of my car and up to my room.  later people!

      song in my head for the past 2 days:  Tommy played piano like a kid out in the rain  Then he lost his leg in Dallas  He was dancing with a train  They were all in love with dyin'  They were drinking from a fountain  That was pouring like an avalanche  Coming down the mountain   Some will die in hot pursuit  In fiery auto crashes  Some will die in hot pursuit  while sifting thru my ashes  Some will fall in love with life  and drink it from a fountain  that is pouring like an avalanche  coming down the mountain   I don't mind the sun sometimes  the images it shows  I can taste you on my lips  and smell you in my clothes  Cinammon and sugary  and softly spoken lies  You never know just how you look  through other peoples eyes

      from  urlLink Mind Media Brain Persuasion Test   Your Brain Usage Profile   Auditory : 30% Visual : 69% Left : 47% Right : 52%  l, you exhibit an even balance between left- and right- hemisphere dominance and a slight preference for visual over auditory processing. With a score this balanced, it is likely that you would have slightly different results each time you complete this self-assessment quiz.   You are a well-rounded person, distinctly individualistic and artistic, an active and multidimensional learner. At the same time, you are logical and disciplined, can operate well within an organization, and are sensitive towards others without losing objectivity. You are organized and goal-directed. Although a "thinking" individual, you "take in" entire situations readily and can act on intuition.   You sometimes tend to vacillate in your learning styles. Learning might take you longer than someone of equal intellect, but you will tend to be more thorough and retain the material longer than those other individuals. You will alternate between logic and impulse. This vacillation will not normally be intentional or deliberate, so you may experience anxiety in situations where you are not certain which aspect of yourself will be called on.   With a slight preference for visual processing, you tend to be encompassing in your perceptions, process along multidimensional paths and be active in your attacking of situations or learning.   Overall, you should feel content with your life and yourself. You are, perhaps, a little too critical of yourself -- and of others -- while maintaining an "openness" which tempers that tendency. Indecisiveness is a problem and your creativity may not be in keeping with your potential. Being a pragmatist, you downplay this aspect of yourself and focus on the more immediate, obvious and the more functional.

      pet peave: people who park so close to the driver's side of your car, you can't even open the door wide enough to throw your purse in.... not a good start to the day when i'm already running late for class and have to climb in through the passenger's side to get in my car!  money just spent on christmas stamps: $42.60 (how did i get to know so many people???)... see if you can tell how many US stamps i bought ($0.37), and how many international stamps ($0.80)... first one w/ the right answer wins 2 points =P

      dude, what a day...  so sunday margie and i went to church and then to see "brother bear" and otherwise putzed around and ran a few errands... it was a good day, and "brother bear" was pretty quality. =)  favorite comical line? kanai: ok, that's great, how about we just NOT talk, ok? coda: ok! then i'll sing! (intro into best song of the movie...) =)  favorite "moral of the story" line?  kanai is a human who hates bears but was turned into a bear, looking at a mural on a cave wall of a hunter with a spear and a bear, coda, an actual bear, comes up behind him coda: those monsters are really scary kanai: yeah... coda: especially when they have those sticks (it's all about seeing both sides of the story...)  dude, if only life had cartoon simplicity...   today, margie hung around campus all day while i had classes and then we had a good time for dinner at tgi fridays at the newark airport just before her flight... since then, i've been unmotivated to work on math, so i worked on printing out my christmas letter -- all 107 copies of it =P... only my printer was not being so agreeable... out of 120 sheets i tried to feed it, 13 came out messed up, but alas, it's done... =P... dave beagley suggested i threaten to turn it into a toaster, but apparently my printer doesn't succumb to threats... threatening to make it a microwave didn't work either...  mostly i think i was so easily irritated w/ the printer and so focused on that for the past several hours because i'm pretty irritated w/ my dad at present too... anyone who's talked to me in remotely recent history knows my famous mantra "oh i love my dad, we just get along better when there's a few states between us"... this is sooo true... i talked to him yesterday just fine and we had a nice chat... same the other times i've called home or vice versa this semester and while i'm away at school in general... tonight i called because i had asked him to have my brother call me last night and ryan never did call back... when i asked dad, "so could you have him call me *tonight*?" he got all annoyed with me as if i was asking the impossible and it was rude of me to ask that two nights in a row... whatever.. eventually ryan called to chat, but with dad periodically audible in the background "you're behind on your chores, why do you have to talk on the phone?"... i hadn't talked to ryan in the better part of two months, and it was super frustrating to end the chat with dad cussing at him in the background, him cussing back where i could hear him, and me pissed in general for having to deal with them... gotta love family...   random that i started w/ brother bear... i have no idea how to start looking at the flip side of the coin on this one though... if i had even a clue, maybe dad and me wouldn't spend so many hours yelling when we're actually in the same place at the same time... it's funny b/c people comment offhand sometimes when i relate dad stories that people fight because they're sooo similar... i hate that comment because for just about as long i can remember, i've been trying *not* to be like dad... i mean he has his qualities i respect, but he's also one of the most hypercritial people i know... pretty sure i've taken that and am super hyper critical towards myself but try (and think i succeed?) not being so much of others... when things don't go the way he wants them, he gets mad, starts yelling, and blames everyone else... when things don't go my way, i get mad, start beating up inanimate objects, and blame myself... dude, i've internalized my dad... that's great  on that note, i'm going to vote that i'm too tired to really be making sense right now and you can take the previous paragraph at whatever level of seriousity or joking you want....  in like 38 hours i'll be in pittsburgh =)  night

      dude, what a day!  so margie flew in late yesterday... we went to the rutgers wind ensemble concert w/ colleen, eric, ben, and sam, and had an excellent time... as always the music was awesome... the percussion section had the coolest instrument i've ever seen too... it was a crazy 5 foot stick full of bells, really crazily arranged that they banged on the floor periodically -- i want to make one of those =)  after that we all attacked starbucks for some good old "happiness in a cup" =) and later headed home... i was up til like 3 though half out of excitement for margie being here and half out of caffeine energy... whatever =P  today, margie and i went to NYC... it was a blast: saw statue of liberty, wall street, world trade center site, southern end of central park, ate lunch at the hello deli (of david letterman show fame.... actually talked to rupert gee =P), rockefeller center (saw them working on the big christmas tree there), st. patrick's cathedral, fao schwarz, and times square before heading home again =P later tonight we had dinner w/ trevor, leigh, eric, ben, scott, and sam, and it was hilarious as always... margie's already commented "i love your math people... can i come back and visit  again ???" =)  yay =) a fun day indeed. =)  she's also been going through all the books on my shelf and reminding me which are hilarious that i haven't looked at in forever...  777 mathematical conversation starters  for one =P dude... it's just fun to have a "we can sing at the top of our lungs with garth brooks songs on the radio for an hour and have a blast", math joke, known each other for awhile now kind of friend around for a bit. =)  yay for margie!!! =)  in other news, amanda (roommate here) apparently woke up to a random phone call for me... all she remembers are the words "valpo", "brother", and that they were in the area and wanted to see me... not a clue who... hopefully they'll catch me tomorrow... that would be durn spiffy whoever it is to have  another  buddy show up =)  three cheers for spiffy people and happy days.  the end =)

      dude... so thursday night is no math night which means food and cards.  we always play sheepshead and i usually end the night with a negative score, but i think i just set an all time record... -30 in one night!  mostly because of bad cards most of the night and a few times on account of obscure rules i didn't have quite straight... bother...  on the other hand, to make up for the worst night of cards ever, it's like the clearest sky ever out there!  after all the rain we've had lately -- i think the raritan river (maybe 150(?) feet out behind my apartment building) would literally swallow up my apartment if we got even just some more drizzle in the near future! -- it had to clear up eventually, but tonight is spectacular!  i just spent 30 minutes out there with my crummy book of constellations trying to figure them out... besides orion, the pleiades, and cassiopeia, pretty sure i found gemini, auriga, cephus, and canis major -- major party and a half!  there's also a huge star near orion (not sure if it's aldebran or sirius??) that flashes blue and orange... eric and me found it with his binoculars a couple of weeks ago and it was really bright tonight too... most excellent all around!  kinda in a weird mood... it's been a long week for many reasons... but margie comes tomorrow to visit!  yay for friends =)  top 10 thoughts of the evening (in no significant order whatsoever) 1) dude the stars are cool!... had to be a night like this that God told Abraham his descendents would be as many as the stars in the sky... or even clearer if that's possible... durn spiffy 2) where did my smarts go?  i mean, i know i'm not dumb or whatever, but there are times when i really wonder... yeah, whatever, not being a pessimist, not being a pessimist.... 3) i miss nicole... still... a lot... that'll be true for like forever... there's not a day since she died 11 weeks ago now that something doesn't make me think of her... and several times a day... today it was a song on the radio on the way to school that was also on the CD she gave all of us roommates for graduation in may... or when i'm a bit bummed/stressed/whatever and want to (or do) complain, i always end up seeing her in the back of my head... with her "listening face", not much to say until i was done yaking, and then "well, la, i still think you're a wonderful person",... yeah, i miss nicole 4) margie's coming!  margie's coming!  dude, only like 15 hours from now -- how awesome is that?!?!?! yay! =) 5) there is no spoon 6) i miss hugs... valpo was a full of hugs, international church of budapest was full of hugs... math grad school, not so full of hugs... which is fine, that's how it works, and i wouldn't trade the people here for anything, but dude, today i could use a hug 7) "i have run, i have crawled, i have scaled these city walls, but i still haven't found what i'm looking for" ~u2... dude that song's been in my head for a couple days! 8) do i tire other people out even half as much as i tire me out? =P 9) there's a website i like about exploding grapes in your microwave  urlLink here ... i think it's one of the greatest things i've ever read but never tried it... wonder what would happen if i did... well, maybe amanda would want to have my head... that wouldn't be good... but exploding fruit in the microwave?  c'mon, that's entertainment, right? (i know, pyro! pyro! pyro!.. whatever =P) 10) i have the best friends ever... i've been a bum this week, and you all are great =) yay for you =)  dude, ok, end of brain dump... time to watch some dumb tv i recorded while i was out tonight and get some sleep... gotta clean in the morning so that margie at least doesn't think i set out to make the place messy before she got here =)  good night all =P

      dude, one class down, one to go today...  i absolutely hate it when dr. sahi does his new "lecturing should be shared" thing.  he came in 3 classes ago and said "i forgot my notes, why don't you all take turns proving the theorems that i wanted to cover today." and handed over the chalk.  luckily the guy who went right before me took so long we never got around to me.  however, even though sahi's had his notes since, he's kept it up.  i've been picked out once so far.  i understand his philosophy.  he thinks by actively explaining the stuff to each other, we'll learn it better.  but (1) i don't like being singled out (2) we get a lot less done from all the long pauses incurred this way (3) proofs get so convoluted in class when the person proving the theorem doesn't know the stuff beforehand and so my notes turn into a lot of scratching out and scribbles trying to figure it out as we go (4) personally, as long as i'm still in the "class" and not the "lecturer" i guess i'm ok with the system although it just alters the pace of the course completely... but when i'm at the board without being prepared for it, i'm not learning more, i'm flustered and concerned i'm convoluting things just like everyone else does when they're up there... conclusion: yes it's good to make learning more interactive and to explain things to each other instead of being passive listeners... but this is so on the spot that it's not helping, it's making me dread going to the class instead!  on the other hand, spiffy things are going on in that class contentwise... i don't get all the details quite as well as i'd like, but the big picture is pretty clear.  it's a lie algebras class and so we've spent forever learning basic properties of lie algebras and special kinds of them... then we've gotten to the point of drawing these matrices and graphs to represent them instead... and pretty soon we'll be to the point of saying every single semisimple lie algebra that exists is represented by one of the diagrams/matrices in chapter 11 of our book, and every single one of those diagrams does actually correspond to some semisimple lie algebra -- a complete characterization.  that's absolutely beautiful.  *this* is why i study math... not for the headaches and frustration analysis gives me -- for the order behind it all and for the awesomeness of building big beautiful truths out of smaller ones.  dude, if only i understood what was going on in *all* of my classes like that, then this semester would be just a bit less stressful =P  ok, so pretty sure i have homework to write up and that's definitely not what i'm doing at present.  but rest assured... i'll be back =P

      it may have occured to you to wonder how any man in his senses thinks we're going to defeat a powerful conspiracy by sitting here growing winter vegetables and training performing bears.  indeed.  ... and no i'm not nuts... random quote from  that hideous strength  which i'm about halfway done reading.... quality book. =P  been online for 4 hours now at war with the rutgers servers and doing other stuff... got back 3 rolls of film today and wanted to scan and post photos and i'm finally nearly done uploading (i hope)... finally decided to use eden (general rutgers server) for extra storage space, and the firewalls and policies for using that from off campus are insanely retarded... oh well.  photo of the day:

      life = $$$... maaaan....  went out this morning to spend errands expecting to spend $28.68 plus tax and tips total... $12 on a much needed haircut and $16.68 with the coupon i had for an oil change, but not so much.... instead, ended up paying $14 for the haircut, and $655+ on the car (needed new front brake pads)... better safe than sorry but i hate having to spend that much when i'm already trying to pay off all kinds of other crazy stuff... who knows.  had lunch with mom... big news next week, but can't ramble about it until it's officially public news lest someone random come across here who shouldn't read about that i know is up... look for high pudwell drama here in another week and a half though -- life is going to get mighty entertaining soon.  otherwise reading lots...  that hideous strength  is a mighty quality book... read nearly 100 pages while waiting on my car this afternoon.... read it before but it's even better this time through.... gonna work on that like crazy tonight -- lord knows i sure can't afford to be spendin more money for a bit.  and yep folks, it's back -- i've got me a drawl. =P... sat down to talk to tracy phelps (in my class K-8... her dad's the janitor at the school where mom's principal... hadn't seen her in a good 4 years or so) and it got so thick you could cut it with a knife... i don't conscientiously do it, but i start talkin to people with a drawl and i pick one up for a bit again... try real hard to duplicate it when i've been out of tha area a bit and i cain't no matter how hard i try... but leave me here for a bit and i pick it up again in no time!  well, i'm off readin again... a good afternoon to all y'all.

      add some accents and the title gives you "my little brother" in hungarian (surprise surprise)... go figure =P  movie of the day?  runaway jury... wanted to see it in NJ this fall but never convinced anyone else they wanted to see it too... nice thing about being in memphis for a bit is one of the two theaters within 5 minutes of my house is a "$2 theater" meaning all tickets are $2/person no matter what time you go and they show all the movies that are done in all the other theaters... fun times.  so brother and i saw runaway jury tonight... i figured i had read the book for a class last spring and i like john cusack's movies usually so it should be fun... on a very general level the movie followed the book but for many many details not so much... nonetheless it was a quality film, and woulda been worth standard movie ticket prices had i seen it a few months ago too.  ran into bill maclin on the way out -- he used to go to our memphis church and hadn't seen him in years (he's like my parents age).  small world i guess. =P  then, brother and me went on a sonic run (three cheers for drive in restaurants and cherry limeades indeed!) and listening to my new elvis CD jessica gave me yesterday.... brother and me belted along the whole way... to "how do you know all these so good?" his response was "well, it's not so hard when you wake up every sunday to george klein's elvis hour"  dude.... my brother is a nut.  the end.

      so back home... i'm going to sell my dad... he's trying to be funny right now, but although he gets mad when we yak while he's trying to do stuff, he doesn't return the favor when we ask him to wait a minute.  so it was a good evening... saw jessica two weeks ago in philly, and now again tonight... after catching sandwiches for dinner and trading presents, we went to see the movie mona lisa smile... last time we visited i complained how she has a country station in philly and i can't pick up any NYC/NJ ones, and i was also debating about getting a billy joel double CD or an elvis double CD... so for a christmas present she mixed me up a country hits CD and an elvis CD... durn spiffy of her. =)  she did quite well.  enjoyed the movie, although it was different from how i expected... basic plot is that julia roberts is a new professor at an all girls school in the 1950s... she's single, unmarried, and working on her art history dissertation and wants to see her students be so passionate about their fields that they'll go further in their education/potential careers after college as well... however, brilliant and studious as they are, most of them have the single goal in life of getting married and being housewives.  it was all setting up for it to be a dichotomy of julia vs. the students and her converting them, but two scenes i didn't expect complicated things... in one of them, julia ran into a student she'd been encouraging to go to law school and was discussing future plans with her, when the student tells her "you don't understand... i just eloped this weekend -- i'm married!" "but what about yale?  what about law school?  you  can  do both, you don't have to choose!" "you're the one who told me i could be anything i wanted.  but you see being a housewife as giving up on your dreams.  that doesn't have to be it at all.  this  is  what i've always wanted.  and it's what i'm going to be.".... later in the movie another professor told her "you think you came here to teach them all a different way to do things... you came here to teach them all  your  way of doing things".  in the end, she left, a role model for all the students regardless of what they ended up doing, and going to learn more on her own... but it was interesting how the movie was publicized as julia roberts's character enlightening all these students, when they really showed her some faults in her own "liberalized" view of things... parts were slow, but it was still a quality film.  interesting for me, because the julia roberts character is halfway like me (definitely not completely)... a woman in academia, but in contact with a plethora of people not and trying to figure out how the two very different world views from these two life experiences can coincide/work together to understand each other... dude, i'm tired... no idea if it made sense or not... mom wants to see the movie too, so i'll probably end up seeing it again while i'm in town, and can think through it all again.  after the movie, jess and i went to get coffee and dessert and just chat a little... i really enjoy the fact that jess is a memphis friend i've known for forever but is accessible in NJ too... she's not in direct daily contact w/ me in NJ, but she's visited and knows the people there and my situation, and me similarly with her setup in philly... so we can visit in memphis, have fun in our HS hometown together and chat about our respective grad schools knowing full well what the other one is talking about, or we can hang out up northeast and get a taste of home again, enjoy our country music, chat about memphis, and have fun that way too... it's the first time i've had a friend that is part of two different places i live at at the same time, which is kinda nice... in memphis, she's an escape from family/memphis life to chat about NJ... in NJ she's a break from stresses there to chat about memphis... and many other things too, but it's kinda fun that way. =)  random observation of the day.  when i go get coffee or snacks at a restaurant down south with another friend, the waiter always pays for our coffee/sodas/whatever.  when i do that up north, no, whether it's midwest or northeast.  go figure.  the end. go memphis and yay for free coffee. =)

      dude, few things are better, more relaxing uses of a saturday afternoon than rolling up your sleeves, getting out a hose, a bucket, and a sponge, and handwashing your car.  it's all the better when you happen to be in a warm enough place that can even do this in shorts on the last weekend in december!  i've missed being able to do that in NJ since i live in an apartment instead of a house, but since i'm visiting here in memphis, i have the front driveway to do that as much as i please.  just spent over an hour out there even scrubbing down the wheels pretty good... not perfect, but the best they've looked in months, and i'll get it all again the day or two before i leave town again and get everything nice and shiny... next project?  vacuum out all the upholstry/floor mats, and treat the leather seats and clean the dash... brother's said before the only other people he knows who fuss over how their cars look as much as me are guys, but whatever... another thing to make me strange =P  on the other hand, to line up w/ my car-filled afternoon, dad's begun getting fussy on me again... we generally are at odds with each other over something or another that i'd rather just let go, but he keeps on going... he's fussed about little things all week, but we've basically kept the peace... i guess we did today too so far but he's starting to get to me... first he was mad b/c the mailman came while i was out in the driveway working on my car and i failed to get a package from the mailman that now we have to wait til monday to get.  then he chewed me out for not eating beets at lunch... then he threw stuff at me and yelled and told me "no matter what i do it's never good enough" when he gave me double A batteries for my fire alarm that died earlier in the week, and i told him "thanks, but it takes a 9V battery instead, these won't fit"... he's also been at least twice a day telling me that he's proud of me but doing math is unnatural and wouldn't i like to study something nice like plants or animals... he counts his animals every day -- that's math and that should be good enough for me... i guess my point by listing all of this is... he's starting to grate away at me again... all of these are pretty petty/silly things to argue about and i don't really want to, but dad has this habit of going and going and going and going, and it gets old fast... i dunno.  at any rate, had fun w/ jenny yesterday, in 4 hours i'll head over to jessica's for dinner and a movie (mona lisa smile) -- excited about that too. =)  the end for now. =)  yay for friends, and hopefully dad will learn to chill a little too. =)

      dude, so memphis jenny is hero of the day for giving me "memphis: the album" for my christmas present... she's been working since the summer on collecting good memphis/blues songs to burn me a homemade CD for a gift, and it's super spiffy. =)  i was way excited.  so my day?  mostly hanging out w/ jenny... hadn't seen her since she moved to ohio for grad school the first week of august, and she's leaving again sunday to go back, so i won't see her for months again... we went out to an indian restaurant and then to the pink palace for fun... they had a spiffy planetarium show of the constellations of the winter skies and the stories that go with them... super cool since i've been trying to learn them... then we saw an IMAX feature on chimpanzees in africa that was super cool as well... finally went bookstore-ing and starbucks-ing, and had a party overall... jenny quote of the day was "some of your friends say you're complicated?  dude, the rules of dealing with lara are pretty straightforward and simple... i should write an instruction manual!"  so who knows. =)  speaking of my friends who think i'm complicated, i'm generally laughed at by my non-memphis friends for locking my cars and double and triple checking them and for making sure everything is out of view in my car, including any slips of paper with writing on them... while jenny and i were in the pink palace (in a middle-class part of town, generally i feel really safe there) the car next to mine was broken into -- out of state plates and they had a bag sitting on the front seat that was taken... i'm NOT paranoid... just a product of my surroundings =P  it's interesting b/c jenny and jessica are the two HS friends i still keep really well in touch w/... both live out of state and are currently in grad school in their respective fields... it's really bizarre to me to run into other people from the past and chat about what they're doing... like 11pm candlelight church service on christmas eve... kara smallwood (in 6th - 8th grade with me) was there visiting from kansas, and david barton (in K-4th grade with me) was there, who's been in town all along, just hadn't seen him in like 12 years or so... and when you're talking to people you haven't seen in years it inevitably follows after the "hi, how are you?" that you ask "so what are you up to now?".... it feels like there's a small percentage of people in grad school like me, and otherwise for 90% of the people my age the answer is "oh, i'm still in town, meet my fiance/significant other... i (fill in straightforwardly explainable job like building houses, sell stuff, whatever)"... despite the stresses this semester, i really do love what i'm doing now... it's just kinda a dose of reality of the fact that what i'm up to with my life lately (studying and soon hopefully actively doing research mathematics) is rather abstract and not the common thing to do... its applicable to real life and i'm proud of it, but my dad's always on my case of why don't i do things that are more natural, like switch over to biology or something... whatever... at times though, comparing notes w/ the majority of my local friends i feel like in a way i've traded in other relationships for the world of academia... not in that i don't have a lot of good friends from a variety of places, but in that my life is so geared towards that, and grad school is definitely set up for people who are single and in charge of their own schedule, not leaving much time for too terribly much outside of it... i enjoy the way things are going now.... but it's just kinda interesting that each time i'm home the divergence between my life of studying and making my own plans as i want them (e.g. my massive road trip next month) and the lifestyle of settling down with spouse and kids and a local easily understandable job is more and more noticable... and i don't know how exactly to phrase what i think about that... i feel like i'm in yet another minority, which is usually neither bad nor good, just an observation, and another fact about me to confuse most everyone who knows me and is not in that category.    dude, i am so rambling. the end.  p.s. i hate being sick... not bad sick, just the same sniffles, sore throat from last week lingers on... whatever.  later.  p.s. #2: major accomplishment of the year -- with the new computer we got, yesterday we taught dad how to turn it on and off... today i got dad an email address and got him to write his first email.  welcome to the digital age, dad, who can't handle a remote control =)  major victory... woo-hah! =P

      home sweet home... or something like it. =P  i've been here like 14 hours and it's already nuts.  on the con side --  * the family's housesitting a cockatoo for a bit... his name's oswald... only he and frosty (our cockatoo) don't get along very well so they sit in their cages and scream at each other all day (usually frosty just screams for fun)... is it sad that i can tell their voices apart from across the house? * the battery in my fire alarm in my old room is dying, and thus the unit's having fits... i woke up at 5:09am today (after going to sleep at 3!) because it went off and woke me up... after determining the unit was just as old as the house and it meant nothing, i wacked it good and went back to sleep  on the pro side * dad and me haven't yelled yet... maybe we'll set a new record for length of time more or less getting along  and just plain weird?... * i just got one of my textbooks for fall semester in the mail... it was sent from... taiwan of all places!  go figure (i ordered it from amazon.com... not somewhere bizarre)  oh yeah, and 3 of my 4 grades for this semester got posted online... A, A, A... unfortunately the one that's not up is analysis, which is the one i'm actually worried about... grades aren't that significant in grad school as long as you pass quals, but As and Bs are acceptable, Cs are considered failing and i'm really not sure where i fall on the B/C cutoff w/ dr. ocone... we'll see... and when that one's posted i'll feel a lot better... but just seeing the three As made me happy and affirmed and stuff... go me.  and now i'm getting sick... blah... time to get my act together and hit up walgreens for some cough syrup fun.  vislat!

      so here i am back in memphis for the first time in 4 months...   really, i wasn't supposed to get in til tomorrow, but whatever... yesterday i drove the 6 hours from my place in jersey to aunt pris's house in pittsburgh no problem... after an evening of TV/movies w/ my cousins while aunt pris/uncle bob had to go to a funeral visitation, i got a bit of sleep and then was on the road again.... 12.5 hours from pittsburgh to memphis, most of it in crazy rain.  swtiched time zones along the way, so now even with me staying up insanely late like i usually do, i'm slightly more in pace with my family.  oh, here's the other exciting part -- mom dad and ryan's christmas present to themselves was to get a family computer -- it's kinda cool... flatscreen monitor... the tower has one side that's transparent and the insides light up in neon colors, so it's kinda fun looking too... and it's much faster than either of my old ancient machines... goal over break?  convince the parents that dsl/highspeed something or another is a worthwhile investment... for the time mom wanted to use the AOL dialiup trial CD she got at the post office this week, and hey unlimited dial up is better than nothing, right? =P  at any rate, insanely tired... (as i should be!  i've driving 1100+ miles in the last two days!)  time for some sleep.

      my last entry from jersey for a bit... it's 12:30... i've barely packed for the next 3 weeks and i head off tomorrow morning, not to be back here until mid-january -- joy!  besides church today, i managed to do a lot of cleaning, went and saw a local performance of the nutcracker w/ colleen, erin (her sister), eric, and scott... fun times indeed... now i won't see any of my math people until i get back here next month, or en route on my return trip... dude...  i'm tired... for several reasons. (1) had a minor cold/virus all weekend, energy sapped (2) end of semester = all the craziness i've put myself through for the past 4 months is finally having time to catch up with me ... and probably the most significant... (3) time to change places again...   (3) deserves the most explanation... like dude, i've been way excited about going back down south/back home for a bit now, so really yay... but i'll miss my NJ folks too... and that's the thing... as i'd guess is true for most people, whenever i move someplace and start over somewhere new, it's a chance to regroup and re-project myself... i've gotten a lot louder/more outgoing since grade school, but around certain people who have known me that long, i revert to being pretty quiet/passive/whatever, just because that's what i've always done around them... but even amongst groups of people that know me as louder, i'm a different lara in each one... memphis lara is a version of me i haven't had to be in several months, and these several months have changed me a lot i think, by the stressload of school and of all the crazy things in my personal life lately...  it's kinda like i was excited to be back at valpo last spring, but it was hard because i changed so much during my time in hungary... in the same way, i feel like i'm a very different lara than i was in august in some ways, and it'll be a little rough figuring out how i fit with my memphis people again after everything that's gone on.  beyond that, just switching gears between who i expect myself to be with different groups of people takes a lot of energy... go figure... ok, mental note, i'm coming back to this paragraph in a minute (*)  this is also going to be a draining break just as much as it will be energizing, just in totally different respects.  so much has gone on this semester that i've recognized but not really made myself emotionally deal with and think through or really process.  i always say driving's how i deal with stress, so i'm finally going to have time to sit still and think through a lot of this stuff in the next few days/weeks, and i don't know how i feel about that, although coming to terms with what all's gone on lately is a necessary thing.  but back to (*)... interesting my word choice of "who i expect myself to be" in different groups of people.  you'd think with how many times i write on here, or how many snail mail letters i write, or the vastness of my mass email audience, i'd consider myself to have lots of friends, and i do.  however, it's almost all what i consider to be "spazz lara"... there's this small core inside of me that i consider me, and then this huge cloud of crazy energy around it that "spazzes out" and that's what people get of me usually i think.  it's not that the "spazz" is not really me, because it's a very true part of me, but it's not my core.... but like out of all my tons of friends, who could name the one thing i want more than anything?  the one thing i'm most scared of?  the one thing i own that i value most?  i think a rare few could figure them out, but for the most part these are things that only my "core" knows that i don't really share.... is this normal?  or am i hiding from something?  if so, what and why?  dude... too philosophical for one night.  later.

      blah.  so for the first time since i moved to jersey, i've gotten sick... just in time for the holidays -- yuck.  it's not that terribly bad... just annoying since it's just not fun to be sick while travelling like i will be in another day and a half... it's all in my throat which is just pretty yucky right now.  accomplishments of the week?  mostly a lot of movie watching.  thursday, after my 4:30 am return home, i went to sleep at 6, woke up at 9, and finished reading _perelandra_ (2nd book in the c.s.lewis space trilogy... read them all before, had re-started perelandra earlier this month and had been too swamped with stuff to finish it until now)... then eric and sam came over and we watched all of star wars episode 4, and the beginning of the empire strikes back.... then being thursday, those of us still around had the requistite no math night and finished watching empire...  after the movie, leigh wanted to see christmas lights and colleen and i were excited too, so we decided it was a go... but none of the guys were too enthused, so we left them at colleen's place to bake christmas cookies while we went around driving and singing... it was lots of fun especially since this was the first time all semester that the three of us got to hang out without any of the guys... don't get me wrong, they're all great too, but one of the things about being a female in higher math is that you're definitely in the minority... so we have tons of fun hanging out with all the guys, but from time to time it's nice to have some just girl time, which doesn't come by all that often... i think that's one of the reasons my visit with jessica last weekend was so excellent -- not only was it away from things stressing me out, it was also some quality much needed girl time. =)  so yesterday i woke up feeling yucky, but nonetheless, the star wars marathon continued and just eric and me watched the return of the jedi... then colleen, sam, and scott came over for pizza and we watched citizen kane (never seen that before either)... pretty quality... ian came over for a bit after the movie too... fun all around, but by the end i was feeling pretty miserable sick-wise, so eric accompanied me on a 1am grocery store run to get some medicine, which is helping, but i'm definitely running low on energy and feeling yucky in general...  today, it was the rest of star wars marathon with eric over here to watch episodes 1 and 2 and feast on leftover raw veggies and soup... joy.  so star wars -- that pretty much sums up the last three days of my life -- joy. =P  actually, i did pretty much enjoy them, but there's so many weird names and weird details that this being my first time ever to see them confused me a bit... eric was good at explaining, but it's still a lot to keep track of.  hard to believe tonight i'm in a 2-bedroom new jersey apartment and in 4 nights i'll be in a large old drafty falling apart tennessee clampett-house just 15 miles from mississippi... the contrast is so large!  i love new jersey -- i'm gonna really actually miss my math people for the next few weeks, but on the other hand, the south fits like a glove too... i've been listening to country and yay south/dixie kinda music all week -- it won't be a white christmas, but it'll be the one i know best =)  and i'll even get to pick up my minor drawl for a bit too =)  i guess like the saying goes -- you can take the girl outta the south, but you can't take the south outta the girl.  agenda tomorrow?  church and packing for the long drive home agenda now?  save tons of emails off my computer (my yahoo account's about to explode!) and watch a dumb movie until my cold medicine rekicks in enough for me to go to sleep =P  good night all!

      that would be hungarian for "at the end!!!", which finally describes my semester.  today was a really long day of highs and lows... luckily the highs mostly all came after the lows, so now i'm tired but pretty happy. =)  i couldn't sleep last night (obviously from my last entry), so i was up til like 5 and woke up at 9... then it was study my brains out for analysis time... too bad it didn't pay off like i wanted it too... i honestly have learned a lot this semester, but by giving us the longest takehome exam ever, dr. ocone precluded the chance of seriously studying for the inclass half of the final, especially for those of us who struggle more with the class and were stuck for long periods of time on the takehome problems... the takehome problems are going to be my saving grace because regardless of how they went, they're definitely much much better than my answers to what he put in front of us this afternoon.  so i studied til like 2, then headed to campus.  our exam started at 2:50 and his comment was "oh, it's only 5 problems, then 2 extra credit ones... you have til 6 but i doubt it should take that long at all" uh, riiiiiiiiiiiiiiight... sam left way before anyone else, and he was there til at least 5 something... i was like the 5th to leave out of like a dozen students and i didn't leave til like 5:45... half of what i turned in was utter rubbish... i'm guessing i get a C (= "failing" in grad school terms), but i'm not the only one, so i'll deal.  next semester is a fresh start, and not as harsh a teacher (dr. ocone is nice, approachable, explains decently well (even if he is a little scatterbrained sometimes), etc., but even the people who are really good at analysis agreed that that was one of the longest exams they've ever had to deal with and to put a really insanely long take home part PLUS a really insanely long in class part together on the same week was really not nice of him)... my grade may not show it, but i put a lot of effort into that class, and i know i learned a lot in it, even if i'm still just not as quick at analysis as some of my friends... whatever.  ok, so the analysis exam was torment... i headed straight from the class to the bathroom to hurl and stop shaking, then composed myself enough to catch up with everyone else who had "finished" in the lobby...  i was so annoyed with the test, i decided not to wait on everyone else but to get some fresh air and get home to attack my new punching bag, and eric came with me... we set it up and attacked for awhile... i made myself a huge cup of cappuccino and we watched some old seinfeld reruns.... it was just good to calm down for a bit and beat up something for awhile. =)  that done, the people (= jared, scott, john, sam, eric, colleen, and me) went out to eat... we went to a thai restaurant that i had actually been to when i visited the campus here in march but didn't know where it was since... really really spicy food but really super good, and it was just fun to hang out and laugh for awhile.  after pad thai (the name of the restaurant) we went to starbucks to kill half an hour, then we drove over to the movie theater to meet up with ben and leigh, since we had advanced tickets for all 9 of us to see the 11:10pm showing of "the return of the king"  super super good movie -- i've only read the 1st book in the trilogy although i saw both of the first two movies in the trilogy before... there were a couple parts i was super grossed out and twice where i just closed my eyes and told eric (who was next to me) to tell me when the stuff i didn't like had gone away... luckily he's nice and didn't tell me i could open my eyes when stuff was still going on just to make me scream =)... ben (on the other side of eric) laughed at me a ton though as i curled up and hid from the screen at times... but yeah, despite my squirming, i really enjoyed it. =)  being a lord of the rings movie, of course we didn't get out until after 2:30am... but hey, i have no responsibility except for driving places on time for the next MONTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  so eric had pinky swore on monday that we'd go to dennys or ihop tonight, and when i said we were going, everyone but leigh (who is getting over strep throat and needed some sleep!) came along... had a great time in general... scott and me split an omelete and hash browns and i drank way more coffee than i should have for the middle of the night... not as shady as the valpo dennys (no stories about pimps and limo drivers tonight unfortunately =P), but it was in fact a dennys =P  now, it's 5am and here i am still awake and high on coffee =) and i think i'm gonna crash for about 3 hours... prof. treanor is in NJ half an hour away visiting her brother for christmas... she called last night while i was working on my exam and didn't want to disturb so i said either call back wednesday night or thursday morning, but i was seeing a late movie on wednesday... soooo, apparently she called at 10pm, when i was out en route to theater... i don't want to miss her 3 times in a row, so i figure if i get up at 8, i can entertain myself until she calls, (without her feeling bad for waking me up!) and then crash again after we chat... good plan, right?  besides, i got all the time i want to sleep between now and monday...  well, almost... there is a little structure here... (1) definitely going to church on sunday AM (2) my room turns into a disaster zone in times of stress, e.g. finals week, so i have quite a bit of cleaning/organizing to do (3) gotta pack for the next 3 weeks for galavanting halfway across the country and back! (4) and last but not least, eric freaked out last fall in budapest when he discovered i've never watched any of the star wars movies and although i recognize the more spotlight characters i don't know the plot at all,.... sooooo, when he came back from thanksgiving break, he brought all of them back with him, and is making me watch all 5 episodes that are out now before i go home for christmas... will be an adventure to be sure... he just says he's never met someone who has never seen them before and is curious to watch my "genuine first timer's reaction" being the anomaly i am who never grew up with star wars references as a regular part of my existence.  ok, dude, that sums up my day and my plans between now and monday... my semester is done, it's 5am and i've been up for 20 hours, and my last paragraph was too rambly for me to be allowed to write anymore... good night/morning =P

      that's what i have to say to pretty much 17 hours straight of analysis.  well, i stopped for lunch, dinner, and a starbucks run, but basically 10am til 3am that's what i did... and duuuuuude.  i've now written up something for every problem although the later in that span i got to them the less faith i have in the correctness of my solutions... whatever.  i spent a little over an hour trying to see even a pinpoint of daylight on the extra credit problem, but no cigar... whatever.  my billy joel dedicaiton to the exam: don't ask for help, you're all alone PRESSURE you'll have to answer to your own PRESSURE  i'm sure you'll have some cosmic rationale but here you are in the ninth two men out and three men on nowhere to look but inside where we all respond to pressure PRESSURE  is that not perfect or what?  unfortunately part of my response to "pressure" is to have so many things whirring around in my mind that i can't sleep (hence being up and writing an hour after i first tried to go to sleep... oops)... whatever, in a mere 15 hours my semester will be done... analysis can stop being the bane of my existence until next term starts over a month from now, and i can catch up with and deal with all the stressors that have added up since august to make this probably 4 of the most stressful months of my life... january = fresh start... duuuude, what a thought =)  i'm definitely wearing my new "cranky" toe socks to the exam tomorrow.  do dah.  night.

      dude, so algebra done -- woohoo... the exam was unexpectedly open book which is nice... but also makes me wonder what exactly our grade is based on... 4/5 of the problems could be just about directly copied from the book!  whatever.  now, all that stands between me and a happy end of semester is analysis.  analysis = not my friend.  i have 2 out of 5 problems done on the take home part of the final and haven't even started looking at studying stuff besides those problems.  today i should have worked on more but alas....  so first i woke up, studied for algebra (which turned out to be open book anyhow), took the algebra exam, then went home to make lunch... remembered i had stuff to box up and get to the post office, but discovered i didn't have packing tape, called eric, who also happened to need to mail stuff, and had a package wrapping party at his house... by the time we made it through the line at the post office, etc. it was already nearly 5... we went back to his place, and opened a package i got today -- christmas present from kristin (aka roommate... valpo roommate, not current roommate =P)... she gave me a pair of toe socks that say "cranky" on them with a frown face on each toe and a 5.5 foot tall inflatable punching bag... both completely cracked me up!  knowing how much stress i've been under this semester and that i always talk about punching things, she purposely gave me stress-relievers to (a) make me laugh (the socks -- how can you wear such a thing and not laugh =P) and (b) be a stress channeler (punching bag)... most excellent!  so after unwrapping those, spending forever inflating the punching bag, and having hot chocolate, it was time to meet up w/ other people to go to applebees for dinner... it was eric, me, scott, colleen, and john... made it home by 9 (had to deflate the punching bag enough to get it in my car =P), and started to work on analysis... getting nowhere, i ended up chatting on IM w/ eric who commented to me "so why don't we go looking for that abandoned ferry again or something?"  so yeah, not ferry hunting but other exciting things... first we drove down to U.S. 1 to see this huge legendary tree in front of a mobile home park that has 70,000+ christmas lights on it -- quite spectacular... then we took backroads on the return trip and found a dead end road in the middle of a field a bit mroe away from city lights than normal in NJ and looked at stars for an hour -- saw a LOT because it was such a clear night! -- absolutely amazing... quote:  me: so do you know what this means?  i just saw the big dipper AND the little dipper on the same night!  that's like a lifelong goal! eric: yup, that's me... eric rowland, fulfilling one lifelong goal at a time.  heh... besides the dippers, the usual cassiopeia, cephus, orion, taurus, canis major, pleiades... also learned lepus (spelling?) and found a double star in that which was really cool... the moon was only a half moon too so with our binoculars you could see craters on it by the border between the light and the shadowed part... most excellent.  so yeah, lots of stars, and then we took a picture of a cow crossing sign that has times below it (as if cows know when to cross the street?) on the way back that i had seen before... also jammed out to my new "billy joel: greatest hits" double CD all the way there and back... first CD that both me and eric own that we've come across since we've met!... duuuuuude,... all in all an entertaining analysis free 2 hours.  but yeah, tomorrow i'm gonna pay for this analysis-wise...unfortunately... at any rate, wish me luck! =P  night.

      dude, so it snowed enough with the risk of sleet that i woke up on time, but stayed here and wrote up algebra all morning instead of making it to church... first i've been awake and outright skipped in months... kinda wish i woulda gone, but i really didn't want to deal w/ the crazy snow/sleet traffic, whatever.  turned on the TV during breakfast to see the news about saddam -- craziness indeed... amanda and me actually watched bush's 5 minute speech at noon together... i think that's the first TV we've watched together all semester... or close to it... go figure.  since then i've spent 5 hours on one analysis problem and just now solved it.  headache indeed.  this class drives me nuts.  i really want to pass, i really want to understand, but it frazzles me no end.  earlier... me: so i think i've come to the conclusion that there's not enough time in the days between now and wednesday to finish this exam eric: yeah, i think there's not enough brain cells in my head to finish it... good work.  on the other hand, listening to my spiffy new billy joel double CD i picked up while out w/ jessica yesterday:  lyrics i am the entertainer and i know just where i stand another serenader and another long-haired band today i am your champion, i may have won your hearts but i know the game, you'll forget my name and i won't be here in another year if i don't stay on the charts

      With rusty cars and weeping willows, Keepin watch out in the yard, Just a snapshot of downhome Dixie, Could be anywhere you are,  In Carolina or in Georgia, Open arms are waitin for ya, Louisianna, yellow rose of San Antone, Arkansas, Mississippi, Old man river whispers to me, Carry on, Carry on, Sweet Southern Comfort carry on.  As I sit here I'm surrounded, By these priceless memories, I don't have to think about it, There's no place I'd rather be,  In Carolina or in Georgia, Smell the jasmine and magnollia, Sleepy Sweet home Alabama, Roll tide roll, Muddy water, Misssissippi, Blessed Graceland whispers to me, Carry on, Carry on, Sweet Southern Comfort, Carry on.  ... that song was on the radio this afternoon coming back to rutgers.  i liked it a lot. =)  i love jersey, NY, etc., but you can't ever get tired of being down South either. =)  yay.  so friends who invite you to disappear and forget about everything for a day when you really really need it are the best ever.  after what i wrote on here late thursday night, i woke up to an email yesterday morning from jessica, who is the coolest ever in my book right now.  she said if it worked in my schedule i was totally invited to just hang at her place for awhile.  so i drove yesterday, we went out to applebees and i got my requisite margarita, we rented two movies, and watched until like 2am, chatted til after 4am, i slept til 11, we made breakfast, and then went shopping half the day (i came back with 3 frank perretti novels from a used book store, a double CD of billy joel's greatest hits, and a double CD of dixie chicks live in concert) =)  having felt i was about to explode thursday night/most of friday, it was just awesome to take a break, hang out with an old friend (and her cat =P) and avoid everything causing me stress for awhile, take things easy, and just be able to ramble off the top of my head about everything going on... things that have been on my mind and some people around me daily are tired of hearing, as well as things on my mind for awhile that i haven't told anybody here but was good to be able to spout off about a little to someone completely outside my people dynamics here. =)  indeed, jessica is the coolest ever, and today was a much needed break and a super good day.  now, it's back to work... if i don't finish my algebra final take home part tonight i'm in big trouble for time to do analysis for the rest of the week.  later.

      so welcome to reading day.  classes done, two exams to go -- both have a take home part and an in class part.  i should have started one or the other today, but apparently not, and i think when i'm done typing here i'm going to crash.  i slept in until i woke up on my own at 12:30 this afternoon... watched 3 episodes of cosby show, and then ran errands... then putzed around chatting online until it was time to have the requisite "no math night" with the people.  however, by the time i had gotten there, scott, colleen, sam, and john had already left for the grocery store b/c scott was confused and told people that was the plan and i'd just pick up eric when i got to campus and meet them at the store... eric and me were both confused and slightly irked (not like mad but just like "what on earth are they doing???") and so after talking to scott on his cell, we started to drive to the store too... halfway there we realized neither of us really needed anything there, and since everyone else was 20 minutes ahead of us, we'd just let them deal, so we went back to eric's place and laughed at PDQ Bach songs for awhile.  when everyone else showed up, they made potato pancakes (latkes) and soup for everyone and i played cards w/ the guys... again a losing streak, but i tried... had a lot of almost farmers hands (the worst hands you can get in sheepshead).  after awhile, colleen had been leading people in baking cookies and convinced them all to help decorate.  i held back for a little and took a few pictures of everyone working then curled back up on the couch i had been on for cards... i got to thinking... the last time i did something baking-ish like that was with nicole... and the decorating cookies would have been a very nicole-like endeavor... i miss nicole.  also reminded me of our big christmas party we threw at my apartment in budapest last christmas and all those people i miss too... i've gotten emails and letters from several just this week too, and i miss them a ton.... but even more i miss nicole and that i'll never get to do holiday stuff or baking stuff or any of that with her again.  mostly then, while everyone else decorated, frosted, and ate cookies, i was in my own world thinking away.  eric tried to convince me to eat cookies, scott told me a couple times i needed to wake up, and jared actually asked me what was on my mind (and i gave him the half a sentence summary =P) but mostly people just let me be and carried on like normal, which is fine.  i stayed there, pretty quiet most of the rest of the night until everyone else left... then i did too... but instead of the normal 10 minutes to drive home, i took an extended hour-long version.  there's something about being on the open road, with barely any traffic, in the middle of the night that's relaxing and freeing... you can just kinda let your mind go... and it can race just as fast as you are going down the interstate.  i like driving a lot.  instead of clearing my mind, i think i just reorganized all the heavy things going on inside it right now and made for more to think about... whatever, i needed the drive.  mostly, i'm impressed i've made it down to the last week of the semester.  if i had known in august what all was going to happen in the past 4 months, i don't know where i would have chosen to be for all of it.  grad school is already mega stress.  add to that completely starting over and knowing no one while my primary support system is spread across the country/world.  add to that the uncertainty of whether or not i'm going to pass analysis and that i really don't know what the consequences of that are yet or not (will i have a job/funding next year???).  add to that that 15 people who are close to me or close to my friends have died in the past 3 months, 2 have been diagnosed with cancer, and that's a lot.  add to that that at this point so much has happened this semester that i just have very little faith in my own abilities to do anything anymore...   so yeah, basically january is a very very very much needed fresh start.  many many many more of you have so much more faith in me than i do in myself anymore.  i feel like i complain about the same things over and over and over and people are getting tired of hearing them... but they're still there nagging at me.... what i want more than anything right now is for someone to give me a hug, sit down w/ me and a pitcher of margaritas or something and just want to talk/listen for awhile until i just unsteam everything driving me nuts right now... mostly i just need a hug.  i'm tired.  i don't think algebra's going to get done well while i'm in this mood so i think i'm going to let myself crash.  wish me luck on the take homes, since i absolutely positively have to start them tomorrow =P  night

      the above would be my current lunch... how's that for a lunch menu at 4pm when i've only been up since 1?  go finals week. steve klee just said i get a thumbs up and a seal of approval just for that.  go me.  thought #1: it never ceases to crack me up that when you go to a liquor store (i keep ending up in states where you can't just buy alcohol in the grocery store... go figure) they put your stuff in a plain brown paper bag.  it's not like people can't guess that because you have a plain brown paper bag you probably have some kind of alcohol in it.  most other places that give you paper bags advertise on them anyhow.  but it's like despite the fact that everyone probably knows what you have inside the mysterious bag anyhow, they recognize the social stigma or whatever have you of having alcohol and are trying their darndest to disguise it... this makes me laugh.  the end  thought #2... what on earth is going on with my M&Ms?  check this out:    thought #3: duuuuuuuuuude  later

      It's the most wonderful time of the year: it's the last day of classes, we hope everyone passes, no more integrals here! It's the most wonderful time of the year!  It's the hap-happiest season of all: all those tensor constructions and homotopic notions now dash away all! It's the hap-happiest season of all!  There'll be exams for the taking, "no math" nights in the making, and sliding round out in the snow! there'll be scary test stories and tales of the glories of math quals so long, long ago.  It's the most wonderful time of the year: no more all night homeworking, round starbucks i'll be lurking now that finals are near -- It's the most wonderful time of the year!  ~new and improved lyrics courtesy of me =)

      so i just woke up from being in the middle of the most bizarre dream.  it's very very very rarely that i remember what i'm dreaming about when i wake up so i figured i'd start typing while it's still there.  there were 5 of us... me, my two younger pittsburgh cousins, and then two other little kids who i've already forgotten who they were, but i knew them no question while i was actually asleep.  we were in some huge house my head made up, and we left the rest of everyone else to finish decorating a christmas tree in the hallway.  but the hallway was weird.  it was a big across as a normal room, (hence christmas tree right in the middle of it) and at the very far end it was just plain open to the rest of the world... like if you looked down the hallway or a normal day you could just see the outside, not through a window, just right there... otherwise a typical hallway full of lots and lots of doors down both sides, most of them closed.  so the 5 of us, me by far the oldest and in charge of the rest, are decorating this tree... then i look up down the "open" end of the hallway and see a cyclone cloud coming down the hallway at us... it's only like a dozen doors away, so we assume time is of the essence and dash into the nearest doorway -- it happens to be a frozen over cornfield (told you my head is weird)... we all lie down on the ground, heads down to brace for the big hurricane like storm coming through and all i can think of is "just like in july -- when did memphis start getting hurricanes?" (i'm soooo weird)  we all close our eyes and wait, wishing there's time to warn the people we just left before going to decorate the tree.... then when we open them there's a clock there, it says 2:something am and we're confused by it... i get up and look out the door, the storm's still coming, only a few doors away now, so i go back to the rest of the crew...  next time we close our eyes and open them we're in a room full of sinks, the clock says 3:07, and we're waiting, with such things as mattresses to take cover under when the storm actually hits.  ....and then my alarm went off...  is that bizarre of what?  what on earth does it mean? (my theory on dreams is usually assorted images already in your head firing at random and putting themselves together in the back of your head, kinda filing them all away, and in that case it's all somewhat insignificant.)  i really have no clue, but it's often 6 months or more between when i actually have dreams i remember, so i had to start typing while i was still relatively clear on the details.  go figure =P  laugh away, and have a great day! =P

      dude, two concerts two consecutive nights.  last night was rutgers wind ensemble -- that's like the top band here.  eric and me went, as usual, and enjoyed it a bunch.  conversation on the way back from the concert eric: (commenting on people on campus w/ cars, etc., etc. etc... next semester our analysis class gets done 20 minutes before when his band rehearsal will be every week so i'm his "chauffer" then) me: so basically you're saying all it takes to be your best friend is to be able to drive you places? eric: (laughs) more or less, yeah me: what kind of best friend does that make  you ? eric: a shallow one me: oh, well you should work on that... be deeper! eric: (laughs really hard) that's the most hysterical thing you've said all day... be deeper!  maaan!  dude, enough of that...  so then tonight was symphony band concert.  eric's 1st assisting horn in that, and this was their one and only concert of the semester so instead of eric being my concert buddy since he was on stage... i met up with leigh, colleen, sam, john, and scott.  math party indeed.  it was awesome.  they played an really cool arrangement of "it is well with my soul" which i hadn't heard since the weekend i was in valpo for nicole's memorial service in september.  so that made me tear up, but in a good way.  they also played a really cool symphony called "la fiesta mexicana" that eric's been talking about all semester... often this semester he practiced on thursdays between algebra and "no math night" and instead of go home and back, i'd often bring a book and sit around and listen, so it was really cool to put together eric's horn parts with the whole orchestra and hear what i recognized in a totally different way!  super cool!  scott scared me during intermission -- he and i were at opposite ends of the row and he snuck up behind me, out of nowhere whispered "PIZZA!" in my ear and ran off -- i jumped, and when he got back to his seat, i gave him the pinky =P  back to the music -- on the 2nd movement of "la fiesta mexicana", eric had a really low note to hit all the sudden after sitting for a bit, which is hard to do, and he hit it perfectly, so after the concert tonight, the conversation was as follows: me: dude, good job! eric: i even hit the low A!  i screwed other things up, but i hit that A!  go me! me: for that you can be hero of the day, and starbucks is on me. eric: dude, i owe  you  money me: but how often is it that you get to be hero of the day?  and even more rarely how often do i offer to buy starbucks?  enjoy your status, and like all heroes of the day, take the starbucks.,.. well then again when potato cheese soup is hero of the day, it doesn't seem to mix well with starbucks, but that's another story eric: awesome, i'm a starbucks worthy hero of the day!  dude  ok, so in summary, the music was great, i love my math people, and i need some sleep -- tomorrow's my last day of classes of the semester -- i can't believe i've survived! yay. =)  good night!

BUT, my current return trip is gonna take over 2250 miles!  current lineup?  jan 8: drive from memphis, TN to st. louis, MO, have lunch with dave beagley, then drive from st. louis, MO to manteno, IL, spend night w/ g-ma pudwell jan 9: hanging out w/ grandma pudwell jan 10: drive from manteno, IL to madison, WI, track down and pick up scott there, drive from madison, WI to colleen's house near minneapolis, MN, spend night @ colleen's jan 11: hanging out @ colleen's jan 12: drive from minneapolis, MN, back through chicago, IL, to valparaiso, IN, (with scott and colleen!), spend the night on campus and hanging out w/ all the super cool people there jan 13: in valpo, attack math colloquium, morning chapel, and other fun stuff jan 14: drive from valparaiso, IN to pittsburgh, PA (turnpikes for 3 states in a row -- woo hah), spend night at aunt priscilla's house jan 15: around and about pittsburgh -- hopefully see grandma schumann/fischer up in cabot and track down my cousin heather, and maybe some downtown sightseeing for the people =P jan 16: drive from pittsburgh, PA to piscataway, NJ  think you should be on this schedule?  let me know =P  heh.  i don't think i can do too many more detours than i already am... i've managed to double the length of my return trip already -- this is gonna be great! =)  now if only i were better on focusing on right now!  today's been pretty productive but not enough... i had 3 classes... in between ran some errands and stuff and then the afternoon/evening just escaped.  my last class got out around 4:15.  then scott and i went to starbucks to study until 7ish... scott fell asleep and i worked hard on lie algebras, but yeah, whatever... went back to campus and picked up eric so we could go to the wind ensemble concert at 8... when that got out we went and bought tickets for everyone to see the final lord of the rings movie for next week (a crew of 9 of us going -- awesome!)... after that, i ended up going grocery shopping w/ eric and trevor and then got home at 11 something... since then i've been organizing, and not so much homeworking... need to write up what i did earlier and work like non-stop tomorrow... for now, i think it's time to crash.  to all a good night =P

      well, that in a second.  first some snow commentary.  36 hours straight of snow, piling up to 10 inches in my part of jersey -- absolutely insane!  makes for driving taking 3 to 4 times the usual amount of time (30 minutes to campus instead of 10, 2.5 hours to get to walmart and back yesterday w/ scott which is normally 15 minutes each way)... nuts!  but i love it!  can't wait til i get pictures back from all this mess... snow is one thing... starting out w/ the first sticking snow of the season being this huge, that's juts plain freakin awesome!  and now... my day without verbs... see if you can pick out which items to ask me about for the most entertaining stories... & enjoy =P  awake, breakfast, crazy snow, car, errands, train, new york, zanzibar, mango margarita, trek, slush, "free" hat, indian chant, rockefeller center, sparkly tree, pictures, taxi, race, slush, broadway, 42nd street, balcony, tap-dancers, encore, slush, penn station, train, car, people, monsters inc, brownies, duuuuuuude

      dude, i certainly must be... here it is 4am, on a night when i have no good reason to be up this late at all, yet nevertheless i am, having made an evening of listening to mannheim steamroller CDs and writing cards, now instead of going to sleep, i just filled out an online  urlLink handwriting analysis  just for kicks... highlights include: ( bold  is their comments,  italics  is my response)   Regarding letter size... you clicked "Very large". This implies that you have a driving need for social interaction. I would guess you're right at home at a party... as a matter of fact... let's face it, you're the LIFE of the party. People with very large handwriting are also able to juggle several things at the same time, but often get bored if they have to focus on one task too long.     well, kinda.  i like people, i like having lots of friends, and think they're all super cool, but i'm much more at home minding my own business.  that last comment on juggling things is very true though. =P    Concerning the letter slant of your sample (slant reveals emotional outlay)... you chose "Midway between vertical and hard right-slant". Your emotional outlay is exactly halfway between an introvert and an extrovert. So, you have the best of both worlds: the ability to think logically and make hard decisions and at the same time you can still be very emotional... which means that you can spend time and get along with both types of people.     dude, that's great... the brain persuasion test i took last week said i was a toss up between left and right brain thinker too... i'm just nuts i think =P... i think it's hilarious that most people i've had this discussion with automatically say i'm an extrovert when i very much consider myself an introvert... go figure    Looking at the letter "i", you chose "The dot is close to and directly above the stem". Dotting your "i" so close to the stem tells me you have a great eye for detail and a keen memory, too. I bet you never forget what people say to you and can recall it years later, especially..(blah blah blah)...     sometimes yes, and other times i'm the most oblivious person on earth =P    Oh boy... the letter "o"... this is a very insightful letter. When you picked "Exit loops on the right side", that told me you can be VERY secretive. As a matter of fact, the larger your inner loop, the more you tend to avoid giving complete and straight answers. You won't lie, but you won't just spout off information freely either. Your best defense is to answer questions with questions... "Would I say that?"     dude, not exactly that, but yeah... i think what most people get of me is real, but not at all what i consider "real" me.  often i think when i come across as the most hyper and out of control is when i'm the most honestly bummed and/or frustrated about things (but not always!) or i come across as more quiet and reserved when i'm most content (but again not always).  this habit of projecting the opposite makes me really hard to actually crack into i think, and only a few people ever are good at it.  again, pretty sure i'm just nuts. =P    This is a great quality, because when I asked about the slant of the humps in the letters "m" and "n"... you clicked on "Downhill slant". This tells me that you can be very diplomatic in difficult situations. Diplomacy indicates that you can say things in a way that will not offend others.     dude, and this also means i obsess over every word i'm going to say about anything halfway serious.... maybe that's why i come across as insanely silly so much of the time... then i don't have to overanalyze every word before i say it.  doht. =P    Excellent characteristic!!! When I asked about the shape of the tops of the humps in the letters "m" and "n", you chose "Vary between rounded and pointed". This is the best of both kind of thinkers. You can process information both in a cumulative/procedural fashion and also in a comprehensive/fast fashion. This means that you can adapt to the people around you. If you're with a slow talker, you can slow down and explain every detail. If you're talking to someone who only wants the "bottom-line", big picture facts, you can speed up your thinking.     maybe... but if this is true, again it means i'm just all mixed up and not decisively one thing or the other again! =P    This is an important trait! When I asked you how high the t-bar is crossed on the stem of the letter "t", you chose "Midway up the stem". This tells me that you set goals that are realistic, practical, and obtainable and that your self-esteem is good, but not super high. I would suspect you still have an aversion to taking too much of a risk and you'll hedge on the side of security.   The good news is your confidence is strong enough to leave a really bad situation and take those first key steps toward living your dreams. People that cross their "t's" in the upper middle are pragmatic and secure with themselves. But, there are still more dreams to achieve... so stretch yourself even more!     false.  for a few reasons.  (1) not much phases me, so if i want to do something, i make sure i do it sometime.  in the past 12 months i've lived in eastern europe, the midwest, the south, and now the east coast, mostly just because i love to travel and purposefully am making an effort to see the world... i have a habit of just kinda picking up, going, and doing as i see fit.  similar applys to non-travel things to do. (2) self esteem good but not super high?  well, i disagree for varying reasons i won't go into at present, whatever, moving right along     When asked how the t-bar ends, you chose "Knife point toward the right". This tells me that you are a bit "sarcastic". You see, sarcasm is a wonderful means of defending your ego. Often this sarcasm comes out as a wry sense of humor. People love that.... (etc. etc. etc.)    heh, yeah    This is a great trait! Concerning your lower case t's, the last question deals with the TILT of the t-bar. You chose "Upward toward sky"... which tells me that you're optimistic, forward thinking, and a self-starter. Optimism is one key trait of successful and happy people. So, even if your life sucks today, you automatically assume that it will be better tomorrow!     i'm an optimist?  how come i didn't know that?  i'm a think-too-much-to-be-too-optimistic type person i'd say.    When I asked you if the first letter of your signature was larger than the other letters, you indicated that it was. This tells me you have a strong sense of who you are and a healthy "ego". I mean ego in a good way... it takes an expanded sense of self-importance to get things done and demand the world give you what you deserve.   So, your larger letters in your signature indicate a tendency to show the world your self-assured and confident side. The larger the letters... the stronger the ego. If you want to know your full self-image, re-read the section on where you cross your t-bar.     dude, sense of who i am yes... self-assured, not as much.  but whatever, this is all fun and games, right?   =P  so that's what the "experts" have to say about me... go figure =P    ok, this is really not smart... up at 4:30 when i have a TON of work to do this weekend and i'm gonna end up pulling another series of near-all-nighters next week if i'm not careful!  really, good night!

      dude, i wonder if the grammar's any good up there... i'm missing a few accents, but that title *should* be "happy st. nicolas day!" in hungarian =)  indeed.  i wish i lived somewhere a little closer to my friends here... every year of college, my friend nicole would remind us to leave our shoes outside our doors for st. nick's day and she'd leave candy for us and a note.  it was really cute and i always looked forward to it.  last year, i was actually in hungary over st. nick's day and what i thought was the most awesome thing ever was how they celebrated.  here in the US st. nick's day is kinda lost and the whole season from thanksgiving through christmas is shopping-mania and commercial the whole way though.  in other places, and in my experience in hungary in particular, the commercial stuff w/ santa and all happens for st. nick's day on the 6th, and then christmas is kept sacred for jesus coming... no santa, since he's been out of the picture for nearly 3 weeks by then!  that was the coolest ever.   all this is to say, happy st. nick's day to you all.  i'm missing being able to do anything fun for it as i just have my one roommate, and pretty sure she'd be more confused by me than she already is if i told her she should leave her shoes outside her door before she goes to sleep. =P... and as usual, i miss nicole -- she was the coolest ever indeed. =P  ok, so on a less serious note, here's another chance to get points. =P tell me what the following means (if you're clever this shouldn't be hard) part A gets you 1 point, part B gets you 2, for a grand total of up to 3 points =P  (A) 03755, 08854, 08857, 15203, 15239, 16023, 19027, 19428, 21061, 27514, 29203, 29720, 32940, 33957, 38002, 38018, 38028, 38115, 38117, 38119, 38122, 38128, 38134, 38135, 38138, 38141, 38671, 43402, 43512, 45056, 46113, 46167, 46303, 46319, 46349, 46383, 46816, 49008, 50012, 53565, 55057, 55407, 55427, 55444, 60160, 60187, 60193, 60195, 60423, 60477, 60544, 60546, 60657, 60950, 60955, 63105, 77566, 80526, 82001, 84106, 97007, 97203, 98177  (B) 1033, 1035, 1063, 1134, 1525, 8110, 50100  good luck, and good night =P

      heh, what a way to phrase that... just got off the phone w/ my family.  i'm not licensed to say more at present, but the next few months promise to be entertaining all around.  pretty sure if we were added up to one person instead of the 4 of us, we'd qualify for "mid-life crisis" phase without question.  man, being totally vague, but quote of the week, courtesy of dad. =P  "yeah, sometimes life is like a soap opera.  when one crazy thing happens, you just gotta sit still and watch and wait for all the dominoes to fall before you do something else."  indeed, the end. =P

      dude!  so we have our first snowfall of the year here in NJ -- party indeed!  and like check out the current weather channel radar for the area:       it's gonna still be going for forever yet, and that's AWESOME!  we've probably gotten 3 to 4 (maybe a hair more) inches today so far (it's been snowing non-stop since before i woke up at 11:30!) and they say another 2 to 4 tonight, 4 to 7 tomorrow, and another inch tomorrow night after that -- absolutely insane, but snow has to be my absolute favorite weather of all time! =)  i woke up today in time to shovel out my car and get to campus for pizza seminar.... was going to turn in my complex final to the prof. in his office but caught him just as he was leaving the building (any later and i woulda had to mail the durn thing to him... blah, so i cut it close!)  after that, scott wanted to go to his bank and i needed to go to mine -- this should be a 30 minute round trip on a normal day, but it took us a full 2 hours plus some to get there and back in the crazy weather and crazier traffic... after that, i caught up with eric for a quick dinner on campus and to go to an orchestra concert he wanted to go to, neither of us considering it would be cancelled in the snow, which of course it was... so that was another 45 minutes in the car, stopped by starbucks on the way home and sat for maybe half an hour, and finished our 40 minute drive back to campus... finally home (after another half an hour drive that normally takes 10 minutes!) and here i stay til tomorrow. =P  yay for snow anyhow =P  tomorrow going to see 42nd street  on  42nd street in manhattan =P... should be fun =)  in the meantime, i've absolutely tired myself out this week -- going to watch whatever my roommate has on the TV with her and finish writing my other 56 out of 100+ christmas cards until i fall asleep... sounds like fun, eh? =P  later

      indeed.  that less than 20 hours of sleep in the last dude, like 138 hours ends now.  complex is done to the extent it's going to get done (23 sheets of paper front and back... dude....) and i'm exhausted.  now all that stands between me and finals is 60 some lie algebras problems, but they don't have a set due date yet, so i have time to put them off til tomorrow =P  yay and good night!  p.s. to anyone who's dealt with me at all this week, thanks a million for your patience =)  you're all super cool!

      i'm losing my mind.  i've slept 19.5 hours of the last like 131.  tonight i'm guessing i'll be up til 4ish again because complex is due tomorrow.  the only thing that's keeping me going is the occasional giant size cup of caffeine i'm giving myself like every 6 hours... venti white chocolate peppermint mocha at 5ish means i'm due for some hot cider again soon.  i think i'm driving the people crazy too.  i feel like my life is out of control this semester, and now that it's all sped up for finals and stuff i've gone a little out of control too.  this is a different topic for either later or when i'm more awake.  on a lighter note, hark the title for this entry... i just got back from dinner with the people and since i had left my complex homework/final at home, i wrote messed up christmas carols about the people while they cooked and/or worked around me (i helped a little with the cooking too, so i wasn't a *total* gimp).  here are the ones i wrote as best as i can remember... enjoy =P  joy to the world, colleen's so cool don't think so? you're a fool! she's oh so smart, and oh so fun! i'm glad that she's my friend i'm glad that she's my friend i'm glad, i'm glad that she's my friend  jingle bells, jingle bells leigh is super cool she sings christmas songs with me and drinks starbucks round the yule jingle bells, jingle bells leigh's my friend, it's true she's super smart and super nice hanging with her's a blast too  hark the herald pizzas sing scott's got a cell phone that rings his soul is black but turning blue he's learning trivia 'bout italian food homework, he can do a lot but about computers he knows naught hark the herald pizzas sing scott's got a cell phone that rings  ...and the all time best one (for now)...  eric the red-nosed grad student had a very shiny coat and if you ever saw it you would even say it glows all of the other grad students wanted some of eric's brains they never let poor eric skip out of any homework games then one windy Jersey eve Sussmann came to say "eric with your brain so big, here's an A for you, and a fig" then how the professors loved him and they shouted out with glee, "eric the red-nosed grad student, you'll soon be a Ph.D.!"  dude... as you laugh away, you can just see my brain cells rotting away from lack of sleep... complex time. later.

      it's amazing how much power a nice mug of hot drink has.  be it mocha, espresso, plain black coffee, cappuccino, cocoa, cider, tea, you name it.  (1) hot drinks are wonderfully yummy cups of happiness... i've never met a hot drink i didn't like, or that i couldn't modify with milk and/or sugar so that i did.  (2) hot drinks are generally so full of sugar and/or caffeine they give you the energy you're lacking just when you need it, and that's great, but even better...  (3) hot drinks are a source of security. i've slept 15 hours of the past 96 (less than 4 hours per night for the last 4 nights), and the next two nights aren't looking much better.  i have so much homework to do before the semester ends that i don't know if it's humanly possible to finish it all if i were able to go without sleep and not be running on caffeine for the week, and my semester ends with a final for a class that i'm pretty sure i have one of the lowest 2 or 3 grades in for the term to date, and it's all a bit overwhelming, but i find it absolutely amazing that i can get home exhausted, having been in class and/or doing homework pretty much for the last 14 hours straight, ready to collapse, but 10 minutes later with a large fresh mug full of hot honey vanilla apple cider, it's all ok, and i'm good to go again.  ah, the power of hot drinks  the end. =)

      15 = cumulative hours of sleep since saturday 24 = number of math problems i've solved between saturday and now (7 complex analysis, 5 real analysis, and 9 algebra) 15 = number of math problems i need to solve in the next 48 hours (10 complex analysis, and 5 algebra)  and yeah.... this about sums it up: lkp 42 42 42: i'm going to spontaneously explode and you're not davrbeagle: but you solved that analysis problem lkp 42 42 42: and then found out i didn't and then resolved it davrbeagle: well, that's good lkp 42 42 42: indeed davrbeagle: so why are you going to spontaneously excplode? lkp 42 42 42: because i have slept a total of 15 hours since saturday davrbeagle: oh davrbeagle: that'd do it lkp 42 42 42: and i have more work to do in the next two days than i've accomplished since saturday mostly working nonstop davrbeagle: that sounds like lots of fun lkp 42 42 42: and that's not counting the class i'm 62 problems behind on lkp 42 42 42: so after friday i still have a ton of junk to do davrbeagle: sounds like you'll at least be kept out of trouble lkp 42 42 42: i'm never in trouble davrbeagle: because you never get caught lkp 42 42 42: but this makes me more prone to caffeine drinking spurts lkp 42 42 42: which makes me crazy and in trouble davrbeagle: ah, true lkp 42 42 42: 2nd worst caffeine high of the year was night before last lkp 42 42 42: the people laughed a lot davrbeagle: at least you still bring amusement wherever you go lkp 42 42 42: i know but that's not always good davrbeagle: why not? lkp 42 42 42: because sometimes that means i'm bringing amusement becauise i'm not in control of myself (i.e. high on caffeine) lkp 42 42 42: and that's not good davrbeagle: oh, ok. I can see how that would be bad lkp 42 42 42: after a caffeine high i remember the previous day only vaguely and have a horrible headache the next day lkp 42 42 42: it's kinda like some people on a hangover after drinking alcohol lkp 42 42 42: i have a caffeine blackout after enough caffeine davrbeagle: wow lkp 42 42 42: yeah davrbeagle: and you keep having that much of it? lkp 42 42 42: the people laugh and wonder why it affects me so drastically lkp 42 42 42: well, i did one of these in septemer and one this week lkp 42 42 42: i just get a starbucks or something... am still working later and like a 20oz coke sounds good lkp 42 42 42: then maybe get something else even later lkp 42 42 42: and all the sudden out of nowhere i'm typing like 160 word per minute and bouncing so that i can't sit still enough to work and telling everyone else they look lethargic lkp 42 42 42: and just completely off the wall lkp 42 42 42: you can pinpoint the 5 minute time period where it kicks in lkp 42 42 42: and i just accelerate from there for awhile until i crash and feel like crap in the AM  kinda makes you wish you were me, eh?  i'm fired. =P

      yeah... victory party of the last entry was relatively short-lived.  after i had explained my solution to several people who all said they were convinced, john and sam found a hole in it, even after they had been convinced awhile...  after much more doodling, i came up with attempt 2, but who knows... sam approves for now, with the coda, "even if there was a subtle mistake, i don't think he'd catch it.  that's about what i'm thinking with my work."  so there it goes.  it's amazing how excited i got over solving that like 1/4 a problem... or at least thinking i did... figuring out something after forever of working on it gives a real sense of accomplishment, and really math   is   beautiful... i guess that's another reason i get so distressed over analysis... it's honestly been like since september since i had a revelation for that class and finished a problem on my own, without help or hints, that required some thought behind it.  other classes are better for that for me, but dude, what a semester it's been... i know there's plenty that's happened in the last few months besides math stuff to make my life just a bit crazy, but still... ok, me and my current take on what i'm doing with my life is a novel and a half, and not one to be written at 3am.  we'll save that for another day =P  good night!

      .... rejoiced indeed because maybe lara's not quite as dumb as she's been convinced she is lately... =P  background: analysis is my worst class... i just have a harder time seeing solutions in there than in other classes... no one else in the class, including the people who generally do quite brilliantly on it, had figured out the last problem on tomorrow's homework, until... just now:  me: hey sam, did you ever get 1  me: i have an idea, and i've convinced leigh, but we want to run it by at least one more person before we write it up sam: no, i never got it. sam: what's up? me: look here: (insert random link) and tell me what you think me: i figured scanning scratch paper is easier than typing integrals and stuff in IM =P sam: definitely sam: john and i think this works! me: awesome! me: i did part of an analysis problem! me: (personal victory of the semester =) ) sam: very nice me: ok, so we have it me: now to write that problem up and then back to algebra and complex... joy me: thanks for looking that over me: ttyl sam: bye  do freakin dah  back to work

      it's SNOW FLURRYING outside!!!! not a ton... just like the occasional bunch of styrafoam-like pieces floating through the air on occasion, but nonetheless... yay!  how am i today?  way excited about the snow, but 2 words: caffeine hangover... it's a shame that when caffeine has the drastic effect on someone like it does on me (see last night's post =P), it doesn't last... it just leaves you the next morning a complete grump with a major headache and lots of people remembering dumb things you said and did that you're a little vague on... oops  but hey, it's SNOWing! that counts for something =)

      Dorothy moves to click her ruby shoes Right in tune with dark side of the moon   Someone, someone could tell me Where I belong  Be calm, be brave, it'll be okay   No more messing around and living underground And new year's resolutions By this time next year I won't be here I turn on MTV, the volume's down Lips move, they say It'll be okay  To tell you the truth, I've said it before Tomorrow I start in a new direction One last time these words from me I'm never saying them again and I shut the light and listen as my watch unwinds  Voices calling from a yellow road To come downstairs and say hello Don't be shy, just say hello  To tell you the truth, I've said it before Tomorrow I start in a new direction I know I've been half-asleep I'm never doing that again  I look straight at what's coming ahead and soon its going to change in a new direction Every night as I'm falling asleep These words repeated in my head...

(23:19:55) me: you're the coolest ever steve klee!

      contemporary social problem of the day: creepy old men who like to whistle  this doesn't sound like your typical contemporary social problem, but in fact it is.  at least 3 times today i've encountered creepy looking older men whistling christmas tunes quite loudly, be it crossing paths in a campus parking lot, sitting at the next table over in starbucks, or well i guess being on campus and in starbucks sums up my day so far, so pretty sure #3 must also have been on campus.  all 3 answer to the decription of late 50s/early 60s, greasy, with long gray hair... none of them were whistling in tune, and all of them were whistling christmas songs... mostly sheer coincidence, but kinda strange all the same... i guess creepy would be if it was the same greasy old not-whistling-in-tune man every time =P  blah  back to math

      joy -- 8 days left of class, and somehow all my work seems to have avalanched on me... the numbers on the countdown in the margin are going down, but slowly... accomplishments of the day?  1 analysis problem, 4.5 algebra problems, and 23 christmas cards written.  man... sad thing is i did the 23 christmas cards in just a small fraction of the time everything else took... patience... that's the word of the week... i don't think i'm gonna have much left in a few days, but i'll try =P  the quote of the week: "i'd rather die of exhaustion than boredom"... true indeed... but it would be nice if the exhaustion was a little more self directed than insanely long homework assignments... maaaan...  ok, no more complaining... sleep time.. stay tuned to watch and see me spontaneously explode and/or go crazy by friday! =P

      greetings one and all... to the big city and back... that's the extremely condensed version of my day.  i got up early and did some much needed straightening up around my room today... then jessica drove up from philly and got here around 10:30... we had just planned to go explore the MET (metropolitan museum of art) for the day, but apparently it was quite the day for crazy and/or talkative strangers as well...   stranger story #1: so as we're buying tickets for the NJ transit train to NY, the 11am train pulls up and leaves and we have to wait half an hour for the next one... so we find a spot in the waiting area where it's warm and a guy comes up and hands us fliers and asks "if you were to die today, are you 100% sure where you'd spend eternity?"  i tell him yes, and he asks me how, and when i said because i believe Jesus died for my sins and i have a relationship with him, he still continued to chat for 15 minutes making sure i really really know that i'm saved... gave me fliers for rutgers campus christian groups and then went on to ask the same of other people.  that's stranger #1... not crazy, just unexpected.  stranger story #2: so after the better part of an hour on the train, jessica and i get to penn station, and we've both been talking about how hungry we are for a bit so we found a soup and sandwich place in penn station to get a quick lunch... we got the last table in the place, and right next to us is a tiny old bag lady, who had finished her lunch, and was sleeping and snapping awake and asking questions about our food at intervals... i felt bad b/c i couldn't really hear her, but jessica could... maybe this is mean, but she reminded me a little of a furby... anyhow, eventually one of the restaurant workers told her she couldn't sleep at a table, she had to leave it for customers and chased her out... i felt bad for her, but i didn't understand her while she was there either (i think i'm slowly going hard of hearing, either that or i'm getting really bad at being able to filter out one input when there's a lot of background noise)... anyhow, that's direct stranger encounter #2 and the day's barely begun.  so, post lunchtime, jess and i meander through the NY subway system to get up to museum mile and into the met... checked out some of the asian art, a lot of european (mostly italian and dutch) paintings, some greek sculptures, a spiffy, photorealism exhibit, the modern art section, and back to some renaissance stuff... after a quick trip through the bookstore (i got a 1/3 original price book on budapest and vienna and how and why their architecture evolved as it did over time... it was fun to flip through, find pictures and go "i was there!" "i was there!", and it was only $5.) =), we headed back downtown towards penn station to get on home  stranger encounter #3: so we get on the lexington ave. line and as we do there's yelling 10 feet down the car we're in... some very unhappy crazy guy cussing out everyone near him... we listened to him for 44 blocks worth of subway, and even as we got out he was yelling who knows what at people for leaving the car!  *he* was the kind of crazy that makes you feel unsafe to be anywhere near him... unfortunate  stranger encounter #4: back at penn station, jessica and i catch the train back to new brunswick (station nearest me) and at newark (2nd stop from NYC back down into jersey), 4 people got on and sat in the seats in front of us... when we got off in NB, so did they,... when we headed for the garage i had parked in earlier, so did they... they were only a dozen spaces away from my car, and for the first 5-10 minutes of driving they were directly by us... just ironic that it was like we were all mirroring one another for an hour... probably think more of it just because of out-of-the-ordinary people encounters all day long...  so that's the end of my stranger stories... so jessica and i enjoyed the MET, made it back just fine, went to chili's for dinner, came back to my place and looked at my pictures from the last two months, and now she's gone home.  amanda's car's in the lot here, but her away message says gone for the night... i think her parents were up for the day, i guess she went with them... go figure... anyhow, it was a quality day, and now i have the place to myself and should either get some sleep and get to work before church in the AM, or should get to work now.  oh!  here's the other random thought of the day... so i've had a headache last night and since i woke up today... this is the 2nd 2-day headache i've had since i got back to jersey (just 2 weeks ago)... is that bad?  anyhow, either way, that's it... night.

      so, if you keep up with the right margin of this page, you'll notice the top book got taken off my reading list and a new one just added...  took advantage of my self-imposed friday night at home to finish the book i've been reading for the last week: brennan manning's  the ragamuffin gospel ... seems appropriate to put a brief summary.  from the start, the book is all about "this is a book for ragamuffins... not for people who feel they have their whole life together and figured out"... throughout the main theme is: God's love for everyone is indescribably HUGE... and if you think you have a clear conception of it, that's when you realize just how faulty your measurement of it is... mostly it re-emphasized to me God's love is not a factor of my feelings (thank goodness) or of how good or bad or whatever i am... God's love is huger than huge and constant and always there, even in the void of where you feel nothing.    a paragraph i really liked "it is the ragamuffin who rightly comprehends... she often experiences the "null" -- the felt absence of God.... she lives in the void but knows that the void is completely saturated with love"  that just hit me square on where i'm at right now, and it was good to be reminded that sometimes the "voids" are just as much a valid part of life as the highs and lows.  anyhow, end of book review. =)  i'm glad i read it -- kinda interesting that i randomly started it, read a chapter a day, and get to the conclusion on a day i really really needed to hear it.  next book on the list?   candide ... political satire... colleen and scott both read it on the road trip a couple weeks ago and laughed the whole way through... if i find it even half as funny, it'll be great.  tomorrow jessica comes... we're going to the MET... i'm excited. =)  now really, night =)

      maybe this isn't a "how to" per se, but being a bum is exactly what i've done this afternoon.  had class from 9:50 til 2:30 today, ran errands, then came home...  i've been in a really weird mood all week... some days (like sunday) it's been pretty pronounced, other days i've busied myself with other stuff, laughed a lot, and it's just been vaguely running in the background...  anyhow, i got home like 3:30/3:45ish and found out from colleen what the plans were for where and when for no math night... curled up with a book for a little, then when i checked the computer again, eric was back from his afternoon class and online.. after comparing notes on some astronomy stuff, i threw out the question "am i a horribly antisocial person if i skip a no math night?"  his response was "what?  why?"... i said by the time the conversation was done that maybe i'd be there, maybe not... all i can put words to it is i felt very not happy at all, but have no idea why i'm so unhappy...  anyhow, having finished chatting w/ eric i curled up in my bed, just to be a bum, but ended up falling asleep until 5:50 (we were all supposed to be at jared's for dinner at 6)... i was waaay to comfortable to move, but also had a headache, so in no time i had dozed off again and next i saw it was 6:45... figuring i'd already missed dinner and seeing as i was still warm and comfortable, i went back to sleep again, and finally when i woke up at 7:30 i decided it was time to get up and move... at the very least i needed something small to eat since all i'd had today was 2 pieces of pizza at pizza seminar this afternoon.  anyhow, i was totally feeling like a bum, and not wanting to deal with people tonight, but i'm actualy kinda glad now that i stayed in... when i went to fix myself some soup an hour ago, amanda was baking cookies... i started to take it back to my room to be out of the way, but she insisted and cleared off a spot at the table for me and we chatted and watched part of an old movie on TV for a bit, and when they were ready we ate her cookies, straight from the oven (yay warm cookies and milk!)  now ron's over and they're going to late dinner and a movie, and i'm still bumming around here  i don't know where my attitude's from lately, i don't know why i'm so frustrated with myself and with people in general, i don't know what's making me unhappy, but at the very least, looking for silver linings to the cloud, it bought me a tiny bit of unexpected quality roommate time, and that's a good thing.  anyhow, now, to go back to sleep?  to actually do some homework?  to read?  to bum around in front of the tv?  who knows... but probably not option 2 =P  night

      lara's top story of the day:  best told copied and pasted from an email i wrote earlier... enjoy  "so kristin (aka rooooooommate) just got back late last night from 2 weeks in mexico for her j-term... while there in mexico city she randomly meets this couple whose last name she recognizes... the conversation went something like this:  kristin: "brondos... you're not liz's parents are you?" david (brondos): "yes... you know her?  how?" kristin: "yeah from valpo" david: "how'd you meet her?" kristin: "well, it's a funny story actually... my old roommate goes to the same church in memphis as your parents... she was gone liz's first semester but told me to look out for her since i could speak spanish too and just because she's a brondos..." david: (interrupting) "you're lara's roommate?!?!?!" kristin: "well, yeah" david: "she went to hungary, and (blah blah blah)"  apparently these people in mexico who i've never met have an hour's worth of lara stories to tell at the mention of my name... how most hilarious is that?"  duuuuuuude... the end

      not the best subject line, but it's to the point... when i took psych 101 last year for an elective that was one of the theories of where dreams come from that we learned about... now, check out what i just woke up from dreaming, and if that doesn't just illustrate it perfectly, then i don't know what does.  so i'm somewhere with some people i don't know... i remember having left aunt priscilla's house (pittsburgh) telling her we (don't know who i was with at the time) earlier and telling her we'd be back fine at some point that night  so we go downtown somewhere (definitely not pittsburgh) and to this old warehouse type place where the people i'm with (who apparently i know from somewhere) are part of an organization that runs this crazy place... it's like a 2 story crawl-through maze lit up with blacklights and stuff, really kinda cool and they're showing me around before it gets busy for opening hours... we make it halfway through (certain that when i started out the place was inside), realize it's later than we thought and crawl out of the maze where we're at (and suddenly there's no roof to the place and it's daylight outside)...  so we go back to the entrance because the people i'm with have to work and who's first in line but michelle collins and some kid she's watching (michelle would be in minneapolis; the kid she was watching she called daniel and when i looked at him, it was a younger version of a troublemaking kid i used to have in daycare in memphis)... we chat for a bit, comment that we're both surprised that i'm still in minneapolis (wasn't i in pittsburgh when this started?), look out the top of the roofless building and see clouds doing crazy things and are concerned how long the weather will hold, then the kid can't wait anymore and wants to go play, so michelle rushes off with him and we agree to meet up front...  the sky almost instantly turns black and i run into the ticket area of the entrance, the only part of the building with a roof, but people look at me like i'm crazy... certain we had walked over earlier, i don't give a second thought to the fact that my car is sitting in the entrance area, scott and colleen are there waiting to go (road trip!) and so is mason (budapest semesters friend) and some of his columbia south carolina buddies (they didn't really have faces... i've never visited mason in SC)...   despite the fact that it's warm and going to rain, apparently there's ice to scrape off my car, and so while like 10 people are packed in it, singing along with the radio and bouncing around, i have the scraper out and am attacking the windows with a vengeance (last night it was cold and icy and i had to scrape off my car a few times, with people with me)... as i round the last corner of the car, one of the people (one i know, but won't say who b/c it disturbed me that i attributed this to this person) had been trying to start the car for me, but they had been listening to my radio so long without actually starting the engine that the battery was run down and this person couldn't get it to start... so this person immediately pulls a gun out of their pocket and is like "dude, i'll be back, i know the easy way to get what we need to get this thing going again" and hands another gun to another of the people there... so it's a quasi hostage situation... i make myself busy again with scraping windows (not sure if i'm in pittsburgh? minneapolis?  columbia?  all at the same time?) from ice, in the rain, concerned that if i go out front to catch up w/ michelle again that i'll get shot or have to bring someone with a gun with me -- i don't like that.  i get restless, and am mad that my road trip is stranded wherever we are so i try to start the car myself , and it starts right up for me... gotta figure out who belongs in my car and who doesn't for the rest of the trip... want to just jet outta there but remember that i need to wait for my friend with the gun, regardless of the fact that they have a gun... so we have like 10 people milling in and about my car  then jared and a friend drive up in a crazy old boat of a car and are like "guys! wait!  we have food for the trip!" and start unloading tons and tons... while they hand us like a life-time supply of tuna, and a huge industrial size tub of goldfish crackers, and some other random odds and ends, scott's trying to arrange the people as well as the food in the car and it's not working  i make sure no one is in the driver's seat b/c that's my job, and try to clear off the windshield, but the wipers have gotten completely shredded by the people and i'm trying to figure out how i can get new ones, still concerned i'm going to miss michelle.  so then i pretty much woke up, mid dream, concerned where i was, having seen people from way too many settings at once, still with a gun aimed in my general direction but more concerned about winshield wipers and where to fit all the people, concerned that trying to fix the problems will make me miss another short visit with michelle.  no wonder i was confused when i woke up... but that's pretty impressive detail to still remember a dream in... it's not often that i actually remember them, so do dah for that... but yeah, go figure, my head is a strange and mixed up place... and if that doesn't prove that at least some dreams are just images in your head firing at random, i don't know what does.

      subject is another eric quote but i might as well have said it 10 times today  top 3:  (1) lie groups... had our second class today... until i learn a bit more about differential manifolds, i'm gonna feel way behind (and am) in that class... homework due thursday... oops  (2) driving marathon (this is what eric said it for)... mondays and wednesdays we have analysis til 4:10... then eric has band rehearsal starting at 4:30... problem, analysis is on busch campus... band rehearsal is on cook/douglas campus... there are rutgers buses that go between the campuses, but (a) busch and cook/douglas are the farthest apart pair of any of the campuses and (b) the math building is on the farthest end of busch away from c/d... the music building is on the farthest end of c/d away from busch (c) eric asked our analysis prof if we could move class up by 10 minutes since the students all agreed and he can't b/c of his schedule and (d) getting out on time and driving like a maniac, (i'm eric's designated driver, this was agreed upon last semester) we got him to nicholas (the music building) with about 30 seconds to spare... this is soon going to become our twice a week entertainment i guess  (3) i need to get a better attitude with my roommate... we don't talk much... i don't think either of us expects the other to, as long as we both clean up after ourselves and pay our halves of the bills... i don't have anything against her, i just don't understand her, but i often get the feeling she thinks i'm a slob or that i'm an idiot... i'm not sure which... living here for another semester always assuming that one of those two is a hidden motive in whatever she's just mentioned is not gonna work... (a) i have no reason other than my gut feeling to suppose that's the case... really, i should just give her the benefit of the doubt and (b) that'll make me into a mental case double checking everything i do to make sure i'm not being a pain to her... dude, maybe i already am one for even taking the time to type out a paragraph like this.  summary: i need to not attribute motives to her that i have no proof are there.  so yeah, homework, driving logistics, and people relations, need to work on all of the above....  in happier news:  (1) i think i actually have an idea what's going on in analysis right now!  (2) it's supposed to snow like a foot in the next 24-36 hours... dude, what a party  (3) people crack me up... quote of the day follows: {sitting in analysis, jared is sitting next to me, and scott's right in front of me} goodman (prof): so let's check an example... we can just pick our favorite compact Hausdorff space... scott: (turns around and whispers) so what's  your  favorite compact Hausdorff space? me: dude, absolutely none {5 second pause} (simultaneously i whisper, scott turns around and whispers): pizza!!! (then in reaction to the impeccable timing, in unison again): dude! jared: (having observed the entire exchange, whispering too): yeah, my favorite compact Hausdorff space is the surface of a pizza, crust included  then it was really hard to not laugh out loud and look like we were all being good, but i think we succeeded... dude, i got great math people =P  oh, in futher exciting news, it looks like jessica's coming up to visit this weekend -- that'll be a party, i'm excited. =)  now, to be productive.... duuuuude... later

      dude, what a day  i've been in a weird mood for most all of it... various and sundry reasons, but overall, i think i just woke up in a funk, nothing today really snapped me out of it, and thus i'm still in a funk... perhaps tomorrow i'll be cheerier.  significant events  * this morning at church pastor j announced that when he gets to his 65th birthday (this november) he's retiring... when he finished and his wife talked for a minute, the congregation gave them an ovation... the thing is, he's such a gifted and versatile preacher/pastor that he'll be greatly missed... he's been in the congregation here 27 years... i've just been attending there since september and  i'll  miss him a lot... but like he said, in light of that, we still have 10 months to rejoice together as the next steps for the congregation are taken... it'll be interesting to be sure.... i'm not sure exactly what the words are to my reaction to this, but yeah, the end.  * small confrontation w/ the roommate... it's even on a seemingly silly topic...  we were discussing some bills / other apartment stuff and she throws in "by the way, i get migraines and you light scented candles... can you keep the door shut when you do that?"  a perfectly acceptable complaint, and i plan to respect it... the reason it even makes the blog is, 99% of the time when i have candles lit, my door  is  shut... she complained because last night i left my door open when i went out for an hour; i had just extinguished them when i headed out and my room still smelled like vanilla pecan... fine, fair enough... but why is it ok that she had like 5 scented candles lit in the tv room last night too but my candles aren't ok?  just confused by the double standard because if scented candles are the problem, she shouldn't be lighting them for herself too... oh well.  i don't think i'll ever understand her really, just try to get along.  * worked on analysis for a bit... figured out 1 problem last night, couldn't get the other one on my own, or working with eric in the office, so i called up jared, we went to his place and he explained all.,.. immediately after that we went to colleen's to work on lie groups... i got next to nothing out of that since colleen and leigh have been discussing it all weekend and i've been elsewhere so they were at a different point than me in reading/working, plus the style they were attacking it with wasn't working for me... good for them, just yeah, i left feeling like i had accomplished nothing in the previous 4 hours, and still in a funk  *following me giving up on lie groups for the evening, eric and i argued for at least half an hour about how to read star maps and where in the sky we saw the meteor last night... not heated, just both convinced we were right and the other was confused... it more or less ended with  eric: "and now i could just make a sweeping sexist comment" me: "except it won't apply here, so you won't" eric: "because you don't count as a girl?" me: "that and because i DO have a good sense of direction" etc.  it's all a list of little piddly not-a-big-deal things, but i'm tired, and tired of people for the night.    reading, then sleeping off my attitude... night all.

      above quote courtesy of eric about an hour ago.  so, as evidenced by the last blog, i was tired today and needed some downtime... eric had been hanging with the people and needed some down time... then i decided i needed some caffeine and he was my accomplice... we went to starbucks, but it was quite the popular hangout in the current 10 degree/ -2 windchill weather out there, and we couldn't find seats actually IN the starbucks, so we just headed back for the car, reparked on the roof level of the parking garage, and looked for constellations through the windows/sunroof for the better part of an hour... and listened to billy joel...  aside: billy joel music is the latest phase of the first years in our dept.  i bought the 1st two discs of his greatest hits in december when i visited jessica in philly... the last week around we all listened to them lots, and now that we're back scott got me copies of discs 3 and 4 so that's like all any of us listen to lately... fun indeed.  oh! so dude, we're drinking our starbucks and spotting all the stars we know that we could actually see (mostly all the constellations and major stars that border orion such as gemini, auriga, canis major, canis minor, taurus, the pleaides, lepus, castor, pollux, sirius, capella, etc. etc.)...  can also find saturn really well in the middle of gemini lately... anyhow, out of nowhere this flaming ball of white light falls out of the sky,.... i've seen one falling star before ever and this was bigger and brighter than even the planets you can see... eric said it's either a really big/close meteor (but it was super huge for that according to him) or a really far away bizarre who knows what... go figure... so i guess i saw my first meteor tonight too and it was a big one.  yay for stargazing.  i solved one out of our two analysis problems completely on my own... the other one is tomorrow's job.  i give up on homework for now... amanda's (my roommate here) watching TV with ron (her boyfriend)... not a complaint, just an observation: her voice gets really shrill when he's over... it just goes up in pitch a couple notches as soon as he gets here it seems like and while they're laughing at the TV i can't really concentrate on math theorems i don't totally get so i'm off to other stuff... like  ragamuffin gospel ... that's one quality book.  night all.... for real this time... =P

      dude, so last night was fun... instead of thursday night, friday's the night this semester for no math nights.  chicken parmesan at jared's followed by sheepshead for awhile... it was fun, although i got a little loud and bossy towards the end before i left... not mean bossy, just i need to work on not being carried away/too hyper around my friends here because they're all way too nice and let me get away with it for a bit.  so i left early anyhow because i had to be up super early... the earliest i have to be up any given weekday is 9:50, and that's just a 10 minute drive away to class... today i had to be at church at 9 for an all day spiritual gifts workshop, which was a whole 30 minute drive away... all that adds to up after a fun night, i had to be up and going well over an hour earlier than i normally am on even my earliest mornings... it's been a long day just from that and i'm tired!!!  but yeah, it was good... there were 14 of us around for this workshop... we spent the day going back and forth between large group discussion and video watching and small group discussion (and i finally met the lady in charge of the altar guild team i'm on in my small group -- yay =P)...it was a productive day in self-understanding.  very concise summary... we each have a unique passion/set of spiritual gifts/personality combination, and it's figuring out what those are that will help us each fgure out how we can serve other people with our gifts... for example in talking about what my passion was, the 5-7 most significant events in my life were not events, but people... talking about it in my group and thinking about it more, what i really really enjoy is making people laugh and being able to listen to them/help them however i'm able... so in a way, my "passion" is encouraging or cheering up people.  as far as personality traits, apparently i'm slightly more people oriented than task oriented and slightly more desiring of flexibility than of structure.  the spiritual gifts part was the interesting part... we were supposed to kind of "score ourselves" on various traits of 20+ spiritual gifts referenced in the Bible... my highest score was 15/21, but i had 3 that i had that score for... given no scale is perfect, but part of the system was after we assessed ourselves we were told in the next week to go and ask at least 3 christian friends to fill out a similar evaluation of those same gifts and what aspects of them they see in us... i won't say exactly what i came up with for myself until i hear back from my people, lest they read this before they answer impartially =P  we also talked a lot about other more overarching concepts like how diversity is not division, unity is not conformity, the difference between servility and servanthood, etc.  like i said, it was a good and productive day.  now, i have some more stuff to do on my own, like i said above, some of my friends have some stuff to fill out, and a month from now i have a 45 minute meeting with pastor to discuss the whole process and talk about what i plan to do about it.  should be good stuff... big thoughts to process/organize in the meantime... will also be interested to see how the people who have it respond to the survey.  in other news, since i was gone to old bridge (town where church is) all day, i've not done any homework at all... i only have two classes that have assigned it so far, but they're the two harder ones in my opinion... (1) analysis (which was my worst subject last semester) and (2) lie groups (which started out above my head the first lecture, the book isn't in yet, but i have 12 problems due on thursday!)... everyone else played basketball this afternoon while i was at church, and then got together for homework about the time i got home to rest for a little... they're making tacos and playing cards tonight, but i think i need to make a nice cup of chai, and get busy and to work for a bit.  *hopefully* i'll be brilliant and figure out at least something... if not, at least for analysis, jared promised to be my buddy and explain what i don't understand to me tomorrow afternoon... for lie groups, i'll just have to catch up with leigh, colleen, or maybe even just bug greg on IM if i can't seem to make heads and tails of it... but first i actually have to get to work!  dude...  ok, so that's that... more another time... vislat!

      dude, so today was second day of classes... 3 attended, the 4th one i'll have tomorrow and then it's all a trick of remembering which class to go to where on which days and getting the gears in my brain rolling on math again... joy.  what am i up to this semester?  analysis 2 (this is the class that drove me nuts last semester), algebra 2 (i'm ok with this), lie groups (i took lie algebras last semester... loosely related but from what little i know about lie groups disjoint), and graph theory (bouncing off the wall with excitement about this)... should be good... and hopefully i'll get to be friends with analysis this semester... who knows.  overall, it's good to be back.  i have a lot of fun with the people here and am getting to know a few of them better lately than most of last semester when i was just plain overwhelmed most of the time.  i was thinking tonight when i was coming back from errands, dinner on campus, etc. that i'm just plain lucky... despite how much i complain about workload and stress at times; no matter how much i get frustrated at times, i really am blessed... i mean like i totally get a salary to  learn .  there's requirements and hurdles along the way but time to catch up with life the universe and everything along the way, and pick up on other things i'm curious about.  scott, for example, (one of the other first year math students) is taking a philosophy class this semester... colleen's been active in on-campus christian/catholic fellowship stuff... eric and me have been driving out to the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night and learning constellations.  to be paid to explore the world and stuff i'm interested in is about one of the coolest situations ever to be in, and i really am fortunate to have this job while the opportunity's here.  enough being all flowery/prosaic/whatever.  that's basically the scoop for now;... new classes to attack, feeling good to be back and feel like i have a fresh start of sorts.  saturday should be interesting... the church i go to here has its organization based very much on spiritual gifts and i'm going to a spiritual gifts seminar/workshop there all day this coming saturday... looking forward to it.  saturday after that eric pinky-swore we'd go check out the big planetarium in NYC, perfect since we've been working on learning the constellations... i saw a planetarium show back in memphis over break which is what sparked the idea... actually when he's done practicing horn tonight we're going to go outside with start charts and see how many constellations we can track down since although it's still cold it's not so cold tonight that your nose feels like it's about to fall of within 5 minutes of stepping out the door.  (how's that for a looooong sentence?)  at any rate, that's the scoop,... for real this time =P  stars, analysis, and  ragamuffin gospel , then sleep.  later.

      so, saw "the passion of the christ" today... you can read reviews of it everywhere, i don't need to tell you what it's all about.  i will say this... it's easy to make me sad or mad or scared or whatever... it's not so easy to make me cry.... and i did for a bit of the movie.  when i got to my car to go home, i turned off my radio and had perfect silence for the first time in 6 months.  it totally made me stop in my tracks and just think for awhile.  regardless of whatever else can be said about the direction, the script, etc., etc., etc.  movies that make you just have to freeze and contemplate are few and far between.  the end.

      it's a good day when what i'm up to has no relation on the world, and then i remember what's going on in life.  my friend jenny just got sent back to the states from haiti where she's been a peace corp volunteer for the better part of 2 years.  she was due to come back later this year anyhow, but now we all get updates about the looting, her friends still caught in the chaos there.  what makes me lucky that i live in a relatively safe country?  people complain when bad stuff happens near them, but truth is something really bad is happening somewhere at any given point in time.  you're lucky when you're safe and all your friends are.  mostly i'm just sad for what's going on there right now, having several friends who have good friends there, etc.  mostly i guess i'm just sad for the world.  it's funny how the calendar can play into your emotions.  nicole died exactly 6 months ago this coming friday.  in theory, that shouldn't make my feelings about the situation change any more from one day to another than usual over the past half a year, but somehow anniversaries of events are significant.  kristin (roooommate) is visiting me this weekend, and we were chatting on IM earlier.  she suggested (and i agreed) that since we'll both be in the same place friday, we should call nicole's parents together to let them know we're thinking of them and just chat a little.  it's a good idea and i'll do it, but i'm already bracing myself emotionally.... it will already be an emotional chat, and probably a kinda tough one to get through... it's going to be a weird week.  i'm done being all morose, i'm going to sleep.  night.

      random observation: i can't just eat candy that comes in different colors and/or flavors (e.g. m&ms, skittles, etc.)  like last week i bought myself a thing of starbursts... what's the first thing i do?  open it up, dump out the whole bag and put them in little groups where each group has one of each color in it.  then i put the complete groups back in the bag, and then the groups that have all but one color in another bag, and etc. all the way down to the color i have the most of... then i eat them in reverse of that until at the end i have the same number of every color.  am i on drugs? =P  so as i sit here eating one of each color of my tropical fruit starbursts, ... instead of working so far today i finished the most interesting book i've read in a bit... _things a computer scientist rarely talks about_ by donald knuth. knuth's a lutheran but also one of the most respected computer scientists ever... his idea is, "i definitely am not a theologian and there's not good reason to listen to me... but there are some ways i organize my thoughts that are common to computer scientists in general, and then, maybe, just maybe, my thoughts on the divine and the infinite might have some value to computer scientists trying to wrestle with questions of the meaning of life, etc."  the book was transcripts from a lecture series he gave 5 years ago at MIT.  it started off pretty slow (4/6 lectures) about the process of writing a book he did called "3:16" where he studied in depth chapter 3 verse 16 of every book of the Bible, developing his own translations, and compiling what countless theologians had to say coming from countless religious backgrounds etc.  after all of that, lecture 5 sums up statistically and personally what he learned and how he was affected by his "random sampling" method of studying scripture.  chapter 6 deals with computer science as a whole, completely aside from his 3:16 project, and concepts from that that might help one grapple with concepts of the divine, the infinite, consciousness, and the like.  the book ends with a panel of him and 3 other CS gurus discussing computers and consciousness, etc. for a bit.  i didn't agree with *everything* but a lot of what he had to say did resonate well with me.  it was very thought-provoking, and unique book... i'm glad i checked it out.  eric commented after i bought it that he wants to read it when i'm done.  it'll be interesting to see what he has to say when he's read it too since we come from relatively different backgrounds on religious issues.  mostly i'm fascinated by the ideas put forth.  in the end, the conclusion was... no matter how much technology and science grow, although we can't prove it, there are generally always going to be things we don't know or understand.  the goal isn't to answer all the big questions.  the goal is to keep on asking them and struggling with them.  the end.  anyhow, *now* it's dinner and analysis time... or algebra, depending on how much analysis wants to be my friend today. =P  the (real) end.

      dude, i'm good today.  called the car place yesterday and got an oil change appointment for today... that's done with.  called the family to discuss changing doctors issues, then called and got an eye appointment for tuesday.  these aren't that significant of things to do, until you take into account the fact that i hate calling people i don't know and i have to "rehearse" even asking "hi, i'd like to make an eye exam appointment, when's your earliest opening?" like 2 dozen times before i call.  i'm weird, i know...  but 2 phone calls to businesses in less than 24 hours, i'm proud of me. =)  and hey, maybe tuesday afternoon i'll actually have contacts again.  (footnote: this recent obsession with contacts is 2-fold... (a) i'm getting tired of my glasses, (b) even if i weren't the anti-reflective coating on my lenses right now has scratched off in weird patterns making it so i have a smudge i can't get rid of in front of each eye... i'm annoyed and need new lenses at the very least anyhow... just doing shopkeeping that needs to be done... joy)  that's it.  gotta get some work done.  later.

      today was a good day.  (1) worried about algebra on account of possibly writing up stuff on the board i didn't want to, but he lectured the whole time and didn't ask anyone to present anything -- i like that  (2) later tonight, we had early dinner at jared's house -- quiche... very good!  and it was free b/c we had a prospective student visiting (so the dept. foots the bill!)  turns out the prospecive is a friend of my friend alina (budapest semester friend) who helps plan the nebraska math conference i went to last year and i had actually met her (through alina) there in lincoln a year ago... she was very nice.  (3) after jared's (dinner and playing catchphrase for a bit), eric had a band concert.  the first half was a high school band whose conductor plays clarinet in eric's band.  the second half was his crew.  i heard his 3rd horn parts on several songs between classes and going to jared's, so then it was fun again to put it together with the whole band later... my favorite is a tune called "loch lomond" one of the other bands played last semester, and halfway through the horns come in playing "danny boy" which eric thinks is hilarious.. he actually made a face at me just before they came in with that from across the place.  (4) after all of the above, i took eric back to his dorm to change out of his tux, then we went stargazing... halfway to where we go, we realized we left the battery pack for my telescope on my bookshelf, by the charger, so we had to operate it manually... still, we looked at the moon, then found the NGC1977 nebula again (in orion's sword), then saturn and then jupiter.. jupiter's moons were arranged far differently than we'd ever seen before... usually they're pretty much in a straight line, and this time 3 were and a 4th was way off to the side... go figure.  having gotten frustrated with the imprecision of operating the scope manually, we put it up and used my star chart to find all the constellations we possibly could.  winners are: Gemini, Auriga, Orion, Perseus, Canis Major, Canis Minor, Monoceros, Cassiopeia, Cephus, Ursa Minor (Little Dipper), Ursa Major (Big Dipper), Draco, Bootes, Corona Borealis, Virgo, Leo, Corvus, Crater, Cancer, and Hydra.... and the “winter hexagon” made up of Sirius, Procyon, Pollux, Castor, Capella, Aldebaran, and Rigel.  very cool indeed.  so happiness all around... i was also thrilled to get paid today... i'm tired of my glasses since the antireflective coating is gradually scratching off, so i figured i'd order contacts online... *after* i got past the payment screen on the website i was ordering from, it asked for my eye doctor's name to verify the presciption.  so here i have already processed my info, and they want that... fine... then i get an email later from the website with a scan of a form my eye doctor filled out saying "the last time i prescribed contacts for this patient was in '02" and a followup note from the website saying "your order has been denied."... blah.  my memphis eye doctor retires in april, and the next i'll be there is in july... i guess maybe i need to just visit the walmart optometrist or something and get them to prescribe me some.  we'll see.  reading for a bit... then sleep... getting my car a checkup tomorrow and lots of homework... dude.  night.

      after not watching TV regularly for so long i'm halfway kicking myself for being hooked on 3 shows... but they're fun so i can't get too mad at myself. =P  tired because i stayed up and watched what i had recorded of friends and the apprentice until 2am last night instead of getting even close to 8 hours of sleep... but i *had* to see who got fired!  i'm starting to hope troy wins.  today's another turn in homework day in algebra... i ran the first two times... we'll see if i stay in the room this time or not.  blah.  happy almost weekend at least. =P

      just finished writing up the longest analysis assignment ever... was all excited to watch scrubs, which i thought i recorded last night.  turns out i only recorded 9:55-10:05 instead of 8:55-10:05, so i got the whole last 5 minutes... the moral of the story without the story... oops.  my leg hurts.  i accidentally bumped my telescope (which sits by my closet door) as i was getting out clothes for today, and as i walked away it fell and jammed really hard into the back of my calf... i'm in progress of creating the hugest bruise ever... OUCH =(

      so, walking to class this morning, i caught a glimpse of my reflection in a glass door i was going through.  this is a busy (and thus stressful) week so i wasn't looking (or feeling) too overjoyed,... however, the expression in my eyes was *exactly* the look nicole used to give me when i had just said something *completely* ridiculous.... for that i just *had* to laugh. =)  duuuude.  hard to believe she's already been gone 6 months next week...

      so, despite only solving 1 math problem today (and yes i worked pretty much all afternoon... really), it was a good day.  scott's birthday was yesterday and he had said he was all about seeing the movie "miracle" about the 1980 u.s. hockey team since he was born during their match against ussr.  we agreed to catch a 6:50 showing, and colleen (whose birthday it was today), came too!  it was quality and i rather enjoyed it.  from what i had heard from others they hired actual amateur hockey players for the cast, and during the game they mixed footage of their actors along with actual clips from the televised game... it was quality.  as soon as the movie was done and i had brought colleen and scott back to campus, i called eric to see if he was still up for a csilag buli (star party) since it was extremely clear out tonight... so without actually leaving campus, i just waited a few, and took him with me to my place, grabbed a quick dinner, and then we loaded up my telescope and we were off... saw saturn, jupiter, several of the stars in taurus including aldeberan, a few of the stars of cassiopeia, a double cluster between cassiopeia and perseus, and the M42 nebula all with the telescope... also did some unaided constellation finding and figured out where leo is for the first time.  it was pretty cool... especially the double cluster and the nebula since those were both new.  after we finished with stargazing we brought my telescope back and then i drove eric back to campus.  now, i wish the fun would continue... but  (1) couldn't find a single parking space at my freaking apartment complex... like the whole place is full... had to park down the road a ways and hope i can remember where i left my car in the morning... blah.  i don't pay what i do to live here and then not be able to park even in the vicinity... dude.  (2) the roommate got home while eric and i were stargazing... in fact, we passed her coming in the driveway as we were going out... her current away message reads "outrageous electricity bills make me want to scream and never use the heater again"... have to laugh a little because my mom's comment earlier was "it's winter... no matter what you do to 'save power', unless you just turn everything off, it's going to cost more... i don't know how you seem to have a more realistic expectation of such things than amanda, but apparently you do"... i did nothing but live here and exist, i've tried to help conserve energy, but somehow i have a feeling i'm getting an earful at some point in the next few days... blah.  (3) i can't for the life of me figure out my last graph theory problem... this is frustrating because there's only so many ways i can turn the problem around in my head and i've spent so much time on that assignment this weekend that i haven't even looked at the problems for the other two assignments due this week... oops.  oh well... the stresses of a week full of classes, a spendthrift roommate, and an overcrowded apartment complex continue, but at least i had a good day. =P  night.

      dude, i wish life were like monopoly and you could just buy up the places that charge you money and earn from it.  amanda asked me like a month ago if i could please keep my door shut when i'm not going through it to save power, so although i like my door open, i've been shutting it 99% of the time any more, and keeping the heat down a little lower, etc.  we got our feb utilities bill (gas, electric, whatever) yesterday and i just opened it... it's 150% of the last bill she freaked out about and i've been making an effort to be good!  i am  not  looking forward to her coming home and seeing it... i didn't do it, i've been practicing better power habits for the last month, as per her request, and it still went up.  frankly, i don't think $130 in a month is a bad price to heat the size place we're in, especially when it's as chilly as it's been around here... some small snow in the forecast this week, but hopefully it'll warm up enough soon that we can just turn the heat off and not stress about this.  time to get some work done and brace myself for the inevitable confrontation... joy.

      by now you've read me rambling many times in the past few months complaining how i'm in a funk... scott suggested a week ago that we should have a margarita night since i like those, so last night at no math night we bought $40 worth of jose cuervo, a big thing of triple sec, some lime juice, and some strawberries, and some ice, and made frozen margaritas for all the people.  we made them a bit strong, i had 2, and it was probably a little too much, strength of drink taken into consideration, but they were good.  unfortunately all alcohol does to me is make me tired, so i left around midnight and crashed for 11 hours.  now, it's homework day.  at any rate, me and my attitude probably gets boring after awhile, so funk or not, that's not the main topic today.  brother just got online to cheer me up and sent me 3 pictures that are really cute from around our house in memphis yesterday.  (1) this is a baby squirrel that was in a nest in a tree that got cut down at brother's job on thursday.  they didn't see the baby or the nest til after the tree was done... it's so small it hasn't opened its eyes yet.  rather than leave it die (how's the mother going to find it in a tree that's not there anymore?), ryan's secretly taking care of it in his room when he's home, and keeping it in his shirt pocket while he's in classes at school, and bottle-feeding it.  top secret from parents-- don't tell.       i know it's a a small pic and little blurry, but that's the best focus i could get it... it's sitting in my brother's hand... his wrist it towards you and fingers behind the baby just to give a sense of its tiny size.  (2) the family has 4 baby goats now: these are bob and allie.        (3) and these are mary helen and mark:        that's a party, right?  yay for small animals... the end.

      just kidding.  dude, so i was up later than necessary last night.  one class today and i've spent a whole afternoon since.  after class, eric and me got lunch (at subway... this is why thursday is "subway day"), went to lowe's to try to buy a little metal rod to replace one that goes in the leg of my telescope tripod that we lost, were unsuccessful... drove out to where we go stargazing to search the ground for the missing piece, were still unsuccessful, went by starbucks and went home... talked quite a bit during the whole 3 hour extravaganza:  comment 1: "i think that you have a very different way of interacting with the world and with people than like... everyone"  comment 2: "have you ever been tested for ADD/ADHD?  like not that you have it or whatever, but like you do have some common behaviors with people who actually have it that i know... but then again i wonder, how do we decide that a behavior is wrong and needs changing just because it's different per se?"  i've been jokingly told i have ADD or ADHD before and i'm in denial...  jokingly ... not concerned really, just got me thinking about why it is i act the way i usually do... why i almost always need to be "active" in my interaction with other people and why i get fidgety if there's not enough background noise/colors/interaction going on around me... who knows, maybe i am... but you know what... i don't care =P  ironically enough, i had decided this afternoon would be a "mental health day"... sooo much work and sooo little sleep this week that i need it... reading/lounging, and watching friends and the apprentice later... should be a party... do dah =)  the end.

      dude, hello 3:40am  so i got my wish... when eric finished his homework, he emailed me to see if i wanted to go star looking... it was so clear when i packed up my telescope into the car, with just a fringe of clouds on the southern horizon... half an hour later, when we got to where we usually go to stargaze, the whole sky had clouded over except for a patch around jupiter... not wanting to have made the trip for nothing, we set up quickly and watched until it was covered in clouds too... interesting observation: every other time we've seen jupiter in the last 2 weeks, it had 2 moons on one side of it and 2 on the other... this time there were 3 on one side and 1 on the other.  once there were no stars/planets to watch anymore, we chased a plane (i have a high power reflective scope, so there's a viewfinder that's just to look through to center where the scope is pointed without magnification, then another place to look in where you actually attach different size eyepieces to change magnification with it etc.  eric used the viewfinder to center on the plane and then moved the scope with the plane while i got to look through the magnifier... we did that last time too... conclusion: planes look really funny in telescopes -- it's a fun game.  then, having run out of celestial objects AND planes, there were a herd of deer watching us again from 50 feet down the road, so we centered the scope on them... since the scope is reflective, the light coming into it hits a big parabolic mirror in the back which bounces back to a straight mirror to aim the reflection out through the eyepiece... if you're any good at optics, you know this means that the image you see in the scope is upside down of what you see in real life.  while looking at stars or planets this isn't noticeable since it's enlarging points of light, and how the heck are you supposed to know which way is "up" looking at another planet?  but looking at the deer, upside down, was  hilarious ... (maybe we just have a little too much fun with the telescope, who knows...  we  found it funny at least =P)  having finished watching wildlife too, we tried to model how the phases of the moon work with our shadows and a streetlight, and are puzzled about "new moons", but had a fun time indeed.  so that's my star-less stargazing story of the night.  now, i've written up all i'm going to write up for lie groups... colleen called earlier to compare notes on how i was doing and it turned out at that point in time (5 hours after i left them) i had exactly the same amount of work done and on the ones i asked her about her answers to, i had deduced and proved the same, so maybe working on my own isn't all that bad after all. =P  now to clean up so i can go to sleep... most of you know i can't stand working at desks and would much rather write on a book in my lap, so when at home i generally work sitting on my bed with everything spread out around me... lie groups is so tricky though that i have 8 different reference books spread out everywhere, a stack of scratch paper, a stack of real paper, my notebook, and my lapdesk (one of the greatest inventions ever)... in other words, a big mess.  oh bother.  i'm done rambling for today... really... class in 7-8 hours... if i'm still up and not 100% sure on the quality of my homework, though, why do i win?  because i have no more homework due til tuesday now and no majorly time-consuming plans for the weekend, so i can take a day off tomorrow after i go to lie groups lecture... that's a party... and tomorrow is subway day too!  how party is that?  really, i'm done now. the end.

      dude, so lie groups homework is due tomorrow.  7 problems.... i don't really understand the particulars of what's going on although i have a good idea of the big picture if i can gloss details... that makes so that i know enough that the problems are meaningful and interesting but not enough to be confident my solutions are right, or close enough to right to get by... blah.  i have a problem with group work lately.  if i work on homework with just one other person where we can both mind our own business but ask each other questions on occasion, i'm ok with that.  when there's more than that and we try to collaboratively talk up solutions, i just run out of patience lately.  i don' know why that is.  it happened again tonight.  leigh and colleen were working on lie groups, i joined them and so did minh.  finally, they're talking and talking and i didn't quite follow them so got off on my own tangent thinking... after a bit i figured, i wasn't really collaborating with them or gaining much useful info or insight out of the process so i might as well work at home where i'm comfortable and can listen to music, etc. as i work.  so that's what i did... they're still working together, i'm minding my own business, not confirming my solutions with anyone, but much happier with the system... go figure.  why would i rather be stargazing?  well i'd just about rather be doing anything than homework i don't fully understand, but maybe you read the entry a week and a half ago, maybe not where i commented "stargazing just got a million times cooler... ask me in a week"... so the day eric and me went to the plantarium, i finally bit the bullet and bought myself the $300 telescope i'd been eyeing for a bit.  it's super cool (goto  urlLink www.meade.com click on "ds" and check out the 2130 i believe it is)... it is reflective instead of refractive, and it's computerized... there's two motors that move the scope around and aim it... when you go outside, you find a star you know through it, and tell it where you are (latitude and longitude) and what time and date it is and then you can scroll through menus full of stars, pick what you want to see, and it'll automatically find it for you... you can hook it up to a computer to download info on where like the space stations etc are too... it's completely awesome.  eric and i have taken it out 2 or 3 times since i got it... i saw jupiter's moons and stripes and saturn's rings for the first time -- completely awesome!  i was sooo pumped... why was it a secret for a week?  simple... didn't want a lecture from the parents on spending money while on a relatively low salary while they were here, so it was living at eric's place until yesterday... do dah =)  in short, here i am, half done with an assignment i'm tired of, and i have an awesome telescope sitting across the room on a night that's clear and relatively warm (10-15 F higher than last week) and i'm stuck not stargazing... this is sad.  other completely random observation.... so since i've been living with amanda, i try to acclimate to her habits... like if i toss something she thinks should be recycled, she fishes it back out... so i'm super conscientious of keeping stuff out that can possibly be recycled and actually recycling now... dad tried to throw away a plastic bottle while he and mom were visiting this weekend, and i stopped him and made him recycle too. amanda on the phone just now, "how can you say that?  it's like against the law to not recycle...seriously!  they could fine you for throwing that away!!!" dad in response to me telling him where to put the bottle, "lar, no offense, but i toured the memphis recycling facility before with work... they were taking all the stuff people turned in, and throwing all of it away except for plastic bottles... and only some kinds of those because they were worth less money if they weren't clear.. and even only some of those since they were short staffed to catch every single one that came down the conveyor belt... the thought's nice, but the system doesn't actually do what you think it does... i have no problem throwing this away" duuuuuuuuude... woulda been great to have amanda hear that one.  whatever... it's the thought that counts... recycle the stupid bottles to maintain peace with the roommate, and whatever happens to them, happens.  the end. (was that not the most random digression ever?) =P

            You're  Roots !   by Alex Haley     While almost everyone agrees that you're brilliant, no one knows quite how to categorize you. Some say that you're a person with an amazing family tree. Some say that you're just a darn good storyteller. Others say that you're both and don't much care where to draw the line. What is known is that your people have been through a great number of trials and that you are where you are because of hard work. You have nothing to lose but your chains.

      ...but nevertheless i manage to do both.  boy, did i have a bad attitude or what the end of last week... i managed to stifle it and be good for the weekend and enjoy myself while showing the parents around, but after they were gone yesterday afternoon, the attitude was back, and worse than even before.  woke up today just as grumpy, but really, it's hard not to be at least moderately happy around my math people.    ex. 1: i really didn't like the day we turned in our first algebra assignment this semester and the prof randomly called people to go to the board so i left the classroom for a bit.  today we were turning in assignment 2, and i was really only happy with 3 of my 5 solutions, tired from cerca 3 hours of sleep 3 nights in a row, and not really wanting to deal with putting up stuff on the board i'm not that happy with or dealing with people, so jared told me before class, "dude, i'll gladly turn in your homework for you if you make your escape now, before the prof or any other students get here!"  so, i ran off, and studied analysis in the lobby of the next building over for an hour and a half and went to my next class.  turns out our regular prof had a doctor's appointment and an older grad student lectured instead (who i happened to run into in the hallway while escaping -- oops!)... so yeah, hard to run away from a class setting i didn't want to deal with that didn't actually happen, but i did manage to do so anyhow =P  so jared was nice and sympathetic to my attitude.  after my 2nd class, which i did go to, scott saw me across the parking lot and stopped me before i got to my car to try to make me laugh... later, eric, who's been telling me i need to work on getting over this running away from algebra kick and over my attitude, was helpful anyhow with questions about class/homework, and even showed me some fun stuff he's been downloading all afternoon.  even after my attitude last night studying, colleen and leigh still invited me to work with them and are as friendly as ever.  truly, if you are going to be sullen and have a horrible attitude for a bit, this is a good group to be that way with because it's hard to stay completely down and out for more than like 30 seconds... maybe i'm not bouncing off the walls, but i am much more up than how i woke up feeling.  in summary, yay for my math people.  so about this attitude... dude, i really wish i could get rid of it... like i'm even starting to get a little tired of myself... theory is that when i'm behind on my workload (i.e. the last 2 weeks), then the stress of trying to keep up gets me down, and then that stress carries over in to just about everything else i do until i have such a plethora of negative things going on in my mind that it's impossible to combat it all anymore.  doing homework early -- that's the key. =P  heh... analysis time.  later.

      it's monday afternoon, 15 minutes before analysis class... i dropped my parents off at the train station half an hour ago, and by now they should be boarded to catch their ride to the airport.  it's been a fun weekend, but kinda weird.  (1) i enjoy visiting with my parents, especially mom... but dad has a tendency to ask questions or make outrageous statements and get mad when the answer to a question is "same as i told you an hour ago" or i correct the outrageous statement in question and ask "are you listening to yourself?"  he means well, but he has a tendency to try my patience... on the whole he was mostly good this weekend just forgetful and repetative.  (2) mom has a tendency to see me as a friend (which is a good thing!) but then has a tendency to start telling me things about her and dad, forgetting the "daughter" aspect of things might make it so that there's some things i just don't want to know.  enough said.  (3) i spend so much time with my math people, it was completely bizarre not to see any of them all weekend and hear about adventures later on... i had my own quality adventures with the parents, and i'm not complaining or saying i wish things were different... just commenting it was a different kind of weekend. =P  that basically sums it up... now to pay for having fun all weekend, i have to do homework until i spontaneously combust this week... yuck.  at any rate, analysis class calls... later.

      dude... i am too tired for words.  got up and left by 9:30 this morning to pick up the parents for church (normally i make it outta here just a hair before 10)... church, lunch, checking out every square inch of a bird shop dad spotted on the way too lunch, and driving through all the rutgers campuses later, i gave them a tour of the math building and then we went to barnes and noble for half an hour.  the weiss's had us over for dinner... we got in around 4, visited while she finished dinner, and then proceeded on a 6 course 3.5 hour dinner extravaganza which was fantastic... around 9:15 my parents decided they were tired and it was time to drive the half an hour back to my end of the world... i dropped them off at their hotel, got home for the first time all day at 10pm, was home for 10 minutes and then headed to campus to work on tuesdays algebra homework with the people until nearly 1... now home, exhausted, and i see the parents off tomorrow..  it's been a fun weekend... cool to show them my lifestyle and all my people here, but exhausting running around and not doing my homework (so it'll be an exhausting week in general)... fun to visit with mom despite her intense head cold, and trying my patience to listen to all of dad's fussiness and questions (whose answers he forgets or twists and reasks about later) but on the whole it's been an excellent visit.  back to barnes and noble earlier... i got 2 books... super excited about 1... it's the new top of my reading list...  things a computer scientist rarely talks about  by donald knuth... if you're unfamiliar, knuth is (a) practically the most famous computer scientist ever and (b) a lutheran organist... this book is about what computer intelligence, randomization, etc. tells us about the divine... he wrote a multivolume book called  the art of computer programming  that is basically like the Bible of computer science... so not only is this an interesting topic, it's written by like  the  well respected powerhouse of the field.  i'm excited to read it... he's written another book called "3:16" or something along that line... this is instead the transcript of a series of lectures he gave 5 years ago on the same topic... should be very cool indeed.  at any rate, that's pretty much the scoop.  gotta be up early tomorrow to entertain the parents before i take them to the train station to go home tomorrow... duuude... at any rate, night all

      dude, what a day  so as usual, 2 classes... then instead of pizza seminar, home for a 5 minute lunch, to the bank, the gas station, stuck on the NJ turnpike for awhile, picked up the parents in newark, and now they're here.  this is a bizarre visit... when i go home, i'm entering their turf... they can tell me my schedule is abnormal and blah blah blah... when they visited me at valpo over time, it was very much in the "we're lara's parents and while we're here we're still acting our age, and whatever whatever whatever"... this visit, they're actually stepping into  my  world and having to play along. =)  after i picked them up, we went by a diner for some soup and coffee... then mom took a nap (she's fighting a cold) and dad watched animal planet for 2 hours... at 8, we met 7 of my friends (ben, sam, eric, leigh, colleen, trevor, and scott) for dinner at a thai restaurant...dad's food was spicier than he planned, but it was quality and we had fun... then we all went over to jared's house for coffee, brownies, and sheepshead... i had really crummy cards all night, but it was fun... colleen explained the game to my parents and kept the moderately involved while i had fun just playing... finally, i took them back to their hotel so they could crash and went back for a few more hands.  then, after cards, i drove colleen and eric back to campus, and then eric and i collected our stargazing gear (maps, binoculars, etc.) from his place and went looking for awhile... it was relatively warm (although windier than planned) and stayed relatively clear enough for 40 minutes for us to see a bunch of stuff... very cool.  now, it's freaking 2:45am... i have to meet my parents at their hotel at 8:20 to catch the train to NYC in the AM... should be another fun day.  the end. =)

      so there's this crazy website that asks you six questions (2-5 change depending on what you answer for the previous one) and tells you you're one of 64 countries... i was indecisive on some questions and the results were funny, so i kept backing up and reanswering some to read more descriptions... here's one of my favorites that i earned pretty honestly=P         You're Libya!      It seems that these days, you just say things to get attention. &nbsp;Shock value is the really important thing for you now. &nbsp;You used to have  a cause, and this made you seem like a threat to the established order, but now you  just want to say wacky stuff once in a while. &nbsp;Air travel doesn't really mesh  with your lifestyle, and you'd probably scare the security guards somehow  anyway.

      dude  twice today i've been accused of "looking like" i'm thinking something i'm not  instance 1: sitting in analysis taking notes... prof is lecturing away when he says "and (blah blah blah)... right, lara???" and i kinda nodded, continued taking notes, and a couple people sitting near me turned around to see what had made him single me out for a second... when i kinda shrugged at them, the prof noticed that too and commented "really, i saw you roll your eyes"... dude, whatever... when i'm thinking through something i know i kinda look up and roll my eyes side to side, and i was probably doing that, but i know i was paying close attention and it sounded like he misinterpreted and was accusing me of thinking something he said was awful pedantic or something... i didn't like being singled out.  instance 2: eric and me went to a "how graduate students should handle their taxes" workshop for a bit tonight... we left partway through the Q&A part, and a lady who helped organize the speaker, etc. stopped me on the way out to ask "was this a good speaker?"... when i nodded and said "yeah, he was really helpful... good information", she immediately said "no, really, i want honest feedback... what do you think?!"... like, no, i was totally making up what i had just said?  whatever dude.  so apparently i have the ability to look disinterested or annoyed or like i'm lying when i'm really not... maybe i should work on that =P  now, really, to work, the end.

      dude, today i've earned it... although i should probably be asleep by now instead of working on the laptop and watching nick at nite.  so last night i got about 3 hours of sleep... skipped algebra, but apparently so did half the class and the prof too (he had an older grad student teach instead)... went to graph theory, turned in the results of my allnighter, then eric and me went to get lunch (tuesday is now subway day so we can collect free sub card stickers =P), ran errands, then worked on analysis all afternoon... i actually fell asleep for about half an hour on the comfy couch in the TV room of eric's apartment while he was doing laundry, which i think has helped me stay awake for as much of the day as i have... came home to work and see tonight's new scrubs episode that had michael j. fox in it.  i've taken pride for awhile in saying i don't really watch TV because when i have i've watched some shows so addictively that that's all i'll do for many evenings instead of any work, reading, socializing, whatsoever, but now i have 2 regulars again.  (1) i've been watching friends all year since g-ma pudwell is addicted to it and that gives us at least something to talk about... whenever i tell her i haven't seen an episode yet she always tells me i should watch more tv, so whatever, i'm trying =P  (2) scrubs -- i started watching this sporadically last year at some point, but not regularly... when it was on the same night as friends this fall, i'd record it too and watch them both the next morning, but now, even though it's moved to tuesdays, i've still been watching/recording it....  the writers have such a bizarre sense of humor that it's always a good laugh, but generally with a decent "moral to the insane story" kind of ending every episode too... like tonight involved a really crazy OCD doctor, and a mini-me janitor and a devious plot to steal all the hospital's garbage... completely silly outrageous plot stuff, but the end was all about "half of conquering your own problems is recognizing them... and when you recognize that *everyone* has problems yours don't seem quite so unbearable"  it's quality and i enjoy it. =)  three more thoughts:  (1) apparently i'm more readable than i thought... strange story, enough said  (2) i miss living with friends... kristin and i have talked a few times this week, and i miss seeing her in person... on the other hand my roommate here (amanda) i think is breaking up with her boyfriend or something, she's running around crying a lot and yelling with various people on the phone this week, but we don't talk more than bills... when i ask her how things are going it's always "fine, how are you?"... we coexist, but i don't really know her, even 5 months after living 3 feet away from her door... i dunno, whatever, it's just weird to live with someone majorly stressed out on life without you knowing them well enough to know how to respond, or them knowing you well enough to even feel comfortable letting down the "life is great!" facade even occasionally.  (3) quote of the day adam hughes's away message: "if 3 + 3 = 5 then what's the capital of singapore?" my response: it can be whatever you want it to be since the if clause is false no matter what standard group you're operating in. =P thus, i vote the capital of singapore is "llama pizza party city" (this is now his profile)  dude,  thought 4... i just went to sleep 17 hours ago, and woke up 14 ago... it's time to get a *real* night's sleep vislat

      dude, i went to sleep at 6:30am and you (probably) didn't... and then i woke up at 8:45 with the alarm i forgot to change to later, and then again at 10... today's going to be an interesting day.  on the brighter side, staying up over night allows you to run into people on IM who are either on study abroad or just living in Europe that you normally don't catch... here I am 4am working away, and here they are at 9/10am telling me about their mornings... duuuuude.  the end... i have to go to graph theory or i stayed up most of the night for nothing... then analysis party until we're done or until i crash, whatever comes first... i can't wait (that is in fact sarcasm at its most raw)

      so it's one thing to pull an allnighter or close to it on account of fun... it's another to do so on account of homework you didn't plan to take that long... the thing is, i've had all my graph theory homework solved since this afternoon... for that class though the prof's requiring us to turn in our homework in TeX... it would seem if you know what to do and what you need to write down, this shouldn't be a big deal... try again... TeX is a math typesetting program that is pretty straightforward, but if you haven't used it in awhile (i haven't since early november) you spend a LOT of time looking up commands and if you're really tired (like i am tonight) you make a lot of typeos in the type up and have to go through and keep debugging... this is a PAIN!  about halfway done... prospects for sleep not looking so good...   then again, on the other hand, for "listening" to my gripe of the evening, here's something fun =P... crazy cow story here:  urlLink http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4200577/   enjoy! =P

      hungarian for star party!  dude  so went star finding again for an hour to an hour and a half again tonight... way freezing cold, but way clear, and an incredible night for actually finding stuff.  ask me more about this in a week, but suffice it to say, stargazing just got 100 million times better than before!  the end

      so today was another party... after church, eric and i had been talking about seeing "two gentlemen of verona"... shakespeare play that the rutgers theater department was putting on... this afternoon was the final performance... leigh and scott had been way excited about going too... a week ago, but both backed out because of "too much to do" at the last minute... bother again.  at any rate, eric and me had a great time and are beginning to get frustrated with people ditching plans for fun to do work... it's not like we don't have work to do too... it's just funny because the reason people usually say they can't come is "oh, i didn't work hard enough on such and such day"... at least on the days when we're not doing work, we're not wasting time necessarily... we're having planned fun, and then doing work when we're not having fun... different organization methods or something... i know i'm putting just as much effort into my homework... i'm just also having more scheduled fun along the way. =P  so fun comments on the play? (1) the leading actress is a masters theater student who got her BA from Valpo at least 3 years ago... it was just exciting to see "valparaiso university" in the program notes =P (2) there's a dog in the play that one character is always running around with and making analogies to... so they have this tiny little extremely cute dog that was in the play... he was so good... ran around with a little bandana on... the character who walked around with him would walk him on stage, pick him up, put him on a table, tell him to sit, and he'd just sit there or lie down, and not make an effort to be anywhere except for the spot he was told to be for whole scenes... he (the dog) was even listed in the program credits. =) (3) cute story, and well played out, but since it was in verona it was really bizarre to hear shakespearean english pronounced with italian accents... go figure =P  at any rate, it was a party... now working on graph theory homework... pretty sure i've solved 4 out of 7 problems in the past hour.. i love having a class where i know exactly what's going on, and where the problems make me think but don't make me get utterly confused... this is a party indeed. =P  at any rate, back to work... later =P

      how's that for bad late night alliteration?  so i've been waaay excited about today for forever... it was planetarium day!  i had gone to the planetarium at the pink palace in memphis over break, and when i told eric about the show i saw, he suggested we should check out the one in NYC... so today was the day.  yesterday, scott and liviu had both said they wanted to come, but liviu (due to more work than planned on for today) and scott (due to having his fun last night) both had to back out last minute... so just eric and me ended up going, but we had a blast!  the planetarium in NYC is part of the american museum of natural history.. we spent the morning in the space part of the place and the afternoon checking out animal exhibits... it was really cool.  for the planetarium: (1) it had the best star projector i've ever seen -- completely awesome! (2) most planetariums are a half sphere... this one's a whole sphere with a dome ceiling show like normal in the top half and a shorter, looking down at a bowl shaped floor show in the bottom half... we saw both shows (one about looking for life on other planets, one about "this is the universe - ta da") that the place is running, and then checked out exhibits. (3) party and a half... it was one of the best done, hands on type museums i've been to in forever. =)  so, besides that, i got an awesome orion poster at the gift shop... it has all the major stars (not just shoulders knees and belt... like the sword, bow, etc.) with enlarged magnified views of the nebulas etc. in there... it was an awesome poster... eric got one too actually...  getting the new poster and a walmart frame for it inspired me to finally decorate my walls... i had tried back in september with posters and sticky tack, but the stuff all fell down over night the first night i had it up, and i never did anything with it since but put it under my bed... so tonight here's how it goes.  the wall my windows are on already had a cross on the right hand side of the windows... now the left hand side also has these letters "L" and "A" that my dad found at an antique store and gave me for christmas... the wall to the left of that (where i have a bookcase, my CD tower, and a few other random things stacked) now has my three framed big hungary posters from last fall... my wall behind the desk here (opposite my windows) still has a dry erase board calendar and both my valpo diplomas... and finally, orion's above my bed, and above the bookcase on that side (yes i have two bookcases on opposite walls from each other), i put a string art bird i made 10 years ago, a framed angel picture a friend (jessica in fact!) drew for me for a christmas present a few years back (i collect angels) =) and a framed picture of me, nicole, michelle, heather, and kristin from last year that they all wrote me notes on... i'd been meaning to put all this up for awhile, but having another HUGE thing to put up (orion's 2 ft. by 3 ft.) finally got me going.  party.  the end. =)  good night =P

      i don't know what my problem is lately, but i've been weird...  last weekend, i was in a bad mood, so justifiably, i skipped out on hanging with the people... did various stuff with different ones of them all week, then last night mason came into town, i was done with homework, and knew they were all getting together for dinner and cards and yet opted to stay put just so i didn't have to get cold between my place and my car... wimpy and dumb reason.  today, had fun with the people, had algebra, graph theory, pizza seminar, and now i'm home,... mason came with me to all 3 classes and now he's w/ eric in number theory seminar...   anyhow, last night i skipped out, because i was too lazy to leave.  today, in algebra, we turned in our first homework set -- 5 problems... he started shuffling through papers and randomly calling people up to show their solutions on the board and for some reason i just really didn't want to, so before he called the 2nd person at random, i left like i needed to use the bathroom or get a drink or something, and kinda just stayed in the hall for 15 minutes and waited until he was just about to call someone for the last problem before returning... i can get away with that this once, but i can't make a regular habit of it... oops.  (scott, on the other hand, also skipped out for comparably long to go get a book from the library!  mason commented after class "what just happened in there?  does that room have a seating capacity of one less person than the number of people in class?  that was so bizarre!")  so that's escape #2 in the last 24 hours.  and escape #3 is already planned!  one of the like 5th year students is having a "soiree" tonight... (1) i'm not feeling all that up for mingling where i only know a small percentage of the people, (2) i'm a little scared of the guy throwing the thing, (3) going to be up early... instead i have dinner and a movie plans with leigh later, but yeah, dude... i'm being antisocial lately...   bother...

      dude, so today got off to a slow start... last night scott agreed to go stargazing at like 1:30... i got back home between 2:30 and 3... to sleep between 3:30 and 4... had some crazy dreams and then had to be up at 10 to get ready for class...  my goal for today was to be on time for lie groups and pay attention... succeeded at point 1, and at point 2, but the 2nd part wasn't that hard... dr. woodward's daughter had a fever and he had to go pick her up from daycare, so minh did a presentation he was supposed to give and we left after 30-40 minutes... dude... on the other hand, i finally got the textbook for the class... i think i'm the first person to have it... there were literally no more copies in the states, so i had to have it shipped from germany.  so dude, got back home, groaned at the thought of homework, but two spiffy things to make my day:  (1) got a thank you from jessica for the birthday present i gave her last weekend... quote: "it's cute, clever, and fun (could i be talking about you, too?)" =)  made me smile. =)  (2) got an unexpected long email from a friend who i've more or less been in touch with, but we've kinda been gradually drifting apart for the past year and a half to two years... it wasn't even a "hi, how are you? here's the gloss on what's going on in my life" note... it was a long, "hi, how are you?  i'm sorry that i've let other things get in the way of us being as close as we were... i can't make up for lost time, but i want to work harder at really being in touch" very detailed kind of thing... quote: "I am so thankful to Him [God] for you and that you are true to yourself. Whether you know it or not, God has used you tremendously in my life to show me countless things, and I am so so so thankful for you."...made me cry a little, but like good tears if that even makes sense... yeah,...it was good.  so yeah,... major yay for friends... =)... the end.

      dude, so i mostly keep typing these because i don't ever remember having this many vivid dreams in this short a time period... wonder why exactly that is...  so i woke up from this partway through the night and am a little hazier on details...  ~~~~~~~~~~~  so i'm in class w/ the usual math crew... later we're all working (but none of this is in hill center, our real math building... it's in a newer place) and i go to find one person in particular (who will remain nameless) only to find them and another person (not a math person, but the roommate of one of my other math friends) falling asleep in the first person's office... the place has heaters like my apartment... small electric boxes near the floorboard, which are running full blast... there's a newspaper spread out on the floor between them with a news story that was really weird, but i can't remember it anymore... it was like the talk of the day... i only see the 2nd person from the back, but the newspaper's getting wet... it looks like they're crying on it.. i tink nothing of it, but look closer at the paper and it's starting to smoke... eventually i figure out that the combination of the paper on the floor, close to the heater, and the tears, for some reason are about to light it on fire... i comment to the people, they're like "yeah whatever, we'll take care of it", and then i leave.  ...do other random stuff... i go outside to move my car for no good reason whatsoever... i moved it from like the hill center parking lot here on the rutgers campus to the back "U" of the parking area at immanuel (mom's school in memphis)... go back inside  later, i'm in a room with lots of small children, and many of my same friends as usual (leigh, scott, colleen, eric, etc.), and one of the immanuel preschool teachers working on who knows what, when we somehow realize the building's on fire, and the cause was the burning paper in the office i had been in before... no clue how we knew this, we just did... apparently the fire's out of control... i immediately know whose fault it is, and am about to comment to them but they've suddenly disappeared... i try to open windows, but none of them open except the last one i try... immediately everyone starts helping the small children out the window and down out of the balcony that happens to be there, and down to safety... i insist on gathering peoples important belongings thinking "i'll be fine, people would rather have this stuff than have to replace it with insurance" and it turns into loads and loads of stuff... one or two of my math friends try to convince me to leave too, for my own safety, but i keep looking for stuff to save for people... i give leigh my car keys and tell her to start it up... but go back to work gathering stuff... the person who lit the fire re-appears and tries to convince me to leave, but seeing as it won't work finally helps me get things out of the room... suddenly it morphs into my room at my parents' house in memphis, and not wanting to lose antiques belonging to great-grandparents or have to replace all my clothes with fire insurance money i start gathering things and piling them near the windows... strangely enough this version of my room has a large window over where the head of my bed is (really there's just a wall there between my room and the attic)... this window in my dream has a balcony and then a sloping enough roof below the balcony that one can easily jump down to the ground w/o getting hurt and climb back up again.  i keep throwing stuff out the window and the person who started the fire keeps taking trips with the stuff down to my car... i insist on still rescuing stuff, and it starts getting later in the day... my walls feel warm from the rooms on the other side burning... i see flames licking up the roof outside, but think "it's not in here yet" and keep gathering stuff... notice that the person who had been helping me outside is getting slower and slower between trips... notice it's getting darker and try the lightswitch... it doesn't work anymore... turn around for one last trip thinking i probably really should get out of the burning house and then the room goes black (burning debris crashing into the windows and blocking out what light there is)... i see a small pinprick of light appear and then get hit in the head by something and it all goes black again (unconscious?) ... and then i woke up really suddently...  ~~~~~~~~~~  i mostly type this while i can remember it... i really don't often remember dreams but this was pretty vivid and scary, as was the hostage situation in the last dream i typed up, about a week ago... i've had several other less vivid dreams, mostly involving bad things (like one of my uncles flying to colorado and catching some bizarre illness once he got there and no one could get to him to help) and occasionally just pretty standard not overly exciting (sitting down and having a chat with various people)... but i don't remember this long a stretch where i could remember a dream vividly every night... it also again bothers me who i attribute the fire to (although that's much more passive than the guns last time) and that i was so busy worrying about stuff (once most of the people were taken care of) instead of ensuring the safety of myself and the friends helping me...  in conclusion: my dreams are weird... the end.

      so i finally started the next book on my list -- completely hilarious, an easy read and i highly recommend it to any of you --  candide  by voltaire... i've read about half of it, and that in just a little over an hour... not bad at all =P  the premise is if you think we live in the best of all possible worlds and in the end all works out for the best to take place you're sadly mistaken... candide is this rather naive innocent character who thinks the world is a perfect place, or at least the best possible... then he gets kicked out of his house, drafted into the army, beaten within an inch of his life several times, etc., etc., etc... encounters many people with similar plights, and yet now halfway through the tale, bursts out with comments like "i am the best man in the world, and yet i have already killed three men; and of these three, two were priests!"  basically lots of sarcasm at its finest...   goals of the day tomorrow? (1) wake up in time for lie groups (2) actually pay attention in lie groups (3) write up algebra (4) read the second half of  candide   the end =P

      dude, i completely have lost my concentration and the semester's barely started... this can't be good.  yesterday after my morning full of classes, leigh called me to see if i wanted to work at starbucks... i, of course, will never turn down the opportunity to work in a place that smells of coffee, especilly if its name is starbucks. =)  so colleen, leigh, and me worked for 2-3 hours, and then we all went home... upon getting home, i putzed around and watched TV for a bit, then talked to my brother for an hour and a half on the phone, then watched TV a bit more, then found other stuff to do... a whole 6 hours later, i started back on my work... until i fell asleep, and that left me with a little over an hour left to do this morning before my class later this afternoon... maaan...  slightly annoyed b/c i want to finish laundry before class too and i have 2 loads of clothes to dry, but someone else has stuff in 3/4 of the dryers in the laundry room i started my stuff in... joy.  it was fun to talk to brother last night... apparently the family has 2 baby goats and 2 baby tortoises born this week... dad has a new boss named bob sushi, which just sounds funny... and brother just makes me laugh.  anyhow, done rambling, off to attack someone's laundry so i can dry mine!  heh heh heh

      so checking my email, jessica sent me a fun link that lets you generate a map of countries you've been to, and states you've been to... for fun, here it is:           urlLink create your own visited country map  or  urlLink create your own visited states map   or  urlLink write about it on the open travel guide

      completely unrelated topics, but 2 thoughts  (1) got a can of the new altoids -- apple sours... they're pretty good... comparable quality to the tangerine sours... better than the citrus ones =)  party  (2) eric and i worked on analysis for like the last 5 hours here at my place... partway through amanda came out of her room and said she had a show she really wanted to watch, so we gladly moved for her and started to work at the kitchen table... what do we hear when she turns on the TV but, "stay tuned for 'my big fat obnoxious fiancee' coming up next!"... eric's expression was pretty hilarious... i'm sure mine was comparable... we quickly decided to hide from the TV in my room to work... but dude, who makes up these shows?  i'm a little frightened of my TV now!  the end... good night!

      IM i just sent for starters: lkp 42 42 42: i got home from the diner w/ you guys, then like the coffee had started to set in and i was going a mile and minute, sure i wouldn't fall asleep for a bit lkp 42 42 42: eric said i dramatically slowed down to normal human speed by the time we got to 2am and that i should never have 4 vodkas and a coffee again lkp 42 42 42: we found lots of stars -- i even saw 3 moons of jupiter w/ the binoculars!  so yeah, stargazing from like 1 to 2am... found a ton of stuff, got freezing cold, had a herd of like 10 huge wild deer within 50 feet of us staring us down the whole time (how cool is that?!?!!?), talked about what we're afraid of... found lots more stars.  now, hopefully the coffee's made it enough of the way through my system for me to actually fall asleep... class in 9 hours... surely i can sleep for at least 90% of that time... i hope =P  visontlatasra!

      Q: what do you get when you have 4 vodka drinks and a coffee in one evening? A: me, right now =P  really, i'm fine.  today, being sunday, i was up early for church, however i woke up an hour before my alarm... lucky for me, since being up then allowed me to catch steve klee for the 20 minutes he was on IM from budapest  went to church, was good to be there... pastor preached a good sermon on changing negatives/excuses into positives (e.g. like jeremiah... don't tell God you're too (fill in the blank) to do something when He has the power to equip anyone he chooses to do what He wants.)  after church, mrs. weiss insisted that me and my parents are coming over for dinner in 2 weeks when they're in town to visit... i don't think i've written about the weiss's on here before...  so the first week i went to the church i go to here, this lady handed me her phone number and a note "i'm from the south too [first time visitors are introduced at the start of each service]... call me if you ever want a good home-made dinner"... anyhow, since then this lady (mrs. weiss) and her family have practically adopted me... they have me over for dinner like once a month, send me home with lots of leftovers each time, give me presents for holidays, etc... they have 3 kids: steve (my age, married to kassandra... more on them in a second, who live closer to my house), scott, and stephanie (scott and steph both live at home still... scott's my brother's age... steph is a HS senior this year)  anyhow, steve and kassandra are great... they're my age, and have been married 2 years, and are just fun to be with... they're both friendly in a way that you don't feel like a 3rd wheel when you hang out with them... kassandra's from switzerland too, so the whole europe thing is really cool... she works on sunday morning's though, so steve's one of the first people i see at church every sunday.  anyhow, steve and kassandra were planning to go to applebees to watch the game tonight and insisted i should come with... we ended up going to one only 10 miles away from the PA/NJ border since it was boasting a big party w/ lots of discounted stuff and free prize giveaways... i actually got pretty good at the "will the next play be run or pass?" betting, and won myself 2 free t-shirts and 2 free keychains =)... all alcohol propaganda of various denominations, but free stuff is always fun.  the two drink specials of the night were patriot something or another and panther punch (lemonade, vodka, and some crazy blue stuff)... each of us had 3 or 4 (can't remember) of the panther stuff... cleared out a lot of nachos shrimp and other fun stuff too...  the game was intense... if you didn't watch, with 4 seconds remaining the game was tied... the panthers got the second longest drive in super bowl history (95 yards) and the new record longest completed pass (85 yards) in super bowl history... but it wasn't enough... the patriots got a field goal in the last few seconds and it ended 32-29... unfortunate b/c i really don't like them... (a) they beat TN a couple weeks ago, and (b) they're not southern.  oh well, it was one of the best games i've ever seen, even if the wrong team won.  so i had a 45 minute drive back up to my corner of jersey, and scott had called during the game, so i called back on my drive home... he and colleen were at the diner they hang out at, and he said i should totally stop by... buy the time i was that far i decided i really needed a coffee to counteract the 3/4 vodkas energy-wise (alcohol just makes me feel tired), so i stopped, got a coffee i loaded up with sugar... hung out for 45 minutes while they did homework, and we chatted, and now i'm home...  just convinced eric he wants to go look at stars with me (yay!)... it's not as if i'm falling asleep anytime soon!  later y'all! do freakin dah.

      good morning!  let it be known, today is the first day in over two weeks that i didn't have to set an alarm to tell me when to get up... this is the first night in two weeks that i got enough sleep!... this makes me happy.  what makes me even happier?  look at that to do list in the margin... see the next due date?  monday... that's a whole 5 days away!  this means that while i could start homework tonight, i also have the option of chilling for a little and catching up with my life, which seems to have gotten out of my control lately... i like knowing that i have time to breathe again!  know what's even better?  look at the "exciting upcoming events" list in the margin too!  there's something there again... and it's even better than just having something there... due to crazy schedules, jessica and me haven't gotten to hang out since january... we finally have plans and they're fun ones... we're going to hang out at philly's italian market that saturday, get fun stuff, and make it into a party. =)  i'm excited. =)  as eric keeps saying... just 4.5 more weeks of this torture til summer break... 4.5... i think i can handle that. =)  happy wednesday to all y'all!

      so, just spent 4+ hours working on analysis in the graduate lounge with leigh, colleen, scott, and eric... and before that a couple with leigh and colleen, and inbetween a couple hours just by myself... got 3/4 problems figured out and i'm just writing up crap for the last one...  when it was just leigh, me, and eric, i worked well with leigh and got things done... eric's been stressed and kinda sour all week on account of the talk he's giving friday in number theory seminar... so when scott and colleen showed up to work on the last problem and i got confused i went to the table eric was working at and we started to discuss the problems i had done with leigh that he hadn't done yet... and inbetween instead of paying attention to what everyone else was trying to solve, we goofed off and laughed a lot.  one silly thing we did was we made pros and cons lists of being in grad school... i started to fill out the cons side, and then eric took the sheet and wrote out the pros side for me... his list went like this: eric learning eric cool people intellectual stimulation eric pizza seminar eric couch in the common room career advancement eric new york graph theory eric chuck (our grad director) eric  given, eric's a little (i take that back... a LOT) in a very weird mood this week, but we both laughed our heads off once he gave me back the list.  anyhow, so apparently i have pizza, career advancement, and eric as reasons to be here... forget math tonight though, i'm watching what i recorded of scrubs and going to sleep.  night.

      this morning, between classes i was catching up on emails in the office when sam came in... he just stopped still and stared at me for a minute, and then when i was like "dude, what?", he responded "wow, you type fast... how many words per minute is that???"  i had no idea, but i just researched average typing speeds and found an article analyzing 4000 random people that claims the average person can type around 40WPM (words per minute) and most people just don't have the manual dexterity to "wiggle their fingers" faster than 50WPM... i'm not sure if i agree with that in general, or i just have friends who can type fast from having to type lots of papers in general over the years... either way...  so, then, i went to  www.typingtest.com  to see how fast i could go... first i did a 1 minute test and got 79words per minute raw score, scaled down to 76 when you account for typos i made... then i did a 3 minute test and got 85 wpm raw, 82 with errors... either way that's pretty darn good no matter how you slice it.  so yeah, my fingers go fast i guess.  the end.  if you're bored... take the typing test and leave me a comment how fast you can go for comparison. =P

      forgot about this til just now... anonymous quote:  "the way you serve your personality is like a bad egg souffle... like say you make a souffle but goof up and put in waaay too much onion, and you know it, so you add lots of salt and stuff to make it better... then the darn thing tastes good, and you have a good personality... but instead of just starting over and trying to do it with less onion you just work with that's there... it's a bad souffle man."... (in this really weird analogy apparently onions are being worried and paranoid and salt is being humorous... go figure)... at any rate, i have omelet on the mind now... wonder where i could get a good one (i don't feel like buying a carton of eggs for one decent omelet)  the end.  gave up on homework, i'm going to sleep.

      look at the margin -- the numbers are actually going up!  2/3 of the lie groups final done (no guarantee it's right, but it's the best i understand it)... now just the two hard problems to go.  as much as i complain about stress and/or complete spazz about things, the more i reflect though, the more i realize i am really happy with what i'm doing with my life... two random interchanges in the past 48 hours or so:  (1) amanda (my roommate) was up early this morning doing laundry and stuff and we actually talked for like 10 minutes while i was getting ready... i asked her what she was doing this summer and she commented "wow, i can't believe you're going all those places this summer... i'll just be happy to get a job at hooters or something".  nothing wrong with that -- my sole comment is, i don't think i've ever had a friend who's aspired to work at a hooters before... go figure.  we're just different.  and i'm happy being my non-partying self.  (2) had called home to talk to my brother yesterday and ended up talking to my dad for 20 minutes first... there's currently just an interim director of the memphis botanic garden (where he works) and allie prescott III is more or less running the show for now... the prescotts are rich memphis people -- he's worked for all kinds of recognizable places, she's on the city school board, allie IV graduated from HS with me, and allison (his little sister) graduated with my brother... don't know them well, but recognize them... apparently while discussing garden stuff over a business lunch earlier this week, what their kids were all up to came up, especially when it dawned on them at we all graduated together how we did... apparently allie (the one my age) already owns a business.  dude... i can't imagine owning a business at age 22/23.  my brother commented later "well, obviously his dad gave it to him; that's how it works when your family has money", but however it works... dude.  i may not have lots of money to do everything i want, but being paid to learn, keep a crazy schedule, and explore the world, rather than already be a part of corporate america... yeah, i'm pretty happy with that too.  ok, really, end of thoughts for the night.

      recap of the day: class, other class, pizza seminar, homework with other people in the office for a bit, homework at home, dinner, more homework, went to wind ensemble concert with eric (i actually just typed 'wind ensemble homework' and had to fix it -- what does  that  say???), and now back home to do more homework.  lie groups final status... 3 problems figured out, 2 written up... still working on that for quite some time tonight.  that's basically the summary... here's the quotes to go with the day:  class 1 (algebra): you ask about grades.  my answer is this: i use an oracle, so i have no control, you have no control.. the fate of algebra students is written in the stars. ~dr. vasconcelas  class 2 (graph theory): i'm saying nothing, but at least i'm saying it repeatedly. ~dr. kahn  pizza seminar: (making fun of a theorem that's being explained, pokes me and whispers:)  you  are a special point on a certain holomorphic function. ~ben  homework with other people in the office for a bit:  (1) ian (erasing the board in our office, just after i had finished explaining something):  look, sorry i have to erase your theory of everything me: actually, it was a map of my part of memphis, but same thing.  (2) so let's pretend there's a bunch of dots and accents in our names so that we're hungarian and the minus one doesn't matter. ~mike  homework at home: (in response to my angst-filled away message) may the llamas be with you... p.s. Bob says hi and that he misses you. He's looking forward to when you can kick him again. ~adam hughes  dinner: (i was watching "home improvement" while i ate) wilson: you know, a wise person once said women have to work twice as hard as men to get half as much credit. (1, 2, 3, discuss!)  more homework: jessica: yup, good luck. I've been starting my studying too >:o me: studying is more like...  >:o  me: =) jessica:  :-$  me: i've never quite figured out what that one is me: any hypotheses? jessica: when he was littler he looked like he was studying jessica: you know, confused and nasueated me: lol -- excellent jessica: lips sewn shut! that's got to be it (copy and paste the faces into AIM -- it makes it more fun =P)  went to wind ensemble concert: *la la la* (it's hard to properly quote musical instruments)  ...now more homework =P

      algebra got out early -- yay for last lectures of the year in both that and graph theory today... so eric and me continued the rhythm discussion for a little... eric's comment,   "you know, i just woke up this morning and realized: maybe me trying to teach other people about rhythm is kinda like other people talking to me about religion all my life... i feel the rhythm strongly, but other people, like you, just sometimes completely don't get it... other people have all this faith in religion stuff, and i just don't feel it... it's an interesting parallel."  1, 2, 3, discuss. (as for me, i think this is new discussion topic #1 for july's two-week road trip)

Post the text of the sentence in your blog along with these instructions.   ...and i quote (from December 3, 2003):  "and yeah.... this about sums it up: lkp 42 42 42: i'm going to spontaneously explode and you're not"  (footnote: saw the above instructions in someone else's blog -- out of curiousity looked up what sentence that would be in mine, and then saw the complete appropriateness of it to this week... how much fun is that?)

      seriously, if i didn't make time for a chapter each night before i went to sleep, this week would drive me nuts with all i have to do... last paragraph of tonight's chapter:  "I lay awake thinking of the hell I would give Magnus when he arrive.  Nausea, vertigo, confussion, a bloodshot eye, and now acid sweat, and all for what?  A moment in time, long past, that had no bearing on the present, that served no purpose in his life or mine, and could as little benefit the world in which we lived as a scrapbook of forgotten memories lying in a dusty drawer..., and as I lay there, ... , I remembered how I had walked about that other world with a dreamer's freedom but with a waking man's perception.  Roger had been no faded snapshot in time's album; and even now, in this fourth dimension into which I had stumbled inadvertently but Magnus with intent, he lived and moved, ate and slept, beneath me in his house, enacting his living Now which ran side by side with my immediate Present, and so the two merged.  "Am I my brother's keeper?  Cain's cry of protest suddenly had new meaning for me as I watched the hands of the clock move towards ten past three.  Roger was my keeper, I was his.  There was no past, no present, no future.  Everything living is part of the whole.  We are all bound, one to the other, through time and eternity, and, our senses once opened, as mine had been opened by the drug, to a new understanding of his world and mine, fusion would take place, there would be no separation, there would be no death.... This would be the ultimate meaning of the experiment, surely, that by moving about in time, death was destroyed.  This is what Magnus so far had not understood.  To him, the drug released the complex brew within the brain that serve up the savoured past.  To me, it proved that the past was living still, that we were all participants, all witnesses.  I was Roger, I was Bodrugan, I was Cain: and in being so was more truly myself.  "I felt myself on the brink of some tremendous discovery when I fell asleep."  heh, discovery, i wish -- wouldn't time travel be nice though?  a chance to fix the things you've screwed up, see the people you don't have the chance to see ever again, a chance to make different choices had you known the way things would turn out later on?  no discovery for me, just rambling... on a more "profound" =P note, quote from "13 going on 30"  matt: you can't change the past. jenna: why not?  that's my answer =P

      i'm beginning to think i'll actually survive this semester... what a revelation! =P  now that i've started my lie groups final, it's slow going, but i'm finding, if i just keep at it, it's doable... that's incredibly affirming... 2 problems down, 4 to go... and the last problem is even what i did a talk on on monday, which is also a very good thing!  graph theory's another story, but i'm working on it with sarah (2nd year student) all tomorrow afternoon... so if nothing else, at least we can gripe about it together. =P  2nd to last friends episode ever, then back to work.

      visited yet another apartment today... leigh got detained by the prof. she grades for so it was just colleen and me... it's cheaper than the place leigh and i saw sunday, but (1) the place leigh and i saw sunday had a whole extra attic we could use for rec room, (2) the place leigh and i saw sunday had a separate free washer/dryer for each apartment unit; today's place had one washer/dryer per house (2 apartments in one house, 3 in the other, all sharing) and they were quarter operated... funds going into the landlord's college fund for his 5 year old son... nice idea, but i was still impressed with the space and the *free* washer/dryer in the place from sunday... we'll see how it ends up...   thus, i'm the only one of the 3 of us who's seen every place... we tentatively voted to call townhouses tomorrow and see what our odds of getting in are, and if we can't get straight answers then to fill out to application for the place leigh and i visited sunday... we'll see how this goes...  in other news, we got our lie groups final today... 7 problems, we have to do 6... i want to knock as much as possible out tonight...we'll see how it goes... wish me luck!

      DEFINTION: a best friend is someone who can make your day a million times better by something as simple as calling you up to commisserate about stress for 15 minutes  OBSERVATION:... in follow up to the entry a few weeks ago about having the same enya song on for an hour and a half without noticing, and to yesterday's entry about rhythm... an observation i just emailed to eric: ~~~~~~~~~ just put in my enya CD and remembered my story from last time i had it in...   observation: repetition doesn't register quickly with me...  if finding measures is about finding periodicity, maybe that's another reason why i have a hard time seeing exactly what you're saying about rhythm stuff:  because audio-oriented periodicity/repetition seems to take awhile to register in my head.  end of thought ~~~~~~~~~  RECAP: my day... (as if you should expect anything new besides "i have lots of math to do and little time to sleep") last night i was tired of math so i read for a little (i wish i had time to just sit down and read from where i am (halfway through) to the end of  the house on the strand , but alas i just get a chapter in here and there), and then went to sleep by 11:30pm... woke up early, did laundry and some general cleaning around here... worked a LOT on graph theory and solved ONE problem.,.. (7 more to go... it's gonna be a looong week)... analysis 2:50-4:10, extra graph theory class 4:30-5:50, then went to eric's for a quick dinner before i had to drive him to his band concert... he was off in another world, but we made quality spaghetti with fresh portabellos in the sauce =)...   drove eric to his concert, and colleen eventually came and sat with me... they played some interesting stuff... the strangest piece was called "armies of the omnipresent otserf", where at parts there was no rhythm, but just the conductor cuing in various sound effects one at a time... parts where most of the band members were chanting in made up words... at one part, where it just sounded like them all yelling nonsense, eric explained the score actually said for them all to yell out their full name and phone number... it made for some interesting audio effects... and was pretty cool... another song was kinda a themesong for one of the characters from lord of the rings... my favorite piece though was called sleep... the composer wrote it for her parents who died a few weeks apart, and wanted to put it together with a robert frost poem, but couldn't get permission to use the words in performance... nonetheless it was a really cool piece...  anyhow, end of concert... i think it's end of semester stress all around, but like eric and me argued halfway to the concert and half of the time on the way back... not fighting, but like bickering over retarded things, like the radio dial and who saw what star in the sky on the way to the car, and stuff like that... i think everyone just needs a break... this week is pretty intense all around... which leads into...  PREDICTION: this isn't a prediction per se, but another observation... last semester when we all finished up, people were around for a bit after our finals were done and hung out... now, this semester, our last final is on monday 5/10... people have all changed their flights, etc., so that half of my math people leave town on tuesday 5/11, and the other half on wednesday 5/12.... even the people who were going to be around longer moved flights in the last week... no one's coming back until nearly the start of june... it's like we all just need a break: from math, from stress, from people, etc.  it's interesting... while on one hand, we've all bonded that we'll all be living in a guy math house and a girl math house next year, we've all kinda reached our tension limits in the last bit too... this summer's going to be interesting people-dynamics wise... colleen, scott, and sometimes john, and me will be the only ones still in town... other people will be home for most of the summer, and even those of us near each other have very different plans for what to do with ourselves... just incredibly curious as to how people dynamics will work next fall.  ok, now, back to homework for a bit... joy.  night y'all.

      dude -- i'm so ready for this semester to be done.  one week from now i'll be done with lie groups and graph theory... 2 weeks from now i'll be completely done with the semester, half my NJ friends will have flown to their respective homes for a week or two (or a few months as the case may be), and i'll be packed up and ready to head out to tour the midwest for a few weeks, leaving first thing that wednesday morning... i'm excited for the trip and to see old friends, but it's also hard to believe things wind up so quickly, and change pace so drastically when they're so intense right now.  e.g.: today. i left my place here at 9:30am, running late for algebra... 80 minutes of algebra and 80 minutes of graph theory later, i was tired of taking notes... eric and me went to subway for lunch and talked about classes and stuff for a bit... then 45 minutes after my last class had gotten out, we were back in the math building working on analysis homework with lots of other people... we did that for 4 hours straight, then i worked on writing up my answers neatly while eric practiced his horn... we got a quick dinner in the student center and went to colleen's band concert... then back to eric's for a tiny bit so i could explain some of the assignment to him that he didn't understand yet... now, well after 10pm, i just got back home... am going to watch scrubs, which i recorded while i was out, and then get to work on graph theory.... joy.    and this is typical for the next 2 weeks... yuck  on a more entertaining note... eric is really into music/music theory and since he has a really strongly-defined sense of rhythm, he thinks everyone must... and i insist i have no sense of rhythm whatsoever... i explained how although i understand the concept of what sheet music is supposed to represent, i basically read the notes as tones, and either (a) while playing by myself, play the rhythms how i feel like it (i.e. don't parse quarter/eighth/half notes, etc. and play what i want) or (b) absorb how the piece is "supposed to sound" together with other instruments and just remember the sound and play based on that... prime example... when i used to play flute/piano duets at church w/ my mom, i'd never play from the music that just had the flute notes -- i'd always get a copy made of the piano and flute lines together and time when i played my notes along with when mom was playing her melodies -- i've NEVER learned to count out rhythms that have anything shorter than a quarter note in them and sometimes not even then!.. for someone with a highly musical mom, and who played flute for years, this is kinda strange, eh?  but definitely true.  eric was so thrown for a loop by that that we spent the time driving to colleen's concert and the time there trying to count out rhythms in the music... when he asked me what meter one song was in during colleen's concert and i responded "well, i counted to 19, and decided i really didn't want to go into 20s so i started over again and got to 13 before things changed majorly, so i'd guess it's divisible by 4", he was completely floored!... it's funny, because eric still insists he can teach me rhythm... we shall see...   mostly i argue that even if i can hear a downbeat now and then, measures seem arbitrary to me, and if something's written "in 4", why can't i just move bars on the sheet music around and make it be "3" or "5" or whatever i feel like... kinda like my counting to 19 and not having a problem with it... eric insists there's periodicity in all music in western culture, that that's where the meter comes from, and he's just trying to help me learn to pick up on the rhythm of the world i've been living in for nearly 23 years.... i'm just being honest and am convinced i just parse music differently than he (or most any musically inclined person) does.  anyhow, that's the discussion of the day.  night y'all.

      done with my lie groups talk -- i didn't race and i was coherent -- yay =)  no more public speaking this semester!  on the down side, we'll get our lie groups final on thursday and it'll be due a week from today -- i had planned to work on graph theory like mad all weekend, and now i have two major things to work on all weekend... yuck.  time for lunch/homeworking in the student center... joy.

      dude... in 15 days i will be one happy camper... until then, STRESS.  i'm actually not doing too bad... but like, (1) major graph theory assignment to do in the next week, and i'm not encouraged to start after my record low score on the last one (2) analysis homework due in 3 days... leigh and i worked for quite a bit of the afternoon today and solved absolutely nothing (3) i have to teach part the lie groups lecture tomorrow... mostly i'm set... i figure the things i don't know how to explain on my own i list as "preliminaries" before i start to prove the theorem i'm proving and give page references in our text book for them... that works, right?  it worked last time at least! =P  mostly, i'll just be glad to have a break for a bit!  hitch to the vegas trip... eric and me were way excited to get tickets to see "O" (cirque du soleil)... went to buy them online tonight and saw there are no monday or tuesday shows!  my flight gets into vegas at 8:40pm on a sunday, so we could get tickets to the 10:30 show and be royally screwed if my plane is late, get tickets for wednesday night and delay leaving vegas for 2 days later than we planned on, or not see the show... we were frustrated by all of the above and decided to think about it (moving my plane to earlier on sunday would cost $50 plus the difference between the two fares...)... we shall see.  leigh and i visited another apartment today that was pretty cool (colleen was en route back from boston, and thus didn't come with)... the landlord was really nice... it's the top floor apartment of a two-apartment house... we'd get 3 bedrooms, a common room, a kitchen, a bathroom, AND a whole attic with the floor space of all the other rooms combined to use as an extra rec/party room... basement space besides with our own washer/dryer... the basement was kinda yucky, but mostly because the current tenants were a little sloppy... space wise, the attic was a nice feature... we'd each have to pay $600/month for the place...  we'll see where we end up.  that's pretty much the scoop... back to work for a little. later dudes.

      have i meantioned amanda's gone home for the weekend?  i don't think so... do you know how much i love having the place to myself for a few days?   answer: a LOT!  not that we don't do fine when we're both here... but like, e.g. right now i'm making sweet tea, jello, and cookies in the kitchen, stereo blasting a CD full of memphis songs in my room, loud enough i'm sure you can hear it well outside, all the windows and doors wide open and a peach-scented candle lit -- i can't do all that at once when she's here =P  yay.  back to work, really this time. =P

      i've been productive today -- woke up at 8 ready to go even though the alarm wasn't set to go off til 10  putzed around and did some minor baking and washed dishes... balanced checkbook and other such fun...  had an appointment for an oil change at 11... went to that... i like the goodyear here... the guys at the memphis one are nice enough but always seem to find something worth a few hundred dollars of work that "needs to be fixed asap"... my parents still go there... i do when i'm in town, but the guys at the jersey location i've been going to are (1) nicer, (2) give me an update on my car so i know they check it, but don't make up stuff to fix (3) take appointments so they're faster... i don't mind sitting around and reading for half an hour while they work if they're not pushy and don't talk to me like i'm ignorant of all things automobile-related... i'm not a mechanic, but i know my way around any engine.  went grocery shopping and had sushi for lunch... it was a party =) jenny sent me stuff to make my own which i think will be a fun finals week project for me... so far scott and ben are interested in sharing in the fun... we'll see how this works!  in the meantime i *have* to get going on my stupid lie groups presentation... i basically understand the dynamics of the theorem i have to prove, but need to look up a lot of stuff and come up with an example of how it works... lots of work, but i have absolutely no motivation when it's this nice outside!  wish me luck.  later.

      when i woke up this morning i was sooo tired from not sleeping well and sooo sore from playing so hard last night... oops... algebra and graph theory survived later, it was pizza seminar time, and then happy weekend!  eric's in boston for a conference; colleen's in boston visiting a friend; jared, sam, john, and scott went to philly for the night for a concert; so leigh and i had agreed it was mooovie night.  i wanted to see "the prince and me" and leigh wanted to see "ella enchanted" but we each vetoed the others suggestion... we went to a bookstore for 20 minutes then ended up going to catch a 3:30 matinee of "13 going on 30", which was really cute... afterwards went by starbucks (they have 3 new frappuccino flavors!  i tried strawberry =)  ) and then went home to crash  called home and asked for the brother but mom informed me (1) brother is stranded in kentucky somewhere with some of his scout friends (2) ruthie, the family's pet goat died this morning... she was dad's favorite... apparently he spent several hours with her last night since she wasn't doing well and she died overnight (3) lots of other memphis gossip...   after that chat i was more awake and ben was online and bored... we started discussing the latest mooovies, and he asked what i was interested in seeing... i told him there was one chick flick i was most excited about but wouldn't drag him, and listed several other possibilities... however he insisted that having an older sister, a movie-loving mom, and a string of movie-loving ex-girlfriends, he had no shame in seeing a chick flick, and after reading the yahoo movies summary of the plot said he was game for "the prince and me"....  soooo, off we went; he came by my apartment and then i drove from there... neither of us had been to that particular theater before, so it was a bit of an adventure... it was in a mall, on the second story, and only accessible from the outside, but there were no signs telling us that... so we parked on the lower level, went inside, followed mall directories and ended up somewhere in the bowels of the behind the scenes of the mall... service hallways and elevators, and a maze of places we weren't supposed to be... *that* was an adventure until we found our way out... eventually we figured it out and saw the mooovie, with 5 minutes to spare... i think poor ben was the only guy in there, but he enjoyed it -- laughed a lot throughout and was impressed with a bunch of it that i was too... like when the prince proposed to julia stiles, he opened the hand holding the ring and a butterfly was there, sitting on the ring.. it was really sweet and ben was actually the one to make a comment of "oh wow!" to me about it.... to summarize -- ignore the critics, while not *the* best movie of all time, it was still extremely quality. =)  anyhow, we got a little wet in the rain after, and upon returning back to my apartment, we got even more wet in the rain and he walked me to my door before heading away...   all in all, a very quality day despite my utter exhaustion  oh yeah, and a footnote: before you even start on me... recall the nice paragraph i had on easter?  having mostly guy friends here is just one of the benefits of being a MATH grad student... and yay for them... =)  if even a fraction of the guys you find me running around with from day to day were interested in me, dude my life would be a freakin soap opera. but that's not how it is, so don't even get going on it. =P  the end. sleep time. night y'all.

      dude, what a day  here i was midafternoon, thinking i was just about done for the evening, but not a chance.  this afternoon colleen, leigh, and i visited another apartment... this one near the undergraduate campus, between some bars and stuff... but the house was nice, and the landlord was awesome... despite the location he says that he's never had a complaint safety wise, and that he lives right down the street... talked about all the things he plans to do this summer to fix it up even nicer, etc... we'd have 1 bathroom, a decent size kitchen, a living room, and 3 bedrooms... no matter where we live i probably get the master bedroom, which i have no problem with.  despite being an in the middle of town almost row-house kinda house, it had a nice decent size green yard... leigh and i visit one more place on sunday... hopefully something will work out soon. (re: the last places, we told the landlady of the house i didn't like so much that we weren't interested, and then never called the other guy back... doht)  went home to make dinner and watch the 3rd to last friends episode ever, then realized i'd never seen the rerun one that was on after it...  then, the people were playing basketball so i went to campus for an hour and a half of that... it was me, colleen, leigh, vicki, scott, and ben, and some other guy who was in a class ben taught this year... we played 4 games of playing up to 15 points and they were all pretty neck-and-neck throughout... i pulled a muscle or something in my leg partway through the 2nd game, and while i was moving i was ok, but occasionally could really feel it again, so i played a lot different the first half (in people's faces) than the second half (sticking near the basket and nailing shots)... an hour and a half later, we were kicked out on account of the gym closing, but we all had a lot of fun.... now that i sit still though, i can really feel it in the leg i screwed up -- oops.  one cold shower, and an episode of scrubs later (how can they put jd and elliot back together and have the last line be in jd's head "i don't want you!"?.... dude... next week better be good or the scrubs writers are fired!)  at any rate, class in like 9 hours... night.

      i'm productive today.  i actually slept a decent amount last night.  had weird dreams, but not spooky weird like usually lately.  i was having thanksgiving dinner at my aunt priscilla's house (my pittsburgh aunt) only her house was really my 3rd grade classroom back in memphis and my cousins and uncle were not there, but lots of random people, some of who i knew, some of who i didn't were there... mostly i remember talking to my brother and to michael and brian rose (brothers who i know from my church/grade school in memphis.,... michael's a year younger than me, brian's a couple years older... michael and me disagree a lot, and brian and me never understand a word the other is saying in general)  it was just bizarre and that's all there is to it.  my head is a weird place.  only one class today, then came home to make lunch and watched some old fun TV shows -- one episode of family matters and one of step by step each... i think i'd seen both before... they're simple, but fun, and innocent... i miss those shows.  got a huge package today too -- from memphis jenny... her ohio friends have been teaching her to make her own sushi, so she sent me a kit of rice, seaweed, etc. (i have to get the fresh stuff on my own) -- and she sent me a CDR of pictures, some from christmas when we got together, others from around and about where she's been the past year... yay for fun mail =)  and even bigger yay for friends =)  leigh, colleen, and i visit another apartment tonight... fun fun...  that's all for now -- later dudes.

      (1) my roommate make spaghetti sauce and then puts it in our ice trays and freezes it.  this means we don't have ice, but rather tomato paste cubes... i don't put ice in my drinks usually, so this isn't a complaint... but, does anyone else think that's a little weird?  (2) eric disappeared for about 20 minutes of analysis today -- asked him where he went when i was driving him to band today... his response, "oh, i just didn't feel the need to be there so i went for a walk."  i wish i didn't feel the need to stay around in class when i'm tired of it ... oh well  (3) sam said he's getting me a ton of bouncy balls for my birthday -- this makes me happy =)  (4) nothing due til next wednesday and just a presentation between now and then (on monday)... i like this change of pace... working on cleaning out my yahoo email account... i have a couple people who have written me over 100 emails in past 3 months... duuude  (5) watching tv while i work on emails...mystic pizza (old julia roberts movie that's supposed to be bad) is on on before they were stars on bravo... half way watching,... they were in a planetarium just now... yay stars =)  the end.

      i get made fun of a lot for my habits with locking things, keeping things out of view in my car, etc., etc., etc. which i just consider common sense habits (if you park your car somewhere, especially in a public lot, you don't leave anything out with your address showing or anything remotely of value, even just a CD because you don't want to give someone incentive to break in.)  my memphis friends have similar habits, but my non-memphis friends just seem to laugh a lot.  in light of that, thought this was interesting:   http://houseandhome.msn.com/Move/BestandWorstCitiesforCrime.aspx   the fact that i come from the 2nd highest crime-ridden large city in the country and now at the send lowest crime-rate metropolitan area in the country completely cracked me up.  the end.

      i'm not having very good luck with people lately.  situation 1: we're each required to do a presentation for lie groups between now and the end of the semester.  not knowing what the prof plans to cover in the next two weeks, i've been unsure what's fair game.  my email to the prof: Dr. Woodward: I was wondering if you could suggest some appropriate presentation topics.  I'm finding it difficult to choose a topic on my own without knowing what you envision to happen in the next two weeks.  Thanks much! Lara  his response: please do!  reaction: please do what?  pick a topic out of the blue even if it has nothing to do with the sections of the text he wants to cover?  um, riiiight.  situation 2: yesterday we didn't know when any of our finals were.  although rutgers has a schedule of when finals are for classes in general, usually grad classes vote and do theirs whenever they want.  two weeks ago, me, eric, sam, scott, and jared were sitting around at jared's and discussing how we'd all love if our analysis final was on the last day of class rather than during finals week... at the very least we all wanted it as early as possible.  so yesterday jared brought up the subject of finals.  (note: finals week technically goes may 6- may 12)  dr. goodman suggested we have the exam on the 13th or 14th.  leigh quickly reminded him that finals period ends the 12th, so then he suggested the 12th...... in light of the previous discussion with other students and in light of the fact that i'd *like* to get out of town for valpo graduation as early as possible on the 12th, i commented.  me: i might have something going on then.  What about earlier?  goodman's response: you have an OBLIGATION to be here on the 12th.  that's invalid.  does the 10th work for people though?  result: i got barked at in front of the class.   note: what i did happens in every class every semester -- one girl said she didn't like the tentative date for algebra final just now because she "had somewhere to be" on the 7th... everyone i've talked to about it (except 1... see situation 3) said i was making a request, and was fine.... i felt bad though, especially after this morning.  situation 3: i had asked everyone last night who was studying in the graduate lounge, plus a few other people on IM when they'd like algebra final so we could email the prof and get him thinking about when to schedule it.  every single person i talked to said earlier is better and getting it 3 or 4 days before the analysis exam would be good.  i didn't talk to everyone in the class, but definitely a majority before i emailed dr. vasconcelas saying "can we please set a date for our final.  analysis is on monday the 10th, so a few days before that would be good." (loose paraphrase)  ian came into class this morning telling me how i was inappropriate in analysis yesterday and that he really wanted algebra on the 12th just to spite me because i'm imposing my ideas on everyone.  now i'm kinda frustrated... when i spoke up yesterday i didn't say "the exam HAS to be before the 12th", i made a request and did so after realizing a lot of the rest of the class wanted an earlier exam too.... i asked most of the class before i wrote the algebra prof too.  i wasn't trying to be out of line or bullheaded and now i feel crappy about it.  go me.  graph theory time.  later.

      i just realized when i got home just now -- i was gone for over 14 hours!... dude  8-8:30am: woke up, got ready before amanda was up b/c she's not used to me being up til after she's gone on mondays  8:30-9:30am: caught up on emails, organized my stuff for the day  9:30-10:15am: ran by the bank, picked up eric, went to the local playhouse to buy tickets to see "cats" next week  10:15-11am: got omeletes at a local diner =)  i've been craving omeletes for awhile now. =P  11am-11:30am: unsuccessfully worked on algebra homework in the office with mike  11:30am-12:50pm: lie groups... completely lost  12:50-1:30pm: lunch in the student center with leigh -- i had indian food =)  1:30-2:30pm: worked on homework on my own in the office, waited in the parking lot until a spot close to the building showed up to move my car to for the quick post-analysis get-away with eric  2:30pm-2:50pm: had a good chat with jared and played wallball with my new sparkly bouncy ball against the chalkboard in the analysis classroom before anyone else got there =)  2:50pm-4:10pm: analysis -- dr. goodman snapped at me when i told him i'd rather not have the final later than monday may 10 (i plan on getting outta town on the 12th)... that's the current plan now that we all voted  4:10-5pm: drove eric to class and fought traffic to get myself back to campus  5-8pm: worked on algebra homework with leigh to absolutely no avail  8pm-9pm: helped eric make a pizza, had dinner, listened to him vent for a bit (or as he prefers to say "connect with his subconscious" (this is rare... the venting, not the creative rephrasing, so it was interesting)), had a crazy theological discussion with trevor (eric's roommate) who had just returned back from a crazy just for fun trip to paris with his girlfriend (he just skipped classes for a week and a half for fun!)  9-11:45pm: worked more on homework, finished some, decided i didn't care on the rest and chatted with eric more in the grad lounge  11:45pm: finally left to come home and here i am... sooo tired, so much yet to write up tonight... the work never ends!  night y'all.

      eric had me up early this morning... "cats" is showing at the local playhouse end of next week so he was in charge of getting tickets for me, him, scott, and colleen.  however, eric doesn't have a car, so he conned me into picking him up by 10 this morning (i usually *wake up* at 10 on mondays!) to get the tickets... he was ready to go back to campus then, but i told him that i've wanted a good omelete for a month and if we had 75 minutes til class he was darn well getting an omelete with me... went to a local diner, got ourselves omeletes and it was a good morning. =)  i had a mango lassi to drink with my lunch and i can still taste it -- spectacular. =)  it's also eighty-freakin-eight degrees outside today -- *this* is outrageous... especially since it was 50s and rainy all last week and reverts back to that by the end of this week.  oh well.  studying for a bit, then class.  later dudes =P

      leigh and i worked at starbucks awhile today, at the outside patio tables -- such beautiful weather.... tomorrow's high 88!!!  how nuts is that???  i figured out part of an analysis problem that sam's been struggling with, and sam is like analysis genie -- he knows like everything there is to know plus some and is good friends with the prof. who wrote the book (from his undergrad university) -- that was a much needed mathematical confidence booster -- we'll see how long it lasts, but right now i'm still on cloud 9 about that for a bit =)  i got scott to do a seed impression -- he was a flower the other day and it cracked me up... he's refused to repeat that, but him curling up in a ball on the floor and saying "the seed hides under the ground, and then it stretches up, peeks its head up, sees the sun and hides again (acting things out as he says them)... look, see how little i can be?!?!" all in falsetto was hilarious... i was laughing so freakin hard when i left campus earlier  i've made calls and filled in my schedule for next month... i have places to stay may 12-25th... and there's one more person i'd like to talk to and see if their schedule matches up for me to stop by them too for a day, but who knows -- yay for fun upcoming travels!  oh! and on the housing front, colleen, leigh, and i all agreed we liked the townhouse apartment (the one i liked better on friday), rather than house, but that we want to research our chances of getting a townhouse on our own rather than subletting from this other guy before we tell him a definite yes.  we shall see, but at least we're all on the same page =P  dude, it's 9:45pm and i've yet to eat dinner... maybe i should look into that... later dudes! =)

      i've come to the conclusion i'm not capable of sleeping like a normal person anymore  e.g. friday night, i was excited about saturday so i woke up a lot  e.g. last night, exhausted after having fun all day, i set my alarm for 9am this morning, went to bed, took a bit to fall asleep, then woke up with a start at 7 convinced i was late for something or other... got up, started getting ready, realized i had 2 more hours to be able to sleep before my alarm really went off, and went back to bed... 8am same thing happened... only this happens several mornings a week... i'm so weird.  but hey, at least i have lots of fun when i'm actually awake during the day, right? =)  later dudes

      today was super good. =)  (1) woke up early and drove to philly to hang with jessica  (2) we drove down into town and wandered through the italian market for a bit... i got 2 super cool ginger-lime scented candles,... this makes me happy =)  (3) wandered down south street to penn's landing, waved at the boats and at the river  (4) wandered back up south street to the market, and bought books at a used book store, quality pasta and fresh veggies from the market stands, and each got a requisite cup of gelato (i wanna go back to europe... =P)  (5) drove our stuff back to jessica's place, collapsed for a bit, chatted for a bit, then watched "brother bear"  (6) cooked up all our spiffy stuff into one awesome dinner =) (mushroom stuffed pastas (forget the name, but like mini raviolis), spinach fettuccini, marinara sauce, portabello mushrooms, and zuchinni for the main stuff... salad with blue cheese vinagrette besides -- fantastic!)  (7) went out to the theater to see "the ladykillers" which we both enjoyed quite a bit. =)  (8) went back to jessica's and collapsed again for a bit and chatted some more  (9) drove back home and got in around 12:30  now, mass email time and then time for sleep!  later dudes =)

      today was long but good  i didn't sleep enough, but i never do... 2 classes and pizza seminar later, colleen and leigh and i went house-hunting for next year, and after that i've mostly been a putz... more on house-hunting in a sec... first other random comments.  * eric told me a few days ago that he bets that if i had something in my head that i think about a lot or whatever and try to keep it from him, he'd figure out what it is because he thinks he knows me that well.  as a challenge back, i have a crazy code i write notes to myself in that i don't want other people to be able to read.  i wrote him a few sentences in it and he's making it his personal challenge to crack the code.  i really would be willing to bet a few hundred dollars that he can't though... shall be fun  * sam and me played wallball with my new bouncy ball at colleen's house at dinnertime tonight, that was fun =P  *that's about it, except the house-hunting part.  so we visited two places.  i like the first one better so i'll describe it second.  second place: house in highland park, NJ... i.e. about as far from campus as i am now, just going to opposite direction, really nice residential family neighborhood.  we'd have the bottom floor of a house where the top floor belongs to a family with small kids.  it was basically a hallway with 2 bedrooms on one side, a bedroom and a common room on the other side, a kitchen on one end (comparable to the size one i have now, but shaped different), and a bathroom on the other end.  enough space for us all, $600/person/month (i.e. $1800/month total, which is pretty standard lower end price for places in central jersey)  the landlady was really nice, and it was fine.  i didn't like the layout very much (all in a straight line off a narrow hallway) or the fact that the backyard was kinda trampled down to dirt and small.  also, no washer/dryer, so we'd have to go to a laundromat, which i don't like very much... otherwise, it's acceptable and we'd be fine there.  place one: town house in edison, NJ... a little farther from campus, but near the grocery store we usually go to, etc., so not bad either.  the landlord is a guy in his late 20s at most, and he lives there too... it's a 3 story place, he'd have the basement, we'd have the 3rd floor, and we'd share the kitchen/living room.  mostly he wouldn't be around, but it is his place too.  that concerned colleen and leigh a little at first, but after meeting the guy, it's not as much of a problem.  i liked the layout better -- for 1, i like sleeping up high (e.g. i always had the top bunk in dorm rooms, i've always had a 2nd floor bedroom, etc.  i like being on the top floor instead of the bottom)... there are 3 bedrooms and 2 baths on our floor... since i already own a full size bed, i'd get the master bedroom with my own bathroom... there's a half bath on the lower floor and two common rooms instead of just the one (like in the other place)...the kitchen is more open, and bigger than in the other place as well... after living in compass pointe in valpo last spring and in rivercrest now, i also kinda like the green space that comes with being in an apartment community.  we wouldn't have our own yard per se, but there's a lot more common green space to make use of that way.  the price?  $1750/month for all of us together.  i'd probably pay a little more since i'd get my own bathroom/bigger room, but at most be paying $600/month, like i'd be paying regardless at the other place.  we'd have our own washer/dryer in our unit, unlike the complex laundry room i share now, which is also nice.  so yeah, that's the summary.  leigh originally loved the house in highland park better, but the washer/dryer situation is swinging her towards the townhouse -- i loved the townhouse a lot more from the start, and colleen's up in the air all around.  hopefully we'll come to a decision we all like when i get back... where am i going?  philly of course!  leaving as soon as i get myself up and moving tomorrow to hang with jessica for the day -- i'm excited!  and now that all that rambling's done, reading myself to sleep... later dudes =)

      today was a good day.  only one class, no homework due  after that, it was free cookie day at subway.  (no advertising, but if you're a subway regular, like... um, some people, you knew to ask and they give you a free cookie! =P)  colleen and leigh came with besides the usual me and eric subway day crew (free cookies are incentive for anything =P)  the 4 of us got some major grocery shopping done, and at the grocery store i blew 50 cents on getting a bouncy ball out of one of the toy machines on the way out... it's twice as big as a normal bouncy ball and dark green and silver and sparkly -- it's the coolest ever. =)  colleen, leigh, john, and i worked on algebra homework for an hour and a half before giving in to the beautiful weather and quitting... we got one problem done, that's something, right?  went home, got non-sandal shoes and my kickball, and alternated between kicking it around a soccer field and playing on a nearby on-campus ropes course w/ leigh, colleen, and scott... lots of fun, and a beautiful day  developed film, and camped out in the living room to watch the apprentice finale -- dude!  that was fun... i'm such an addict, i know.  then again, after it was announced that bill was the winner, i got phone calls from friends comparing reactions with me, so i'm not alone on that one =P...  i got to see the NYC news after though and see the reactions of kwame's family and an interview with the donald about it all... dude such fun.  immediately after all that, eric and me went and had a csilag buli for the first time in awhile... found saturn before it set, and jupiter and its moons were extremely bright... are learning new constellations since the ones we know set early now that it's not winter anymore  and here it is, nearly 2am, i have class in less than 8 hours, and i'm still up -- go me =P, but that basically summarizes my day =P  night y'all.

(laughing) hey wanna get married at the bellagio? me: so *that*'s what we're doing in july?... dude! eric: just kidding, dude, ok, shows... tickets start at...

      funny how a day can go from realy down to really up and vice versa  today started out good... i was done with graph theory homework by 10 last night, had sat through both my classes this morning, and had subway with eric... so far, an excellent day -- i was having fun, and it was good  then, we went to work on homework with everyone else... one word: analysis.  i started in on the first problem that other people had finished with and asking for a hint got "it's easy, don't think so hard... it's practically trivial"  3 hours later, working on parts of every problem, (the supposedly "easy" parts), i had solved nothing and was ready to punch my fist through a wall or cry or something, so i left and came home without saying a word when i left.  got home, and went to check email since i've been writing people about visiting them on mine and eric's roadtrip in july, and had my first email from ian since december.  i had wondered why he was on IM 24/7 for february/early march and why i hadn't heard from him.  turns out his dad had a stroke in mid february and was in a coma until march 3, when he passed away.  ian has his master's defense later this month and had missed a month of school to be home in michigan for all that, and being so overwhelmed with life this semester, he hadn't written and updated much of anyone because he had enough to do to keep on top of his own life.  anyhow, after reading the epistle he wrote back about everything, i'm kinda bummed for him now too.  nagyon sajnos....  i'm curling up in a ball for a bit... time to re-attack the world again in a few.... hours (would say days, but deadlines interefere... unfortunate)

      so i've been working on graph theory homework for the better part of 2 hours.... had a CD in the whole time.  i just *now* realized that i accidentally hit the "repeat" button and have been listening to the same enya song over and over for the past hour and a half instead of the whole CD...  that's just plain sad that it took 1.5 hours for me to even *notice* the repetition.  what does this say about my head? discuss. =P

      question: why is it that i meet other peoples grandparents and talk for a nice loooong time, and when i call my grandma on the phone, she can't get off the phone with me quick enough?... i just called her to say happy easter and she really didn't want to hear a single thing... it was "oh lara, are you in memphis or new jersey?... oh good, i was wondering why your mom didn't put you on when i talked to her earlier... anything new with you?" (i start to say something) "nothing, oh well i understand... i was out with bob all day... i don't want to run up your bill... life is nice when you're young and you can do what you want... enjoy it for all you've got, ok, grandma loves you, bye"  what is that?,.,, seriously... i don't get it.

      after an afternoon and evening being a weiss (it was family, plus an aunt, uncle, and cousin i met at halloween, plus grandparents, and then me), they sent me home with way too many leftovers again, so i'm at eric's sharing the wealth  his korean roommate, joon, who shares a phoneline with eric is proud of himself that he's finally learned how to spell my name, just came out to wash dishes while eric and me were dishing up food, and was like "hey, i heard your name in a song... what's it called, 'cocobanana'?"... eric's response "um, copacabana?"  joon, "yes, that's it, (starts singing) her name is laura,...."  dude, my life is weird.  (and no, the actual song doesn't say "laura", it says "lola"... on non-american ears that's close enough =P) the end.

      (1) paul ellis came with me to church again today... he really really likes pastor j., and seems to enjoy the other people too... funny result though, all the sudden after me coming mostly by myself, or only with female visitors before (leigh, roommate... or my parents), since paul's been in church with me every day this weekend, some friends stopped me on the way out to ask if he was my new boyfriend, and i had to go through the whole paragraph again "(1) paul has a girlfriend, so most definitely no, (2) i kinda get along with paul, but not a lot, so again, even more definitely NO, (3) i'm a math person, 90% of math people are guys, so 90% of my jersey friends are guys, so chances are it means absolutely nothing for me to be running around with one or another of them for a few days"  conclusion... duuuuuuuuuuuude  (2) easter dinner w/ the weiss's in an hour -- i'm excited... i like being in a family here especially as mine is far away and most of the people i know here are fellow students =)  it's even more ideal, because i get the family environment, them being interested in what i'm up to and looking out for me, but not them telling me what to do or lecturing me =)  i get adults who care about me as well as peers... i'm getting all prosaic or something... i'm happy. =)  (3) when i survive this week, it's gonna be great -- saturday is back to philly to see jessica again... yay for happy plans =)  time to find some comfy clothes for the afternoon... later dudes!  happy easter!!! =)

      so, easter has been my absolute favorite holiday from when i was little on... the flowers, the trumpets, the music, everything.,... and when i was small, the egg hunts weren't bad either, but over the years, even if i don't like the candy as much, it's still my favorite,... and for more important reasons... it's all about life!  last year easter was at valpo as usual... my brother had just driven up to visit for the weekend... nicole, and roommate, and heather were all around, and nicole's brother john was just starting out as a freshman at valpo... so me and nicole were both way excited about sharing the day with brothers... after michelle was around too and the 5 of us hosted a huge potluck for tons and tons of people at our apartment... it was a quality day. =) picture below: my brother, me, nicole, john, heather, roommate at the valpo chapel last easter:   yeah, it was a good day. =)  but yeah... now this year, my family's in TN, brother included and looking at major changes,... roommate, heather, and michelle are off on their own adventures in various places around the country, nicole's brother john is still at valpo, and nicole's been gone well over 7 months now... things can change soooo much in just a year!....  i guess that's one thing that's refreshing about holidays... situations and circumstances change, but the core of what they're really all about doesn't change, no matter who you're with or how you celebrate.  easter's all about life... how Christ gave His life and then rose again so we can have life abundantly and eventually be in heaven with Him... completely all about life... =)... nicole gets to be in on the coolest easter celebration ever today, which is awesome... it's interesting what sets the memories going again, but in a good way, you know?...  meanwhile, i'm excited to share the day with my new church family... it'll be good =)  this is all reflective and somewhat sappy and whatever, but there it is -- easter in a nutshell.  well, actually... the source says it all even better:  At dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene & the other Mary went to look at the tomb. There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven & going to the tomb, rolled back the stone & sat on it. His appearance was like lightning,  his clothes were white as snow. The guards were so afraid of him that they shook & became like dead men. The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.  He is not here; He has risen just as He said!  Come & see the place where He lay.  Then go quickly & tell His disciples." So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy. Matthew 28: 1-8  He is Risen! Happy Easter!!!! =)

      dude  so after sleeping til noon, i had a pretty good day.  first, on the list -- shoe shopping... it's officially warm enough to be wearing sandals again, so i got some without holes in the soles... this is always an adventure because i have freakin huge feet for a girl (i generally wear size 11 or 11.5 womens (which is cerca size 9 in mens))... i actually found myself some tennis shoes i liked amongst the women's shoes, and then got some sandals out of the guys shoes section... they're pretty generic, (i.e. there's nothing about them that screams they only belong on guy feet =P (except for the fact that they fit my feet and don't have a double digit size!)), and they were tons more comfortable than any of the sandals in the girls shoes section... anyhow, new shoes, yay  next on the list: sears.  i just noticed last weekend where there was a sears near me and was excited... my favorite pair of jeans is still barely wearable but won't be for long, so i had to go on the hunt for replacement, and then got carried away with the tradition from when i was little of finding myself an "easter dress", so i got a skirt i absolutely loved and a nice shirt too... and they're amazingly enough not black, navy blue, or grey (the 3 colors i'm wearing 90% of the time)... (and amazingly enough, i actually bought dress clothes... duuuude, what's wrong with me?!?!)... i was pleased, and even now, 10 hours later am still happy w/ my purchases... all 3 pieces of clothing, plus both pairs of shoes all for under $90... and the shoes were half of it!  after sears, i met leigh at barnes and noble and she graded and i worked on graph theory... there's only 5 problems this week and i worked a bit on all of them but i'm not so happy with any of them.  so it goes.  after i worked with leigh for around 3.5 hours, eric called me up and was like "dude, when are we eating dinner... i'm starving!", soooo, we went to subway, and then to rent mooovies... tonight's reviews:  blade runner: (first time either of us saw it) eric: 5/10 me: 4/10 eric's commentary, "what the heck?  and the moral of this is... don't be an android?"  aladdin: (eric's seen it a bazillion times before since it's one of his sister's favorites, it was actually my first time ever to see it!) eric: 7/10 me: 8/10 eric's commentary before: "dude, i can't believe you've never seen this... i'm going to stop being your friend if you don't absolutely love it... and i can say that, because i know you will!" eric's commentary after, (jokingly) "dude, i don't know if i'm ever again watching a disney movie with you that you haven't already seen before." my first time ever review of aladdin... "party!" =)  so yeah, it was fun.... and that's my day... clothes, math, and movies... duuude.... more in a little... first to do some organizing of the mess that is my room right now =P

      dude, hello 2am, it's been a looong afternoon/evening.... i think mostly because i've been so many places with so many different people in the last 12 hours  church was at 7:30 tonight and i left super early since traffic was sooo bad yesterday, but it was all good tonight, no backup at all... go figure... paul came to church w/ me again, only drove himself this time and met me there... he plans to show up for easter too.  good friday and christmas eve were the two services a year that completely freaked me out when i was little (christmas eve b/c of the hot wax from the candles everyone gets at the end of the service, good friday b/c of the dark and loud noise at the end)... now it's symbolic, unscary, but reflective and thought-provoking.  after church, rather than show up at jared's for no-math night in a dress, i went home, cleaned up the mess i made getting ready and changed into normal clothes and showed up at jareds... leigh's sick, colleen's home for the weekend, trevor just picked up and went to paris yesterday (it's trevor, don't ask), john disappeared for the weekend, and i was 2 hours late on account of church so the crowd was sparse... i got there and sam, eric, jared, and scott were sitting around the dinner table chatting about random stuff... i helped them eat the leftover portabellos from dinner and we all had ice cream (well, everyone but scott who we're all pretty sure is hooking up with jared's housemate vicki)... it was nice to be there, chat for a bit, but not be in the middle of a huge crowd... small group relaxed time... completely ideal!  after ice cream, jared and sam were going to watch some random dvd that i had little interest in, but eric and me rented jerry mcguire last night (neither of us had seen it before), so we took off to my place and watched it (starting at like dude... 11pm)... just finished and both of us loved it and give it 9/10 on the new mooovie ranking system. =)  now, after overanalyzing everyone's life in the department with eric as usual, i'm off to read myself to sleep... exciting eh?  later dudes, good night to all y'all.

      dude, what a night...  so i picked up paul for church around 7... normally it would take me about 20 minutes to get to church from where he lives, but some roads are undergoing major construction which just got majorly worse this week... so it took us 40 minutes and we got there just before the sermon hymn... oops.  pretty much the same maundy thursday order of worship i'm used to.  at the end, with the stripping of the altar, bonnie, the team leader for my altar guild team tapped me on the shoulder and told me i could help if i wanted, and so i did.... it's cool to be part of a church family, know people, and be involved rather than just passively present. =)  paul plans to come with me to church tomorrow and on sunday too, so i guess that's a good sign that he was cool with the place... from what he's said he comes from a very very conservative lcms congregation back in indiana (near valpo), but has visited many many other kinds of churches, etc. out of curiousity too... it was interesting to chat with him for the drive to and from.  after i dropped paul back off at his place, eric and me ran around for quite some time... first, after mooovie night last saturday we started making a list of mooovies that neither of us have seen (tomorrow night is jerry mcguire night i think), or that one or the other has seen and thinks the other should... we returned last week's mooovie and rented tomorrow's... went to walmart, and played with sunglasses, and sniffed just about every scented candle on the shelves (i bought 3 because i'm down to just one in my room again that has any wick), and then went back to his place to finish homework... after homework, we started preliminarily planning trips for this summer and it's going to be nuts!  so i have a dentist appointment in memphis on july 14th... eric doesn't want to go home in early july, and wants to go farther north to see grandparents, etc., so it doesn't make sense to include memphis on the vegas trip, so the plan is i'll be in memphis from whenever til the 14th, then drive back up to jersey the 15th-16th or 15th-17th depending on how energetic i feel... then... insanity begins!  i booked a flight (for under $150!!!!!!) from newark to vegas for the afternoon of july 18th that's a sunday... we'll be in vegas so i can see all the fun stuff on the 19th, and drive the 45 minutes to the rollercoaster at the NV/CA border just so i can say i was in california too!  then east to the grand canyon, and north to stay with one of eric's friends in provo... then north to yellowstone, then east to mount rushmore, then more east to MN, valpo area, detroit (eric's grandma's place), pittsburgh, and back to jersey... we're not sure how many days we'll take, but for sure at least a week, maybe closer to two... and that's what... six?!?! new states? (CA, NV, AZ, UT, WY, and SD)... completely freaking out that this is going to be the coolest road trip ever!  i can't wait!!!!) p.s. if you live along this general route (i think mostly I-90 til chicago) anywhere between NV and IN or will be somewhere on this general route in late july, let me know so we can crash at your place ;-P  at any rate, it's freakin 2:15am and i have to be up in 6 hours... maybe it's time to pick the contacts out of my eyes and get some sleep... night y'all!

      was late to my only class today because of traffic... took me 20 minutes to get to campus instead of the usual 10... turned out i was only the second one there and class started 15 minutes late anyhow... oh well.  worked on algebra homework all day.  this week's homework is extremely frustrating because it covers a whole chapter in the book which he covered in about one lecture.  no one knows what's going on... at least when i left campus just now, i have an idea of something coherent to write for each problem and that's good.  it's yucky rainy today... go figure.  and this is from someone who loooves rain.  got 2 hours to eat, patch clothes, write up algebra, and get ready for church.  it'll be interesting... my church is holding a seder in half an hour (5:30ish) that you had to make advanced reservations for... going through the whole traditional seder stuff, but making the stuff around the 3rd cup of wine (the cup of redemption) into Christian parallels... i didn't have time or $$, so i didn't sign up.  i'm not sure if the "7:30 holy communion" on the church schedule is part of that and paul and me will be joining a bunch of people who have been around all evening, or if it's after... we'll find out i guess.  amanda just got home as i was unlocking the door... she seemed disappointed i was just getting home instead of just leaving... oh well.

      just woke up to a phone call from paul (aka crazy crutch guy to some... he's not on crutches anymore though =P)... the first thing out of his mouth was "so when's church at your church tonight and tomorrow and how do you get there because i'm going even if you can't....."  he talks too fast... i had to make him repeat 3 times before i was awake enough to digest what had come out of his mouth.  apparently i'm giving paul a ride to church today (maundy thursday) and tomorrow (good friday).  this shall be interesting.  for easter though, the weiss's are adopting me for the day again... i like this =)  now time to get my class on... then homework til it's time to go... joy.  later dudes.

      so i went to campus to work on homework with people.  i've realized one thing in the last week.  i like colleen lots and enjoy doing non-math things with her, but actually working on math with her gives me a headache.  we were fine and having fun earlier, but tonight i was working on algebra and she was still writing up some lie groups stuff and kept calling me over to help her with it.  only she wouldn't take explanations, she wanted to ask lots more questions than the assignment called for answering (there's absolutely nothing wrong with that)... mostly we just have very different approaches in general... i want to move along and finish all the task-based stuff i need to do (finish exactly what i need to write down to turn in for homework, nothing more nothing less) first, and that done, return to figuring out general theory... i'm not sure how to describe her approach, but it's not that and i feel like we step on each others toes a lot in the process... and both get annoyed with each other... oops.  anyhow, to make a long story short, after working for a little, i got frustrated with the cacophony of a dozen people working on homework for 3 different classes in the same room (in the graduate lounge), packed up, and came home to figure out stuff on my own.  i'm trying to figure out who amanda just brought home... she and some guy are in her room, but his voice sounds too high to be ron (her boyfriend)... i'm guessing it's the same guy she had over and in her room the other time someone was here besides ron... mostly it's funny because they came home and she started singing a church song, and then he started singing another one, made puns on the words, and she blurted out "hey, let's talk about our favorite hymns!"... this is just completely amusing to me because (1) i'm factoring a stupid 8 by 8 matrix, and there's alternating drunk roommate and random guy singing church songs 2 doors away (my life is so weird), and (2) amanda hasn't gone to church once that i'm aware of the whole time we've been living together (except when home with her family), so while i know her family's catholic, it's highly unusual for her to be running around singing hymns, much less having duets of them with random people late at night.  you know what?  enough rambling.  you know my life is weird... i'm back to diagonalizing this stupid matrix.  later dudes.

      leigh helped me with homework some more and now i'm by myself in her office whle other people are working in the graduate lounge... i'm in a weird mood... not good, not bad, but moving extremely fast and fidgety and feeling hyper-analytical at present (don't ask me to explain that... either you understand or you don't)  in reviewing my thoughts, attitudes, and actions over the past however long that i've been claiming to be "in a weird mood" it's like the monster in my head is back.  halfway through valpo, friends made me see the campus shrink and he verified that i had moderate clinical depression.  it's hard to explain but during that year or two there, it was like no matter what i tried to do there was this imaginary monster burden in my head looking for the bad in even the best things i had going on... there was no reason to be sincerely happy about anything.  i'm far from that point (in the good direction), but thinking about it, i think half my problem lately is (1) thinking too much about everything and (2) the same thought patterns that were there before have crept in again while i've been insanely stressed over the past however long and are attacking again... they're like weeds... you think you get rid of them, but the roots are always deeper than you quite seem to reach to and even if you try to put up a good front and really believe it, the roots are still hiding there and growing back.  this is a really weird entry... i'm going to stop for now.  eric found me a spiffy way to make money this summer if carolyn (last summer's boss) doesn't have long distance work for me.  filling out surveys for companies online... i'll probably sign up for it whether carolyn has work for me or not... that'll be good.  ok, really, the end.  hour til class... i'm going to read or something halfway constructive rather than type type type type type =P

      the current plot:  i *should* be asleep.  usually wednesday i don't have anywhere to be til 3pm, but scott's pizza seminar talk last week ran long and he asked for a second day to finish it... we all have to go be supportive, so i'm up and getting ready so i can go eat pizza and listen to scott talk about logic in an hour and a half... joy.  random thoughts and observations:  *why is that when people leave a note to themselves to do something, they often put punctuation marks?  (like !!!)  i was thinking about this as i did dishes last night... amanda has a neon green postit note on the fridge that says "take vitamins!!!"  if the neon green and the words already remind you, what's the added benefit of "!!!" for?  that's just one example, i know i do it too... the important things on to do lists often get !!! after them, but... why do we all do that?  discuss.  *i can't sleep anymore.  i just can't.  some people say they need at least 8, 9, 10 however many hours of sleep.  i apparently am not capable for sleeping more than 8 in a row, and often not even that.  (1) when i go to sleep, i toss and turn a lot before i fall asleep (2) i often wake up in the middle of the night thinking of things i have to do, or "just because"... (e.g. i vaguely remember waking up last night at 4am with a jerk, decided i was cold, went through my closet in the dark to find a sweatshirt, decided i didn't want it anymore b/c i'd get too warm, hung it back up, and went back to sleep) (3) i wake up early with a jerk too, think i'm ready to go and convince myself the extra hour of trying to sleep will be good for me this usually happens around 6, around 7, around 8, pretty much every morning hour until my alarm actually tells me to get up...  dude, what's wrong with me?  no wonder i'm tired all the time!  *studying math is such a weird (but usually fascinating) discipline... most people study topics and thoughts and stuff that have to do with society (humanities... or anything that involves english words)... even in the other sciences, people see direct applications to "normal life" too,... it's not that math can't be applied to "real life" because it totally can, but mostly people working on a Ph.D. in math are studying math topics because they (the topics) are there, and because the solutions are unknown... kinda like a treasure hunt... not *because* it's going to provide some scientific breakthrough down the line... we manipulate crazy objects you can't see with crazy rules, trying to figure out as much as possible about them.  all our discussions use huge crazy complex concepts no one understands but math people.  it's beautiful stuff... i just wish my brain could input more of it at once.  the end... see, i'm in a weeeeird mood this week.  later dudes.

      so, i've emailed last summer's boss to see if she'll rehire me to "telecommute" for the summer... we'll see if this works.  mom called, approves of all the road trips and also wanted to let me know... dad ended up turning down the ohio job offer b/c it was too administrative for his tastes, but apparently some commercial land developer is considering buying our property.  dad named a price of 3 times what he and mom paid for it, and the developer said he'd come back with an offer in the next 30 days.  dad went and talked to one of his real estate friends who drew up a contract for said amount and said if this developer doesn't take it, he'll sell it for that amount to someone else, be ready to move in the next 30 days... dad said 30 days notice is impossible w/ all the animals and stuff, so his friend said, then he can get him 90 days at best, but be ready to be outta there anytime.  this means i probably won't ever get to visit the house i grew up in ever again. (it's so decrepit it'll most likely get bulldozed)... this makes me sad.  analysis makes me sad too.  after our miserable algebra class, i worked on analysis from 11:30 straight til 1, had lunch with eric at subway, then worked straight from 2 til 6:30 again... still not all the way done and need to write up all kinds of junk... i'm in a tired, grumpy, bad attitude all around kinda mood, so i told leigh if anyone figures out the last part of a problem we don't know how to do, call me, otherwise i'll keep my bad attitude to myself for the evening... and that's exactly what i plan to do.  later.

      so only 4 of us showed up for algebra today... given it's our earliest class (9:50) so it's a stretch for people to be up then, and given the prof. doesn't give the most coherent lectures so people seem to take turns skipping class, but this was definitely a record low... usual attendance is around 10 people even though it's a class of 15 or so... 4 was just plain miserable.  we went over our evil midterms from a couple weeks ago... it makes low grades look so much nicer when they're only out of 4 points instead of out of 100.... all grades were basically 2.5, 2.75, or 3 out of 4... not the best, but all pretty close too.... he decided to go over related problems to the test the whole time... at one point he asked a question and said my name in particular... i had no idea so i gave him a blank stare until he moved on and answered it himself... i'm such a bad student. =P  no graph theory today... prof. kahn is off doing who knows what... subway when eric gets out of number theory, then homework forever, as usual.  later dudes.

      a few people have astutely noted that lara just isn't quite happy unless she has a roadtrip in the works... well check out the margin, now there's a bunch in the works!  *"top secret roadtrip" in may... several of you know about it, but some shouldn't yet, (so i can be all surprising and stuff)... excited about that *memphis roadtrip -- dentist, renew license plates, and fun stuff like that  but the most exciting one...  *vegas roadtrip... this probably needs explanation, especially as i don't have a summer job planned yet... eric's going home (to las vegas, yes, the one in nevada) for the first half of the summer... when he returns, he plans to bring back a car instead of just flying.  eric's not as gung ho about roadtrips as me, so he also wants company for the trip... sooo, we've been joking about me flying out there and being his roadtrip buddy to bring the car back, but today we pinky swore on it and agreed to set specific dates and book me a flight in the near future... vegas, grand canyon, and for sure at least a handful of new states in the "great out west"... this shall be a party.  how's the homework?  leigh and i worked for 4 hours and eric joined us for the last 1.5 or so... we got the two "easy" problems done in that time... maybe i'm slow, but i did it myself without major help and know what's going on... joy. =P  sleep time. night y'all!

      blah.  so i thought i was done with lie groups last night... then we got our first assignment back in class today and i decided if no one else was turning it in today, i should maybe work on it a little more anyhow.  that class makes me mad... it could be so much better if the prof came to class organized for once... really.  on the other hand, i got back a decent grade on last week's analysis that i didn't even go to visit jared for help on, and i mostly followed today's lecture... that was good.  all i almost ever talk about anymore is math homework... isn't my life exciting?  daylight savings time in screwing with my head... how can it be 7:30 and this light outside... well, obviously it is, and i've been doing stuff for the whole inbetween time... bought a bunch of easter cards to write to aunts, uncles, grandmothers, and the like and wrote out 12 of them.  fun, eh?  now, back to campus to work on analysis with leigh... to be followed by some fun reading... i'm in the middle of reading  the house on the strand  by daphne dumaurier (her most famous book is  rebecca ... read *that* for HS summer reading one year)... it's fun... people going back in time when they take some drug made out of monkeys' brains or something... bizarre, but i'm hooked and i've barely started.  anyhow, being organized and getting myself outta here... later dudes.

      in a bookstore yesterday:  scott: (picking a book off the shelf) "hey lara,  ten minutes from normal ... is this your biography?" eric: "dude, no, her biography woudl be  ten  years  from normal !"  dude... at least i have a reputation as unique?  in other news, got yet another newsy email from another of my hungarian friends... they've one by one all been writing me in a spurt lately... i miss them all... i want to go back.  roommate said next summer (2005)... i can't really afford it right now anyhow.  blah.  but, i miss budapest, and all my friends there.  class, lunch, homework, class as usual... outta get to it.  later dudes.

      i've decided that if dr. woodward feels no obligation to present his lectures clearly (several times per class he stops and gets confused and finds errors and re-does everything), i have no obligation to turn in clearly written homework.  i wrote up 6 sheets (front and back) of half solutions to homework for him that's due tomorrow and i don't care anymore... it's done.  tomorrow's a new day... to start on non- lie groups homework... joy.  (fun) reading, then to sleep.

      so despite the fact that i gave him a wakeup call and a 5 minute warning call, paul overslept, and didn't make it to church this AM... go figure... another time i guess.  lunchtime, then homework forever... apparently scott and eric want to work at a bookstore, so the two of them and colleen are waiting on me to finish eating and get myself over to campus to drive with them.... joy.  homework all afternoon... i can't wait. =P

      so, for a day that started out a cranky toe sock day (see next paragraph if that confuses you =P), it ended pretty alright.... well alright, but a little confused.  (for reference, half of my christmas present from roooommate (aka kristin) this year was a pair of toe socks that have a frown face on each toe, and the word cranky and more frown faces all over the rest of them... they came the day before my analysis final last semester, and have been an excellent way to make myself laugh whenever i've felt especially grumpy since)  as aforereferenced, i woke up in a bad mood that didn't have any plans for getting better... but,   3-3:30pm: lunch @ subway w/ eric 3:30-6pm: algebra homework at starbucks w/ eric (we may not have solved more than 1/4, but we at least know what they're asking now... that's a start, right?) 6-7:30pm: grocery shopping/moooovie shopping w/ eric again 7:30-8pm: dinner 8-1am: moooovie time  while at the grocery store though i got a random call from paul, a second year around here (if you've visited me, you might have met him and refered to him as creepy crutch guy)... he wants me to stop by his house on the way to church here and let him follow me and come to church w/ me, and then he'll go someplace else after... i was very confused, but whatever, that's the plan now.  otherwise, eric and me watched mooovies... i've been so excited about brother bear coming out on video-... i saw it with margie when she visited me just before thanksgiving and thought it was great... got the soundtrack at the nyc disney store when i was there with rooommate last month, and this week the movie actually came out on video... when i saw it at the grocery store i had to buy it, and eric commented "if you're gonna continue to quote it and sing the songs from it so much i might as well get it over with and see the darn thing"... and so we did... i still loved it just as much as before and was glad i bought it... eric commented that it threw him off guard from the start and was completely different from what he expected... he gave it 7/10 all the way until the last 3 minutes, which he thought were a little too cheesy... nonetheless, i own brother bear.  since i picked brother bear, eric got to pick the other moovie... he keeps a running list on his computer of ones he wants to see and why, and is a big kevin spacey fan, so he wrote down "a time to kill" and "the negotiator" as ones to look into tonight... however, we looked for "a time to kill" under the "T"'s and neglected to find it, so negotiator was mooovie of choice... it helps to note, i don't do well with gun violence... the plot was extremely intriguing and i enjoyed it immensely for that, but every time a gun went off, i was pretty tense for the next 10 minutes or so, which meant i was pretty stressed through large parts of the movie.  if you're unfamiliar with it samuel l. jackson is a chicago cop who's famous for negotiating hostage situations, however in the first 5 minutes he gets framed for his partner's murder... then he ends up taking a hostage situation and playing out the police to try to prove his innocence (kevin spacey is the new police negotiator that gets called in)... it was complex and interesting and quality,... i just have a hard time watching people's heads get blown off.  (eric on the other hand commented he thinks it's a boy thing to distinguish between the guns contained in the tv and real life ones and so it doesn't bother him in the least).... either way, whatever... we both gave both movies cerca 7/10, so mooovie night was a success...  dude, 2:30 according to new daylight savings time... i hate loosing an hour... would much rather gain an hour every time and just be nocturnal every few years... wouldn't that be much better?  at any rate, time for sleep, no matter how awake or not i think i am... later dudes =P

      woke up this morning after horrible horrible bad dreams (planes exploding, people dying, yucky stuff in general) to think "dude, i'm in a bad mood" and went right back to sleep to not have to deal with myself for a bit.  eventually decided that the only thing that was going to keep my bad mood from getting worse was keeping busy, so eric and me went to subway and then worked on algebra at starbucks all afternoon... now after grocery shopping, and movie hunting, it's dinner and mooovie night... brother bear (my choice... i bought it -- i've been excited since i saw it last november w/ margie in the theater) and the negotiator (eric's choice)... reviews later tonight.  can you get much more of a contrast?  later dudes.

      this from a friend's IM profile: To summarize: it is a well known fact, that those people who most want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job. To summarize the summary of the summary: people are a problem.  politics aside, the last line is a favorite tonight.  it's 10 til midnight and i think when i'm done venting i'll go to sleep.  last you tuned in i was off to no-math night dinner and then other misc... turns out just the first happened, and i left early (11) and now i'm home and going to crash instead.  i'll grant you i've been in a super weird rollercoaster kind of mood lately... there's all kinds of things to "blame" it on, but regardless, for whatever reason, i have been and that's that.  maybe this is just my attitude flaring up again, maybe not, but i'm tired of people.  don't get me wrong, i love my friends, i like individual people, but the concept of people as a whole is getting to me lately.  take for example "no math night"... it started out as an organized routine -- get the week's grocery shopping done together, cook as much food as possible for a dozen people with as little money per person required as possible, play sheepshead until we all fall asleep,... and with rare exception that was the plot all last fall.  that was fun.  this semester no math night moved from on campus to jared and mike's house off campus.  it kept the general format at first but now has changed... instead of group planning of meals or taking turns deciding the entrees, jared goes out and buys a ton of stuff and has the menu planned when we get there (just fine, jared's an amazing chef) instead of trying to be as economical as possible, though, prices have been rising... jared likes to cook gourmet-ish type things and buys quality stuff... the food is to die for... but then again, i'm not sure i have $10 a week to splurge on limited servings i could make for myself for much less.  but even money aside, because really, whatever, i waste tons of it anyhow. the atmosphere's been changing too... instead of "let's all cook together" and then "let's all play cards together", no math night has kinda turned into weekly house party at jared's place.  for some people, this is great, for me it's not.  when the sole source of entertainment for the evening is mingling, and there's bunches of new people coming each week, i freak out.  don't get me wrong, i love people, i enjoy meeting new people, i enjoy chatting with people, but i do much much better one on one or in smaller groups and gradually phasing new people in (instead of feeling outnumbered and overwhelmed) and with something more concrete to do with myself besides "mingling".   things have gradually been changing in all of the above ways for a bit, and tonight i just couldn't deal with it after a point... being around so many people (and like half a dozen i'd never met before) just standing around talking and whatever wears me out... i played cards with ben and eric for a little in another room, chatted with them while scott, mike, and sam came through every so often, ate, then hung out with vicki, scott, and eric for awhile... the food was phenominal, but the small bit of salmon and the pasta i got was not $9... and when i left at 11, the pies they had made still needed an hour to cool... my brain couldn't take it anymore and i just left.  eric and me both talked about how the new dynamic of friday nights frustrates us, and scott talked a little about it with me too, although for him this is more ideal... i dunno.  my weird mood continues, i'm not mad at anyone really, just tired... tonight was more wearing on my nerves than fun... i don't know what i'll do in future weeks, but i don't see a need to spend $10 to give myself a headache.  whatever.  maybe this is partly just my weird mood flaring up again.  i dunno...   either way, i'm tired, and for once i'm giving the computer a break (both my desktop and my laptop are getting completely turned off tonight), turning off the phone, and crashing til i feel like getting up in the AM.  good night.

      eric just called... first thing out of his mouth, "hey!  so i'm a real person again!"  he had to give the number theory seminar talk this week which means he's mostly been locked in his room for the past 7 days stressing about it and cramming his head full of modular forms and crazy stuff like that without even time for a starbucks run... since eric's my chief partner in crime around here though, that makes for a little bit of me being bored when we'd otherwise be on ferry hunts or graveyard hunts or csilag bulis or something... anyhow, i'm glad his talk is done so he's unstressed again.  tonight's going to be a little different... there's always no math nght, which, this semester is dinner and cards at jared's house every time... however, john's girlfriend is visiting this weekend, jared's girlfriend is apparently visiting every weekend now, and jared's best friend and his wife are both supposed to be around too.  i'm in a weird mood and all about dealing with people i know, but not as much about dealing with lots of people i don't... eric's not so keen on playing cards as much anymore, so we made a pact so show up at jared's for dinner, then leave after for starbucks and a movie (either star wars or renting something we both actually agree on)... who knows.  i'm just glad my friend is back to being a real person again =P

      done did it indeed... talked to amanda just now and asked her about next year...  she wants to live further south because of hospital rotations and driving time, so no problem... i just don't like starting conversations that have the potential to be a little sticky whether they likely will be or not... like a certain someone said last week i think too much about everything... so it goes.  i've had my tv fun tonight... now it's homework time.

      troy just got fired! duuuuude!  that was the weirdest episode of apprentice yet.  when my two favorite players (troy and kwame) went to the boardroom, i was like "duuuude"... they did end on good terms though instead of fighting over something petty like lots of the characters have been doing... now that it's down to 4, i'm totally pulling for kwame, but we'll see.  the end.

      outtakes... you know, the corny bits and pieces at the end of a movie... here's the outtakes from my day =P... not especially corny, but bits and pieces indeed they are:  2:40pm: arrive at analysis class... jared and sam are the only other ones there jared: wow, lara, you look horrible today! me: i hope you just mean my raccoon eyes jared: well yeah, you look beat me: actually it was the first night i got enough sleep in 2 weeks sam: yeah, getting enough sleep has the tendency to make people look bad... unfortunate... you'll be better tomorrow (that's affirming, eh?... oh well)  4:35pm: (dropping eric off at band rehearsal) me: hey dude, punch buggie blue! eric: (dives out of the car... since we're at his stop anyhow) no punches!!!! (quite hilarious)  5pm: watched the first hour of blues brothers... never had seen the beginning before... laughed my head off  6-8pm: tgi fridays with leigh and colleen... like the 2nd "math girl time" all year with none of the guys... it was fun  8-9pm: on the phone with rooommate... i like talking to roommate =)  9-11pm: baking cookies, and curled up watching "bend it like beckham" (had seen it on the big screen when it first came out... bought it when alliswan was here and hadn't had time to watch my copy since i bought it... i forgot how great the credits were... it was a party and a half =) )  11-midnight: listening to the "brother bear" soundtrack & mass email fun, now i'm getting replies, which is even funner!  visontlatasra!

      news bit #1 (classification: annoying):  my arm hurts... =(  i got a sunburn 2.5 weeks ago at valpo graduation... the little bit of my head/collar that burned pealed pretty quickly... my arm just started to this afternoon and it's making me sad =(  news bit #2 (classification: good): i have a job to do!  i was supposed to call my memphis boss at 9 tonight, which i did (8 her time) so that she'd be in the office (which is attached to her house) but not expecting regular business hours calls... my first task will be to assemble a database of emails of potential sponsors for fishing expos in mississippi... how much fun is that?  mostly, i'll be glad to have some structure in my life  news bit #3 (classification: exceedingly frustrating): i really need to work on my being able to occupy myself ability... like today -- after dave and dave headed out, it's been me, the tv, the stereo, and the computer... all day long... i've been productive and not even had time for dinner yet even though it's nearly 10! (yes, i did have lunch)... while i'm capable of occupying my own time with books, movies, etc.... i go really stircrazy when i don't get to interact face to face with anyone, but i have no money so i can't just go shopping either to interact with people... it's just a quick jump from lots of people every day to almost no one every day... i used to laugh at g-ma pudwell (not meanly, but didn't understand her) when she said she often goes to buy little things she doesn't need at walmart/kmart/target etc., just so she can chat with the clerks despite the fact that she has neighbors, two brothers within an hour of her, a boyfriend, etc. and in general, there's people for her to visit with... but really, i think, looking ahead to a month of working at home on my computer and with a roommate who i get along with but don't do things with or really talk to about anything besides bills, i see a little bit of her point.  news bit #4 (classification: very good!): to remedy point #3 at least moderately tomorrow... ben and i have plans to catch the 1pm matinee of "main hoon na", and indian movie with subtitles that's playing relatively near here (see  http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&cf=info&id=1808559133   hopefully it'll be good =)  i'm out of news... for someone who's talked to themselves for the last 14 hours, i sure type a lot =P

      so i finished posting pictures and landed on vh1.. they're doing a special of the "top 50 most awesomely bad songs ever"... only i'm not watching it for that they think you should be watching for  as far as their picks, 2/3 really do belong on the list...  but billy joel's "we didn't start the fire" for example shouldn't be if their reasoning is "pop music cool, history not cool, try again"... while maybe not like the absolute best song of the century, it IS a unique song from when someone told billy joel none of the good history happened before '80 or so, and he started writing the world events of his life and found a beat to it... it's catchy, and a trip through the last 50 years... or bette midler's "from a distance" being even higher up on the list because "God watching us all the time is just a creepy concept" -- whatever; they're not analyzing quality/unquality of music, they're picking on songs that conflict with their "we're vh1 and therefore we're cool" philosophy ;-P  nah, mostly i'm watching because the comedians, singers, magazine editors, actors, and commetators they have analyzing are completely ridiculous -- they all have such a serious "i'm a world expert on this" look pasted on their faces, and they all sound so dumb, full of themselves, and mostly ridiculous... it's more like watching a car wreck of commentators than of bad music videos like they intended... oh well... that's my morning entertainment, eh? =P

      it's an "in-between day" and i'm tired.... inbetween because the daves left at 8 this morning and i have nothing to do/no one to talk to until i call my boss in memphis at 9 tonight to get my first assignment of the summer  tired because i slept for only 4 hours... after reading the email from nicole's parents/looking at the pictures of her stuff they sent, i cried for a bit, and then was thinking for awhile... it was 3:30 before i was calm enough to sleep and i woke up at 7:30 to help the daves move their stuff to the car and wish them farewell  the crying's weird and makes me feel sick... i mean it's normal to miss people after they've died and there's nothing wrong with the fact that i'm still grieving nicole's death in a way already 9 months since she died... but it's weird what happens to set it off from time to time... there's nothing in particular distressing about pictures of her stuff -- i mean, the girl loved smiley faces, they were very cheerful pictures of stuffed animals, smiley faces, books, and masks... just the fact that together they represent someone i cared about a lot, and the fact that those pictures being sent out means that that stuff is being distributed out since the person they belong to doesn't need them anymore... yeah, i dunno... but it distressed me for a bit to read and look... i wrote back and asked nicole's parents for a large smiley face pillow she always kept on her bed at valpo... when i was stressed out and chatting with her about whatever was on my mind, nicole would sometimes let me hold the pillow... if no one asked for it before i did, then i can still have it as some sort of security blanket when i'm stressed out =)  i'd like that.  it was a little sad to say goodbye to the daves too... like not the same kind of sad, but like it was fun to have them around and now my summer will start a less exciting working pace for a bit... i also just really liked having a valpo friend visit... one of the chief things i miss about valpo is hugs =)... it sounds a little weird, but it's true... amongst my friends at valpo it's not weird to give someone a hug or put your arm around their shoulders or whatever, and it doesn't mean anything out of the ordinary; just that's what people do.... with my math friends, both guys and girls, the most anyone does is a high five or something for the most part... that's fine and it's just a completely different group of people to interact with, but really, i miss the hugs... it was good to have them back for a few days at least =P  so yeah, the end... oh, that, and i posted pictures of NY from this weekend --  http://www.eden.rutgers.edu/~lpudwell/photoalbum.html#nyc  --  enjoy =P  later dudes =P

      ...or at least as lazy as i get =P  was up early again to get ready for church and leave time for the daves to get ready too... even though all the weiss's (my adopted family there) except mr. weiss (who was ushering) were out of town, it was good to be back at good shepherd... it was good to hear pastor j. again, and i was glad dave (beagley) had a chance to meet him... the other dave, who is catholic, also survived his first lutheran service =)  after that we dropped off my two rolls of film from our time in NYC off for 1 hour developing while we went for lunch at applebees... (will post the best ones tomorrow after they're gone again)  finally, we looked up movie times... apparently after seeing NYC in all its glory for the past two days, the daves wanted to see it destroyed by a tidal wave and 15 feet of snow, so we went to see "the day after tomorrow"... it was decent, but there were parts i hid under my jacket for... and so it goes  since then, it's been movie mania, part 2... we watched the indiana jones marathon on USA until it was done and then watched brother bear until now...  on the whole, a quality day... except one thing  i came back to my computer and had an email taking up half of my inbox -- update from my friend nicole's parents (nicole is my friend/roommate from valpo who died in september in a car wreck)... they're cleaning out her room this summer and wanted to know first what each of the roommates wanted of her stuff and sent several pictures of what all is in her room... it was hard to read and even harder to look through the pictures and i was quickly (and still am half an hour later) in tears... i kept myself busy doing dishes and stuff but asked beagley what was on TV when i went to lock the door and told him what was up when he asked... not that beagley and me are like super close like me and roommate or anything, but usually when i'm having another break down about nicole here, i'm not around anyone else who knew her, so at least the fact that he understood was nice... now to pretend to go to sleep... i don't know that it's gonna quite work though... gotta be up in 6.5 hours to say bye to the daves before they head out  night y'all

      it's been fun yet again... today was just me and the two daves... from all our walking yesterday, we're all extremely sore, so today was much slower.  mostly we wandered around times square for a bit, hitting up the toys r us and the hershey store because they were amused and not quite sure what to do in a world's largest toy store and i said that hershey smelled better than being out on the street ;-P  got lunch at the sbarro on broadway there, and then saw aida.  aida was amazingly good -- elton john music, tim rice lyrics, and extremely well staged too! e.g. one scene has a swimming pool, but they put a vertical screen of looking down on the swimming pool on the back of the stage and then people on invisible strings "swam" up through it... etc.... the storyline is that aida is the princess of nubia, but egypt is attacking and wiping out her country and she gets captured and made into a slave... a head egyptian army captain falls in love with her, only it's a problem b/c he's engaged to be married to the princess of egypt and b/c she's a slave... the captain makes arrangements for aida to escape the country during his wedding, but she decides she must help her father, the king of nubia, flee the country first... in the delay of getting him out as well, she and the captain are caught red-handed and sentenced to die by being buried alive.... the princess, i.e. the guy's wife, actually has mercy on them and sentences them to die in the same grave... then the play ends with them rediscovering each other (i.e. reincarnated) in a modern museum looking at an exhibit of artifacts from their previous life... the music, the staging, and the storyline were all fantastic -- i enjoyed it a lot =)  after aida, we headed down to the empire state building... last time i was there it was night and we just visited the 86th floor observatory... this time, the daves were game for the cheesy NY skyride... it was a similuation of a helicopter ride over the city narrated by kevin bacon... in seats that pick up and move around... cheesy to the umpteenth degree, but worth doing at least once... then something like 2 hours after we first got in line outside, we got to the top... it was still daylight, like an hour before sunset... got nice clear pictures all around.... =)  finally, caught the 8:14 train back to jersey and got some thai food for dinner...  i must say, i'm talented at making people do weird things... case in point: earlier in the day i spent intermission at the play convincing dave beagley he should sing songs on command... when i asked him if dave (his HS friend) sang, they both vehemently insisted no, not even 'happy birthday' (note, dave beagley is fairly quiet and as he likes to say, "low key"... dave, his HS friend, makes *him* seem outgoing!... both nice guys, but both very quiet and not (especially the not-beagley dave) easy to read a lot of the time)... however, on the train ride back, i said to dave beagley "and then dave sang a song about riding on the train -- go!" and he sang something to the effect of "we rode on the train oh yay"... when he was done, i turned to the other dave and said "and then you sang verse two -- go!" and he burst out in "hi ho the derio, we're riding on the train"... when beagley and i started laughing and reminded him that he said he never sings, he insisted i wouldn't see it happen again, and then later in the train trip he started singing a line on his own again... conclusion: i have power over making people do crazy things -- the end. =P  church tomorrow -- i'm really excited... i enjoyed valpo and roommate's church and heather's church, but i really missed good shepherd too... and that's a wrap ;-P  later dudes =P

      so the two daves got in around 11:30 last night... i showed them around the apartment (5 minutes), helped them move into my TV room, and then we all got some sleep  left for NYC around 10 this morning, picking up ben on the way to the train station... we got into the city around 11:30... the first part of the day was stuff i've done at least half a dozen times but none of them had... subway to the world trade center site, wandered around there, walked down to wall street (and actually got to go inside trinity church on the corner of wall st. and broadway -- that part was new for me), saw the stock exchange, got accosted by a guy promoting a strip club (that was new... mostly because me with a group of 3 guys and the guy didn't see me when he approached them), starbucks, brooklyn bridge, staten island ferry, and then booked it further north.  then, another first... it was pouring down rain, so we ran down to the UN (which i'd never been to before) and toook the tour of it while the rain poured... our tour was given by a cool kenyan guy named osodo... did you know... the UN buildings are joint territory of the 191 countries of the UN? (so in a twisted way i was in hungary and england and china and the US all at once ;-P) that the UN has its own post office with its own stamps that can only be used from that one post office?  and otehr exciting things... we got to see the security council chamber (the one you usually see in news stuff on TV) and i actually answered a question the tourguide asked us (too bad i never *used* to speak up in class!) =P  it was a quality trip.  after the UN, we walked through rockefeller center, st. patrick's cathedral, and central park before stopping at the NYC hard rock cafe for dinner... we each got drinks in the hurricane glasses that you get to keep -- me, a raspberry margarita =)  it was a party  now, tired and sore, we're all back!  and attacking the city again tomorrow :-P  later dudes! =P

      so i paid the bills i needed to, and then complained to ben about how bored i was... his solution? "hey, let's go see a movie!"  he convinced me to see "van helsing", which i had planned to avoid, but he saw a chick flick with me last time, so i figured i'd be brave and go along with one he was more excited about... on the whole the plot was good, i just freaked out every time a monster jumped out... even if the music hinted one was coming =P... however, unlike how ben hinted there would be claw marks on his arm just in time for when he starts teaching next week, he was wrong -- i just hide from the screen when i don't like it =P  anyhow, now i'm waiting for dave and the other dave to get in... i'm guessing at least another hour to wait... so it goes.  later dudes =P

      the problem is, i have no excuse to be bored... i had math i could be studying, email i could be catching up on, chores/cleaning around the apartment i should be doing, fun books i could be reading, movies i could be watching, mail i should be sorting through, and yet i'm sitting here whining... go me.  dave called eh 50 minutes ago and said he just got in to pennsylvania... either he and his friend (a) drive slower than me (b) make more stops than me or (c) both... this isn't hard to do... i drive in 2 and 3 hour chunks and generally don't stop for more than 10 minutes at a time when i have a long way to go.  oh well.  anywho, this means they'll not get in til closer to 11pm now... 5 hours to kill... on the agenda: pay bills, make sweet tea, and eat lunch (yes i know it's after 6... doht)  i haven't seen anyone i know all day -- i think that's the problem... i might go pick up my plants, just so i can say hi to john instead of talking to myself til 11 -- ah, what a social life =P  later dudes

      so jessica's dad drove farther than we guessed today and she can't make the movie tomorrow since he'll be getting in several hours earlier than planned -- oops!  this means we'll take a rain check... so it goes.  on the other hand, not having to be up by 9am, i decided to go ahead and finish posting all the trip pictures i planned to post... all 79 ones i've posted from the last 2 weeks are online now... same link as last post...  really, now, 3am, i should get some sleep or i'll be noctural this weekend and my guests won't be!  doht!  night! =P

      i've been up for over 18 hours now... i guess that's what happens when you're used to being up late but started the day off with people who are used to being awake just hours after you *usually* go to sleep!  had fun last night in pittsburgh with my aunt, uncle, and cousins... my pittsburgh cousins are 12 and 13... the 13 year old is a foster kid who's in process of being adopted; she's been with them for going on 2 years now, whereas the 12 year old is related to me by blood... the difference between the two is sooo funny... danelle (foster cousin) has had such a bizarre past before she came to live with them, and is so flirty; whereas rachel (other cousin) is so laid back, calm, straightforward, and just complete opposite of danelle!  apparently one of danelle's friends at school told her she should watch the little mermaid because "the preist gets horny during the wedding"... danelle brought this up as soon as we all got home from dinner last night and it made for hilarious discussion later on while my aunt tried to figure out what to do with her... who knows  this morning they all got up around 6, so that's how long i've been running... was on the road from 9:30am til 3:30pm, and have been unpacking, doing laundry, and catching up on email since.  tomorrow will be fun -- jessica's coming up from philly so we can see "mean girls" and then do lunch... after she goes home to meet up with her dad (a tree destroyed her car in the storms last weekend, so he's bringing her her mom's car to replace the old one), i get to clean up around here before dave beagley and his friend (also a dave) get here... but that'll be late -- chicago to jersey all in one day is a looong haul!  done rambling, really.  if you're interested, photos from the trip are at  http://www.eden.rutgers.edu/~lpudwell/photoalbum.html  ... i've gotten about halfway through my visit to roommate's place and i'll finish at some point in the next week when i'm not falling asleep at the computer =P  night y'all!

      the final post from the road --  tonight i was introduced to the ohio wonder that is BW3-s, aka buffalo wild wings... quality food but talk about sensory overload... besides regular dinner time, there's a bar, a karaoke deal going on, tvs tuned to like 42 different channels around the room, and trivia (you can request a keypad or whatever to compete against other patrons... it's on still more tv screens around the room... multiple choice random factoids... it was lots of fun.  after that, alliswan, me, and her friend teresa went back to grounds for thought and played trivial pursuit for forever... only it was the 1981 release of the game so it was waaaay before our time... later teresa's husband guy met up with us all and we came back to alliswan's place and had ice cream/mudslides with her roommate lindsay, until now... 1am and time for sleep!  so yeah, it's been yet another quality visit. =)  now, two more days on the road and i'm home in jersey for a bit -- woohah =P

      it's been a good trip -- really it has... too bad it's almost over...  this morning alliswan made us french toast for breakfast and then we were off... first on a tour of her school (bowling green state university), then to panera for lunch (yay portabello and mozarella sandwiches!) and then to other fun.  immediately after lunch we went to "grounds for thought", a local coffee shop/used book store she keeps telling me about... i had a stellar latte, we played a game of chess, and then attacked the books... got a cheap copy of _a mathematician's apology_ finally, and also a book about the physics of christmas -- e.g. talks about celestial candidates for what was the star of bethlehem (i scanned the chapter... apparently jupiter saturn and one other planet would have converges from earth's point of view and a comet came through the same area of the sky then too... kinda cool) and the physics of what would be necessary for reindeer to fly =P  after grounds for thought, which again, was an extremely quality place, we drove up north to maumee, OH (suburb of toledo) to see a movie... i had seen "13 going on 30" before, but alliswan hadn't and i liked it so much the 1st time i was more than willing to see it again. =P  after the movie we enjoyed the theater arcade for a bit... pinball, racecar games, and air hockey later, we're back in good old bowling green... dropped off my film between valpo and today to pick up on our way to dinner and then getting together with some of alliswan's other friends here later... all in all, a quality day. =)  for those of you trying to keep track of my whereabouts, after today, i'll have brunch with alliswan tomorrow, then drive to my aunt's place in pittsburgh tomorrow afternoon... wednesday i drive pittsburgh to jersey and then i get to orchestrate fun while relatively staying put for a bit... it's been a party. =)  later dudes =P

      greetings from ohio (again!) =P  today was spiffy... lots of people and lots of fun.  last night, tammy, marcus, and i drove out on the county roads to look at the stars... i want to steal part of backroads indiana and take it back to jersey with me -- we could see sooooo many more stars than i can being between NYC and philly!  after that we watched bend it like beckham and crashed a little after 1am... not being able to sleep more than 6 hours in one shot anymore i was awake a little after 7, but waited til 8:30 to get ready... a quick breakfast and some chatting later, i was on my way 45 minutes around to the other end of indy to meet up with heather miller!  heather goes to a huge non-denominational church south of indy... i'd guess there were at least 500 people there and we were at one of just FOUR services... i liked it a lot but will also be happy to see my friends at good shepherd next week too =P  after church we had a long lunch and a really good chat... it was nice to see her for a bit even though it was a quick visit.  after paying $2.13 (choke!) for gas (the cheapest grade), and 4 hours of driving in crazy rain later, i'm at alliswan's place =)  it's still raining, so we spent the night in... dished out the couple $$ to rent "win a date with tad hamilton" and had fun laughing at the transparent characters =) it's good to be here. =)  hopefully tomorrow the weather will be nicer!  tomorrow's alliswan's birthday, but if you're in ohio then shhhh, because you're not supposed to know! ;-)  later dudes! =P

      so i'm in indiana for the 3rd time this trip!  staying with tammy and marcus (tammy as in math/cs buddy from valpo, and marcus is her husband... i was a bridesmaid in their wedding last may) just NW of indy.  last night i was indoctrinated -- saw wayne's world 1 and 2 with marcus (tammy was at work during the 1st one, and tammy fell asleep partway through the 2nd)... inbetween we had pizza and marcus's sister jenette was over with her two kids (ages 2 and 13 months)... it was a fun evening.  today, after making a mess making pancakes with tammy we went to the indy children's museum (5 floors of fun including a planetarium)... apparently the world's largest children's museum... i got trapped in a racecar (ask for details another time)... and greatly enjoyed the planetarium shows and had lots of fun with everything else too -- it was really well put together, and a party and a half =)  we stayed at the museum til it closed at 5 then headed into downtown to the soldiers and sailors monument in the center of the city... paid the $1 to get to the top and take pictures of the city from up high... then wandered circle center mall for a bit.  now, we're back at marcus and tammy's place (cute farmhouse they're renting with cows in the backyard =P) for dinner... later will be stargazing and mooooovie. =) (bend it like beckham since tammy's never seen it... i bought the soundtrack today and am majorly excited about it =P)  the plot after tonight? i meet heather miller for church in the AM (45 minute drive... tammy and marcus are NW of town, heather's church is S of town), have lunch with her, then drive 5 hours NE to bowling green, OH to hang out with alliswan for her birthday (monday) -- excited about seeing both of them as well!  at any rate, that's the plot... an excellent saturday to all y'all... be parties! =)

      here it is 12:32am (at least if you're in my time zone :-P), everyone else who actually belongs in this house is in bed and asleep, and here sits lara in the dark, typing away at the computer...   actually i have good reason for this... i've been on the road a week and roommate offered that i do my laundry for free while i'm here, so i started stuff up and i'm waiting for the dryer to finish up... blah.  anyhow, so i heard roommate preach tonight... since she's not ordained yet, she led the whole service except communion, then a visiting pastor from another denomination (united church of christ, which is in full communion with elca (roommate's kind of lutheran)) visited and led that part... only, if you're familiar with lutheran liturgy at all, he completely skipped the proper preface and recited the sanctus instead when the congregation normally sings that in response... he also held a card with the words of institution written on them so that when he actually picked up the bread and the chalice, he was one hand short and did strange things with them... it all worked out and he was really nice, but it was kinda amusing too.  while i'm on this church terms kick, saw a "what theologian are you?" quiz in another friend's blog who's in seminary (i.e. pastor school) like roommate is... here's my results:        "We reject the false doctrine that the church could have permission to hand over the form  of its message and of its order to whatever it itself might wish or to the vicissitudes of the  prevailing ideological and political convictions of the day."         You are Karl Barth!  You like your freedom, and are pretty stubborn against authority! You don't  care much for other people's opinions either. You can come up with your own fun, and  often enough you have too much fun. You are pretty popular because you let people have their  way, even when you have things figured out better than them.          urlLink What theologian are you?   A creation of  urlLink Henderson    the "You don't care much for other people's opinions either" i beg to disagree with, but the rest i thought was amusing. =P  so how about getting done with laundry and getting some sleep, eh?  p.s. "how to deal" gets 6/10 on the lara movie rating scale... "love actually" is for tomorrow morning.  night dudes. =P

      the rain held off -- now, i hope it pours so as to clean all the bird doo off my car from where it was parked last night!  i saw an 11 month old elephant today and it was exceedingly cute =)  so movies last night: shrek 2 (in theater), and cheaper by the dozen (rented)...  the plan tonight?  kristin's church has thursday night services in the summer for people who travel on weekends... she's preaching... we leave in an hour... afterwards, pizza time and watching the movies we rented when we returned last night's choice: "how to deal" and "love actually"... neither of us have seen either of them.  yay for fun downtime.  back to indiana tomorrow.  later dudes! =P

      you think while you're in college you can't wait to be done,.... and yeah, it's excellent to be done with things... but like last may, when i left, it was exciting to move on elsewhere in my life, i was ready for something new, and thought oh, i won't be back there for at least another year, probably more... now look at me... this is my 3rd time back in the past year.  it's good to be back.  strange becuase it's another turnover time... most of the friends i had left were seniors this year and the few who aren't will only be around for one more year...  changes: the new library they started last fall is nearly finished and they're giving tours the communications building is doubling in size or something... what used to be greenspace is now filling up with building... the new entrance of the major highway through town (u.s. 30) is opened now,... the math building's gotten a complete face lift... all in all, it's different every time  nonetheless, people changes and campus changes aside, coming back is still coming home in a sense.  i don't see my friends here regularly anymore, but when i do see them, it's stepping back into "family" -- i *belong* here.  anyhow, i'm done being all sentimental or whatever i'm being... exciting events in the last 24 hours?  the concert at heather's church was the touring choir from Africa University (in Zimbabwe)... dude, they could really sing and dance... the students in the choir (15 out of 115 are on tour for the summer in the states) were so excited that last night was the first stop where they got to meet american *college students* instead of just adults and small children... people their own age... they wanted pictures with us and to exchange emails... not only did we thoroughly enjoy the concert, we had lots of fun chatting with the choir members after!  after concert, adam hughes found us and he, heather, and i went to broadway and had planets (mars, neptune, and pluto to be specific)... if you don't know what planets are you're either (a) not from valpo or (b) haven't heard me babble enough about valpo yet =P  after that we went to visit the rock and take silly pictures with it (yes, at like midnight... i hope they turn out well, it was fun)  had a lazy AM, and dude i'm glad i'm staying with a friend... it was so hot when i left jersey that i only packed summer clothes, only it got down to 40 last night and is still just high 50s today, and thankfully neighborest heather is lending me sweatshirts for while i'm here!!!  had lunch with laura johnson and her fiance chris (they got engaged like a year ago, and this was the first i met him!)  yay applebees... we had fun...  now, going to wander campus and probably call a rutgers friend or two -- analysis grades are posted, and dr. goodman wasn't afraid to give Cs =(  i got a C+... which is not good and means i can't get a C next semester or i'm in trouble... oops.  time for a walk, to enjoy the beautiful weather now that the sun's out, and to talk get my analysis final angst out of my system... and then back to enjoying my friends. =)  later dudes.

      feels more like a year  went to sleep at 1am then... 6am: woke up, got my act together 6:45am: left intent on getting to starbucks to get frappuccinos for both me and leigh 7:30am: frappuccinos in hand, picked up leigh at her house, helped her pack my trunk full of her luggage, drove her to the airport 9am: arrived back at my place, after driving to newark and back 9-9:30am: actually got my act together for the day (the first time was mostly getting my eyes open and my arms and legs convinced they could move before 9... this time was for real =P 9:30am-11am: did laundry, did dishes, organized my life, balanced my checkbook, etc. 11am-noon: played chauffer for eric (and his friend misty who was visiting) so eric could mail some stuff home, run by the bank, etc. being without a car as he is noon-1pm: played phone tag/etc. with scott 1-3pm: had a sushi party at my house (memphis jenny had sent me a startup kit for making my own sushi... scott, ben, and vicki came over and helped with the endeavor (highlight of the afternoon for all was scott taking a shower with my punching bag -- don't ask) 3-3:45pm: cleaned up the sushi party 3:45-5pm: helped eric finish packing up his apartment, moved everything that his aunt hadn't taken to philly on sunday to my car 5pm-5:45pm: moved half of the stuff we had just put in my car into my place (to top off all this moving stuff it's been in the mid-high 80s all day, my room isn't air conditioned, and amanda refuses to turn on a/c in the rest of the apartment) 6-6:30pm: drove eric to newark airport, both of us singing billy joel songs the whole way and chatting quite a bit 6:30-7pm: drove back to my place 7-7:30pm: sorted through all eric's stuff to decide where to store it for the summer 7:30-8:30pm: waited in the most stupidly long lines ever at walmart to pay for lots of travel-size toiletries 8:30-9pm: other misc. errands 9-11pm: packing... ate the leftover sushi rice for dinner  now, finally, i think i'm about ready to crash... i at least have clothes, maps, and film figured out... the rest i can make up for on the fly if necessary... i hope.  so excited to see people... i saw roommate and alliswan both just 2 months ago, but they both visited when i was swamped with work; even if it's just for a day each, it'll be fantastic to get to visit without being incredibly stressed out at the same time =)... i saw most of the valpo people i'll see just back in january, but i'm excited to cheer for the graduating ones (and of course to see the non-graduating ones too =P)-- it'll just be an exciting time to be on campus, albeit a little bittersweet -- last time i was there for graduation, it was mine, and nicole was there too; i have a feeling those memories will be around a bit too.... haven't really visited with tammy or heather schaefer in person since last may, so it'll be extremely good to get some quality one-on-one visit time with both of them too =)... haven't seen memphis jenny since christmas, it'll be cool to see her corner of the world now... saw heather miller at the funeral in sept., but not really visited with her in person since then; from the bits i've heard from her in the last few weeks, this year's been really good for her academically and deciding what to do with her life-wise, so it'll be great to see her and chat a bit on what all she's up to... also, haven't seen jenny lemahieu in 2.5 years -- since she left for haiti with the peace coprs; now that she's back, we have a standing date to go chat at the dunes at some point over the weekend and discuss the finer points of life, the universe, and everything -- that'll be really good too. =)  yeah, in summary... it's gonna be a lot of driving (good thing i like that), and also just a really good time to catch up with people for a bit... it'll be great, all around. =)  now, to finish off my apple juice and get me some sleep.  night y'all! =)

      dude, if you think just because i'm done with classes life calms down... nope... last night i was up til 1am doing various "sorting out my life" type things... had a hard time falling asleep and was up again at 6am this morning (45 minutes before my alarm went off) so i could take leigh to the airport to catch her flight home.  i think partly when things are not following the usual schedule (e.g. two of my best friends here leaving today... the others leaving while i'm gone later in the week, me taking off tomorrow for 2 weeks and i haven't packed yet, etc.) my brain gets so excited at travel or so "oh my goodness i'm going to miss leigh/eric/scott/whoever" that it keeps going when it should be letting me sleep... oh well... tomorrow night i'll be on the road and ready to actually crash at night... i hope =P  in the meantime, it's hot outside... the drive to newark with leigh was nice... we picked up starbucks frappuccinos for the drive, sang along with the brother bear soundtrack, and the turnpike was moving along quickly... her plane takes off in like 2 minutes... meanwhile i'm doing laundry, figuring out exactly how one makes homemade sushi (for later this afternoon), should be packing, and need to take eric to run some errands in about an hour... joy oh joy. =P  in summary: no, things have not calmed down, i'm just as busy but with different things =P  oh, and here's your fun link of the day:  http://www.jobpredictor.com/index.asp     (i saw it in a friend's away message this morning... his name's neil... if you type it in you'll see why he didn't like the website... on the other hand, it says that my ideal job is being a "superhero", so yay for me =P ...and it says my brother (ryan)'s ideal job is a garden gnome, so that's 2 for 2, eh? =P let me know what it tells you =P)  later dudes =P

      several points of interest =P  (1) first off, unless you're completely thick in the head, i gave the blog a new look -- i like it, and if you don't, it's not your blog, so deal... if you do like it, enjoy! =P  (2) i'm officially a first-year-of-math-grad-school survivor!!!  today was rough though... i decided i like early morning finals much better than late afternoon ones... analysis was 4-7pm today and that gave me the 7 hours i was awake pre-exam to worry myself sick about a test i'm guessing i got a 25% on anyhow (it can't be good when you give up halfway through and start writing haikus in the margin about why you hate the class just to *look* busy because you have no good ideas about the problems themselves... i spent the last 20 minutes erasing my angst-filled poetry too =P)  (3) tomorrow shall be interesting... i'm not good with quick transitions and the next day and a half is definitely exactly that... i'm picking up leigh at 7:30 (AM) to drive her to newark to catch her flight home... doing laundry, etc. here, and getting ready for my trip... helping eric with some last minute errands of his own... making homemade sushi with the people... then driving eric to the airport to catch his flight home... (both eric and leigh told me they only *needed* rides to the train station, but i insisted i was willing to drive them the whole way so that i could actually talk to each of them before they leave... like i said... not good with quick transitions!) then, i gotta get myself in gear to get outta town myself... when i return, like everyone except ben will be gone for a bit... sadness.  (4) nonetheless, happy summer... road trip #1 begins in something like 36 hours =)

      in 24 hours i'll be the happiest lara ever... possibly in 22 or 23... in the meantime, analysis is sucking the life out of me... highly unfortunate.  i just want to get at least 50% on the exam so i can keep a B... i don't have a chance at an A anyhow. 50% doesn't sound like much, but my hard-earned midterm grade was a 55... it'll be close.  in other news, blogspot (the site this blog is hosted by) redid its pages today... i like the new look, but i have to pay attention to where i click when i go to post now since it's all different... doht.  back to analysis... oh the joy of hilbert spaces and fourier transforms.  wish me luck!

      it's been a fun one to be sure.  woke up and called friends to avoid studying, played minesweeper to avoid studying, wrote emails to avoid studying... then talked to rooommate for awhile she she made me promise to study for 2 hours... so i more or less did... then got back to being trouble.  drama #1: studying this afternoon in my room (which shares a wall with the bathroom)... amanda went in the bathroom to do whatever and started screaming and cursing for a couple minutes... she quickly got ready, and left for about 15 minutes, and when she came back she asked me the following ~~~~ amanda: hey, have you been in the woods lately? me: um, no, here, and campus, and that's about it amanda: because i found a tick in the bathroom earlier!  it was sooo gross! i've been in the woods, but i did a tick check, so i don't think it was me. ~~~~ ok... whatever... pretty sure of our two alibis it was not me... just had never seen someone freak out to such an extent over that before... =P  drama #2: (the only drama there was supposed to be!) eric, colleen, scott, leigh, john, and me had tickets to see the play "hms pinafore" tonight at the local playhouse... everyone but eric went out to dinner first, which was fun, and then we picked up eric and headed over to the play... it was fun... we all sat together for the first half, then eric spotted some unused seats in the next balcony down and wanted to move and everyone else felt too guilty to use seats besides the ones on their tickets, so it was just eric and me for the second half... if you've never heard of it before it's an opera satire... it's on a boat and the captain's about to have the commander of the british navy come aboard and marry his daughter, but the daughter's in love with one of the ship's crew instead... meanwhile the captain is in love with a tradeswoman who sells food to the ship, but both matches are crossing social strata so they're all screwed.  when the navy commander comes aboard he brings along his 8 sisters, cousins, and aunts and there's lots of dancing jigs and corny songs... in the end it turns out the captain and the sailor that the captain's daughter loves were switched at birth so really everyone's in love with someone on their own social level and there's a double wedding and the world goes on happily ever after.  in the meantime lots of laughs and jigs... it was fun to see.  drama #3: everyone else went straight home after the play except me and leigh, who both wanted some starbucks... as the whole crew of us was leaving though, a fire engine crossed in front of us... 20 minutes later when leigh and i got to the parking garage where my car was, that's where the fire engine was, and the firemen were all flooding down to the basement level of the garage... good thing my car was parked on the roof ;-)    all this is to say, for starting off slowly, it's been an eventful evening.  now, for some un-drama... or mental drama,... or something... leigh borrowed my favorite book ever ( magnus  by sigmund brouwer) last month, and now i'm reading hers ( arrows of the queen  by mercedes lackey)... i'm about a third of the way through at present... easy to read fantasy novel... it's fun.  reading myself to sleep... night y'all! =P

      that's the theme lately... last weekend was "cats", tonight was "signs of love", which i'm confident none of you have heard of before =P  why?  because it's a play my pastor wrote for part of his Ph.D. 10 years ago, and it was fun.  tonight was the 3rd performance of 4 times that all the local churches were invited to and i'm glad i went.  basically he took the gospel of john and made it into a modern day parable... jesus and the disciples were instead a controversial rock band in L.A., judas was their money hungry manager... the feeding of the 5,000 with bread and fish became the feeding of the concert audience with chicken and biscuits; lazarus being raised from the dead happened in the middle of a hospital autopsy, etc.... full of puns and funniness, but also an interesting spin on things too, and not quite as cut and dry as the general scene descriptions i just wrote sound....  both pastor and his son (who helped produce the staging of it) acted in it, and both steve and scott (the two brothers in the family i'm always visiting) were in it too.  all in all, a thought-provoking and enjoyable evening... like i said, really glad i went. =)  plus, of course, since i was hanging out with church people for the evening i got lots of hugs -- that doesn't happen in math departments =P so yay for people too.  anyhow, now i'm just being a putz for the evening... night all.

      so i spent my evening not with the math people for one more friday night, but at church, half an hour away... (more on that later)... just a weird happening on the way home... so i'm driving back to my place and my phone rings... the caller ID said "jessica warnier" (one of my valpo friends, but the last i've called her/she's called me instead of just IM was when i was over to valpo in january) i answer, kinda surprised with a "hi!, how are you?" and instead get "hi lara?  this is grandm- oh wait... yeah, grandma... how are you?  you're on the same time zone as chicago over there aren't you?  i didn't wake you up?"  dude... just fine, and had to go over the "wrong g-ma there's a time change, but i'm always up way later than this so you're fine", but my phone's never screwed up the caller ID feature before...  whatever.  more on what i was up to tonight later =P

      so i have a part time job for summer now... i guess it is partly who you know... my boss from last summer said i could work long distance for june for the same pay rate i made last summer for somewhere around 10-15 hours per week.  it's not full time, but it's something, ya know?  and for me only being in one place for 4 weeks of the summer, i don't know how much more i'd find anyhow.  so yay for that.  the end.

      well, the didgeridoo concert went off spectacularly... by the time i got to campus and found eric and we got to the math building it was nearly 11pm... within 5 minutes of when we started playing the didgeridoos from the ground floor level of the main 7 story staircase (the echoes/vibrations are awesome and make them really loud) i got a call on my cell from someone asking me if all the noise was me and eric or if the building was going to fall down =P  shortly thereafter paul ellis and colleen appeared at the 7th floor railing laughing at us... we met them halfway up the stairs and played with the didges for a bit... there were people studying in the graduate lounge (on the 7th floor) and we tormented them for a little too... by the time we made it all the way back downstairs and played in the courtyard for a little, it was midnight.  made it hope and have been cleaning out email, and saving old ones to disk... check out this one from my 6th grade teacher:  "Lara,  Summer plans sound wonderful!  I envy your energy.  Enjoy life while you are free and unattached.  Some day you will look back and amaze yourself at your guts and worldly travels.  There are a whole bunch of people who wish they had taken your opportunities before settling down with a job and family.  God bless.   Mrs. Winter"  i read that a couple days ago and thought it was a nice cherry message, and then i got all philosophical. question: when i'm older, will i really be amazed at my "guts and worldly travels" or is my lifestyle just the 20-something student lifestyle that's been made possible as technology/travel options improve... i don't think of myself as gutsy, but whatever... discuss.  i have no idea why i'm up at quarter to 4am... maybe it's time for sleep... night! =P

      dude, so i just spent another 2 hours in front of the TV watching more friends... i didn't know that the first hour was just going to be old scenes, but it was fun... the last show though, ended each plotline how i thought it should end... phoebe's stuff has been settled for awhile; but her bursting out in song periodically was fun... joey was joey; the whole birds in the foosball table issue was funny; but it was interesting that no reference was made to him moving to hollywood for the new series; instead they just talked about him staying on where he was; i totally did NOT see the twins coming for chandler and monica, so they was high drama AND a surprise... and you knew ross and rachel had to end up together; it was a little drawn out and then seemed a little too peachy, but it ended how you wanted it to end for everyone to be happy... at any rate, no new episodes, and between grandma pudwell and me, all the old ones are just about memorized =P  otherwise, my day was productive... studied algebra last night from 11pm to 2am... slept til 7am, woke up, studied some more... took the exam from 9-11... came to my place with eric and plotted with my atlas about july... went to shoprite to recycle lots of bags, went to walmart to talk about the broken part of my telescope and got things arranged so the telescope manufacturer (at walmart's prompting) will pay for the broken part to be shipped (UPS is coming by tomorrow or monday to pick it up) and fix it... then went to blockbuster... leigh, colleen, and eric all had wanted to see "master and commander" for a bit, so eric and i rented it, and we all went to leigh's to watch... later, a few more errands, and it was already 7pm... i went home for dinner and friends, eric went home to work on his number theory final... dude, i'm so skilled at wasting away time!  at any rate... here's the extra fun... eric and me are meeting up in 20 minutes to go play both our didgeridoos in the 7 story stairwell of the math building... it shall be highly entertaining. =P  back later dudes =)

      no more algebra... just down to analysis and then i'm a 2nd year... yay =)  this morning's exam was alright... it really wouldn't have helped me to study lots more last night b/c the main question i had no idea on was over something i didn't plan to study last night either... he said answer everything and he'd just count our best 75%, so i think it worked out alright.  since then, eric and me have been putzing around... we went to my house to check out my new didgeridoo, then looked at maps and got excited about the july trip, then to shoprite to recycle grocery bags, then to walmart to ask them about the broken azimuth drive on my telescope, then to blockbuster... eric's currently making us sandwiches, then an afternoon of watching "master and commander" with colleen and leigh, and doing other misc errands (burning CDs i want before eric leaves for home on tuesday... packing up the broken part of my telescope for UPS to pick up and send to the dealer tomorrow, etc.  joy.  the end.  yay for being down to just one class and having a time to not start studying for the last one just yet. ;-)  later dudes!

      boy, do i have it mastered or what?!?  algebra final in 10 hours... too bad i've managed to procrastinate for the past 10 hours... ooops 1-2pm... convinced eric that he didn't want to study yet and we should run errands 2-3pm... convinced eric that we should have one last starbucks run of the semester, and chatted about life the universe and everything over frappuccinos 3-4pm... arrived home to discover my new didgeridoo... was compelled to play it, and call friends up to play "name that sound" over the phone =) 4-5pm... made strawberry kiwi jello and a big pitcher of sweet tea... played minesweeper inbetween 5-6pm... pretended to study algebra, but ran around frequently to play with my koosh ball and write emails... chatted with my brother for half an hour 6-7pm... got way excited about the thunderstorm that passed through and rained like an inch of rain in 15 minutes, watched the clouds and hoped for a rainbow 7-8pm... dinner and more general time-wasting 8-9pm... actually studied for the better part of an hour (but shhh don't tell) 9-11pm... watched the dateline special about the end of "friends", which i enjoyed a bunch, the interviews were entertaining and the outtakes were highly amusing  so yeah, that's how to kill an afternoon lara-style... maybe i should think about studying a bit more than 45 minutes before 9am gets here... too bad my brain's quit for the semester when in theory it has 5 days to go... oops.

      lara = happiest proud new didgeridoo owner in the world  recall eric has a didgeridoo i like to play with that a friend of his made... after much discussion (eric talks to me, then eric talks to his friend) over the past 8 months, a month ago i sent a check to cover postage and give the guy some money for handmaking the thing, and it (my new handcarved by eric's MN friend didgeridoo) came in the mail today -- i'm ecstatic! =)

      so i just got done with a luncheon with some math department benefactors... while we were waiting for the donors to show up, colleen and eric  sat me down and explained last night after i was asleep paul (the crazy 2nd year in charge of pizza seminar) found them (most all the usual 1st year crew) in the graduate lounge and made a list of all the 1st years to decide who should be in charge of pizza seminar next year....  they apparently decided on me since sam, ian, and me were top picks and sam is already in charge of computer input and the graduate logic seminar, and ian has a small child to interfere... they also told paul i'd probably outright refuse to order pizza (which leigh volunteered to do if i don't make her do a talk) and that he should by no means just come up to me and say "hey lara pudwell, you're the next pizza coordinator" or i'd kill him (they know me well!)  anyhow, apparently it's my new job and they decided personality wise i'd be good at convnicing people to do it because i generally don't take no for an answer: either i'm persistent or i cry, both of which makes people do stuff.  never knew being as talkative as i am and as prone to crying as i am could add up to a good thing...  anyhow, i told paul to give me a few days to reconcile with being in charge of the seminar and then it would probably be ok... in the meantime to leave me alone about it. =P  the end.

      i have no idea why i'm awake... especially when i've been up for like 14 hours now on just 4 hours of sleep... nonetheless, in finals/reflection/wrap-up mode.... last entry of the night, then really, i'm going to sleep =P, promise...  top 10 things i've learned this semester ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  (10) various mathematical facts (e.g. tensors of characters of irreducible representations, 3 points if you can correctly define every word in that phrase =P)  (9) you can absolutely love a subject, but learn absolutely nothing about it on account of a bad prof (algebra)  (8) you can work your head off, but if you started out behind, you'll most likely be behind the whole semester (taking lie groups with colleen and leigh and none of us knowing a thing about manifolds... oops!)  (7) you can know exactly what's going on, still work for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and still have nothing to show for it (graph theory homework)  (6) sometimes you just have to admit you have no idea what's going on and beg for smarter friends to spoonfeed you ideas (analysis), rephrased: grad school leaves no room for pride  (5) grades don't mean a thing -- seriously  (4) coming to terms with #5 takes a bit of work, but once you do, it makes life much simpler.  (3) when stressed, i cry easily... and mostly on account of yawning, laughing, or thinking hard... summary: i've learned i have hyper-active tear ducts, and they're a great source of entertainment, but also make people worry about me more than necessary  (2) your subconscious keeps dealing with stress and manifesting itself in weird ways long after you think you're consciously done dealing with stuff  (1) good friends are more valuable than just about anything else on the planet, and i have some most excellent ones =)  the end.

      lkp 42 42 42: so you said the other day "i've learned the most in analysis out of all my classes this semester, but i'm not going to let that fool me into thinking i'd be remotely good at it"  however, one repeated remark to me complaining about graph theory is "well it's a hard class and a hard prof; that doesn't necessarily mean you're bad at it"  food for thought: how do you determine the line between "this class is hard/challenging" and "really, this i'm not cut out for this"... could they really be rationalizing the same problem different ways based on prior disposition????  remark: this isn't to complain "lara's dumb"... more of a philosophical issue  Galois1105: well the first criterion for discriminating the two that comes to mind is this:  If I went back to an undergraduate analysis course, I'd probably understand things a little better, but I don't know that I'd be all that much better at solving problems.  If you went back to an undergraduate graph theory course, I think you'd be able to solve a lot more with the experience that you've gained this semester.  discuss.

      i'm tired   i ended up not going to sleep until 6am, woke up at 10 to turn in graph theory (which was badly done at that), decided i didn't want to drive all the way to campus, spent 20 minutes figuring out how to convert the .dvi file of my answers into a .pdf, emailed it to the prof, and tried to go back to sleep... *try* being the operative word... i couldn't fall back asleep with the sun so bright out my window, so i've been running on 4 hours of sleep...   ran lots of errands, then showed up on campus... i didn't think i was in a bad mood until i started to work on the takehome part of the algebra final and couldn't think straight to solve anything... i was so tired that even yawning made me cry... eric helped me for about 20 minutes and then leigh invited me to go to barnes and noble with her for a couple hours, so that's what i did...   leigh wins super-hero of the day award... i now have most of the take-home part of algebra done mostly because she sat down in a corner of the bookstore with me and some starbucks, and let me work and just occasionally asked "so where are you now? tell me what you're thinking" and kept me on task... i like leigh a lot... if you're in a great mood, she's all abouy having fun... if you're in a crummy mood, you couldn't ask for someone more consistently patient and helpful to interact with. the end.   now, i'm home... writing up stuff, watching the season finale of scrubs, and then at long last... sleep!

      $\mathbb{E}[lara's anticipated graph theory grade]  0$  (you might be a math person if you know what on earth i typed that in...) (you might have been an analysis student at some point if you can make sense of what it says!)  i solved absolutely no new problems today despite working most of the time since i woke up at 10... why do i even bother staying up this late?  for all epsilon > 0, my enthusiasm for the rest of this semester is definitely bounded above by epsilon, and my anticipation to move on to summer break is bounded below by 1/epsilon.  1 more week til freedom...

      i'm a mean person today... really.  i was way excited about being done with analysis lectures for forever and my away message proclaimed that last night.  the younger brother of one of my friends talks to me on IM sometimes and told me "oh that can't be right... analysis rocks!" and i told him he's doesn't know enough to have a valid comment.  (1) mean of me (2) why did his comment get to me?  worked on graph theory with sarah (2nd year) for awhile between classes today and didn't get anywhere new... haven't worked on it on the computer yet tonight (just on paper) and have no idea on the last 3/9 problems.  i'm really past the point of caring... at all.... though, so whatever.  i'm just ready for this semester to be done -- 15 hours and graph theory will be done, 3 days and algebra will be done, a week and it's all done... joy.  on a happier note, eric IMed me earlier and was like "dude, wanna make pizza for dinner?"  45 minutes later i showed up, and we started making the pizza to discover he had no cheese... a grocery store trip and other such fun later we had our artichoke, mushroom, and olive pizza, some quality salad, and juice, and it was durn spiffy.  quote: me (to myself, in a different room from eric): la la la eric: dude, what was that noise? me: you don't recognize it? eric: well, i'd say it was you singing in a muppet voice, but how often does that happen? me: (laughing) good job! eric: seriously it's like "hi! kermit the frog here!"  (btw, eric does a surprisingly good kermit voice impression! -- i laughed)  now, i'm working for a little then crashing... no class tomorrow -- yay for reading days!

      it's official -- i don't care anymore... seriously, i have no problem turning in completely made up answers to my profs, getting horrible grades, and just being done with things.  i've never had so much to do at once as i have had this weekend, and my brain is fried.  i learned lots of stuff this semester, just not quite what my profs wanted me to.  its been a recent revelation that grades are pretty insignificant in general (at least in terms of math grad school).  either you have a tough prof who gives mostly Bs, or an easy prof who gives mostly As.  as long as you turn in stuff, there's not a chance of getting a C because no prof can justify being the one who got you kicked out if you've been turning in your work and going to class and making some sort of an effort.  if i'm going to turn in hours worth of work and most likely get Bs all around anyhow, i might as well not agonize anymore, right?  right.... you know as soon as graph theory's done i'll be panicking over algebra, and after that over analysis... remind me of this entry when i do that.  i'm grumpy, tired, feeling dumb, and who knows what else.... at least i have a bowl of pistachio pudding. =)

      just a note to say, grabbing dinner off the "expires today/half price" pasta shelf at shoprite is a worthwhile expenditure.  while eric was waiting his turn in line at the deli (took 20 minutes) this afternoon, i was looking around, and found a bunch of fancy pasta things marked down from $4 to $2 because they had fresh vegetable/seafood/whatever stuff on top of them and will go bad eventually... i picked up a mushroom one and a seafood one (fettuccini pescatore seafood special).  they looked decent at the time, and now that i'm having the latter one for dinner, it was an extremely quality investment (& yes, my brain  is  completely fried.)  back to work

      the brother called... he's currently giving me a list of $$-making ideas for the summer  current list:  * sell my organs on the black market * sell all my possessions on ebay * sell flamingo insurance * ask everyone on my mass-email list to donate $20 to the "la endowment fund" * wander around public places talking my head off and get them to pay me to go away * panhandle * find a rich benefactor  thoughts?  while i'm thinking about it, eric did suggest yesterday that maybe if i had a bar mitzvah, i'd get enough money to cover bills... (obviously it was a joke... and even if it weren't i don't think converting to judaism for the month of june would convince the people who know me to give me money =P)  joy. now, really, i'm working.

      not really, but some people get to me... lately that would be ian (one of the other first years here... only he's nearer 30 years old and has a wife and a 2 year old daugher)... a couple weeks ago, he gave me a hard time about speaking up on behalf of most of the class about scheduling exams... since then he's been giving me minor headaches with his attitude/whatever too... like today, he told me he was all about working on graph theory this afternoon, so i showed up at the math building, and he (1) more or less dismissed my solution to one problem he was still working on, and kept going on it in silence, and (2) when i asked for a hint on one he'd already solved and i haven't talked to me like i was stupid and ended up being no help whatsoever... basically i spent 3 hours in the math building and accomplishing nothing... yuck... back to work, and getting over my curren ian-directed angst.  later dudes

      just finally finished with  the house on the strand  -- i actually started reading it in new hampshire over spring break when i was visiting marianne... that it takes me 2 months to finish a quality 300-page book says a lot for how hectic my life is, eh?  i've had nightmares the last two nights on account of people dying in the book and pictures still in my head when i try to go to sleep... figured if i finished off the last 5 chapters tonight, i wouldn't have to worry about it... the plot's done, but it left me with more questions than the average story... i suppose that's a sign of a good and intriguing plot.  at any rate, it's obscure, but i'd highly recommend it... all about being caught between two worlds and determining what's real,... once i got going, i was hooked.  for now, though, i gotta be up in like 6.5 or 7 hours... gotta separate the reality of wanting to think more about the book from the necessity of sleep and go with the latter... joy.  night y'all... for real this time =P

      dude, fun afternoon.  first, eric and me went to cash in our full sub club cards at subway (i.e. i got a free sandwich and just had to pay for my drink)  then, we picked up scott and colleen and saw cats and the local theater -- it was fun... i never had seen it before, the one in the subject line was my favorite song, but the whole thing was pretty impressive!  i'm tired, and have lots to do, and in general as anyone who knows me remotely well would attest to, if i'm laughing hard, i'm generally crying hard as well... when i'm tired and/or stressed, just about anything will set off the "laughing so hard i cry" so i was crying most of the evening... dude, i need to get some non-hyperactive tear glands or something... and of course, people just egg me on once i get going... before the show eric, colleen, and i were talking in the lobby and something funny had just been said when scott came back to join us, and when he commented "wow lara, i knew i could make you cry, but just me leaving you for 5 minutes is a new one", that kept me going for awhile more!  during intermission he also leaned over and asked me, "so give me your favorite 2-syllable word and i'll sing 'memory' for you", so we got "smelly, they're so awfully smelly", and "llama, when i see you i'll be riding a llama" and other crazy things.  eric gave me a hard time too... mostly making fun of my grammar as usual, when i asked at one point "so is this halftime" he gave me a hard time for saying halftime instead of intermission... at another point he laughed his head off at me that "most people say 'shhhh' when they mean, 'hey, don't repeat when i just said'... how you manage to think it means 'shhh, hey, i'm not going to answer your question' is beyond me"  anyhow, we all laughed, we all had fun, and now we're all back home -- and luckily safely at that... i don't know what was up with me... 3 times i tried to drive the wrong way down one-way streets this evening on the way to and from the play... eric started explaining about something in vegas while we were walking from my car to his dorm to look up some stuff about shows when i'll be there in july, and i started looking around while he was talking and he was like "dude, the tower i'm talking about is in nevada, NOT here!"... i'm sooo out of it!  so yeah, i'm tired, but good, and apparently highly entertaining and highly amused.  oh here's two more random facts... i have the only un-air-conditioned room in this apartment... eric and scott were sweating the whole time in the play and i was fine... i get home and i've been sweating since i walked in the door -- it's burning up in here... literally!  also, i lit a new candle last night (3 layers, all different kinds of coffee scented), and noticed tonight that the desk lamp i have on my bookshelf was apparently too close to it since now, instead of a half-sphere it's a half sphere with several plastic icicles (now rehardened) dripping off of it... funny that i didn't see/smell anything weird last night...  bother.  reading myself to sleep... night y'all!

      in the event that you buy your beer in bottles instead of cans, it's probably not wise to put a box of such beer on its side on the front of a shelf in your fridge... bottles are narrower at the top, and the bottom row of beers forms a "slide" for the top row to attack whoever opens the fridge next.  in my case, amanda bought the beer, did a bad job of stacking it in the fridge last night, and when i opened the fridge this morning to make some lunch, a bottle fell out, breaking on my foot, soaking me in beer just after i had gotten out of the shower, and drenched the kitchen... amanda was already gone for the day, so i had to (a) clean the cut on my foot, (b) look for and clean up shards of glass all over the floor of the kitchen (c) mop up a lot of beer,.... and the kitchen and me still reek of beer... i guess that's shower #2 of the day coming up... joy.

      (call home earlier) brother and poncho (our green-winged macaw) (in unison): hello? me: hi!  i heard poncho too, did he know it was me? (laughing) brother: no, i think the hello was to the walnut he's about to eat... he's going through a greeting his food before he eats it phase  duuuude  "josie and the pussycats" is on the WB right now... never seen it, was going to change channels, but the dude who plays turk in scrubs is in it, so i might just have to laugh at the stupidity for fun :-P  spiderman 2 came out today -- hopefuly seeing it later with ben  do dah.

      what a day  woke up with grand intentions of working hard on math all day, but really not so much  i solved one problem and then....  "black death" signed online and we chatted from like 3pm til 7:30pm... i did other things in the meantime... like watch tv, color in my coloring book,... but not math  around 7:30 we started playing chess online... game 1: lara has a queen and a king, BD had a king, but i got into stalemate instead of checkmate -- tie game... game 2: lara's losing pieces left and right about about ready to quit when i randomly got a rook in a fortunate position, 1 by 1 took out his major (non-pawn) pieces, and kicked butt...  this brings us to 9pm, when eric signed online to ask me car advice... i'd told him he should get an intrepid of an impala because i like those and so he went to a dodge dealer looking for an intrepid today and saw this:  http://www.lasvegaschapman.com/ChryslerJeep/results.asp?StockNumber=PP3181 ...  Galois1105: well there's a 2004 dodge neon with 10000 miles and list price of $11000 that i found lkp4242: ooh lkp4242: neons aren't bad lkp4242: if you like it go for it lkp4242: beagley drives one that's a few years old lkp4242: mostly it's a space thing Galois1105: and guess what..... it's blue:-) lkp4242: ooo!!!! lkp4242: this could be a sign :-) lkp4242: you should just call me dude Galois1105: okay Galois1105: one sec  re: above, the hilarious thing is, i'd told eric back in april that i've had a few random dreams about being on the roadtrip in july... nothing profound, just do dah do dah, we're riding in the car singing with a CD driving through desert or something or we're near the car at the grand canyon (which my mind's completely made up since i've never been there)... but every single time i've dreamt about being on the trip, the car is blue... note: the car in the above link is indeed BLUE  now for a non-car, non-internet thing... the whole time eric and me were on the phone just now, his sister (still in HS) was in the background showing him new high heels she got that light up with lights that look like fireworks or something and he's relaying her comments to me:  rachael (eric's sister): see, aren't they cool... does lara think they sound cool? eric: (repeats) me: um yeah, but you know what kind of shoes i wear right eric: yup, guy sandals or none rachael (in disbelief in the background): lara doesn't wear high heels??? how tall is she? eric: how tall ae you? me: 6 foot eric: she's 6 foot rachael: (in shock!) ooh (later... after eric and me talked cars more) eric: so rachael wants to know where you like to shop me: for what?  for books or for clothes? eric: it's rachael asking -- for clothes me: uuh duh, i don't like to shop eric: see, shelley, lara's doesn't like to shop... she's not a normal girl... she's kinda like... well, she's like me. (much laughter all around)  that's about as good a summary as it gets :-P  dinner time :-P

      several weeks ago, google rolled out its new g-mail, and quickly yahoo responded by increasing their standard 6M mailbox to 100M... having 5 active email addresses (rutgers general, rutgers math server, yahoo, excite, hotmail, each for a different purpose), i was curious what the other non-academic email sites would do... and now i have my answer  excite's had a blurb in huge letters for a about a week now "coming soon: your new 125M mailbox! and 10K attachments... coming in september"... geesh... 1.25 times yahoo size, even though they're probably the least popular of the trio (yahoo, hotmail, excite?), but yahoo gave me my upgrade right away... i gotta wait another 2 months for this one (don't get me wrong -- i like excite... i get absolutely no spam there, and they've upgraded quite a bit since i first got an account with them... they're just not an email "supergiant" like yahoo and hotmail)  hotmail sent an email to users this morning announcing that they'll start doing state of the art virus scans on attachements, allow you to send 10K attachments (like yahoo changed at their upgrade) and give you a 250M limit. (stay tuned for details in the next 2 weeks they say... how long will it take?  hmmmmm)  ok, seriously, when we've learned to cope with 6M (yahoo), 3M (excite) and with a mere 2M (hotmail) for so long, don't get me wrong, i appreciate the extra space, options -- no complaints... but does anyone find it highly amusing that they're each trying to come up with an insanely bigger number than the previous competitor who just rolled something out?  i've gotten good at managing my 3/6/2M inboxes... now having 125/100/250M?... dude...  more space is good -- this is just crazy =P especially when it feels like the bigger numbers are there to compensate for the fact that these other servers weren't prepared to make the upgrade as quickly and smoothly as yahoo did... hmmmm  that's my thought for the morning -- finishing the may/june "night sky" (astronomy magazine) issue, breakfast, and then getting to work for the day =P  the end.

      (1) woke up before noon (2) went to church and actually had 3 other math grad students come with me! (paul, sujith, and colleen) (3) grocery shopping (this is majorly exciting because i have a weird paranoia about going to the grocery store by myself, or once there about dealing with shopping carts -- a liter of egg drop soup for $1.50 makes me happy though :-) ) (4) finished reading  the millenium problems  (as if you can't tell by the previous entry (5) talked on the phone with heather miller for an hour (6) talked on the phone with eric for an hour (7) talked on the phone with roommate for half an hour (8) talked on the phone with jenny lemahieu for half an hour (first i'd talked to her since her heart surgery 4 weeks ago) (9) had my room shown off to prospective new tenant... dude... (10) talked on the phone with tammy for an hour  [by this point, my ear hurt from being attached to the cell for 4 hours straight more or less, but they were quite the quality chats :)]  tammy quote: "i don't know what to do around girly girls because really, i'm not one, and i completely don't understand... what's up with them?"  (11) dinner: egg drop soup, some sushi, and some raw mushrooms -- doesn't that sound great? (12) finished reading "the spy issue" of mental floss (back issue from mid-2002)  what's next on the list?  more fun reading of course!  astronomy magazine, this week's issue of time, other astronomy magazine, or  the science of God ... your guess is as good as mine =P  later dudes.

      just finished the latest book on my personal reading list ( the millenium problems  by keith devlin).  this calls for a book report of sorts :-)  enjoy, and feel informed, evn if it is just vaguely, at my summary of a summary of what hardcore math people are interested in these days =P  question: what are the millenium problems?  answer: back in 1900, david hilbert, mathematician extraordinaire, made a list of the top problems he'd like to see solved in the next century... all but one were solved.  in hilbert's spirit, the clay mathematics institute made a list of seven "millenium problems" which they presented in 2000 as the new hilbert's list of big important hard problems to solve.  the remaining hilbert problem is one of the seven, along with 6 other significant questions.  As a measure of recognition of how difficult these problems are CMI (clay math institute) has put a $1million bounty on a complete solution to each of these problems...   with how increasingly abstract and specialized research mathematics is, devlin's book is an overview of each of the problems for mathematicians who are not specialists in these areas as well as for ambitious non-mathematicians... his descriptions of the first 5 problems are accessible... of the last two, he even admits "these are really hard to put in simple terms... good luck with these last 30 pages, and don't feel bad if you give up"...   all that said, here's the list of the millenium problems, very simply what they're about (lara's even more simplified summary of devlin's summary), and why you should care (besides the fact that you know me (an aspiring mathematician) and probably others of my math friends and this is what we all care about :-P)  here goes:  (1)   the Riemann Hypothesis  :  in simple math terms: all zeros of the Riemann zeta function (other than the negative even integers) lie on the line Re(z) = 1/2 in the complex plane  in relatively non-math words: there's a particular equation number theory people are interested in, because if it does what they think it does, we know a lot about how the prime numbers are distributed  why do you care?  if this equation can be solved and the prime numbers do what mathematicians think they do, this affects the way internet security works (which is based on the idea that it's really hard to factor/predict insanely large prime numbers)  (2)   Yang-Mills Theory and the Mass Gap Hypothesis  :  in simple math terms: for any compact, simple, guage group, the quantum yang-mills equations in four-dimensional euclidean space have a solution that predicts a mass gap  in relatively non-math words: physics is looking for a grand unified theory of everything that accounts for the mechanics (which we witness day to day), quantum theory (what happens on a tiny scale inside atoms/etc.), and relativity (what happens on a giant cosmic scale)... physicists operate on many assumptions that according to all scientific evidence are indeed true... however, the math to support what modern physics is working in doesn't exist yet... mission: fill in the missing mathematics!  why do you care? solving the yang-mills equations would give the mathematical backing for some things physics knows and uses on a regular basis... being able to give the mathematics behind the mass gap hypothesis, would be significant for physicists as well though, explaning why the phenomenon that m=E/c^2 (related to E=mc^2) seems to imply you can get mass from pure energy... however there's a nonzero minimum energy level needed to produce such mass... solving the mass gap hypothesis would account for why this is so, which is currently a mystery.  (3)   P vs. NP  :  in simple math terms: can all problems that can be solved in nondeterministic polynomial (NP) time really be solved in polynomial (P) time?  in relatively non-math words: if there is a "P" time algorithm to solve a problem, no matter how much data you give it, a computer should be able to solve it in a non-ridiculous amount of time.  however, many problems that businesses need to solve or approximate from day to day (even scheduling workers/tasks optimally) are "NP" problems, meaning even just adding slightly more data/workers to sort makes the computer solving time go up ridiculously.  the idea of this problem is to determine if such "ridiculous to compute" problems really do have "P" time algorithm solutions that we just haven't found yet  why do you care?  if P=NP we know that algorithms exist to solve things more efficiently, and this is a good thing :-)... if not, then it's ridiculous to keep working on finding polynomial algorithms for some tasks because they don't exist (and for the record, the money's on the latter being true)... in a word, it's all about time management   (4)   the Navier-Stokes Equations  :  in simple math terms: the navier-stokes equations given initial conditions can be solved for all times t 0  in relatively non-math words: the navier-stokes equations describe how liquid moves in 3 dimensions.  however, no one can pinpoint how to solve them even though we know they work... in that respect, kinda like the issue with yang-mills above =P  why do you care?  if solved, navier-stokes would give immense insight into the dynamics fluid flow over surfaces -- a solution could result in better design of planes or boats... or in better understanding how blood moves inside us leading to new life-saving devices we don't know enough to make yet!  (5)   the Poincare conjecture  :  in simple math terms: can a 3-manifold have the loop shrinking property and NOT be equivalent to a 3-sphere?  in relatively non-math words: in studying topology, the above conjecture has been proven for 2 dimensions and for 4 and higher dimensions... 3 is the missing gap no one seems to fill in  why do you care?  if, as suspected, it turns out to be true, we finally fill in a long missing piece of the puzzle of topology... if for some weird reason it turns out to be false (although all the money's on it being true), then there are some really quirky things going on in the universe  (6)   the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture  :  in simple math terms: the existence of many solutions to a particular equation mod p (for many primes p) guarantees the original equation (not mod-anything) has infinitely many rational solutions  in relatively non-math words: in algebra you learned how to "solve" equations for x and y (e.g. x^2 + 5x -6 = 0... x = ?)... this is basically a question about solving more complicated equations where we just want to know answers where x and y are rational (can be written as fractions)  why do you care?  this problem has to do with elliptic curves... in the spirit of being as vague as possible, answering more questions about elliptic curves would have repurcussions in stuff anywhere from number theory to geometry to cryptography to the mathematics of data transmission... vague description, but useful :-P  (7)   the Hodge conjecture    in simple math terms: every harmonic differential form (of a certain type) on a non-singular projective algebraic variety is a rational combination of cohomology classes of algebraic cycles  in relatively non-math words: you learned at some point (i hope) that math equations can describe particular objects you can "see" (x^2 + y^2 = 25 for example describes a circle of radius 5)... an algebraic variety is the "object" described by a system of equations -- maybe you can visualize it maybe you can't... this conjecture guesses that a particular type of algebraic variety (call them H-objects) can all be built out of really simple building blocks, so to speak  why do you care?  this is after all the most complicated to explain of the 7... because it seems bizarre anyone could have intuition like this on something so abstract... i can't tell you what good application it would have, but if this turns out to be true it would say a lot about how amazing human intuition can really be :-)  if you're still reading, i'm impressed... don't you feel at least somewhat informed/slightly smart now?  to see the "real" versions of the 7 millenium problems, rather than my abstraction of an abstraction, go here:  http://www.claymath.org .  later dudes =P

      it's been an alright day.  did lots of errands, then scott and me worked at the new starbucks for several hours.  came home, ate dinner, read a little, setup my telescope finally since the motor came back repaired a couple weeks ago... talked to laura felch on IM for the first time in ages; i like talking to her; funny how some friends kinda slip in and out of the picture depending on what's going on... funny in an unforunate way... but the slipping back into the picture is a good thing =)  perfect stargazing weather tonight too, but for some reason, everyone felt the need to work tonight, so i set it up looking out my window... fortunately said window looks west, and at 9-10:30pm, while i was stargazing, that's where jupiter and the moon were.  riddle me this: what does it say of my fine motor skills that i could find jupiter a full 45 minutes before i could get the moon in the viewfinder... that's just sad...  nice and clear though... could see 4 of jupiters moon nicely too... 3 off to the left, one off to the right (only i have a reflective telescope so i guess that means reverse "left" and "right" in real life)... i watched it for quite some time... it was so bright though that i couldn't really make out stripes on jupiter itself even under higher magnification... oh well... it was still beautiful =)  after that i watched the moon for a bit... it's really cool to look at the valleys/craters right on the edge of the shadow =)  then, roommate called me back from earlier and we talked nearly an hour and a half... well maybe not quite that much but definitely more than an hour... i had lots on my mind to vent about and she's good at (a) listening, and (b) sometimes helping me put more precise/clear words on how i feel... yay for roommate =)  tomorrow, colleen's coming with me to church... i went with her to mass in january, and she's coming with me finally now =P... paul and sujith, (both a year ahead of us) are apparently meeting us there too... shall be entertaining to have a whole "rutgers math pew" in church in the AM ;-P  on that note... night y'all =P

      ben and me saw "two brothers" tonight... mostly it made me mad at people in general for being ignorant and destructive... i think that was kinda the point (the movie ends with a conservation message about saving endangered tigers)... the scenery and filming was incredible, but there was onyl one likeable human character out of many many the whole movie.  so it goes... it made me mad, but i'm still glad i saw it.  seeing movies isn't all that revolutionary though, so what gives with the title?  so i've been chatting with online friend "black death" since high school... we've agreed to meet up for the first time ever in a week and a half on my drive to memphis... he lives near columbus and i'll pass through there around lunchtime that day anyhow...   realize i've been talking to this guy for 5 going on 6 years now, and in that time up until a couple months ago, i had an online personality, a first name, an email address and that's it... in march or so he sent me a photo...  and tonight i suddenly have his cell number and full name... this will be entertaining to be sure... i'm interested to meet him, but have a hard time with changing friendships, so it's a huge deal in my mind to switch from IM friend (which is completely in my comfort zone) to meeting up (which will be an adventure)... and he wanted to call me tonight and i freaked and turned off my phone, claiming the battery to be dead because i'm not quite mentally ready to take that step yet... i'm not scared of him, i'm working on not being scared of change... probably in the next few days i'll have an interesting chat to tell y'all about :-P  revolutionary indeed.  night y'all.

      it's been a good day  not productive, but good  talked online for a bit, officially got the call/chat from paul ellis that i'm next year's pizza seminar coordinator, went to panera and barnes and noble with colleen and scott, and now, after running from my car to the house in the rain, i'm drenched  one would think that i could get lots done in a bookstore since it's quiet and filled with books encouraging me to think and be good... guess again.  scott and me first beelined for the kids section where he read me "go dog go" and "a fly went by" (or something similar on the 2nd title)-- both dr. seuss... i got distracted by magazines and other fun... found the "is your mama a llama?" book again and got scott to read another one called "the grapes of math"... it was fun all around.  but how much work did i do?  1 problem that i had an idea how to solve before :-P  now dinner, and hopefully seeing "two brothers" with ben when he gets out of class... in a bit (once i have de-soaked) i also just have to scan the birthday card my dad sent this week -- it's great :-)  later dudes =)

      i need to develop the ability to sleep for more than 2-3 hours at a time again, because i can't anymore...  two nights ago i went to sleep at 3:30am and woke up with a jolt at 6:16am convinced that i had slept 15 hours or something ridiculous... looked closer at the clock and realized, no, i really should still be in bed  last night, similar... went to sleep at 4:30am and woke up suddenly at 6:40... was convinced i had slept for 14 hours and started to get up and do stuff, only to realize i'd only been in bed for 2 hours.  even after going back to sleep, both nights i woke up again around 10 and made myself go back to sleep again before getting up noon-ish.  this wouldn't be quite as strange if like i normally got up at 6/7am, but i never do intentionally...  this also wouldn't be quite as bad if i thought i was completely stressed out; but here, i am summer time, with a schedule of "wake up when i want, study some, have some fun with my friends, go to sleep when i'm tired"... it bothers me that i'm yawning all the time and not able to sleep for more than 2-3 hours... maybe i need drugs. =P

      email i got earlier from someone my parents' age: "Lara, Just read your latest email...what a life you live, you go girl!  Wish I had done more of those fun things when I was your age."  question (which i have asked before): do i really lead that exciting a life, or is that just the theme of my generation and the people who tell me such things don't know enough 20-somethings =P?  discuss.  in other news...  scott and colleen came over tonight to share pictures (scott got back 3 rolls of film going back to january and colleen got some back from the weekend at the gardens today) and to watch a movie (watched "bend it like beckham")...  at 1am when we were done, we headed for a diner for some late night dinner... there, we ran into ben, jason, and inessa (ben and jason are older math students, inessa just finished undergrad and has been dating jason for years)... we joined them for a bit, enjoyed our evening breakfast food, and then all headed home...   got home to witness a very drunk roommate doing things that hopefully won't happen again before i move out in august =P... who knows... enough said.  on that note, reading myself to sleep... night y'all =P

      i started studying for quals today.  eric and me agreed to start by just working brute force at solving old qual problems from tests from previous years... after 5 hours and solving all of 1 problem on my own, i was mad and ready to throw things and/or cry... ben gave me hints on 2 analysis problems i was mad at, and i called eric to see how he's doing with it... happily enough, his first day at it was similar to mine, which is encouraging... but he's worked at it for a few days already and is a bit ahead of me... i now have thoughts on how to do at least parts of 5 problems, so that's something right?  still... all this is to say, if i work as hard as i'm supposed to, this is going to be a long and extremely frustrating summer of work =(  the end.

      so you thought it was over and the countdown was reset to 364 days, but not so much... last night was the good chats and dinner night... tonight was the crazy night...  first though, i had to give a talk to the rutgers REU kids... eric had called late last night and we talked til nearly 3am my time... and then i crashed... i kept dreaming that i overslept and missed giving the talk or that i screwed it up somehow or another, but i did wake up on time, get some breakfast, and practice my talk before heading to campus to give it... and here's proof that eric's just that great... we were talking at 3am my time/midnight his... he generally stays up til 2 or 3am, and then sleeps til noon... he set his alarm for 9am his time/noon mine and was like "ok, so you're freaking out about the talk, i don't have a planned peptalk, but like i can totally field all your usual ridiculous questions... so have at it"... yeah, eric's great :-)  long story short (or at least this part of it), i gave the talk, the audience cheered and approved, asked good questions, and even the one professor who sat in came up afterwards and complimented me heartily.  thus ends the being responsible part of the day.  although there was dinner last night, the thing i really really wanted to do for my birthday was see a broadway show, so sarah, scott, ben, and me had tickets for "movin' out" tonight...  sarah had to work til late, so scott, ben, and i caught the 3:30 train to penn station, then beelined for the world's largest toys r us (in times square) -- it was great, because although i've been there many times, it's a completely different dynamic for everything when you put ben and scott together... scott oohed and aahed at the huge moving dinosaur and ben played with action figures... we all danced the hokey pokey and the chicken dance with the dancing elmos, and scott freaked out over a kids book and had to read it to us (called  my mamma is a llama  or something like that)... it was just plain hilarious -- it's fun to hang out with people who can be completely ridiculous like that!  after dinner at sbarro and a run through the hershey store just to get high on chocolate smells without actually buying anything, we headed to the broadway/43rd street starbucks where we were meeting up with sarah... we met up with her, and meandered to another starbucks and then to wait for doors to open for the play.  so, "movin' out" -- fantastic!  it's a broadway musical centered totally around the music of billy joel... i think you have to have a real appreciation for billy joel music to get the most out of it... there was a plot, but no dialogue -- just a band (handpicked by billy joel) that was on a platform that moved on the stage or up in the air depending on the scene and lots of ballet people (handpicked by twila tharp) going along with the music -- impressively there were a handful of songs neither scott nor i knew, but the choreography was amazing!... each scene was just a single billy joel song, or a couple glued together, kinda like rock concert meets ballet... scott and i (and occasionally ben) sang at the top of our lungs along with the songs we knew (and it was so loud you couldn't really hear us anyhow so we weren't being distracting, just laughing our heads off and having a blast!)... they did a really weird arrangement of "we didn't start the fire" though that we didn't recognize until the words started and "pressure" was done in like double time with the cheesy synthesizer line replaced by something else... sarah commented though, that even being less familiar with the songs, the choreography, especially in act 2, was completely amazing... so yeah, we all had a blast... and scott and me sang ourselves nearly hoarse =P  when the play got out (10ish) no one wanted to go home yet, so we all wandered towards penn station, didn't see anywhere to stop, so we headed east a bit and ended up at some random pub for 2.5 hours... sarah, scott, and ben split 2 pitchers of beer, i had 3 margaritas, and we all split miscellanous fun food... the thing is alcohol makes me quieter and tireder... coffee's what makes me do crazy stuff, so it was tasty, but i was the quietest in the bunch, still it was a hilarious conversation and we had fun... we left mostly because there were 2 trains left going back to jersey before sunrise, and we figured if we at least tried to make the earlier of the 2 (the 12:42am train) we'd for sure make it home... we ran into the station and onto the train as they were calling "all aboard" and ready to head out...   scott, ben, and me laughed most of the way home, and then riding in my car back to campus, we sang along with toy story and lion king songs on the CD i had in my radio -- me, ben, and scott trying to sing along with the high parts of hakuna matata at 2am... yeah... it was durn entertaining :-)  now, i'll get photos tomorrow and scan them for your laughter enjoyment, and scott owes me a dramatic reading of "go dog go" (kids book) tomorrow afternoon -- i'm excited =P  time to get un-manhattan-ified (i.e. i always feel gross and sticky after getting back from the city), and get some sleep... yeah, it's been a durn good day :-)  night y'all!

      just chatted with eric for over an hour again... made one random comment that he remarked was actually mildly profound  me: "so i was telling my mom about the whole sense of rhythm issue, and instead of listening to my whole paragraph, she started counting along with the song on the radio, trying to get me to hear it just by her counting... dude, why does everyone do this?  i don't need people to count at me and tell me what i should be hearing... i need people to listen to what i hear and help me figure out how to adjust that!"  eric: "dude, congratulations, i think you've finally clearly phrased the problem with nearly every education system that exists -- people tell people what they should think instead of adapting methods to meet them with where they're at -- good job!"  that's about as much as i'm capable of thinking at 3am... night :-P

      half an hour more of it being my birthday -- woohoo.  since the nicole package came, i was moderately productive.  (1) went to campus to see the room i'm giving the lecture in tomorrow and tried out my chocolate on magnets trick again... it looks like it should work alright.  (2) went and got my first more-significant-than-just-a-trim haircut in well over a year -- i told the lady i wanted 2 to 3 inches off, and notice that the ends aren't just the same length -- i like them a little layered... she took like 6 inches off the front, 3 off the back, and did crazy layers everywhere -- jessica says it looks good... i'm still adjusting :-P  (i don't doubt her opinion, i just have to get used to it) ;-)  (3) came home and caught up on email ... eric called and sang half the birthday song, brother called and told jokes for a bit, roommate called and sang me a birthday song she personally wrote  (4) got more fun birthday mail  (5) jessica came over!  we chatted for a bit between my phone calls this afternoon, then...  (6) all the people who are in town right now came out for dinner with me (john, emily, scott, mike, colleen, and vicki joined me and jessica)... we went to tgi fridays, and scott made the wait staff sing at me, although our waitress forgot the words to their restaurant variation on the birthday song... it was entertaining, even though i kicked scott hard under the table for it =P  (7) after dinner, everyone went home, and jessica and i chatted for another hour before she just headed back to philly  all in all, an enjoyable day... oh! and here's your final silly IM statement of the day:  krispudwell: HAPPY BIRTHDAY to You!!!  (Imagine me singing at the top of my lungs...not shouting...or maybe shouting from 1300 miles away????)  heh... i'm officially 23... how weird is that?  night y'all.

      i started writing this blog several months after it happened, but by now you should all realize that nicole unrath, one of my roommate's last spring, and one of my best friends throughout undergrad at valpo, died in a car wreck last september.  nicole was always the one person i was guaranteed a long newsy happy birthday card from on time, AND a good long chat the day of my birthday... i'm gonna really miss that.  this year, it's been interesting what reminds me of nicole.  a month ago, her mom sent out pictures of nicole's room and asked what each of just a handful of us would like in particular.... ironically, today, on my birthday, i just got the package... bittersweet really... it's hard to sort through stuff that was nicole's and is now mine because she's gone, but on the other hand, even though she's been gone 9.5 months, she still managed to get to me on my birthday.  go figure.  (and now the song that randomly comes on the radio is "we can cry with hope, we can say goodbye with hope, because we know our goodbye is not the end, we can grieve with hope because we believe with hope because there's a place where we'll see your face again" -- not an easy afternoon)  dude, time to be emotional for a bit i guess, and then get going with my day.  later =)

      officially happy birthday to me ;-P  already, in the hour since midnight, dave beagley called, sang at me, and then chatted for half an hour... he wins first person to sing at me, and hopefully there will only be a limited number of those :-P (no reflection on dave's singing ;-)... reflection on how many times i hear happy birthday in the next 23 hours)  lkp 42 42 42(me): dude hockey7183 (steve klee): dude hockey7183: boldog szuletesnapot {lara's note... this = happy birthday in hungarian} lkp 42 42 42: people are calling me and singing at me lkp 42 42 42: it's scary lkp 42 42 42: 1 person already did... 2 called earlier and said they were calling back this afternoon to sing at me hockey7183: do you have a lot of tone deaf friends? lkp 42 42 42: lol lkp 42 42 42: actually a lot of them used to be in choir hockey7183: well that's good  lkp 42 42 42 (me): dude smswtshnn (scott): dude lkp 42 42 42: someone already called me from missouri to sing happy birthday at me lkp 42 42 42: both eric and roommate have sworn to do the same smswtshnn: :-D lkp 42 42 42: you really don't want to sing at me later, ok? smswtshnn: :-)  okay, don't worry lkp 42 42 42: promise? smswtshnn: pinky-swear  i saw zoolander on TV tonight -- highly amusing, yet one of the dumbest movies i've ever seen!  worked on the notes for my talk (zoolander was on back to back and i saw the first half of the first time through and the second half of the second time through), then had a few phone calls.  roommate called to see when i'd be free tomorrow (today now) for her to call and sing at me...... eric called to ask 1 question (about quals studying), and we talked for nearly an hour and a half, and he's threatening to sing when he calls me tomorrow too... duuuuude!  oh, and it's a small world -- things are starting up for the new 1st year students at the LCMS seminary in st. louis,... apparently dave beagley met josh hatcher (dave's a 2nd year there now... josh is my age, but took longer to do undergrad... he and i were both officers at the same time at my high school youth group in memphis) -- majorly go figure!  done rambling... running through my dumb math talk once, then going to sleep so i can have some fun tomorrow :-)... jessica's coming up for dinner! (yay!) and scott's promised to drink lots of margaritas with me (yay again!); it'll be a good evening :-)  night y'all.

      birthdays always crack me up... some people know you well, and plan weeks in advance for what to get you; others know you just as well but it's more their style to just send an e-card or call you, or something...  but for like everyone else, there's some socially mandated protocol that if you somehow hear it's someone's birthday you must make a point of telling them "happy birthday!" regardless of whether you really have something more to say or not... it cracks me up :-P  e.g. my away message for half the day today was the conversation w/ my g-ma on the phone from earlier... amanda saw that before she went to her parents place for father's day (and she won't be back til next weekend) so she left an index card on the table before she left reading "happy birthday!" -- cute and nice, and prime example of the above paragraph :-)  natalie called me earlier today to check when i was coming through with eric... she somehow got wires crossed and thought that me and eric were coming this next weekend instead of similar dates in JULY, and was all worried that she would be at a conference when we were supposed to stay with her... after finally realizing june and july are two different months :-) "have a great birthday tomorrow!" was the end of our chat =)  neighborest heather IMed me earlier: JoyNotes5: Ha, your grandma IS the coolest. ;-)  I"m off to the ice rink, but wanted to smile at you from many miles away...*waves an arm* can you see me! *waves both arms* how about now?...no?  Hmm...*buffs and polishes teeth to alabaster perfection* ok, you've GOTTA be able to see 'em shinin' NOW!  ...maybe?  *sigh* guess this will have to do... :-D  JoyNotes5: JOY and SUPER happy Birthday wishes for TOMORROW.  :-)  she makes me smile :-)  and the list continues.  it's just amusing to me that in general people build up so much to their birthday, which in reality is just another day, but it's fun to get the attention for 24 hours give or take =P  i don't know that this entry really has a point, and since i think i'm rambling, i'm done :-P  happy sunday to all y'all =P

      from last night:  ben:  lara and me are like kindling -- we ignite the excitement in each other, and act like little kids  (clear in context, sounds kinda shady in print =P)  9:15 this morning (phone rings) me: hi grandma!  how are you? grandma pudwell: hi lara!  happy birthday! me: um, thanks grandma: it is your birthday, isn't it?  i just wanted to be the first to wish you a happy birthday. me: it's tomorrow, but thanks -- so you are the first :-) grandma: oh!  the 22nd? me: nope, still the 21st... today's the 20th grandma: ooooh, well i haven't mailed your card out yet, and i guess i was the first to call you -- have a good day and have a happy birthday tomorrow, i'll talk to you then  (dude, my grandma's great :-))  austin powers (the original one) is on TBS right now... it started while i was finishing lunch... i've only seen it once before (probably in 1998, the year after it came out) and i wasn't the most amused by it then... however, even though some of it i still think is really dumb, i'm actually halfway amused so far this time through... maybe i'll actually stay put and watch the whole thing =P  joy.  later dudes.

      so yeah, it was a good one.  re: the last entry, scott's a gimp because he backed out last minute on our trip to the gardens... otherwise everything was as planned or better.  we left campus around 1pm, and it took 2.5 hours to drive to these gardens (30-45 minutes west of philly), so we got there finally around 3:30... we did a lot of walking right off... meadow walk, forest walk, italian water gardens, etc... waterfall gardens and a bell tower... a kids garden, a sensory garden (plants you can touch, smell, etc.)... and then around 6 the carillon show started... in the waterfall garden there was a huge belltower, and someone gave a concert at 6... we meandered back over there by 6:15 and sat in the hill garden and listened for a bit -- it was really nice  about then, we decided we should get some dinner before the rest of the evening... so we did... then at 7:30 we got tickets for the chester county symphony playing in the outdoor theater... they played "from the movies", so like part of the nutcracker, a song from fantasia, a bit from carmen, a few others, and finally ended on the theme from star wars -- it was fantastic!... other than the part where the older man in front of me moved his chair, and landed with one leg of the chair right on my foot and sat again before i could stop him... i was wincing in pain for most of the next to last piece... but to make up for it i caught a lightning bug in my hands during the star wars theme (the last song) and was thrilled no end :-)  as soon as that concert was done, we raced over to see the fountain display -- tons of fountains lit up and set to music (kinda like a combination of the lights show at niagara falls at night or the show at the centennial park olympic fountain in atlanta, only fancier in the "we're in a really nice garden" kind of way)... most of the music they did it to was gershwin, and i looooove gershwin, so absolutely fantastic!  finally, we wandered through the indoor conservatory, and ben and i stopped for awhile in the courtyard (since it blocked out lights from around) and spotted tons of constellations -- it was great!!!  in the end, we left 5 minutes before the gardens closed, drove the 2.5 hours back home, and now here 1am, i'm back... what a day :-)  the drive home was especially entertaining because like... dude, how often is it that you're out with math people where the guys are outnumbered by the girls... it was only a group of 3 of us, but it was exceedingly abnormal and amusing dynamics... we spent the drive home with ben asking questions like "so why on earth do most girls... (fill in blank)?" and other such fun, which made for lots of amusement the whole way back  yeah, basically, it was a quality day.  now to worry about my talk tomorrow :-P  later dudes.

      ben and me got back an hour ago from seeing "the terminal"... you'll read all kinds of reviews, and there's nothing to make mine better than anyone elses, but the movie had spirit and it wasn't a story that's been done before; i thought tom hanks did an excellent job, and i was happy with how it ended although catherine zeta-jones character got on my nerves a little... it's on the higher end of movies i've liked this year -- by all means go see it!  we were going to see "around the world in 80 days" earlier in the week except ben's been swamped in grading and writing midterms for the class he's teaching that it didn't happen... we were going to go tomorrow too, until colleen had other ideas...  tomorrow, scott, colleen, ben, and me are going  here  for the day... colleen really wants to see the fountain show and possibly go to the concert; we'll see how this works... should be nice though.  and here's survey of the week -- dare i meet crazy online friend who i've been chatting with since high school?  the main conundrum is that even with people i know well in both contexts, people interact very differently online than they do in person sometimes (and i'm sure i do too), that i'm not afraid of him, but rather of the off chance that we'll meet up for lunch and then not get along quite the same way as we have for so long online.... i don't want to go on my trip to memphis, stop off in ohio and meet him, and then have the next chat have an undertone of "so you're not who i expected you to be"; and not that that's guaranteed, it's a nagging concern though, because this whole concept is a minorly big deal in my head :-P  but hey, we're talking about lara -- lara who's always travelling, meeting new people, and trying new things... fear of leaving a comfort zone doesn't stop me -- it just makes me overanalyze first =P  so that's the scoop... if we're really going to this garden tomorrow, i should get some shut-eye... night y'all  p.s. exactly 2 days 17 hours and 41 minutes til i'm 23 -- how scary is that? =P

      i miss budapest.  to remedy that, roommate (kristin) and i have been talking about going to europe for a couple weeks next summer... budapest and ICB (international church of budapest, my church the whole 4.5 months i was there) for sure... probably vienna and maybe prague and/or somewhere else besides... roommate's never been out of north america; i just really really want to go back!  all this looking at maps, train/air fares, and things to do is making me all nostalgic. =P  what got us started on this tonight though?  email from a couple hours ago:  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Date: Thu, 17 Jun 2004 19:24:19 -0500  Subject: BSM All Class Reunion  From: "Budapest Semesters"    Add to Address Book  To: "Budapest Mathematics"          The Budapest Semesters in Mathematics Program will celebrate its 20th  year with a gala all class reunion to be held in Budapest, June 15-23,  2005.  Events will include several talks on the history of the program and a  plenary lecture or two. But the emphasis will be on reunion with plenty  of time to visit with former professors and classmates.  If you’ve been itching to return to Budapest but never found the right  moment, plan for next summer. If you’d like to receive additional  information about the reunion, please fill out the pre-registration  form at  www.stolaf.edu/depts/math/budapest ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  woo hoo!!!! :-)

      i've so enjoyed the week so far without having a roommate, that amanda unexpectedly coming back an hour ago throws a damper on the next few days...  yeah she lives here too, but when i left to go sign the lease on my new place, i didn't expect to come home to her with a friend saying "well, so i have a boy coming over tonight, so i moved some of your stuff that was out here, can you move the rest before he gets here?"  i feel cornered... i'm in my room with a book because she's out in the tv room chatting it up with her friend about stuff i'm not really interested in at all.  i need to get over myself and stop complaining... just 2 more weeks really, then i'll be in memphis, then driving cross country, and then the lease will have started on my new place... 2 more weeks...

      the page i just read, in the book i'm reading for fun this week: (i was just going to quote the last line, but jessica, i bet you especially will appreciate the bit before :-)... and probably a few of you others =P)  enjoy:  God the Geometer  The ancients believed that the world was made up of four basic elements: earth, water, air, and fire.  Foreshadowing the atomic theory of matter of twentieth-century science, around 350 B.C. the ancient Greek philosopher Plato, in his book  Timaeus , theorized that these four elements were all aggregates of tiny solids.  As the basic building blocks of all matter, he argued, these four elements must have perfect geometric form, namely the shapes of the five regular solids that so captivated the Greek mathematicians -- the perfectly symmetric tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, icosahedron, and dodecahedron.  As the lightest and sharpest of the elements, said Plato, fire must be a tetrahedron.  Being the most stable, earth must consist of cubes.  Water, because it is the most mobile and fluid, has to be an icosahedron, the solid that rolls most easily.  As to air, he observed somewhat mysteriously that "...air is to water as water is to earth," and concluded, even more mysteriously, that air must therefore be an octohedron.  Finally, to account for the last regular solid, he proposed that the dodecahedron represented the shape of the entire universe.  Although the particulars of Plato's theory can easily be dismissed as whimsy, the philosophical assumptions behind it are exactly the same as those that drive science today.  The universe is constructed in an ordered fashion that can be understood using mathematics.  To Plato as to many others, God must surely have been a geometer.  Or as the great Italian scientist Galileo Galilei wrote in the seventeenth century, "In order to understand the universe, you must know the language in which it is written.  And that language is mathematics."  ~from  The Millenium Problems  by Keith Devlin, pages 64-65.  (lara's footnote -- if you don't remember the Platonic solids from pre-calc or something, good moveable pictures  here .)

      things that annoy me:  (1) the tiny washer/dryer units at my apartment complex that cost $1/machine/load and don't even completely dry my clothes... highly unfortunate waste of $$$  (2) people who go through the express lane with more than twice the quota of items... i can see going through with 11 items in a 10 item or less lane, but not 25... furthermore, it adds insult to injury to the people waiting behind you when said person leaves their cart in line and goes to get *more* stuff, is gone for 10 minutes, and pushes their way back in front of you even though the line has moved on... does anyone else get as super annoyed by people who do this?  on a happier note, got my cashier's check for my share of the new apartment security deposit... it'll officially be ours in 3 hours :-)  later dudes

      we got a house, we got a house, hey hey hey hey, we got a house!  so colleen called this one apartment ad this morning, played phone tag with the guy all day and we met him this evening and saw the place... it's in highland park -- clear the other direction of campus from where i am now, but a little closer to campus.  the landlord is the fire marshall for the town... he lives across the street... we'll rent the top floor of a 2 story house, with our own washer/dryer... 3 bedrooms, 1 bath, kitchen, dining area, and living room... plus a fireplace and a porch... the yard is nice and well-landscaped... kinda has a cute garden-y feel... we meet again tomorrow to hand over the security deposit and sign the lease... it'll be great :-)  yay for having a place to live.  just talked to eric -- we decided we're not bad people if we don't start studying til next week, so that's the new plan :-P  hopefully seeing "around the world in 80 days" whenever ben gets back from class... woohoo. =P  later dudes =P

      today's been a good day  (1) woke up to an email from steve klee -- our paper from last spring was accepted to be printed in "international journal of mathematics and mathematical sciences"... this will be my 3rd published math article  (2) colleen and i had lunch together and went househunting -- several good prospects (the one from last week had shady comments from most tenants on apartmentreviews.com or something, so we're holding off on it)... visiting 1 in a couple hours and another tomorrow night.  (3) got an email from my aunt susan (dad's sister)... i haven't seen her since g-pa pudwell died (7.5 years ago),... nonetheless we have plans to meet up for dinner while i'm on my roadtrip with eric next month -- yay!  (4) i have friends to celebrate my birthday with... this is the first time i've had more than one person to hang out with at once since my 20th birthday at my REU in texas 3 years ago... so far ben, scott, sarah, and i will see "movin out", the broadway musical that's all billy joel music on tuesday night... day after my birthday, but also after my dreaded REU talk is done :-P  yay!  now, if only i could find that book ;-P  later dudes

      i bought a book at a used book store last april called _the science of God_... i thought i knew exactly where it was on my bookshelf when i wanted to start in on it tonight, however apparently it has a mind of its own and is hiding from me.  i offer $1 (yes, a whole freakin dollar -- but think of all the endless possibilities of things you can buy at a dollar store with that) to the first person who either (a) comes and visits me and locates said book before i do, or (b) successfully guesses where it is long-distance (and tells me their guess, thereby leading to discovery of the book) before i find it =P  oh! and if for some reason you're borrowing it from me and i forgot i lent it out, that doesn't count, but letting me know you have it is appreciated =P  for reference, i've scoured all the bookshelves and in around and under both of my bookcases, and in the stack of boxes in my living room, so guess elsewhere =P  good luck!  here ends this public service announcement =P

      g-ma (the one i just saw yesterday) was put in the hospital this afternoon.  they're concerned about a sore on her foot that's healing weird (and she's diabetic so they take longer to heal) and not getting better how it should... dad, who took the message while mom was out, was very mellodramatic about it like something horrible is going to happen... mom's convinced it's just a preventative measure  mom flew back to memphis last night... she expected dad and ryan to pick her up in her van, which they did.. but 5 miles away from the airport the van made a horrendous popping noise (which they later discovered was the transmission completely dying)... they miraculously made it to the airport passenger loading area, where it died... it was 2am before they all got home... mom got a new car today -- a 1997 chevy blazer.  and then there's me... for not seeing anyone all day, i sure do write a lot... i don't know what to make of the g-ma story... but i've given plenty of my thoughts on her already this weekend... i guess we just gotta see what happens... and i'm meanwhile i'm having a delightful time avoiding the world -- spaghetti and watching "miss congeniality" on TV  later dudes

      well, maybe not the world, but the country... i've been on the phone for the past 2 hours..  half an hour chatting with colleen about housing; we're doing lunch tomorrow and then visiting more places =P  half an hour on the phone talking with eric about our trip next month and about math stuff; we agreed that tomorrow we'll chat again and make ourselves a studying for quals schedule to keep each other on track; we studied for math GREs together for a semester in budapest - hopefully studying together again even long distance over the rest of the summer will be good for us too =P  20 minutes playing phone tag w/ dad for a plant question  then 40 minutes on the phone with ian renner... he was online this afternoon for the first time since march/april, when he told me his dad had died earlier in the spring; i got more details actually talking to him... he's done with his masters degree in statistics and living in michigan indefinitely long to help his mom and grandma cope with things now that his dad is gone; as luck would have it, he'll be in detroit for a concert the same day as eric and me will be there visiting on our trip, so hopefully i'll get to see the boy for the first time in well over a year!  and now here it is 6:30 -- what a day... time to read, make dinner, and be a vegetable =P  later dudes =P

      you know, for not having work, etc. to do today, i've done a lot.  i helped colleen sort through apartment ads and called several for us this morning... caught up on some email... read 2 magazines cover to cover (the life special issue of the 7 wonders of the world -- only they have 5 lists of 7... 7 ancient wonders, 7 medieval wonders, 7 natural wonders, 7 modern wonders, and 7 animal wonders -- and the national geographic special issue of "exploring outerspace -- our universe in pictures)... paid all my unpaid bills that i have for the month of june... bought and mailed a father's day card on time =P... and repotted plants  it's this last part that's the mess... i have 4 plants... 2 pothoses (long vine-y climbing plants), and 2 euphorbias (tall leafy things)... i'd left them in the same pots since i moved in august, so all of the above were really outgrowing their current space... so they all graduated today from a 6inch pot and three 4inch pots to an 8 inch and three 6 inchers... for those of you unfamiliar with the art of repotting plants, let me tell you... it does make a most glorious mess...  first you have to put soil in the new pot (which probably drops some specks on the ground... then you have to get the plant out of its old pot (which generally involves some turning the pot on its side and banging so as to get the roots out all at once instead of tearing them... i.e. more dirt spilled), then you have to roughen up the ball of roots so that they're more inclined to grow out into their new space instead of in on themselves (i.e. even more mess), place plant in new pot, and fill around it... as if that isn't enough, after all is done, you water the plant and the soil compacts probably meaning you still need to add some more to fill in gaps (i.e. even more mess)... it's a good thing amanda's gone for now, because if she came home to how the floor looks right now (soil and dead leaves from trimming the plants up) all over the floor, even if it is mostly on newspaper, she'd have a cow... at least i did all this on the kitchen tile floor instead of on the white carpet everywhere else, right? ;-P  now, back to reading, or plotting, or something =P  later dudes =P

      as promised... as if this is exciting... heh  (1) road construction:  going less than 10 miles in 2 hours on the interstate is pretty outrageous... whoever's in charge of pennsylvania interstate construction should know better than to filter 3 lanes of harrisburg interstate traffic through a rest area PARKING LOT!  it's one thing to merge everyone into one lane, (which some people can't handle already!)  it's a totally other thing to filter that one lane through a parking lot where people are pulling in and out and blocking the one lane of traffic... summary: i was incredibly annoyed friday afternoon.  (2) best lunch for $1.35 ever made up for the construction though =)  to get to g-ma's i drove the better part of 200 miles on the PA turnpike... a few of the travel plazas have farmers markets and this trip was the first i'd noticed any of them being open.. for $1.35 i got two huge green bell peppers and a cucumber and ate them as i drove for lunch... it was a party :-)  (3) i rambled about the g-ma thing already before i left... i guess the weird part is, although she's been in the nursing home for 4 years now, for the first 3 or so, whenever we visited her behavior was consistent... not really better, not really worse.... from my most recent visits (june 2003, august 2003, november 2003, january 2004, this weekend) there's been noticeable changes from june/aug to nov/jan and from nov/jan to now... last summer g-ma was slow to respond and didn't speak clearly (half her vocal chords are paralyzed and half her mouth muscles too so that's how it is), but she answered the questions you asked her, and remembered things.... in november she started acting kind of weird... like would have me push her in her wheelchair "to my other room" or "to the room at the end of the hallway" giving me directions as we went and then she'd end us up at a fire escape or something and seem extremely disoriented... but at least in november she was happy to see us and had a "good day" the first day or two we were around even if she got tired later in the visit... this time, the first 3 of the 4 days we were around the response to "how are you?" was "miserable"... reaching for things that weren't there... responding to different questions than we asked, or completely neglecting to notice someone had asked her something... and just about every time she did answer what was asked of her, the answer was completely false (e.g. mom asked her how church was last week and g-ma's response was "i didn't go... my stomach hurt too bad"... but mom's sister debbee was up for the weekend and took her to church!)... mostly it's weird to see someone who you remember clearly as who they used to be become trapped in a physical and mental prison and slowly slip away from you... i have issues with this and i'm not sure how to phrase my thoughts... i have a hard time with the fact that i'm the only grandchild who has opportunity to visit her reasonably regularly and isn't "afraid" of her like my younger cousins are... i have a hard time with myself that i feel like i need to bring "props" (e.g. my photo albums) to be able to talk to her... i feel ridiculous when g-ma tries to speak and we all have to ask her to repeat multiple times before anyone has a clue what she said... i miss the friend of a grandparent she once was and have a hard time responding within myself to how she is now, even if my mom and her sisters compliment me on how i respond to her and engage her on the outside.  yeah, i have issues with this  (4) mom and i had planned to see "raising helen" on saturday, since she wanted to and i was willing to see it again for her sake... turns out though that the time we showed up for (based on friday's posted times) turned out to be a sneak preview of "the notebook" which doesn't come out for 2 more weeks... it was remarkably serendipitous that that's what happened and that we got to see it together... basically an old man is reading a story to an old woman and it flashes back and forth between him reading to her now and to the story he's telling about the 1940s... it comes out eventually that they're married and he's reading their life story to her because she can't remember it because she has senile dementia... the ending is a tearjerker, even for me, who reacts, but doesn't usually *cry* at movies... best line? alli: (lady with senile dementia, in a rare state of knowing what's going on) "so what are you going to do when i don't remember anything at all? how will you deal with it?" noah: (her husband): "i'll still love you and still be here for you... even then" considering we had just been talking about changes with g-ma over dinner right before it, it hit especially close to home to watch that later on... duuude.  (5) besides taking my step g-pa out to lunch on sunday after church (which is interesting b/c out of mom's generation, he talks most freely with her, and out of the grandkid generation, he seems to have the most idea of what to say to me), mom had plans to have lunch with her best friend from high school... i'd heard lots about karen but never met her, which was entertaining since mom considers her to be one of her closest 3 friends, and i know the other 2 extremely well... very cool lady... it was fun... and entertaining to see another side of mom for a bit.  (6) today, after visiting w/ g-ma for a bit, mom and i drove up to alleghany cemetary... my g-pa, his parents, and my uncle (mom's brother who died of cancer at age 6) are all buried there at the top of the highest hill in the place... to put it in context, this place is hundred of acres huge and has graves dating back for hundreds and hundreds of years... impressive mausoleums and war monuments in many parts... all my schumann relatives are buried though at the top of a hill overlooking the city, with a huge statue of jesus holding up a dove to the sky in the middle of their section... it's kinda nice... no one had been up there to clean off the headstones since christmas time, so we worked on that for a bit, talked a bit, and then headed back to aunt pris's before mom had to fly and i had to drive home... i guess in summary it's been kinda a death/old age oriented weekend...  (7) on a cheerier note, when we got back to aunt pris's place, i chatted with her for an hour while mom read, and then headed home to jersey... i like chatting with aunt pris... she talks to me as an equal and relates to me and vice versa, and i like that. =)  plus she's not nosy in a mom/other aunts kind of way... maybe it's the she's the youngest in her generation of the family and i'm the oldest of the next generation thing, but whatever it is, i like her. =)  (8) upon returning, ben and i saw "stepford wives" which i enjoyed, but a couple parts freaked me out to jumping halfway out of my seat... doht... also noted a new starbucks on the way, which is the 3rd one within a 5 minute drive of my place... this makes me happy! =)  (9) no new project for work yet... i guess this means tomorrow i read and convince myself to start preparing my dreaded talk for the REU kids for next tuesday... yikes!  (10) amanda basically moved out yesterday since she's done with her summer internship... she'll be in and out but mostly out for the rest of the summer, so i'll probably read a lot and be nocturnal by choice... by all means, please call and entertain me :-)  yeah, that really *is* the loong version, eh?  i'm done, really, i am.  night y'all. =P

      750 miles round trip this weekend and i'm back in jersey:  the short version? *road construction stinks *farmers markets provide the best cheapest lunch ever *it's weird to have a bit more of grandma "missing" every time i visit... i did a lot of thinking *"the notebook" is a very good movie *i got to meet my mom's best friend from high school... *that* was entertaining *highlight of today?  cleaning off my grandpa, my uncle, and my great grandparents headstones at the huge 100s of acres big cemetary in pittsburgh *i really like chatting with my aunt priscilla  that said, the long version comes later  happy evening dudes

      heading off for pittsburgh in the morning; bound to be an interesting weekend.  i've seen g-ma on "good" days and on "bad" days, and apparently she's on a bad streak lately, although usually the first day we visit she usually is excited enough to see us that it's a "good" day, no matter how she's really feeling.  nonetheless, it's always a mental battle of how to cope with how she is now until i actually get there... once i'm there with mom, it'll be fine... until then, i think too much about it... mostly i just miss who she was before her strokes... so i guess in a way i've been missing her for 4 years even though i've seen her regularly all that time.  4 days in a nursing/retirement home... woo hoo.  catch y'all on monday.

      re: prayer request from yesterday  so my 12 year old cousin is presently in surgery... she hasn't been able to eat or drink anything all week, so they're putting in a stent (sp?) now, and she'll have to have another surgery next week to follow up unless they miraculously catch the stone today.... she's been in intense pain the past couple days and not responding to any medication... here's to hoping it all turns out ok...

      well, not precisely, but it was the most appropriate cliche i could think of for a title...   ugly first... amanda's anti-air conditioning... however, i live and work in our 90+ degree apartment 24/7, whereas she goes away to a nice air-conditioned office during the day... i've started turning on the a/c in the den, and setting up a fan aimed from there into my room when she's not around (start yesterday), and turning it off enough before she gets home that she can't tell.... heh... don't tell amanda.  the good: colleen and i visited an apartment this afternoon... it was one of the only complexes offering 3 bedroom places that have openings for august... with construction it took us 30 minutes from the complex back to campus, but without construction it would be more like 15-20 minutes... we should look into alternate routes...  pluses?  our own washer/dryer.... 3 bedrooms and 3 full baths... for less than $550/month/person... only drawback besides distance is that one of the "bedrooms" is really labeled a "study" and has no windows, except for the ones on the french doors to it... so option 1: someone gets a windowless room with curtains on the doors, or option 2: two of us share the master bedroom which is more than twice the size of the study anyhow... spacewise/new-ness for the money it's by far the best deal we've seen... see floorplan below (clickable for readable version =P):       the bad: talked to mom about things she should copy before she comes to pitt tomorrow so she can be our cosigner (instead of mailing forms, i'll have them instantly over the weekend!)... she said that g-ma's been feeling worse lately and getting sores (these things happen when you've been paralyzed for 4 years and do nothing but sit) that they haven't been able to get rid of yet... mom and her sisters are worried about infection due to her diabetes... that all doesn't sound very good, and i'm a little worried about her now too...  and that's my day so far.... jenny (memphis jenny)'s apparently ordering my birthday present right now and told me if i can find any $5 item on amazon i want in addition to what she's already picked out, then she gets free shipping, so it's complementary birthday present shopping time :-)... then back to work... just 65 more contacts to go!  later dudes =P

      it might be hot if... the popsicles you took out of the freezer melt to liquid within 10 minutes of when you took them out... and you're inside!  current temp 91, heat index 97, lows in the 70s... and does my roommate believe in air conditioning?  um nope..  after 4 hours of working with the windows open and a fan and still having a headache despite drinking like 2 liters of water already today, i gave up, shut the windows, and turned on the AC... too bad it's not in my room!  now, back to work... goal of 850 today, currently at 769... wish me luck =P  later dudes

      I was all excited to have 3 emails when I woke up, but turns out only 1 of them was happy... 2 prayer requests  (1) for my 12 year old cousin... her stomach hurt yesterday, so they figured she had caught the stomach flu from my other cousin.... when the pain changed and got worse, they ended up taking her to the ER last night to find out that she has a kidney stone!  this usually doesn't happen til people are adult age, but apparently she inherited the problem from her genetic father (who my aunt isn't with anymore)... it'll be fine once she passes it, but how long that takes can be variable, and she's in intense pain in the meantime... so yeah, prayers for rachel.  (2) sue nathan, the staffworker for valpo's IVCF (intervarsity christian fellowship) chapter wrote a mass email last night/this morning as well... apaprently charles (her husband)'s mother (who lives in india) is in ICU for seizures, etc., and the doctors aren't giving them too much hope (but they aren't giving up hope either...)... charles's father just died earlier this spring so prayers for comfort/healing/etc. in that situation.  the end.  now i work.

      here it is nearly 1am... looks like 2am is my new official bedtime -- joy.  i did make it to 700 contacts tonight... around 11:30... and since then i've been doing the usual catch up with all 5 email addresses and with all my friends' blogs deal... fun fun... i can't wait til the weekend when i have some time to read! (true i'll be visiting but there comes points of time, when you spend a weekend at a nursing/retirement home that things get dull and you're just sitting there no matter how much you like who you're there to see)  now, here's a little something for everyone:  if you read this to see what i've been up to / what i've felt like rambling my head off about today, you should be satisfied  if you read to vicariously get amanda stories (amanda being my roommate), here's one for you: (we actually chatted for like an hour tonight while we were both making our own dinner, etc.) so ron, her boyfriend of 3 years, broke up with her just after he graduated last month (while i was on my roadtrip), and in the last week she'd had like 4 different guys ask her out... one of them she just had to tell me about... so now that it's summer, people sit on the doorstoops in my apartment complex and chat the evening away... there's a mother of a 5-year old next door who's usually sitting outside my door with a guy from a couple units the other direction on any nights when it's not raining... when i come home i say hi, and ask how they are, then come upstairs to do whatever... amanda on the other hand will chat with them for half an hour before coming up... they know where she does her internship right now (at a local drug store pharmacy) and that ron broke up with her... so the guy came into her store today to get a prescription filled and she tried to hide because she really didn't want to deal with him... it didn't work though, and then apparently told her "so we'll probably be out chatting again tonight... and how about dinner sometime next week?"...  as soon as amanda came home today she came to my room to tell me the story, and then asked me to guess how old the guy was.... until she checked in the pharmacy computer to find out he's 25, she was convinced he was in his 40s and completely grossed out!  (and still does not want to do dinner with him anyhow) i guess it's more amusing how she told it, but nonetheless, there's your amanda update of the day =P  for those of you who read this to live vicariously and get roommate (kristin) updates: (well, who does that... you either know her or you don't?) i'm amazed at what she's doing this summer... she's called me a few times to say hi, and unfortunately usually i'm still working when she calls so we don't talk as long as i'd like, but we did chat for nearly half an hour earlier and that was nice... anyhow, she's on an internship for being a hospital chaplain this summer in houston, texas... during the days they shadow people and do group classes together and stuff, but during the night, the interns all take turns being *the* on-call chaplain for the hospital... i.e. spending the night, and getting paged everytime someone dies or something else warranting a chaplain's presence happens... her first night is tomorrow... but for the intern who covered last night... 7 deaths between 8pm and 4am... *hopefully* she'll have a bit calmer of an evening for her first go around... i just can't imagine doing that... makes me thankful for my 11 hour work days of talking to myself!  finally... now that there's an abstract on the rutgers reu page  http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/REU  i'm starting to freak out a little about my talk for 2 weeks from now... blah.  ok, really, time to chill *away* from the computer =P  night y'all!

      so my boss approves of me going out of town for the weekend if i can if at all possible, finish getting my 1000 contacts by thursday night before i leave...  today's draining though...   (1) i've spent $11 on laundry because the machines are that bad and i had that much to wash... ai yai yai  (2) my goal is 700 contacts by the time i quit today... i started this morning with 550 and told myself lunch was when i got to 600... here it is, 4:15pm, and i'm just up to 592, and not for any lack of trying on my part!  i'd go by hours and not get frustrated, except for the needing to finish by thursday night bit... blah  (3)laptop's being weird so i'm working at the desktop which isn't quite as fun as watching movies in the background while i work, but so it goes :-P  in happier news -- i got back the motor for my telescope from the manufacturer... it had busted the first or second time we took the scope outside, and was covered under warranty... now, when i'm not working 11-12 hour days, i can go stargazing with style again ;-P  back to work  later dudes

      been working away, and now taking a dinner break -- shrimp primavera... and it's at an almost normal dinner time too... i can be good on occasion :-P  obviously, that's not the small world part...   so amanda came home and immediately started cleaning all around me... i felt a little bad, but i was working and i want to get at least 50 more contacts than i presently have before i quit tonight, so i just kept going...  anyhow, while she was cleaning the stairs, some guy showed up... and i recognized his voice!  he's the guy who's been around when i've known it's not ron amanda's hanging out with.... mystery solved  what's even funnier... so i'm sitting in front of the TV with my laptop, working away when they come in and then...  amanda: so this is lara, and lara this is my friend ron... yeah, another ron, we're going out to dinner, see you later ron: hi, actually i think you know one of my roommates me: really?  who? ron: ben bunting me: huh... small world  indeed.  now i wonder who figured out the connection?  as far as i know amanda doesn't know my friends names other than eric, but i could be wrong... maybe it was just the "we both have math graduate roommates" connection... nonetheless, i was amused.  dinnertime.  later dudes. =P

      another one of those days...  this week is looking like unless i make excuses to run errands, i won't leave the house for 3 days again -- how much fun is that?  read til 2am last night (finished leigh's favorite book yesterday afternoon, and then last night i started  the millenium problems  (about the top 7 most high profile unsolved math problems of today, written in laymen's (i.e. including math people who haven't studie those areas in depth) terms), then slept til 10:30 today, and since then it's been a work in front of the TV day... i'm nearly up to 450 contacts before the site i was working off of had its server go down and my computers started acting retarded... i guess that's a hint that it's breakfast/lunch time?  movie of the AM (was on TV earlier, and started just as i turned the TV on)... "herman USA"... real life story about a town in minnesota who had dozens of single guys and about 6 single girls so they had a huge dance/picnic to attract new blood into town... it was entertaining...  have seen bits and pieces of the memorial stuff being done for president reagan's funeral as i flip through too...  in happy news, i got 2 back issues of "mental floss" in the mail just now... "the spy issue" and "the saints and sinners issue"... they even stuck in a personalized hand-written thank you note for my order :-P  when i finish these, (the only 2 issues not sold out from 2002, their first year in print), i'll start ordering the 2003, and the 2004 issues in 2s and 3s as well =P  party indeed.  exciting articles? "fear of all sums: 3 math theories explained to you in plain english", "for the sake of sake" (2nd sake = japanese wine), and "20 to 30 interesting things you never knew before about japan (but who's counting?)".... party indeed...  now for the texas trophy hunters site to come back up.... ah well... lunch!

      had a plant question for my dad earlier, but he's visiting g-ma pudwell for her 79th birthday this weekend... so i figured i'd call and say hi to everyone (parents and the grandmother) all at once... however, it ended up being the weirdest discussion i've ever had with my grandma... ever me: hi grandma! how are you? g-ma: oh hi, how are you? what's wrong? me: nothing, i was just calling to say hi and see how you're doing g-ma: oh, well, lar, then i have terrible news me: what's that? g-ma: luella died on friday... i don't know what i'm gonna do.  luella is g-ma's best friend in her apartment complex... when i was on my roadtrip, i went over to visit with her for an hour and show her pictures as well... when g-ma and g-pa moved to g-ma's current place (when i was in 9th grade), luella and orville were the other couple close in age to my grandparents who had similar ideas of how to spend their time, so they had a lot of fun as a group of 4... then g-pa died so dynamics changed by lu was still g-ma's best friend... now with lu gone, orville's at a complete loss and i'm not sure how long he'll last without her... g-ma's at a loss in her own way too, although she seems to go strong through everything... at least she still has bob (her boyfriend) around...  at any rate... a little bummed about luella... not that i knew her exceedingly well, but i visited with her a bit every time i was around g-mas for the last 9 years and i'm sad for g-ma and for orville that she's gone now...  on the flip side of the coin....  happy quotes of the day ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  pastor j: (in the kids' sermon, holding up an egg): so if i broke this open, i'd have two things... a yoke and....? kid: and a mess!!!  so yeah i dropped my computer the other day and saw some sparks and some smoke come out of it, and so i called gateway and asked them if that was normal and they were like 'no, not at all, what have you done to it?'" ~eric  no, so here's what you do instead... you call up scott and say 'hey, scott, i need to make a phone call and i don't want to', eric says get me some tequila. ~eric  yeah, that transition didn't work so well, but they're still quality quotes, right? =P  time for "lunch"... later dudes

      i didn't sleep much last night... partly because i didn't get home til almost one, and got up early, partly because i was excited for a day of not working and for hanging out with a good friend. :-), but sleep or no sleep, it turned out to be an excellent day.  i got up early to make sure i was ready when jessica got here -- turned out to be plenty early to eat breakfast and to update my website before she got here (see  here ) note especially the updated publications pages... i now have  two  math articles  in print  as opposed to just in the queue! =)  this makes my erdos number  officially  a 4, and this makes me happy (when my paper with Zsolt Tuza as a coauthor gets printed, i'll be a 2, which is even cooler)! =)  anyhow, long story short, jessica got here, we went up to the mall in edison, browsed through barnes and noble, saw "mean girls", which was cute, got lunch @ panera, wandered the mall, then came back to my place to chat until dinner time... then ordered a pizza and rented another movie ("chasing liberty", also cute)... we then watched the end of "back to the future" and the start of "a knight's tale" before jessica had to head back home just now (she has to work in the morning, ai yai yai)... all in all a quality day  footnotes (in chronological order): (1) bonus points to "mean girls" for making the main character a math ace :-) (2) bonus points to "chasing liberty" for filming large portions of the movie in parts of europe i've been to before! (3) eric called mid-afternoon cleaning out his old room in vegas (his family moved this spring) asking if i wanted his old kids' planetarium projector (projects the constellations on your ceiling)... for as many times as i've wandered into toy stores this year and joked about actually spending the money on one, i'm now getting one for free :-) (4) quote from cspan when we heard the news earlier that former president reagan had died this afternoon -- random caller from AZ: "my condolences to the reagan family... i was focusing my thoughts on president reagan the other day and i'm afraid my mental powers may have killed him" (5) it's so great to have someone who's known me more than a year around relatively close at hand... it's been another 1.5 months since we got to hang out, but i like hanging out with jessica a bunch... there's something cool about hanging out with friends who have known you through several phases of your life (hs, college, and now grad school) that makes chatting with them especially valuable and cool :-) and this makes me happy :-)  yay for jessica :-) (6) finally, i got an email from my boss when i came back to the computer just now "Thanks Lara, I really appreciate all your work....you're doing great! Carolyn", so i'm getting favorable reviews all around -- yay :-)  now, time to finish the fiction book i've been reading ( arrows of the queen , leigh's favorite book ever) and get some sleep... early church tomorrow, then picking up colleen's sister from the airport -- fun, eh?  a most excellent night to all y'all =)

      having worked a 30 hour week in 3 days basically, i'm tired... got to 402 contacts before i quit at 8:30 tonight, so go me!  then, after dinner and chatting with my brother for half an hour, (brother quote of the day: "so i asked dad what exactly they do at 'strategic planning meetings' for the botanic garden... he said they're trying to brainstorm and come up with a new attraction... so i suggested they hire a clown that juggles pitchforks of flaming manure... he somehow didn't find it that funny, but what do you think?")...ben and i saw another movie... after van helsing and the crazy indian movie, i had earned another chick flick, so we saw "raising helen"...  while not the best movie of all time, we both left the theater going "dude, well, that was cute"... the movie also gets bonus points because (1) they actually gave NJ Transit trains a good rap =) (2) kate hudson's character falls for a hockey goalie lutheran pastor... (there were horrible horrible religion jokes that ensued, but it was cute nonetheless... best quote of the movie? after a little bit of kate hudson being weird about the guy just because he was a pastor, he ended a paragraph with "... but that's ok because i'm a sexy man of God and i know it") (3) finally, the movie gets bonus points for having several places in it that ben and i could poke each other and go "we were there last week!  we were there last week!"... there was even a closeup of a cow at the central park zoo that i have my picture with from february... i laughed =P  the end -- jessica comes in the morning! =) time for me to get some shut eye before she does =P

      got tired of working at my desk, and straightened out the laptop, so it's working in front of the TV time again... despite our 70+ channels or whatever, there's absolutely nothing worth watching on... so movie time again... can you name the movie i'm watching for the first time in years from (1) the lyrics to the intro song, (2) a give-away quote near the beginning, and (3) a coffee quote a little farther in =P  (1) if only i could have a puppy, i'd call myself so very lucky just to have some company to share a cup of tea with me i take my puppy everywhere, la la la la, i wouldn't care; we'd stay away from crowds, besides that said no dogs allowed, oh we, i know he'd never bite me, we, i'd know he'd never bite me  if only i could have a friend, to stick with me until the end, and walk along beside the sea and share a moon with me; i take my friend most everywhere, la la la la, i wouldn't care, but we'll stay away from crowds, besides that said no friends allowed, oh we'd be so happy to be together, oh we'd be so happy to be together  but dreams are nothing more than wishes and a wish is just a dream, wish to come true...  (2) brinkley is my dog.  he loves the streets of new york as much as i do. although he likes to eat bits of pizza and bagels off the sidewalk and i prefer to buy them.  (3) the whole purpose of places like starbucks is for people with no decision making ability whatsoever to make 6 decisionss just to buy 1 cup of coffee.  short tall light dark decaf low-fat non-fat etc. so people who don't know what the hell they're doing or who on earth they are can for only $2.95 get not just a cup of coffee but an absolutely defining sense of self.  tall! decaf!! cappuccino!!!  yesterday's movie answer? "runaway bride"... yeah, laugh, i'm a girl... some days =P

      i put my name in google just now, as i'm bound to do every few months when i'm bored, and i got 135 results (eventually it switches from fun math stuff and stuff i've actually written to some german opera singer named laura pudwell, but still)  (1) i have no idea how my website got to be posted  here , but i have no problem with it being on a site labeled "mathematicians -- 174 of the best sites selected by humans"  (2) similarly -- no clue, but the only link  here  (sciencedaily.com) under "links about P" is my site again... dude  all this is to say, apparently my website gets around more than i thought it did =P  funny how it isn't the number one hit when you put in "lara pudwell" into google though -- an atrocious picture from when i visited my friend paul at carnegie melon taken just after we had walked up 11 flights of stairs is instead... bother.  now, time to eat.

      "because of [my] responsible credit history" (laugh #1), i've won "a check for $1600 to go on a cruise to las vegas".    last i checked vegas was kinda landlocked, so i'm not quite sure how that works.  all they want in return is me to fill out an evaluation of my trip when i return... and for the $1600 to be the first bit i owe on a new credit card.  such a cheesy ripoff, and they need better editors.  lunch, and back to work =P

      my laptop decided to be retarded this morning, so i've been working on my desktop in my room... with the windows open because it's a gorgeous day!  but riddle me this...  there are two kids, who i'd guess to be junior high age, on the playground outside my window.  they've (both of them boys) got their shirts off and are using them to scoop up large amounts of gravel and throw it all down the slide  for as much as i enjoy playgrounds, this is one activity i've never really understood... and i'm getting tired of the gravel grating on metal sound...   blah... up to 296 -- for sure i'll hit 350 today, 400 if i'm lucky... wish me luck!

      ok, well i *do* sit on my couch all day watching movies and old sitcoms while i work, but still... i am earning my keep... worked 10 hours yesterday and 8 hours today (just got done), and i'm not even 1/4 of the way done with this project.  background: i'm supposed to find 1000 prospective sponsors for hunting expos in the mid-south.  yesterday i exhausted what they expected to be my primary resource and had only 144 contacts to show for it.  today, they gave me more places to search and suddenly decided they wanted mailing addresses and phone numbers saved as well as email addresses (all that they wanted before), so it takes a little longer to input.  it's not like it's a difficult job... i open company websites, find the contact info page (or snoop around the html code for forms to get email addresses =P), and copy and paste into an excel spreadsheet... if you can turn on a computer, you can do my job... it's just tedious and time-consuming.  the funny thing is, carolyn (my boss) thought monday night that she'd have at most 8-10 hours of work for me each week, and here i am working 8-10 hours/day and will be working some on weekends to get this done by the end of next week if at all possible.  oh well, so now you know what i do =P  can't ask for much better when you can only work for 4 weeks... and my boss thinks i'm excellent :-)  watching pleasantville on TBS... i haven't seen it in a few years and i think the last time i saw it was before i was aware of who reese whitherspoon is... it's cute... staying up til it's done and crashing. =P  later dudes. =P

      well at least news and drinks, but whatever =P  two links i stole from two friends blogs -- but i don't think anyone else knows the both of them, so there's something new for everyone :-)  (1)  "For Some, the Blogging Never Stops"  (from the New York Times last week) -- maybe i write a lot, but i don't write in here in *place* of social interaction =P  (2)  pop vs. soda (vs. coke)  -- see the country in a whole new way =)  it's 12:30 and all i've done today is finish reading the copy of  mental floss magazine  that i picked up in ohio on my last roadtrip... need to track down the june/july issue soon... lunch then starting to work -- ah, the life of a telecommuter is glorious =)

      strange dream:  was at valpo... went to bacclaureate, was talking with lots of friends outside the chapel afterwards when suddenly everyone starts herding over to the ARC (gym)... i had rutgers people there, pittsburgh cousins i was walking with, etc., etc., etc.  i couldn't figure out why on earth everyone was headed for the arc so i took a detour in the direction of guild/memorial (2 of the dorms) and instead there were 1-story apartments... i went in the one i was apparently staying in with friends, and headed towards a room in the back, and lo and behold it was my room here in jersey... i started working on the computer and got a music file sent to me on IM from an online friend i've never met but have been chatting with on and off for like 5-6 years now... while i was still downloading it, there was a knock at the door and it was that same online friend... never met him ever before... asked him how on earth he got here (IN? NJ?) from AZ, and he claimed that it was on the way to moving back to CA... go figure.  we went to some weird modern art museum "in valpo" but my head made it up... it was bizarre... i realized halfway through that the place was relatively empty compared to normal because everyone else in town was in the ARC for graduation and i had been too confused to go, then i remembered i had seen all those people graduate 2-3 weeks previously, so i was missing a repeat and it wasn't as bad as i felt, but i still felt silly.  then i made some comment to brett (online friend that appeared) that "like dude, you're the 2nd long-time internet friend i've run into for the first time this weekend" and woke up.  nothing exciting... just i find it fascinating how many different aspects of my life get combined in dreams and how fluidly they move from one place to another, whereas the sudden jump from chapel drive in valpo to my room in jersey should have raised red flags, and yet it doesn't... mostly i'm just fascinated by how our heads put dreams together.  the end.

      mason (friend from my budapest semester who lives in columbia, SC) just called.  i hadn't talked to him in over a month or so... he wanted directions from the NJ turnpike to a particular liquor store near campus for a friend of his who's coming up to jersey this weekend.  that super-important business taken care of, he filled me in on what he's up to and what half a dozen other people are up to, got the scoop on my life lately, told me i still need to come visit, and with as many people as i can fit in my car that he knows forced to come along, and then end of conversation.  my friends crack me up.  yay for all of you. =)

      so somehow i got myself volunteered to give an hour talk to the rutgers math REU (research experience for undergrads) kids the day after my birthday -- oh joy.  not the most excited, but if i just re-give my pizza seminar talk from march i think it'll be ok.  must write abstract tonight.  just got back from my one people interaction of the day =P  i worked 8 hours, made dinner, then went over to mike's (jared's house where mike and jared lived all year -- where all the 1st year math guys will be next year) to pick up my plants... we had a long discussion about plants, travels, work, and the people we both know around here... fun fun.  jessica has saturday free! so it looks like we'll finally get in our rain check to see "mean girls"... it's only been a week, but such a long one at that =P  i've invited amanda, we shall see if she comes. =)  going to work a bit more, then read myself to sleep again.  joy =P  later dudes.

      i've been working hard today... 10-6 already and plan to be going for awhile yet... i made oatmeal at 11, ate about half and then have been too busy to finish until half an hour ago.. dinner much later. joy.  i just got a telemarketing call... that by itself is ok... the girl was like "you've been entered in a sweepstakes, let me ask these questions..." about if i was single or married, how old i am, etc.  i listened to her schpiel patiently, then she started telling me all these things i could have for free plus a discounted magazine subscription "for the low price of $3.45 a week!... now let me tell you lara, just about everyone we've called today has said yes, it's a great offer", and when i said "sorry, but i'm going to have to say no", she hung up on me.  i had been nice and polite to her, knowing what it's like to be on the other end of the phone and she just hung up on me... i was glad to be done with the conversation, but how extremely rude!  back to work.

      pet peave: people who would rather leave notes and hide than talking to you  i woke up this morning with a note on the kitchen table saying "lara, bathroom's dirty, why don't you clean it today?  thanks!" (1) as if i can't see the bathroom to evaluate it myself (2) i was around most of last night... there were a whole 4 hours i was home and just working in front of the TV while amanda was home that instead of shutting herself in her room she could have come out and said a word or two  maybe i'm just griping over nothing... next month i'll be gone most of the time anyhow, so after june there's not much interaction with her left; so it's not really worth the fuss.  even if i don't talk to her much either, i do leave my door open and say hi and ask her how she's going when she comes in, and when i have had something to say, i've made an effort to say it in person, even if it takes a few shots to actually do it.  yeah, not a big deal; just started off my morning with a slightly annoyed mood.  gotta have 200 prospective sponsor emails to my boss before i go to sleep tonight... on with the work! (today's work in your PJs day =)  )

      today made me a lot more happy about how the summer is looking like it'll be.  yesterday i was worried about entertaining myself, but today worked out alright.  (1) i have work to do.  i've started on this database of outdoors expo sponsors, and it's good to have something constructive to do with my time.  in fact, having the system i do with carolyn (my boss) makes even being employed this summer feel like even less work than last summer... apparently here's how it's going to work.  carolyn outlines a job to me along with her estimate of how long it should take and how much pay that's worth. i email her back with either an acceptance of the task or challenge the amount of time (kinda like bargaining) and ask anything else i want to know about the job... then she gives me final details and a deadline for the client and then i just have to get done... e.g. i have til next week wednesday (a week from tomorrow) to finish this database of outdoors sponsors; meanwhile instead of working 9-5 i can have a day like today: i was tired from not sleeping night before last so i stayed in bed til 9:30, worked til 11:30, got breakfast and got ready, saw a movie with ben, worked from 5-7:30, then sarah showed up at my door and we went out to dinner and i just got home...  footnotes: *the movie ben and i saw was hilarious... i don't want to say too much because i don't want to unsurprise any of you who might by chance read this and look into seeing it.  it was an indian film (like made in india and with subtitles) and truly has about something for everyone... you have to go in with an open mind stylistically though -- 15 minutes in the other 3 people in the theater left, whereas ben and i stayed til the end and greatly enjoyed it!  name of the movie?  main hoon na (which apparently means "i'm here now" from the many times it was said and translated) =P  conclusion: if it's in your area, see it soon and then laugh with me about it -- it's worth the ticket price... if it's not in your area, ask me about it; it's one of a kind!  *i said dinner with sarah... sarah's a 2nd year student who lives in hoboken (much nearer to NYC than here).  she has a book of mine she meant to return but forgot it on her way out earlier, so she stopped by anyhow to tell me so... i settled down to work then, and 2.5 hours later she came back by "so, have you eaten yet?"... she had a taste for olive garden, so we went, did the whole dinner, appetizer, wine, dessert deal, and chatted for 2 hours... she commented that she likes hanging out with me b/c i'm less threatening than most people in the department -- that she can have a long quality conversation with me without starting to talk about people/things in the math department and she likes that.  it was fun.  so yeah, interaction with people is key, and so is having something constructive to do... and go see "main hoon na"! =P  later dudes, i'm back to work

      in a word cirque du soleil last night was absolutely amazing!  my description won't do it justice... i'll have to see about scanning in photos from the program or something.... the whole show was water based, i.e. the stage was a semicircle pool that got shallower or deeper depending on what was going on -- sychronized swimmers in really cool costumes, fire jugglers, high divers, trapeze artists, you name it... like i said, my description won't do it justice!  arlene and her boyfriend adam got her last night just in time for supper -- they walked the strip while eric and i were at the show... it's so good to see her again!  and he's a pretty nice friendly guy to hang out with for the day now too (as if someone arlene was seeing wouldn't be :-P)... yay for semester abroad reunions after a year and a half! :-)  this is my last stop i'll have internet for awhile... in the meantime you can think of me oohing and aahing at the following stops along the way :-P  today: finish packing eric's car, drive all 4 of us (me, eric, arlene, adam) in 2 cars from vegas to north rim of the grand canyon, possibly camp for the night, at least definitely see sunset!  friday: leave arlene and adam to enjoy the canyon... drive from grand canyon to salt lake city, see the salt lake, stay with eric's REU roommate drew in salt lake  saturday: drive from salt lake to yellowstone (new states on the way include idaho and montana :-) ), hopefully be there at the right time to see old faithful... at least be there to enjoy the park itself... stay somewhere around cody, WY probably.  sunday: drive from WY to rapid city, SD, see mount rushmore, stay in SD  monday: drive from SD to minneapolis, MN... stay with michelle collins!  and the fun only continues from there, but that will get told another time :-P  an excellent week to you all! =)

      i think i just ruined an 8-year-old's outlook on life... eric's sorting out stuff for packing the car, so there's not much to help with... so i'm entertaining myself and got on yahoo games to play a game of checkers...   ended up playing a rather chatty 8-year-old from buffalo, NY, who, when she discovered that i was nearly 3 times her age, got pretty proud of herself... i made a few dumb moves early on, that got us to 4 kings on my side versus 6 kings on her side... she kept telling me how cool it was she was "creaming" a 23-year old in checkers, and that i should "hurry up and get it over with"... i told her just because she was 8 didn't mean i was just giving up and "letting" her win... shortly thereafter she jumped one of my pieces and didn't see that that gave me a TRIPLE jump... 3 kings vs. 3 kings, i beat her rather quickly.  eric says she's going to grow up and be a criminal now even though i told her she played excellently and that it was a good game.  doht!  back to being a putz :-P

      soooo, so much for the thermometer... today had other plans for us.  we started out headed for california -- the state line is just 30 miles south of vegas on I-15.  at the state line is buffalo bill's casino, which has a crazy roller coaster... apparently when it was built, it had the steepest drop of any roller coaster in the world or something... it was pretty crazy, going through tunnels and up and down faster crazy turns and drops... it was a rush to start the day :-)  next, we planned to drive the 45 minutes into cali to see the world's largest thermometer, but got caught in bad traffic and decided to turn back and do other things -- at least i was in the state? :-P, even if i did nothing but look at it and get caught in traffic -- then again bad traffic, that's california-y right? ;-P  soooo, having not seen the thermometer, we headed for the other nearby state -- arizona... we parked on the nevada side of the state line and walked across hoover dam, taking pictures of the colorado river, the dam, and lake mead -- mighty mighty impressive! :-P  that done, we headed into town -- went to the bellagio for a bit and admired their conservatory, picked up our tickets for tomorrow night, and watched the fountain show at 6 and at 6:30 -- absolutely incredible! :-)  finally, after dinner, (mexican fast food), we went to a local club where eric's brother marc's band (the quitters), had their first gig... it was a lot of fun... even eric's 80ish year old grandma came, with ear plugs, but with a huge smile on her face.... that woman's already giving *me* hugs every time i see her, it's great :-)  tomorrow, not quite as exciting til later in the evening -- eric does have to pack after all :-P however, there will be fun too... arlene, of budapest semesters fame, and her boyfriend adam are coming down from seattle and meeting us at eric's place around dinner time... we'll say hi and then leave them because we've (eric and me) had reserved tickets for "O", the current cirque du soleil show at the bellagio for months, whereas they decided to meet up with us about 2 weeks ago :-P... after we're back, sleep time, then the four of us head out on day one of actual roadtripping :-P  woohah!  the great out west = lots of fun :-)  later dudes :-P

      re: the title -- eric always kids me that i have the country divided into 4 or 5 categories: "midwest", "out east" "new england", and most importantly "the grand old south" and "the great out west"... unfortunately for most of the country, all the places i'd never been before this week are all lumped into the "great out west" category :-P&nbsp; nonetheless, eric plays along with my classification system so it sticks :-P  &nbsp;  last night was entertaining... eric's family's back yard is about the level of the roof of the house behind them, so it's an excellent viewing platform for the city... last night we watched the sun set over the mountains, and then eric's mom made dinner, which we also ate outside watching the cities light up for the night... beautiful... eric's family is hilarious though:&nbsp; eric's dad is pretty quiet and laid back; he's a palentology professor at university of nevada -- las vegas... i can't ever picture him being mad or loud about anything; just very pleasant... eric's mom is a lot of fun; but a lot more excitable than his dad, is always talking to everybody and halfway fussing that everything goes according to plan-- and then there's eric and his siblings... while eric has the science thing going on and is pretty quiet at school in groups of people, with his family he can be pretty animated (as he can be with just a person or two he knows well, so not a surprise -- just entertaining to see him be more outgoing here :-P)... he is all about science and into classical music and nature stuff.... his brother marc (exactly one day younger than my brother) is complete opposite of eric... they look like brothers but beyond that... dude... marc is part of a punk band -- their first gig is tonight somewhere downtown; marc is much louder and much more of a party-er than eric, and just has completely opposite interests.... finally, eric's sister rachael, who's going to be a high school senior this year, is into country music, works as a life guard, has a lot of common personality aspects with her mom, and is good at being a girl (i would say i'm not good at being a girl, whatever that means :-P)... anyhow, long story short... put all these 5 people together with arielle (a girl from AZ who marc knows from his semester in israel a couple years ago) and me... where everyone is jewish except me = highly entertaining dinner.  &nbsp;  after dinner, marc and arielle went to see blue man group; rachael went to sleep, and eric and me took out his telescope -- looking away from the city, we could actually see the milky way!&nbsp; we also found messier objects M6, M7, M8, and M22 -- 6,7, and 22 are open star clusters (places in the sky that look dark/hazy to the naked eye but are places lots of stars are forming and can be seen with a telescope/binoculars)... M6 actually looks kinda like the outline of a bug with wings outstretched -- really cool!&nbsp; M8 is a nebula -- although it's redish tinted in star magazines, it's just kinda gray through the telescope. :-P&nbsp; nonetheless, we were excited and had a blast with it. :-)  &nbsp;  we got home late, and now it's california day!&nbsp; obviously since it's just an hour away, i have to go to the border to say i was there, and beyond that, just to say we did something we can only do in california, we're going to baker to see  urlLink this  , the world's largest thermometer -- to make it more exciting for eric, who's seen it many times before, we're getting greek food for lunch too while we're there, and then heading back...  &nbsp;  more casino stuff tonight, to be followed by marc's aforementioned gig. :-P&nbsp; party, eh?  &nbsp;  later dudes! :-) look, out cali, here i come ;-P

      here i am!!! :-P... flew in after a very long day yesterday, had pecan pie with eric's parents and sister, and then crashed... yay for 3 hour time changes? &nbsp; today was a blast though :-) &nbsp; first off, eric had a hair appointment so i sat around and waited whole he had that... then we went to red rock canyon -- it's in the mountains around vegas... with several places to stop off and go rock climbing... we saw some petrogliphs (ancient rock writings) in the mountains and climbed up one large stone/mini mountain there called "the quarry"... long and hot but the view was INCREDIBLE!... on the way out of the park, a burro (think mexican donkey) was by the road and when eric opened the window to take its picture it stuck its head in to try to lick me!&nbsp; craziness! &nbsp; then, after going to in and out (one of eric's favorite "out west" burger places) for lunch, we hit the strip... i spent about $3 on quarter slots and got about $2 back :-)... that's about my gambling limit... we visited mgm grand, excalibur, luxor, new york new york, and then the m&amp;m shop... it was fun. :-)&nbsp; eric also beat me in a close game of air hockey but he claims he earned it after never ever beating me in reversi all last fall.&nbsp; nonetheless, fun times all around :-P &nbsp; here's the final random factoid of the day... last night over pie with eric's family, and hearing my dad's family is from south of chicago, eric's dad pulled a drawing off the wall of mr. and mrs. byron mckinstry and their farm in grank park, kankakee county, illinois... when i commented that grant park's where i was born and lived until i was 5 years old, they were all excited... mckinstry was eric's great-great-great-great-grandfather who went to california in 1850 for the gold rush, made it big, then went back to grant park to build this huge farm....&nbsp;when i called the parents an hour ago and asked them if the name mckinstry meant anything to them my dad blurted out " the  byron mckinstry farm??? that's right at the 1/17 split... everyone knows that"... soooo, detour on the trip next week to take pictures of this farm i've passed everytime i've driven between g-ma pudwell's and valpo in the past 4 years and not thought anything of until today... it's a small world after all... :-P &nbsp; time to develop lots of pictures and go party some more :-) &nbsp; oh and p.s.... eric's family moved this spring to a new house, and on the pull out couch i have the best panoramic view of the vegas valley all lit up and the mountains :-)&nbsp; so even when i wake up at 4/5am (7/8 jersey time) i have lots of awesome things to look at :-) &nbsp; yeah, party time -- later dudes! :-)

      dude... i sure hope eric doesn't get tired of me in the next 2 weeks... i've been what he would call "giddy" since i got&nbsp;back from memphis... just all excited about this trip... lara being excited = lara doesn't sleep = especially later in the day, lara doesn't make mmuch sense... but it's a bouncing off the walls, can't contain excitement kind of doesn't make sense... we shall see. &nbsp; i slept 6.5 hours... waking up a few times inbetween to see if it was 6:30 yet... the plan: &nbsp; woke up 6:30am eastern/3:30am pacific church @ 8am eastern/5am pacific ben picks me up for the drive to the airport 11am eastern/8am pacific i fly out of newark at 2pm eastern/11am pacific insert 3.5 hour layover in chicago land in vegas at midnight eastern/9pm pacific &nbsp; bound to be a long but highly entertaining day! :-) &nbsp; later dudes :-)

      in order to not get a ticket (it's now illegal to talk on the phone whil driving in jersey unless you have a handsfree device), lara just purchased one of said handsfree devices...  &nbsp; dilemma 1: lara is so used to talking with and playing with her phone while talking that it's going to be quite the effort to remember to use said hand free device &nbsp; dilemma 2:&nbsp; lara charged this, as she's doing with most of her life this summer on account of not really getting paid for july and august... money makes me sad :-(

      man... what a 2 days... &nbsp; wednesday night (1) it pouring down rain at precisely the moment i started to load my car, (2) my brother having time for the first night all week for a sonic slush run and joyriding for a bit, and (3) several interesting IM conversations i got myself into late at night, i didn't go to sleep until 1am... then in an effort to get on the road early enough to get to pittsburgh before my younger cousins' usual 9:30 bedtime, i woke up at 4:30, and drove 14 hours on 3.5 hours of sleep... yes, it took me 14 freakin hours to make the trip... (usually it takes 12.5) because on I-71 between lousiville, KY and cincinnati, OH they had everyone merge into one lane and then stopped all traffic for a bit so a gravel truck could go back and forth across the road to fill in the shoulder with said gravel... sitting in park on the interstate for an hour when you're ready to fall asleep already and have at least 6 hours of driving to go yet... yeah, i was not so happy. &nbsp; on the other hand, besides that, and seeing one of the worst wrecks ever between harrisburg and allentown, PA today (a suburban with a mobile home on the back had tumbled over several times, and both parts were on their sides/upside down with several other cars off the road as a result of the fray), it was a good trip... beautiful weather the whole way through... about 10 minutes of rain total, and a certain friend of mine just calls every so often now to see how life is going and make me laugh :-) &nbsp; so indeed... that's the scoop... 1 day to let my energy level recuperate, and then i'm off and running again! &nbsp; more tales to come, i'm sure :-P &nbsp; later dudes :-)

      current temp? 100F current heat index? 129F  oh joy oh joy... and in spite of that, yours truly spent most of the afternoon outside...dude  dentist appointment this morning -- no cavities and i still get to keep my wisdom teeth -- that's always good news :-)  then, lunch @ dixie cafe w/ mom, which always makes me happy :-)  then, vaccuumed and dusted inside my car, and washed and waxed the outside... taking frequent water breaks on account of the heat, this added up to 3-4 hours of work and now i'm exceedingly yucky :-P...  but such things must be done on the one week per six months i have a driveway to do them in, eh? ;-)  cleaning up, packing, and going to Bible study @ doc sohn's, then hopefully out by 5 (central) in the morning... 12.5 hours to pittsburgh and i lose an hour with time zones... blah.  later dudes :-P

      what's better than just having a cool funny boss who likes me and makes me free lunches? -- getting to swim in her pool after work!  today it got up to 99 with a heat index of 119 in my part of town... craziness... however, at 4pm, when we were done working, we headed outside and swam for 2 hours -- it felt great!  i hadn't had a chance to swim since last year!  done working for the summer... tomorrow's dentist appointment, packing, lunch with mom, and Bible study @ Doc Sohn's before i head back to jersey thurs and fri..  time to be a bum for once... later dudes :-P

      got this email this morning from my 4th grade teacher and laughed my head off:  "With all the sadness and trauma going on in the world at the moment it is worth reflecting on the death of a person which almost went unnoticed last week.  Larry LaPrise, the man who wrote "The Hokey Pokey" died peacefully at the age of 93.  The most traumatic part for his family was getting him into the coffin.  They put his left leg in.  And then the trouble started."  (it's a joke... laprise really died in '96 at age 83 as per  http://www.fff.at/2002/03/02/hokey-pokey-creator/ , but whatever)  in other news: current memphis weather?  temperature of 97F, heat index of 118F.. calling cotton farmers for 3 more hours, then going swimming!  woohoo!  later dudes :-P

      man, even if telemarketing stinks, i have the funniest boss ever :-)  2 stories from today: today, her 5 year old joshua mostly hung out downstairs playing with his matchbox cars and watching cartoons, but he came upstairs to the office at one point and said his nose hurt.  carolyn (my boss) didn't see anything wrong, but to make him "feel better", she put a bandaid on it... she didn't feel like going downstairs and all she had upstairs was a huge butterfly bandaid that covered his whole nose!  everytime he came back up to say hi and went away we laughed for 10-15 minutes about how funny he looked with a bandaid he didn't really need on his face :-P  heh :-P  story 2... halfway through the afternoon, carolyn all the sudden jumped up and said "hey let's watch the garbage men out the window"... explaining... there was a big thunderstorm last week that threw their pool furniture all over the place... apparently something hit their neighbor's cat because after the storm, they found him dead under their swimming pool... they put him in a garbage bag in the trash (this part is sad, i agree) and he'd been there for 4 days in the 90+ degree heat and humidity, so it stank pretty bad out front... she wanted to watch their faces as they dealt with throwing the trash into the garbage truck... that got us laughing for another 20 minutes -- dude!  so yeah, i have a humorous boss ;-)  more data entry fun tonight after checking email and prolly going to starbucks with mom for a bit :-P... then again every night but one since i've been back in town, travis has called me to talk for awhile, so it's really more a factor of how much i get done before he calls rather than how much i get done before i crash ;-)  later dudes :-P

      watching the news tonight, there was a blurb about west nile virus since 5 memphis zip codes have had animals test positive for it this summer again...  normally when they talk to someone on TV you see their name, and then a subtitle with what they do or where they work...  e.g. "rick pudwell -- memphis botanic garden" or "joe smith -- concerned neighbor"  today, one lady they had on had the best subtitle ever:  "terry walker -- duck eats mosquitoes"  ai yai yai  later dudes :-P

      ... or international space station in the sky with jupiter... same difference, right?  ok, not really the same, but i did indeed see the space station tonight!  it made a big arc to the west for a little under 10 minutes around 9:30 tonight... it was on the news earlier, and i got to a good break point with data entry for work about 10 minutes before it rose, so i made a point of going outside to see! :-)  other exciting events of the day?  after church and lunch today, the family went to the wonders exhibit downtown (see  www.wonders.org )... wonders exhibits are travelling museum exhibits that hit memphis for 6 months at a time... they generally get one per year... this year was the history and estate of the medici family of italy... pretty cool... my favorites were a case of math tools, and a case of astronomy tools the belonged to galileo.... of interest to my fellow lutherans, pope leo, who excommunicated luther was a medici so i got to see the papal bull that actually did that... also of interest to valpo CC people, i got to actually see part of a fresco painted by giotto, since he was from the time and place of the orginal family line of medicis and they sponsored his students some too... in summary, it was a cool exhibit!  so yeah, then the space station, and a good chat with roommate, and lots of data entry... and more data entry to come before i sleep =P  later dudes!

      i was a complete and total putz all day yesterday... slept til lunchtime, wasted time online, read a bit, did word puzzles, developed pictures (more llamas  here  :-P ), and finally, brother and me went to see a movie: king arthur.  i don't like bloody/battle movies very much, but i enjoyed this one... it was more centered on the relationships between people rather than on "let's see how much blood/gore we can make"... so somehow that made it more watchable for me... guinevere kicked butt too :-P  all in all, enjoyed it and glad we went.  now, went to the traditional church service with dad already this morning, and in an hour am going to the contemporary service with my brother (mom plays organ/keyboard for both and the guys both just go to one or the other)... this is one thing i love about good shepherd that's weird here... both services have the same worship style each particular week, but both services rotate between different worship styles and liturgy sources... there's not this chasm of "contemporary people" and "traditional people" like even just in my family... blah.  more this evening... later dudes! =P

      summary of my day:  *called cotton farmers for 3.5 hours -- well, really 3, and entertained my bosses 5 year old for half an hour while she was on a conference call and didn't want him playing in the background =P  *lunch with alissa (anderson) homes, ... we went to school together K-8 and she's now married 2 years, lives in mississippi and works as the district secretary for a clothing store chain... me, well i'm me... so we both get together once a year or so and ask lots of questions over lunch about what the other is doing, and then go our separate ways again :-)  *passed vehicle inspection!  i hate memphis vehicle inspection... mostly because of the brake test... put your car in drive, pull up the emergency brake and then stomp on the gas... and your car isn't supposed to go anywhere???  it's ridiculous... for once, i passed the first time through -- after sitting for an hour waiting in line in the 90+ degree heat without air conditioning (to get better emissions scores)... at least it's done, eh?  *another hour of cotton farmer calling  ...and now i'm home to do data entry... fun, eh?  later dudes :-P

      so, i must say, for hating telemarketing with a passion, today was relatively decent... mostly because i have the most awesome boss ever!  the short version: "hi, this is lara calling from cotton grower magazine... do you still want to recieve our free publication for the coming year?  are you a grower or a ginner?  how many acres of cotton do you have for production?  how many bales did you harvest last year?  we're weird and are required by law to ask random questions: what's your mother's middle name?" multiply by 250, and you have my day.  on the other hand, allow me to describe my work situation ;-)... i work for  SD4JC , a memphis business that consists entirely of my boss, and then me and this other girl ashley (ashley's same age as me) that help carolyn (my boss) out on occasion... she works out of her house with her 5 year old kid playing around all day... one large bedroom of the house is just set up with 5 large desks and 4 computers and a dry erase board for work.  benefits: it's just me and my boss, so no business casual to worry about, just whatever we feel like showing up in for the day... my boss hates outbound calling as much as me, so we take a break like every hour on the hour to run around the house... she makes me lunch for free, and i'm free to use her pool after work if i'd like.  no complaints on that!  now, i have data entry to do tonight at my leisure... extra $$ -- again no complaints here!  in conclusion, phone calling quotes of the day:  (it was great b/c we called alabama and arkansas people today and i had to pick up a drawl quick to be understood by some of them, which i do subconsciously... still haven't quite figured out how that works... but party and a half :-P)  the quotes:  me: or, I can talk to someone else in the family. callee: no you can't -- no one else here wants to talk to you. (click)  me: hi, may i speak to (insert name) wife of person i was supposed to call: honey, he's a farmer; he don't come inside.  me: how many bales of cotton does your husband have for production this year? callee: sure as heck i dunno -- a LOT of it!  me: so, to verify that i talked to you and renewed your subscription over the phone, our auditing bureau requires that we ask an identifying question: what's your mother's middle name? callee: oh, i know that one!  last time it was "what color are your husband's eyes?" and i felt silly that i sure didn't know!  time to get back to work ;-P  later dudes!

      since my drive home, that song (counting crows, accidentally in love) has been in my head -- it was in shrek 2 monday night, and it's been on the radio a lot... doht!  anyhow, today was my "free" day since work starts tomorrow...   lots of errands... developed photos from six flags saturday, 4th of july fun on sunday, and of the drive back... unfortunately although the scanner on the family computer is respectable, the dial up connection coupled with ftp to the rutgers servers completely stinks so it's gonna take forever and a day to upload things... look forward to it. :-P  it's recently come to my attention that i have an extremely eclectic variety of friends.... look at my memphis friends, my valpo friends, my rutgers friends, my internet friends, my international friends -- they constitute a great variety of people... today further illustrates that -- i spent 2 hours visiting my friend shannon... shannon is a 40 something mother of 1 (her kid is going to be a high school senior this fall)... she used to go to my church and was the leader of the flute quartet i was in at the end of high school.  despite the fact that she's closer to my mom's age than mine, that she and her family left our church years ago for one closer to their house, and that i'm no longer in town, she's one of the most faithful people at emailing me regularly, and i went over to her house to just to chat for awhile, leaving because i had somewhere else to get to on time... she's not even like buddy buddy with my parents (they get along fine)... she's MY friend and she's their age =P... in summary, it was a good chat, and yay for friends :-)  i like the fact that i have really a wide variety of friends -- interest wise, age wise, background wise... etc. :-)  makes life all the more fun :-)  after hanging out at shannon's for awhile, mom, ryan, and i went to hear pastor mike's presentation.  pastor mike (my memphis pastor) goes regularly on short term mission trips... end of may/early june he was with a team of people going to tanzania from the mid south district of the lcms (lutheran church--missouri synod) to talk with people and help finish building a new church building in progress... he talked for an hour, sharing pictures from his time there and it was pretty cool, although some things he commented on as sooo strange to him aren't that peculiar to africa so much as non-america :-P, or even to non-memphis :-P  nonetheless, it was a cool presentation.  now, as is typical, 9:15 and the family isn't ready to eat dinner yet... and it's 10:15 jersey time... ai yai yai -- this is another reason i don't regret not living here all the time! :-P  later dudes :-P

      well, not walkin per se yet, but i'm here!  what a couple of days...  yesterday was fine... drove from jersey to pitt with no unexpected delays -- got a box of peaches at a farmers market on the way -- quite tasty... only aunt priscilla and step-cousin danelle were in town, so once i got there the 3 of us went out for dinner and saw shrek 2, and there was an extra scene at the end that i didn't remember from the first time through, so it was a party :-)  today was the entertaining day -- i got out of aunt priscilla's half an hour later than planned, then headed straight for columbus  there, i met up with travis (aka black death)... he was pretty much as expected... between having a picture of him, and having talked to him quite a bit on the phone in the past week, it was just fun to merge the voice and the picture and interact with him in person... we met at a cracker barrel just south of the city and chatted for an hour and a half before i headed further south... he also gave me 2 CDs (one is savatage (precursor to transsiberian orchestra (you know their carol of the bells/christmas eve sarjevo song whether you think you do or not), and the other he wouldn't say who it was -- i really liked it,... and i looked it up online... tracks 1-14 are  zakk wylde  -- book of shadows but there's a few on the end, and i really want to know who tracks 16 and 17 are because they didn't seem to fit stylistically with the rest of the disc... halfway wondering if they're him playing or not... we shall see..  anyhow, after lunch i travis called again mandating i give him my reviews of the CDs :-P, scott called to say hi, and eric called to tell me he finally has a car!  party indeed :-)  by the time the two CDs ran out, i hit major crazy rain around louisville, kentucky... i.e. even with wipers on the fastest setting i couldn't see the car in front of me for awhile, and lightning hit so close to the road once i could feel the ground shake.  that survived, i was so pleased to make a pit stop in bowling green, kentucky (just barely north of the TN border) and talk to people with genuine southern accents... no matter how long you've been gone, the first real "southern" stop, is the best ever :-)  also passed the oscar meier weiner mobile on I-65 in central kentucky and was greatly amused :-)  as i crossed into TN i got a rainbow overhead from the passing storms... skirted around nashville fine and watched sunset as i headed west, however, as soon as the sun was gone, this huge dome-shaped cloud formed over jackson/memphis.... it looked like a mountain in the distance only the land is mostly flat and you could see lightning flashing through it every few seconds -- i drove towards that without being IN the storm for an hour and a half before i finally hit it -- it was amazing to watch!  too bad you can't time taking pictures with when lightning takes off!  anyhow, the 45 minutes of storm to my front door survived, my stuff is in the house, and i have a bunch of people to call :-P  night y'all!

      today was quality indeed.  after church, i worked on packing for my trip to memphis, and then helped scott start his move from the dorms on campus to the house where he, john, eric, mike, sam, and jared will be in the fall... in return he promised me a drink on him later. -- party indeed :-)  after a little more work at my place, jessica came up from philly, helped me bring a load of stuff down to my car, and then we watched the 2nd half of "ferris bueller's day off" before scott got back home from playing basketball..   he, ben, jessica and i went to applebees for munchies and drinks -- i got a mucho mudslide, on scott because he's a party :-)  then, we picked up colleen and headed for highland park... (where i'll live in a month) :-) -- they had a local band called "deSol" what was pretty fun... scott and ben juggled and played with my hackeysack and made some small children friends while jessica and i worked on making clover flower jewelry; jessica made herself a crown, and i made a necklace that scott volunteered to wear before i even finished... with him wearing it and continuing to play with his small children friends, i ended up being a flower necklace factory and making them for all scott's new 4 foot tall friends :-)  ben and me also got glow-sticks and had fun waving them around until fireworks started :-)  and they were fun... actually, highland park didn't set any off -- they just set everyone up facing the fireworks from the town across the river (new brunswick) which is a little over... trees blocked the lower ones, but the high up ones, which were 80% of the show, were fantastic! :-) it was a party :-)  now, i'm back home, and should ponder getting some sleep before the roadtrip tomorrow :-)  jersey to pittsburgh tomorrow, pittsburgh to memphis on tuesday, via columbus for lunch with travis -- catch y'all on the flip side :-)

      not a cheesy post title, -- that's the six flags park we attacked yesterday, and man was it fun!  you'd expect going on a holiday weekend on one of the most perfect weather days of the year we'd have spent the day waiting in line the whole time, but not so much :-P  ben, scott, and me met up at 10:30... waited for sarah to join, but she never showed, so we headed the 1.5 hours away to six flags great adventure (jackson, NJ)... me and scott and ben... trouble :-P  my first priority was to go on a ride that goes upside down (really this isn't hard to do :-P,  it just meant we needed to hit up a rollercoaster first... =) )... anticipating long lines, we were surprised when we waited all of 10 minutes before getting to ride the "scream machine"... best part is -- i didn't scream... i laughed the whole time and ben (who was sitting next to me) wondered if there was something wrong with me as a result =P  after that, we rode superman... this ride took more of a 45 minute wait and i was nearly scared still to ride it once we got close... you get in the seat, hands, and legs free in the air, and just before the ride takes off they tilt everyone's seats so that your back is straight up in the air, and you're hanging, face down, facing the ground... as we went up the initial incline, just hanging there (me between ben and scott this time) scott took advantage of me being afraid and was like "dude, lara, look, if this thing broke, look how far we'd fall -- we're all gonna DIE!!!!!!!"... i screamed like a girl the whole time, which greatly amused ben and scott (because i don't really do that very often), but it was a rush. =)  after lunch we played silly carnival games and ben won me a taz (tasmanian devil, of course :-) )... we rode the teacups almost of the point of turning our stomachs, and then the ferris wheel to get a better scope of what we still needed to hit, then did one of those boat rides that goes down a waterfall and gets you wet... after that scott and ben wanted to stand on the bridge that the water ride goes under, because that way you get even more drenched... they got soaked twice over before they dragged me over to get drenched too... of course, dripping wet, and absolutely soaked, we had to ride rollercoasters to dry off :-)...   after all that fun, we split a pizza 3 ways for dinner, making it certain we couldn't ride anymore crazy rides... so we spent awhile in the arcade, and ben and me got enough tickets out of the silly machines where you drop quarters and try to knock more down to get me a hackeysack, and then scott and me each scored high enough on skeeball to get ourselves stuffed frogs :-)... ben won himself a stuffed rottweiller to, so picture the 3 of us with a dog, a taz, two of us with sutffed frogs on our heads (rotating which two throughout the evening), running around quoting "go dog go" (i.e. "helllllloooooo!!!"  "helllooooooo!!!"  "how do you like my hat!?" "i do not like that hat goodbye!"  "goodbye") in stupid british accents and riding kiddie rides for an hour -- high on life is a good way to be :-) ... we rode the merry-go-round last of all because half the places to sit on there were chickens!  and ben had to ride a chicken...  after that fun, we had an hour til their fireworks display, so i got yarn weaved into my hair that i'm guessing will stay put til it falls out of its own accord... i picked blue and white and the guys insisted i had to get red with it, so my hair is patriotic now :-P  when i was done, we got good seats for the fireworks -- we didn't even realize that there would be fireworks until a worker on one of the rides told us... it was fantastic, all out holiday deal... they had quotes from all the presidents since the dawn of radio, and later made a screen by blowing up water from a fountain and projecting a screen onto that, of shots from the life of ronald reagan -- it was kinda cool... we oohed and ahhed... and 11 hours after getting there, we drove on home... and sang the whole hour plus back.... indeed, what a day.  now, today, i gotta get my packing done!  i'm on the road back down south in less than 24 hours and i'm not ready to go at all!  doht!  later dudes :-P

      so what's lara been up to lately (besides obsessing over how meeting an old online friend will actually go in person and taking oodles of online quizzes?)  here's the real deal:  reading, working (on math), and more reading mostly... 3 main trains of thought too, and my current reading falls into at least 2 of those categories :-P  (1) relationships -- my talking with travis (aka "black death") has gotten more frequent by a ton lately, and it's been lots of fun, but i've consequently been analyzing a lot of what makes particular friendships work -- and why exactly it's so much different to go from internet to phone to in person communication instead of the reverse order, which is more standard...  also, i think since i have some of nicole's stuff now, the repurcussions of her accident last september are hitting me more realistically... i've known that when i talked to her 10 months ago tomorrow, it was the last time in this life... that she's gone, and that i won't see her again, but with some of her possessions here, and the fact that it's been the better part of a year, i've realized the back of my head can't fool itself into "nicole's gone on a long trip somewhere where she doesn't have access to mail/phone/etc... she'll get back to the states and i'll hear from her eventually..." that's a chump explanation, but i think in some ways, up til recently, she's been away no longer than some other friends who have come back from working/travelling various other places, and now it's getting to the point i can't trick myself into dealing with it that way... especially since her parents sent the package of her stuff, which i got on the day of my birthday, i've been hit with periodic huge "i miss nicole" waves out of nowhere... yesterday was an especially hard one, and i seriously cried for like 2 hours... such is life i guess... it puzzles me what exactly sets me off sometimes, but i guess that i still miss her and her memory affects me that strongly just is all the more evidence that she was that special to me, right? ... and that can't have been a bad thing... patience with myself... that's the key  (2) math stuff -- i've been studying hard for quals since my birthday and getting frustrated a lot.  i've recently come to the conclusion that my personality is not well suited to mesh with the constraints of the first year or two of grad school... i will make it, because i'm stubborn and determined, and even more because i have great friends who encourage me and help keep me going, but i will be much more in my element when i can do research instead of studying tricky problems for a crazy test in 59 days when i don't test well anymore... it's a mind game of convincing myself i can handle the upcoming hurdles and stress to get to the point where i have the credentials to really do what i want to do with my life.  (3) i've been doing lots and lots of extra reading... and here's the proof that i'm really an academic... here's what i've read for "fun" lately...immediately after finishing  the millenium problems  (see this entry:  the millenium problems (what's going on with math and why you, who are friends of an aspiring mathematician, should care =P)  ), the next two things i've read cover to cover are:  (a) Astronomy magazine: Origin and Fate of the Universe, collector's edition   (b) time magazine -- june 21, 2004 issue   this is my thing lately... you'll notice that the next book i plan to start this week is called  the science of God .... astronomy was not a religious magazine in the least, but it's all about the science of what the universe looks like and how it behaves... the particular issue of Time i've been reading has the cover "faith, God, and the oval office"... lately i guess, i've been fascinated by the relationship between faith and science and how the two interact.  time wasn't so much about the science but how faith interacts with politics (plus it had a multi-page article about blogs ;-P) what what american society may or may not consider to be the appropriate interaction between the two.  i guess i've come into contact over the years with various shades of two distinct voices on the meshing of religion and science and i fall between the two.  (1) ultra conservative: the Bible says so and that's all i need to know... evolution, the big bang, etc., they're all people making up stuff to replace religion they don't want to believe in -- there are some things only God should know and science is pushing the limit  (2) ultra liberal: science is the one reliable way to explore the world-- you can't prove the claims religions make and they all have such fundamental issues; the lack of separation between church and state in this country scares me -- it's all the Christians trying to inflict their view on others and i want nothing of it.  i get so frustrated with both voices and am somewhere between the two.  mathematics isn't a laboratory science, but it is a science... it's the study of patterns in the world, and the way i see it, once of the few disciplines that can honestly claim to seek genuine irrefutable truth about the world around us... math proofs are not subject to needing experimental confirmation, they're not just theories -- they show us FACTS about the world...  one of the theorems that most fascinates me is Godel's theorem, which although i'm not a logic expert by far, says that in any system of axoims that uses arithmetic, there will always exist statements that are TRUE, but are NOT able to be proven from the given known axioms (i.e. "obvious" facts) about the system.  i like to read this as, no matter how much of what we know and scientifically prove about the world, just because one can't rig up an experiment and concretely prove the existence of God, this THEOREM leaves the necessary room -- the existence of God is one of those things that is entirely true, and not able to be verified by what we know and can get our hands on -- interesting, eh?  i'm done rambling and being preachy and whatever -- this is the food for thought on my mind lately -- starting  the science of God  this weekend, maybe even this afternoon, and more discussion of it as i hit on interesting points... in the meantime -- some quotes i like from  777 mathematical conversation starters  (see previous entry) relating to the above :-)  "There is more religion in men's science than there is science in their religion." ~Henry David Thoreau  "No longer is theology embarrassed by the contradiction between God's immanence and transcendence.  Hyperspace touches every point of three-space.  God is closer to us than our breathing.  He can see every portion of our world, touch every particle without moving a finger through our space.  Yet the Kingdom of God is completely "outside" of three-space, in a direction in which we cannot even point." ~Martin Gardner  "There are problems to whose solution I would attach an infinitely greater importance than those of mathematics, for example touching ethics, or our relation to God, or concerning our destiny and our future; but their solution lies wholly beyond us and completely outside the providence of science." ~Carl Friedrich Gauss  "Science and religion are both extremely important issues, but they do different things.  Science deals with the factual state of nature, and religion deals with ethics and meaning." ~Stephen J. Gould  "Every formula which expresses a law of nature is a hymn of praise to God. " ~Maria Mitchell, astronomer, first woman elected to the Amaerican Academy of Arts and Sciences  "Everyone who is seriuosly involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe -- a spirit vastly superior to that of man... in this way the pursuit of science leads to a religious feeling of a special sort, which is indeed quite different from the religiousity of someone more naive." ~Albert Einstein, letter to a child who asked if scientists pray  "Science without religion is lame; religion without science is blind." ~Albert Einstein  .... and what do you think? (as if any of you ever leave comments anymore anyhow ;-P)

      11pm: here's lara, being a bum and dozing off early  11:15pm: phone call with "unidentified number" on the caller ID -- i answer and seriously it sounds like marcus dugan (tammy's husband)... so i was entirely confused for a minute, but you guessed it -- travis, aka "black death"  we talked for the last hour that he was at work (he's a pizza chef :-P)... and for his drive home... and for a bit after... 2.5 hours in all.  it was highly entertaining despite the fact that i'm braindead and was nearly asleep when the conversation started  what does one talk about for 2.5 hours?  pizza... shoes... movies... ohio... gambling... more movies... tv... "hey here's a question that's more random than the last one you asked"... it was fun...  and if i type out the scott reaction now, then none of you will have to be ridiculous and say it "dude, 2.5 hours?  soo, you engaged yet?"... ha ha...  whatever, but at least now, i can stop worrying about how tuesday will go, because if we can have a quality chat for 2.5 hours (just before his phone died, BD was like "so, this is the longest intelligent conversation i've had in months -- thanks!"), we'll be fine for lunch.  anywho... i was going to crash 3 hours ago... maybe now i will for real -- night y'all. =P

BlkDeth 13: rofl BlkDeth 13: it was an empty threat. lkp 42 42 42: right now i'm about to fall asleep, seriously... just gotta wrap up like 3 conversations on IM here lkp 42 42 42: will we talk before we actually meet each other though? lkp 42 42 42: (phone is now off and charging for the night anyhow :-P) BlkDeth 13: i'll work on that.

      ben and me DID see spiderman 2 tonight... after i sat through "josie and the pussycats" on TV... partly it was on, partly i'd never seen it, mostly amanda claims she cancelled the cable so that today (june 30) was the last day, (even though it's still on now) so i figured i'd make use of the last bit of tv i have in the next month and a half.  before i get into spiderman though, random quote from an astronomy  magazine article i just read that i found funny, before i just go nuts w/ spiderman stuff: "consider the vexation in not knowing with certainty whether you are 3 feet tall or 6 feet tall, or that the distance from chicago to los angeles is 1,000 miles or 2,000 miles.  buying a new pair of slacks or planning this summer's road trip would be a guaranteed headache." (duuuude) :-P  anywho, ben came over for the last half hour of that, and then we saw spiderman... to capture the overall tone, immediately when the credits started rolling the first thing out of ben's mouth was "hey, let me do the 'lara is scared of the movie!' impression!"... he exaggerated, but it was pretty funny (i curl myself in a ball, and hide under my jacket)  really though, after seeing it i could understand why it's gotten such stellar reviews all around... although there were entire scenes i just closed my eyes from and paid attention again later, and there were several points where i just jumped and hid for a bit (much to ben's amusement), i enjoyed it,... the action was quality... the love story was believeable,... and other people were just plain funny.  in the end, it was a good movie... random quotes:  me: dude, what are you laughing at? ben: half naked tobey mcguire, that's what  isn't it time someone rescued you?  I believe there's a hero in all of us who keeps us honest, gives us strength, makes us noble, and finally allows us to die with pride, even though we have to be steady and give up the thing we want the most. Even our dreams.   there, be inspired.  night y'all.

      so, here's the scoop... i am exceedingly frustrated, stressed, sad, etc. this week... bad/frustrating situations in progress?  *keep roommate and her family (roommate = kristin, my valpo roommate, and one of my best friends ever) in your prayers -- major things are going on with her mom right now and her mom was checked in to the hospital yesterday afternoon to deal with them... i don't know how much i'm at liberty to say, but i'm really feeling for her mom and for roommate since i'm talking to her at least daily about how things are going there...  *health issues with my grandma -- when i visited her last saturday it took her 10 minutes to realize i was here and stop talking to the wall instead... this is new... i feel guilty because after how this visit last week went, i don't know if i ever want to visit her again all by myself... every time i've seen her in the past year she's been markedly worse and that scares me... as opposed to the previous three years where she'd have bad days and good days, despite the strokes, and you'd find her on an occasional good day that it was encouraging to come back again.  *quals -- i am so not prepared yet and so frustrated with how much i have yet to do.  *moving -- it took 4 days to get all my stuff moved across town, with eric helping every day, and various other people helping intermitently besides... i'm tired, sore, and not ready to organize my life in the new house yet  *other responsibilities -- it struck me this morning that i'm in charge of pizza seminar this year and i've done nothing yet... i have to start harrassing people to find speakers in the next couple weeks  *money troubles -- enough said... too much to pay and i don't get paid til september... it's going to be a long and stressful month  there are some positives though  *i'm now moved into a new house with colleen, and leigh comes back tomorrow -- i have roommates who will read kids books with me (were instituting nightly bedtime story time... _fox in socks_ was our first pick and _go dog go_ will be tonight) and who i can actually talk to when i'm stressed... the living situation will improve once (a) my room gets painted and i can really move into it, and (b) we all get our stuff settled... we'll have cable and internet there starting tuesday  *i have good friends... even after 15 days trapped in a car with me, eric's spent 4 days helping pack and is helping me deal with even more stuff later today... scott, colleen, and others have been particularly helpful lately too.  *i am finally moved except for my laptop, a chair, and a fan -- that's good, right? :-P  so yeah, that's the scoop lately... if you don't hear from me, it's because i'm doing a lot of hiding out and dealing with only 1 person or 2 at a time to stay calm... it's ok -- just check back in a month.

      it's going... far from done, but i'm making progress  conundrum #1: how do you move a full size bed 6 miles down the road from one second story apartment to another?  solution: take apart the bed yourself, then buy 100 feet of rope and make eric and scott do the rest for you...  they did it last night by tying one mattress at a time on the roof of eric's new car and driving slowly across town... my bed is now safely assembled at my new place  conundrum #2: how do you get hot water set up at the new house?  solution: figure out how to turn on the gas-powered boiler in the basement -- pretty sure we haven't figured that part out yet... yay cold showers? :-(  conundrum #3: how do i get the rest of the stuff to my new place when i'm tired and sore?  solution: very slowly, and hopefully before i'm supposed to be out of here (my old place)... and solicit for volunteers! -- any of you close to jersey who want free meals courtesy of me and my credit card, let me know and i'll put you to work :-P  and that's a wrap... carli rossow should be here any time now to have some fun for the day -- this will be good :-)  later dudes.

      what a day...  went to sleep at 4:30am, woke up (on my own, not with a clock) at 9:30, and started packing immediately... my clothes are at the new house and my closets are now 80% empty... all my books and board games (seriously over 2 bookcases full of books) are all gone now too... my room is still a mess, and basically a mountain of stuff... i worked straight until 4:30pm before giving up for the night... so now, pretty sure i'm absolutely exhausted.  i am NOT looking forward to the repeat performance tomorrow.  moving in is a little off too b/c the landlord needs to repaint my room from the previous tenant so i can't put anything on the walls or against them until he has time for that this weekend.... this is not a fun game.  on the other hand, eric has earned the title of hero of the month i think.  he survived 3960 miles in the car with me, and being around me just about 24/7 for 2 weeks without getting more than occasionally minorly annoyed... now here, the first day we're back and he could get a break from lara, he showed up on my doorstep just before noon and with a smile cheered me up a bit and packed his car full of my stuff... he intends to do the same tomorrow -- 3 mighty cheers for eric.  gone to pick up the final two rools of film from my roadtrip... later dudes :-P

      i wrote the most brilliant blog entry ever when i was in detroit friday night... full of all kinds of chipper details of the rest of the trip; unfortunately, eric's g-ma's webTV didn't like the "publish" button to submit that entry, so it's lost... never fear though, i'm working on a wesite to take care of the trip details, so i'll be brief... top 3 ironies/humorous events:  (1) apparently i hum in my sleep and never knew until i hummed loud enough to wake up eric the first two nights on the road... i called roommate and she told me i've been doing that sporadically for years and she never thought it important enough to tell me... dude, i hum songs in my sleep -- how weird is that :-P  (2) apparently eric's great-great-great grandfather built the farm house next door to the house i grew up in (i.e. i grew up playing hide and go seek in an old house his faily's had pictures of for years and wondered how to find for geneology/family history research)... this fact, and the process of discovering this fact led to quite the entertaining evening knocking on random farm house doors in small town illinois this past wednesday night  (3) absolute best highlight of the trip?  eric and me miss a turn leaving yellowstone national park and as a result don't get out of the park going the proper direction until 11:30pm... this means there's nowhere to stop that late until cody, WY, a good 2 hours away.... eric hands me the keys figuring i'm better at being giddy and staying awake than he is... the only road from yellowstone to cody is a "scenic highway" that i'm sure is super nice in the day... however, when it's the worst mountain driving of your 2 week journey and it's after midnight so the only thing you can see are the reflectors popping up 20 feet in front of you and signs that say 20mph with the weirdest curves you've ever seen on them, it's not so much scenic as stupidly dangerous -- but whatever, we were determined to get to cody and sleep in real beds, so i pretended it was a race car game to stay in the middle of the road around the curves (good thing there were NO other cars around for hours and hours!) and eric egged me on.... we stopped a few times to be amazed at how many countless millions more stars you can see in total blackness... then after the moon set and we were debating if montana glows in the dark, i told eric whatever the glow was, it was waving at me... he laughed and told me i was too tired to be driving anymore, and i should stop the car a minute and run around to wake up.... however, i stopped the car to prove him i was right :-P... sure enough, there were are, loud techno (i.e. please keep us awake music) blaring out of the car behind us, standing smack in the middle of wyoming state highway 296, jaws to the ground, staring at aurora borealis for the first time -- i.e. the northern lights!  we totally had a cow, and did a 1:30am happy dance in the middle of the street, clapped, cheered, and had another cow while admiring the lights before getting back in the car... talk about a story to remember... where were you when... you first saw the northern lights?  *i* was doing a happy dance in the middle of a state highway in the wyoming mountains... beat that! :-P  ok, so rest of trip news will come from the website i'm working on.... link here when it's done... in the meantime...  here it is 4am,... tomorrow amanda comes home and i need to move most of my stuff before then (it's currently strewn all over the house and on top of the stuff the girl who's moving into my room, who apparently moved her large furniture all into my living room 2 weeks early... whatever).... i'm not ready for packing... i'm going to wake up and serious just start throwing stacks of books in my back seat and reverse the process to unload... eric said he'd help, but i have to actually use boxes to get him to move stuff... this could pose a problem...  however, eric also said, he doesn't help if i pull an alnighter, so this is me, at 4:15am, signing off and pretending to sleep... wish me luck that i don't spontaneously explode in the next month what with quals and moving.... seriously, why can't i be employed as a professional road trip taker?  i'd love that dude.  night y'all.
