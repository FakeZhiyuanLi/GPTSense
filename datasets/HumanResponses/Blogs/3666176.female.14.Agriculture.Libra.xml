      hey   i know you are probably getting real sick of hearing about my self pitty stories and my boyfriend, but i am SURE that you will get over it eventually.     So you already know that my parents are divorced and well b/c of that and my friend alison i have some real trust issues...   when my parents got a divorce my mom promised me that no matter who she met it would always be a package deal if me and my brother didnt like the guy then she wouldnt either... well that was a lie, i really dont like the guy she is going out with and now the whole world revolves around him...   and in 3-5 grades i had a best friend alison. she moved just b4 6th grade which was devastating (she moved to texas) but soon after i moved to oklahoma, due to the divorce, with my mom. and i went to visit alison, and she had completely changed and could not stand me...  both of these issues kinda created some trust problams with me...  now all of you know my boyfriend, well after a year and a half of nothing but pure love from him you would think that i would learn to trust him with everything... but i couldnt, i was soo scared of gettig my heart broken, scared that the second he got all of my trust he would take it and run...  and worst of all... he trusted me with everything in him (not a bad thing right???) well it was with me. i seemed to think that it was all just a put on that he really didnt care if i cheated on him because he was doing it to me... i mean really, how many guys actually trust a girl with all of their heart with no strings attached??? i just couldnt believe it.   but travis is one of them i guess and no matter how scared but determined i was to keep some of my trust locked in so he couldnt have it all, he stood by me and told me it was alright and never lost his temper. and that right there showed me that he was really true and honest and TRUSTworthy so all in all i gave him my crystal ball of trust for i believe that he could take very good care of it...

      hi, well my boyfriend travis and i have been going out for a little over a year and a 1/2, and yesterday i asked what kind of changes have i made in your life? well i got an answer but it wasnt the one i was looking for ( course not i am a girl - what do you expect huh lol) any how, what i came to realize was that the only way i had changed him was that i got him to not let so many people walk all over him... and when he asked me the same thing i started blurting out all these ways that he had changed me... he has made me appreciate the small things in life, made me more patient, less quick to jump to conclusions and less, almost, self concious, i guess... in other words he has deffinately made me a better person. and i have always thought that was what love was all about... so i guess he is holding up his side real well but what about me, does this mean that i am a bad girlfriend...???  ~laura~

      hi    well last night i went over to my friend ammies house and we spent the night at her sister nikkis house... well nikkis husband mike went out and bought ammie and our friend tiffany sky blue ( an alchoholic beverage) and they repeatedly asked me to have one and i repeatedly told them no. and the only reason i told them no was because of a promise i made my boyfriend travis just after we started going out: i will never drink nor smoke nor do drugs. i made this promise with the consiquence that he would break up with me and in turn i made him promise the same thing. and for all of you out there if i ever lost travis my world would turn upside down... so needless to say i made my first big peer pressure accomplishment last night and am very proud of it and i hope travis is to... :)  talk later ~Laura~

      Well... Um I am a 14 year old female with many delays, hurdles, jams and worries. i curently live in oklahoma, but my parents divorced when i was 10, so i spend all of my summer vacation in corinth, mississippi- and for all of you who have never been to corinth or even mississippi for that matter have no idea how boring it really is here... unless you have a mob of friends you like to be around all the time or you have a car... neither of which i have here in mississippi. Anyhow my father is currently in the military the army to be exact and his current time as a recruiter is almost expired so there is a huge possibility that he will be leaving for iraq for the remainder of his time in the army which is 2 years... i have a baby-half-brother eathan who is driving me CRAZY a stepsister courtney who has got to be the biggest whine bag in the world and a step mom who is pretty cool until she gets mad... my real brother is a complete ediot and a complete step family who will NOT for the life of thenm stay out of each others business. i do however have two rays of light in my life... my boyfriend travis. he has got to be the most excellent person on the face of this earth he never complains about the attitude that i know i have or the eternal ?s of trust that i pelt at him daily, instead he stays calm and loving throughout everything and is always there when i need a shoulder to cry on (which is most often then not);P and to top it all off he has a family of angels who have got to be the best people in the world. They would do anything for me with out thinking twice which my own mother wouldnt do for me at times.  and my second ray of light in the dark is my best friend elizabeth. she is always there for me and can always put a smile on my face and we are each others rock foundation i have had to be there for her and her me. we hae been friends for almost four years. her family also would do anything for me i even call her grandma,grandma for goodness sakes...    well that is my life as i know it to be right now i hope youre not too bored. talk later, ~laura~

      im in a pretty good mood today iguess for the most part nothing bad has happened yet this morning.  i just got finished watching the matrix reloaded and so i figure i will inform you on what i thought about it: it was overall a pretty good movie although ifound it quite tough to keep up with umm i guess that has to do with the fact that i havent seen the first one in about 1 year and a half but i do think the graphics and special effects were overall good for the amount of them they had to use ( not to corny in other words) and the sound effects were amazing. umm i think that is all i have to say about it. the first one was more understandable but the secound one was way cooler... i still have matrix revolution still to watch though i hope that one is easier to understand...8o)

      well everyone has there little pet peeves right well one of mine is going to see a movie with a person that has already seen it. i know it sounds really stupid, but i see it as pointless. i dont want to be sitting in the theater with someone who has seen the movie we are watching before. it makes me feel stupid when i am laughing my head off and they are sitting their with a "it was funnier when i first saw it" smirk on their face.   all of this puts me in a delima because my friend and i promised we would see a couple of movies together when i got back from mississippi, but one of the movies they have already seen. they say they still want to see it with me but i dont see the point in dragging them to a movie that they have already seen when they could go see  another one, with that same money, that they havent seen. (altho part of me really wants to go with them i cant bring myself to want to see a movie with someone who has already seen it.)  so help me out should i still go see it with them, should we go to another movie neither of us has seen, or should we just not go at all? talk later laura

      well as all that have read my blog from the beginning know i have lots of problems in life and i always seem to have roads to choose from but dont always know which ones to choose, good or bad.  well i said in the previous post that i dont how id be without my boyfriend travis...well i know now i would probably be a drunk, drug addicted, highschool-dropout, runaway. yesterday i was watching a show and this girl had her nose and her tongue peirced and i thought to myself how awesome it would be to have my nose and tongue peirced and then i thought thats not who i am, but then if thats not who i am then why do i think it is soo cool??? recently i started listening to rap music as in Get Low, Shake Your Tail Feather, Salt Shaker. And in my heart i knew it would be something that wouldnt go over well with travis and that bugged me because music is my life it is how i communicate i listen to differant styles of music when i am in differant moods. So when i let travis listen to one of the songs it put me in a bad mood to learn that he didnt like that kind of music, even though i had contemplated that already. i like that kind of music but i dont like it as much if i know that my other half doesnt... you see me and travis are like the little people on your shoulders i am the one telling you to go do what you want that you shouldnt care anymore of you gt in trouble but then travis is telling that, that is wrong and he helps you to make the right decision.  (i have no idea if this post is ever going to have a point i think i am just typing out my feelings...so sit back and enjoy lol)  No matter what every one subconciously knows the differance between right and wrong and i cant go against the right ive never been able to. And there is the reason i get mad when travis states his opinion or a fact because i know he has the right outlook on everything...and he doesnt want me to do wrong although i have a major  nagging to just break the rules and do something im really not supposed to for once.  my parents are major pains in the butts i cant go and do any thing with out having to do somthing for someone and when i get what i have to do done i end up have to tag along with someone, (parental supervision) i have never been able to go to the movies with any guy friends alone, yes no girlfriends either. i cant even go shopping at the mall by myself. and when i go over to someones house my mom has to talk to the parents and make sure i have not left out the smallest of details... and its things like these that have made me want to constantly break the rules.  i will go now let you soak up this information and i will post again later... thanks for listening laura

      well lately i just dont know how i feel about my life or the people in it. i dont know whether my boyfriend travis really loves me or not anymore, he doesnt act like it...  i dont know if the bond i had with my father is fading right before my eyes. i dont know if i even want to keep living anymore.   i think i want to but then i think about what all has happened in my life lately and try to decide if it is ever going to get any better... i just dont know anymore...  have you ever just felt like you were on a marry-go-round and just wont stop no matter how loud or long you scream? my whole life feels like that right now i keep going around in circles with my feelings wishing it would all end but then i think about the one thing i have to live for and i dont know if that one thing is even there anymore. which then catapults me into an ever faster rotation. i keep wishing it would go away, all of it. my whole life,keep wishing it would all just dissapear. then i wonder where i would be without everyone?   would i die or would i be able to live and breathe better without them?   at points i think life would end without my boyfriend travis, but then i think about what i would do if i lost him and i dont know if i would be miserable or ok...   and it is thoughts like these that fuel the merry-go-round i call a life. so i am going to go now and give the operator guy another quarter because i have a feeling that i am going to be on this ride for a really long time...
