      So, things have been crazy this week.  I went to see the Merchant of Venice last night, and didn't go to bed until 12:30. I woke up at 5:30, so yeah...  There's so much crap that needs to be done....  My mom picked up my dress for me today. It doesn't fucking fit. This pisses me off because it is the exact same style and size of the dress that did fit me. Now, I'll probably end up with a dress I really don't want. Superb!  Ryan is so much work. Really. I realize now, that although I really do like him, I could've worked this out better by thinking things through a little more...I swear, we haven't even established a "Hello, how are you?" constant yet. I'm thinking I made a mistake. I also don't think I should've told him I have a crush on him. He can hardly make eye contact with me anymore. I was thinking of asking if he wanted to do something this weekend, but I dunno. We'll see... He's just so damn difficult, if I applied this much effort to school, I'd be in better shape.  I think I need to go on a serious diet...Serious!

      I have this overwhelming feeling of disappointment and anger at the moment. I have some idea as to why. I've become suddenly very disappointed in the people with whom I surround myself. My own friends make me so angry sometimes. They make idiotic choices and continue and continue making them once you'd have thought they'd learned. I've come to loathe IB kids and all they stand for. Hell, Megan and Kristen aren't even in IB and they drive me up the goddamn wall. All of these people do things they don't even enjoy just because they think they'll impress someone on a transcript. Maybe my problem with this has just now become an issue. I realized about a month ago that I dislike most of what I do. I know for a fact that the majority of IB kids (and those two) only do their good samaritan deeds and attend leadership conferences and numerous volunteer activities for their transcripts. A lot of the things I currently do I have no way out of... Take Kristen for example. She volunteers at a hospital. Doesn't want to be a doctor. Goes to leadership conference after leadership conference. Is one of the most socially awkward people you will ever want to meet in your life, doesn't stand out as a leader. Soccer. Tennis. Basketball. Student government during freshman year. See above social problems. Youth Commission. My baby, but to her, it's something else to add to the transcript. Maybe I'm bitter because it was something that I could do, thinking she wouldn't try to grab hold of it. But no, she took that too. Megan's almost the same way. But if I call either of them, they're both bitching about how horrible school is. Maybe they should lighten their loads a little. Ya think?   I'm sickened that they honestly don't like this stuff but continue to add more items to the list. I dunno... maybe it would make more sense to be really passionate about a couple of things rather than apathetic about all of them...   I'm also disappointed in myself. I know I've wasted away a lot of the talent I did have. I hardly feel adequate anymore. For God's sake, I can't even spell anymore. I hate how apathetic I've become when it comes to academics. My GPA is still fine, I suppose, but I could kick myself for the way I've let myself slip. And the thing is - even though I'm aware of how dumb I'm letting myself get, I don't do anything to change it.   My relationships with people are strange right now, too. I feel like I don't put in as much effort as I should. I don't know why I do that, though. It's odd. The funny thing about the Ryan situation is that he reminds me so much of myself. I'm not exactly the most open, outgoing person and I have now come to realize how much work I allow other people to put into me. With Ryan, I'm going to have to be the one to make the most effort - hopefully, just at first. I also realize that I haven't been exactly the easiest person for past boyfriends to deal with. I kind of feel like I'm looking into a mirror. I suppose I've met my match...(That was supposed to sound as though I'm some type of villain, or something, but really, it just came off as me sounding completely obsessed and as though I'm looking to marry him)  I feel like I'm free-falling a lot of the time, as if I have no control over anything these days. I hate this feeling

      Eh, another day...  Saturdays are my lesson days. Today's was an hour longer because of quartet practice, which does suck, but I miss playing with a group.    I went out with Kat last night. We were supposed to go see Eternal Sunshine, but we had forgotten it was rated R and she couldn't get in. She made me take her to the Mills instead, which was pretty horrible. It was just so goddamn boring. Of course, Kat "needs" everything she sees, so that made for a lovely walk around that horrible place which is in fact shaped like an extremely large track.   She's just so irritating. I knew Adrienne had plans last night and I didn't feel like calling anyone else, so I asked her if she wanted to go out because I didn't want to be home all evening. Of course, Kat found out Adrienne was going to be getting drunk with that girl who was staying over at her place, so Kat made me drop her off there. She kept checking her phone the whole goddamn time, too, to make sure she hadn't missed any calls from her other friends. Fanfuckingtastic.   Ooh, I also hit some weird reflector thing while going in reverse. Then, when I was driving Kat to Adrienne's, there was a median. On one side of the median was a Do Not Enter sign. That was the side I needed to be on, so I was slightly confused, but went onto the other side. Apparently, that was a bad decision, since there was a car heading straight towards me...Did I mention my headlights suck?

      Well, I had to tell Steven about Ryan. At first, he sounded happy for me, but then he said the most dramatic thing I've ever heard. "Hope has hit me in the face yet again." Apparently it had a double meaning, as Ryan's last name has "Hope" in it and Ryan has literally hit him in the face with paintballs, which I find almost funny. The other "hope" is of course metaphorical, meaning this has dashed his hope of going with me...And then he says, "I hope you two have fun together."  Then he got somewhat angry at me for apologizing to him. "You're either torn between the two of us now, you're pitying me, or it's something else." Then later, "Don't feel sorry. I asked you knowing how much you like Ryan, and I asked you a yes or no question knowing the answer could be either." Then, he signed off saying, "I wish you the best..."   Like I said, drama...

      I called Ryan and asked him. I swear to God, that was the most awkward conversation I've had in my entire life. I TOLD him I have a crush on him...I TOLD him. More awkward than that, though, was the fact that he said, "Okay." Just okay. He didn't hesitate or anything, so I don't really think much of it, like I highly doubt he felt obligated or a sense of pity, or he would have hesitated a bit.   I got what I wanted, though.   I don't know how I'm going to tell Steven. I feel horrible...  I feel very, very ill at the moment. I don't think my nervousness has subsided yet.

      Haha...oh boy oh boy. The shit sure did hit the fan today. What a horrible expression. I regret using it.   Well, do you remember that odd conversation I had with Steven the other night? I now fully understand his intentions. He asked me to prom today. I think I was really rude today, and I am truly sorry for that. I hesitated for a very long time and told him possibly and that I'd have to think it over. I think I actually said, "This is awkward," out loud. The worst part about all of this, though, is that he knows how much I like Ryan. Adrienne's convinced that he did it only to ward off impending threat because I'm pretty sure he knew I was going to ask Ryan out. This puts me in a completely awkward position. I still had hopes of asking Ryan out some time and now that he's in the picture, everything's kind of messed up. He knows I I don't feel this way about him because I've told him my "list", and well frankly, he isn't on it. I know I'm not his first choice either, so I feel like I've been pulled out of the reject bin because he knows he's already out of the picture for those other (three, I think) girls. So, I think I'm currently in fourth place. Yes!   To make matters worse, although, I don't give a rat's ass (this just really speeds up the whole process) Dan tells me today that Kate hates me, and I do literally mean hates me, because I like Ryan. Honestly...I'm glad she's so infantile. They went on ONE date during the summer, and apparently she calls him her "project" which is just the perfect name for another human being. For Christ's sake, who the hell does she think she is? Goddamned queen of the universe...He also informed me that she's planning on asking him out to spite me. Let me make sure you read that correctly: TO SPITE ME. I then told Daniel that I was going to walk up to Ryan and ask him to lift his shirt so I could see if he had any "Property of Kate Melvin" tattoos. He said, "No, not now. Wait until Kate's around." Mind you, we were on speaking terms until she found this out. Now she hates me. I don't even know how she found out about this, but I think I have a pretty good idea. I know whom I can't confide in anymore. Up until now, I've prided myself on the fact that I have no (known) enemies. So, now Adrienne's forcing me to ask Ryan to prom tomorrow evening. She actually tried to get me to do it at about 5 o'clock today. I told her I needed to prepare myself.   Dan also told me this story about some guy who used to live near Kate. She liked him and apparently all of the other neighborhood girls did as well. One day, Kate went completely stark-raving mad and wigged out on these girls for talking to him. Now they dislike her. Buahahaa...You'd think she'd get the fucking picture.    (Adrienne also admitted to liking him (Ryan), but she told me she couldn't pursue anything out of respect for me. I knew she did. I love how everything has turned into a great big circle of CRAP)   Jesus Christ, I hate high school. All of this drama is fucking ridiculous. It's so stereotypical, I can't stand it.

      I still have an SNES and a Lion King video game. When you put in the game, Rafiki says, "It starts."  Anyway, school started again today. Boy, I must say that I'm glad I'm back. I'd forgotten how much I hate people. It wouldn't have been so bad if the bullshit hadn't begun before I even fucking walked in the building. And then, when I got to my locker, these idiot guys were standing there. One of them said, "How do you like this word - 'white power'?" I murmured, "You idiot, that's two words." Before he could hear me, another one of the idiots says, "How do you like this word - 'Power to the people'?" I can't even comment.  And then, sitting in biology, I had this overwhelming feeling of stress. I had been back in school five minutes and she throws this huge research project on us. I'm going to be researching gel electrophoresis and restricted fragment length phorisms...or something like that. I don't even know what the hell that is. I had just gotten rid of all of this stress I was feeling, and it all came back being in that place for 5 minutes...What the hell?   Last night, I had this interesting conversation with Steven. He asked me how things were going with Ryan, and I told him that they kind of weren't. He told me that maybe it was for the best. After telling him I was slightly offended yet intrigued, I told him he'd have to explain what he meant by that. Protesting, he told me to give him a day or two and he'd explain completely. Then he said he was on his hands and knees begging me to not force it out of him at that current point in time. I let it go, but I told him I wouldn't let it rest. Eventually, he was going to tell me. He said that actually, he hoped to bring it up first. I'm slightly confused and don't really know if this has to do with Steven or Ryan. I really hope that he doesn't give me some information about Ryan that I just don't want to hear. But even more than that, I'm really hoping he doesn't admit that he likes me or something along those lines.   I like how I assume things...

      I went shopping again today. I bought two shirts and the sweetest sunglasses. They're cat-eyed with rhinestones on the sides. They make me feel so emo. The lenses are clear, though, so I can just wear them and look rad without actually being outside.        When I reread this journal (or blog, whatever you want to call it) I realized that I don't really talk about things. I mean, I talk about superficial crap like, "This is what I did today..."   I guess lately I haven't really felt like writing about anything, you know, deep. As deep as a 17-year-old can get, rather. I just feel kind of numb lately, as if I had no emotions.  Looking back at the past couple of months in my old Bolt journal, I realized I've been acting this way for a while. Heh, maybe I  am   heartless!   I guess me being numb isn't the best explanation, nor is it very likely. As much trouble as guys are, I really do think I miss having one in my life. I know I'm not one of those girls who needs to have a boyfriend around to make her more sure of herself or whatever. I know that I am relatively strong and confident in myself as a female, so it isn't that. I just miss having that type of relationship. I've been very dependent upon my friends as of late. I need them to talk to and to just be there for me.  The thing is, though, that emotionally there are just some things they can't do. The other night, one of my friends gave me a hug, and the fact that it was so completely platonic made me miss having a boyfriend. I really want to be held and to have someone's arms wrapped around me, getting that incredible feeling of being so safe and comfortable with that person. I also miss being kissed, although not as much as being held.  I don't even mean full-frontal snogging. Little pecks on the cheek, lips, or even the tip of my nose would satisfy that feeling.   If I combine these things, maybe what I miss the most is being important, if not special, to someone in that way. I miss caring about someone like that, too...   The weird thing about this is that I'm not really in a hurry. And honestly, I have no reason to be in a hurry. I don't feel like trying to create something from nothing.  This is one of those things I just want to happen as if it were magic. That's cheesy, but I think it's true.  I think that I want to be in love with someone more than I just want to have someone around...

      Christ, I'm so bored...  There's no one online to talk to... Toni and Matt are my only online buds who even bother to talk to me anymore, anyway. And they're not on at the moment, at least I don't think they are. I always feel like I'm bothering everyone else. They make it so god damned awkward to talk to them (with the exception of Toni and Matt, of course). Hell, I figure that if any of them actually WANTED to talk to me, they would on their own doing.  So, from now on, they can seek me out. I don't need to feel out of place for talking to friends. I could make them feel just as awkward, I guess, but I'm not that spiteful.    In other news, I have this amazing scratch on my wrist. It looks like I took a razor blade to it. It's all scabbed over and shit. I'm impressed.   I also feel incredibly ugly and fat today. I need to go to the gym tomorrow. I have to squeeze my ass into a size small dress in like a month. Haha, that won't fix my ugly problem, though, eh?

      Tonight, I went to Adrienne's for her birthday. We just hung out and watched some movies and ate pizza. We took a short side trip to Mills, though. Kat and I pretended nothing happened, and besides, I wouldn't have argued with her on Adrienne's birthday anyway.   Adrienne has a rather extensive collection of sunglasses so we put those on and posed like idiots around her room so I could finish up my disposable camera from September (homecoming pics).   It's fun acting like a little kid again.        I have to get like, all 5 of my cameras developed.

      Okay, so I didn't get the red dress. This can be easily explained, I suppose. I tried on this white dress my mom liked just to appease her. Turns out, I actually liked that dress, except not in white. I was forced to squeeze into a small since the medium was too big (on my boobs, of course). I refused to get white, however. It seemed too weddingy. So, we left that store and found another place that just so happened to have the beautiful white dress - in pink. However, the small in that dress (although it was the same size and maker) was too small. We went back to the other store and asked the woman to order the white dress in pink, since it looked so princessy and oh-so pretty. So now, I do get to look like a princess! Yay!  My mom bought me the pink sundress thing I wanted at Forever 21, too. Only $16. It looks hot with the denim jacket and pin I bought to go with it.   Oh how I love pink!

      I think I found a prom dress today. It's red. Solid, bright red. It'll be hot. Long black gloves, red lips, classic hair. It'll be movie star-esque.   Adrienne and I think we can "swing", as we put it, dates by prom. She's like, "It'd be fantastic if you went with Ryan and I went with Evan." It's not much fun when your group consists of two people. Dan claims he's not going and I'm not a fan of Lydia's group, nor were we invited, so I have Adrienne as of now and she has me, which means I will be abandoned that night so she can walk around mingling like a crazy person or dancing with Elise. Super. I need a date to keep me company, in a truly pathetic sense of the word.     I plan to ask Ryan out when school starts again. I guess. Might as well.   Um, that's it...

      Wonderfalls is a brilliant show. The girl reminds me so much of myself.  Little Girl: You're not supposed to be stealing. Jaye: You're not supposed to be talking to strangers! Piss off!!     Jaye's sister, Sharon: I don't like you because your genitals are on the outside!       I called James today to let him know about the uniform, rather the lack thereof. I had just the sash. When I called, however, they were already in the middle of "filming" and had improvised a uniform for Ryan. Maybe it isn't fate, Adrienne.   I went to the gym today. I stayed on that eliptical trainer thing for over a half hour, so I could get to 300 calories burned off. However, as soon as I came back out from the locker room on my way out, a beautiful (and I do mean beautiful) man was there. It was so disappointing. Maybe the fact that all the attractive people come out when I leave is a bad sign.

      In all actuality, I'm not excited in the least about spring break. I might get started on my ToK, extended, and (both)English essays, however. I plan on spending the bulk of my time at the gym, as prom is rapidly approaching. Adrienne and I are going to go dress shopping, I think.  James asked me if I had a Girl Scout uniform that he could borrow for his Spanish video.  Apparently, Ryan (yes,  my   Ryan) needs to wear a Girl Scout uniform in their Spanish movie. I have no idea, however, where my old uniform is. I'll have to ask my mom about that. Dan (we made up) told me that I should go with my original plan and say, "Mom, the guy I really like needs to use my Girl Scout uniform." It sounds like some kind of weird fetish thing. He'll have to settle for my sash if I can't find the rest of the uniform.   Heh, I told Adrienne that story in the parking lot today, and she practically screamed, "It's fate, Nicole!"

      I don't know whether I should say that things have been good or that things have been bad. I don't really know.  I had two tests today. Biology and chemistry. We graded our mock exams today in math. I'll probably just barely pass my IB exam. I only got a 16/20 on the IAs...I'm kind of disappointing myself, but it's not like I haven't been trying.  Hm...Dan. This is a tricky subject. I don't know why he's not speaking to me. He lied to me and told me he wasn't angry at me, that he was angry at the people around that day. Apparently, it was me. I don't know what I did. All I know is that that boy sure can hold a grudge. I don't plan on making up with him. If he's angry with me, he needs to confront me with his feelings. I'm not going to tolerate him not speaking to me just because he's weird like that. Lydia thinks it's because he doesn't like getting close to people. That's illogical though. He's closer to Lydia than to anyone else.  I don't really feel like going to Lydia's birthday brunch on Sunday if Dan has not recovered by then. I'll feel completely out of place and uncomfortable with Lydia's other friends. And besides, if he isn't going to speak to me, I'd rather stay home than attempt to bear the discomfort.  Kat will be there, but when she's around Lydia, she becomes some weird type of lackey-thing.    Steven invited me to go play paintball with him and his friends, telling me that that would be an excellent "bonding" experience for Ryan and I, as I'm sure I've already mentioned.  Adrienne was going to go with me so I didn't feel completely weirded out not knowing any of those guys very well. Unfortunately, we found out from Ryan himself while we were taking his psychology experimental exam thing that he's going to be in Florida on that day. Adrienne proceeded to ask him if he was "one of those guys who doesn't like taking off his shirt?"(He would most likely return from FL with a tan, right?) He got this weird, half-smile on his face and said he wasn't. Then, to top that off, she asked him if he was "one of those guys who doesn't like touchy-feely stuff?" Again, he smiled oddly, and said no.  I'm such a genius, though. It was my turn to take the psych test and he never said start or anything, so I started, stopped, and asked him if he was ready. Then, I started again and he was still setting his watch. Haha, Adrienne said it was cute. I think I looked like a moron. THe point of that, however, is that I will not be playing paintball!! Hoo-rah  Then, this morning, Adrienne and I were sitting in the hall upstairs, he walks upstairs and looked like he was looking for someone. She started talking to him and told him he could "sit down and talk to us while you wait for her, or you can leave. But you COULD sit with us." Because she had made the situation so awkward, he got this strange look on his face and sat down immediately. We all talked for a couple minutes and then he left. It's really cute, though, because he tries to keep his stoic composure and can't help it. He ends up smiling anyway, and MY GOD it's a wonderful smile. He's so much nicer than he appears. He'll probably end up thinking Adrienne has a thing for him, though. But, as she says, this at least has opened up a corridor of conversation. I'm considering asking him if he'd like to go out with me some time. I don't know. I'll have to see how things go.  Why does it seem as though I am getting attention from a variety of males at the very moment I am interested in one? It's like some kind of great big conspiracy designed to confuse me. While I really like Ryan's personality, looks, and brain (possibly in that order. *gasp* how shallow!), I've been beginning to talk to Evan quite frequently and I rather like him. He's quite interesting to talk to and he's really rather nice to me. I don't know...I think I create situations in my mind that are more complicated than in actuality.

      Is that wrong to say that about yourself?   I went to see Hello, Dolly! last night. It was super.   It's weird when people you know, and have no intention of sleeping with, make sexual jokes in regards to sleeping with you all because your away message says "If you were my homework, I'd be doing you all wrong on my desk right now." His response was "I'm a lot harder than homework, but it'd be more fun!" But I'll let it pass because he suggested methods of me making "my move" on Rrrryan...Apparently, I'll be going paintballing (blech...) with a group of guys on the 22nd...super. I'm thrilled...whoo...He said it could be a "bonding experience" for Rrrrryan and I.

      Silly me, I forgot. I got the adviser I wanted for my Extended Essay. My topic is history. I'm thinking about something along the lines of the health of nations as a function of their leaders' health, mental or physical. Of course, I'll have to narrow that down.

      New seats in chemistry...oh they're soooo wonderful. I sit directly in front of my "all dark and shit" dude. I'm thrilled, hear you me! THRILLED! It was meant to be, I swear.  On a similar note, prom invitations came out today. Who knew it was that time already?   Wonderful news on the subject of my IB exam. You get a packet of like, 10 pages of formulas you can use on the math portion of the exam. It's a beautiful thing.  I'm slightly less scared now.    I had my interview for the volunteer program at the hospital. I'm going to be working at the breast cancer center, most likely. I basically hold patients' hands and comfort them so they have someone to talk to or be with so they don't have to go through the process (some truly heinous tests) all alone.   *Nic

      I've given up on my Bolt journal. Bolt doesn't work half of the time I attempt to use it. Besides, the only reason I go to Bolt anymore is to use the journal and to talk to a few people. Thos people are perfectly capable of contacting me when I'm not on Bolt, and I can use this site, so bye bye Bolt.   Aaaaanyway.... School and people at school are weird. I seem to be getting along better with males lately than I do with females. It's odd. I just enjoy talking to them moreso than girls.   To completely contradict my last statements, Lyd was making up a guest list for her birthday dinner party. I think she's going to invite Ryan just because she knows I like him. Or...she could be attempting to provoke a fight between myself and Kate over him, but I doubt that. Who wants a fight on their birthday? If she does end up inviting him (I saw that she had writting Ryan _______ with a question mark), that's very wonderful of her.   Academically, school is sucking beyond all belief. We were assigned extended essays today. I think I have a topic in mind though. I'd like to write something on the health of states as a function of the physical/mental health of their leaders.    Speaking of essays, I have one that I should be writing at the moment.     *Nic

      Another day, eh?  Ryan and I took a rain-check on tonight. The weather's kind of icky...  I took my pictures in to school today to show my friends. Kat took two of them and ripped them into tiny little pieces. I'm so pissed off at her for that. After she realized how angry I was, she apologized and offered to replace them. She seems to be missing the point. You don't just destroy someone else's belongings.   Today, other than that, was really easy. No bio work, math was simple...didn't have to go to chem. Marcus is such a flirtatious little dude. He was playing footsie with me during math and rubbed my shoulders like three times. People don't understand the concept of the personal space bubble. Haha, Steven had regionals for swimming today and was telling me last night about shaving his legs. I made him show me today, and he made me feel them, lol...That Evan kid is weird, too. When did he get hot? Really! Haha, interesting story. He admitted to me about being a big wuss, and told me he had a nightmare about The Sixth Sense, waking up from which caused him to rip a large hole in his pants with his pen during ToK. He had to staple the crotch and wear them like that for an entire day. Honestly, I really like him, but I don't know what's going on with that. We talk a lot. It's cool being friends, I suppose.   That was weird. Where did that come from?

      I'm so glad that prom happened. Well, I'd prefer to stay in that moment for a longer period of time, but it's all working out so well. Ryan and I are on very good terms and are going out this weekend. He came over to talk to me before history started today and then I asked him to sit with my friends and I during lunch.  He told me he had been reluctant to return his tux, and I asked him why. He answered, "Because I really liked it!" Haha, it was the best thing ever.  Steven told me that I looked "stunning" the other night. My mom's so cute. I told her about all of the comments and she was like, "So you were the talk of prom, eh?" and then she started asking about Ryan and I. I think she likes him and she wants it to continue. (I told her how polite he was) Then she had to ruin it all by making a joke. "Were you the only girl at prom?" Ouch man, ouch.  In other news, I am now the Chief Executive High Commander General OF Hate of the Duchy of Sept aka Princess from Heaven. It's a really long story but it's amusing. Evan and I are at war.  Hey, he declared war on me first. We told him that we're going to take his beautiful eyes once we decapitate him.  Anxiety attack: ToK essays are due on Thursday!!! I have less than one sentence written!

      Hahaha, oh my god. I had so much fun.   I ran around all morning trying to find jewelry and then went to get my hair done.   Ryan was kind of late picking me up, but it was all good. He got lost on the way, so I forgave him. And well, he just looked really good. How could I stay mad? Okay, I was never actually mad.   He opened doors for me, offered to carry my stuff, pulled out and pushed in my chair for me...so on and so forth. My goodness, he is so polite. At one point, my throat had started to hurt, and i went back to our table to get a drink, but someone had drunk all of my water and there was none left in the pitcher at the table, so he went to get me some...He offered me his arm when we were coming and going...Gave me his jacket when we were leaving.  Slow dances made me so happy. I think it took him a while to get really comfortable with being that close to me, but after we were, he held me really close and kind of rested his head against mine...so I just *gave in* and rested my head on his shoulder. Haha, he smelled really good. It was really gooooood. Adrienne had originally planned on leaving after "I Believe in a Thing Called Love" by The Darkness ended, but "Here's to the Night" came on, and she looked over at us and kind of mouthed "Let's stay" at me.   It also just feels good to get compliments from people...I don't think Ryan exactly knew how so he just started telling me that my dress turned out great (he knew about the issues I was having earlier). Ryan excused himself to go to the restroom, and then apparently, he had found a friend of his and talked to him for a minute. In the meantime, however, this senior guy, Dan (not my Dan) came over to me and talked to me for a minute. Then he asked me if I wanted to dance and told me that I looked beautiful. He was really touchy (moreso than my date) and strange, but it was a good dance. He's a funny guy, so he like, spun me around and stuff to Queen's "Bohemian Raphsody". Ryan didn't mind.   Haha, Lars told me that she thought I looked like a "princess from heaven". LMAO... Then Cassiope was like "Nicole, you look like a ballerina."   When we were leaving, it was raining and Ryan gave me his jacket then helped me into the car...We got to Adrienne's about 20 minutes before she did, so we sat in his car and talked for a long time. He's so great...When she finally did get there, he carried my bag inside for me, and made sure I didn't fall up the steps. He left his tennis shoes in his car while he changed and wore his dress shoes with his jeans and shirt until we got to After Prom. Hehe, they were so shiny...  After Prom was alright. A lot of work went into that, you could tell. Haha...Ryan gambled the whole time. Rollie and Adrienne were "hypnotized". Eh, I don't really have that many details.  He took me home and helped me out of the car, even though by that time I was dressed in normal clothes. He offered to carry my stuff for me and he walked me to my door. I was contemplating giving him a kiss on the cheek, but we just hugged and agreed to do something this coming weekend.

      Prom is tomorrow, yo.  There's so much work to be done. My dress is a bit wrinkled. I have to go pick up the boutonniere I ordered for Ryan. My hair needs did. I have to go buy a camera and pantyhose. Oh, yes...and make-up and nail polish.  Ryan called me last night to find out what kind of flower I wanted for my corsage. It was cute. He also asked me if I wanted to do something tonight, but you know, it's snowing...My parents freak about that. He said, "Hopefully it doesn't snow then."  Agh, he just called. I feel so bad. He's in Lakewood right now (getting his tux, let's all "aww" together) and wanted to go do something.  Except, it's snowing, and well, I wasn't even about to ask if I could go out in the snow. My parents are so weird about that. He then asked if I wanted to do something tomorrow. I told him I was getting my hair done at one and he asked if I wanted to hang out before or after that. That's weird, eh? He's calling me tonight.  Back to my story. He called me again this morning because he had forgotten to ask where I wanted to wear my corsage. It's so cute. I like it.   I'm so excited but so extremely nervous...   I'm sick. My dress is being a pain in my ass. It's snowing.

      I'm back from State. What what... Placed 9th in business math. It's respectable, I suppose. It should be out of 45. There are nine districts and supposedly 5 competitors from each district...  Adrienne didn't get the office she really, honestly and truly, worked exceedingly hard for. She had even helped the girl who did win to cram for the written portion of the test. What a world we live in, eh? You can BS your way through things and succeed when someone who honestly deserves something more than you doesn't get it. Super.  Vail is such a cute little town. Expensive, but cute. I mean, I saw this tank top that cost $96 because it had some tacky little rhinestones on it. We went shopping the first day so Dan could buy a tie, and we came across multiple shirts that cost upwards of $700 each. He then went into a fur store because he saw a stuffed rabbit he wanted. He spent $44 on a tiny little bunny made from animal fur. It was utterly ridiculous.  We met some hot boys on our balcony. They invited us to party with them the other night but Adrienne was upset and fell asleep. I didn't want to go alone. When we went outside the next morning, it was so lovely to see their cigars and used condoms.     Ryan noticed I was gone.

      I took Sam for a walk/run so I could get some exercise and try to clear my head.  I really only succeeded in confusing myself more, but I did come to three conclusions. They are as follows: 1.) I'm fat. 2.) Guys are pigs. 3.) The only logical solution to all of my problems is for me to become a lesbian.  (Note: #'s 2. and 3. are not related.)  1 came about as I was running. I was thinking, "Jeezus Christ, I've gained some weight. This will not suffice. Should my lungs be burning this badly? My God, I'm fat!"  2 was a result of two young high school boys yelling "Hey baby!" at me as I walked by.  They said something else, but I couldn't quite make it out. I was preparing a fem-nazi speech at that point in time, but unfortunately, I wasn't given the opportunity to deliver it.   3 is of course, a result of all of my Ryan issues. He makes me hate myself. I hate those girls who throw themselves at guys, and I feel as though that's exactly what I'm doing. I'm so glad I can have depreciated in self-worth and dignity within the last month or so. This WILL NOT do. Not at all. I can't live with myself if I continue to make so much effort. I am not one of "those" girls, nor will I ever be content to let myself become one.    The point of my walk, however, was to try to make sense of the Ryan issues. I don't know if I am making a mistake or not. I'll just try to put it aside for the rest of this week.

      I don't know what his deal is. I must admit, though, that he's extremely good at giving mixed messages. After Tuesday night, I was feeling really good about the way things were going, and he was doing really well for the rest of the week; he actually sought ME ought to talk to me and he had been making an effort. I asked him if we were still on for this weekend, though, and he's like, "I'm actually really busy." Seriously, what does that mean? Maybe he really is busy, but then again, maybe he's not and that's his way of telling me, "Ugh, get away." On Tuesday, he had me pretty convinced that he liked me.   Goddamnit! Why do I do this? I always tell myself that I'm not going to try so hard when it comes to guys, and I honestly don't want to let them make me feel like crap. Maybe I'm not the strong, independent female I thought I was. I just don't know how to deal with this. Why do I try so hard? Things always go to crap anyway. Technically, things have already gone to crap, and they haven't even begun yet.   I have these weird ups and downs with him. Half the time, I regret asking him because I feel like I'm doing something horrible to him, like I'm forcing him to go with me. Then, other times, he manages to make me feel really good about the way things are going. It's like a great big roller coaster of drama. Okay, it really isn't that dramatic. I definitely think he is more comfortable talking to me now than he was before. We're actually on "Hey, how are you?" terms. I dunno, I guess I do have to give him a few points. He is seemingly rather shy around girls and I imagine this isn't the easiest and/or most comfortable situation for him either. This would be much easier if he were easier to read...   Eh, for some reason, I haven't been able to explain my feelings very well lately. Usually writing works for me. What's the deal?

      So, I called him to ask him what we planned on doing about prom, and he asked me out for this weekend. Isn't that odd? I mean, he didn't speak to me at school, hardly even acknowledged my presence...Well, at least now I don't have to wonder whether or not he likes me. Maybe he's just exceedingly shy...  He bought our prom tickets. I hate when guys do that. It makes me so damn uncomfortable.

      Quote of the Day:  S:"Who are you going to prom with?" N:*points* L:"The broooooding one in the corner."   So anyway, last night was the Something Corporate concert. My God, they make me so happy. I think I fell in love with Andrew MacMahon. We had excellent "seats" for the first third of the show, then after that, the pushing got so severe that Jen began to hyperventilate, so we went outside for a few then ended up getting stuck in the back. But oddly enough, just because my sister shared her water with some chick, the girl offered us the chance to go backstage and meet SoCo because her friend was back there currently and was producing some live footage or something. It would've rocked. She called him a few times to see what he could do, but he said that since the three of us weren't 18, we'd have to go back all together and he wasn't sure if they could deal with that many extra people backstage at the time, so we'd have to wait until the end. Even then, it wasn't definite, so we just left, but she gave us her phone number and told us to let her know if we ever went to another show, so she could give her friend a heads up.    Haha, I just looked over my last entry from my date with Ryan. You know what's interesting about this situation? That we talked and talked and talked on Saturday and on Monday, he made eye contact with me in the hallway and then immediately looked down. Today, I walked into history and he was the only person in the room. I said "Hey! How are you?" and he didn't answer me. I honestly don't know how the hell to deal with this. I'm really rather offended.

      I had a date with Ryan tonight. He's been soooo ridiculously nice and polite to me for the last couple of days and definitely was tonight. We actually did talk quite a bit, and there were only a couple awkward silences. He's "really looking forward to prom."  We saw Eternal Sunshine. I must say, though, that watching Jim Carrey masturbate is slightly uncomfortable when you watch with a guy...  I'm sooo happy. He's so terribly nice and pretty.

      I just backed into my neighbor's friend's car...I feel like a complete moron. I don't think there's any damage - to either car, but it is dark. There's a tire that sticks out on the back of the SUV, though. I've kind of...backed into things before, and that sticks out the farthest. It doesn't cause any damage. I wasn't going fast either...Shit, I feel so paranoid. I should've said something...  I was sooo happy when I was on my way out, too! I had just called Ryan and asked him if he wanted to do something this weekend. We talked for a couple of minutes and he brought up prom stuff. "Next week, do you want to go with me to get prom tickets and choose seats?" It was super; he talked to me!! On his own!   Then, I had to go ruin it by backing into that car. Superb!

      makes me want to puke.  I hate the summertime. I hate falling into this utterly horrible depression every summer. I thought it would be different this year. It isn't. In fact, it's started earlier than usual.

      I hung out with Kat, Evan, and Corey all day today.  We went to the Pavillions to see The Day After Tomorrow.  Evan and Corey were late as hell, and Corey ended up sitting next to this creepy guy dressed like a chef with a bag of knives. Really, he had knives. I saw them.   The movie was cheesy. "Tell her how you feel." They should've all frozen to death. Well, not Jake. He's too beautiful to die.   After that, we stopped in at Banana Republic before our reservations because our chemistry teacher works there. She asked us if we were on a double date. Likely. I really enjoy how our science teachers like to think they're young and hip and really interested in our personal lives.  So, we walked to P.F. Chang's. Evan and Corey are really bad at directions. We were late for our reservations, but it didn't matter.  After we ate, we went shopping on 16th Street.  Kat, Corey, and I pretended we were French whenever an annoying beggar came up to us. Really we have no sympathy.  This one guy came up to us and asked for $13 for a youth hostile. He looked way too old for a youth hostile. But he called us rude because WE wouldn't GIVE HIM money...Evan and Corey didn't put up the slightest fight being dragged into Express and Forever 21 with Kat and I. We wanted to see how far we could push them, so we walked into Victoria's Secret. Apparently, that was their limit. We went into Barnes and Noble and Evan bought the Metrosexual's Guide to Style. Kat and I recommended it, of course. We made him follow the chivalry rules for the rest of the night.  We couldn't figure out what else to do downtown, so we decided to see what dance thing was going on at the Mercury. Apparently, it was tango, and Kat and Evan were game but Corey and I really didn't want to. We're going back on a Thursday so we can swing dance.   I had a lot of fun. I'm glad to be hanging out with new people, and this is all kind of exciting and interesting.  I have so much fun with Evan and Corey.     So, last night, it took Evan and I over an hour to figure out what we were going to do today.  What we ended up doing was actually our original plan. He hits on me quite a lot sometimes...it's just becoming more noticeable. I said that my sister and I were a lot alike. He said that the world should only be so lucky. Tgere was something else, too. I can't quite remember what it was, but I recall me telling him that he couldn't become all nice and suddenly be very complimentary to me. He had to be mean sometimes I told him, for old time's sake.  He said he'd get someone else to fill the position.    We're going downtown for that Buskerfest thing at the end of this month...Before then, too, I guess, with the whole swing dancing thing at the Mercury...   What am I doing?

      Okay, so Kat wasn't drunk, but she sure as hell was high.  After Evan went back in to the party after I left, Kat asked him if he went home with me.  Honestly...

      Well, today was the last day of my junior year! I'm a senior! Holy crap! I don't know what to think about this. It's kind of cool, but definitely kind of not....  I went to Tay's continuation.  My old vice principal asked me to come speak to next year's sixth graders at their continuation because I'll have graduated then.  I'm in love with her son, by the way. That's one more reason for me to go to Penn. (Oh, and because I'm going to go visit at the same time as Evan)  Rafer's end-of-the-year party was today. I still haven't reached a verdict.  It was just kind of odd. I got there at the same time as Adrienne and we just stood around for a while.  She ditched me to play Frisbee and flirt with some guy who just graduated.  Ryan appeared...I didn't know he was going. In all actuality, I kind of lied to him.  I told him Adrienne and I had plans for tonight when he asked me if I wanted to go to the party with him.  In all honesty, I was sort of hoping he wouldn't go because I knew Evan was going.  I know it's bad. I know it is. I can't help it...  So, when everyone left to go play Frisbee (including both Evan and Ryan) Marcus and I hung out, and hung all over one another, actually. It's cool, though. It's just Marcus. He and I are getting married and going to go to college in RI together. He's going to let me eat all of his homework from cooking school. He's listened to all of my Ryan/Evan problems and just kind of held me. Someone asked me what was up with Marcus and I...Hahaha...There is NO Marcus and I. He's a good guy, and we're becoming friends.    My confusion really began once the Frisbee game ended.  Both Evan and Ryan came back from the game and both of them seemed to have found me.  Meanwhile, I'm just standing there with Marcus' arm around my waist...Then 3 other guys just stand there...I feel like such a dirty skank.  When did I become so interesting?  Everytime Ryan talked to me tonight, we would both say a few words and then stand there awkwardly...I really do like him, I do...He doesn't deserve this kind of crap from me. He's such a nice guy...He's been really great to me. He just seems so uninteresting/uninterested at times.    Once Ryan decided to leave relatively early on in the night, Evan got more comfortable being around me.  At one point, I was just sitting with Marcus on one of Rafer's lawn chairs and Evan came over and sat down with us.  He also tried to get me to go dance with him.  I did once.  He put his hand on my back and gently guided me into the house.  He'd go walk around and talk to people, trying to make it look as though he wasn't trying to talk to just me. I was slightly irritated, though, that everytime Evan came over to talk to me, the other Nicole was there.  Back to my story, though...when he was sitting with me, he started hinting at me dancing with him by asking me to teach him to dance because he's terrible.    Right before I left, though, Evan had a collision (literally) with Corey, and lost his phone in the battle that ensued.  Someone picked it up and asked me to whom it belonged. I realized it was Evan's and kept it from him. He didn't really try to get it back, but I went through his phone book anyway.  My number was in it, isn't that cute?  Aaaaanyway, I decided that I was going to leave, and of course, Evan started walking with me to get his phone back.  I gave it back to him about halfway to my car and he walked with me the rest of the way, trying hard to get me to stay for a little while longer.  I said that I couldn't really and needed to go home, but we stood outside just talking for about 10 minutes. It was really nice, actually.      This was the first time Evan had really made such an effort with me...Other than asking me to go to kayak lessons with his group on Thursdays or to go camping with a bunch of IB kids during the summer...or shopping...or to go to UPenn at the same time because it'd be "more fun that way." When I talk to him online, he also suggests that I can't leave him alone and that he truly does like talking to me. I didn't really put any of this together until the other night when Kat asked him what the deal was between the two of us and he said he didn't know, that I hate him.  I guess that went on for a while and he asked about Ryan and I, what he should do.  Kat told him she didn't really know what the deal was, but that I was thinking of letting things fade out with Ryan...Evan asked her if he should just wait. Oh, and he brought Jamba Juice to English for me today.       I honestly have a really good time with Evan.  We get along so well, and I have so much fun with him.  I know what I need to do, but I don't necessarily know how to do it nor do I want to.     Speaking of Evan, Adrienne made me so mad today.  In the library this morning, Evan came over to sit by Dan so they could study for their Spanish final.  Adrienne began to pet Evan's head and ask about the gel he was using in his hair. She then proceeded to tell him to wear his "hot glasses" more often because he looks "really hot in them." I was slightly in shock, considering she and I had just had a discussion about Evan the night before. She is aware that I like him and that things between he and I are strange right now, almost on the verge of something happening after tonight, I suppose.  That isn't the first time she's done that, either. She did this with Ryan, telling me she was helping me get to know him.  When I told her I was thinking of letting things come to an end with Ryan, she stated, "I would be good for Ryan." Honestly, what the hell?      Okay, so other than those goings-on, the party was really lame...There were, of course, numerous people getting high off to the side...Interesting. I'm so dead if my parents smell any of that shit on me.

      I realized that I haven't written in here for nearly a week. That's uncommon for me.  Monday was my ToK presentation. It went well enough, I suppose.   Tuesday, you know, nothing, went on.  Wednesday, Evan and I went with James to Jamba Juice and took our lives in our hands.  The bastard kept making me laugh about how bad James' driving is, so I smacked him one when we got out of the car.   Thursday, again, nothing. Orange days suck. Today was our last real black day. Kat and Dan ditched ToK and we, along with Evan and Joanna went out to eat.  I tried to take one of the ten-ish copies of Evan's paper, and he wouldn't let me, so I grabbed his hand. He said, "Be careful. You'll break the cherry in my hand." Before I knew it, I looked at my hand and it was covered in cherry juice. Honestly, who holds cherries in their hands? I came home, and went to see Troy with Lydia, Kat, Ryan, and Kathy.    Ryan is slightly awkward, but I really enjoy his company when he's outside of school. It's odd. It only makes me more confused.   Evan has been trying to convince me all week that I should go camping with him and some other people this summer. Well, he claims I don't have a choice in the matter. It's on his to-do list to make me a more outdoorsy person, and once someone is on his list, they don't get off the list until he accomplishes his goal, according to him. I'd really like to see him try.  I told him I most likely wouldn't be going. He made it a point to come tell me today that Lyd had decided to go, so I should go too. He actually ran after me.  He also is trying to get me to go on this really long hike with him and a bunch of other people. He's insane. He invited me to go with him to some kayaking lessons on Thursday, and apparently I'm invited every Thursday now.    I'm a really bad person, though.  I invited Evan to go see Shrek with my group that's going after we get done with graduation tomorrow, and I didn't ask Ryan.  I don't know what's going on in my head. Kat and I talked about this during chemistry, in French so Ryan couldn't tell what we were saying.  She told me to stop fighting the Evan thing. I might take her advice. I mean, if I'm going to act on this, it should be before things with Ryan actually work out.    I really honestly have been wondering why Evan's been inviting me so many places, insisting I go.  He said that he likes talking to me, not in those words exactly, but yeah...I've been up talking to him to at least 12 every night. It's getting so strange...

      After that last entry, I stayed up another hour talking to Evan.    Yesterday, Adrienne and I hung out most of the day. After the orchestra/choral concert, we went to the mall and shopped for a little while.  Ryan called me while we were shopping and asked if I wanted to go do something.  I told him I probably couldn't (since I was out with Adrienne that would've been rude) Then Adrienne remembered there was that record label opening/concert type thing, so I called him back and asked if he wanted to go with us. Adrienne took me back home so I could change and we waited for Ryan.    Once we got there, we waited around for it to start and once it did, it turns out that half of th bands that were playing REALLY sucked.      Ryan's really frustrating. I know for a fact that he likes me. Clearly, he does. I mean, he wouldn't ask me out every weekend if he didn't.  I really just don't understand where we stand.  I was sitting really close to him, touching actually.  Despite the lack of space really, he was so distant.  At one point, he was sitting with his hands behind him, and I was getting uncomfortable with the way I was sitting, so I put my hands behind me, too. I accidentally brushed his hand with mine, and he moved his away! I couldn't help getting pissed, so I tried to move away from him subtley so he didn't really know I was mad. I seriously don't understand him.

      It's 1:13 AM and I've been talking to Evan since about 11:30ish.  What the hell am I doing?  I stayed up until 12 last night to talk to him. We're friendly, and that's good, I think. It should stay like that.  Ryan won! Who knew?! I'm so thrilled! Different people deserve to be in it. I really can't picture him doing all of their spirit-related crap, though.

      Hmmm... I got out of my tok presentation today. Now I'll have a chance to memorize it before Monday. It was fortunate. Then Lydia spilled chocolate soy milk on my foot. It was beautiful.    Ryan is nuts. He's running for senior senate. It's out of character for him as he's typically "anti-school functions".  I dunno if he'll win or not. I feel compelled to vote now. I have never voted in the senate elections at school. In fact, I'm morally opposed to it.       I don't know where we stand, really. I mean, maybe he's my boyfriend. I really just don't know what's going on there. We don't really talk. When we do talk, it's about school, or something related to school. Other than that, there's silence. It's not exactly awkward, but silence is still silence. He seems to lack personality at times...I don't know. Maybe he's still slightly uncomfortable with me...   The thing is, all of this is amplified in my mind when Evan is around. We talk alot, about things that aren't even school-related. There are no awkward silences when he's around, and he's so interesting. He's lively and he has tons of personality.  I was talking to Kat about this tonight, she brought it up actually. Evan and I might go shopping this weekend, no big deal, but she's curious as to where he and I stand as well. That's a curious question. I think she was just as confused as I am. I'm such a dipshit. I mean, I have things with Ryan going exactly the way I wanted them. I think her confusion rested with the fact that I've met Ryan's family and we're pretty much dating right now.  It's really stupid for me, and it's practically cheating, to pursue anything with Evan, even though that's unlikely currently. She also whined about being jealous of me because I always get the guy. I told her that didn't come without trying. With Ryan I tried. With Evan, that was natural progression, but who knows...We talked about Evan for a while. "When did he get hot?!"   Haha, Evan waxes his eyebrows. Lydia brought it up today. He had an explanation, but still, weirded out yo. His eyebrows are better than mine. Lydia and Kat like to tease about the sexual tension, so Lydia claims he did it out of his love for me. She definitely does not find the sexual tension jokes as funny as I do. She said they're cruel and what if he really does like me? Why is everything so weird?????

      I had an awesome weekend, actually. It was amazing!  I went to that concert on Friday night, of course.  Saturday, I did go out to dinner with Ryan's family. I met his mom, stepdad, grandma, and sister.  They were all so cute. His grandmother was especially adorable. He was so embarrassed the entire time, but I thought they were funny. He apologized profusely afterward.  We all went to his sister's piano recital, and Ryan and I stayed for a while before going to a movie.   Sunday, Ryan went to my violin recital. He brought me flowers. Isn't that cute? My mom was really nice to him, but I know she was uncomfortable.   So now, it's back to the shitty week.

      Tonight was fun. We went to a concert. Local bands. The last one, Some Kind of Hero, was absolutely wonderful. Then, they started preaching to us. I was not amused.   My AP/IB exams are over now. Whoot. History went veeeery badly. Math could've gone better, but I'm sure I passed. That's the only one I MUST pass. AP Eng Lit was terrible, too.   Ryan called me before I got home today. Apparently he wanted to go do something, but by the time I called him back, he was back in Evergreen. Evergreen is far away... He asked me if I wanted to go out to dinner with him, his mom, his sister, and his grandma tomorrow night. I'm all like, "Weirded out, yo..." But I think it's cute. Maybe he does think more of this situation than I do. I was not prepared for that.   Long day tomorrow. Volunteer training. 2 hour-ish lesson. Homework. Dinner. Then Ryan wanted to go do something with me afterward.

      My current frustration: Ryan v. Evan  Yes, yes, that's right. i am once again confused.  Ryan and I went to prom together and it was wonderful. Including prom, we've gone out together about 3 times.  He's really a beautiful person - figuratively and literally.  He's extremely polite. He's fantastic, actually. He's been trying so hard to make an effort with me, and I feel really at ease with him once I can get him talking.  The fact of the matter, however, is that while we are sort of dating, I know that I'm not his girlfriend.   Enter Evan.  The two of us get along very well.  We have a free block together, meaning we talk for nearly 2 hours every other day.  (Note for demonstrative purposes: One day, Luke asked Evan to take him to lunch. Evan had a a bike in the backseat of his Explorer and only one free seat.  He told me that he had to move the bike to the rack anyway and spent 15 minutes doing so, just so I could go with him.  He told me he had to anyway, even though later that afternoon, he still only needed the one seat.  The drive took less time than it took him to move the bike.)  We always go through these weird, childish moments.  Everyday actually. Yesterday, I was called on it.   Evan sat there with me, teasing me and taking my belongings as usual.  I'd try to get them back, having to give him a light smack or hold onto his hand to pry something out of it.  When Evan left, Peng-Peng exclaimed disgustedly, "Well, that was a lovely display of flirting, Nicole!" Then, Kat chimed in, "Oh my God, Nicole! It's so cute! You two flirt sooo much. He flirts with you so much, and you do it too!  It's okay, though, because I know you're madly in love with Ryan!" That went on for a long time.  Today, I told Evan about all of that and he practically freaked out.  He's like, "I don't even know how to do that."  Yeah...so, he protested that for a while, and then we went to Jamba Juice. We continued to screw with each other...yeah, yeah, yeah...  When we got back to school, Kat was getting back.  She exlaimed yet again (to Evan, this time), "You guys are soooo cute!!! There's soooo much sexual tension between you." That went on and on as we walked back into school. "It's okay, it's so cute, and Nicole's going to marry Ryan anyway.  You guys are like brother and sister, except you really want to have sex." Evan is so utterly freaked out now.   I'm not going to lie. I like Evan.  I have liked Evan for a fairly long time.  In fact, I probably began liking him at about the same time my Ryan liking came about.  I don't know how I chose one over the other, I just did.  And actually, before yesterday, I didn't really interpret any of the dumb little things we do as flirting.  But - since according to well, everyone at that table, that's what has been going on, this makes things more problematic now, though.   1. Ryan      - I don't know how he feels about things between us right now.  I don't know if he interprets it to be more/less/the same as/than I do.  Regardless, I have no intention of hurting him. I'm still quite smitten with him, and I would like things to continue.  No one deserves that kind of crap.       - It's dumb to have tried so hard to win him over if I'm not going to let things continue.  2. Evan     - I don't want to put him in a position where he can interpret my actions as flirtation if I'm in no position to do so (meaning if Ryan and I did become "exclusive")     - It's not fair for him to waste his energies on me if I can't/shouldn't reciprocate.     - I'm kind of curious as to what's going to happen next...  3. Nicole     - Ryan is WONDERFUL!     - ...so is Evan...     - It's dumb to ruin something that could happen with Ryan when I don't even know what Evan really thinks.     - I don't want to hurt either of them.       - Ryan isn't my boyfriend.            Technically, since nothing is official.  I DO have free will...     - The way I act with Evan and the relationship we have (albeit weird) is fun.     - This is completely innocent.   If this is really flirting, which I'm not sure that it is, there is a simple solution to all of the implied problems. I have to stop goofing off, screwing around, whatever...with Evan.

      I went out with Ryan tonight. I had fun. He's so cool. The whole "politeness" thing is still there, too. I dunno, it's slightly odd. He hasn't even tried to hold my hand yet. He walked me to my door, though. AND he's going to my recital next week. Isn't that rad?      That guy I used to be crazy about, who shall remain nameless here, seems sort of...well, jealous of Ryan and I. Well, I'm not sure if it's quite jealousy. It kind of seems like he just dislikes Ryan. He makes it seem like he really wants me now (Of course, right? My feelings have changed. This couldn't have been a few months ago.), but he also makes it seem like it's some sort of competition between the two of them that he's confident he'd win.  I dunno, maybe it's all in jest.

      I'm so very pissed at my sister. She's so insensitive and inconsiderate of others. We were screaming at one another, and I'll admit that I hit her on her back a few times. My hitting her was a result of her throwing hot water on me which made me fall and practically break my frigging knee cap. This was because she called me a bitch because I wouldn't go help out my mom at the restaurant, but somehow it was okay for her not to go. It's so hypocritical, really. She then sat online for three and a half hours so I couldn't use the phone or the computer just to spite me.  After screaming at her and jumping around like an idiot, I took some sleeping pills, of which I'm feeling the effects of right now. I made some interesting scratches on my arms with some scissors, but I couldn't bring myself to break the skin. I couldn't find a new, clean razor blade.    The Youth Commission is going to shit.   Buskerfest and my day downtown were a bust.   My friends are back from their vacations. They all suck. I saw Adrienne yesterday at Starbucks where she was meeting Skanky Danielle, whom she greeted with much more enthusiasm than she greeted me. I was offended. For that reason and due to the fact that she talked to Danielle during her vacation and I thought we were better, closer friends than the two of them. Kat called me as soon as she got back from the airport today and then proceeded to say nothing because she was online. (I could hear the noises of IM). Cassiope was supposed to get back tonight and she hasn't even called to say thank you for feeding her dogs and bringing in her mail for 8 days. I'm really irritated with all three of them for being so rude and inconsiderate. I can't stand it. I was alone and bored for a solid week and they get back and act like that...Guys are much easier to be friends with. There's no crap with them. They're succinct and to the point. I commend them for that.  I'm so stressed out, and it's freaking summertime. This isn't normal...  I need to get some sleep as my pills are kicking in and I still need to finish my dinner.

      Oooh, Sounds hot, doesn't it? lol... Oh silly Evan has given me horrible mental images. Okay, actually, the mental images are pretty good...What? Did I just say that?  He's such a strange kid. I like him so much.   I've been doing nothing as of late. Steven and I went to see Dodgeball the other night. It was the 2nd time I've seen it, since I got in free with the city at that benefit last Tuesday. He was making fun of me because my Jamba was giving me weird jaw pains. Sympathetic friend, eh?  My mom bought me a ton of SAT prep books yesterday...She spent over $100 on that stuff. My first SAT score blew. 1320. *checks* Yep, that blows.   I think Jen and I are going swing dancing tomorrow night, if I can find a partner. Evan says he'll go. Well, he said that a week ago. I doubt he actually will. Kayaking class or something... Everytime I suggest a partner to take my sister gets really angry at me and says, "Ryan" really slowly as if I'm retarded. Well, I am. I'll give her that. I refuse. Maybe I'll ask Marcus if Evan doesn't want to go.

      That's what every single car of a passing train said when I saw it the other day. It was amusing.   Let's see...I haven't been up to much...  Thursday I went swing dancing. It was actually fun until open dancing started. The lesson was a lot of fun except for having to dance with much, much older men who were really condescending if you messed up the steps. It was my first time! Some of them were really nice and helpful about it. One thirty-something guy told me my hair smelled terrific, which made me insanely uncomfortable for the rest of the lessons.The open dancing was horrendous. I had major ugly duckling syndrome, and Cassiope ignored me the entire time so she could flirt with some really ugly guy. She didn't even bother to introduce him to me or attempt to include me in anyway. Rather, she just stood off to the side. Kat didn't get there until an hour later than she said she would, so I had no one to talk to and sat there like an idiot. Kat got there, I spoke to her briefly and left. I had fun learning, but I will never again go unless I have a partner. I should've asked Marcus to go like I had originally intended. I owe him an outing thing and he wouldn't have abandoned me.  That bitch actucally called me today and asked me to keep an eye on her pets (all 4 of them) for the week. I'm doing it for the animals...If I didn't love animals so much, bitch would be out of luck.    Today I went to work with my mom so I could hang out with Mya. Whoot. She's adorable, but honestly, I could've lived without seeing Garfield. I did get her to say "drop it like it's hot" and "flip it down and reverse it" in cute, adorable little girl speak.  Um, Ryan called me and left a message on my voicemail. No, I still haven't called him back from the last time. I had a whole speech worked out to break things off with him, but I left it at home and I wasn't at home when he called. To be honest, I don't really want to break up with him, but I want to be with Evan, and I think that feeling is actually a lot stronger. He said, "It's been a really long time since I've talked to you, and I really miss seeing you." God, why does he make it so much harder for me?

      Marcus called me today while I was cleaning my room. He asked me if I wanted to go do something. I couldn't because I was cleaning, obviously. We ended up talking for 2.5 hours.   He told me that it was really awkward for him watching Evan and I talk after Rafer's party, since he thought that we had had a good time together and we had made some sort of a connection. It was odd to say the least.   I don't need a third right now...

      I only got a 31 on my ACT. When I took the plan, my percentile for reading was 99. This year, it was 84. I know that's because of that damn 5 minutes I was screwed out of. I should've retaken it when they gave us the option. Now I'll have to do it on my own. I want at least a 32 this time.

      anything to say...  I went to the bookstore today. I figure I had better get started on summer homework. I have an assload of stuff to do. I have two books to read for English (with journal entries!), a ToK essay, a ToK book to read (I haven't decided which), French, a book to read for history, a study guide to fill out for history, a visual representation thing for history, my World Lit papers I & II need to be corrected and practically rewritten, and I have to have the first draft of my extended essay done and mailed to Mehlbach by August 1. This never seems like a lot to me until I actually look at my physical homework. This could be the reason that I just sit at the computer all day or go out and do something that isn't my homework.  Hmm...Kat and I are going swing dancing on Thursday and to see Saved on Friday. Adrienne has abandoned us for a skank and a sweet but awesomely boring girl. She told me she would call about doing something after the SAT on Saturday, but she never did, and when people tell me they'll call and then they don't, I don't bother calling them.  But, on that subject, I do need to call Ryan back. I was kind of hoping he had forgotten about me or was deciding to let this phase out when he hadn't called since (I thought) he'd been back. Apparently, according the message on my voicemail, he just got back. I really should return his call. I have to, quite frankly. He called me four times yesterday and I never answered. He called my home number, then my cell. About an hour later, he repeated that process. No sooner did my home phone stop ringing than my cell phone began ringing.  I don't know what I'm doing. Evan's figured out that he's the guy on whom I have a crush, as if he didn't already know. He confides all of his worries about liking me and not knowing what to do about this situation in Kat, and of course, Kat tells me. He's a really anxious kid, as far as I can tell. Bleh, this entire situation sucks.

      I took the SAT today. What a wonderful way to kill four hours of my life.        Ronald Reagan died today. He was 93. I know his policies were lacking, but from what I've seen of his relationship with his wife, it was so cute...I heard that he didn't enter or leave a room without giving her a kiss...

      Christ! Did you see how I spelled "afterwards"? And the worst thing about that is that when I was writing it, I thought that was spelled correctly, so I deleted "afterwards"! Oh my God! I am getting dumber. It's certain!

      I have been reading too much of the Georgia Nicolson books. But on the bright side, I am now the girlfriend of a sex god.  Okay, I'm not. I just wanted to use that title in something...Okay, that sucked. On the real bright side, I've been picking up her speech habits.    Um...let's see  Swing dancing tomorrow with Kat. That should be fun. I've never gone before. Ryan's coming back tomorrow...  The skate park is opening Friday. That'll be interesting. Maybe I can get a nice tan.  There will be a concert afterwords, so that will be rad.   I can't stay too late though as the SATs are Saturday! Kill me now! Oh the anxiety is killing me. I took a practice test today and got a 1410, but only because I didn't time myself and didn't feel like doing the last section so I just picked random answers. Saturday should be fun. Hahaha...   Kat told me she got her ACT score yesterday. That's depressing because she got a 33. So did Dan, although I'm not sure if I believe him. He said he scored better than Kat on the PSAT and he didn't get National Merit, but she did. Now I'm incredibly jealous, even though I don't even know what I scored yet. Christ...It's no excuse for anything, but I was also screwed out of five minutes for this damn thing, so I might retake it if it turns out to disappoint me.    Ah...crappity crap mccrap...

      I wouldn't go to Yale just because I wouldn't want to be called&nbsp;a Yalie.  Cassiope and I went out after the meeting last night. We talked for a couple of hours. It was actually pretty cool. I was amazed.   I was supposed to pick up my mother and sister from Jackie's house at 10:30 and we were there until 1. And whenever my mom's with Jackie, they get smashed, so I wanted to go home and my mom started the "poor little Nicole" thing, which mostly includes that I think my life is so bad and her life was sooooo much worse.   &nbsp; It was a fun night.   &nbsp;

       are all self-indulgent little pricks and I'm so utterly sick of them.    &nbsp;  Current Friendship Annoyances:   1. Kat    &nbsp;- tries much too hard to fit in   &nbsp;- cares only about herself   &nbsp;- isn't at all interested in what's currently happening if something better comes along   &nbsp;- has recently become devoid of any morals whatsoever    &nbsp;  2. Adrienne   &nbsp;- seems to feel that new friends and old friends can't co-exist peacefully   &nbsp;- says she'll call but doesn't   &nbsp;- has recently become devoid of any morals whatsoever   &nbsp;- broken promises as well as empty ones   &nbsp;- has naked parties    &nbsp;  3. Steven   &nbsp;- IMs  me  first and then ceases to talk   &nbsp;- we don't usually hang out, but he invites me to obscure things and seems angry if I don't want to attend   &nbsp;- couldn't have mentioned that he was on the phone while I continued to talk to him, but allowed me to get irritated and then said "hold on, i'm on the phone"     &nbsp;  4. Evan   &nbsp;- isn't around enough...results in withdrawl   &nbsp;- not enough problems with him...ha    &nbsp;  5. Cassiope   &nbsp;- she seems to think that the way she feels about what other people do is how they should live their lives. her morals should be their morals   &nbsp;- otherwise, a good person    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       I haven't written in a while. Blogger's all snazzy now, though, so maybe it's back to this site?    &nbsp;  I haven't exactly been busy lately.    &nbsp;   Summer seems to be winding down. I hate this feeling. The end of summer has some feel to it that seems to be full of mystery and anticipation, like something really great will happen, the kind of feeling you get after hanging out with your friends outside, just sitting and talking . But at the same time, it's a depressing feeling, as if I should be up to more, making things happen on my own, not waiting for them to just happen as if by magic.  &nbsp; I'm not making sense.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ack... &nbsp; Daddy is going to be going in for surgery within a couple months or so. He wasn't insured before because no one would insure him, but apparently it's a law in Colorado that&nbsp;if he were to enter a group insurance thing with my mom, the company would have to insure him.&nbsp; I hope it works because we can't afford a $300,000 surgery.  &nbsp; They're going to go in through his chest and remove some bone spurs and calcium deposits from around his spinal column.&nbsp; That will prevent any further nerve damage, which has been making his leg go numb and making him walk with a limp. &nbsp; He won't get much better than he is now, but he won't get worse. &nbsp; After he's done with his surgery, he'll be unable to do anything for a few months, but after that it's physical therapy for the remainder of that year. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I'm going through snog withdrawl...It's been almost 7 months since my last snog. My god...  It's pathetic...I need a snogging partner. That's really what I want right now. Hmm...maybe Marcus. I'd feel bad, though. He's not in it for the snogging.

      We ate a lot tonight. For Kat's birthday, Dan, Lyd, Cassiope, Nathan, and I took her to Buca di Beppo's for dinner and dessert. It's family style so we ate soooo much. Lydia named Kat Kat "The Eater" Blasco, and we all ended up eating so much that we became a family named "The Eaters". We're going to make a mailbox...  Dinner took three hours. Yessir...THREE hours. We had some interesting pictures.   I went to see Spiderman 2 yesterday with Marcus and Cassiope. It was not my thing. I don't recommend it. I only wanted to hear Dashboard's "Vindicated", for which I had to wait until the very end of the movie. Marcus kept fighting me for the arm rest.   After the movie, we went shopping for Kat's birthday present. I bought her something good and then I was on a quest for something dumb. I bought her a "grow your own boyfriend" thing. The girl behind the counter told me to ask Marcus if he wishes he could do that in water, too.   Lydia and I went shopping once I got home. There are some really cute shops off of 32nd and Lowell. However, she had no luck, and the only thing she wanted to buy Kat was $300...  Um, that's all I've got.   The end.

      I can't get my nerve up to call Ryan. It's been so long now...  I'm going shopping for Kat's birthday present tomorrow. Marcus is going with Cassiope and I.  Peng-Peng insists that Marcus is much better than Evan, but I don't feel that way about him.   I still haven't talked to Evan. I think I'm going through withdrawl. Ack.  I don't know what else to write about...
