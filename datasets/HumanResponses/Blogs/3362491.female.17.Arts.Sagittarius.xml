      Well its been an interesting last couple of days to say the least. I just got home, haven't been home since last Thursday! I went up to the cottage this weekend with my mom and john. janine, Kyle and Madison were supposed to come up around 12 on Saturday. ya rite! lol! We got a phone call around 1:30 and it was Janine, I got talking to her and all of a sudden she just started balling on the phone with me, so Kyle got on the phone with john and they started to talk. I guess Kyle is getting frustrated living where he is. cuz they are living with her parents and I can totally understand why he would be. So the conversation was left that they were going to come up but they just still needed to pack. With in 5 minutes, Kyle called back and he was ready to completely leave her, no questions asked he was getting out of there. My mom talked to both Kyle and janine and my mom convinced them to come up and she would help discuss it and help push it all aside. If janine wanted my mom was going to drive down and get her and the baby and bring them up so her and Kyle didn't have to drive together. So this conversation was left that they were both going to come up and they were going to talk to my mom and john when they got there... An hour or so later, the phone rang again he was on his way up to the cottage with Madison when janine had called him and all she said was I guess ill see you at my funeral. Kyle turned around and my mom had a huge talk with Kyle as he drove home. She told him just give her a big hug and by doing that you are letting her know that you love her. This conversation was left that if they weren't going to come up the cottage then they would call, if they were we would just see them. Around 6:00 the phone rang and everything was fine, they got back together but weren't going to come up to the cottage. Which left me bored outta my mind the entire weekend.   I got home on Sunday and it was planned that I was going to go out to Pickering to hang with Michelle for the night and then Monday during the day. My dad was supposed to drive me at 7:30 when he drops off Britney. We got a call from them at 8:15 that they were just leaving the trailer and would be back in about 2 hours. GREAT! So I got to Michelles' around 11 and we went to the movies and caught dodgeball. It was actually pretty good. Kinda funny! We decided to go to McDonald's after the movie and we sat in the drive thru for 20 minutes, while sitting in line James called Michelles' cell and was like where r u? So me and Michelle were planning on going down to the beach and just chillin down there. Michelle told James and they decided he was going to come down with us too. Don't get me wrong I love James to death but he just ruined the girls night lol! Like I understand completely why he wanted too and that's kool, but the whole night I just felt like I shouldn't be there. We went back and sat in the car and we all fell asleep till about 4.. Actually Michelle was the only one sleeping.. But she doesn't know that. Me and James talked. On the way home Michelle and James were talking about getting together on the Monday and that he was going to come early over to her house.. Michelle invited him which really just pissed me right off.  Monday I woke up by Michelles' brother throwing something at my head. I spent the whole day on about 3 hours of sleep so I was a grump! lol! James called about 3 times that morning and Michelle spent about 2 hours talking to him on the phone... Enough time for me to watch drumline all the way through its a 2 hour movie. Then I got dressed and about 30 minutes after they hung up he was there. It was awkward and defeated the whole purpose of coming down for a girls night. I was pissed, REALLY PISSED!  so Monday night I went back to my grandma's because me and James were going to hang out on the Tuesday (today). That wasn't to bad. About a month ago I left my CD player at Michelles' with my CD I listen to when I'm really pissed. So I got that back the night before from her and was planning on listening to it to calm down lol! I open it up and my CD wasn't there and it was one of James which is kool cuz its good music, but it was funny cuz she lied to me she was like ya I have your CD and you have mine. First off its James' CD and James has it. She just really pissed me off this weekend and I hope I Don't have to talk to her any time soon cuz I might flip.   today I woke up by James calling me. We decided to meet at the big m's cuz I Don't remember how to get to his house (its complicated) so just as I was about to leave it started to poor out... Just my luck right? Actually I Don't mind the rain its always good... (its hot to make out in too! lol!) so we met up and we walked back to his house and just chilled on the couch in his basement watching TV it was awesome! It actually made me not think about the rest of the weekend with Michelle. We talked about that for awhile today, how Michelle is really pissing off James, it doesn't look good. :S   I got home read a million emails... I got one from Chad... I haven't heard from in ever! He lives up near my cottage and we met about 3 years ago in a chat line and we've been friends ever since... So I think this weekend we're gonna chill.. If I go up to my cottage.   Brent and Shawn come back in 3 days. I cant wait to hear all about the trip. I'm sure they are having a blast.

      Wow I haven't wrote in a while! There's been a lot going on in the past week when I think of it. The 19th was my dance recital and it was awesome!! We all did so good, but then came to the realization that we have to say good bye to a few. We all sat on the stage for an hour after the show just hugging and crying. The night before recital I pulled an all nighter working on a scrap book I put together for Kim. Basically it was just to say how much we all love to dance, love her and/ or the studio. Personally I don't know what I would do without it, its my escape from my dramatic life. So I presented to her during recital.   afterwards we all went to my aunts for my moms birthday dinner. It was fun but I was exhausted, I passed out at some point. I've finally finished grade 12 and most likely returning for another semester and going to new York in the end of January. I'm so excited! I want to go so bad. This time There's nothing holding me back. You know its weird in the last couple days, I've given myself a make over, not on looks but my personality. I'm tired of living each day with regret and for someone else... I'm glad I finally came to realize this for myself... There's been a few ppl that have been telling me this for quite awhile. I guess you could say I'm making a  PACT  with myself.   today all the girlies from dance went shopping! It was awesome and great fun!! They're hilarious!! We had a good talk... Yup lol! But anyways I'm off to the cottage tomorrow with janine, Kyle and baby Madison.. It will be fun!! Then I'm off to Michelles for the nite and then staying at my grandma's which should be followed by what is going to be a promising day... ;);) wink wink!! lates

      Today was interesting. I started the day off by being awakened by my cousins dog, max. Today was the one year anniversary since my grandma past away. So I realized today what I get to look forward to in the next month or so, a lot of tears.  I am doing this thing for Kim at the studio. I memory book kind of idea to let her know how much we enjoy being there and how much she has impacted our lives, not only as a teacher but as a friend. She has help we with so many things and just made me realize that I have to do what feels right and not let the bad influence my decisions anymore, it only causes problems. So today I went shopping for all of the supplies and started to have her students sign it... 3/276! I have along way to go in a week. ohh jeeze a week, that's retarded exactly a week from today and right now... Dance is going to be over.. *tear* I haven't heard from York yet, and its pissing me off so I phoned there today. The office was closed and they told me to call back on Monday, which is also the deadline to let schools know on your decisions. I'm kinda pissed off. So it looks like another semester at Henry. Maybe that way I can pass biology! after dance today we all got together and partied. After a lot of tears. lol! a lot of these people I've been dancing with since I was 3. Its crazy to think that I might not be there next year and am going to lose them. I just might die. They keep my head on straight. that's the best part of dance, we can all be ourselves. So after we all cried me and James hung out for awhile, always good. lol! He's awesome. ohh wiggle wiggle!! lol *-) I'm kinda mellow lol! Just like meh whatever kind of moods. But I'm frustrated at the same time. Cause I cant have what I want.  DAMMIT!  lol its all good! Like always I'm rambling but I don't really care you can keep on reading what I have to say lol!  schools almost over, its going to be an upsetting week all around. a lot of my close friends are all going off and other people that I have got close too there's the chance I'm never going to see them again. Its sad and scary. But I don't know I think its time for school to be over. I'm ready to leave and have myself an awesome summer.  I'm flying down to PEI with my grandma in august to visit my grandpa.. *tear* like I said I have a lot to look forward too in the next month. But the part I get to look forward too is the fact I'm going to be doing it alone. I can see myself running away from everything important to me, someone stop me. I hate it when I run away from things, I guess I'm just not strong enough to deal with it,(thanx to a special someone) so I push it aside... Like always! Anyways I'm going to go to bed now, its kind of late.

      Hey Hey I tried to post an entry yesterday and my computer being retarded froze. It was in the middle of one of the greatest rants of all time. I went out to dinner with my Dad last night, and let me tell you he just distroyed me and pulled me apart. he compared me to my desolate uncles with in my family and told me i was just like them in every way. I'm disrespectful and rude, and he was ashamed to call me his daughter. But see i was willing to talk to him last night and clear things up untill he began calling me all of that. Thats when my walls rised and everything he said went in one ear and out the other. I told him i believed our relationship was the way it was because i was a teenager and want to spend time with my friends rather then with my parents. Thats all i had to say to him so he drove me home and i hugged him goodbye. This time it was for good though! i have no place for him in my life, if he has nothing nice to say about me or to me. The way our relationship isnt just my fault, its his too! if he actually gave a fuck about me and britney than maybe he wouldnt be where he is now.   the last couple weeks me and my mom have been talking because my dad has stopped paying support. We've talked about how he cheated the government into believing he had no income comming in so he wouldnt have to pay support. Which really pissed me off. Theres been alot of talk lately that ive heard, which just says that he doesnt give a fuck and doesnt wanna take the responsiblity of having to children. he doesnt want to pay the money to support us, he cant get off the drugs and everytime i see him hes drinking. I've had enough of it.   A couple weeks ago i asked him if he could pick me up from the mall and drive me to ryans house (which is 2 seconds away from the mall driving but a killer walk). and all he said to me was "I have better things to do." and tell me again why im suppost to love him and want to spend time with him. I know society sets up perfect families and how they should interact adn they tell us that we should love our parents. I mean i love my mom to death, but no way do i have ANY feelings for me dad at all.   he pushed me over the edge last summer. Telling me i wasnt going any where in life, so i should just stop trying. What encoragement ehh? he told me that dance was a waste of time and of my mothers money. which brings me to another point. my dad told my mom back in september that he would start paying her for some of my dance classes, because they are really expensive. he paid $100 which went no where but too a pair of pointe shoes which lasted me 2 monthes. I pay over  2500 dollars on dance a year. so we were sitting at dinner last night and talking about britney. we were talking about how she should go into hockey next year and he was just like "and i dont have a problem paying for it."  It just pisses the hell outta me. dont have double standards and you have TWO daughters not ONE.. but i dont care i can pay for them myself if i need too! Hes helping to pay for my sisters tuition into trafalger but wont pay a cent into my university. Thanx Dad For Being Nothing!

      11 more days till my big party. I can't wait and I'm counting down the days. I'm just in one of those mellow happy moods, yup thats the best way I can describe this one. I went up the cottage over the weekend and it was awesome! Janine and Kyle came up and brought the baby. I spent the whole weekend either with Madison or those 2 doing stuff i shouldn't, but it was awesome. The last week has just been like that, drinking and partying. I went wake boarding again and the water was pretty good so I stayed up for more then 5 minutes it was great. Dave is going to try and come up some time soon, I love spending time with him and getting to know him better. I think Kris said it best "I have the new relationship glow" and i do, I'm happy and I havent been able to say that for awhile. Theres something about Dave that just brings me back to the way i used to be before this past year. I'm happy!!  I got an email from someone which i dont know if i should be mentioning this but i will... its not like anyone reads this anyways! Kelvin got a hold of my email some how and he just sent me an email saying that he missed me. I didnt respond and if theres another one then im gonna go to the cops. so we will see what happens i suppose. Thats the next step for me, telling Dave about my past, I wouldnt be surprised if he left me rite there but i gotta do it rite? exactly! anyways im gonna go have a shower..

      I'm Back! It's been an awesome week with the girls and there boys. We went up to the pinary near Grand Bend. It was amazing and the beaches were just gorgeous. Me, Michelle, Dave and James ended up being the only ones who went up. Which was good because we had more time together and doing what we wanted. Wednesday we went into town and watched the beach volleyball and shopped around. I bought a new bathing suit its pink and pretty! but i dont really feel like talking about all that actually dont feel like talking about anything... im just in a good mood:)

      I just wanted to write a quick update before I left to go away for the week. Dave reassured everything tonite and made me feel so much better about everything that's been going on. I was supposed to get together with him tomorrow but cant there's been a change of plans :( ohh well. I get home either Friday night or Saturday morning it should be an interesting couple of days. I'm going camping with a few friends from Pickering, Dave, Ryan, Michelle, Kris, Lauren, James, Adam. Couples all the way all week. I'm so excited I can't wait to just get out of here for a week with no drama and chaos. We leave early Tuesday morning and get to Grand Bend around 1. Then head to the beach all day!! YAY! Anyways I should go I have to get up early and still pack. The only thing packed so fair is my bathing suits... Most important thing all week, minus the alcohol!! Nite

      Its a late Saturday afternoon and I'm exhausted. I spent a majority of today sleeping and thinking about my short future. I came to the realization last night that in a little over a year, I'm not going to be here. That scares me. I think I'm using this entry to write about my fears. I've been trying the last couple of months to be strong, and I have been. But reality came and hit me right in the face last night. Everything has been going so great lately with me and I don't want it to stop. It feels like I've finally got a handle on my life and know what I want. Which is huge because it isn't that same things they were 5 months ago, even 2 months ago. My priorities have finally been straightened out, and I'm proud of that. No more of my stupid thinking and wishing on something that won't ever happen. I've spent a lot of time talking to Dave the last couple days, and I've just learnt so much from him. He's an awesome person and I don't know why he would choose someone like me to spend time with. He's just a breath of fresh air and so real, something that I really need. I originally said that I didn't want to spend my last couple months with any one and having them feel sorry for me and themselves. But I realized I need him.  And  I&#8217;d give up forever  to touch you  &#8217;Cause I know that you feel me somehow  You&#8217;re the closest to heaven  that I&#8217;I'll ever be  And I don&#8217;t wanna go home right now   And all I can taste  is this moment   And all I can breathe  is your life   And sooner or later it&#8217;s over  I just don&#8217;t wanna miss you tonight   And I don&#8217;t want the world to see me  &#8217;Cause I don&#8217;t think that  they&#8217;d understand    When everything&#8217;s made to be broken  I just want you to know who I am    And  you can't fight the tears  that ain't comin' Or the  moment of truth  in your lies When everything feels like the movies Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive  And I don&#8217;t want the world to see me  &#8217;Cause I don&#8217;t think that  they&#8217;d understand   When everything&#8217;s made to be broken  I just want you to know who I am (x3)  I just want you to know who I am  I just want you to know who I am  I just want you to know who I am  I just want you to know who I am,   *I just need him to be apart of my life. Without knowing how sick I am. It seems like everyone knows, when I originally didn't want any one to know. They don't understand. I need him to be there for me knowing nothing and knowing exactly who I am without any judgments on my health. Eventually he can find out, as for now,   everything is perfect
