       urlLink www.adultfund.com  Jenna jameson has set up a fund for porn stars affected by an HIV outbreak within the Straight Porn Industry, which has been notorious for its lack of condom use in many studios. God Bless Jenna! :)

      So I've become addicted to  urlLink Friendster.com ... I know that its been around for a bit, but they're making small changes, it seems to run smoother most of the time, and its embarassingly fun to scroll through your own personal Six Degrees of Separation.  My friends list is comprised of Old Friends, Old Flames, girls, boys, drag queens and trannies.   I hate Omarosa. She's Evil. Plain and simple, pure EVIL.  Watching the finale of The Apprentice, I can't believe how much I became addicted to that show :)

      Ok so i'd been keeping a web journal for almost two years and got tired of the format, the name, the connections it had in my memory to a life i'd left behind.  So here I am, starting fresh and new with a Blog. Yippeee! test test test... testicular, testosterone, testament...    Naked City Boys... because NakedCity was already taken, because nyc is, like Israel is to Whitney, "My Land!!" (one could wonder whether poor Whitney even knew where she was... probably thought she was at the Beverly Hills Center or something) Anyway, like I said, this is my first post, a test. test test. Is this thing on?

      I guess our time here at the place we're at now is almost up.  We don't see eye to eye with our bosses and there are a lot of things that they're irked at us about, and a lot of things that we're irked at them about.  Its a frustrating situation having your bosses also play a part in your living situation, the fact that you never escape from work is an unbearable predicament.  Its been too long that I've been in this uncomfortable place of not being in control of my surroundings.  I hate that.    I was going through a box of photographs and found one i'd taken of Michelangelo's statue of David.  He was only 25 years old when he started that damn statue, a year younger than I am now.   urlLink This  is the best summary I could find... "an ideal male form combining heroic strength and human uncertainty" I remember being on a guided tour of the Accedemia and the tour guide commenting on how large the hands were in proportion to the rest of his body.  (some suggest it was intentional, depicting his strength; others that it was originally meant for a church facade and would have appeared normal from a distance... you decide) Its funny how the statue has been called pornographic, been censored, stoned, attacked by a hammer, all cuz its a statue of a naked guy.  hm.

      Siting here watching Halle Berry on "Oprah" ... well not ON Oprah, not physically *on* Oprah, but on The Oprah show.  Oprah has worked herself into this interesting position where she can get Big Celebrities to *dish* the way regular talk show hosts can only get "regular" people to dish.  Halle Berry talking about her husbands sex additction... how he cheated on her with "woman after woman after woman after woman" (good move dumbass, cheating on Halle Berry is almost as retarded as Billy Bob cheating on Angelina).  The other day i caught twice divorced Lionel Richie and adopted daughter Nicole Richie talking about his inability to stay married and her old habit of SMOKING HEROIN. Tomorrow George Michael spills his guts about the bathroom incident and about being in the closet for far too long.  What is this? Ricki Lake for famous people?   I'm sitting here mulling over what this blog should be. A place for me to ramble about stupid shit like Oprah? Should I talk about my life, my work, my opinions?? My life is fragmented into so many different compartments, work, friends, family, me... its hard to combine all of those different aspects of myself into one cohesive unit... who i am is never defined by where i am in my life, if that makes any sense.   I'm planning on doing a blog overhaul over the next couple days... some spring cleaning, renovating... making this blog my own. :)

      Hiya!  (song in my head: "one day i'll flyyyy away... leave all this to yesterday... why live life from dreeeeeeeeam to dreeeeeam..." Nicole Kidman - Moulin Rouge)  I've made a promise to myself that I will try and write an entry in here every day.   I always think that I don't have anything interesting to say but i *do*, because all of a sudden i'm waiting to hear back about a Rental Application that i sent in, I'm dancing in my underwear on stage at a bar that shall remain nameless, and i'm getting ready to Go Away From Here.  soon. We'll see how everything goes... here it is, the day of the final episode of Friends, and there is so much going on in my life that it sorta took a backseat to my REAL friends.  Oh Phoebe, Rachel, Monica, and the boys, i'll miss ya, sure i will, but I'm preparing to start my own adventure of sorts and I have to make sure everything goes according to the PLAN.    I talked to an old friend today online for a bit, my first real Boyfriend actually... we dated back in the mid-1940's or something like that, and it was odd to catch up and see that he's still the same guy, but we've both aged about 60 years... (i've aged more than him somehow... and i haven't figured that out yet)  but its was GOOD to reconnect with bits of my past,  the good bits anyway.   Because i've moved around a lot i'm easy to lose track of, and there are a lot of people i've lost touch with.   i guess in a blog you're supposed to be making weblinks to other things... blah... i don't feel like doing that right now.  xoxox jeff

      Lots of news, no news... can't say anything yet... its sorta like the "big twist" on Big Brother, if i tell you what it is, it won't be a big twist anymore, right?  Poor Mary-Kate.  what can I say? i feel bad for the girl. poor little rich girl.  But even though i am jealous of her millions, she's been working for over 17 years, and she just turned 18. Thats ridiculous.  Hopefully after I have been working for 17 years I too will be a multi- millionaire. i figure that gives me till i'm 35. shit. Better get started on that.  talk to you soon sweeties... what a difference a day will make. ciao for now, Jeff

      I was sorting through a box and found a bunch of poetry i'd written in my disillusioned and angsty late teens... Not bad stuff actually, but it makes me cringe to think that I was ever so depressed.  Maybe I'll start posting stuff like that on here. Maybe.  There are so many things going on in my life right now that I am not at liberty to discuss for fear of retaliation from sources that shall remain nameless. Big Brother is always watching me, it seems,  and doing his best to fuck me over.  I still have not been able to cash my paycheque from over a week ago. fuckers.  Are you reading this... ha. i don't care if you are or aren't... :) (you not being "you", gentle reader, hehehe)  Anyway, time will tell.  ...and in Time, so will I.  sweet dreams. jeff

      I think i have something interesting to say and then i open up a new entry, and my mind goes blank.   At work last night, i was sitting there with Hunter and this *guy* comes in, I won't say who, in case i accidentally "out" him, but in any case he's a small time actor who was Really Hot in the mid-nineties and is probably most recognized for a Music Video he was in. In any case, he was the guy who girls drooled over, and, of course, Hunter and I both drooled over when we were that age as well. He was still pretty hot, the same unmistakable face, of course no one else in the bar recognized him because, really, he's not a celebrity.  But Hunter and i did. Then, a few minutes later, I was doing my thing on stage less than 10 feet away from him; a guy i'd had plenty of dirty, DIRTY thoughts about... back in the day.    One of my more surreal moments like that was seeing Valerie Bertinelli and Mackenzie Phillips on the street in Vancouver.  From the looks of it they had run into each other on the street and both were in town filmming something bad, i'm sure.  Seeing the two of them together, the first thought that crossed my mind was "Didn't they used to babysit me when i was a kid?" (in a way, they did)   Celebrity is a funny thing. being "Famous"... being known... what is that? why are some people famous? Darva Conger, John Wayne Bobbit, Richard Hatch... Mary Hart is famous for talking about famous people. Why do so many people seek out fame? would you rather be famous than rich? I'd like my name to hold some weight... not necessarily fame, but importance. So that I could get any reservation i wanted, so I could get behind the velvet rope, so I could do those things that "mere mortals" watch from the sidelines. To walk on a red carpet. BUT WHY? Everything is so plastic, artificial... part of me wants to just accept it, while the analytical side of me just want to write a book and live in New York and observe it all from a distance.  Do I want Champagne and Mirror Balls? I think the most important question is... "Is that really such a bad thing??"  No one scoffs when someone says "I just want to live in a cottage in the woods" (ok i lie, I SCOFF... hippie freak.) but saying something like "I want to surround myself with beautiful and interesting people, in beautiful and interesting places" sounds shallow.   New York, London, LA, Paris. I think there are now only 4 places in the world that I could happily live. and even then, i don't think i could live in LA.  I'm gonna be in LA June 27-30. :)

      So the last week or so has been a bit of a blur, Hunter was in San Francisco for 4 days, he got back and then four days later i was off to Pal Springs for 4 days.  All went well, lots of work, really tiring, but its all getting us closer and closer to our final goal of having enough for nyc really soon.    Met a lot of really cool people while I was there, thank GOD for Nick and Kevin, the assistants who made me feel at home and had me laughing till i was in tears.  It was sorta lonely being away from Hunter for that amount of time, in a weird city (Palm Springs is like the Golden Girls gone Gay), the work itself... lots of different things.    The next few weeks will be busy again... working non-stop and saving all my pennies, Pride is coming up so i'll be busy that week, and then we might be in LA at the end of the month for a few days, immediately after that we have to drive Hunter's car to Alabama, maybe make a stop in Atlanta(?) and then up to nyc. its crazy.   Didn't get a chance to see corey this weekend... which made me sad, cuz it was the one part of the trip i was really excited about. funny, considering the circumstances and the *work* involved, that i'd be most excited about hanging out with him, but i was. (fuck the porn stars... literally i guess... hahaha.)  i'll post a few pics i took once i get a chance! -jeff

You don't care about conventions and have no filter from your brain to you mouth.

      On the 6... like j-lo, right? actually i get on the 6 to 86th then transfer to the 4 or 5... why she didn't think to transfer to an express train is beyond me. i guess "on the 6" sounded better than "on the 6 then 4 or 5" ... she's still Jenny from the block.  used to have a little now she has a lot... hey Jenny can you spare a hundred grand or so? we's po'... not just poor... PO'. hunter started a great new job but isn't getting paid for training, i have a few things lined up but haven't started getting paid for them either...&nbsp; its weird, in Toronto i ALWAYS had spare cash lying around, i was never *out* of money, its not a feeling i'm familiar with. I have a cool design job that should help get my brain working again, the possibility of assisting a stylist on another photoshoot, easy work that pays well...  thank god for friendly strangers... there are a few people who&nbsp;gave me &nbsp;a connection here and a job offer there... without them i dunno what my experience in&nbsp;nyc would have been like so far. scary, i imagine.  dunno what else to tell you... i've been watching "Dead Like Me" on Showtime&nbsp;on Demand... this "on demand" thing on digital cable is the coolest thing ever.&nbsp; met a few cool people since we've been here but because we're poor we haven't been out much... open bar is good and so are 2 for 1 drinks... we don't even have enough for the 2for1 anymore... lol.&nbsp; now thats Po'. Oprah taught me the difference between Poor and Po', cuz she's still the ghettoest billionaire i've ever seen.&nbsp; i loove oprah. she's still oprah from the block. don't be fooled by the rocks that she's got (especially the ice cubes dangling from her ears, *ahem*) ... Who does Lenny Kravitz look more like with his straight hair... Oprah, or Vivica A. Fox? hahaha... Phillip Bloch was a commentator on "Awesomely Badder Hair" on VH1... the man is frizzy and balding... puh-lease.  its way too goddamn hot in this computer room. i'm melting. mellllllting. whatta world, whatta world...  :) -jeff  &nbsp;

      Ok, so i'm not in Toronto anymore. *ta da* i've been ALL OVER the country (thats "the america", not "the canada") the past week or so... all over.  we'll be arriving at our final destination the day after tomorrow, riding on a train all day on July 4th, cross country, which should be cool and fitting.   Saw Farenheit 9/11 today... GREAT movie. really really good.  everyone should see it.  LA was really cool, i'll be posting pics soon, the drive was boring and uneventful, Louisville, Kentucky was surprisingly nice, Alabama is ... well, Alabama.  Airports, i've seen too many in the past few weeks... Toronto, Las Vegas, Palm Springs, Denver, Buffalo, Phoenix, LAX, Baltimore... ughhhh. more news to come.  Planes, Trains and Automobiles, The Musical! its been so long (one week) since i've sat at a computer that I really don't know what to do.  I can't think of anyting to say. Today on Roseanne "New Becky" moved into the Trailer Park and Sharon Stone was wearing a pink bathrobe and a bad wig.  xoxo jeff
