      Ah yes,  urlLink the 6, 7 or 9 layer "Dip."  I fell for it and shan't do it again.   But I ran into former state senator George Petak last night.  And when Bud calls George and apologizes for last year's firing of Ulice Payne, and George calls me to tell me he's renewed his season tickets, then I'll reconsider renewing my season tickets. Unfortunately, George told me, Bud hasn't called.  Of course, if the Brewers look like playoff material next year I'll claim status as "long suffering fan" for a front row on the bandwagon.  By the way, the Brewers lost.  At least I didn't drop my chips.

      From the Washington Post's "Reliable Source" As [Sen. Joe Biden (D-Del.)] recounts in the new Rolling Stone:   "I turned to Vice President Cheney, who was there, and I said, 'Mr. Vice President, I wouldn't keep you if it weren't constitutionally required.' I turned back to the president and said, 'Mr. President, Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld are bright guys, really patriotic, but they've been dead wrong on every major piece of advice they've given you. That's why I'd get rid of them, Mr. President . . .' They said nothing. Just sat like big old bullfrogs on a log and looked at me."   If being right were a qualification for public office, Joe Biden should've been removed from office years ago.  As for non-responsiveness, the President could've been afraid that anything he said might appear in a Biden speech later.   Which reminds me, why does this story sound familiar?  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62638-2004Jun22.html

      "One of the reasons he [Kenneth Starr] got away with it is because people like you only ask me the questions. You gave him a complete free ride. Any abuse they wanted to do. They indicted all these little people from Arkansas, what did you care about them, they're not famous, who cares that their life was trampled. Who cares that their children are humiliated. Nobody in your line of work cared a rip about that at the time. Why, because he was helping their story. And that's why people like you always help the far-right, because you like to hurt people, and you like to talk about how bad people are and all their personal failings" -- Bill Clinton losing his cool in a BBC interview to be broadcast Tuesday night (available on the Web at http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/default.stm). (From Opinionjournal.com Polical diary)  The Little People?  So casually tossed aside when unneeded, cannon fodder when the personal situation requires it, and I ask who is really small.

      Hard to believe I live in Waukesha, sophisticated urbanite that I am.  But let's face it. When the worst crime overnight is "A suspicious resident was carrying a stick and yelling at residents in the 800 block of Eales avenue" and he does it at the reasonable hour of 6:34 PM, THAT'S where I want to live.  And as for the guy who was reported to police for carrying garbage bags and mumbling to himself at the county courthouse, I hear you brother, I hear you.  I hate the garbage rules too.  But the aldermen are at another location.  Of course, in many cases they're the same people so spilling your trash at the courthouse might not be a bad idea.

      If you have to ask, odds are you don't have one.  Or you're too shameless to know better.  But let's put it this way, if you can appear on Springer and there's a good chance a fight will break out or some serious bleeping will occur, you have a Jerry Springer reputation.  If you harbour deep sexual urges for your pet rock and you act on them on your front lawn and the neighborhood looks down on you, you have a Jerry Springer reputation 'cuz you lived the Jerry Springer life, you sicko.    And if you're married to a man just for political convenience and he gets more popular 'cuz he bangs a girl young enough to be his daughter and then lies about it in a trial about whether dropping his pants and showing off his penis to a woman who was brought into the room by his state troopers constitutes sexual harassment, you deserve a Jerry Springer reputation.

      Why not?  That is the answer given by Bill Clinton when Monica flashed her thong.  There.  I've given you all you need to know about Bill Clinton.  You won't have to buy his book or any other book about Bill Clinton.  He got the Jerry Springer reputation he deserved, he got the impeachment he deserved, and he didn't get nearly what he deserved from the American people because he gave Monica no more thought than, "Why not?"  I bet she feels good hearing this.

      The first domestic dispute was reported (according to the  Waukesha Freeman )at 11:57PM. Then 12:46 AM and 2:15 AM.  If people would just go to bed at a decent hour there wouldn't be any trouble.

      I'll bet Joe Frazier wouldn't have needed the help of two kids to throw out the opening pitch.    And is a draft dodger really appropriate to trot out in a time of war?  Does anyone at Major League Baseball actually listen to the performers   before   they sing the national anthem? That had to be the worst since the All Star Game two years ago.    Do you think Roger Clemens is blaming Mike Piazza this morning?  Will Mike Piazza say something about Clemens?  Will Clemens fire a fastball at Piazza to "thank" him for being a distraction behind the plate rather than just catching the ball?  Will Piazza claim that if Roger didn't shake him off constantly he might have given up only a couple of runs?  Why didn't Ben Sheets pitch earlier?  Will Ron Belliard end up being the fattest 2nd baseman anywhere?  He looks me playing 2nd base.  Hey Ronnie, see Reuben Stoddard over there?  That's your future, and I bet you can't sing.
