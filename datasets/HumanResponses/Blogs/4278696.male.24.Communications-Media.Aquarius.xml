      This is my first day wiring on this blog, kinda new to these stuff. haha. Okies...let the journey begins. - Acherly, wat can i sae...nuthin much today. My mind is kinda blank. So lemme re-intro myself. - Chinese: Hokkien mixed with Hainanese Religion: Catholic Am an Aquarius. No longer smokin, drink occasionally, Strictly no gamble.  My behaviour - Sometimes unable to keep my temper. will blow up occassionally. Ironically...would like to learn self control. Am Tryin to be a better person each day. So sometimes i think it's childish not to keep our cool. It's how we show our weakness to our peer. - Loud when with close frens. Quiet if u know me first day. - Some of my frens says i always blur. Acherly i am thinking. I am a thinker. Likes to think a lort of logic n ways to overcome it. - Still seeking enlighment. - At times i would like to live in solace, alone just me n myself to give up everything i have and nuthin in my mind but just peace something like that. Till now...still unable to do so...i guess whoever can obtain this isn't a human afterall. - Love my Dad, Mum n my Sis. They are the only person closest to me. - Sports i've taken: 1. Table tennis Sec 1 till Sec 3 . Joined interschool competition - always lost. never won any price in these area Ps: my dad even sent me to the best Table tennis coach available in the city to coach me. Private training eh. But i still can't make it thru final.  2 . Skateboarding since Secondary 2 year 1994. . 1996 Borneo StreetSkating Championship - 4th Runner Up . 1997 Inter Division Sarawak Street championship - 11th Position - i guess there's too many pro's out there. . currently still skate at times but not that frequent anymore, i guess am too old to go on in this sport. . Got caught twice 2 years ago at Central Business District and Somerset outside california fitness for skating illegally. Lucky just got warning n got my deck confiscated.  3. 1998 - Joined battle of the band in college competition. as a bassist....lost to girl band ler playin aerosmiths songs while we're playin radiohead and china blues  4. Illegal Bike racing . 1996 - 1998 accident thrice lucky not much mishaps but my bike almost a goner . 1997 got caught once and lock up for one day. Till to date my parent didn't even know abt this incident but i think my mum knows abt it just that she didn't say it out coz it's over for so long...haha  5 . 2003 Started Wakeboarding . Began my interest since...till now.  Regrets: - . Rejected some girls in the past...now when i look back, darn why am i so stupid last time. . Never follow my Dad, he was national Swimming coach but i choose to give up on swimming. (This is the worst), now he's no longer ard, i missed him a lort. - Other interest:- . Computers Hardware &amp; software... games etc etc...
