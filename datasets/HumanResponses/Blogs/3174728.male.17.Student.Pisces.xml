       ok so..... how is everyone today? today was kinda borring i did get to talk to my special person though so that made it much better for me today. for anyone who doesnt already know my special person is Allison. we are back togeather and things are going well. other than getting to talk to her i got to go out with my mom pick up and drop off stuff off at the library then we went to iggle video (the giant eagle video rental place). i was originaly going to get detroit rock city but i have already seen it and if i really want it i can probably get it from jake. so..... i got the butterfly effect instead. before i watched it i thought it was going to be either really lame of actualy be a pretty good movie. it ended up being a pretty sweet movie. it was a pretty crazy movie and i enjoyed it. after i rented my movie my mom took me over to tropical trends (some nature store place i dunno what you would call it) by sunsports and the dollar theater. there i picked up some insence if thats how you spell it. i got some vanilla, cinimon, and coconut. the vanilla smells pretty good ive burnt two of those the other two probably smell good too but we will just have to see now wont we. well i think thats about it for this post. oh yea and im upset the took my internet pool game off ebaums world so now i cant play it, BITCHES. yea so thats about all for today.

       so y'all today was a pretty good day i have to say. i woke up at about 2:10 with a phone call. i enjoyd being woken up because the person calling me is a very special person. i hung around my house and ian steedman came by and we played some james bond it was pretty tight. then he left and that special person came over and we watched DALICIOUS and just hung out for a bit. after that special person left i ate some watermelon and let me tell you it was delicious.after i ate my watermelon ian steedman came back and picked me up to go to the SG show. it was a fun show. then he brought me back home and i slamed on some grilled cheese. i made a very delicious grilled cheese sandwich. and thats what happend with me today.
