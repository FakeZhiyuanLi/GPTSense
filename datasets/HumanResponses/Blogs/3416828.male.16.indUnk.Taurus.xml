      Wo0p... Finally I am able to update this beetch. Wow... A lot has happened since the last time I posted... Where to start? Well Kat has broken up with me to 'find' herself again... WTF DOES THAT MEAN! Shes 19 fucking years old and she doesn't know who she is? Well fuck her, im over her, and I think my feelings were slowly going away, and then she did that, I wasn't even hurt, just pissed... And you know what, IM NOT HURTING AM I!? They say nice guys finish last, well maybe thats me, but I can say shes probably the one hurting, because she cried that she might have been making a mistake but she had to do it... Well maybe shes right, she made a mistake, but I can say that if she 'finds' herself, whether its in a day, a week, a month, even a year, she can go 'find' somebody else to bitch at 24/7, because im sick and fucking tired of hearing that shit.... ALL THE FUCKING TIME! My god, I should have listened to everybody... family, friends, pets... You know the deal, but I didn't, and maybe the last 5 months were a waste, I mean the beggining was ok, but after that it was down hill... Anyway, I went to prom with Chrissy :-D. Shes great, always smiling, and can always bring a smile to you. We went and had a great fucking time. We went to a little party afterwards, had some fun hanging with friends, nothing big. Anyway, Im putting the pic of me and chrissy up for my picture for now, so enjoy... BUT NO BEATING OFF!!! Lol...

      This is my first blog. I saw Joe had one so I thought I'd make one and see if I can keep up with updating it. Today wasn't that interesting. I talked to kat a little, then she went out with Sara, shes suppose to call later. For a while now I've been reading a book she gave me, The Last Vampire by Chrisopher Pike. I just found out now that hes a good writer. I like his style of writing, and his version of a vampire. Its not your typicle vampire, I definetly recomend it. The book Im reading has 3 of the stories in it, but all together there are 6. Anyway, im going to listen to some music, maybe read a little more until she calls, I'll probably post tomorrow after work or something.  Peace !

      Well its official, me and Chrissy are going out :-D. I'm really happy about that because shes so great. She doesn't seem to ever be bitchy, shes just high spirited and really fun to be around. She can really make me smile, and she doesn't even need to do anything... It's great. Anyway, I figured I'd let anybody who reads this know that if they didn't already. I gotta go, but I'll probably add another entry tomorrow.

      Hmmmmmm, how long has it been since I posted? Well a lot has gone by. I broke up with Chrissy, but after I got my head straight I asked her back out and she accepted it :-D. Im sorry I hurt you!!!!!!!!! I wont do it again, I love you soo much. I'll have to have another camp out in my backyard, that was crazy. Hmm... I recomend getting Winamp, because theres a station on their radio thing called Chronix Aggression Radio \m/. Its all new and old rock and metal, its great. Anyway, I'll try and remember to update this more often............................. Peaceizzle!
