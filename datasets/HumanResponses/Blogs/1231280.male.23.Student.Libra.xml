      Yo. Well, today wasn't much. I slept until 11:30, went to class, took my bowling mid-term...nothing much. Studyin' tonight and gonna get a little crazy on Saturday. I've been rockin to this group called The Soundtrack of Our Lives all day. They are pretty fuckin good. They are sweedish and they sound like good 70's rock. If you're bored, download their song called "Sister Surround". You'll dig it. I guess Pfeiffer won $500 at the boats the other night. What an ass. I wish I could do that. That money would sure help. Maybe pay off my credit card bill. That'd be sweet. Anyways, about to chill before I go to my spanish class. Out.  -Sieckman

      Yo. Since my life changes every 6 seconds, I decided to create this little journal thingy so you all can keep up with me. Ah, well, lets see here stayed up all night last night studying for Econ. Econ sucks fat donkey dick! Hopefully, I'll pull a C out of my ass on that one. I went to all my classes today despite not having a wink of sleep....I was impressed with myself. Talked to the new woman, and I guess we're gonna "hang out" on Saturday. That'll be good. Anwyas I'm tired. Out.   -Sieckman

      well, goddamn. The last 36 hours have been complete crap. Friday evening, Burlbaw thought it would be fucking cool to steal my car at the gas station while I was buying smokes. Zeke was completely wasted at the time and doesn't remember a thing. He then proceded to ram my car into a cement wall and fuck up the radiator and well as some other shit.Zeke then left my car somewhere and walked back to his fraternity. I called the police and filed criminal charges against him. Got the car towed today, and I'm gonna be without a car for 10 to 14 days. (Thanks alot, asshole). This just goes to show that absolutley all of us drink way too fucking much and only about 15% of us can actually control ourselves when we drink. If you think I'm wrong about this, you're fooling yourself, your family, your friends, and need medical help. Other than than all of this shit that I have to put up with now, I just sat around today, drank beer and watched college b-ball. Tomorrow I work and then come home to snow and no car. What a bunch of fucking crap!

      Well, just enjoying my life without a car today. I got to take the bus to campus this morning, and boy,  have I forgotten how much that completely and utterly sucks balls. (Again, thanks alot Burlbaw - you fucking asshole). So, here I am waiting for my 2:30 class chillin in the 'brary. About to read one of my Sociology books for an hour, head t the union, grab some grub, and head to class, THEN take the bus back home. The weekend was pretty crappy overall and we got about 4 inches of snow yesterday to boot, not to mention it's freakin' cold here!  Bonomo said some bullshit about how he's going to send out some e-mail....well, I haven't gotten it yet so either write it quick, or be called a LIAR. (Dude, I'm bored as hell right now so bite me!)  Well, that's it for now....off to read....and continue to swear at Burlbaw underneath my breath for the remainder of the week.

      Well, it seems that Zeke never fucking learns. He steals my car, fucks up my car and then sits there and calls me a douchebag for calling the cops. What the fuck was I supposted to do? The guy doesn't even remeber fucking up my car. SO, I told him I wasn't even going to consider dropping the charges until I get my car back, fixed and in my possession. For covering my own ass like that I get called a "bastard" and a "douchebag" by his friend, who happened to be in the car with him when he pulled this shit. Doesn't make sense to me. It's now all MY fault. Bullshit. If you want to sit there and call me a douchebag and a bastard, you can fucking kiss my ass. Zeke doesn't realize that this whole situation could have been avoided by him NOT FUCKING drinking. Sneaking Malt Liqour into a movie, getting so wasted that you don't even remember the last half of  it, then stealing your friends car and fucking it up. Throughout this whole process I've been thinking "Who does that kinda shit?" I know who does, and he's not a good friend nor a good person.

      What's up everyone? Nothin been goin on I guess. Well, nevermind. ALOT has been goin' on. I got a 75 on my Econ test which fucking shocked me! I thought I completely bombed that thing. We actually got some spring break plans now too. Peiifer, myself and our neighbors (Cort and Brooks) are headin' up to Milwaukee the Friday right before SpringBreak. We're gonna stay at my aun'ts place and drink lots. I went to this site www.onmilwaukee.com and they have all these bar guides for Milwaukee. On Water St. there are 12 bars all within walking distance. It's gonna be really fun. Burlbaw came over tonight and we talked about shit, especially my automobile. Shit is cool, and we're gonna work it out - and I guess Toms hates me for some reason and is calling me a douchebag behind my back - fuck him. Well, gonna try to do some homework quickly and hit the sack.   -Sieckman

      Well, been awhile since I updated you fools on what's goin on. Life  well...is going. Got our tickets to the Bucks vs. Lakers game on Monday. That's gonna be awesome...seein' the fuckin' Lakers while on Spring Break. Milwaukee is only a short 9 days away. I can't wait, we're gonna have a blast. Past the 10 hour drive, it's going to be nothin' but beer, basketball and seeing lots of new bars - it'll feel so good to get the fuck out of Kansas! Then, the best time of the year begins...MARCH MADNESS! It'll be crazy for I hear we could have a few keg parties scheduled for that weekend (i.e. buying a keg and drinking off it all weekend during basketball). To leave you this grand evening I leave you with a quote form my man George Bernard Shaw: " It is dangerous to be sincere unless you are also stupid". And as my homie Jim Rome would say, "See you tomorrow, we are out."

      Yo. Still workin on the ole paper, coming together quite nicely now. The UW-Milwaukee Panthers are going dancing baby, after 107 years without a single bid. They got it tonight by beating Butler in the Horizon final. Finally, my Dad can be proud of the school he graduated form. So fuckin' awesome. Spring Break and another trip to Milwaukee is only a short 3 days away, but this time it's all about partying hard. Mid Term on Thursday, turn in this paper, and we're off to watch the Lakers vs. the Bucks, and drink plenty of Miller products. It'll be one crazy time. That's pretty much it for now.....back to writing.....

      Well, it's been about a week since I did anything to this thing so let me just give ya a rundown. We Left Milwaukee last Tuesday, hit Chi-Town for the rest of that day. Got home and bought kegs for the entire week and just got buttfaced and watched basketball. We all exploited the slut girl next door...what a dirty, dirty slut. Man, have I met a few of those in my day or what? Good news of the day is that I recieved a 95% on my 12 page paper on punk rock. That kicks ass. Bad news of the day is that I have to clean my room/apartment. Oh well. Off to ebd so I can get up and clean some more.  -Sieckman

Clean this place, take a shower,and chill. The weekend was very uneventful as I did nothing Friday night, hooked up Ken and Sheryl's surround sound/HDTV all day Saturday and worked all day Sunday. Fun times! Well, back to the TV until later.....if you're lucky I might update before I hit bed.

      Ah, new day....new dollar. Long day yesterday and possibly (if things go my way) longer day today. Still working hard on the journalism project. Thought hard yesterday about my life and the things i need to fix within it. One of them is Jessica. I need to get her back. However, this is easier said than done. I spent 200 dollars on her (diamonds- I might add) for Christmas! I don't do that for anyone, and yet, her and I just threw it all away like fucking 2 year olds. We are both going through some shit right now, and I'm sure each of us could use each others company during these tough times. Shit, I know I sure could. Who knows? She's a very strong minded person and probably has moved on. I was so passive when I was around her. I wasn't as strong headed or stubborn as I am normally. Oh well. I fucked it up, like I have done with so many other things in my life. It is... my life. It is... my curse.  -B

      Good day today. Not great, but good. First, the good things: As I waiting for the bus this morning, Candice (the girl who I have wanted for a while now) stops, rolls down her window and asks if I want a ride. What do you think I did? We get to class and I guess she was bragging to 'Los that she gave me a ride....could this be a sign of things to come? Stay Tuned. Anyways, got some more work done on my project and Ted Fred said that I'm on the right track...which is good. So, during class, I ask Candice if she wants to grab a beverage after class....she agrees. We go, chill out for a little bit and I get a ride home in the process. Turns out I can see her apartment form my bedroom window. NICE! She goes to work and I chill on the ole couch for awhile. Now here I am completely procrastinating on my paper that I need to write. So, pretty good day overall. Totally funny scandalous things are going on with the hoobaskank next door that I won't post here for obvious reasons. If you know my number and want to know...gimmie a call - I'll tell ya! Anyways, out for now.  -B

I'm not trying to set myself up for disaster  though, either. I'm gonna take this thing slow. If it's meant to be, it's meant to be. If not - it's not. we'll see how the next few weeks turn out. Just take it one day at a time. She's the only thing in my life right now that is good. Everything else is shit. Maybe she came into my life for a reason. We'll find out. Anyways, peace out - we'll talk to ya all tomorrow.

      Here is my column from www.sportsphds.com this morning.    After a long and stressful last day of classes yesterday, Squeak was spent. After getting about 3 hours of sleep the past three days, I headed home for a restful night of sleep. First off, today is "Stop Day." There are no classes today to give students time to study for finals next week (yeah, right). Any smart person would suddenly realize that everyone goes out and gets plastered the night before and spends a hungover day at home. Not wanting to fight the crowds and save some money, Squeak goes to bed early, about 10:30. Two hours later, the calls begin.   Call #1: 12:39 AM CST. Caller: Mike Bonomo  The phone rings and Squeak sees that it is one of his buddies who lives in Kansas City. He picks it up and is greeted by a loud crowd in the background. "Dude, next time to come up we gotta go to this place, you'll love it," Bonomo says.  "Why?" Squeak asks. "It's a piece-of-shit hole in the wall and I just got a shot of tequila for 75 cents," Bonomo yells back.   WTF? You called me at 1:00 in the morning to tell me about this shit? Squeak hangs up and goes back to sleep.  Call #2: 12:59 AM CST. Caller: "Mrs. B-KU in training"  The phone rings and Squeak immediatley knows it is "Mrs. B-KU-IT", due to the ringtone.  He picks it up and answers it.   "Hey, whatcha doin,?" Mrs. B-KU-IT asks. "Uh, sleeping," Squeak replies.  "Well, I am so f*cking drunk right now. I had 5 Bahama Mamas and a shot. I am so drunk. This is the real _________ (Mrs. B-KU-IT says her name)," she says.   WTF? Suddenly, Squeak sits up in bed. "What do you mean by the REAL _________?" Squeak asks.  "Well, I figure you've never really seen me this wasted before," she says.  "So, what you're trying to say is that you're an alcoholic?" squeak asks.  "No, well, it's just I like to party and alot of people think I'm a goody two shoes," she says.  Squeak realizes that Mrs. B-KU-IT is trying to impress Squeak. Squeak realizes that Mrs. B-KU-IT is not drunk, she is annihilated. Mrs. B-KU-IT hands off the phone to her drunk roomate. Squeak converses with the drunk roomte for a matter of two seconds. After some small talk, Squeak terminates the call and goes back to sleep.   Call #3: 1:59 AM CST. Caller: Carlos Mashek.   Carlos is one of Squeak's J-school buddies. Squeak answers the phone.  "Hey, **** face! I thought you were going to come out and get wasted tonight. YTou're a ******* faggot!," Carlos yells.  Squeak immediatley terminates the call and throws his cell phone against the wall and goes back to sleep. Stupid college kids.

      "Yeah, here comes the water. It comes to wash away the sin of you and I." -Velvet Revolver, "Slither".  I had this up here about a week ago, but it finally has come true. The water is that of a form. That form is a change of major form. It feels so good to get the FUCK out of the J-school. I'm leaving on my terms - clean and crisp. The pressure is off and I'm really not concerned about getting a degree in journalism anymore. Personally, I don't give a fuck anymore - I just want out. Anyone selling tickets?

      Hello people! Hope you like the new look! This place is going to get crazier here in the future. Audio posts, pictures, links, etc. This blog is going totally multimedia. I'm excited and you should be too - you're the one who's reading it! On to more important things...  Sorry, it has been awhile since I updated this thing. I apologize. I've been busy. Went to the Royals game last night (picture below) and had a very good time w/ Bonomo, Pfeiffer, Brooks and Palmer. It was good times had by all, and the Royals won.  I did find out the past couple of days (especially now since I spend most of my days inside my apartment) that Jim Lee is doing Superman now. Who's Jim Lee? Jim Lee used to draw X-Men back in the early 1990's then did a little book called W.I.L.D.Cats for Image back when Image had just started. He did Fantastic Four as well in 1996 to surge the sales of the book (yours truly owns all the copies of that work - it was awesome stuff.) Anyways, he's doing Superman now and it looks absolutley gorgeous. Take a look at some scans below I found, I think you will agree. I will be going downtown and snagging myself a copy tomorrow. I hope this sort of "multimedia" post today will please all of you "Sieckman-lovers."    Peace out, we'll talk to ya' all soon!    A page in the book- Superman #204, penciled by Jim Lee. (DC Comics, $2.50)     Thanks to "Severn" of BD Forums for the scan

Always the best stuff comes out during the summer anyways, so why the fuck not? Anyways, checked the grades, they were allright. Could have been better, but I had a hell of a semester so it kinda showed. At least I'm not getting kicked out! Tired as all hell and finally gonna try on working to get the sleeping pattern back to normal. Hope you all had a wonderful day, and we'll talk to you all real soon.

      Just want to clue you guys in on one of the best DVD's ever created. This is it. We lived by this stuff during highschool man - it made studying for that chem test bareable. WCW vs. WWF - every Monday night could not be beat! Pick it up if you want to...it's a freaking 1 hour and 45 minute documentary!!! I've had it for a couple of months now and I've probably watched it at least 15 times. Worth a rent, definetley worth a buy.

       urlLink The Comic Book Periodic Table of the Elements   Just a fantastic site that 2 professors from the University of Kentucky did. They digged and digged and found where every element of the periodic table has been mentioned or shown in a comic book. Pretty amazing if you ask me!

      Hello everyone. Well, the knee pain that I had been experiencing was an MCL sprain. Fun times! So, now I'm laying on the couch icing it and waiting until I take some more pain-killers the doc hooked me up with. Fun! Fun! Court was as good as court could be, got my shit and left within 10 minutes. Have a good weekend.

      Good day, kids. Get ready for a fun, fun, fun day today. First, changed the look, I like this one alot better - hope you do as well. Lots of funny stories, links and pictures today. I promise you will leave satisfied. As for my day today, it was OK. First, I had to do something about the Sociology class I was trying to get into. I had FINALLY (after a week) heard back from one professor I wanted to take it from and he couldn't do it. (FYI: This class I'm tyring to get in is an independent study sociolgy research class.) So, I hopped on campus today to try to find a faculty member who would do it with me. I couldn't find anyone. Well, that's beacuse the department was barren. So, I took the initiative to e-mail the head of the department to see if he knew of anyone willing to teach it over the summer, or shit, if he wanted to do it for me.   This is what I e-mailed to him. My editorial notes will be placed in these "[]". Names have been changed.   Professor Tillson-   My name is Brandon Sieckman and I am a senior who just recently changed my major to Sociology. I had sociology minor with my former major, and I am looking to graduate in Spring of 05.    The past few weeks I have been searching for a faculty member to help with complete a SOC 698 over the summer. I contacted Professor Gonny [ the one who took a week to get back to me ] and unfortunatley, he was busy. I am now looking for another faculty member who would be willing to help me complete this. I contacted you because I thought maybe you would know of anyone who was doing this with other students this summer, or perhaps, you would be interested as well. If you know of anyone who I could get in contact with, I would be grateful - completeing this over the summer would help my semester loads next year be a smidge lighter. Thank you so much for your time, and I look forward to hearing form you.   Regards, Brandon Sieckman sieckman@ku.edu       Well, after I wrote this, I found out from my advisor that I didn't need that class because: A) It wouldn't count towards my degree and B) I didn't need as many 300-plus level classes as I thought I did.   This is the { Sarcasm Alert }  ABSOLUTLEY LOVELY  { End Sarcasm Alert } e-mail I recieved back from him.   Well Brandon, this is why these things should be arranged ahead of time.  Faculty are listed in the time-table as available for SOC698 in the summer to permit them to carry these credits only if they have agreed to do so. They are not actually paid over the summer.   SOC698 is reserved for students who have worked closely with a professor and are engaged in:  "Library or field research either as part of an ongoing project or as an independent study project.  Prerequisite: Two courses in sociology and consent of instructor."  Like most faculty, I generally do not complete a SOC698 unless I have had a student in class and they have performed in such a way as to merit consideration.  I am willing to discuss this with you, however.  I have office hours on TU-TR 1.30-3.00.  Come prepared with a copy of your ARTS form and a proposal for what you plan to do for these SOC698 credits.    WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT FOR?  You totally bitched me out about approaching you about this, and then you said you would help me do it. Do you honestly think that I would want to do it with you after you just said that shit to me? You know what? I have three words for you:   GO FUCK YOURSELF!    OK, now that we have that out the way, we can move on to better things.   For those of you who have been away from the KC Metro scene lately, Standford & Sons in Westport is turning into Johnny Dare's. Yes, the Morning DJ. Check out the story below.   urlLink Wesport Club Takes A Dare - Kansas City Star, 04/16/04   I have heard it is opening soon and that it's gonna be crazy. Good times!  This is for all of you Christina Aguilera lover's out there. For those of you who know me, I think she's a fucking ho. Anyways, check this shit out....     Yes, that is her   WITHOUT MAKE-UP   on the left and   WITH MAKE-UP   on the right. There you go nipple-ring-lover-boy....eat your fucking heart out!  Let's see here....there has gotta be more fun we can have....Oh yeah, another bitch I have before we move on in today's lesson: LEAVE SOME FUCKING COMMENTS, ASSHOLES! There are little "0 Comments" buttons at the end of every post. Click on it and leave me some love. I work semi-hard on this thing to entertain you people, so leave me some love, bitches.  OK...more fun...I thought this was kind of interesting...     MMMMMMM, MMMMMMMMMM, bitch!   Ok...more fun...this is what your girlfriend wants for christmas this year...     (Cheesey comedy drum thingy goes here)  Well, that's all I have for today kids. Before I go, I want to leave you with a quote from the late, great Ronald Reagan.  "Republicans act like every day is the 4th of July. Democrats act like every day is April 15th."  God bless you Ronnie and may you rest in peace.      Have a good one and well talk to you all real soon. Take care of yourselves.  -B

      After a Beer festival, the Brewery Presidents went out together to get a beer. The guy from Corona says "Get me the best beer in the world, a Corona."   The guy from Budweiser says, "Get me the best beer in the world, the king of all beer, a Budweiser."  The guy from Coors says, "Get me the best beer in world, made with mountain spring water from the Rockies, get me a Coors."   The guy from LaBatt Blue says "Get me the best beer in the world, ay, a LaBatt Blue don'cha know."   The guy from Guinness then says, "Get me a Coke."   Taken aback the members from the brewery club asked "Why aren't you getting a Guinness?"  The Guinness president replied, "Well, I figured if you guys aren't drinking beer, neither would I."

      OK, been busy. Hopefully, I'll have good news tomorrow.  "What's Brandon Reading" Episode III   Book   Star Wars: Specter of the Past  By: Timothy Zahn     Story: Specter of the Past is the first of a new series, The Hand of Thrawn. Princess Leia is trying desperately to hold the loose coalition of interests known as the New Republic together long enough to see the evil Empire finally vanquished. But in a stunning setback, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker discover that the pirate ships raiding New Republic transports are staffed with clones under the command of someone who claims to be Grand Admiral Thrawn, the Empire's most powerful warlord, believed dead for 10 years. Thrawn's plan for destroying the fragile New Republic seems well on the way to completion--unless Han, Leia, and Luke can stop it.  Squeak says: Just started this puppy. I loved the first (original) Thrawn Trilogy, so this will probably be just as good.    Comic Book   Identity Crisis #2 , DC Comics     Story: More fun stuff from New York Times bestselling author Brad Metzler. The DC Universe gets shaken to its very core!  Squeak says: I loved #1. It was probably the best comic book of the summer. Although at first, I didn't realy care about who died in the first issue, Metzler made me by the end of the issue. Haven't read this issue yet, but I'm about to sit down and read it.
