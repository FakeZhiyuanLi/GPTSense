      Every morning, I drive 40 minutes to work. This would normally be much more tolerable than it actually is, had my coffee not attacked my CD player early one day, and left me with mere radio as my sole companion. Rhonda the Honda, being the base model that she is, gets about 5 stations, and my commute is filled with a medley of soft rock, hardcore rap, and gospel.  On most mornings, I devise little games to entertain myself. My favorite game is when I pretend I'm in a music video, to whatever song happens to be on KOIT. This morning, that song was "Ain't Nobody", by Chaka Khan. This, being one of my favorite songs EVER, meant my twisted, psychotic pretend video had to rock. Don't worry. It did.  When I'm pretending I'm in a video, I'm not driving my car in the video. I'm in leather pants, I have a posse of scantily clad vixens, I kick men out of my way with my stiletto sling backs.  Oh, and I actually sing out loud. And by sing, I mean I belt it.   So, here I am, driving down Lombard Street, singing at the top of my lungs, hair flips abound, lost in my own vocal stylings and improvised riffs, and pretending I'm driving a Vanquish through the foggy streets of Manhattan.  Approaching a red light poses an interesting dilemma. I can’t just stop. I’m too invested. I’m lost in the music, the strobe lights, the dry ice machine. Red lights can't stop my video. I fall further into the fantasy. “Now, we’re flying through the stars, I hope this night will last forever. Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh…” And with this last key change, I turn towards the camera (driver’s side window) and open my eyes. Stopped next to me is a Land Rover filled with hot Marina yuppie scum, all staring at me. They’re not laughing. This is beyond merely singing along with the radio. This is beyond charmingly quirky. I can see it in their eyes. This is sad.  Suddenly, I was back in San Francisco, is my ghetto little car, feeling like a jackass.  I wish I had thrown a lit cigarette in their precious Rover. I wish I had laughed in their suburban Caucasian faces. I wish I had cranked up the Chaka, crawled on top of the car, and continued my video, before God and everyone.  But I didn’t. I sank in my seat, changed the station to some dreadful Usher song about impregnating people, and prayed for a green light.  The worst thing about this is, my retarded pretend Chaka Khan video is a million times cooler than the 1997 episode of Suddenly Susan they were obviously pretending to be in. And I’m the one that felt like an idiot.  I’m being judged by a 35 year old man with highlights, and I’m the loser.  Please.

      It's my second to last day of work, and Margot and I are alone in the office. Now that Carol, the prop lady, has returned all of the faux folliage and "stylishly" arranged it about the room, KFOG won't come on the radio anymore, due to the large basket of plastic squash placed atop the stereo. Thanks a million, Carol.  Normally, when it's just the kids in the office, Ben plays us a medely of hits on Rhapsody, his online music site. But Ben is gone, and Margot has us listening to some kind of acid jazz involving scat. Thanks a million, Margot. Thus, we're forced to try and hack into Rhapsody, guessing at what Ben's password might be. Ben, complex fellow that he is, isn't making this very easy for us. Damn you, Ben Coe Freak Show. Damn you.  We've tried, "IwantMargot" and "IwantBeth". To our shock, it's neither. Nor is it "clay", "hippies", or "weed." We're at a loss. So Ben, if you're reading this... What the fuck is your password?  And, oh yeah, we miss you.

      The other day, my beloved living companion, Bonnie, called me at work and invited me to the Giants game. Apparently, her company, Gymboree, got a bunch of tickets somehow, and Bonnie grabbed us two. Having no idea who else from Gymbo was going, and quite frankly, not really caring, we threw on jeans and sweatshirts and cabbed it to Pac Bell. Upon arrival, we scoped the scene of thousands of baseball lovers entering the stadium and gave each other a knowing look. There were a lot of cute boys here, and not many cute girls. The odds were looking good.  Now, I’m not a sports lover. I’ll scream and yell and do the wave, but I’m not invested in who wins. I don’t know the player’s names or their stats. And, I really only applaud the good looking ones. But any event which combines libations and a ballpark filled with men is an event I’m likely to attend.  Our seats were practically in the blimp circling the stadium, we were so high up. We hiked to our section, and made our way to the seats. Um, wait a second. There are two really cute guys in the seats right next to us, and they’re already well on their way to drunk. We sit down, and share a second knowing look.  They are Butch and Rocco*, and they are hilarious. Butch is new to Gymbo, and as his lady-friend was unavailable, he brought along Rocco. Rocco is (…wait for it…) a porn distributor. I take a sip from my water bottle filled with Merlot. This is going to be interesting.  By the 5th inning, I’m freezing and tired of pretending to care about the game. Conveniently enough, Butch and Rocco are ready to leave as well, and kindly invite us to join them at a bar. With stifled giggles and many elbow nudges, Bonnie and I agree, and the 4 of us depart the stadium. Rocco has some dive bar in mind, and we follow him blindly for blocks until we reach The Eagle’s Lounge. The Eagles’ Lounge is much like it sounds, a relic of a bygone era. It’s the kind of place 1970’s Michigan union workers hang out in, complete with a juke box, pool table, and lone patron passed out at the bar. Bonnie discovered a cozy nook with a dart board and a few booths, and we set up camp.  Butch and Rocco went off to get drinks, and as the only wine available was airline mini-bottle screw top, I opted for a Vodka and Cranberry.  We then proceeded to play a very intense and competitive game of darts. (“You suck, Marin. You suck!”) Apparently, everyone else had been dart champions in previous lives, because comparatively, I did indeed suck. Who cares? We’re getting drunk with random cute strangers.  Suddenly, a tray of Jaggermeister shots was placed before me. Guns and Roses blared from the juke box. Butch began to dance. I am a bar snob, much preferring the sophisticated ambiance of Le Colonial to the duct taped booths of the Eagle’s Lounge. But I have to admit, this place rocked. Soon after, the popular catchphrase was coined, “What happens in the Lounge, stays in the Lounge.” Hours later, we stumbled onto the sidewalk, clutching our companions yet knowing that we must leave them wanting more. After many hugs, phone number exchanges, and promises to do this again as soon as is humanly possible, they put us in a cab and waved goodbye. As we erupt into giggles, Bonnie looks over and says, “I love unexpected fun.” Well said, my morally ambiguous roommate. Well said.  * names have been changed to protect Bonnie’s co-workers.

      I spent Saturday morning in a hung-over haze, drinking coffee and hoping for a good movie on TBS or similar. I ended up watching The American Film Institute’s Lifetime Achievement Award Tribute to Meryl Streep and it's opened a whole new world for me. Really, is there anything better than a 2 hour televised celebrity studded extravaganza whose sole purpose is public worship and adoration?   No, there isn't.   Thus, I've decided this is how I'd like my next birthday celebrated. I want an AFI Lifetime Achievement Tribute, staring me and my glorious celebrity friends and colleagues, full of video montages and tearful videotaped messages of love from the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Tom Hanks, and (gasp) Bill Murray. Oh, no. I want Bill to host, actually. And, each fabulous year of my life will be detailed and applauded, the audience enthralled by my dance recitals, touched by my personal tragedies, and inspired by my joie de vivre. All the while, I sit, swaddled in plaid taffeta (don't ask) behind a floral encrusted dais chugging Stag's Leap and pretending to be modest.  Oh look. Here comes George Clooney. He winks at me from the stage, shares some personal tidbits about our close and often written about friendship, and then chokes up as he recounts the first time he saw me across a crowded room at The Sundance Film Festival.  Wait. It's the cast of Friends doing a choreographed dance routine to a medley of my favorite songs. And, here we have Bill Clinton, so moved he can barely speak, save for referring to me as a "confidant and close personal advisor." He bows his head and touches his heart. There are no words. Finally, once the endless parade of Beth worship comes to an end, I must make my way past the thousands of admirers (Kevin Spacey, I can't believe you made it!) and onto the stage for my speech. Looking out into the crowd, a sea of adoring faces all turned to me, I begin. I thank my family, my dear friends, all the talented people I've ever worked with. I joke, I reminisce, I wink back at George Clooney. And when it's all finally over, my limo whisks me away to my top secret VIP after party at SkyBar, exclusively photographed by Vanity Fair. I make my entrance just as J-Lo is turned away at the door and I strut directly onto the dance floor, where I immediately begin to bust a move with Justin Timberlake and his back up dancers. I party till the wee hours, pass out amid a mountain of delivered bouquets, and awake poor and alone at 916A, the only clues as to the previous night's events being an empty bottle of Cristal and a mysterious hickey, rumored to be the mark of Clooney.  Bonnie, make it happen.

      Fuck it. I'm going to The Midnight Sun and Badlands tonight. I'm actually going with my high school friend, Rob, who is now apparently gay. I found out about Rob's new homo tendencies on Friendster, to which I am addicted. Everyone is on there, including old high school flame's who are now advertising for man-sex. Thus far, in addition to Rob, I've discovered my 3rd garde boyfriend AND the one night stand I had in Ireland. Neither of them are out yet, but I won't be surprised when they do.

      I've always known I was a fag hag. But lately, as more and more men from my past crawl out of the hetero woodwork and sashay into gaydom, I'm wondering. What is wrong with me? Why do I have such chemistry with queens? Why do straight men confuse and befuddle me, not just romantically but socially? I simply can't figure it out.  Thus, in an effort to expand my circle of penis-possessing pals, I will from this day forward, no longer patronize gay bars. While fabulous, friendly, and well stocked with hot boys, these establishments just serve to perpetuate my never-ending need to discuss Prada's new line and the universal hotness of Gale Harold. This, however, while fun, results in my going home alone, curling up in bed with a bottle of wine, and watching Muriel's Wedding yet again.

      When you're housesitting, there's a whole library of music and books that you want to try out. This evening, while going through their CD collection, I came across Carly Simon's Anticipation album. I haven't heard this album since I was a little kid running around Sea Ranch, and all of a sudden, my childhood is flooding back. This is surprisingly intense. I'm trying to get ready to go out, but quite frankly, I don't want my ride to show up because I need to re-experience this album. Seriously. I'm about to cry. It's a sad day in the life of Beth when I'd rather spend a Saturday night making a fire and listening to Carly Simon instead of hitting the town with my friends. They'd never let me get away with it, but secretly, it's what I really want to do. I know you all think I have shitty taste in music, and fuck you very much by the way. But do yourself a favor and get this album. Fuck. I need a hankie.

      As most of you know, I have a few good straight guy friends who occasionally request that I accompany them on apparel shopping sprees. Today, Darren and I went downtown to purchase him an entirely new wardrobe. The boy needs it. I told him today, he looked like the Unabomber. Darren's a little touchy about his pristine new Acura, and as we're stuck at a light around Union Square, a 3-toothed hobo sticks half his body inside the car and asks for tuna. Tuna? Yep. Tuna. Darren would have shit his pants, were it not for his precious leather seats. We sped off and spent money, but the tuna hobo stays in my mind. Sure, he's nuts. And probably hungry. But what are the odds that we'd have some tuna? Does he ever have success with this? Does he ask for other foods? And what kind of tuna did he want? Are we talking seared Ahi or Star of the Sea? PS. If you see a straight guy walking around like he was just made over by the Fab Five, that'd be Darren. I don't know how many high school math teachers walk around in Emmanuel Ungarro, but my boy looks fierce.

      Not 10 minutes ago, I was walking downstairs to go crawl into the huge purple velvet chaise in the den and read my trashy novel, when I spotted a small object in the doorway of the guest bathroom. It was a fucking dead bird. Keep in mind, this isn't the first dead bird I've encountered while housesitting. Years ago, while at Judy and Jerry's old house in Sea Cliff, I was standing at the sink washing dishes when all of a sudden, a bird flew right into the window directly in front of me and then dropped 2 stories to the garden below. I ran onto the kitchen deck and looked down. The poor creature was twitching and erratically moving. Emma, a rotweiler who understands me like no one else, was going nuts, sniffing and barking at the dying bird. I decided to call my mother, a notorious animal hater, for advice. "Ignore it till it dies, then toss it in the bushes." This from the woman who sent me to 4th grade with chicken pox, telling everyone I had fleas. Carol Brady, she ain't. I couldn't stand to watch this bird in obvious hell, and I certainly couldn't forget about it, especially considering it had committed suicide right before my eyes. Should I call the SPCA? Should I put it out of it's misery? I had no idea. I looked back out into the garden and Emma was now playing with the bird. I couldn't tell if it was still alive. "Emma, drop the bird. Drop it, honey." Emma drops her plaything and runs upstairs and inside. I tip toe down to the garden to inspect the morbid scene. The bird, finally dead, was a mess of blood and feathers. In an act of what some might call bravery, and others, cruelty, I took a paper towel, and tossed the corpse into the neighbor's yard. Today, I found myself in a sadly similar situation. Hey, it worked the first time around. The dead bird, that'd be dead bird #2, is now resting in peace next door, in a bed of hydrangeas. You'd think I'd feel some sadness for the dead creature or some guilt for throwing dead animals into stranger's perfectly manicured gardens. Nope. All I feel is a sense of deja vu and an aversion towards poultry.

      Nicolas Cage just married a 20 year old sushi waitress. Ewwww.  Why is everyone on Michael Jackson's case? At least he's talented. I know some of my friends adore Nicolas Cage, so I'll only say this: whining and acting are two different things. Cage is a fucking whiner. Oscar or not, the man's only good movie is Guarding Tess. Fuck, that's some good shit.

      Tonight, I had the loveliest little dinner party. Bonnie, Zoe, Kate, Kelsey, and Alex came over to my big housesitting house, and we cooked a huge amazing meal, and drank bottles of wine. We talked about the elections and our careers and who we like and who we hate. We laughed and joked and debated. And then, we drunkenly made a million cookies and all crammed in the hot tub. Exhausted, everyone all piled out and went home together, at a reasonable hour, and I'm about to crawl into a huge cozy bed and watch my crime crap on TV and call Andy. I couldn't be happier. I really couldn't. I know I complain, but sometimes, I love my life.

      Yesterday, I was on the phone for awhile with my good friend, Kelsey. We came to the conclusion that really, all of our lives would be a lot easier without any men around. Thus, we propose this: Move all men to Australia. Based on birthday, each woman gets a yearly trip Down Under. (For example, I’d be on the January 28th flight.) Muriel’s Wedding is always the in-flight movie. All the men line up, and you get to pick one to bring back. Whenever you’re done with him, send him back at any time, or simply keep him until your next birthday. Then, trade up. What? It sounds a lot like slavery? Well, what do you think they’ve been doing to us for the last 2000 years?  This way, they’re almost like pets. And hopefully, they’ll all develop those charming accents. It’s win-win. Men should be delighted to be used only for sex and eye candy. We don’t want your money. We’re not even particularly interested in your thoughts. And we certainly don’t need your mind-game bullshit. It all comes down to the nookie.  Now, if you find a good one, ladies, you may approach the Estrogen Alliance (made up of 12 brilliant women) and apply for a man permit. A man permit allows you a 5 year window to see if he’s worth the trouble. Because, as we all know, they can rock for a few months, but when the honeymoon is over, suddenly you’re opening your own goddamn door. If, at any time during the 5 years, you realize that this man is just like every other asshole, you may return him. You will also have the option of tattooing a note on his body somewhere, so that other women on other flights will know he’s a jerk.  If, by some freak chance, you and he spend 5 years in bliss, then you may apply for Permanent Man Status (PMS), which would be quite rare. This gets a little more complicated, as now females have to collectively agree that this man is worthy of living permanently amongst women. There is a world-wide vote (obviously, Australia is excluded) and the results are televised. Keep in mind, with PMS, you give up your seat on all flights Down Under. Obviously, some details need to be worked out. With no women in Australia, who dresses them? I mean, they need to look cute when we come for selection. Also, what about the gays? I propose they should be allowed to live amongst the women. They’ve been nothing but good to us throughout history, and have been screwed by the straights as well.  Now, I know some good men, and I'm sure you do too. Prior to shipping them all off, you may make a case for your guy friends or current boyfriend. However, keep in mind that their history as it pertains to women will be debated hotly.  Regardless, Kelsey and I are ready to put this plan into action immediately. We’re currently in talks with prominent Australian women. We seek your support and look forward to a land in which women can live truly free.

      I fucking love The Barenaked Ladies. They rule. They rock. Ed is a god. But, I also know it’s kinda nerdy to live BNL, and the biggest clue to that is the fact that there were six (6) black people at the concert last night. We counted. That can’t be a good sign. So, I’m on a mission to bring BNL (and other Canadian 90’s alt-rock) into the “community.”  I’ll gather up all kinds of Sarah McLachlan and Alanis Morissette and pass it out at DL Hugley concerts or similar. Then, we’ll all wear plaid and sing about high school. It’ll be awesome. Join me.

      There’s a book by Erma Bombeck entitled, “When you look like your Passport Photo, it’s time to go home.” As most of you know, I’m going to China in two weeks, and thus, need to get a Visa. An international travel Visa requires an additional passport-esque photo. Thus, I drove myself down to the photo place and plopped my ten bucks on the counter. Now, I’m in sweats and a denim jacket, but truth be told, I caught a glimpse of myself on the way out, and I look pretty cute today. &nbsp;So, how can it be that I’ve just taken the worst picture I’ve ever seen in my life? I actually look like I have Downs Syndrome. Literally. It’s ridiculous. Even the guy that took it was like, “Whoa.”  Quelle horreur.

      Sometimes, you need to get burned to know who really loves you. Man, you guys. This week, I found out. Bon and I are ready to hire a hitman. Regardless, I just want to say, I cannot believe how awesome my friends are. I don’t deserve you guys. I moan and bitch and call you at all hours to talk about my stupid problems, and you are always there for me. All of you. So, in no particular order: Bonnie, Dani, Zoe, Andy, Mercedes, Darren, Jason, Jesse, Christine, Kate, Katherine, Tammy, Pip, Carrie, Cindy, Molly, Paul, Kelsey, Margot, Ben, Judy, Irene, Jenny, Matt, Bosco, Ryan, John Boy, and Alex. I fucking love you guys. I can’t believe you put up with me. I promise, I’ll make it worth your while one day. Seriously. Who has 28 best friends? God, I love you people so much, I can barely stand it. I may never win that Oscar, so here’s your public thank you.   Plus, you guys are the only ones that actually read this. That’s why I really love you.

      Last night, I was walking Marilyn, the gorgeous golden retriever that I’m dogsitting. As you know, we’re up in the hills of Mill Valley, and I like to walk her along the windy roads and trails in the neighborhood. Along we walk, minding our own business, when suddenly, Marilyn reacts to a rustling in the bushes. Now, Marilyn reacting to anything is pretty exciting, so I immediately look over, and there, standing 10 feet away and staring directly at us, is a huge deer with monstrous antlers. This thing was a beast. I was probably eye to eye with it, and it’s antlers added another 2 or 3 feet.  Marilyn didn’t move. I didn’t move. The deer didn’t move. We all stood, staring at one another. I tried to remember what you’re supposed to do in these situations. With a bear, you’re supposed to make yourself bigger. Or, are you supposed to stay still? I can’t remember. But, this was a deer anyway. The only deer rule I know is that if you’re driving and you’re about to hit a deer, don’t swerve. Hit it. But, what do you do if you’re walking? I stood there, silently reviewing all information I had regarding wild beast emergencies. Turns out, very little.  The deer took a step closer.  “Get lost!” I scream. “Scram!”  Yeah. I said scram. The only other time I’ve ever even heard someone say “Scram” was Carla on Cheers, telling her hockey playing boyfriend to skedaddle. Who knew I had a scram in me? Regardless, my screaming did nothing. We’re now 9 feet away from each other, still staring. I decide that we can’t just stand here all day. I mean, I want to go see The Notebook. I’ve got my tissues all ready. I’ve got to shake a leg. So, I decide that we’ll casually continue our walk. Fuck it. If the deer, reacts, so be it.  Marilyn and I take not 2 steps, when the deer runs out of the bushes and onto the road, now about 4 feet from us. I could practically touch him, he was so close. (I might be an idiot, but I do know that only boy deer have antlers. Pretty good, huh.) My stunned silence turned uncontrollably into a scream.  “Oh my god, get the fuck out of here! Go!” And, with that last scream, I king of threw the leash (still attached to Marilyn, mind you) at the deer. That was all he needed. He turned off running down the hill, knocking down trees and causing general mayhem.  “Wow. Marilyn. That was exciting, huh?” She looks at me with disgust. I could see it in her eyes.  “I was still attached to the leash, bitch. What the fuck? Were you sacrificing me?” “Marilyn, no, no, no. I would never. It was the only thing I could throw. Don’t worry. I’ll totally protect you.”  But we all know that’s bullshit. Take the dog. Have your way with her. Just let me go.

      I have notoriously bad taste in music. I mean, I loved New Kids on the Block until well into 1993. But, I have to say, I think I’m on to something big. They’re called Scissor Sisters, and they rock. Go to MTV.com, and check out their video for “Take Your Mama.” This is the greatest thing I’ve ever heard in my life.   I wanna get jacked up on some cheap champagne….

      My brother Alex, whom I love and adore, is a little piece of shit. As we all know, if anything ever happened to my baby brother, I’d kill myself on the spot. I worry about that boy like nothing else. I cannot imagine what would happen, were I without my Lexi.  20 minutes ago, my father calls me in hysterics.  “Alex’s boss called. Alex has apparently been in a car accident and is on his way to the hospital. I’m driving to Marin General now!”  “What!” I’m screaming. &nbsp;I’m running all over the house, grabbing phones and throwing shoes on. “I’m calling Alex’s work.”  I call Paradise Café, where Frank answers.  “Well, golly, Beth. I got a message from someone claiming to be Alex’s father, saying Alex was on his way to the hospital. So I call up Dick, and he has no idea what I’m talking about. I guess it was a crank call.”  “Okay, Frank.” I say. “I’ll keep you posted.”  I call Alex. He doesn’t answer, so I leave him a hysterical message.  Then, I think maybe Alex and some of his jackass friends are trying to get out of work so they can go to strip clubs, speakeasys, or similar. But I call said friends, and they haven’t heard from him.  I’m still hysterical, and on my way out the door, on the phone with my dad when I see “Alex’s cell” calling on the other line.  “Hello? Lex? Hello?”  “Uh. I’m fucking fine. Jesus. Frank totally got the wrong message. I needed to get out of work, so I said I got in a fucking fender bender.”  “You fucking piece of shitty shit. Oh my god, you need to call everyone you know because you’re about to be on the evening news.”  &nbsp;  Oh what a tangled web we weave, when once my brother was a fucking idiot…

      &nbsp;  Currently, I’m house-sitting in Mill Valley. As most of you know, normally, I live deep within the ghetto, in a relatively small flat with a security system to rival a vault. Sirens wiz by every three seconds, and there’s always about 20 drunk and high Mexican men sitting out front at all hours of the day. This is where I feel perfectly safe.  Now, I’m in a huge, 4 story house, with funky passages and noises and many, many possible points of entry for rapists, murderers, and deranged maniacs. I’m high up in the mountains, and while my screams would echo beautifully into the valley, no one would come running.  Last night, I lay in bed watching Cold Case Files well into the night. The episode was about this serial killer, who would mutilate his victims before raping and then killing them. Suddenly, the floorboards creaked upstairs.  Now, the dog I’m dog-sitting, Marilyn, wouldn’t bark if 80 masked gunmen stormed in and started shooting up the place. She stayed silently by my side, as I reminded myself that the last murder in Mill Valley was in, like, 1957. The floorboards creaked again. This is a big, wooden house. Of course it’ll make noises. Right? I decided to call Andy for comfort and reassurance.  “Come over and protect me.”  “Hell no.” he replied. “I’m watching Cold Case Files. I love this shit.”  Clearly, we’re twisted soul mates, but I was really starting to get freaked out.  “Just stay on the phone with me while I check upstairs.”  “Oh great. That’s what I need. To hear my best friend get murdered.”  “Yeah, but he’ll mutilate and rape me before he murders me. You might have time to call the cops.”  With the phone in my hand, Marilyn at my side, and a wire clothes hanger, I tip toe upstairs. I double lock and deadbolt the door, check all the decks, and rustle all the clothes in the closets to make sure no one’s hiding behind them.  “Are you dead yet?”  “Fuck you.”  Clearly, no one is here. And it’s 2am.  Andy starts to whine. “I’ve got class tomorrow, you paranoid freak. Shut up about your killer and call me in the morning.”  “Okay. But if I die, I just want you to know that I love you and adore you and think you’re one of the best men I know, Andy.”  “Whatever, bitch. Take a Zanex and watch another show. I gotts ta sleep. I’ll talk to you tomorrow.”  And then, the line went dead.

      So, I'm on the phone with Andy and he's telling me about his BAVAC classes. Andy's become pals with a fortysomething, dreadlocked homo classmate named Deno. Andy invited Deno to the Tranny Shack tonight, and I said, "Oh. Like a date?"  "No, no, no. I'd never date him. Never. I would never date Deno... I wouldn't even have sex with him."

      Because we have nothing better to do, Katherine and I drove to Santa Cruz on Friday to shop for vintage clothes. Lore has it, there's a magical place there called The Bargain Barn, where clothing is a mere $1 a pound. We planned to hit The BB, and then peruse the other shops in town. After an intensely boring drive, our only form of entertainment being a book entitled, "What's Your Favorite..." and then pages and pages of categories you could have a favorite in. I think we hit rock bottom with "What's your favorite witnessed act of Christian love. (I shit you not. Ask Katherine.)  We finally arrive, and as the BB doesn't open until 1, we go have lunch at a little bistro called 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall, in which, if you drink all 99 beers available there over any amount of time, you get your name and a quote on a little plaque. Our favorite: William Kendall, August 16th, 1996, “I just came in to use the bathroom.”  Finally, we drive to the Bargain Barn, and after much query and walking, discover the mighty structure. Made of plastic siding and held together with luggies, the BB is like nothing I’ve ever seen before. Skis, beds, stuffed animals, all strewn everywhere. It looked like the front lawn of a huge Appalachian family’s encampment. We paid a mighty $2.50 for the privilege of entering this sanctuary, obtained the coveted sticker of entry, and soon joined a group of about 20 others proudly wearing their stickers as well. The big room of crap smelled, as homeless punks, thrift store owners, and illegal immigrants rummaged through barrels of filth. Needless to say, I was not getting into this at all. Then, some “employee”, wearing a t-shirt with the hand-scrawled “favorite pet”, decided to blast The B52’s. It was deafening, but awesome. I started to sing along, and here I could sing at the top of my lungs. I began to rummage with fervor while harmonizing to “Deadbeat Club.”  Suddenly, I was finding great shit. And by great, I mean, worth well over a buck a pound. I started pulling sweaters and handbags and hats. People toss with abandon, clothes are everywhere, and it’s a madhouse with a soundtrack. You have to dig at the BB. Many items are appalling. Katherine found a cardigan with a used band-aid attached. But when you find a treasure, it’s a high like no other. My treasure was a huge straw hat, the brim at least 3 feet wide. It is fabulous and movie star-like and I immediately began to imagine myself wearing it in the South of France.  The next thing I know, there a woman with horrible gray roots screaming at Katherine and I. We’re apparently stolen from her “pile.” From our arms, she proceeds to grab “her” stuff, including my prized straw hat.  “I do this for a living. I wouldn’t be such a bitch, but this is my job. You can’t take from people’s piles. It’s just the way it works.”  I was livid. “Well, then. Anything else I can offer you? Do you like my handbag? Maybe this jacket? My grandmother’s earrings? Seriously, take all you want. Claim the earth as your pile…” I was really yelling, attempting to make a point over the B52’s. She tried to ignore me and walked away. All I could think of was my hat. My beautiful straw hat. Katherine tried to perk me up with used sequin jumpsuits, but I was still devastated over the theft of my accessory.  Then, the thief has the audacity to approach us again, and inquire as to her missing beads.  “I can’t hear you.” I say. “I’m too depressed about my hat.”  She looks up. “Oh, that big straw hat? Fine. You can have it.”  I violently shove her out of the way as I dive into her pile and retrieve the hat that was destined to be mine.  “Nope. We have no idea where your shitty beads are. Later, skank.”  And with that, we grabbed our wad of recovered garbage, me proudly wearing my hat all the way to the weigh station, and departed the Bargain Barn. My two armfuls of crap cost a mere 4 bucks. That hat is worth at least a million. Mission accomplished.

      Alex and I were just in downtown Mill Valley shopping and mingling with our neighbors. We popped into Summer House, a home furnishing store for billionaires, and poked around. Suddenly, this bald guy with a stroller walks in and blocks me into the candle section. I try to get around him, he tries to get around me, we laugh, and I say, "Shall we dance?" He chuckles heartilly, and it's at this point, I realize, I'm speaking to Andre Agassi. Stefi Graff is also wandering around Summer House, and Alex and I give each other knowing looks across the store. We leave, and continue wandering around Mill Valley. We spotted the Agassi's again, this time dining on croissants and lattes at Champagne French Bakery. Alex and I take note, but are over our celeb sightings and move on. Finally, Alex dropped off back at home, and me on my way back to my housesitting gig down the block, I call Bonnie to fill her in on my superstar sighting. She's appropriately impressed, and just as I hang up with her, whom should cross the street in front of me, but Andre and entourage.  He looks up and says, "We meet again."  I smile and wave, like I bump into international celebrities in my hometown all the time, and drive on.  Andre, quit following me. If you want to go grab a drink, just ask.

      My uncle is occasionally gloriously astute. He's been reading my blogs, and apparently the posted comments, and he had this to say today... &nbsp; "...And no (I know you're thinking it) I'm not the respondee trashing your grammar on your blog.&nbsp; Besides, whoever's wearing the too tight undies apparently doesn't know their grammar from their spelling..." &nbsp; That's beautiful.  Now, he also called me a self-absorbed drunk, but I knew that years ago.  &nbsp;

      I just finished babysitting for my hairstylist, Misty. In return, she's hooking me up with highlights. Misty and her husband Jeff have 2 boys. Luke is 4 and Jake is 1. Jake, being 1 and all, isn't really a talker, so I converse mostly with Luke. I call him Lukey Loo and he calls me Bethy Beth. We watch dinosaur movies and play Chutes and Ladders. Occasionally, we go outside and play on the jungle gym or chat with the scary looking construction workers next door.  I've decided Luke is a genius, and here's why.  1. He screams, "I love you Bethy Beth!" every 10 minutes. 2. He told me I was the prettiest princess he'd ever seen. 3. He found subtext in Shrek I never noticed. 4. He proclaimed, "Peanut Butter goes on everything, even me!" 5. He kicked my ass at Connect Four, and I wasn't trying to loose. &nbsp; I love you, Lukey Loo!

      This is horribly pathetic, but it's all I can think about, so clearly, it's all I'll write about...  So many years ago, when I was the costume bitch at Beach Blanket Babylon, I worked with a god. His name is David, he's wonderfully British, and he's married. Or at least he was. At work, I was barely able to function, I was so madly in love with him. Seriously, I cannot express to you how much I adored David. We'd hang out at Capp's for hours, him with his Newcastle, me with my vodka tonic and lots of lime, talking about England and fashion and how much work sucked. He could read me the dictionary, with that accent. Just keep talking... I could go on for days, but I digress. Anyway, things sucked so much at Beach Blanket that David quit (in a dramatic and bold storming out that is still spoken of in hushed tones), left his wife, and joined the military. I mean really, could he get any hotter? He'd return periodically, in magical and fabulous ways, but I haven't seen him in, like, 2 years.  The last time I ran into him, Zoe and I were watching a friend's band perform at the Lost and Found Saloon in North Beach. All of a sudden, I see the BBB sound guy, Rick, walk in with this beyond foxy creature in a white dress shirt and perfect khakis. Rick comes over and starts talking to us, while his mysterious, hot friend is at the bar. All of a sudden, a vodka tonic with lots of lime slides right up in front of me. I looked up and it was David. Zoe magically disappears from the seat next to me, goes outside to call her husband and explain why we'll now be home incredibly late, and leaves me to drool over David. He was marvelous, hilarious, and as always, fabulously flirty. I kissed him goodbye for about an hour, and that's the last I ever saw of him.  Through the never-ending BBB grapevine, I've heard David is on his way home. Today.  Holy Shit. He's been in Bagdhad (turns out, war is better than working backstage) for over a year, where he's been jumping out of Blackhawks (I know. How hot is that...), and is finally coming back. Again, today. And, with his predilection for showing up magically and rocking my world, I will leave the house dressed to the nines until I see him. Andy pointed out that he may arrive with his new wife, some Persian Princess or Afghani refugee. But I don't care. The man is a god, people. A god. Holy shit, you guys. David's coming back. To-fucking-day.   And now, an example of David's genius.  Beth: So, David. What are you doing for Thanksgiving? David: Well, I'm an Englishman in America, so I think I'll do what my forefathers did. Beth: What's that? David: Find a Native American, rape his wife, give him smallpox, and turn him into an alcoholic.   ...and that's the moment I fell in love...

      I just returned from the San Francisco Hall of Justice, where I seem to be spending a lot of time lately. This visit was spent getting an extension for Jury Duty, which I’ve been putting off since 1997. Upon arrival at the Hall of Justice, one must pass through a metal detector and submit all handbags for inspection. I’ve done this many times before, and needless to say, there’s never been a problem. Standing in line surrounded by criminals, I am suddenly singled out and the contents of my bag were emptied on a desk for all to examine. The security guard then pulls out my birth control pills and actually asks me, “What this?” A female criminal began to snicker.  “Um, those are my birth control pills. Thanks for holding them up in the air.” “And what this?” he asked, holding my back-up pair of earrings.  “It’s my backup pair of earrings.” say I. Another criminal pipes up. “Back up earrings? What for?” The snickering female criminal, in a rare moment of sisterhood, replies, “In case she forget to accessorize, motherfucker.” The entire line erupts into laughter, and I’m waved on through. I grab my bag, pills, and earrings, shoot a dirty look to the security guard, and make my way to Jury Room 307.  Because I’m asking for an extension, there are no lines, and I walk directly up to the desk. I’m given some shitty form to fill out, and am told to take a seat and pick an upcoming Monday to complete my service. The Jury Room is empty, so I pick a middle table and proceed to fill out said form. Suddenly, a huge Samoan pulls out a chair and sits right next to me. In a room filled with at least 30 tables and hundreds of chairs, we sit alone and pretend to ignore each other. Our proximity to each other began to make me uncomfortable, so I decided to speak.  “Jury Duty is complete bullshit.” (It’s all I could come up with.) Tiny continues writing and ignoring me. I try again. “I mean, I wouldn’t want me on my jury. I’m clearly an idiot. And I have the attention span of a toddler.” Still, nothing.  I shut up, finish my form, and turn it in. Tiny is still furiously scrawling away at his form. I turn to leave the Jury Room and he yells after me, “I’ll see you later.” What? I don’t recall making plans. Now, I’m home, with the door dead bolted and the alarm on. I was at the Hall of Justice for about 20 minutes, and I’ve returned feeling violated and stalked. I believe this is why people live in the suburbs…

      Blow Out is my new favorite show. It's a reality show on Bravo about this salon and all of the drama and hijinks that go on there. It's run by this huge queen named Jonathan. If you haven't seen it, watch it. It's fabulous. However, I appear to be the only one around that is positive he's entirely gay. I assumed he was out and proud until I watched that episode which has him waking up in bed with some supermodel passed out in bed next to him. Hi, overcompensation. I was shocked to see this, and expressed this shock to Bonnie.  "What are you talking about?" she replied. "He's so straight." Are you fucking blind and deaf? Days later, I'm chatting on the phone with Jason.  "You know what my new show is?" he asks. "Blow Out." "I know, I know." I say. "Isn't Jonathan totally gay." "What are you talking about?" he says. "He's not gay." Hello, people. He's a stylist in Seven jeans, with a faux tan, and constant drama. He throws temper tantrums and once screamed at someone on the phone and then tossed his designer cell into a dumpster for dramatic effect. He's a total nelly queen. Gay, gay, gay. I'm an expert on very few things, but this is one of them. My God, he makes Carson Kressley look like John Wayne.

      Last night, I had a very intense and realistic dream involving myself and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, who, as we all know, is a stone cold fox. In said dream, we were highly romantically involved AND he wrote me a letter of recommendation for some job I wanted. It was fabulous. I just woke up and couldn't figure out why I'm in such a good mood, especially considering I'm on my way to Jury Duty. But here I am, skipping around, making coffee, and I suddenly realized, I'm not actually having an affair with Gavin. My sub-conscious is fucking with me and toying with my emotions. But, damn, that was one hell of a dream. It was so realistic, I recall walking around HIS apartment in HIS bathrobe. Hello? How marvelous is that... I'm going to go try and go back to sleep. Here I come, Gavy!

      When I was younger, I always knew I was the weird girl. I would make every effort to reign in my bizarreness, but without fail, I'd always end up lying in bed thinking, "Golly. I really am pretty weird, and I'm confident I'm not the only one that thinks so." I'd go to Christmas parties or Basketball Banquets, and ahead of time, prep myself.  Okay, Beth. Stay in the background, blend in, don't try and talk.   But lo and behold, I'd return from said party having done it again. My need to orchestrate large scale theatrical numbers and stage contests always took over. At the time, I'd be positive that explaining my need to wrap tablecloths around my party dress made me fashion forward and cosmopolitan. Somehow, creating complex trivia games or reenacting New Kids on the Block videos entirely solo never got the reactions I expected. I noticed that other kids were loud and opinionated as well, but never quite as strange as myself. I mean, I'm pretty sure I was the only one that tried to start a club called the Ovary Brigade in the bathroom of the Olympic Club during the Father Daughter Dance, crowning myself Queen of the Fallopian Tubes. But, I felt certain that as time passed, my sensibilities would morph into normalcy and I'd grow into a socially acceptable personality.  Not so much.  A few months ago, I broke the dryer. 26 years old and home alone at 10am, with the dryer door open and clothes lying all over the place, I dressed up as Beyonce, fully accessorized and made up, and performed an intense, pre-choreographed routine to "Crazy in Love" that resulted in my falling off a chair and landing on the open dryer door, essentially breaking it off the dryer. What's worse, I completed the song, before calling Bonnie and explained why we couldn't use the dryer. At work, whenever I'd request Ben play me some Beyonce, he'd reply, "Nope. You might break the copy machine."  It's now July, and I'm sitting here listening to Christmas music, working on a painting inspired by an episode of ALF I watched last night, and about to crank call Andy and leave him bizarre messages.  I think I get it, now. I'm weird. Strange. Curious, even. I prefer the term eccentric. I'm stuck this way, with nothing to do but embrace it. But, really, I still do lie in bed at night and think to myself, "Yep. I'm still the weird girl. I've got to work on that."  But I won't. Because, in reality, being the weird girl means that the pussies are easily scared off and those that stay around tend to be far more interesting and willing to play Celebrity Password at a moment's notice. And really, those are the kind of people a weird girl needs in her life.  So, thanks gang, thanks.

      In watching the West Wing, which, if you’ve been reading, you’ll know I do with up to thrice daily frequency, I’ve begun to take notice of the eclectic range of guest stars they have. Recently, I’ve become obsessed with the fact that Gerald McRaney, TV’s “Major Dad”, plays a general. This guy is always military. He’s completely typecast, save when he appeared on Designing Women as Delta Burke’s ex-husband. And isn’t it interesting, that of the two of them, he’s still working. And she’s hocking washable silk to fat poor women.  None the less, Gerald McRaney has made a career of playing the “by the books” major, lieutenant, colonel, whatever. He’s the go-to guy for your “uptight, but is really a nice guy” military type.   We need a blue collar 4 star general with a heart of gold…is Major Dad available? Yep, he is. And, he’s probably pretty cheap, too.

      Today, my friend Jason and I went shopping in Union Square. Jason, being the straight that he is, can’t pick out his own clothes, and as I am happy to shop 24/7, we often peruse the current designer lines together. Our favorite place to check out menswear is The Saks Fifth Avenue Men’s Store, Fifth Floor Designer Sportswear. The fifth floor is where all the Prada, Gucci, Yamamoto, etc. is. It’s also where Ryan is. Ryan looks like a 12 year old Cambodian boy dressed by Donnatella Versace. He’s kind of whiny and impish, and he takes couture very seriously. Jason and I find him a great source of interest and ridicule and often make a point of interacting with him. In fact, we refer to shopping as “visiting Ryan.“ Today, Ryan and I had a pow-wow regarding my sequined flip flops. Ryan loves them. He’s going to buy several pairs of them for his “guests” to use at his apartment. Can you imagine going to visit your little friend Ryan, the designer retail diva, and discover upon your arrival at his fabulously appointed flat that you’ve been offered sequined flip flops for your comfort. I fucking love this guy.  He’s so beautifully and ironically out of touch with fashion, he confused my Old Navy jacket and skirt for Prada and Theory, and was shocked to learn that the cost of my entire look was about $30. I decided to find it charming instead of sad, as we love our Ryan so, but I must admit I’m a little disappointed he’s got such a shitty eye. I think my neighbor, Big Juan, probably knows the difference between Old Navy and Prada. Why doesn’t Ryan? I want to know everything about Ryan. Where’s he from? Who does he date? How does he afford all this designer shit? I think Jason and I should take him out and befriend him. I want Ryan at my parties, telling me how “divine” my accessories are and sipping his mojito. He adds such flavor and entertainment value to our shopping, one can only imagine the pizzazz he brings to one’s personal life.  So, dear Ryan, if you’re reading this, the girl in the sequined flops and the guy with the natural highlights adore you.  Find us, and make our lives extraordinary.

      Dear John Cusack, 						 You make me re-fall in love with you every time you speak. You make me love Chicago. You make me expect more from men. I would follow your trench tails to the ends of the earth. I would save any phone message you left me for the entirety of my life. I would totally get along with your sister.  Lloyd Dobbler changed the way I looked at the opposite sex. And really, that role in Say Anything is the greatest manifestation of your fabulousness. The best thing about Lloyd was his consistency. Lloyd was not about bullshit. He committed to Diane. He possessed focus. He wasn’t like some of the jackasses I have come to know, who seem like Lloyd at the beginning, but then turn into neglectful, cranky, disinterested jerks.  Moving on, so few can pull off sweet and cool and innocent and street-smart and vulnerable all at the same time. Lloyd had a deep simplicity, if that‘s possible. And let me tell you, it is intoxicating. But most importantly of all, John, you were the star of the most profound romantic moment in film history. I’m speaking, of course, of the “In Your Eyes” boom box scene. Each time I see it, I am overwhelmed in new and intense ways. In addition to the brilliance captured in the final cut of Say Anything, deleted scenes on the DVD reveal an even more personal and moving performance in that moment. Thank you.  To be honest, I secretly first fell for you in The Journey of Natty Gann (1985), but I could never admit, even at 7, that I loved that retarded movie. God, how I loved you in that. You were so wonderfully protective and resourceful, like a slightly hipper, younger, more brooding MacGuyver. You seemed so fun to be around in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. I just wanted to explore bizarre Southern cities with you and crash debutante balls and plantation weddings. Conveniently enough, I get along famously with drag queens as well. However, in Being John Malkovitch, all I desperately wanted was to have your hair professionally styled. I hated your hair in that movie. Never do that to me again.  High Fidelity was heaven and hell for me. Rob did not posses Lloyd’s devotion. And it is the devotion that I so adore. Rob found so many faults with every woman he encountered. It made me self conscious, and I like to think that you would love me as I am, forever and ever and ever. But Rob was super cool, and who doesn’t love a Top 5 list. I should make a Top 5 list of all the things I love about you. Top 5? Ha! Try Top 5 Million.  John, even in all too brief celluloid moments, like your moving turn as the dead older brother in Stand By Me, you were remarkable and memorable.  Your talent overwhelms me. Your constant black trench coat excites me. But most of all, your sophisticated wit and charming essence define my being. And even though, you feel the need to occasionally assault my soul, (Anastasia, Serendipity, etc.) I know you truly are the greatest living man on our fine planet.  Contact me immediately.  Warmest Regards,  Beth Spotswood

      Today, while driving over to Katherine's to use her computer (which I'm now on), I tuned into my beloved KOIT and am somewhat embarassed to say that "I Hope You Dance" by some country bumpkin was playing, and I secretly love that song. Looking back on the Chaka Khan fiasco, I thought, Fuck it, and sang my little heart out.  I was rewarded with George Michael's "Faith" and Bill Whithers "Ain't No Sunshine." Needless to say, I've pretty much lost my voice. KOIT rules.

      Zoe and I were both bored out of our minds last night, and as it was a rare occasion that Zoe didn't have to slave over the cursed costumes at Beach Blanket, we felt the need to utilize this opportunity and hit the town.  Seated on the floor of Zoe's flat with maps and tour books in front of us, we couldn't agree on where to go. We wanted an experience, you see, and had no desire to patronize our usual haunts. Thus, we spent a solid hour looking up random establishments that struck us as bizarre and experience-worthy. We decided on some place called Sherlock's, on the 30th floor of the Crown Plaza Hotel. Envisioning it as some kind of British, mystery-themed, tourist establishment, we delighted in the prospect of some sort of trivia contest or similar. We found street parking (possibly the most notable event of the evening) and walked to the hotel. The Crown Plaza is a shitty looking hotel, that smells quite similar to a dorm room refridgerator, and the staff there is mildly retaded at best. We hopped an elevator to the 30th floor and emotionally prepared ourselves for the bizarre experience we felt sure we would find.  There is no longer a Sherlock's on the 30th floor of the Crown Plaza Hotel. There is a cheezy mauve banquet room, a dumpster, and a white courtesy phone, but there is no turn of the century themed pub with fireplaces and mystery games. Fuck! Next, we tried Harry Denton's Starlight Room. We rode the elevator with 3 gentlemen of questionable intelligence and entered the club. After being carded twice, we were told there was a $20 cover. Fuck! We walked over to The St. Francis Hotel, as I remembered there being some sort of hoppin' club at the top, and decided we'd rather drop our $20 on top shelf liquor than pay to get our asses grabbed at the Starlight Room. As fate would have it, there was a private party there, and a Janet Reno-esque woman shoved us back on the elevator while drunkedly trying to pick up a petite, poorly dressed businessman. Fuck! Frustrated and curious as to why god insisted we not have an experience, I recalled a bar near the Stockton/Sutter garage that always looked kinda cool. We headed over there, cursing Janet Reno and joking as to what could be wrong with this place. Well, I'll tell you what was wrong with it. It's closed for renovations, with caution tape and everything. Fuck! Finally, ready to give up and down our booze in the comfort of Zoe's living room, we walked one last block and discovered The Irish Bank. Located in an alley off Bush Street, The Irish Bank is a pub straight from the dole lines of Dublin. Filled with drunken Irishmen and hideous women, Zoe and I had finally found our experience. We ordered our wine and cider, like the suburban wenches we are, and decided the benches outside in the alley were preferrable to the long tables of profanity inside.  Within minutes, we were surrounded by Irishmen, all having come from a Giants game and desperate to chat with random American women snobbilly sipping their libations. Michael is an electrician and fascinated by peep shows and strippers. Johnny looks like the villian in Kindergarten Cop, but is lovely and a little quiet. Emyn is gorgeous, polite, and very into the Tour de France. And Rory was the best dressed, and had a very manly handshake which I enjoyed immensly. There were various others, of course, but I didn't catch their names. There Zoe and I sat, surrounded by The Committments and attempting to decipher their drunken brogues. It was really quite marvelous.  After a few drinks and a few inviataions to do god knows what, we took our leave and laughed all the way home, debating which drunkard was the hottest. (We decided on Emyn) I'd say we got our experience, and needless to say, I think you know where we'll be next Wednesday night.

      My good friend Katherine won a bunch of free tickets to the Punchline and invited me along. I, in turn, invited Andy, my beloved homosexual companion. Andy and I met Katherine and her husband there, and along with 2 other couples I barely knew, we entered the club and ordered drinks.  I often bitch about being single. I moan and complain and curse the gods. I wonder aloud how someone so charming and occasionally attractive could be so universally rejected. And I can't fathom why the only men who find me breathtaking are the elderly or incarcerated. Last night, I thanked my lucky stars. We sat there, the 8 of us, and heard 5 or 6 comedians of various talent levels perform. Some were grand, some sucked ass. Regardless, I was really watching the 3 couples at my table. And I was bored. They sat, with their hands in their laps, laughing when appropriate and sipping their non-alcoholic beverages. By their apparel, I could tell they no longer cared how they looked to each other. Physical contact was obligitory, and everything was "us" or "we."  "We don't like bananas." "We'll have diet cokes." "We're going to the bathroom." Jesus Christ. I was ready to kill myself. The kicker, and this is entirely my snobbery and judgement, was when one couple ordered hot chocolate with whipped cream and sprinkles. We're at a bar, people, with commedians on stage   who will readilly mock that beverage. Grow some balls and get a fucking beer, little girl. They might as welll have ordered Shirley Temples.  I sat there, loving Katherine, but wanting no part of this lifestyle of joint checking accounts and moderate drinking. I looked over at my opposite-sexuality life partner, Andy Jay Jolley, and proposed.

      Yesterday, fate and possibly karma required that I take care of some business with the fine folks at the Department of Motor Vehicles. I opted to go to the Marin DMV because my car is registered in Marin and the lines are significantly shorter than the Ellis Island-esque San Francisco DMV. One would imagine that the Marin DMV line, short as it is, would be filled with the likes of trophy wives in tennis skirts and illegal immigrants. Turns out, not so much.  In front of me was a butch lesbian, in men’s clothing, with her keys attached to her belt loops and a necklace made out of wild animal teeth. Behind me was a young, black mother of three, with a gold tooth marked with $. Her youngest child, appearing no older than three had a diamond earring and a huge diamond encrusted medallion. All three children roamed wildly about the room, knocking over sign stands and accusing each other of “fronting.” When you arrive at the Marin DMV, there appears to be some sort of concierge at the front door, screaming “Hello!!!” in her puffy paint sweatshirt with squirrels on it. I approached her desk, and noticed in small cursive at the bottom of her squirrel image, the appalling, “Branson, Missouri.” She inquired as to my DMV needs, and promptly sent me to the end of the line. She did this with everyone. I began to realize, as I watched her and waited in line, she’s simply some sort of very nosy woman who’s fascinated by the various reasons anyone would spend a glorious Friday afternoon in the bureaucratic hell that is The Department of Motor Vehicles. She is not employed by the state, and those that are find it too effortful to remove her.  Actual DMV employees remind me of a propaganda documentary I saw as a child, depicting Russian Communist workers as slackers with no sense of urgency, work ethic, or customer service. Those of us in line stare down the people at each window, desperate to predict which one will be done first. I smile at the fast people, people who understand that the most important thing is to get out with as much efficiency and speed as possible. I smile at the employees who appear to know what they’re doing, hoping my turn falls on one of them. And I glare at those that look upon their time at the window as a personal government class, asking every stupid question under the sun and then proceeding to be ill-prepared.  One man at the window left his insurance card in his car. “That’s okay,” said the wench behind the window, “I’ll wait.” Are you shitting me? You snooze, you loose, pal. I came prepared and I should be rewarded for doing so.  Finally, my turn came. I hiked over to Window 17, where “Lodovico” informed me I had a little unpaid parking ticket issue. No shit, Lodovico. Mind your business and give me my fucking tags. I’ve been in line over there in Calcutta and I’m ready to go home.  Finally free, and in possession of the fucking sticker “the man” requires I suffer for, I break free into the sunshine as affix the yellow tag to Rhonda the Honda, or as she’s become known of late, The Silver Bullet. With the knowledge that, at least for the next 30 days, I’m finally legally allowed to drive my car, I cut across the double lines and speed past the Corte Madera police station. Fuck you, coppers! I’ve played your game and now I’m free…

      Who are these people commenting on my blogs? Where do they come from and why do they care? I love it, don't get me wrong. But I assume that the only people reading this shit are my bored friends checking to see if I've ripped on them.  Now, I feel some sort of responsibility to write something profound, because "Gil" might have another comment to make.  Who the fuck are you, Gil? Does this make any sense to you? Are you single?

      I tend towards the dramatic. (Understatement of century) I create it, I encourage it, I wallow in it. If I go a week without a crisis, I think I get bored.  I bring this up, because this moring, I dramatically overreacted. Now, of course, I still believe I'm right and everyone else is wrong. That's a given. But, the events which resulted in my hysterics aren't really that big a deal. No one meant to rip my beating heart from my chest and crush it before my face. People simply got obscenely drunk and did stupid, stupid things which I took as an assault on my soul. This happens with some frequency.  So, I say it here. The drama is ending. No more drama for Spotswood. I've had enough. Really. I mean it this time. I'm not fucking around anymore.   Aren't you all desperate to know what happened? That's a book, honey. Not a blog.

      But before I get to that...a day of travel: We awoke at 5:30am and were greeted in the lobby by our old pal, Mr. Yen. He drove us to the Guilin Airport where we literally walked right onto the plane and found our seats. Unfortunately, we were surrounded by 50 pushy German tourists who kept dropping their huge carry-ons on Alex's head. I shot them dirty looks and kept mumbling something about the gestapo under my breath. After a 45 minute flight on South China Airlines to Guangzhou (formerly Canton), we landed and attempted to disembark. The Germans, however, had some extreme need to get off the plane before the doors were even opened, prompting a loud and annoyed, "You need to chill out." from me. At the luggage terminal, there was no sign of a guide to take us to the train station, so I was sent to the greeting area and was promised my bag would be located and taken care of. Wandering around the airport looking for someone holding a sign saying anything resembling "Spotswood", I mistook 3 people for our guide before finally finding him. A middle-aged Chinese guy that spoke great English, he introduced himself as "Kelly" and informed me that the drive to the train station would take 45 minutes, and the high speed train ride to Hong Kong another hour and 50 minutes. Fine. I'm normally not even awake yet, so what do I care. The family found the bags, including mine, and headed over to meet us. Mom kept calling him "Kenny", but otherwise, it was pretty easy getting to the train station, all the way across Guangzhou, aparently the biggest city in Southeast China. The train station resembled Calcutta during a Ghandi speech, and we were forced to fight our way past the chickens, goats, and legless beggars to the ticket counter. Informed that they only took cash, and my father now famous for being consistently cash free, we ran Amazing Race style to an ATM, and with much help from me, dad was able to aquire some scratch. As Hong Kong is considered foreign still, with different money and English as the official language, we had to go through customs and get a SARS test, which consisted of lasers in our eyes and some machine that magically took our temperature. With minutes to spare, we made our train and had a lovely ride to Hong Kong. We spent our last yuen on a gross train-prepared lunch and dad seemed to worry the entire time about getting some HK dollars at the train station. Ya know, I bet they have ATM's there too. They did indeed, and as soon as we went through customs again, and more SARS laser tests, we found said ATM and a taxi line. I cannot express to you the level of BO I encountered in that taxi line, but I think it's fair to say it was substantial. So having traveled by van, plane, train, and taxi, all in one morning, we pulled up to the world famous Penninsula Hotel in Hong Kong and here I am. As we entered the lobby, a string quartet played "Yesterday" from a balcony overhead. I looked up and smiled at them. They looked down and smiled at me. I was tempted to request "I think I'm Gonna Like it Here" from Annie, but thought I should probably play it cool. Shops in the lobby include Manolo Blahnik, Tiffany and Co., and the ever-present Armani. Out bathroom has a flat-screen TV with DVD player built into the marble wall, and the robes are plusher than anything I've ever felt in my life. Our 23rd floor room has a view of metro Hong Kong, and a Philipe Stark designed retaurant and bar on the top floor is open till 2am. On my way down to the Business Center, where I have my own office, mind you, I chatted with the bell boy about where the hip and happening party here. Now, I've got the scoop and plan to hobknob with the jetsetters upstairs once the folks hit the hay. We're here for four nights, leaving bright and early Sunday moring. And no, dear Andy, I return on the 22nd, not the 23rd. In fact, we leave HK at 11am Sunday moring and arrive in SFO at 9am. This is one crazy planet. I must say, after an exhausting day of travel and new and unexpected smells, it's all been worth it. I shall now retire to my room, steam my gown, and plan my next three days. I have one fantasy in Hong Kong, and the family has agreed to it. I want to spend one evening alone, drinking alone and dining alone. I have this fantasy of myself as the mysterious, American woman travelling alone at the Penninsula Hotel, dressed fabulously, reading a book at a table alone. I want everyone to wonder who I am and what I'm doing here, and I don't want to talk to anyone I'm related to. The key word is alone. Alone. Alone. Alone. You people have 3 days of freedom left. Send your last minute requests for Chinese curios and I'll do my damdest. And now, to tea...

      I should be curled up in bed asleep, as I have to be on a plane in hours, however the events of the past few hours are too bizarre and I'm terrified I'll forget them. Tonight, Mr. Yen picked us up and took us to some hotel, where we were to have dinner and a cultural show. We were ushered into a huge atrium auditorium, where only 2 other people sat, both Americans. A stage, with a large digital screen above it, was at the center, and hundereds of empty tables and chairs surrounded it. We were then presented with a fixed menu, and discovered our meal would consist of prawn salad, minestrone, steak and a baked potato, banana pancakes, fruit, and coffee. We were also allowed one cocktail each. Dad and Alex chose beer, as mom opted for her traditional Chardonnay, and I ordered Evian, which was apparently extra, but I'm taking no chances with this water. We also ordered a bottle of our now standard wine, Great Wall, and all agreed that this would be incredibly wierd if there were only 6 people in the audience. Dad, carrying only cash as he's now terrified of pickpockets, asked if anyone else brought money. No, why would we. Dinner arrived, but no other guests. At this point, mom and I got the giggles. Dad pointed out that he felt perfectly fine, and wouldn't care if he were the only one in the audience. The trick was to clap fast, as it would seem there were hundereds of us. Finally, just as the show was about to start, maybe 10 more people joined us in this huge theater, although they didn't eat. Wise of them, but live and learn. Mom expressed concern that the stairs leading up to the stage inplied audience participation, but I pointed out this was traditional, minority Chinese dance. How could they integrate us? The show began, with a woman dressed in sparkly Tibetian attire, and in broken English, welcomed us. Above her, on the digital screen, scrolled her lines, just in case we couldn't understand her. This continued throughout the performance, with every 10th word misspelled. The cast consisted of 10 tiny Asian gals and 4 Asian queens, who took their roles far more seriously than their female counterparts. Dressed initially in a combination of Martian and peasant, I was instantly enthralled. The dances, which could have been choreographed by Paula Abdul's less talented assistant, was hilarious, as were the ever changing, over the top costumes. It looked like a Saturday Night Live sketch, although we weren't supposed to laugh. I could do nothing but wish my friends were there to witness this event, as words don't exist to adequetly describe it. In every country, under any circumstance, if someone is going to get pulled onstage, it's going to be Alex Spotswood. Starting at age 10, getting his head chopped off by a magician on a Carribean cruise, Alex always seems to find himself hand in hand with some scantilly clad hussy getting dragged into the spotlight. He's a big, tall pretty boy who's always a good sport. God bless him, tonight was no different. Twice, I repeat, twice, the boy dived in and performed, beautifully, I might add. In hysterics, I snapped away at my disposable as he made faces at us from the stage. With about 15 people in the entire audience, he felt perfectly comfortable hamming it up. As he descended the stage, I shouted, "Fabulous! Encore!" at the top of my lungs. The show lasted far too long and had about as much to do with traditional Chinese minority culture as the Starbucks on every corner. As it was finally time to go, and meet Mr. Yen in the lobby, the bill arrived. Dad looked it over, and then looked up in horror. "I don't have enough money." My mother, finding this the most hilarious thing ever to occur, couldn't speak she was laughing so hard. It was agreed that Alex go run and get 10 yuen from Mr. Yen. "Mr. Yen, I apologize, really. God, I'm so sorry. We're 10 yuen short." He returns with the 10 yuen ($1.30 US) only to find we're 20 yuen short. Again, he runs into the lobby to find Mr. Yen. With the bill finally paid with borrowed money, we agree to get the hell out of there. Laughing so hard we can barely stand, we agree that begging this poor, old Chinese guy for 3 bucks is far better than washing dishes in the back, even if there were only six of them. I cannot belive that a) we agreed to go to such a bizarre showcase of Chinese bad taste, and b) that my father, who drives a car that costs more than a condo in Guilin, was 3 bucks short on our bill. Oh. My. God.

      China seems to have selective communism, although that that is communism is pretty out there. Mom's fascinated by the whole "one-child rule" and asks about it often. Apparently, if you're pregnant with your second child and can't afford to bribe the government, soldiers will come in the dead of night and forcibly take you to have an abortion. The government regulates ALL newspapers, as news should inspire and encourage the people. Oh, in America, we like our news to inform the people. All judges and juries are for show, while a government central committee really decides the fates of criminals, with firing squad death penalty given to murderers, drug dealers, and bank robbers. Guilin, the town I'n in now, has a population of 500,000 and an average of 33 criminals are put to death here every year. I spent a month selling cheap joints in college. Had I done so here, I'd be tied to a pole and exectued. The thing about being in some tiny fishing town in the middle of nowhere, with my baggage at it's maximum, means I can't shop and explore what interests me and get massages. I'm actually forced to learn about the country I'm in. Apparently, this is why most people travel in the first place. Turns out, it's kinda interesting. I don't really want to pontificate in some pseudo-intellectual diatribe about why China is so backwards and our way of doing things is much better, but quite frankly, it is. Communism has never worked, even selective communism as they have here, and I can see why. Sure, there's free enterprise, but it's found through bribery and exploitation of the poor and uneduated. The fact of the matter is, no one is truly free to say what they want or live how they please. Women lack all power, and while most work, they earn far less than their male counterparts. True in America as well, obviously, but the gap is dramatically wider here. It's shocking and sad, particularly as America and China do so much business. Why can't we smoke Cuban cigars but purchase Coke produced here? It doesn't make sense, and while I have no idea what it's like to live in Cuba, it can't be any worse than China. And now, for my judgemental commentary on the past 24 hours...Last night, we passed up the "Forest Gump Restaurant" and hit some joint that had both Western and Eastern food, pleasing everyone. Alex and I headed back to the hotel to watch Olympic weightlifting, while mom and dad walked around and shopped. We awoke this moring to meet Mr. Yen in the lobby to head off to our Li River Cruise. Occasionally, Mr. Yen's cell rings, and mom and I can't seem to stiffle giigles as he's chosen "We Wish You a Merry Christmas" as his ringtone. At the docks, we're hustled onto one of several huge, old, ferry-type boats, the Westerners being separated from the Chinese tourists. Apparently, the Chinese tourists pay half-price. We were on a boat with a bunch of Italians, who sucked down Marlboro's like there was no tomorrow. The boat ride was pretty spectacular, and Mr. Yen hid himself well. Occasionally, he'd show up to point out to strangely shaped hill, and we'd all pretend to see the lion or steamboat or pumpkin he'd point out. A few hours into the ride, we had a buffet lunch of disgusting Chinese food and french fries. I knew the food was inedible, as we could see it being prepared on the other tourist boats that flanked us. The kitchens, you see, were open decks at the back of each boat. A fishing raft would pull up and hand over live fish, which the "chef" would then grab and bang against the floor of the ferry until the fish was nearly dead. I decided to pass on most of the buffet, especially considering my recent bout with parasitic SARS. The boats docked in the early afternoon in Yangshou, an even tinier fishing villiage packed with hikers and climbers, here for the mountaineering. It truly looked like Southeast Asia, which is essentially, where we are. I bought a communist t-shirt and drinkable water. After wandering around Yangshou, we drove the hour back to the hotel quizzing Mr. Yen on all things Chinese. "We make-uh much lice here." "Oh yes." says dad. "We make rice in California too." A pause. "But not as much as you make here." Mom lost it. No shit dad. This is China. My father is famous for stating or asking the bizarre, in the interest of appearing informed or interested. His last famous quote occured 3 years ago, while on safari in South Africa. In the middle of the bush, guided by Jerome, the Matt Damon-esque safari guide I'm still waiting for to come and whisk me away, we stop to observe hippos in a small pool of water. "Now Jerome," says dad, "What's the difference between Rhinoceros' and Hippopotomous'?" About the same as cats and dogs, dad. Finally back at the hotel, we're being taken to some Chinese minority dance show this evening. Tomorrow, we leave at the break of dawn, literally, on a plane for Canton, where we then take a train to Hong Kong. Thus, I should be in Hong Kong by tomorrow afternoon, on a real computer which might be able to post these blogs. Hong Kong is still considered a foreign country by the Chinese and thus, we must spend our remaining yuen before tomorrow afternoon. Considering I have about 25 yuen left ($3), I don't think that'll be a problem.

      Last night was our final night in Beijing. To celebrate, I decided to have a solo drink in the lobby bar. To know me is to know I love hotel bars, and I find nothing more pleasant than sitting in an upscale one, drinking my Cabernet and silently observing those around me. I chose a table towards the middle and ordered something French sounding. I then proceeded to pretend to read my book while taking inventory. I was instantly delighted to notice I was the only young woman sitting alone and there were 3, yep three, hot, young guys sitting alone at different tables. I made the requisite eye contact with each of them and then began to fantasize about all of the fabulous reasons they would each be in Beijing. The one sitting closest to me was obviously American, reading a Nick Hornby novel and drinking beer. Another was a stunning black guy dressed in Paul Smith and drinking something girly. I made a note that we had a possible homo. The 3rd appeared a little too backpacky for me, but what the fuck. I'm in Beijing. Beggars can't be choosers. I did the occasional look up from the book and smile, although the only one staring back and smiling was the hot black dude. Homo confirmation. A group of 20 year old Brazillian soccer players were sitting at the bar, and had finished their drinks and left. A few of them stood yards away, by a huge floral arrangement, and I noticed them looking at me and giggling. Suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I saw two approaching me. "Excuse me." they both appeared terrified. I looked up and smiled. "Hi." "Yes" said the obvious leader, "Can my friend have one of these?" He pointed to a Pingle sitting in the silver dish before me. (The Chinese are obsessed with Pringles. Even at the fanciest of bars, I'm always presented with them. Mom says it's because they travel so well.) "Of course. You may have them all!" He nervously grabbed a single Pringle and they both ran off, high fiving their compatriots and turning around shooting me huge smiles. I laughed, at which point the Nick Hornby guy looked up and laughed to. A ha! My chance. I considered sending over a note and a drink, and as soon as I mustered the courage, who shows up but my brother. Hornby shoved his head back in the novel and that was the end of that. Foiled! We went to dinner at a terribly fancy place called Aria, where I spent the evening dodging the stares from a hideous businessman at the next table, resembling a less atractive Mr. Kotter. Dinner, however was fabulous, and I had an incredible foir gras with tomato chutney that blew my mind. Today, we left at the break of dawn and arrived in Guilin after a 3 hour flight on Hainan Airlines. No, I've never heard of it either. Guilin is a tiny fishing villiage, about 200 miles from Vietnam. This makes sense, as it looks exactly like Vietnam does, at least in the movies. We were greeted by our guide, Mr. Yen. Hardly a 20-something Asian beauty queen, Alex descibed Mr. Yen as resembling the evil villian in a James Bond movie. "A-welcome to-a Guilin. Me take-a you to hotel and den we see da caves of magic and you very long flight. You rook at lice patties." Oh dear. Oh dear indeed. As our rooms weren't ready yet, Mr. Yen took us directly to the aforementioned caves, which resembled the Small World ride at Disneyland. The caves, once an amazing example of nature's artistyry, had been turned into a colored lights show by the Chinese government. We immediately insisted on going back to the hotel and relaxing, as tomorrow is a 7 hour boat ride down the Li River and then a dinner and cultural performance designed to make tourists think China's got their shit together. The thing is, they don't. Not around here, at least. Mr. Yen kept pointing out all these empty buildings, apparently once lived in by locals but then kicked out by the government in order to develop the property into money-making businesses. Problematically, they can't develop anything. No one wants to rent. So they remain empty, and the people that were once perfectly happy living there are given a thrid of the value of their property and sent ot the country. Nice. Guilin is tiny compared to Shanghai and Beijing, and about 20 years behind both. We've been warned sevral times about thieves and robbers, and I'm now, of course, terribly paranoid. More importantly, however, I have to run as my dad and Alex are a half an hour ahead of me at the 2 for 1 drink special at the bar. And they do have, oddly enough, a killer Sangria.

Guilin is tiny compared to Shanghai and Beijing, and about 20 years behind both. We've been warned sevral times about thieves and robbers, and I'm now, of course, terrible paranoid. More importantly, however, I have to run as my dad and Alex are a half an hour ahead of me at the 2 for 1 drink special at the bar. And they do have, oddly enough, a killer Sangria.

      Oh, what a difference a day makes. The dreaded tapeworm, parasite, or small Asian that entered my system seems to have left, and after 13 hours sleep, I'm a new woman. As I return home in a mere 7 days, I have much to do and much to buy. Today, I made up for lost time. After breakfast, which I was delightedly able to keep down, we hit the Silk Market. There is no silk at the Silk Market, but there is fake silk, and fake everything else. As told by Jason the flight attendant, this is the place to buy North Face. So I did. Alex picked up some Lacoste and Adidas, and I must say, is quite good at bargaining. The student, it seems, has become the master. We ran into another family, much like ours, and both moms comisserated at how their sons love to haggle. Often on these trips, I spot families just like ours. They're always from a coast, the dad is always carrying a International Herald Tribune, the mom has expensive walking shoes, tons of maps and travel books, and a good, non-designer bag, and the kids give us knowing looks. Many of my friends find it bizarre that my family takes a big trip together every year, but we're not alone. I remember at 17, we went on a European cruise up to Russia and through Northern Europe, and I met MacKenzie, a 20 year old from Greenwich, CT travelling with his family and 16 year old sister. "Ah", he said when he saw me, "Travelling with the family on a non-optional world tour? Let me charge you a drink." We spent an all nighter in the bar, trading war stories of the bathrooms at the Louvre and pickpockets in Rome. That night, he taught me how to order champagne as we toasted our travels. When we left ship, he found me and said, "Hey Beth. Maybe I'll see you at the piramids, next time." One can only dream. After shopping at the knock-off extravaganze, we hit the Ghost Market. Possibly the most famous market in China, this was unlike anything I've ever heard of. Covered stalls filled with painted human skulls, revolutionary memoribillia, Tibetian jewelry, caligraphy brushes, and tons of old anitiques were packed with locals and tourists alike. I found a little shop along the side selling amazing black and white photography. In a bin in the corner was a pile of old, rejected photos. I pulled up a stool and spent 30 minutes shuffling through them, pulling the ones I liked. My uncle Ted, a frequent commenter here on the blog, is a photographer who would have died upon entry into this place. It became inperative that I find him something. For mere pennies, I walked away with a handful of old photos and the undying love of the girl running the shop. Amidst the stalls, I found incredible, old jewelry and accessories. I bought some silver and jade earrings for Mercedes and tried to talk dad into buying me a vintage cello. No luck, although he promised to buy me a silk lamp in Hong Kong if I carried it on the plane. Gladly. This was his way of getting out of buying me a real Cartier watch, as my fake one tragically passed away. To his dismay, there's actually a Cartier boutique in our lobby, and I found it a sign that I was meant to have one. Apparently not. Mom and dad headed off to explore some palace and architectural feat of genius, as Alex and opted to cab it back to the hotel and order room service burgers. Ah, civilization. Tonight, we're off to some fancy French joint, and bright and early tomorrow, we leave for Guilin. I have no idea about this Guilin place, but we're only there for two days to see the Li River and some random caves, and then it's off to Hong Kong. I can't wait to get to HK, as I consider it an international mecca. All things cool are in Hong Kong, as well as more knock-off markets. And I can stock up there, as our flight home has no baggage weight limitations. Although, all you boys that have requested Rolex's, keep in mind my prinstinely maintained Cartier lasted a week. I make no promises that your watches will survive the flight. I shall do my best, however. Though should I get arrested at customs, you'll have to bail me out. I'm off to check out the pool, hoping to spot my Japanese rock star friend and make actual contact. He sat near us at breakfast this moring, listening to an MP3 player and bobbing his head like he actually understood the gangsta rap I'm positive he was listening to. Oh, you crazy foreigners. I've become an expert at hotel gossip, and have befriended many employees in my need to be nosy. Being so far away from home, I have no idea what's going on with my friends. I'm desperate for info and must resort to spying on Australian tourists and Japanese rockstars. It's midnight on Saturday in San Francisco. I know you guys are out partying without me and it's driving me nuts. If there's anything I hate more than food-poisoning, it's being out of the loop. Send me e-mail gossip immediately. As an aside, my brilliant and gifted friend Jesse just updated her website. Check it out and buy everything.  urlLink www.thejessebcollection.com  Props to her and Zoe for sending me updates and headlines. I'm assuming I can update from Guilin, but as no one's ever heard of this place, who knows. We shall soon see.

      And I'm not talking about that wimpy, Westernized, once I had old salad dressing food poisoning. I'm talking the Third World, SARS based, internal organs imploding, wish you were dead kind. After dinner, at a seemingly safe restaurant last night, I decided to forgo a romp through town with my family and hit the hay. After all, we were hiking The Great Wall the next day and I wanted to be well-rested. At 1am, I shot out of bed. Pain emminated though my entire body and I immediately got violently ill. Violently. I can not express to you the ammount of pain I was in last night. I can only imagine what it's like to give birth, and this was significantly worse. By 3am, I was convinced it was a tapeworm or something equally gross and tropical. By 3:30, I was ready to call an ambulance. By 4, I had to wake Alex up, really just because I was beginning to think something was seriously, seriously wrong and I needed a second opinion. After watching me writhe in pain for a half hour, he went over to mom and dad's and explained the situation. Mother, who, as I've said many times before, isn't really the mothering type, found me curled up in the fetal position crying hysterically. She crawled in bed with me, sent Alex to sleep in her room, and literally rubbed my back until 7:30, when it became clear I had to make a descision about how I was going to spend the day. As I could barely stand, getting dressed proved complicated, but I made my way down to the dining room. 3 bites of yogurt and I immediately ran for the bathroom and lost it all. Back at the table, and in so much pain I found it hard to not scream, I ran out into the lobby sobbing and cluthing my stomach. Standing alone in a corridor, close to death, I couldn't believe my luck. Today, of all days, when I'm supposed to knock off my 3rd wonder of the world, I get sick. And my family was trapped, as they were terrified to leave me alone, yet really fucking wanted to see The Great Wall in China. Another wave of pain shot through my stomach as I collapsed onto the marble floor in tears. I looked up to find the Japanese rock star standing over me, silently staring. Upstairs, I found mom and admitted I might need to see a doctor. In goddamn Beijing. This terrified all of us, and mom decided to go talk to our guide, Annie, patiently waiting for us in the lobby. It was agreed that Annie, dad, and Alex would go find some kind of medicine and mom would stay with me. In the hotel room, I curled up on the bed and screamed into a pillow, half from the pain and half from the frustration. The boys soon returned with a curious concoction that smelled like mint and they instructed me to drink it. I did, and and attempted to lie back down. 30 minutes later, with it made perfectly clear that this was our only opportunity, probably in any of our lives, to see the Great Wall of China, I decided to go. In retrospect, probably not the wisest choice, but one I had to make. I looked up and said, "Let's just get this goddamn wall over with." It was agreed. It took an hour to get out into the country, and as we pulled up to a parking lot, I saw no wall. "Oh no." says Annie. "First we learn about jade." Fabulous. Another attempt at forcing us to buy crap. I was still finding hard to stand upright, must less feign interest in the jade making process, and mom hustled us out of there. Next, were the Ming Dynasty tombs. I'm sure they were very interesting, but I spent that time on a bench with my head in my lap. I ran to the bathroom as another wave of hell consumed by body but found that the toilets were merely holes in the ground with no toilet paper. Dying or not, I couldn't do it. I'm Beth Spotswood. I've never peed in a hole in the ground and it's a record I intend to keep. Lunch followed, at some government run place that serves you food as rapidly as possible, and then you're supposed to shop in their wherehouse of Chinese crap afterward. Our dining table with filled with plates and plates of fabulous food, yet all I could get down was 3 bites of plain rice and some Hot and Sour soup. After lunch, mom piped up, "Let's go buy you some silk jackets!" It was so bad, I didn't even want to shop. I went outside and sat in the sun. Finally, around 2, it was time to head over to The Great Wall. I must admit, it's impressive. Packed with tourists, it climbs thousands of miles into the hills and looks exactly like it's supposed to look. I made it 100 yards, sent my family off, and sat in a corner. Hours later, they descended, drenched and ready to collapse. I was finally starting to feel somewhat better, as we piled in the van with Annie and headed back to the hotel. I slept the entire way home, and now can aknowledge I'm about 75% better. My stomach can still be heard across the room, I'm dehydrated and red eyed, and frustrated as all get out, but it appears I'll live. Considering I wasn't so sure about that a few hours ago, I'm delighted. No one can determine where I contracted this dreaded parasite, although theories include that I drank the water you're not supposed to drink or had too many Chinese Pringles. I think I was the jackass that ate a piece of undercooked meat last night, and hopefully, 24 hours and wierd Chinese medicine will cure me of my malady. Tomorrow, thank god, it's shopping around town at will. I must say, when faced with the prospect of death versus having an ambulance pull up to the Penninsula Hotel and cart you off to some delapidated hospital, I pretty much risked death. After all that, I saw The Goddamn Great Wall of China. And like a Mongolian, nearly died on it.

      Both yesterday and today, I passed a shop called, "That Person is Accustomed to the Clothing." I wonder if it was the same shop, or if it's like the Chinese Gap. KFC is huge here, and while I barely believe my eyes, they've Asian-ized the Colonel. Literally. That picture of him that's all over KFC looks like the dad in The Joy Luck Club. Today, after breakfast, Annie picked us up for a huge day of touring Beijing. I'm actually starting to like her more, as she's pretty laid back and seems to cling to me. She's 28 and very curious about California. First, we hit the Temple of Heaven, which is where the emperor prayed twice a year to his father, the ruler of Heaven. Mom found this very confusing. "I thought he was Buddhist? Is he praying to his biological father? I don't understand." Hello? He's the emperor. Regular religion doesn't really apply here. I mean, he thinks he used to be a fucking dragon. Don't question. Just accept. This is also where they used to sacrafice little six year old boys and girls, calling them golden dragon (boys) and jade pheonix (girls). Cozy. Then, we drove to Tien'amien Square, which was packed with 68 billion people all trying to sell us crap. We could have waited in line for 4 hours to see the actual dead body of Chairman Mao, but thought better it. We walked over the The Forbidden Palace, essentially across the street from the square, and walked the entire length, about 2 miles. The Forbidden Palace is very recognizable, as it's in a milion movies and has that big portrait of Mao at the front gate. It's 650 years old and was only opened to the public in 1928. I found all the concubine stuff the most interesting, as they were sent away to a seperate palace once they turned 40 and were never heard from again. Kind of like a Chinese Menuedo. Everything here is symbolic, from the roof tiles to the inlaid floor. You start to block it out after awhile, as really, who cares. It's all pretty and obviously has some long story. With so many tourists pushing and shoving, I really just wanted to get out of the way and breathe. After lunch, we toured the Summer Palace, where the emperor spent April thru October. It's huge, of course, and has a monstrous lake in the middle. Many, many tourists were fascinated with us and wanted to have their pictures taken with the Americans. I was delighted to oblidge. Annie said they'd never seen a live Barbie doll before. I knew I liked her. Apparently, they see very few Westerners, and we really look American. We're constantly stared at, and have taken to staring back. Many of them point out my long neck, often touching it and then errupting into laughter. Um, get your fucking hands off my neck, Ming Lao. The most interesting part of the Summer Palace was hearing about The Dragon Lady, the Last Emperor's mom. Also known as the Dowager Empress, she was a hardcore bitch who loved to inflict pain and suffering upon those she hated. Her husband, who I'd imagine to be the 2nd to last Emperor, had a favorite concubine, who sang and danced beautifully. The Dragon Lady was, of course, horrible jealous of her and the day after the emperor died, she had the concubine's arms and legs chopped off. The concubine, still alive mind you, was then put on display in a huge glass jar. Annie told us that as a child, her grammar school class got to camp out at the Summer Palace. "Golly." I said, "I'd be afraid of the Dragon Lady's ghost." "Oh yes. We sit around and tell all scary stories of Dragon Lady chop up people." This is the kind of stuff I love. I could just imagine the Dragon Lady, bitter and bitchy, with her 2 favorite eunichs who did her hair (queens), parading around her summer palace chopping people up. That's so much more interesting than hearing about why the roof is yellow and dragon's paws point east. Finally, we hit the Pearl Market, where you can apparently get great deals on really good pearls. I don't want to give anything away, but I'm a fucking awesome roommate. Tomorrow we walk the Great Wall, although hopefully not all 3700 miles. I'm actually pretty excited to see it, just because it's the fucking Great Wall of China, built to keep out the Mongolians. All I know of the Great Wall is really what I've seen on that episode of South Park (Damn you Mongorians!) and that it's the only man made object you can see from space. None the less, it's on Dad's list of 1000 things to see and do before you die. As I'm staying in room 666, it's good I'm knocking a lot off the list.

      Where do these smells come from? Every day, I'm bombarded with an ancient blend of aromas that shock my system and make my eyes water. I can't figure it out. The Chinese have a very different sense of what tastes and smells good or bad. Desserts are uber-sweet and covered in pastel crap. Beef is always hot pink and oddly flavored. Yesterday, I detected hints of lime popscicle flavor in my stir-fry. We took a cab over to Lotus Lane last night. Lotus Lane, recommended by the concierge, is kinda like Epcot Center's China. There's a big lake in the middle, with all kinds of paddle boats you can rent, and then a promenade around the lake packed with super trendy bars and restaurants, where waiters wear Dolce and Gabbana sarongs with sequined tops and faux-hawks. We seemed to find the only legitimate Chinese restaurant, where dad ordered his standard bottle of red and bottle of white. We each picked 2 things off the menu and the table was soon packed with a wide array of unrecognizable food. I wasn't in a drinking mood, still exhausted and nauseous from my day of hell. That however, didn't stop anyone else. There we sat, along Lotus Lane, overlooking a lovely little lake and sparkely lights, and mom, dad, and Alex were getting trashed. Through the eyes of sobriety, I observed my family and came to the following conclusion: The reason I'm nuts is because these people are nuts. My father insisted upon finishing both bottles as a matter of national pride. My brother and mother seemed to have cause-less giggles, particlarly my mother who gets louder and louder with each sip of Chardonnay. Alex, when drunk, apparently spills food all over himself. I practically had to carry the 3 of them to the cabs waiting at the gates of Lotus Lane. I crawled in the front, and packed the AA meeting in the back, where my then father lost it. He literally couldn't breathe, he was laughing so hard. At what, you ask? He saw a Kentucky Fried Chicken tram carrying around Japanese tourits and I said, "Look. It's the KFC zoo-tram." I think he peed his pants. And when my dad laughs that hard, he makes no noise. He just turns red, shakes, and slaps himself, which of course, makes everyone else start laughing. At one point, he and Alex started to wrestle. My mother, ever the voice of intellectual observation, looks out the window to the packed streets of Beijing and says, "If they have that birth control law, why do they keep multiplying like rabbits?" For all that food, booze, and fun, dinner cost $40 US. They're practically giving it away. (Oh wait. Fight in the Business Center. I must eavesdrop.....Oh dear. A very well-dressed American woman's credit card was denied and she's livid. Fabulous. Speaking of which, there's a Japanese rock star staying on our floor, and he looks like a sketch from Saturday Night Live.) Today, Annie is picking us up and we're exploring the Forbidden City. Now, as I generally love to see places that have been in movies, I'm pretty excited, save the fact that it will take all day and I'll probably be ready to shop by 11am. Also, watching my mother try to converse with someone that speaks relatively good English is upsetting. It's like she thinks their deaf AND retarded. Lots of thumbs-ups and similar. It's hard to watch. I'm off to breakfast. Maybe, I'll sit next to the Japanese rock star and he'll hire me to style his upcoming tour. Although, he's gonna need to lose that Catwoman look.

      We are now in Beijing, at The Penninsula Palace Hotel, and Alex and I are in room 666. Seriously. I'm not kidding. Not only that, but mom and dad are next door, which I generally hate as I'd prefer the annonymity of being on a different floor, but their room isn't even ready yet. At 4 fucking pm. Thus, we're all crammed in room 666 exhausted, cranky, and dreaming of The St. Regis. I had to get out. So I came to The Business Center. At least I know when to separate myself. Everyone is driving me nuts. My mother referred to John Mak-lo-vitch and I was ready to stab her with my complimentary pen. My father, assuming all things are foriegn and different in China, couldn't figure out how to twist the top off a bottle of Evian. Literally. I'm ready to kill these idiots that created me. Yes, yes, I know they're wonderful parents who, as my grandmother puts it, whisk me all over the world. But this is the part of family vacations I dread. I'm 26. Having dinner at my parent's house requires that I bite my tounge every 15 minutes. We're on Day 6 of being stuck with each other, it's hot as a mother-fucker, and the sound of my family's voices is making my ears bleed. I keep listening to my CD player spinning "Shut up" by The Black Eyed Peas, just watching their lips move. We took off from Shanghai in a typhoon, and of course, it's pouring rain in Beijing. It was so hot and humid on the fucking 1970's East China Airlines plane that you coulda steamed rice. Annie, our scantilly clad guide here, informed us to have a big breakfast as we're walking everywhere tomorrow, about 7 miles, and we won't get back to the hotel till, like 6. Thus far, our schedule has been doing our own thing in the moring (my thing being shopping) and then returning to the hotel in the early afternoon for spa treatments or similar. 8:30-6 hiking all over town with the broken english bombshell is not what I had in mind.  This is what it's like travelling with me. I'm in such a shitty mood, I'm ready to kill the Mid-western idiot at the compter next to me. My god, who are these people? I get that this is an incredible experience, that I'm seeing things most people never have the opportunity to see. But think of all the places you want to go, then imagine going there with both of your parents. It gets hard. Really hard. And suddenly, your mother says Maklovitch and you're ready to fly home. Fucking Maklovitch. Are you kidding me?  My CD player has become my therapy. I block everyone out with my constant replaying of the same songs. Every trip, I bring a million CD's, but only end up listening to 3 of them, obsessed with hearing the same thing over and over. I can't explain it. This trip, it's the entire Scissor Sisters CD, minus the last song, The Last Emperor Soundtrack, and Gavin DeGraw singing a cover of "Against All Odds" which breaks my heart everytime I hear it. The only thing that has the ability to put me in an instant good mood is "Filthy/Gorgeous" by The Scissor Sisters, as I've envisioned an entire video starring me, which I performed for Alex last night. It involves me crushing martini glasses with my fabulous Manolo's on the bar at The Redwood Room. I just called Alex up in the room, who informed me that it's safe to come up. The folks have now moved next door, to room 668. As he's saying this, however, I hear in the background, "Hey Alex, how do you work the lights?"  Ahhhhhhhhhhh!

      Mom lost the digital camera. The one with all the pictures of me dancing with the old man. The one with basically all of Shanghai on it. The one she wouldn't let anyone else carry. Well, it's an excuse to buy a super fancy new one here, and at least it didn't happen at the end of the trip, but it fucking sucks ass. She left it in a cab, of course, and the amazing staff here have made every effort to track down her driver, even reviewing the security footage from the front door, which they found. No one could read the liscence plate, though, and thus, the camera is gone. We'll get over it, and mom's taking it the hardest. Ah well. Yesterday, we hit the insect and fish market. It was bizarre, made up of a serious of intensly smelly alleys. Crickets and bugs and millions of turtles, all within this little residential ghetto. I took a million National Geographic-esque pictures if Chinese children in doorways, and old men asleep on rickshaws, but I'll have to describe them to you. (Okay. Still a little pissed about the camera.) Afterwards, I needed some alone time, so I went off to the fancy mall section of town. An expert shopper in the States, the malls here are pretty similar, and I felt suddenly at home. Many of the stores are the same, and many, many are different. There was a store called 45 Surftime USA, which was the Chinese attempt at Pacific Sunwear. I poked around, and when I told the staff I was from California, they went nuts. "Oh, Hollywood! Surf and Turf! Hang ten, posse!" Um, yeah. That's exactly what it's like. The one thing that IS exactly the same here as it is at home is Starbucks, right to the chalk board behind the counter. I got a Frappuchino and secretly and silently thanked mass globalization. When traveling in such a different country, you do get this global perspective you'd never get reading and book or watching some documentary. But you also get culture shocked. At some point, and I hit that point yesterday, the communication barriers, the heat, the wierd food, the lack of tact, the pushy packed sidewalks...it all gets to you. But, I guess that's the point. I came back to the hotel and watched Sparticus on HBO. Before dinner, we ALL needed a drink, and went to the bar on the top floor. They have a lovely little appetizer spread and free booze and we got quite comfortable. For dinner, we hit 1221, a trendy Chinese restaurant favored by ex-patriots. This seemed good, because the food here really is different. And, not in a good way. 1221 has Chinese food like you and I think of Chinese food. It rocked, we went through 2 bottles of wine, and I think I agreed to produce dad's election night show. After dinner, mom and Alex hit the sack, but dad and I hit the Mezz Lounge and had some Santori. I passed out (literally) at midnight, and awoke hungover and hideous at 6am. I gotta say, when dad decides to toe one on, it's hard to keep up. But overhwlmingly entertaining. As we got on the elevator, he says, "Well Bethy. Those are all my secrets." Wait. I've already forgotten all the good gossip he just told me. Fuck! We're off to Beijing this morning. I'm a little sketchy about this flying domestically in China, for two reasons. One, the bag weight limitations are fierce, and I've, of course, purchased half of Shanghai, and Two, This is a 3rd World country. I'm not so familliar with their pilot training. Well, if I die, I die. But at least I'll be wearing Cartier. (Which is still ticking....mom predicts it'll be dead by Honk Kong. Whatever. This from the woman that bought fake Louis Vuitton sunglasses...) Beijing...Interesting. Here's to hoping there's an uprising. Maybe, I'll start one!

      Oh my god. Where to begin? First of all, normally, I write in the afternoon, but last night was so nuts and I was wide awake at 5:30, that I had to get it all down now. Alex and I decide to come down to the hotel bar early and have a drink. We've been doing this every night and we love the staff at Mezz, the mellow jazz bar on the 2nd floor. We've become kinda palsy with the staff and no longer have to order. They simply bring us our wine and beer. John, the waiter there, keeps telling Alex, "You sister so beautiful. I no pay attention to you." "Perhaps you two would like to be alone?" jokes Alex. I think John took it a little too seriously. Soon dad showed up and we were off. Dressed to the nines, we took a cab to dinner at M on the Bund, kind of a cross between Postrio and a W Hotel restaurant. It was super trendy and right up my alley. Mom wanted to see some more pictures on the walls and huge floral arrangements, but it's the kind of place I'd hang out in if I lived here. Dinner was extraordinary, literally. The food was flawless Mediterranian fusion and we were all in heaven. Immediately after dinner, we had to run over to the Peace Hotel, as we had reservations to hear some jazz. Now, if you'll recall, this was MY idea. I love Jazz clubs and envisioned some sort of 1930's dimly lit Chinese version of the Cotton Club. As if walking the 5 jam-packed blocks in gold stilettos weren't traumatic enough, a block away I ran into an old, depressing beggar. As I tried to walk around him, he reached for my handbag, which I held in the air. Being about a foot taller than him, the clutch was perfectly safe. I, however, was not, as he then grabbed me around the waist and basically tried to rip me apart. I screamed bloody murder, mom kicked his cane, and we ran across the street clutching each other and desperate to find dad and Alex, who seemed to be lost in the crowd. They, of course, missed all of this and when told, didn't really care. Nice. Shaking, I drag everyone into the Peace Hotel, which looks significantly tackier and cheaper than described, and inquired as to the jazz. Pointed in the right direction, we follow the "music" and enter what appears to be a poorly decorated beer hall filled with tank topped Germans and Koreans who have their picture taken with their waiters. A band made up of 90 year old Chinese men plays "In The Mood", as we check in and our shown to our table, front and center. First of all, I feel like an idiot walking in there dressed so fabulously. But, that was the least of our problems. Just as we sit down, a dreadful, middle aged, Maitre'd appears out of nowhere and screams, "No. You no sit here. Table reserved. You move. Come with me." "Wait." We say. "What are you talking about? That woman sat us here. We made reservations." "No, table broken. You sit here." He motions miles away, to the back of the cellar. I think I saw a rat scurry across the floor as I get in his face and say, "Go talk to that woman. We made a reservation. " He runs off to the front desk and returns. "Me so sorry. You go back and sit." Like assholes, we walk in front of the band again and sit back at the origional table. All a little wierded out, especially as this huge scene was made about us, we attempt to order drinks. As they have no wine by the glass and I'm pissed, I have an Evian. Dad attempts to order a Santori, because, "for relaxing times, make it Santori time", but is brought a Gin and Tonic instead. The music is dreadful, compounded by the fact that they have a laminated set list on the table. Songs include, "Denny Boy" and "My Heart Left in San Francisco." Typos aside, other songs consisted of favorites like "La Cucaracha" and and "Mambo #5". "This isn't jazz." whispers Alex. No fucking shit. The trumpet punctures my eardrum, and we agree to down our drinks and get the fuck out of there. In the cab, we all decide we need a real drink, and Alex and I insist we go to Mezz. John is delighted to see us, and immediately brings Alex's beer and my wine. Dad gets his Santori and mom, needless to say, has Chardonnay. We're having a lovely time, listening to real jazz, when John nervously comes up to the table. "You such nice family. It so good to see you and serve you. I want to give you special gift." He's holding a red velvet box, with gold embroidery on top saying, "St. Regis. Shanghai." "I present to you." he states looking at me, and he hands me the box. On the spot, with Alex stiffling hysterics, I open said box to reveal gorgeous chocolate truffles. "Oh, John. That's so sweet. You're so nice. How lovely." He kind of smiles, and then sprints away. My family can barely stand it, they find this so funny, but I dive into my chocolates and curse the Peace Hotel. The Mezz Lounge is awesome. When we finish our drinks, John returns again. "You from America, yes? You know the television, uh, Growing Pains?" And then, the most fabulous event occurred. He pumps his fist and screams, "Michael Seaver!" Seriously. That's brilliant. Alex goes, "You know Boner?" "Oh Boner! I like Boner." We laugh, get up to leave, and say, we'll be back tomorrow. "Oh no. I no here tomorrow. So sad. I no see you." Dad shakes his hand, which sends him into bliss, and I consider hugging him. Rethinking that maybe that's not the best idea, I thank him profusly and leave. I think it's safe to say, drop my name at the Mezz lounge, and they'll take care of you.

      Last night, we went to this restaurant recommended by the conceierge, serving traditional Shanghai and Hongzou food which is supposed to be fabulous. Upon arrival, we were greeted by 5 (yep, 5) yellow clad greeters, all of whom said, "Good morning." Each of us selected some menu items, and when the head waiter was sent over, he informed us that we wouldn't like several of them, and thus, insisted we order something else. "You no like. You Westerner. It too different for you." Whatever. When I attempted to order a glass of wine, I was told wine was only available by the bottle. Fine. Am I allowed to have a fucking bottle? Indeed I am. Within 20 minutes, dinner was fabulous and hilarious, and we all stumbled over to see the acrobats. It was actually pretty entertaining, with lots of plate spinning and tiny girls who could do the unspeakable with thier bodies. Mother sat next to some people from Indianapolis, and afterwards, when asked about her chat with them, she replied, "They're the reason George Bush is going to win." This morning, I can tell you, was one of the most incredible mornings of my life. Alex and I got up early, and were in the gym by 7. By 8:30, we were gloriously fed and in a cab on our way to some park. Mom and Dad's best friends, Dori and Greg, spent 3 weeks in Shanghai last year, and insisted we get to this park before 9. Apparently, all kinds of older Chinese people do tai chi and ballroom dancing and singing in the park every morning. I sounded interesting enough, so off we went. Immediately, we could tell this place was awesome. It's a huge square park, and there were 20 or so groups of people, all doing different things. One group was made up of 15 older women, all dancing in unison with fans, another group danced with swords. 70 people, arranged by height, sang all kinds of folk songs. Everyone seemed to have a little go cart with a tape player attached, knocking out the background music. We couldn't stop taking photos, as everything looked like it was right out of a PBS documentary. Towards the far end of the park, there were maybe 50 couples, all doing ballroom dancing to a go-cart boom box. A huge crowd of locals surrounded them, and they were clearly the biggest group at the park. All of a sudden, as I stood taking pictures, an old little Chinese man comes up and motions for me to dance with him. "Oh no, I'm no good." Mom pushed me forward, and the next thing I know, I'm ballroom dancing with this guy, and a bunch of other couples. The locals find this hilarious, as does, needless to say, the rest of my family. The song was long, and our dance kicked ass. This guy, while having 3 teeth, was pretty good, and twirled and dipped me for what seemed like an eternity. It was adorable, and the entire time, I kept thinking, "I'm in mother-fucking Shanghai dancing with some old, toothless Fred Astaire in a public park at 9am." The song ended, the crowd errupted into laughter and applause, my dance partner and I hugged and bowed to each other, and off I went. It was incredible, unexpected, and awesome. We explored the rest of the park, watched some old people playing cards and spitting, and headed off to see some tea garden in another section of town. Not before, of course, dad bought himself a can of beer. You can all call me an alcoholic as much as you want, but Dick Spotswood downed a Tsing Tao before 10am, and I've got a picture of it. I bought a can of something called "Hey Song Sasparilla" which will travel the world with me and don my mantle when I get home. The tea garden was interesting, really because our cab got pulled over and we had to deal with the fucking Commie police. The dude was a complete asshole and we took pictures this dreaded fuzz while giving him dirty looks. After lunch, mom, Alex and I went to the antique market and got all kinds of old crap. Because I am the greatest fag hag in the world, I bought Andy a 1930's opium pipe which may or may not get through customs. I didn't score any opium, but I think we can figure out a way to make it work. I also purchased a Chairman Mao poster, army bag, and musical lighter, while Alex got a fake Rolex for his best friend. All in all, a beyond successful day. Tonight, it's dinner at some fancy place called "M on the Bund", and then 1930's jazz at the Peace Hotel, apparently famous for it's jazz. This is the one place I've picked to go to, so I hope it works out. You never know, though. The things you think will be awesome often suck, and then you show up at some public park at the break of dawn and end up dancing the morning away with a charming, toothless Asian man. Ah, travel...

      Today, in addition to experiencing Chinese culture and shit, I bought 2 Tiffany bracelets, 1 Tiffany necklace, 2 North Face backpacks, Channel and Ray Ban sunglasses, and a Cartier watch, all for about $60, US. Although, it nearly came to fistacuffs several times. These people didn't know who they were dealing with. I'm no yokle tourist. I've haggled all over the world, I can haggle here. "Hey pretty lady. You want Burberry? You like Channel? Vuitton? Yes, you like. You name me good price." They grab arms and pull on bags. It's intense. Then, they pull out a calculator and type in a price. Next, I grab the calculator and cut the price in half. This continues until I pretend to walk away, and suddenly, everything's practically free. They catch on quick, listening to us talk, and then yelling, "Hey Alex. You like North Face? Alex? Alex, you want Tag Hauer? You like Gucci?" Incredible. This exists in every major city here, and apparently, they crack down at the airports. Fools. I'm shipping it all back. This is glorious. Long Live China! Tonight, it's acrobats. Maybe, they'll pull Alex onstage. For now, Alex is getting some aromatherapy massage and I'm about to go read my scary books. Maybe, I'll have some tea sent up. Whenever you run into any staff here, it's "Good day, madam." "It is my pleasure, madam." Make eye contact and it's, "What can I get you, madam?" Nothing. I'm in the elevator. I hope I'm not being racist, as these people are Chinese, not Japanese, but I find myself bowing a lot. Ah well. Me foreign tourist. No know culture in China. Me learn to say words. Actually, all I ever say is shei shei, which is Thank You. And then, I bow.

      With 17 million people, Shanghai is twice the size of New York City. Needless to say, today I got lost. We had dinner last night at The Grand Hyatt, on the 55th floor overlooking some huge, lit, globe representing some Olympics of the future. I was so exhausted, I don't even remember getting back to our hotel. We passed out around 11, and Alex and I awoke easilly at 5:30 this moring. Wide awake and rarin' to go, I decided to work out as soon as the gym opened at 6am, and then swam 25 laps. By 7:30, we went to the huge breakfast buffet here and gorged ourselves until it was time to meet up with mom, dad, Rei the guide, and her nameless driver, in the lobby. I saw all kinds of Chinese people having chow mein and beef stir fry for breakfast. I had a croissant, scrambled eggs, bacon, fruit, and the greastest cup of coffee ever made. Rei took us first to the older part of town where it looks very imperialistic and British, but with bicycles and rickshaws everywhere. We toured a small museum there, and everyone stared at us. Then, she took us to this school in an old brick building, where we actually sat in on classes filled with 6 year olds. Literally, the 4 of us found ourselves in tiny classrooms, with little kids instructed to perform for us. An entire class sang us two songs, then a room full of tiny little ballerinas did a fabulous interpretive dance for us. We saw calligraphy and art classes as well. It was awesome. We just walked in and interupted their classes, and they acted like this was the most normal thing in the world. As we left each class, they all said in unison, "Nice to make your aquaintance!" Upon departure from the school, the teachers kind of rangle you into an office/giftshop where they encourage you to support the school by buying crap. So we did. Mother was desperate to go to some Jesuit cathedral, because apparently every catholic cathedral in Europe in't enough for her. Poor Rei took us there, as I asked her to describe Buddhism. Hello, Joanne. If we're going to hit the churches, as you insist on doing in every foreign country, maybe we should check out a temple. I think I've got this Christianity thing down. Then, Rei drags us to this rug factory, which everyone else claimed to be fascinated by, but I found boring. Plus, they practically force you to buy rugs, which we didn't. Please let it be time for lunch. It was. Rei informs us that we'll be having Mongolian BBQ, and it was totally bizarre. This place is hugely touristy, as we were 4 of many "roundeyes" in there. The deal is this: you grab a bowl, then fill it with an assortment of raw meat, vegetables, and various sauces. You bring it to a window, and some dude throws it on a flaming metal disk. Once it's cooked, he throws it back in your bowl, and badda bing, stir. They also had a salad bar, where the two salad dressings available were ketchup and "Egg Mayonaise". Thank you, no. It's at this point that I start to feel violently ill. Mom and I go to the ladies, where we discover that you flush the toilet by pulling an old rope attached to the base. The women next to us spoke in German, the only word of which I understood was SARS. After lunch, Rei decided we'd hit The Shanghai Museum of Art, which is pretty interesting. I'm very into the furniture and the clothing. They had jade bracelets from 37BC and Tibetian prayer robes that blew my mind. But, as I still felt like ass, I told mom I was cabbing it back to the hotel and split. My big plan to get back here was to take a postcard of the hotel and show it to the driver. In China, you sit in the front seat of the cab, and as no one speaks any English, must find ways to explain where you're going in a city this fucking huge. He seemed to understand the postcard. Turns out, not so much. Thru tunnels and over bridges, through the ghettos of Shanghai and the highrise, tacky apartment complexes, we drove and drove, nearly killing many along the way. 25 minutes into the ride, I pull out the postcard again. I point to the chinese writing at the bottom. The driver gets a look of horror on his face, as he flips the car around and hightails it in the opposite direction. An hour later, here I am. The cab ride cost me 3 bucks. Not bad. And I've seen more of Shanghai than the cast of the Joy Luck Club. I've got to say, for as jet lagged and food poisoned as I am, this is one of the most fascinating and different places I've ever seen. It's extraordinary the number of people and the level of culture. I feel that we, as Americans, are nothing but cultureless cowboys. Everything looks different, from the cars (today, I drove in a VW "Santana") to the buildings, which range from old Chinese structures with ducks and wet clothes in the window, to Vegas-like monstrosities with orbes and flashing lights. For a Communist country, there's a huge difference between the rich and the poor, which I don't really get. I'm kinda chicken to ask Rei pointed questions, although mom had no problem pointing out to the rug factory guy that since he had one son and no daughters, he must be delighted. "Don't you people prefer boy babies?" Nice. We have our own private butler named Ken, and I'm about to go upstairs and ask him to send my clothes to laundry and bring me some tea. I wonder if Ken can handle me sending underwear to be washed? There's only one way to find out. I think it's interesting that we come all the way to China to a hotel that gives you butlers, and his name is Ken. I asked mom and dad if their butler was named Troy. Mom didn't get it. Tonight, it's the 1930's jazz club at the Peace Hotel, I think. At least, that's my vote. For now, it's to tea and then, to sleep. I hope this blog thing works from here. E-mail me and let me know. Sheshe. (That's thank you.) PS. Today, at lunch, my dad goes, "You know who'd love this? Bonnie." Um, yeah dad. She would. Bon, hop a flight. Dick feels like buying you a Chinese beer.

      Here I am in gorgeous Shanghai. This is fucking awesome. But first things first. ...and now, a minute by minute account of the past 14 hours of my life... At check in, we were told that the probability of Alex and my being upgraded was high. We were instructed to wait to board, and if spaces were still available in Business Class, we'd get them. Long story short; they weren't. We angrilly flew coach and I decided to entertain myself by detailing the hell I knew I was about to endure. 2:15pm PST, We're scheduled to take off now. Why aren't we? The movies are 50 First Dates, Hidalgo, and Shrek 2. Um, no thanks. 2:45pm, Fuck You United. I'm listening to an electronic device during take off. 3:03pm, Take off 3:15pm, fill out foreign entry cards, befriend gay steward, Jason, whom I now love. 3:25pm, start drinking shitty wine. (Brooks Hollow cabernet. Beware!) I bet they have better wine in Biz. Class. 3:51pm, start to pretend I'm on my own private plane, jetsetting across the globe. Alex wants to know why I'm still wearing sunglasses as I read Elle. 5:30pm, Extreme boredom setting in. Mom stopped by to rub in coach. Mix of Vallium and wine making me begin to cry at Avril Levigne (sp?) song? Worrisome. 6:15pm, I hate all music. I've read my Elle twice and am too antsy to read my book. Sent Dad to get us Biz. Class snacks. Are we there yet? Starting to hate those around me. 6:20pm, Dad brought us cheese and grape plate. Consumed in 2 minutes as we didn't want to get caught with fancy snacks. I wonder what all my friends are doing? 6:31pm, have become fascinated by cheapest pillow in the history of air travel. 6:35pm, I'm starting to hate my outfit. 7:15pm, Dad appears with sandwiches, chips, and Toblerone. Fuckin' Biz Class. 8:00pm, disccovered Chinese man across from Alex reading United's copies of Ebony and Shape En Espanol. Curious. 8:25pm, Jason the steward stopped by with a list of great places in Shanghai and Beijing for pearls, knock offs, and cheap massages. Fabulous. 9:00pm, bizarre snack of Chinese Cuo O' Noodles, mini-apple, and short bread. Gave Alex gross soup. I hope Dad keeps the snack train coming. 9:10pm, forced to tackle stewardess for coffee. I bet they have biscotti in Biz Class. 9:28, Alex is fascinated with woman across from him who keeps staring in his direction. We've decided to actively spy on her and the Ebony guy, who seem to have become friends. Seats 61 H and J. 9:40, addition of coffee to system has me on speed-like high. Convinced I should get a Scissor Sisters logo tattoo somewhere on me. This is the greatest album I've ever heard in my life. 9:43, So Bored and can't see the video screen. 61 H and J are now networking with those around them. 9:50, Fuck Biz Class. Equality, not Economy! 10:00, on a Friday night. I could be at The Redwood Room having not only fun, but sufficient legroom. 10:05, show big map on screen. 4 and a half hours till Shanghai. We're past the international dateline and nearing Japan. Okay. This is cooler than The Redwood Room. 10:59, starting to get noticeably horrible. Craning neck to see Shrek 2. Air conditioning blowing in my face. Been here for 9 hours. Oh god. I actually just drooled on myself. 11:46, nearing Japanese coast. We're going 565 mph. Less than 3 hours left. Dad came by with more provisions from civilization, including cheddar cheese and jelly beans. I feel sick. 12:25amPST, somewhere over Tokyo. Hour 10 of flight. Ready to parachute out of here. 12:26, Why are they showing the safety video again? Getting second wind. 12:32, Second wind gone. 12:40, Alex is asleep with his mouth open and I'm tempted to put things in it. Is physical pain worth a chuckle? Let's see...Yes! It is. I have the hardcore giggles now. Putting pens in Alex's mouth. In hysterics. Alex still asleep. Never been one for such cheesy comedy. Must be delirium. But that doesn't mean I'll stop. Feeling very obnoxious. More so than usual. Must cause trouble. 1:03, did my shower, tooth brush, hair styling, re-make up in the potty. Peeked out window at Japam below. Looks as I remeber it. 1:25, This food is appalling. Some kind of pasta with red sauce, random melon, and shitty cookie. 2:00am PST (5pm Shanghai.) 15 hours ahead. 45 minutes till landing. Oh god. They're about to spray us with bugkiller. Alex is taking pictures. 2:25am, descending! Over East China Sea. I never heard of East China Sea. 15 more minutes! Some one just applied a gallon of cologne. Damn you, Duty Free... 2:40, Alex pipes up, "It looks like rice paddies." All flight attendants congratulating us for surviving coach, especially Jason. Alex wonders aloud how gays always find me immediately. I'm blessed, I guess. 2:45am, (5:45pm Shanghai time) Touchdown. Holy Shit, we're in China. We were met at the airport by Rei, our fabulous little guide. We made it to this gorgeous hotel within and hour of landing and are getting ready to go to the Grand Hyatt's "Canton" for some swanky dinner. It's 5am to me right now. And I'm not that tired. Although a little dazed. But, hells bells, y'all. I made it. Gotta run. I think they're changing me a limb per minute.

      I'm getting excited. In 27 hours, I'll be on a plane bound for Shanghai. Red China. The People's Republic. Oppressors of Tibet. Makers of knock-off designer bags. China. Similar to Home Alone, mom and pop are flying Business Class and Alex and I are waitlisted. If we can't upgrade, we'll fly 12 and a half hours in steerage, with the goats and the chickens. Do they even have seatbelts back there? Although, my beloved sibling pointed out that at least the booze is free on international flights. (He's his mother's son.) I have been an indentured servant to any miles plus program, and have thus been able to upgrade consistently. I think the last time I flew coach, the inflight movie was Dick Tracy. (Speaking of which, as a nerdy aside, did you know that Benicio Del Torro's "Fenster" in The Usual Suspects was an homage to Dustin Hoffman's "Mumbles" in Dick Tracy?) A little business to attend to, as this is my form of communication to everyone I know. 1. Bonnie has our contact info. If someone dies, tell her and she'll tell us. 2. We sent out the Evite for our huge Anniversary Extravaganza. If you read this, you're so invited. Email me and I'll add you to the list. 3. The next time you hear from me, I'll be in China, filling you in on the hilarity, tragedy, and constant fighting that makes up Spotswood Family International Travel. I hope mother packed the Vallium. No one's allowed to have any fun while I'm gone.  Beth Spotswood has left the country...

      ...when Bon and I posted our craigslist ad on Valentine's Day. We were cracking ourselves up last night recalling our adventures, and we are desperate to find that ad. I can't believe we didn't save it. For those of you who don't know the legendary Valentine's Day story of 2004, let me enlighten you. This past Valentine's Day, Bon and I found ourselves home with no dates and nothing to do. This struck us as ridiculous. Seriously. It was a crime. We woke up and wandered around the flat, moaning and bitching about this stupid holiday that no one really likes anyway. Finally, we decided, "Fuck it." Bonnie went into the kitchen to stir up some alcoholic brew at 11am, and I went in my room to create my costume. When I emerged, Bonnie caught on fast and went into her room to change as well. By noon, we were both drunk, wearing pink lingerie, little black cardigans, high heels, with flowers in our hair and crazy make-up. It is at this point, that we decided it'd be a good idea to explain our situation to the world and post an ad on Craigslist. The ad went a little something like this: We're so bored this Valentine's Day that we're....already drunk! We're 2 twenty-something vixens who are baffled by the fact that we don't have dates. Thus, we've dressed up in ridiculous lingerie inspired outfits, inebriated ourselves, and are looking for love in all the wrong places. We look like an episode of Oprah gone awry. The men in the white coats are not far off. Rescue us. B+B We received 132 responses. With 2 computers set up on the sun porch, we set to the task of narrowing our options. Bon created various folders in our joint e-mail account, entitled: Mr. Right, Possibly, Not So Much, Naked Boys, and Never. Needless to say, when you announce that you and your girlfriend are drunk, wearing pink lacey slips, and lookin’ for action, you get a myriad of replies, mostly of the dirty variety. With a mixture of vodka, lemonade, and crushed fresh strawberries (to make it pink, of course), we came to a list of about 5 possibilities, including one guy who just wanted to come over and watch us get ready to go out. He was hot, but creepy. He got moved into the Not So Much category. I spent a bit of time e-mailing back and forth with 2 Australian guys in town to sell copy machine products. They seemed cute, friendly, and funny. We agreed. Australians it would be. Once we decided we were actually going to meet these 2 guys, we got all hysterical and excited. “Oh my god. Are we really doing this?” “Fuck yes, we’re really doing this. Go put on slutty clothes.” We decided to meet them in North Beach, and nervously got in a cab. We were kind of early, so we sat at the bar and drank. Suddenly, in walks this guy that is obviously one of the Australians. He is Kym, and his friend Ben is parking. Ben finally arrives, we all find a table, and start to talk. They’re adorable! They’re nice and funny and not at all gross. They’re incredibly chivalrous, touchy feely, and super cute. Plus, those accents. We hit a few bars before they propose dinner. Um, dinner? Okay. We go to some romantic Italian place and have a marvelous time, with Bonnie and I kicking each other under the table through most of the meal. At around midnight, we head over to Capp’s, and grab some more drinks. By closing time, we’re delightedly drunk and ready to head home. We thank them for a lovely time, kiss them goodbye, hop in a cab, and erupt into hysterics. We could not have had a better time with anyone else. Kym and Ben rock. The next day, the called just to make sure we got home okay. Yeah, guys. We’re really fucking okay. Viva Australia!

      Bon and I just got back from dinner at Foreign Cinema. We split the cheapest bottle of red they had and ended up having an in depth discussing on sex. We were laughing so hard, I think we offended the next table, but screw them. They were French. Our waiter (also French) was a total asshole, and I think he was silently judging us. Whatever. You can take my dirty plate away now, you frog. I returned home to an e-mail from my friend Christine who was worried that there'd be no blog updates while I'm in China. Fear not. It's the land of technology. I'll be filling everyone in on my adventures near daily. I hear they have a wall there. I'll be sure to tell you guys all about it.

      I'm currenly reading 3 books, one of which is an attempt to re-read the origional Les Miserables in French (I'm on page 4). The others are trashy, drugstore novels that cost nickels and I secretly love. Today, upon reading the following passage, I finally decided that I can no longer consider myself an intellectual snob and it turns out, I'm just as stupid as everyone else, if not stupider.  "Fuck English in the ass with a hydrochloric acid dildo. The wave of the future is science."

      Last night, I watched Tom Cruise: Inside the Actor’s Studio. Oh. My. God. What a freak.  Have I told you my theory about huge, international celebrities? I maintain, that once you reach a certain level of celebrity, you begin to lose your gauge of what’s normal and what’s not. So many people fawn over every little thing you say, you can basically do no wrong, and people always laugh at your jokes. You have no gauge of when you’re being funny or not, when you sound smart or not, when you’re making an ass of yourself to us regular people, because you are surrounded (whether you want to be or not) by people who do nothing but kiss your ass. I have 3 excellent examples of this. 1. My friend Lauren is currently an actress in LA. Prior to this, she was an actress in New York. While there, she appeared as slut #2 in a Ricky Martin video. She found herself filming a scene in a nightclub, squished into a booth with Ricky and some other skanks, and having to talk to Ricky in between takes. He spoke of Puerto Rico and his love for water. At one point, a production assistant piped up and said, “Oh Ricky. I love water, too.” Ricky high fives this jackass, and the entire nightclub applauds. 2. While watching a “Making of The Gladiator” on HBO, I observed Russell Crowe (that’d be Oscar winning Russell Crowe) wandering around the set pretending his sword was a penis. This is in the background, while the director is being interviewed. When it’s finally Russell’s turn to be interviewed, he cracks some off-color jokes to the dead silence around him. He then spits, gets up, and walks away. 3. Finally, we come to the great Kevin Spacey, who has so many gauge infractions, I don’t know where to begin. At a televised tribute to the Beatles, he performed “Mind Games” onstage (entirely solo), while sweating and dancing around like a drunk uncle at a wedding. I could see him at some meeting months before, coming up with this grand scheme to show off his skills, and no one, not even his closest advisors, had the balls to say, “Uh, Mr. Spacey. Perhaps that’s not the best idea.” Worse, recently, he was cruising some gay park in London at 4am, let some tweaker steal his cell, called the cops and said he was mugged, and then called back and said, nope, actually I gave some tweaker my phone. I lied before. “Oh, no problem, Mr. Spacey. We all understand. (snicker, snicker.)”  The point is, at a certain level, you can no longer tell what is acceptable behavior and what is not, because you have an entourage of 27 people who give you a standing ovation every time you take a shit. Tom Cruise has reached that point. Last night, on Inside the Actor’s Studio, I became so embarrassed for him, I was forced to change the channel. I took notes. Hold on. I’ll get them. Fist of all, he’s taller than James Lipton, which let’s you know how fucking short Lipton is. Interesting. Tom has trouble answering direct questions. When asked about childhood financial hardships early in the interview, Tom goes off into this diatribe about how those hardships build character and gets all philosophical, to the point of not making sense. Shut up, Tom. We just wanted to hear about how you had to gut fish or clean train station bathrooms. Save the propaganda for the Q&amp;A. And talk about father issues. When asked why he changed his name, he practically hit James Lipton for suggesting he wanted to disassociate himself from his father. After 10 minutes of ass kissing and coddling, Tom says he changed his name because he wanted to disassociate himself from his father. Hello? Every question sent him off into some intense personal place of incoherent justification of god knows what. He rambles and pontificates and never comes to a point. (Yeah, I know, I know. Shut the fuck up.) Of course, they touch on the movies that Tom wants to talk about. Sure, there’s no mention of Losin’ It or All the Right Moves. But no Cocktail? Come on! We spend 45 minutes on Vanilla Sky, and no fucking Cocktail? That’s a bunch of malarkey. The thing is, even though Tom Cruise is practically from another planet, it’s not really his fault. He became a superstar at 21, and as we all know, 21 year old men are very, very stupid. So, people have been telling him he’s a genius since then. Plus, look at him. My god, he’s glowing. They showed all kinds of baby pictures, and Tom was a strikingly good looking toddler. He’s gorgeous, and even though he makes no sense and can barely function, he’s so fucking beautiful, you just smile and nod along with everyone else. Keep talking, pretty boy. We don’t care about what you’re saying, we just want to see those teeth. I would just like to take this opportunity to say that you fine people have no problem telling me when I’m making an ass of myself. When I’m a huge, international celebrity…you can all kiss my ass like crazy. I’m going to dress like a drag queen and publicly sing and pretend my sword is a penis. Why? Because I can, that’s why. Isn’t that the whole point of being famous?

      9:30. A&E. Watch it.  (I'll be having dinner at the Buckeye, which, because it's my favorite restaurant, makes missing this glorious occassion slightly bearable. But, I'm taping it. You all need to be ready to discuss tomorrow.)

      Props to Alice 97.3 for playing "Much too late for goodbyes" by Jullian Lennon. It's been stuck in my head since last night and I'm about to kill myself with a Yamaha keyboard.

      Yesterday, Alex, Kelsey, and I saw The Village. And today, I went to an 11am showing of The Manchurian Candidate. Here’s what I can report: We had heard that the Village is pretty predictable. Everyone always expects M. Night Shyamalan to have some big twisty surprise ending, and he did. Yeah, I called it half way through, but none the less, it was still not horrible. We expected to be scared out of our wits and as we walked into the theater, Kelsey asks the movie staff if the movie is scary. “Oh, not as scary as if I were to rip your head off and drink what’s inside.” Nice. I think I can speak for Kelsey and myself by saying that the highlight of The Village is Joaquin Pheonix. I just want him to come rescue me from perilous situations. He’s dreamy. The Manchurian Candidate sucked. Seriously. I’ve always been a Liev Schreiber fan (see Daytrippers. He’s hilarious.) and I truly worship Meryl Streep. One of my favorite things is seeing a movie alone as early in the day as humanly possible. I have never seen the original, so I had nothing to compare it to. I was in the mood for a good thriller. And Jonathan Demme directed one of the greatest movies ever made, Silence of the Lambs. I was anticipating a solid 2 hours of seriously good film. I was totally let down. Keep in mind, I hate Denzel Washington, based mostly on the fact that he was a dick when I saw him on Charlie Rose. And I’m not a science fiction kind of gal. But this thing was the most anti-climactic experience of my life, and that’s saying something. I want my cash back. I’d rather give it to the hobo so he can buy some tuna.
