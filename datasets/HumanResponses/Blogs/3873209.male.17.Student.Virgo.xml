It's fine if they tell me the do things nicely I'll probably do it... bit damn it... if they use their authoity on me... i get really pissed... Like really pissed... damn it. So freaking pissed.

      ANCON was really good :D learnt alot and had tons of fun :):):) Alysha's missed me? And I'm starting to think pigs might fly too =P aaww shucks yeah I missed u peeps too :') lol though I might have been a tad slack on you this Sat ^^ but hey you started it!! though silliness only goes so far I suppose...   Yep, the song "Your love changes me" has really nice lyrics-you ppl'll have to show me how it sounds sometime-by u 2 singing it would be nice too coz u 2 have nice voices :):)   Somedays I really feel frustrated by my own inability, often hiding behind a mask, sometimes trying to be someone I'm really not-but God knows our hearts, our reasons, our motives. With God, we are laid bare-one of my favourite songs I learnt from ANCON is Rock of Ages, and one of the verses goes    &nbsp;   Nothing in my hand I bring,    Simply to the cross I cling;    Naked, come to Thee for dress;    Helpless, look to Thee for grace;    Foul, I to the fountain fly;    Wash me, Savior, or I die.     &nbsp;  At ANCON one point which really hammered home to me is that we, as Christians, have been called to freedom from sin. But so often, we laden down ourselves with our own guilt rather than accepting that God has given us freedom. The bible teaches us that guilty feelings&nbsp;has no place in Christian life, but instead rather we have constructive sorrow-a love motivated desire to change. Another was thinking about how God loves us so much-that if I was the only person in the world who was a sinner, Jesus would probably still die just for me.&nbsp;It's mind-boggling-never really thought/considered it too much before-that God loves us that much!! And then just comparing it to how much I love God... food for thought...   mmm well I'll go bak to writing up on my own blog about ANCON-soo much to write up or i'll prolly forget them all by the end of next week so yeah :):)

      I love that song soooooooo much! I wish we could do it for band... but i dun know if they have it in sheet music or in tabs. Oh... Ming's at camp if you didn't know... Sigh... no mucking around with Ming for a whole week! I'm starting to miss him... Apart from the fact that i have to seek revenge on him... Mwahahaha! Yes... he will indeed recieve judgement this time... he's not getting away with it even though he lead the forgiveness study... haha...  &nbsp; I dun know why, I just feel like I have the energy to do wat is right now. It's just I've been lacking that energy for sooo long! I just decided to hate the world. I could see hope, but I just didn't live in hope. There is so much knowledge in my head but it just does correspond to the way I think and act. Oh wellz... Maybe if you went out for a run Fi, you might feel a little better? I dun know... &nbsp; I can't make it to this week's Band coz it's on thursday. I've made a commitment of Friday and unless it suits me I won't be able to come. It's not becoz I dun love the Band like crazy, it's coz of sku and parents. It's annoying, I know, I'm sorry, I really hope that you guys can understand. When I go to Uni then maybe we can practice every week!!! : P

       I am always humbled and thankful by the fact that God's love for me is not based upon my performance as a Christian but rather on the life and death of His own perfect Son. This is love indeed!"1 John 4:9,10 - Nathan Tasker     &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;      Your love changes me        &nbsp;     I look in the mirror/At the man in front of me/Just a hazy reflection/Of all the things I want to be/I’m so frustrated by all the compromise/And I’m so embarrassed by the way I feast on the hollow lies/When your truth is so much sweeter/ And your love is so much deeper//Chorus/  You cannot love me more/And you will no love me less/Though I come to you with nothing/ And receive your righteousness/I come just as I am/Oh, but here’s the mystery/While I can come without changing/but your love changes me  //I sometimes imagine/ When I am all alone/ That given some more time/ I could have done this on my own/How could I be so blinded by my pride?How could I forget I was dead before you gave me life? For you are The Great Life Giver/and you are The Promise Keeper// Chorus // Bridge:   Nothing of my own I bring/ Simply to your cross I cling/ Well, nothing of my own/So I know it’s you alone/That gives me everything….For you loved before I loved you/And you’ve done what I could never do!  //Chorus// &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;

       thnx to everyone who love me as i am. Like alysha, i think lately i've just fallen so far. so fast. a tumble right down to the bottom,&nbsp;not a stumble. everything seems to be so wrong these days. Everything is so&nbsp;flawed, nothing seems to realli b going right. not satisfied with much.     &nbsp;   i guess ive been a bit strange lately, but yeah, i realli treasure those who accept me as i am, and nothing more. while i was watching the&nbsp;'birthday bash' on&nbsp;"oprah" , it was talking about CSI. crime scene investigation for those who are so naieve.&nbsp;(bot forensics)&nbsp;They go through all the scientific devices they use&nbsp;in reali life to solve crime. There was one bit that realli striked me. There was a doctor who investigated carcass for a few months up to a&nbsp;year or two.&nbsp;These people die a natural death, and the family wants to know why they died. She slowly unpackages them, and takes samples to be screened etc. Trying to find out why they died.     &nbsp;   In one of the carcasses, she takes apart the body. Like an animal in the butcher, the body is dissembled. i see a row of ribs, like the spare ribs u c in the butcher. It reminds me of how fragile the human body is. We are NOTHING much realli, than a bit of flesh and meat. So fragile to disease and&nbsp;accidents. We are vulnerable, though when we are alive, there's is soooo much life in the voice, in the expression, in the face, the warmth of the palm.&nbsp;In reality, we are very vulnerable, and just like the animals u see in the butcher. We are no less than them, in a biochemical sense. Life is truely precious.     &nbsp;   There's a song by nathan tasker. Lysh and i realli like it.     &nbsp;   We go to God as we are.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can offer him nothing, and bring him nothing&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but   he loves as JUST AS WE ARE.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the amazing thing is that he will&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  love us no more,      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and he cannot love us any less.     A  lthough we bring him nothing, we are changed by his love.

      Hmmm... wat should I say??? Thank you all of you for being who you are. It's just really touching at times that we care abt each other. I really want to get people to come into this blog but i think they have a really high filter on so i can't get to them so easily. This is really a good way to share how he feel and how we're going spiritually. I mean I can truthfully tell you that I'm not going that well. But I'm starting to pick it back up again I'm starting to feel the energy and love that God has given me to give others again and so I shall start my term very happily. &nbsp; I believe that any put together with God = 100% goodness. Sometimes we stumble, so wat! If it was in God's will that we stumble, then so be it! I've stumbled this time along with you Fi, this time. And I'm glad to do so coz at least we know that we will 4eva be there 4 each other. The more we go through, the stronger our friendship will be. Ming, I'm not leaving you out of this. This ain't just girl talk! This applies to all of us... Hmmm... just need others to come in first lol... &nbsp; Thx for being who you are, so let us be 4evafriends.

      well its not too bad an idea IMHO-like most crashes after that time'd probably occur due to drinking and/or speeding.... with the curfew it might help reduce the amount of crashes due to these factors... so yeah i'm not sure-it might save lives, but similarly banning knives'd probably also save lives....

      yes, it was quite a bit of work preparing that study. anyways, i reali hope its not too badly written. hmm.... hope its ok and not too bad and everyone gets ALOT out of it!!!and hope everyone leading it does it with much love and effectively. i also wish i did strand 2 at kylc though, it would make writing it so much easier i think!! nevermind. life is so fast sometimes. e.g. after holiday everything has just been happening, as in lots of things to do. and exam results were ok. not great or anything. hmm.... still annoyed at ppl who get more marks than me, who distract me during lectures though!!! =S i'll just have to play it fair, and be content with the way things are. maybe* i will try a bit harder next semester!!

      Yeah been quite busyish-not that much sleep either-I mean, my parents forcing me to get up on Sunday at 10am, even when I have nothing on-it's not as if I get much sleep on any other day. Then after waking up, having to listen to them argue like children-and this occurs on an almost daily basis. I could shut them up by telling them they're behaving like children instead of adults but I'm too tired to. And anyway it seems insignificant to what's happened this morning-yeah Eddie's mum died of cancer this morning... it'd be nice if you ppl could pray for his family in their time of need.  mmm i betta go bak and *try* working.

      are ppl just too busy to write on the blog or can't be bothered or just don't go online that much because u sleep alot?  hmm yup i haven't been online since wednesday! luckily there wasn't any urgent emails.. cos i didn't read any of them that fast =)  personaly i sleep alot and spend more time at uni these days.  oooo and its beeeeeen super sitting in quincy's car. in the *distant* future, quincy said i can b on a roster wif him for driving to uni!! how cool. so quincy can sleep in the car half the time and i can sleep in the car half the time. (becos all the other guys are no where near getting their ps - but then again, they could learn faster than me becos im soooooooooooo SLOW !! ) lol....    and its not worth driving to uni by urself because the petrol costs too much!!! so for the next few years, i think i'll be car pooling still  =) its sooooo much more economical and time efficient when u see the sign "T3"!!!!!! whoohooooooo............ zooooooom zoooom zoooooooom ooo the other day, we were drivin in T3 lane, and then two policemen comes out from the corner. The car infront of us didn't have 3 ppl, so they got fined !! =)

      Uni's just started again-yay :/ 8am starts everyday! gonna be sooo fun >.  Aint all bad tho-yeah yesterday met with Lisa Stadtmueller from the electron microscopy unit-a really cool place at the bottom of Madson building-its got 13 electron microscopes (both SEM, TEM), x-ray diffraction equipment, mass spectrometers... everything!! wish i could work there someday >.  Thermal/Mechanical Treatments of Light Alloys for Atom Probe Analysis   -What do I get to do? "The Atom Probe is EMUâ€™s latest acquisition and one of only 4 of itskind in the world. Work with a group to develop new specimen preparationtechniques involving electropolishing, Precision Ion Polishing Systemand/or Focused Ion Beam milling." sounds fun =P mmmm so gonna know not what to do tho >.   ok i'll stop procrastinating and go bak to ANCON =)   Thursday - Day 4   haha about 8 of us woke up around 5:45ish to watch the sunrise-which we didnt see coz there were clouds on the horizon! >.  In the morning session we learnt about 2 Corinthians chapter 10. The chapter talks about how us, as Christians, we have divine, God given power to demolish strongholds. Are Christians called to be wimps or warriors? Paul was said to be 'bold' when away and 'timid' face to face by others, saying "His letters are weighty and forceful, but in person he is unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing"-however Paul remonstrates, saying that when present, actions speak louder than words. Also, he says that we are not to boast, except to boast in Jesus Christ.   During free time me and Ben wandered off to chat, play around with some music and practicing hacky sack for a while before heading off to watch 'theatre sports'-if you dont know what that is, its where you have different groups competing against each other in different theatric 'games' which are absolutely hilarious :P the different years were competing, with the 2nd years eventually winning on score by the judges, although all the groups were sooo funny i just couldnt stop laughing >.  &nbsp;so yeah the games were like-the 'space jump' game is where you have the host giving the first person in the team a scenario which they have to act out-for example, going to a Krispy Kreme shop. Then the person acts out the scenario, until the host yells 'spacejump' and the person acting has to freeze-then another person of the team jumps on, and then continues from that position into another scenario, which may be totally unrelated to the first-eg, in the Krispy Kreme scenario changes to a boss and servant scenario, with the boss scolding the servant. Then 'spacejump' is continued to be yelled, until all the team are onstage performing. Then each successive spacejump removes an actor, and the remaining ppl have to act out the previous scenario.... until nobody's left-really funni!! another is where u have ppl acting a scenarioi and have to change from different scenarios-eg drama, opera, etc....   Then we had the main session-of which the main question was about the Christian identity.   Step 1-The move from 'Christ died for us' to 'we died with/in him'-for we were 'buried with him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life'.   Step 2-In Christ, therefore in the Spirit, therefore the Spirit in us-we are now dead to the body, but alive in the Spirit-and thus sons of God   Step 3-The Spirit is the Spirit of adoption-the Spirit bears witness that we are the sons of God-and hence all of us are sons of God, no matter of gender   Step 4-If children, then heirs-if we are God's children, then we are heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ-we are the heirs of eternal life and EVERYTHING   Then we investigated some complicated stuff about who we are, and how God sees us-who are we? After becoming a Christian, am I still the same me or a different person? Or am I half me and half Christ? or what? And how does God see me? Does God see me as I 'really' am, does God look past me seeing only Christ?   If we're Christians, how are we meant to live our lives?  1. We are to live in freedom and joy.  2. In obedience and holiness.  3. In the spiritual community of the new humanity.  4. In hope.   Thursday night was crazy but absolutely great fun-around 11:30pm or so, us from ACES along with many other ppl from other faculties decided to go to the headland, walking through the streets, beach and bushland. Eddie brought his guitar along, playing music along the way, and along the way we tried playing hacky-sack-not too successful as it was too dark to see but anyway it was great fun :) - then at the headland we looked at the great view in the dark-such a great view that yeah we just had to go see at midnight, freezing, and with a strong wind =P anyhow it was great fun chatting and singing !! :D afterwards we went back and played 500 till 3AM-couldve played longer but we had drivers in our group so yeah they had to go sleep :/&nbsp;   tired-sooo much time spent at uni-partly my fault for sleeping so late everyday tho =) so yeah i'll finish this off some other time! keke i kno-i will tho! l8rs!

       Wednesday-Day 3    In the morning session we studied 2 Corinthians 5. We were learning about the motivating factor of the cross in lives. We, as Christians, are new creations, where the old is gone and the new has come. We have a new relationship with God, with whom we are now friends with. We are set free from our past, and we are reconciled with God, having a restoration of intimacy with God. Everything we do should be out of love-for example, Paul was under the spell of God's love, and that's why he did everything out of Christ's love for us. The question we should be asking is, how do we become a person controlled by God's love?   In our free time, we had the Lekabio(?) cup (I don't have a clue how to spell it so I dont know!!). It's a touch football competition between the various faculties of the EU. The teams this year were engineering, science, ag/vets/CaL(com/law), and ACES/ecos. Our team, ACES/ecos, won our first game ever at ANCON!! It was 1-0 vs ag/vets/CaL so yeah :) tho how we won seems more than a tad suspicious lol-we only try we scored was from a intercepted pass from&nbsp;Joyce from the other team, who is incidentally an ex-ACES member =P  The night session was about salvation from God-its history, what the NT has to say about it, and understanding atonement.  1) The history of God's salvation plan-we looked through various areas related to salvation in the old testament-the passover/exodus, the day of atonement, sacrifices, and the practice of redemption. 2) The new testament as a witness to the cross as God's salvation for us 3) The various ways we can understand atonement- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. A condemnation that brings justification-God condemned sin in the flesh, Jesus, so that we may be justified &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. A sacrifice that cleanses us before God-Christ is our high priest, who by his blood, through the eternal Spirit, offered himself without blemish to God, purifying us &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. A ransom which redeems-We were redeemed from sin by the payment of Jesus' precious blood, like a lamb without defect or blemish &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. An obedience which makes us righteous-just as Adam's disobedience led to condemnation for all, Jesus' act of obedience brings justification and life to all &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. A propitiation&nbsp;(*properly signifies the removal of wrath by the offering of a gift)&nbsp;which&nbsp;reconciles and brings peace-Jesus was put forward by God as a sacrifice of propitiation by his blood, effective through our faith &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f. A dying under sin which makes us alive-one died for all, so that in Jesus we have died to sin, and may be set free form it  Meh-too tired >.

      Weeeeeee!! just got bak from&nbsp;the EU&nbsp;ANCON (annual conference)&nbsp; at Collaroy Conference Centre-learnt SO MUCH and had heaps of fun along the way! It seems really short now-wish it was longer :/ oh well-still-made the best of these holidays so yeah its been good =) and Collaroy Conference Centre is such a nice venue-with the beach, shops.... and us from ACES got the ensuites!!which were like 2-3 ppl in a room with its own bathroom-with hightech showerheads which do different weird stuff when u twist them :):):)    Monday-Day 1    Okay, so I woke up around 7:00AM on Monday morning as Nat was meant to pick me up around 9AM-after eating brekke (ham+eggs, and honey nutri-grain), waited up till around 9:15AM when Nat still hadn't turned up :/ so yeah called Eddie who was at Jeremy's place and found out they hadn't been picked up either-and they were meant to be picked up b4 me!! well-yeah found out that Nat was 1/2 an hr late..... and then he went to the wrong 74 Murray Farm Rd!! doh-yeah he went to the carlingford side instead of beecroft >.  Okay we arrived there about 10:50AM and it was raining a bit so we went off to eat some morning tea before having the welcoming session in the main auditorium. The camp's theme topic was 'The Cross of Christ', investigating God's infinite justice and yet also His infinite mercy. The session introduced the cross, and how the people during the Roman empire perceived criminals punished by the cross, and 'the madness of proclaiming a crucified God'. 4 points discussed included   -Crucifixion was a widespread public phenomenon during the time-it was a public penalty used as a deterrent against crime  -It was shameful-criminals who were crucified underwent the utmost public indignity, enduring mocking, spitting... etc  -It was restricted to the 'scumbags'-the lowest of society, to hardened criminals  -It was horrific/obscene-so obscene that it was not mentioned in public society-"Let even the name of the cross be kept away not only from the bodies of the citizens of Rome, but also from their thought, sight and hearing."--Cicero, 54BC   People of the time thought of the message of a crucified redeemer was ridiculous-with the example caricature 'Alexamenos worships his God', whereby worshipping Christ as God is like worshipping an ass.   We also learnt about the two different alternative theologies-  1) The theology of glory  2) The theology of the cross   (1) states that we can see and know the 'invisible things of God' by looking at the world he made and how it works, these 'invisible things' being 'virtue, godliness, wisdom, justice, goodness and so forth'. These characteristics seem to be what humans are to strive for, and of which find perfection in God. The theology of glory thus would mean that us humans can find a way to God through a 'glory road' where we may find God.   (2) states that we can only really know God by examining the 'invisible things of God' by what has actually happened/occurred-that we cannot say what God is or isnt, what He can or cannot do/be by our own preconceptions of who God is, but by rather what God has done. For example, we can make simplistic arguments that do not work-God is everywhere. Jesus when on earth was not everywhere. Hence Jesus is not God. Or another argument such as God has all authority and power, and is such cannot a servant and not humble, that God cannot look upon sin, but Jesus became as sin for us etcetera etcetera.... yeah quite interesting stuff and that was just the first day-the easiest actually!!   Then in the night session we went through the events leading up to and after the crucifixion-a relatively straightforward exercise - just to be hit with all the hard stuff on Tuesday :):):)   On Monday night we had a faculty time-which was great fun ^^ we had a competition to see which group could build the best tower made out of straw, based on criteria such as height, aesthetic appeal and the amount of weight it could lift. In&nbsp; my team was Jeremy, Hannah and Borin-and we all set to work. We first decided that we'd just go all out for height-so we put straws in each other to make really really long straws-but then we found out that it must support at least 1 of the weights to be in the competition, so we bent them around to form like a dome shape. So we kinda scrapped the goal of making the tallest tower towards making it as strong as we could-it ended up being quite dodgyish, unbalanced, but at least it was.... um-'flexible' and 'adjustible' =P and Jeremy with the last few minutes just decided to wrap lots upon lots of sticky tape all around our tower-kinda mucked it up but anyway ^^ it ended up being neither tall or strong...it just ended up looking more like a volcano than a tower lol-actually we didnt do too badly-we came 2nd last!! yay!!    Tuesday - Day 2     &nbsp;  This day was absolutely crazy-if u havent heard of it before, the 'confusion curve' is a curve that describes confused ANCON ppl are throughout the camp-and Tuesday night is usually the point where everybody is the most confused =S the morning session was relatively straightforward, discussing the gospel and ministry-how we may be tempted to change the gospel to make it more 'palatable'. However, the problem is not with the gospel-it is with the receiver- 'If the gospel is veiled or ineffective, then it is veiled to those who are perishing'. Although we may be frustrated, we should still present the gospel wholly, without distorting the message.   After lunch we all went off to the beach for the sandcastle building competition. ACES had built a big 'boot' for a sandcastle- lol&nbsp;tho Borin didnt recognise what it was when we saw it completed :P the sandcastle that ended up winning was of a dragon-which at first sight I'd had thought was a stegosaurus, and Borin'd thought was an alligator..... yeah neither of us had noticed the wings lol >.  Now for the mind-boggling stuff at the main session-our salvation is via an act of God, not just a message&nbsp;of God-this makes it such that its not by us responding to God that we are saved, as God saved us through this act.&nbsp;We learnt funky words such as 'immanent' Trinity, and 'economic' Trinity, the alternatives to Trinitarian Christianity such as Modalism and Arianism-confused yet?! I was!! Trinitarian Christianity postulates that  1) There is one God  2) Jesus is God,&nbsp;the Holy Spirit is God, and the Father is God  3) Jesus is not the Spirit,&nbsp;and both are&nbsp;not the Father.   Modalism states that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are God, who is just playing different roles as the Father, Son and Holy&nbsp;Spirit. Why this doesnt work is then that we can't really know God at all-we just see God 'acting' in different roles, and cannot know who&nbsp;God really is.   Arianism states that there are 3 different Gods-tritheism. That the Father is God, while the Son is a lesser God and the Spirit an even lesser God. This removes the gospel-as it is not really God who saves us but a lesser God.   Other points we discussed were&nbsp;that the Son is not&nbsp;just an object of the Father's action. That he was an 'innocent bystander' punished for our&nbsp;sins. As such would be an&nbsp;'immoral salvation'. For example, if&nbsp;the&nbsp;daughter in&nbsp;a family had done something wrong, and then the son was punished for her&nbsp;wrongdoing, then such a punishment would be&nbsp;'immoral'.  As J. Stott put it, 'We&nbsp;must not then, speak of God punishing Jesus or Jesus persuading God, for to do so is to set them over against each other as if they acted independently of each other or were even in conflict with each other. We must never make Christ the object of&nbsp;God's punishment or God the object of Christ's persuasion, for both God and Christ&nbsp;were subjects not objects, taking the intiative to save us sinners.'   As you can see by now, quite complicated/deep stuff. Then we had a question time after supper, where the main session speaker, Andrew&nbsp;Katay, answered questions from the audience.&nbsp;Question time was really&nbsp;good&nbsp;=D with&nbsp;really difficult answers from the audience&nbsp;answered very well by Andrew-learnt alot there too!!&nbsp;Questions about Triniarianism, Calvanism,&nbsp;etcetera&nbsp;were all answered&nbsp;by&nbsp;Andrew along with his good sense of humor =) i gtg&nbsp;out now - going out to eat dinner&nbsp;=D i'll finish this off some other time- l8rz!!  &nbsp;

      Hi again-yeah we had a "party" today - tho half the time we were working on the workshop on forgiveness today :/&nbsp;As usual E and Fi got here early, and me and Dad went to pick Kat up from the station-it was due in at like 10:04am but the trains were late as they often are nowadays :@ and Mandii-yeah well she kinda slept in ^_^ &nbsp; So yeah we started off by going through the study-to make sure of all of us knew the material we were leading with today. And of course, Eric just had to eat chips right in front of Fi who has a stomach ache-aren't we nice ppl? :P then we ate some spaghetti, fruit&nbsp;and drank some soft drink for lunch-with icecream for dessert which we all ate in front of Fi (mwahahaha!! no icecream 4 u!!) - wasn't the icecream great?! mmmmm yum!! &nbsp; then we went thru making the 3 skits we performed today-haha kinda last minute but oh wellz -- if u dont know what it's about its about 2 kids (E and Kat), and Kat's listening to Ghetto Superstar... then E comes along, doesnt like the music and so takes the CD out and breaks it in front of Kat-yeah i told u we were nice ppl ^_^ then we had 3 different hilarious cut scenes where they forgive each other, dont forgive and the last where they pretend to forgive each other. I think performing these skits were the highlight of the forgiveness workshop today-yeah E and Kat are really funni ^^ &nbsp; As for the workshop overall? Well we kinda started 10 minutes late and the studies took a tad longer than we thought-the game were nice and humorous-(with some last minute modifications), which illustrated the principle of grace quite well. We didnt end up symbolically burning pieces of paper at the end-but otherwise the workshop went along pretty good :) &nbsp; Yeah-was a good experience leading-and yeah now I'm bak home-kz bb!!

      Why can't parents act like parents instead of little kids? Getting kind of sick and tired of their arguments everyday-you get the impression that they hate each other's guts. I won't get into the icky details-but it's like they live to annoy the hell out of each other, without caring what happens to me and my sister. Well, they do care about me and my sister, but often you wouldn't think that. What should I do? I could probably shut them up by telling them to grow up and behave like adults, but then they'll continue arguing some other time and I'm too tired at the moment anyway... sometimes (like now)I wish could kick them out of the house by calling the police due to them being a domestic disturbance but hey... it might help like when I called them and my sister left for a few weeks... but then they own this place hmmm...  yeah I know this is a very pessimistic post but hey that's what happens around here on an almost daily basis... Could you people please pray for my family (if that's not being selfish)? It seems to be getting worse and worse each week. Well, one good thing has happened though-my sister has started coming to church again! :D even though it's a different church to where the rest of us go to (Epping Baptist) but still. I suppose things could be worse (like my parents being dead)-oh yeah so could you people pray for Eddie's family? His mother died this morning from cancer so it'd be nice if you could pray for them in their grief.  Mmmm they're still at it-really quite hard to study-I think I'd better go and *try* to do some work...   Psalm 42   As the deer pants for streams of water,  so my soul pants for you, O God.  2 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.  When can I go and meet with God?  3 My tears have been my food  day and night,  while men say to me all day long,  "Where is your God?"  4 These things I remember  as I pour out my soul:  how I used to go with the multitude,  leading the procession to the house of God,  with shouts of joy and thanksgiving  among the festive throng.   5 Why are you downcast, O my soul?  Why so disturbed within me?  Put your hope in God,  for I will yet praise him,  my Savior and 6 my God.   My [3] soul is downcast within me;  therefore I will remember you  from the land of the Jordan,  the heights of Hermon-from Mount Mizar.  7 Deep calls to deep  in the roar of your waterfalls;  all your waves and breakers  have swept over me.   8 By day the LORD directs his love,  at night his song is with me-  a prayer to the God of my life.   9 I say to God my Rock,  "Why have you forgotten me?  Why must I go about mourning,  oppressed by the enemy?"  10 My bones suffer mortal agony  as my foes taunt me,  saying to me all day long,  "Where is your God?"   11 Why are you downcast, O my soul?  Why so disturbed within me?  Put your hope in God,  for I will yet praise him,  my Savior and my God.

      Aaargh soo annoyed - I'd written out this post before, and it was fine, and then when I edited it only part of it was sent ruining the whole thing! sigh and now I have to post it all again.... oh well >. .  On Monday last week, we visited the Australian Natural History Museum for biology, answering pages and pages of questions on human evolution using the various displays scattered around, vainly trying to find the answers-great fun eh =). My group included Kevin, Sajevan, Evelyn and Greg-and unlike SOME people who will not be named we actually answered them properly, answering the questions indvidually. Took almost forever but learnt quite a bit. Afterwards, we wasted about 30 minutes copying the information we'd need for our biology presentation next week on old and new world monkeys until we realised that one of us had brought a digital camera-I know, Ruse ppl are meant to be smart >.  Friday was a good day, as I got to wake up late (9am! yay!! :D) and then we had a physics tutorial at uni-a group of me, Kevin, Sarah and Rachel-and we managed to break a few of the demonstrations on display (and no it wasn't me who broke them-seriously!!) there was the cartesian diver who we managed to get upside down so that when the bottle is squeezed air came out of the diver.... oops. Then we had a chemistry practical which was quite boring-it was about the purification and extraction of piperine from pepper, and performing H-NMR on the sample. Half the time was spent trying to correspond the various peaks of the NMR diagram with the structure of piperine, and the various mass spec fragments with corresponding fragments of piperine-fun fun. Band practice was cancelled on Friday, but me and Fi still went off to eat at the shops around Eastwood since they told us on the last minute (Friday morning actually)-we walked to Red Rooster, and then decided we didn't want to eat any of the food there so walked all the way to the opposite end-to the Vietnamese(?) restaurant near Commonwealth Bank-quite nice food there, thanks for introducing me to a pretty decent restaurant Fi =)  Saturday-went off to tutor the 4th grade (Simon) and 8th grade (Jackie) students-I hope I wasn't the one who passed them their cold - so yeah that wasn't too flash with us all sneezing and everything. Then there was core group at church, then the service-singing for the service together with Fi-you do have a pretty voice!-just try singing a tad louder =) -good thing I didn't sneeze throughout the leading unlike the practices beforehand (thankyou God!!). The bible studies on study afterwards were quite decent-and the skits on study were quite hilarious-except I'm totally inept at acting but anyway >.  Sunday was a really good day-even though I had to wake up quite early to visit NDCCCS. Got driven by Hannah there-yeah kinda weird for a guy to be driven by a gal but thx :) yeah I should prolly get my Ps soon oh well. The bible study in the morning was on James and was really good-in depth, an informative discussion of the text helped us understand the text alot-and it's always good to do a study with high school friends - too bad Dippy was late and missed the bible study tho :/ then there was a short evangelistic talk which was straightforward to the message-with the benefit that we had plenty of time to talk afterwards =) so yeah got to see Aaron, Henry, Dennis, Ming Chak, Karen, and previous Ruse students like Danny =D so yeah those are the highlights of the past days-maybe I'll go finish ANCON another time-if ever-but yeah =)
