       urlLink    This is one of my first self portraits, as you can see there is no life in them there eyes. I was going through a sick faze at that time. medicine the whole bit! 10 years ago I was told I had Multi Centric Glioma..They had me on the table halo and all took me to ct so they would know where to position to do brain surgery, I guess it wasn't my time, what they saw was so small they couldn't even put a needle in it. Doc said in all his years as a neurosurgeon that had never happned to him. the night before surgery I asked god please not now I'm not ready, punish me another way not this! Well when all was said and done they told me I have MS and not Cancer ( I was thrilled! ) I know I know your going ewww MS? well it's a hell of a lot better than glioma. Oh yea exactly 3 months later my husband at the time left me for a another woman. I guess that was my trade off. It just shows you that you can be on top of the world one minute and the next looking into where you want to be buried. I'll take MS for now. I still walk and talk and if you met me you would not know I had it. I'm doing things now I would never done when I was married, I feel as if I was reborn 10 years ago.    Symptoms Of Multiple Sclerosis  Symptoms of MS may be mild or severe and of long duration or short and appear in various combinations. The initial symptom of MS is often blurred or double vision, red-green color distortion, or even blindness in one eye. Most MS patients experience muscle weakness in their extremities and difficulty with coordination and balance. Most people with MS also exhibit paresthesias, transitory abnormal sensory feeling such as numbness or "pins and needles." Some may experience pain or loss of feeling. About half of people with MS experience cognitive impairments such as difficulties with concentration, attention, memory, and judgment. Such impairments are usually mild, rarely disabling, and intellectual and language abilities are generally spared. Heat may cause temporary worsening of many MS symptoms.     1. Numbness, weakness, tingling or paralysis in one or more limbs, impaired vision and eye pain, tremor, lack of coordination or unsteady gait, and rapid involuntary eye movement. A history of at least two episodes of a cluster of symptoms is necessary for a diagnosis of MS. Because MS affects the central nervous system, symptoms may be misdiagnosed as mental illness.   2.More symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis: In addition to the above information, to get a full picture of the possible symptoms of this condition and its related conditions, it may be necessary to examine symptoms that may be caused by complications of Multiple Sclerosis, underlying causes of Multiple Sclerosis, associated conditions for Multiple Sclerosis, risk factors for Multiple Sclerosis, or other related conditions. &nbsp; urlLink

      Now he is dreamy. I do not mean in a Hollywood way..I mean even if he wasn't a Movie Star I would still zero in on his rugged good looks. Not to mention the man is tall! Did I mention I was tall? 5'10 1/2  I might as well just say 5'11 besides every time a man meets me they almost always say your not 5'10 etc...You must be 6'1 because I am 5'11! Yea ok big boy I must be 6'1 in flats yea aha sure. Trust me I know how tall this girly girl is. The reason is I was crushing on a guy in high school years ago named Tim S. And he told his buddy noway she's like six feet she is too tall blah blah blah . I ran home that day (well kind strutted) anyway.. I ran past my mom and dug in my pops tool kit for the measuring tape and ran back to moms and said MEASURE ME! She was like what the hell? I said please mom Tim S. Said he wouldn't date me because I was 6 feet tall .  she did and I was exactly 5'10 1/2 went back to school the next day and pleaded my case with his buddy and he said no your not because I'm 5'10 you must be 6 feet besides he likes Ellen T. Who by the way was about 5'3 Alas another one lost to a shorty. I'm not going to lie  I never had one date in friggin high school no prom no nothing! Eh time heals. Escuse me waitress more milk please!  dd

      Hello,  Just so there is no confusion...I like the name Diana so i wouldnt have to start out with the cliche of Dear Diary (yawn)I am not really into what I should say in my first blog? Let's start out with I am looking for a part time job but it seems almost impossible lately. Well not giving up yet, something will come along. I have two lazy furry creatures laying all over my nicely made bed. these two are hysterical...one is a Akita the other is a Jack Russell FYI someone forgot to tell the bigger one that he is a Akita! I call the little JR Little Ceasar because he rules the other animals, major short jr syndrome! There a trip I have 2 dogs and 2 cats all with their own special personalities. Garfield doesnt have anything on these guys. Well gotta go and check out the classifieds then back to work. I'll write something more interesting later.   Be Free,  SB

      Dear Diana,   Today was so so...still need to finish up here in the house and get it in order. I'm a little late on spring cleaning but it seriously needs it. need to throw out stuff I don't use anymore. Also as of tommorow I am starting to take Lil Ceasar and BB out for walks by the beach theres a nice stretch to walk with them on. On a different note, one of my best friends is moving by me this week so it will be nice to have her close by. I'm feeling a little tired. Maybe I will come back later. Be Free,  Sb

      I am feeling a little unsure of myself in regards to my health? Summer just kills me! I was glad it was not hot today. for what ever reason ever MS does not agree with heat. I really need to install air unit before it gets real hot. I also stopped taking the drug neurontin for neuropathy it makes me feel way too tired and I feel I am unable to be productive while on it. I was on a drug called provigil to combat fatigue and it worked well, but it is a brand name and not covered the rest of the year. (just a few months) I need to get into guided imagery again and work on focusing on a healthier mind set. I'm hoping now that I'm off the neurontin I can start to lose this weight. It really made me feel way too tired even though it helped the neuropathy. Take Care,  dd

      Dear Diana,  I realize I have been a major downer lately. So sorry kiddo! But you need to be here in good times and bad, besides that is what Dear Dianas (Dear Diary)are good for. I am making a major effort to get in better spirits but gotta be honest it's not so easy. New announcement...I am going back on neurontin for neuropathy I can not take the nerve pain. I dread it I swear I do! But at the moment I have no choice. Starting to think my family is not the only one in denial about MS. How sad is that I have been putting up such a front all this time to make them feel proud of me for not complaining. I am to blame for their ignorance as well. Sometimes you have to stand back and observe the situation. Like the song goes..."I'm on the outside looking in" you know what? Seen enough for today. Peace,  dd

      What is up? What do I have to do to let my family understand that I get sick! My sibling said why don't you feel good,what do you mean? Why are you tired? Fuck! This has been going on for 10 years, will they ever get it? nooooo Maybe if I was on my death bed and all my family were standing in line to see me before I go...Wait! How about they stand in line and walk through and I can make the sign of the cross with my hand and bless them as they come to say goodbye, hmmm maybe just maybe? They will believe I have a condition. That's whats so fucking wrong with this MS, you walk you talk you work whatever! To them awww! There is nothing wrong. What the fuck! Ok now I'm pissed!!! I'm seriously being honest when I say this... there are times I am so fffing weak from this I can not get up in the morning. When I go to stand its as if I have steel go go boots on. I'm tired,I'm hot,I'm pissed, and I'm hungry! Nice...Real nice.

      I just found a CD from thee midniters a east la band from the sixties, I can't believe they didn't go further in their career's! These guys were underrated. What a shame :( for their time they were known for what today would be called punk like music (some songs) definitely a frat band as well...You be the judge. Peace,  deardiana    listen for audio of song.

      Well I'm working on 3 monologues. When a man loves a woman (I'm Alice) Paper Moon (Trixie) Laundry and bourbon. (neglected wife) Trixie so far is pretty much my favorite right now. She is brassy sassy and oh so bad! I'm not your skinny model looking wanna bee actress, I'm a woman who has way to many lumps and bumps...LOL nothing to be ashamed of I'm working on it. One thing is for sure no matter how much weight I might release I will never be a leading lady type. I'm more your bigger tough looking Italian broad. Hey maybe I could get on the sopranos and be one of his flunkies I could play his long lost sister or maybe I could play a hit woman? Now that would be oh so the kind! I notice when I sometimes am out and about I get a lot of looks from men staring at me ever so curiously...Like hmmmmm is that a man in drag? Now don't get me wrong I'm no hairy faced chick! Besides out here where I live the tranies are so pretty a lot better looking than some women. I use to go out with gay friends to clubs and I would talk with a deeper voice because I didn't want to be a wall flower . It worked I was the bell of the ball. I'm tall so I can see how it would confuse. LOL not a problem as long as I was able to dance my ass off I was happy. Gay clubs are great to let go no one judges they all are their to just be free and happy. gonna go now I'm going to make myself some dinner. Maybe I'll be back later. Peace,  DD

      OK I am having nooo luck lately! I fell down again this time I broke my middle toe, Nice! I swear there are times I walk like a lady...But lately it's like I'm walking like a drunken hooker. Fucking MS!! I remember the good old days being able to walk in 4 inch heels, yea right. I used to watch sex and the city just to watch Carrie and her cronies walking in their high heels and salivate at the sight of them running, walking, crossing legs,slipping on, slipping off their manolo's. There are times I see girls and I stare at them walking so confident and gracious and wish for the same. I can not begin to tell you how this has humbled me the last 10 years, I used to be so into clothes and shoes etc.. Now its all about budgets and what meds can I afford this month? If I can't afford it I don't buy it. If there is one thing I have learned from this condition, its humility and patience. Yes I may walk a little off balance,bump into walls,get way too tired,battle migraines,weight,symptoms,simple life,no luxuries, but for what ever reason I still feel grateful for not being in a wheel chair or losing my sight and all the other stuff that may come with this someday. Noticing gray hair and freaking out is a thing of the past, what for? Gray hair doesn't keep you from walking or talking,expensive shoes don't bring me happiness either. I would be just as happy as a pig in Mudd if I could walk in 4 inch heels from walmart! What would be nice is to be totally well again and not have to deal with these obstacles. They don't teach you how to deal with humility when you get diagnosed they tell you how to give your self shots or they tell you when to take your meds or when to come in for your next appt. Peace, dd

      Dear Diana,  Why is it sometimes I feel like I'm running on empty? Yesterday was my 10 year anniversary since I was diagnosed. Am I being a baby Diana? As I was walking to the restroom to get in the shower I bounced off the wall hitting my shoulder for the millionth time! The NFL doesn't have anything on these shoulders. Anyway there I was in the shower teetering like a happy drunk only problem was I wasn't sauced,  "what a shame" As I was hosing myself down it came to me...Maybe I could get a chair to sit in while I showered? Would I be giving in to this monster? Or would I be prolonging any future accidents? I still cant bring myself to get a handicaps plaque for my car, look Diana remember still walking here! ewww threes a title "Diana Walking" maybe a little tilted  but still walking. On to a different subject The letter I sent to my parents came back, no its not what your thinking I forgot to put a stamp??? Did I do this subconsciously or did I actually forget to put it? Now I feel nervous to send it but I will.

      Letter I found from 1995  Dear Alex,  I am writing you this letter to tell you Happy Birthday and also to say thank you! You are probably wondering why I am saying thank you? Well little Alex almost one year ago you and I went to San Juan together, remember we went on the train? That is when you drew this picture, I have saved it ever since. Up until that day I was feeling sorry for myself. After spending the day with you I realized there was no reason to feel that way. Alex you may not realize this but you were a big inspiration to me back then and still are! One day when you get older you will understand there was something you said to me in the church that I will never forget. I still laugh and cry when I think about it.   We were both kneeling down I was praying for strength and guidance anything! You were beside me. Also kneeling down, barely able to put your little chin on the pew, My hair was down that day and as I bowed my head down which caused my hair to  cover my face. I did this because I was crying so hard I was shaking. Alex what you said to me will always remind me of how so special you are. Tourist were looking and whispering in the church I could even heard someone taking pictures, As I glanced I saw a man just clicking away taking mine and your picture. I felt helpless unable to say stop! Then all of a sudden I see these little hands start to lift my hair up with both hands and somehow you crawled directly underneath me trying to find your way through my hair , you lifted my hair over your head and somehow created a makeshift tent with it. There you were looking up at me with wide blue innocent eyes, You said Aunt Boo Boo why are you crying? Don't Cry! Please aunt boo boo don't cry! Right when you said that I realized there was no reason to cry. I saw something in your eyes, what I saw was how the world is seen through a child's eyes so pure and innocent and not too far from reality. We choose our lives the way we want and that is why I choose to stop and look and see the world through your eyes. Love you so much!   Aunt Boo Boo  (dear diana)

      Seriously I sometimes wonder what if? I remember when my marriage ended I was so depressed in the beginning than it turned to anger. Boy was it a life lesson. One thing I learned from it was you don't have to be with someone to feel complete. It was a experience. I was so warped at the time the highlight of my week after working long hours at multiple jobs was to watch cops and Americas most wanted. I would seriously watch it waiting to see if my ex would be one of those losers living in a trailer park who just beat his toothless old lady, or someone who was wanted for drug trafficking. Boy was I something! I might as well had been Goldie Hawn eating frosting in front of the television like the movie Death Becomes her. I'm glad that wasn't the case. Then it happened, it was a hot august day in 1995 one month shy of my breakup my car broke down I needed to get to work because I was being threatened by my boss that if I didn't come in there would be consequences to pay. I was nervous not knowing what to do...I called everyone and anyone I could think of for a ride mind you I had less than a hour  to get to work .The bus was not a option too many transfers !it would have taken me 2 1/2 hours by the time I would have arrived. I had no choice but to call a taxi (work was at least 40 min away) as I was sitting in front of my building in 90 or so degree heat, I could see a familiar truck approaching  It was my ex with a friend he drove by me slightly looking my way with a smirk on his face...Than it happened something inside just clicked just like that I was over the loser from hell. I laughed to myself thinking what the hell was I thinking? My obsession with wanting to see him fail was gone. I felt free at last!

Odio ritenere non nel controllo!  il relativo molto importante affinchè me siano indipendente come possibile.  Cried ieri per un errore che avevo fatto, quello non sono me da essere così impressionabile.  Appena un giorno alla volta.  Sonno bene, cara diana

      My mother called me and the first thing she said was boo boo...We love you too! I was quiet I didn't know what to say? Now I know why some families have such a hard time saying those three words. She went on and on how she read the letter to my father and she started to cry, I wanted to hang up so bad! I felt vulnerable and I didn't want to show my emotions. I said ok mom I'm glad you got the letter. she said I was reading it to your father, I guess I was surprised and I thought it was from your sister...Then I realized at the end of the letter it was from you!  Look I am not going to lie to you I was hurt when  she said that. I said oh well it was me mother, she said I am so happy thank you boo boo. You know its my fault she thought it was one of her other kids I have always kept to myself. I wrote it so they would know I do think of them and I have always loved them and still do. I just never knew how to adjust to the change in regards to my family becoming so endearing. One things for sure the grandkids played a big part in them being so loving, I Never understood why parents change like that once they become grandparents. My father was the same way with his dad they were cordial but I don't remember them hugging or saying I love you. When my dads father died when I was 10 years old it was hard on us kids we were all over the house all five of us crying and screaming because grandpa died, I was in the bathroom with my older sister crying or hearts out! And my father banged on the door and said stop it! Don't cry!!! We were afraid because of how loud he yelled at us, so we stopped. All we could do was cry in the towels as quiet as possible for fear of upsetting my dad. Its as if age has softened my parents,I know their is past hurt from my mom and her upbringing she has mentioned things  more and I appreciate the fact that she trust me enough to share her pain. At least now I can put the puzzles together and see they went through similar situtations. I cant be sad from the past I can only close that door and not look back.

      Dear Mom And Dad,  I am sending this letter to you to say a few things...I know I don't say them often and I know I seem aloof at times, But I truly care for you both and yes I love you more than you both will ever know! I am getting too old to be not enjoying my life especially with my family. If you look at the big picture there were no hugs or love you's said enough in our family. Mom And Dad could we be close and enjoy each other while we still have time left? I don't want to be the one to preach, that is not what I'm doing. I am just asking to get to know you both better...Not just at holiday times but all the time!   I worry when I hear you yell at each other. As a child it scared me so, that to this day I will not allow anyone to yell at me or hurt me. I have made my mistakes in the past in regards to choices in relationships, but trust me I have learned. I don't want you to ever worry about me because I am alone and have nobody in my life. I am a pretty good survivor ;) and one thing that I have learned is I can not depend on anybody...Only myself. I am happy the way things are. Honest! I pray for you and the other kids and grandkids (everyone!) every night before I go to sleep. I haven't been to church in a while and I will be honest I felt as if god punished me 10 years ago when I first got sick. I was hurt but mostly angry I didn't want anything to do with god or the church at all! In time I realized it was my fate and I had no right blaming him. I may not go to church but I pray everyday. I read the bible, it is hard to understand some of its beliefs but I still respect its writings. It has been a long road and it has been humbling as well, But in the long run I look back and if I had to do it all over again the past years I would do it all the same. I like who I am finally! Thank you for being my parents. I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU!  Boo Boo

      I have been reading my notary handbook and I tell you it can be confusing. I take the exam the end of this month and I pray I pass.  Need to pass so I can get started and make some money and pay off my bills. I hate having bills! Making decisions should I buy my meds or should I pay more to my bills? I have had that same question every month the past couple of years. I'm afraid that I will relapse or worse not like being a notary...But that is not going to be a option I will get through this! I am so used to surviving any situation this should be no different. I am also pretty tense because my father will be having surgery this week and I hope he does well considering his age, he is almost 80 and it would devastate me if anything happened to him or my mom. He is having knee replacement surgery and he will need to have 2 shots a day to prevent him from developing dvt,clots,etc... One in the am and then before he goes to sleep so I will be driving out to my parents house twice a day. They live about 30 min away. It doesn't matter as long as he can recuperate and be able to walk better. Be back later with a audio blog.

      If someone has a beef with someone else take it to them! Don't let them take it out on you ever. I am going through a situation like this. I am not a doormat I will not coddle or protect abusers of substance or alcohol or just plain mean BS minded people. I was in alanon years ago and I think now is as good as a time as ever to join again. This is why I am a square I cant imagine being mean to people I love,because of a nasty habit. I remember being just a child watching my parents drink and get mean and belligerent with each other or worse us kids. I vowed at 5 years old I remember saying it to myself as I would hide from the screaming of my parents...I said I will never do this when I get older never! I repeated that mantra through life to my parents 10,15,20,etc..To this day I have never had a drink with my parents the other kids have but I have stood my ground, its my way of saying remember what I said. Now as they are older they are great parents! I would have done anything to have had them this way 30 years ago. They didn't drink everyday but it was on occasion, I remember each and every time because of the drama. I married a man who I thought was square I found out into the first year of marriage, he was a alcoholic and by the second year he was full blown off the wagon plus a  drug abuser. One time he woke me up from my sleep yelling and choking me screaming quit calling my mother a whore! I was gasping for air saying please please stop! He did then he broke down and cried saying I don't know what's wrong with me . I was scared to death of him. The same week I found a little plastic bag of powder I asked someone if they knew what it was and they said this is crystal if your husband is on this and he is attacking you, it will get worse! All I could do was think about what he did at the end of the week it was on a Saturday and he was kissing my ass saying I love you I will do anything for you..Sniffing sniffing the whole time (honey he wasn't crying if you know what I mean) all I could think of was him attacking me and getting away with it and still doing his shit! We had gotten home and he turned to put a video in for us to watch he was bending over...I snapped! I jumped on his back with all of my weight I pulled him on the ground in a choke hold wrapped my legs around him and said how does it feel to be choked when you don't see it coming?? He was freaked out he started to cry I'm sorry I'm sorry! I let go and I said if you ever have the urge to ever! Hurt me again you better make sure you kill me because what I will do to you will be tenfold Mother FFFFeerrr! I know I reacted to his level but to be honest I had enough! I was dealing with him pushing me around choking me, ordering me to my room, because he was sure I was taping him for the cops, this is what some tweekers do paranoid behaviors is normal. So If anyone is reading this and you are in a abusive relationship get the hell out! Or get help ASAP!! Anything is better than living in fear.

      I never wear shorts!   Well, actually once in a great while I do, its only indoors OK! I hate the way my legs look...serious they are as white as a ghost I have cellulite they jiggle, wiggle, if you look closely its almost as if you can make out expression with the cellulite. (kinda like the moon) OK so I'm exaggerating a little. but the point is I have always been this way even when I was skinny as hell! I remember once me and my sister went to the beach I had this really cute one piece with shorts with a towel wrapped around my waist. no one was around when we got there so it was perfect to get situated and lay down and not worry about anyone seeing my ghastly legs. my sister was lets go in the water...so we did. we were having a good time splashing around and what not...when all of a sudden I noticed people were starting to come in droves kids,parents,surfers, "Oh My God!" I was petrified! I said to my sister please go get my towel! she was OK...then she had this smirk on her face no you need to walk back to our spot, I said noooo please! She was no you need to stop being so self conscious. I was mortified...I would not budge, I stood in the water until practically the whole beach was empty. she finally relented and gave me my towel. I was sunburned and mad as hell!  I yelled at her and said don't talk to me you bitch! she laughed and said get over it already! I can not explain why I am this way? thin or thick its been the same always.  till next time this is cellulina ballerina signing off,(deardiana)

      Think about it? What if we had reality shows in the 80's? Yikes! I could see it now a show where you have 25 big haired,padded shouldered women so full of Aqua net they slurr when they talk.  They would have to have only 10  instead of 25 due to the fact that  there wouldn't be enough room to fit them all on the cover of people magazine. I could only imagine the fights over the mirror, Hair and shoulders! Hair and shoulders! Oh god and don't forget there would have to be at least one Madonna  Wannabee look alike. ewwww I am shivering.  Don't forget the fluorescent pink and green pumps with lacy socks. Now as  for the bachelor he would be some  w pastel colored cotton suit with greasy combed back hair ,with his hands constantly in his pockets stud.   Where would he take them on dates so there hair and his  suit doesn't get messed up? As for the rose ceremony...There isn't one, He would give them a can of hairspray just enough to last them until the next elimination. After about the eighth ceremony its time to finally get rid of the meanest and nastiest hooch out of them all! Think of the skankiest conveying 80's chick you can remember, come on you know who she is!  She walks up to him (his hands still in his pockets) he tells her sorry but he didn't feel there was a connection. She looks deep into his eyes, adjusts her pads on her dress she looks down then up at him one last time and says... "Its ok really,Its ok " she hugs her fellow hair sisters and says goodbye.  She tries not to cry and smear her inch thick makeup. She gets in the limousine and has to practically lay down because of her ridiculously big hair ,as she is slouched as low as she can go. She starts to cry, Girl friend  Loses it bigtime! Wailing and crying saying she was the best! I'm the  cuter one, happening clothes,bigger hair,I mean ahh...What was he thinking ? OH MY GOD! She reaches in her purse for her hairspray pssst..pssst..She shakes the can over and over trying to spray just one more spray...As she looks down at her hand she sees just how desperate she had been to find a man. as the limo continues to drive her away from that big house on the hill she loosens her grip,she knew it was impossible. all that was left was hairspray residue on her finger tip, She lowers the window...She throws the empty can out of the limousine, She sits back and rests her hand to her face day dreaming of what could've been?  She  briefly smells her finger and starts to laugh! The limo driver asks  if there is anywhere special she might like to go? "Yes she replied can you please take me to the nearest restroom... I need to wash my hands!"

      I feel anxious about my sister moving back to California, I just wish her and her family were here already. My parents will be totally complete with all of their kids in California especially my dad. As soon as he is feeling better I want to go away with both my parents for a weekend we usually have a good time together. This past month has been so stressful but at the same time it has made me happier in more ways than one. My family obviously has become closer than ever, this makes me ecstatic!

       I had some time to take a drive tonight...They were shooting a movie by my house. This is pretty common where I live.&nbsp; last summer bad Santa with Billy bob Thornton was filmed all over the city. It was the middle of summer and there were decorations everywhere downtown...It actually looked silly considering the weather was like in the 90's.&nbsp; I need to get a listing of when they do this in the future so I can take some night shots. What ever they were doing last night they were hosing down the street to make it look as if it had rained.&nbsp; it seemed like a good setup they were filming in front of a vintage clothing store.&nbsp;

      Sometimes it is difficult and confusing to admit that you are in an abusive relationship, or to find a way out, but there are clear signs to help you know if you are being abused. If the person you love or live with does any of these things to you, it's time to get help:    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeps track of what you are doing all the time and criticizes you for little things.  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Constantly accuses you of being unfaithful.  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prevents or discourages you from seeing friends or family, or going to work or school.  4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gets angry when drinking alcohol or using drugs.  5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Controls all the money you spend.  6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Humiliates you in front of others.  7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destroys your property or things that you care about.  8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Threatens to hurt you or the children or pets, or does cause hurt (by hitting,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; punching,&nbsp;&nbsp;slapping, kicking, or biting).  9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uses or threatens to use a weapon against you.  10.&nbsp; Forces you to have sex against your will.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blames you for his/her violent outbursts.   If you're a victim of violence at the hands of someone you know or love or you are recovering from an assault by a stranger, you are not alone. To get immediate help and support call The National Domestic Violence Hotline at: 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) or1-800-787-3224 (TTY)

       urlLink   I am doing a lot of cleaning today and I came across this Photo of my cousin.&nbsp; He was more my brother than a cousin. When I was about 7 years old my aunt would either come live with us with her 4 children or she would leave them with us to live. Sometimes it was a month sometimes it was six months, I loved it and I hated it! (mostly loved it)&nbsp;my cousin in the &nbsp;photo below was so imaginative. We would go to bed and my Mom or dad would say go to bed and no talking! Well that was nearly impossible for Michael, He would go on and on saying hey you guys who is badder? Spider man or speedy Gonzales? We would say... Being the loyal Hispanics that we were, Speedy Gonzales&nbsp;is. &nbsp;oh man that would make him crazy! He would go into long detail how spidey was faster more clever,badd ass suit,cooler, etc...This would go on for like an hour, of course us like idiots would fight him with words saying nahhh speedy is tough he's Mexican and he is super dooper fast! He would argue the point to exhausting and badgering us until we said ok! ok! spidey is the Baddest! "NOW GO TO SLEEP!" then he would whisper in a low voice saying...Ha see I knew I was right because spidey is cool man and spidey is the best etc.. Eventually he would finally fall asleep.&nbsp; In the morning he would remind us of our defeat and of course everytime after that it was...Mando Ramos or Andrea The Giant? It was never ending he would go as far as asking who was badder My mom or dad? This would usually be asked after my parents had one of their famous fights.&nbsp; I have to say because my cousins were there living with us they made my parents fights seem tolerable and even at times amusing. Michael would say...Oh god boo boo their fights aint nothing compared to what Jesus does to my mother! I said.. What? ?&nbsp; "Yea Jesus beats my mom all the time!" didn't you know that? I was shocked because I admired my aunt so much she was so awesome! I had no clue?  &nbsp;  As the years went on they were always coming to stay with us, we all got&nbsp; older.&nbsp; It became more clear why they were visiting,&nbsp;She..My aunt&nbsp;was always moving either to a motel or new apt.&nbsp; I realized the kids were coming when things were going bad at home. One time when I was about 11&nbsp; years old I asked&nbsp;the kids&nbsp;if Jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;ever hit them? 3 of the kids were quiet...Michael&nbsp;said yes! I said what does he do? He said boo boo he beats us with a belt if we say don't hit my mom. "He's crazy!" I was so sad I went to tell my mom and she&nbsp;could not believe what she was hearing! &nbsp;She called my aunt and screamed at her! I don't know what else they said but I do know the kids were only suppose to stay&nbsp; a week until my aunt settled in her place, They ended up staying for months.&nbsp; I have fond memories of them living with us.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  My parents didn't have a lot of money but they always made sure they took us places like the beach,fishing things that didn't cost anything.&nbsp;I remember one time when my dad was on strike with the teamsters &nbsp;they&nbsp;couldn't spend&nbsp;much so&nbsp;my parents&nbsp;took us to Hollywood and Beverly hills sight seeing. Our last stop was Grahmans Chinese theatre we were running all over the place like bandshees comparing hands and feet we were so overwhelmed it was like nothing we had ever seen. &nbsp;My mom and dad had a knack for entertaining us when they were broke. One time they drove&nbsp;us out&nbsp;to the boonies and up to a&nbsp;old house with a lot of trees around it,&nbsp; my father parked the car and he said ok everyone be real quiet shhhhh....My father proceeded to tell a ghost story about the house and how a old lady lived there and would invite kids in for candy and soda pop and how the kids would mysteriously&nbsp;disappear and never be &nbsp;seen again and&nbsp;just as he was finishing his story&nbsp;we heard whoo whoo...It&nbsp;was a owl in a treee (talk about perfect timing)&nbsp;we were holding onto each other for dear life listening with bugged out eyes! I remember I caught my mom chuckling and my father saying shhh to her. &nbsp; later in life I found out the house wasn't haunted at all! It was my father entertaining us the best way he knew how without spending any money, not to mention putting the fear of god in us to never go into a strangers house. I love him&nbsp;and my mother for that. &nbsp;they didn't just give up and not make a effort when times were bad. We really thought when they took us to these places that we were the luckiest kids ever!

       Well I am getting along ok. I spoke to my doc today and he seems to think I need to be on another med.&nbsp; I'm ok with it.&nbsp; today when I got out of the shower I just stood in front of my mirror and stared at the changes taking place with my body, middle age sucks! No sugar coating it...It sucks bigtime! I don't mind being a plus size woman...But this is just ridiculous! I have&nbsp;super sized &nbsp;myself into my jeans and its not a pretty site. I don't want to be careful of what I write this is my blog and the truth needs to be spoken from me to me...PERIOD!. Maybe if extreme makeover would take me on? No that wont happened because you have to be in excellent health in order to be accepted and also the swan same thing. I could not have the fat sucked out of me. How scary is that? No its all about doing it myself and possibly failing at it. Truth being told...I don't want to be huge and in a wheelchair in 20 years or possibly sooner. This condition could disable me at&nbsp;any time. Why Lie? Being realistic has kept me sane.&nbsp; someone up there likes me. ;) so far so good.&nbsp;      &nbsp;lets switch subjects here just a bit ok.    As for being a BBW for those who don't know what that means, it is a Big Beautiful Woman&nbsp; I'm not really feeling the whole BMW oops...BBW movement? Serious! Yes its great that there are men who like us sisters of size and I commend those who are true gentlemen and admirers of BBW"S. (this is by no means a insult to you.)&nbsp;But lately what I have encountered are certain types who seek out a plus size woman with the intentions of bedding her and only bedding her, Not getting to know her first...Its all about making pit stops till the next unassuming woman comes their way. &nbsp;I myself feel nauseated at the recent encounter I had with one such individual&nbsp;this past week,&nbsp;&nbsp;He seemed nice &nbsp;enough we exchanged numbers.&nbsp;actually he gave me his number (thank god) &nbsp;and 10 minutes into the&nbsp;conversation he was rude and disgusting. Here is a tidbit of what was said...     Guy>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So your a big woman huh?   &nbsp;  D.D.&nbsp;&nbsp;>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes I am...Why do you ask?

      I am Sad Sad Sad...SAD! friggin audio is not working! I am so not in the mood to type because I have been working on my story outside of my blog and it is exhausting right now. I have left like 3 or 4 blogs ? Nowhere in site! I am doing ok. Just working a lot on writing my story and studying as well...It is so much easier to do audio blog instead of actually getting on computer and doing it. Ugh! I am going to smudge my house in the morning with sage to get rid of any negative energy I am feeling lately, I have done it in the past and it has helped. Till next time this is  Dear  Diana signing off,  Peace

      Dear Diana, I am feeling a little frustrated ...Where the heck are my audio blogs? Hello! I am so not into typing...I like my audio blogging more! I have been writing on and off most of the weekend at least 2 hours a day. Feeling a little more comfortable with it. My dad is getting along so much better now, my mom said its as if he is a new person he is walking and doing his therapy faithfully. He also promised me he was going to get a hearing aide so in case my mom needs him for anything he will be able to hear her. He is less stubborn since his surgery. I am so glad he is ok. My mom she is doing good as well...She might have felt a little left out because my father was getting so much attention when he was in the hospital and all. I look forward to him and her getting out more now that he is going to be able to get around without the pain. Till next time, Dear Diana
