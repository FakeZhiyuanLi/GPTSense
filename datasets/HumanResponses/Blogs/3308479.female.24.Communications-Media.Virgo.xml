      My mother and I had an interesting conversation a few weeks ago. We started talking about integration. It is largely debated that things might have been better off left in segregation. Many Black people are beginning to think that we were making better progress as a community back then than we are now. This is actually not up for debate. The Black community was being discriminated against, but they were thriving in their segregation. Blacks had no choice but to have their own neighborhoods and businesses. All their money was going back into their community. Rich Blacks had to live among poor Blacks. There was no moving to a "better" neighborhood. In an effort to "keep up with the Jones's" the factory worker was made to keep his home as nice as the teacher, nurse, or doctor. This kept neighborhoods looking nice so everybody could have a healthy property value. The middle/upperclass Blacks were up close, living examples of success for the poor Blacks. Children would grow up saying, "I want to be like Mr. Johnson." That dream fueled their ambitions and encouraged success. Well-off families were friends with lower income families. There kids were friends. They shared everything. People were being influenced by realistic role models.   Now all the middle/upperclass blacks move to predominantly White neighborhoods. Either that, or they're segregated in communities modeled only for other Blacks in their financial bracket. All the poor Blacks are in ghettos and projects. This breeds hatred and jealousy, which perpetuates bulglary and violence. It is no surprise that the high crime rates in the ghetto are Black on Black. These people have no realistic role models and feel desperate. Their only examples of people who echo their lives are the Shaun Carters (Jay-Z) and Curtis Jacksons (50 Cent) of the world. Gangsta rappers, though only through a television screen, are real living role models for Black youths in the ghetto. It's not like Britney Spears or Justin Timberlake, who grew up middleclass and were sent off to Mickey Mouse Achievement camps as children and reared only to succeed at stardom. For children in the ghetto, gangsta rappers are people who were just like them; the only difference is now they're rich. They were born in the hood, raised in the hood, endured poor public education, probably dropped out of school to hustle, eventually saved enough money to buy some music equipment, began rapping, and made it to the top. This is the only option in the mind of a child in the ghetto because there is simply no other example in their life.  My father had a do-wop group in his teens. When I asked him why they didn't "make it," he laughed and said, "Back then everybody was in a group." Just like groups in the fifties, nearly every young Black man, and some women, in the ghetto are aspiring rap artists. However, everybody can't make it to the top. Everybody can't be Chingy. Out of all the musicians signed under a record label, only about 7% record a hit. That statistic alone should inform you that most of those young wannabe rappers will never make it out of the hood. So, what happens to them? What do they do in the meantime? Where are they supposed to go? How do they make their rent? They probably don't even have a highschool diploma. They dealt drugs as a means to become a rapper because that's the avenue that 50 Cent and Jay-Z told them would work. They look to their left and right, but there aren't any teachers, nurses, or doctors around to tell them about their options. Their neighbors, friends, brothers, cousins, uncles, and fathers are dead, incarcerated, hustling, or working overtime at $6.15 an hour. The "good life" seems worlds away and so far rap hasn't gotten them anywhere. Most of them will turn back toward dealing drugs. Either that, or bulglary, gangs, and scams. Most of them will go to jail or die in the same ghetto they were trying to escape. The handful who manage to make it out by rapping continue the cycle by promoting violence and promiscuity in their music and videos.  I explained this to my mother. I also told her that I thought hiphop would die in ten years if somebody didn't severely change the game. Hiphop used to be fun. It used to be about making beats and rhymes. It used to be about music and dancing. It used to be simple. And like any creative vessel, it had the power to send a message to people. Dr. Dre started gangstadom with the harshness of N.W.A. He continued with Snoop at his side as Notorious B.I.G. was emerging. Then began the notorious fued between east and west coast rap. Suddenly rap music and hiphop had seperated. Rap was going mainstream, but hiphop was getting lost in the hype. Rap was about being poor and becoming powerful. It was about having others fear you as you sipped champagne and smoked weed on your yacht, accompanied by women clad in bikinis. Rap was becoming a fantasy of guns, gangs, nice cars, sex, drugs, money, fortune, and fame; with the occassional ode to the hood. Emcees like KRS-1, Big Daddy Kane, Rakim, Nas, and Mos Def were getting lost; only to remain heard by the ears of their most dedicated fans. It was all about Biggie, Tupac, Snoop, Dre, and Lil Kim. Eventhough positive acts like Arrested Development and The Fugees were admired, critically acclaimed, and adored, they still fell second place behind the exploitation of  money, drugs, violence, greed, and revenge.   The east/west coast fued escalated and two kings of rap, Biggie and Tupac, were murdered. Dre and Snoop kind of fell behind the scenes, as they should have. They wouldn't truly reemerge until many years later, refreshed and focused once again on music.  It was a sad time for hiphop. Honestly, it was a sad time for rap also, despite how it seemed to thrive off of violence, crime, and death. People called a truce over the east versus west thing. New York was looking for a new king. It was a time where hiphop could have been rejuvinated had the right person, with the right message, just stepped forward. Instead, Jay-Z stepped up to the plate. He reintroduced us to drugs, violence, and ghetto-living, along with even heavier hedonistic indulgences. Instead of being a drug dealer, he was more or less a retired hustler. Jay-Z was a self-proclaimed expert emcee with a weakness for promiscuity, Cristal, "bling," "wipes," money, and power. Sometimes it seemed as though he was hitting us over the head with his male prowess. He used his songs and videos to brag about his glory days as a hustler and his current womanizer status. It wasn't until 'The Gift and the Curse' that Jay-Z calmed down, but by then too many ambums had sold and new rappers had emerged using the Jay-Z formula: Hook up with a good producer, get a "magic" track, rap only about money, sex, and drugs. You couldn't turn on the radio, BET, or even MTV without hearing the same tired rap story. All creativity had been chocked. Rap had become stagnant, and quite frankly, it was corny.  Let me just say, I am a Jay-Z fan. But I must be honest when I say that he started it. Obviously it's not his fault that nearly everybody else chose to follow his lead, but I wonder what could have been if there was no lead to follow. Ms. Hill tried. She even succeeded. Who didn't adore 'The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill'? Even if there existed this duality between hiphop and rap, at least the public knew where its options laid. But after Ms. Hill's Grammy award winning album fans waited for her next inspirational move. We're still waiting. While waiting for Lauryn, Jay-Z flourished. He and Damon Dash built their empire with Freeway, Memphis Bleek, Cameron, Juelz Santana...Is that it? Sorry, but I really don't listen to them. Why? Because it's all the same: grew up in the hood, dealt drugs, made money, possibly killed some people, became a rapper, now I make more money. Maybe once or twice, but four, five, six rappers all talking about the same exact thing? No thanks. I'm not even from the hood, never dealt drugs or killed people, and have certainly never had money. Where's my brooding role model?  I didn't particularly like Jay-Z until two things came to my attention. (1) He doesn't write his raps ahead of time. He just lays them down in the studio off the top of his head. This is actually quite genious! (2) I listened to 'The Black Album.' This album encapsulates Jay-Z's entire career, his every intention and motive. You don't have to like a drop of rap to admire the things going on in this cat's head. But we'll get to that later.  Back on task: Jay-Z steps up as the new king of New York. But wait - Nas thought he had the throne. So they battle it out. No big deal. Anyway, a little bit after Jay-Z's mainstream endeavors, Snoop is back on the scene, as well as Dre, only now Dre's got a new sidekick called Eminem. Eminem becomes the best and most popular rapper of all time. Eminem starts his own label under Aftermath, called Shady Records. Under Shady, Eminem signs 50 Cent. This begins the demise of rap music.

      Hiphop is in a state of chaos, people! I kind of always knew that, but ignored it when I was introduced to a new song with killer beats and a monster hook. Recently though, something has really got my mind marinating on some major happenings. I give hiphop another ten years before its demise unless new artists seriously reconstruct this game.   I was having trouble with this Eminem thing. For those of you who aren't privy, Eminem was accused of being racist. The accusation was mostly given by Source magazine co-owner and wannabe-rapper, Benzino. This was a long time coming, because apparently, Benzino had problems with Eminem ever since he became a mainstream act. This just happened to be the first time he had some kind of evidence backing up his claims.   Long before Eminem was with D-12, he was with some another rap group which consisted only of White men. He was in his teens to early twenties at the time. The group recorded a song called 'Foolish Pride' where Eminem is rapping about the pros of dating White women and the cons of dating Black women. He accused Black women of being gold-diggers and repeatedly mentioned White women as "good" and Black women as "bad." A recording of the song got released. People were playing parts of it on the radio and the song was sold on many mixtapes. It seemed as though Benzino may have not fallen completely off the mark. But the racist hype quickly died. Mostly because Benzino doesn't have nearly as much respect in the rap community as Eminem.  Now, as many of those who know me are aware, I simply adore Eminem. Being a writer/poet myself, I can't deny his skills as a lyricist. His use of metaphor and grasp of Standard American English is outstanding. His rhythms, the complexity of his rhyme patterns, styles, cadences, and syllable positioning are beyond debate. You can't compare him to anybody else in the rap game at this time. There are other impressive rappers out there, but Eminem's mastery with words has no parallel.  I had a definite problem with the whole racist accusation. I was straight up confused. What was his motive? What did this mean for hiphop? I had heard all the hype, but hadn't heard any defense from Eminem. I felt as though he didn't care what the Black community thought because he knew his fanbase was largely White. Black folks buy the bootlegs, but the White kids were the ones buying his albums and going to his concerts. They were putting money in his pocket; not us. So, shit, why should he care?  I was at the mall one day and there was a vendor selling bootlegs. He had a mixtape with 'Foolish Pride' on it. I listened to the song and almost fell over with laughter. The song is a heart-attack-serious joke! It's horrible! You could tell these were the rantings of a child. The rhymes were sloppy and the melody was bleak. Nothing about this song seemed comparable to the Eminem we know today. I had to let it go.  I didn't let it go because the song was acceptable. I let it go because it taught me a very valuable lesson. Somewhere along the line I forgot that Eminem is White. That, or I somehow began to believe that he was above such commentary. When we're young, we all say stupid, ill-informed things. You're going to tell me that none of my Caucasian friends ever made a negative comment about Negroids when in their own company? Hell, they made enough ignorant comments right in front of my face! But, you know what? They forgot I'm Black! They felt so comfortable with me that I was considered "different." I know this because these are things I've actually been told. "I don't consider you Black," "But you're not like that, you're different," "I know you're not going to beat me over the head with a baseball bat for no reason." The last quote was seriously said straight to my face; his arm around my shoulder. The comment is definitely offensive, but the point is: people do it.   Can I call them racist? Probably at the time. Maybe, maybe not. It's hard to say when they're your friends. I admit to telling a great many jokes/cracks exploiting White stereotypes. Am I racist? We're all dumbasses sometimes, especially if we think we're in a safe place. That's what the nineteen-year-old M&M was thinking. Is it fair to hold a thirty-something-year-old man accountable for the ill-mannered things spewed in his teens?  My biggest reason for overlooking 'Foolish Pride' was probably based on the mere fact that I don't know Marshall Mathers in the least. All I do know is that I admire Eminem as an artist. I wanted to be able to listen to his music and still respect myself. You don't have to agree with people personally in order to enjoy their creativity. So, like most R. Kelly fans, I turned the other check. I decided to mind my own business when it came to Eminem's mind, motives, and actions.
