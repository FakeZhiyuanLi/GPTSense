       You know what, it takes only forty-three muscles for me to frown and only seventeen muscles for me to smile, and it takes an mere six muscles for me to reach over and bitch slap you.  
  
  
 Sorry, something I just learned and I thought I should share.

       Hey, two entries in one day, wow, that's a first. Okay, so I just got an E-mail from Kita, from Amy, if that made any sense then good for you. Anyways, she's got her own little blog thingy I guess, looking at the site she included in her letter. I have no idea if I should look at it or not. Again my head, the one containing my 'thinking' brain, tells me one thing and my heart screams another. WTF should I do!?! God help me. I don't think I'm gonna look, part of me thinks there's more bad in it than good, and I'll learn more bad things about myself from her than I already know. I think I just blew a couple braincells cause suddenly my head hurts. Oh, well. I'm still not sure what to do about Lauren. again my Head(thinker) and Heart are screaming different things. Kinda like the angel/devil on the shoulder thing. I really can't wait for school to start. Seriously, and I can't beleive I just said that. I wish I were a bear. One of those ones that those "manly guys" hunts with a big gun. Then all I'd ever have to worry about would be eating, sleeping, and being in the wrong place at the right time so I can get shot. Oh how fun. I'm still tired, and I have no clue why i just can't go to sleep. I tried about an hour ago. Do I still have feelings for her........no, I couldn't,..........could I? ( god, would you please cast downa stone and be sure it hits me in the FREAKIN HEAD!!! )

       Okay, so I haven't written in a while, been kinda busy. Yesterday, I got an E-mail from Lauren. She was actually apologizing to me for the way things turned out and she said she still loves me and thinks about me all the time. I really dunno what the explitive (sorry I'm trying to cut back on my insane amount of cussing) I should do. Markita's got her own problems and I'd rather not inconvienice her with my own. Amy hates my guts, so I can't turn to her. I think it bothers Crystal in a way when I bring up my relationships. And my parents. Hahahahahaha. Sorry, that's just funny. I really don't have anyone but myself to ask for help this time. Bound to happen sooner or later. Got a lot on my plate this year. Freakin ROTC, and being a senior, and stayin away from my dad so when he says something wrong to me, the first thing I don't do is bloody his face, and so much more. My whole family gets on my nerves. And no, its not a stage in my life, i'll never get along with any of them, never have, never will. If you can't count on your friends and you can't count on your family, then you shouldn't count on yourself, everythings less disappointing that way.   I hope Kita's not reaching fot that stupid razor. I worry about her. I probably shouldn't so much cause she's not my Girlfriend, and she doesn't consider me a friend, but to me, she's one of the few friends i've got and well I went through a lot with her and its instilled some hardened feelings for her. (Sigh) And so does Sergio her boyfriend, well ex now, but still. I'm so confused. I have no idea what I should do about my life. Why does Lauren love me, I'm not even remotely near good-looking, let alone, dare I say, average. I'm a crappy boyfriend. I don't have anything to offer her now or in the future. I'm not rich. I'm not good at much, other than military stuff, which is the only damn thing in the world that seems to come natural to me. Well that and vid games like Halo, and Hitman. That doesn't leave much room to make her as happy as I think she should be. All I seem to be good at is pain and destruction. Its subconciously easy for me. Its all I seem to do. Look at Markita, I'm partly to blame for the cuts and scars she's got on her wrists. I hurt Lauren, the only person, other than Kita, whose made me feel happy and complete. Yea I'm still young and got a lot of crap ahead of me but I know what Love is. I just don't see Lauren's attraction to me. Or anyone else's for that matter. Well except Amy's, she just wanted to get fucked. Another thing I'm seemingly not good at. What a waste of life. I know i've probably got it better than half of the guys my age on this planet, but still, I kinda wish I could trade bodies with some homeless kid with AIDS in Africa. I'm babbling aren't I. Oh, well. Guess I should go, I feel kinda tired. Haven't been sleeping well for about well since Lauren,..........nevermind.

        Okay last night I had a little "fun", just to get my mind off Lauren and the rest of my fucked up life. Excuse my bad language. Actually I shoulda said I talked to Crystal for a few hours before my "fun". Its always great to hear from her and even if i'm in the worst of moods she always seems to get me to smile or at least cheer up a little. Amy's b-day was yesterday. So if you ever see this Amy, Happy Birthday. It kinda came up in the phone call I was having with Crystal. What's wrong with me. I'm still not over any of them. I just lost Lauren and that hurts like hell. I still feel something towards Markita, not very strong feelings but somethings still there. And everytime Amy's brought up, my heart drops a little. Damn. I've got to get over her. A few days ago I got into a huge arguement with my parents, and given that my father and I don't much get along, and how angry and somewhat depressed I was, I ended up punching a solid concrete slab outside of our house. The first time it kinda hurt but the next ten or twenty I didn't feel much until I heard a crack and a loud "pop". Now my freakin right hand is swollen to an insane size, I personally have only seen a bigger hand on a Gorilla at the zoo. My left is the one that went "pop" its knuckles are only slightly red. And the crack came from the concrete breaking. Not cool. I'm gonna get in trouble for that, just a matter of time. I got ROTC in a few days so i'm sorta nervous about that. I'm gonna be an Officer. Wow. More responsibility in my already busy life. LOL! Yea right. Ahh.... maybe ROTC will keep me to busy to continue my "love life". I'll be on like three teams and still have all those stupid senior duties, and also focus on graduating. I'm freakin hungry. Lets go eat.

       Picking up where I left off................  
  &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; 
 As I mentioned before, I'd just met four people in less than a week that would all change my life. The first would be Crystal, she's&nbsp;my Best Friend and I hope she always will be. I guess its possible that one day&nbsp;she&nbsp;and I, will be more, I doubt it. She's always been there for me and well its great to know that you have at least one person in the world to count on. For a time she liked me as more than "just friends" but I kinda fixed that by dating one of her friends. That friend would be Amy. Amy's blonde, really hot, and she's really good at passing herself off as a "church girl". Something I go for, you know the good "girl type".&nbsp;Anyways, I asked her out at a friends party, I'd had a few drinks and wasn't drunk, but....... I guess I'd call it "tipsy".&nbsp;She said yes and we started dating. My birthday rolled around a few weeks later. By then we'd already kinda figuered each other out, or so i'd thought. Unfortunately, Amy had some friends that were also interested in me, for the life of me I still haven't figured out why. Amy and I had gotten into a stupid fight and broke up, just before our ROTC Christmas Party. I'd already fallen pretty hard for Amy, and seeing her around another guy about an hour later both hurt me and pissed me off. So I got over it, in a few hours. During that party her friend Markita and I ended up hooked up. another great girl. Unfortunately, I was still just a "boy" when it came to understanding women and love. A lot of fights, heartache and a few tears later,&nbsp;Markita and I&nbsp;broke up, what's worse was it was her birthday. I'm a jackass, I know. A week later, I ended hooking back up with Amy. Only this time it was different. I was still in "love" with Markita, and I was really falling for Amy the more I stayed around her. Well being that I was already dating Amy&nbsp;I stuck with her, hoping against hope that I would get over Markita. I really thought me and Amy would go far together. Not far as in sex, but as in the our lives. She seemed to be the perfect person for me. I got stupid. She invited me to her house, nobody home, to "spend some time together". I didn't expect to end up having sex with her so I didn't take a rubber. I didn't "perform" to well, and no i'm not making excuses for myself, mostly due to the fact that I was nervous and kinda scared. When we went back to school, Amy had totally changed, she was very stand-offish, and stuff. This continued for nearly a week when my parents pretty much screwed me over by moving me Albuquerque, N.M.. If you don't know where that is don't feel bad, we'll just say its a big city built in a hole surrounded by mountains. Amy broke up with me, before I left on the grounds that she'd been in long distance relationships before and they don't work. That hurt a lot and I actually considered going sui, just to make the pain go away. A week later, my friend calls and tells me Amy's talking mad shit about me and she's already found herslef a new boyfriend. Ever felt your heart drop? Mine dropped so far and hard, I think it busted a new mountain in China. A week after that, another one of Amy's friends, Lauren, called me up and well i ended up asking her out. I found out more about both Markita and Amy. Amy had lied to me the entire time we went out, and markita had cheated on me with six guys.I didn't know what to think I just knew that the greater part of me was over them for good. I found out that Amy said she'd only gone out with me so Markita wouldn't get her way and be with me. I found out loads and loads of things about them. After a week&nbsp;Lauren told me she loved me. No girl in my entire life has ever said it first, nor meant it as much as she did. A while later, bout a month I think, being the stupid ass that I am, I ended up listening to people in El Paso and broke up with her for supposed cheating. We ended up fixing our little problem and I fell even harder for this girl. Then I found myself looking back on my past relationships and realizing that after all this time, all the heartache, pain and few tears, I'd found a girl who made me happy. I felt complete. I found myself lackin certain aspects of "being a good Boyfriend". I'd never been in a relationship where I felt this much for anyone. I had just found real "love" and it was new. For once I really didn't know what to do.&nbsp;And again in my infinite wisdom, I opened my mouth and said some bad things to her after&nbsp;Lauren just came out and told me she'd be gone for a month. No explination. I didn't know how to react so I did what I promised her I wouldn't and jumped straight to conclusions. I felt instantly bad after I said what I said and turned to the only people I knew could help. My exgirlfriends. I explained as much as I could to them in hopes they could help me. Markita was the only one who wrote me back and tried to help. She told me what&nbsp;I could try&nbsp;to be a better boyfriend. I also found out from her I was the cause if a lot of her pain. She cuts herself to ease her emotional pain and for her it works. I feel really bad for causing someone the same pain I promised myself I'd never inflict on anyone. I know that kinda pain. Every girlfriend in my life has hurt me in some way or another except Markita and Lauren. I found out I was the one who'd hrt on Markita. Then yesterday, Lauren broke up with me. I've never felt pain like that. I'd rather take a harpoon to the chest than feel that pain again. Again the suicide thought have penetrated my thoughts. I found my punching bag does no good to releave my pain or anger and neither does Kita's way. Yea I tried it. It helped for a few seconds. Then I had to do it again. And again. So I got up went outside and went running. I was so lost in my thoughts I didn't notice it had started raining and there was a horrible pain in my lungs and sides. Ironic how it rains when I need it to. I love the rain. Especially if I feel bad. Then out of God's&nbsp;limitless irony I found myself near a bridge, in the rain. I just kinda sat on the edge of that bridge and closed my eyes. I felt calm, and somewhat refreshed. My right wrist kinda stung from the rain on my cuts and my wristband was soaked, as were the rest of my clothes. On my left wrist, tightly wrapped around it was the bracelet Crystal gave me. Kinda weird. I felt as if she were there with me.  
  &nbsp; 
 Obviously I'm still here, with another chapter in the "Meaning of Life." I'll move on, if not slowly. I left out lots of stuff in the above experience, mostly due to the fact that if I didn't it would take me about a week to write it all. Yet again, my veiw on life has changed. As has the value of my friends, and the nature in which I love, and place my trust. I must say Thanks to Crystal and Markita, both for helping me with the comlexities of life and for giving me yet another place to write and express my emotions and thoughts.

         This wasn't my idea. I got it from a friend. Markita.&nbsp;I don't know how or why things go the way they do. I just know lifes not fair sometimes. I'm only seventeen and I already know more about what i'll call "The Facts of Life" than most people. I'll list them sometime. Anyways, today I got lots of news, some good, some bad, and some just kinda made me think twice about my life and the actions&nbsp;I take. I'm not one of those guys that girls take a second look at. Nor am I the most popular person in school. In fact, I don't have many friends, (I can count them on one hand).&nbsp;Those that I do have, I take seriously and will do anything, well  almost  anything, for them.     During the past year though, my whole concept of&nbsp;"Love" and&nbsp;"Friendship" has utterly changed. I started&nbsp;my junior year&nbsp;at J.M. Hanks&nbsp;High School&nbsp;with many things going for me. I just got promoted to&nbsp;platoon sergent in ROTC. I had&nbsp;plenty of friends. Lots of relationship interests. Ahead of required class credits to&nbsp;graduate. I had never used drugs.&nbsp;I respected my parents as much as possible. And most of all&nbsp;I still had my virginity, something I promised myself I wouldn't lose til I was married. Everything went well for the first&nbsp;month of school, my grades looked good, I was doin a great job in ROTC and still mananging to have fun with my&nbsp;friends. then I met four special people. All would have thier own impacts on my life.

       Why do I find myself feeling like I miss Amy, again. WTF is wrong with me. I swear, I've had 5 damned girlfriends since she decided she didn't wanna be with me anymore, all 5 were very attractive, all 5 were totally into ME of all people. And two of them I could of screwed. Not that thats my goal in life, but still. None of them, except Lauren, made me even remotely happy. That and the fact that I've been stupid enough to risk destroying the almost perfect relationship with my Best Friend on account that I thought it would be a good idea to ask her out. Shit, I wish things weren't so freakin complicated. I still feel love for Amy, I feel bad about what happened with Lauren, she did make me really happy, and for a while there I actually started to get my hopes up that she was the one, something I should'a learned after my heart got shattered into peices small enough to thread through a needle by Amy. I'm over Markita totally and have been for a long time, but I find myself caring about her, as if she were my little sister. Which is even more weird cause I don't even worry about my biological sisters that way. I've slowed my cussing though, that's the only good thing. Geeze, I should be shot.

       Today was my second freakin boring ass day of High School. Okay maybe it wasn't all that bad. I met this new girl names Cyndi in my third period class. She's very hot. And she's pretty much the type of girl I would go for, other than the fact that she smokes. But to be honest I don't really have a problem with that. I freakin grew up with smokers. Well that, and the fact that her best friends a guy, and he's lack, and she likes him. But he don't feel the same. See how easy it is for people to just open up to me. My government class is actually fun. The teacher is freakin cool. Mr. Fouser, I think that's his name. ROTC's okay, I really miss my U.S. Army ROTC though. It was a lot better than Del Norte High School's ROTC. Alright well I don't have much else to say, guess we'll see what happens tomarrow.

        Throughout my life, I have never seen these things that we have all experienced in one form or another put so succinctly as you see them below:
  


    No matter how much I care, some people just don't care back.       It takes years to build up trust, and only seconds to destroy it.       It's not what you have in your life but who you have in your life that counts.       You shouldn't compare yourself to the best others can do but to the best you can do.      It's not what happens to people that's important. It's what they do about it.       You can do something in an instant that will give you heartache for life.       No matter how thin you slice it, there are always two sides.       It's taking me a long time to become the person I want to be.       It's a lot easier to react than it is to think.       You should always leave loved ones with loving words. It may be the last time you see them.       You can keep going long after you think you can't.       We are responsible for what we do, no matter how we feel.       Either you control your attitude or it controls you.       Heroes are the people who do what has to be done when it needs to be done, regardless of the consequences.       Learning to forgive takes practice.       There are people who love you dearly, but just don't know how to show it.       My best friend and I can do anything or nothing and have the best time.       Sometimes the people you expect to kick you when you're down will be the ones to help you get back up.       Sometimes when I'm angry I have the right to be angry, but that doesn't give me the right to be cruel.       True friendship continues to grow, even over the longest distance.       Maturity has more to do with what types of experiences you've had and what you've learned from them and less to do with how many birthdays you've celebrated.       You should never tell a child their dreams are unlikely or outlandish.   Few things are more humiliating, and what a tragedy it would be if they believed it.       No matter how good a friend is, they're going to hurt you every once in a while and you must forgive them for that.       It isn't always enough to be forgiven by others. Sometimes you have to learn to forgive yourself.       Our background and circumstances may have influenced who we are, but we are responsible for who we become.       Sometimes when my friends fight, I'm forced to choose sides even when I don't want to.       Just because two people argue, it doesn't mean they don't love each other. And just because they don't argue, it doesn't mean they do.       Sometimes you have to put the individual ahead of their actions.       We don't have to change friends if we understand that friends change.       You shouldn't be so eager to find out a secret. It could change your life forever.       Two people can look at the exact same thing and see something totally different.       No matter how you try to protect your children, they will eventually get hurt and you will hurt in the process.       No matter the consequences, those who are honest with themselves get farther in life.       Your life can be changed in a matter of seconds by people who don't even know you.       Even when you think you have no more to give, when a friend cries out to you, you will find the strength to help.       The people you care most about in life are taken from you too soon.       It's hard to determine where to draw the line between being nice and not hurting people's feelings and standing up for what you believe.      Life is like a roll of toilet paper. The closer it gets to the end, the faster it goes.      We should be glad God doesn't give us everything we ask for.      Money doesn't buy class.      It's those small daily happenings that make life so spectacular.      Under everyone's hard shell is someone who wants to be appreciated and loved.      The Lord didn't do it all in one day. What makes you think I can?      To ignore the facts does not change them.      When you plan to get even with someone, you are only letting that person continue to hurt you.      Love, not time, heals all wounds.      The easiest way for me to grow as a person is to surround myself with people smarter than I am.      Everyone you meet deserves to be greeted with a smile.      There's nothing sweeter than sleeping with your one true love and feeling their breath on your cheeks.      No one is perfect until you fall in love with them.      Life is tough, but I'm tougher.      Opportunities are never lost; someone will take the ones you miss.      When you harbor bitterness, happiness will dock elsewhere.      I wish I could have told those I cared about that I love them one more time before they passed away.      One should keep his words both soft and tender, because tomorrow he may have to eat them.      A smile is an inexpensive way to improve your looks.      I can't choose how I feel, but I can choose what I do about it.      When a newly born child holds your finger in his little fist, its then that you know your hooked for life.      Everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all the happiness and growth occurs while you're climbing it.      It is best to give advice in only two circumstances; when it is requested and when it is a life threatening situation.      The less time I have to work with, the more things I get done.      The mind is like a parachute, it works best when its open.      Create like a God, Command like a King, Work like a Slave.      To ignore the past is to solicit disrespect. To ignore the present is to invite laziness. To ignore the future is to beg for disaster.         Thanks Crystal and Priscilla for more additions  to my ever growing list.     I'll add more as I think of or experience them.

       Dude, why can't I just ask her? Everytime I try to ask Crystal out I freeze up. I haven't been this nervous or scared of a girl since the 6th freakin grade. Ahh....I guess eventually I'll get up the courage to just say it. My first day of school is tommarrow. I guess thats good. Its basically a new school, well I was only there for two weeks before summer vacation started, so its still new. I'm a Second Lt. in ROTC for now, and I still have no Idea what I'm going to do there. I have ROTC first period so that's good, oh and this year, well no, until December 23, I get out of school at 1:30, then after that I get out at 12:30. How cool. I'm taking ROTC, Pre-Cal / Cal / Trig, English 12, Government / Economics, then Speech in that order. I know i'll graduate the only thing that bothers me is getting into college, and what i'm going to do with my life after high school and college. I could just join the Marines or Army. But that wouldn't leave a lot of time or room for Crystal or anyone else, if there's anyone that cares and if Crystal and I do move on to a new place in our relationship, and if it were to last that long. So many things to do, so little time to do them. I went shopping yesterday and got lots of new clothes. So I guess that's cool. Then I spent some time with my Dad, something that rarely happens. It was good and all, but it just goes to prove to me that neither one of us has a lot to say to the other. We can barely keep up small talk. Hey, at least we haven't had a boxing match in about 4 months. That's good. I actually slept like a baby after I talked to Crystal last night. Another rarity for me. I actually had dreams that weren't all bad for once. I'm probably going to get a job after school to about 10 or 11. Help keep me out of trouble and away from people. I wish I was back home. As much as El Paso sucked ass, its been home for the greater majority of my life. I had so many life experiences there that its just kinda hard to let go. Besides I think Albuquerque sucks more than anywhere I've been so far. That, and well I'd be close to Crystal. That would make things a lot better. My mom said that if I want to for my birthday, she'll buy me a bus or plane ticket back home and I can do what I want from there. Kinda considering that. I'd be back home, with friends, back into an Army ROTC and........ with Crystal. Now there's something to contemplate.

       I guess I don't really have much to complain about today. Everythings going pretty well, I guess. I'm still kinda confused about my feelings. Well, no, not confused, just a little afraid of what these feelings might mean. I have to get over Lauren soon cause its driving me insane, and I'm not gonna wait for her to like me again. I'm not a firm beleiver in the whole "If you love something let it go, if it comes back it was yours" thing. It doesn't work, and even if it managed to, life's got complications that make it impossible. Priscilla says me and Crystal are bound to end up together at some point in our lives as more than just friends. Which I have no huge propblem with, I like her and she's my Best Friend. She knows me better than I think I know myself. Kinda scary but I like that. I know without a doubt that she won't lie to me or cheat on me. And she's been the shoulder I could 'cry' on for a long time, well it has been to me. She's just been the answer to a lot of questions, wants and needs in my life. Yet there's a part of me that thinks taking my 'friendship' with Crystal to something else, is not a smart thing to do. I just broke up with Lauren three weeks ago. I have a bad habit of moving on really quick like to ease my pain, i.e. Amy to Markita in less than 6 hours, then Markita to Amy in a day, then Amy to Markita in a matter of hours, then from Markita to Jackie's bed, back to Amy, then,....okay, you get the basic picture. I think I'll just wait a few more weeks, or until I'm sure its 'safe' for me to move on, and know that I'm over Lauren, and well, to be honest, Markita and Amy too. We'll see what happens. PIZZA! YAY! Oh, yea, I got a whole two boxes of pizza to myself. Kinda weird, I'm not fat or chunky, I weigh 135 lbs, and I'm fairly slim, yet I can eat and eat. Stupid Extremely High Metabolizm!

       I ended up talking to Priscilla last night on the phone. I like talking to her. She understands where I'm coming from on pretty much everything. So that's cool. Anyways she told me that since Lauren's moving on then I should too. Shawna's here and she likes me a lot, so that helps I guess. Then today she told me some stuff about Crystal that made me feel even happier. So today was the absolute best day I've had in nearly a month and a half. That and I feel good. I don't feel sick, I stopped having dreams about the people I love or care most about dying before my eyes because of me, and the fact that I'm beggining to return to my normal, happy/quiet/don't mess with me or i'll kill you, self. Which is good, cause, well I'm not sure why, it just is. Oh that and my freakin appetite is back from where ever it went and is making me wanna consume all the food in the house.So for now, life seems like it might get better, but I've learned not to get my hopes up about anything. I haven't talked to Markita in a while and she hasn't written her blog thing in a few days, hope she's okay, though with her its probably nothing and she's just so busy with school, ROTC, her band, and maybe a boyfriend, that she's lacking the time to do things. I read Amy's blog thing and its nice to know she at least apologized to me for, well I'm not sure she knows what, and that she's also getting along so well with life. I got a few written letters from Crystal, that i have to write her back for. Hold on the stupid door bells ringing........Okay, so I just got done talking to Shawna. She wanted to talk a bit. Then she told me to go to her house tomarrow so we can 'hang out'. Yea,...right. Nah, I won't--, we won't do anything. All we'll probably do is sit there on her freakin couch under a freakin blanket and watch some movie I don't even like. Oh well, its the price I pay for being a guy. Shawna's cool. I mean her parents are kinda strict, and her whole family is "church goin folk". She's got the whole "church-girl"   thing with her. She told me she's had 5 boyfriends, but she's never made out with a guy. I met her parents at Military Ball, and they told her later that they liked me, which she then told me. Which is a bonus, I guess. I dunno though, I think I'd rather keep a friendly relationship with her and not pursue anything else. Kinda hard when she's tried to kiss you three times. Okay, well I better get goin, I'm cooking, yea, proabaly not a "manly" thing to do, but here's what you can do about it:  G.F.Y!

       Okay, where to start........... I know I'll start from Sunday. I finally realized how much Lauren meant to me and I got up the courage to ask her out again. She told me no cause she says she has to 'grow up". I don't quite buy it. I think she's just using that as cover instead of telling me something that she knows might hurt me. But I really can't do or say anything that would change her mind so I guess I just have to move on. Bringing me to Monday. Boring day, all I really did was sit back and be a freakin bum all day in my PJ's which are just shorts. Anyway's Monday kinda just rolled on and I felt miserable all freakin day till Crystal called. Once again she cheered me up. Always does. Now yesterday, Tuesday, I go to my ROTC thingy in the Manzano Mtns. Its not all work or anything, we got to climb those fake walls which I set a 34 second record on, very cool, pick apples and eat them, very fresh and tasty, and we also got to swim. Well on to my point. Later I was in the pool and this girl Shawna, I still can't spell her name, got in with me. We were just talking and they started playing some music, she swam over to me and we just started dancing in the freakin pool. Super cool, cause she's a uber hottie, like hot enough to make the sun look like a frozen ball of ice. Asian-Hispanic with green eyes that seem to glow sometimes, that perfectly complement her slim light brown body, large breasts, and perfect heart shaped ass. Anyways, I danced with her at Military Ball and she told me then that I was "incredibly hot" and that she really liked me. I told her then wasn't a good time and she completely understood. But yesterday she wrapped her legs around me while we danced and then she asked me out and leaned in to kiss me, I turned away and told her "I can't". I think its cause I still feel bad about Lauren, and cause I feel kinda like I'm cheating on her if I do something. Anyways she blushed and let go of me and left. Her friends told me she went to the girls restroom crying. I felt pretty bad. She called me up last night and said she wanted to talk. So I went and we talked. She asked me out again and I told her "I couldn't yet." And well she started crying again. Right in front of me. She just started telling me hoe she'd never liked anyone this much before and how she has dreams about me, and lots more. I told her she really doesn't want to date me and that well, she'd be better of with someone else, she just shrugged, and said she had to go home and left. I felt really horrible for hurting yet another person. I always have hurt everyone around me. My friend Priscilla says me and Crystal are meant to be, just a matter of when, but she knows it'll happen. I doubt it, and even if she and I were to get close enough to date, well I wouldn't let it happen. She deserves a lot better than me, and well everything her mom went through I don't want to end up putting her through, which knowing myself would happen. I'm just a stupid jerk.   I have so much crap running through my head right now my brain cells are sponatneously exploding. Nobody will shut up about me still having feelings for Amy and Markita. For the last time fuckers, Its feelings of FRIENDSHIP no more, maybe less. I care about them like I would care about any other friend, nothing else.

       I keep asking myself what to do, and receive no answer. I don't know what I could or should do. I can't stop thinking about Lauren, and Amy and Markita are constantly in the afterthoughts of Lauren. I still have some feelings for Amy and Markita, and yet those for Lauren still make me wanna cry. I kinda just lied in bed last night and stared at the roof, oops, ceiling, sorry Crystal I forgot. I got so tired/bored, and I feel so miserable, that I just put on some clothes and a sweater and went for a walk in the rain, which wasn't really rain it was more of a cold drizzle. I just walked and walked, until about 5 in the morning, when I realized how tired I was and how far from home I'd walked. Still drizzling and I was soaking wet. I just walked right back home. Only good thing about Albuquerque that I've found so far, its got lots of walking and bike paths. And well in the morning everything smells fresh. But that only lasts til like 6:30 in the morning. Anyways, I guess writing and walking/running lets me subconsciously sort things out cause I kinda realized a few things. Firstly, Lauren is the only girl that I've ever felt real true love for. She makes me extremely happy, and well I have no right nor reason to doubt her love. I feel kinda lost without her, moreso than ever before. My feelings for Markita, well they're just that feelings, like I said before, we went through a lot together. I care about her a lot, she's one of the few real friends I have and also one of the only people on this planet I can count on. And anything I feel for Amy, well I still can't explain them. Even after all those things she said and did to me, I still care about her just as much as I care about Markita. I know for a fact that I still want to date Lauren, maybe more, not now but someday, when I can take care of her, and make sure she's happy with her life. I just have to ask her out. And hope she still wants me, as bad as I want her.
