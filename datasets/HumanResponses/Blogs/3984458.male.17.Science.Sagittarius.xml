       Ok I am in Wanganui NZ the most random thing ever and explaining what a blog is to this guy with steelo wool hair called Ben Stegman. His brother is good at hockey, the captian infact. Just thought I should tell the world that.

        The Islamic Jihad assholes are now threatening to execute 6 more truck drivers after releasing the Phillipino one. 3 of those are Indian. This is unacceptable. If they are going to execute our civilians, we have no choice but to wipe all their kind from the face of the earth.

          When have mass extinctions occurred, and what kinds of ecological damage resulted?   &nbsp;  Life has been around since the Archean Eon (3.9-2.5byr) when the Earth’s oceans and atmosphere formed. Since then, after life exploded in the Cambrian period, it has been battling the odds to survive. In every major era,     the Paleozoic   ,    the Mesozoic    and the Cenozoic, life has been threatened to die out, but has prevailed. There have been five mass extinctions palaeontologists have come to agree on, where large proportions of earthly life have died out. These are the:  &nbsp;  End Cretaceous Extinction (About 65 million years ago)  The most famous extinction, it destroyed 85% of all species, but was by far not the largest. Interest in this extinction stems from the cause. In 1980, Luis Alvarez controversially suggested a new theory that an asteroid impact could be responsible for the death of the dinosaurs, capturing the interest of the globe. This is the most probable explanation, although there are others. Dinosaurs were among the reptilian species largely affected, but by no means the only group. However, some groups seem to have avoided being scathed by this impact; birds, crocodiles and of course mammals all survived which lead to our own evolution.  &nbsp;  Late Triassic Extinction (About 208 million years ago)  One of the more overlooked extinctions, however one quarter of all life was wiped out, making it comparable to the End Cretaceous extinction. It is still unclear whether this event was two extinctions spaced 12-17myr apart, or a single event. Many species families were lost, and both Conodonts and Labryinthodonts were disappeared, making room for dinosaurs to take over. This was caused by global warming.  &nbsp;  End Permian Extinction (About 245 million years ago),  This was the most devastating extinction ever in the planets history, wiping out 96% of all marine species, while on land three quarters of all vertebrate families became extinct. In fact, for a time it caused fungal species to be the dominant form of terrestrial life. This also did away with the last of the surviving trilobite species. Fluctuations in sea level, differences in ocean salinity or volcanic activity may be the cause for this mass extinction, as always leading to climate change, in this case a global warming.  &nbsp;  Late Devonian Extinction (About 360 million years ago)  Major facts of this extinction still have not been agreed upon; however most information suggests this extinction/series of extinctions took place over about 3 million years. It caused huge damage to biodiversity and killed up to 70% of all species. Marine life suffered most, while freshwater species, land plants and early amphibians did not suffer as badly. The causes for this extinction are not apparent, but are probably due to global cooling as a disproportionate number of warm water species died.  &nbsp;  Late Ordovician Extinction (About 438 million years ago)  The Ordovician period was a relatively stable one, where substantial growth in biodiversity took place. However as the period drew to a close an extinction event occurred, causing some animal groups to loose more than half their species. It seemed to be caused by an ice age, lowering sea levels.   urlLink  Echinoderms   ,   urlLink  trilobites   ,   urlLink  nautioids    and other groups suffered heavily. However, overall the effects were not as great as other extinctions.  &nbsp;  Late Cambrian Extinction (About 500 million years ago)  This period was one of great evolutionary expansion, it appeared that life had taken hold and was in a great experimental phase, where many species were created leading to the main branches in design of animal and plant life from 570-500myr. Most of the animals at this time were soft-bodied creatures, leaving little fossilized records. Therefore the effects of this extinction are not as clear as they normally are. The causes or cause of this extinction are not well known, but there certainly were huge changes in sea level during this time. The trilobites suffered, previously being widespread and dominant. From here their species declined from successive extinctions.  &nbsp;  How do mass extinctions occur, and do their causes still pose a threat?  All the mass extinctions occurred from ever present natural reasons. The next one may be man made and unlikely to ever occur again after our extinction, e.g. a nuclear winter; however the catalysts for previous extinctions are still around. Although it is hard to say, due to incomplete fossil records and accuracy limits on dating, it appears there is a cycle to mass extinctions of 26-30 million years. This has tremendous implications, for it suggests a single cause for extinction. However, there is always going to be more than one cause for mass extinction. In fact there are far too many right now than for me to list. So the following are likely, major causes for extinction that have occurred or may occur in the future. N.B. God, divine, human, extraterrestrial and supernatural causes have been omitted because their categories are too open.  &nbsp;  Biological Collapse  Plants and animals all consume resources, converting them into un-recyclable waste. This can lead to a shortage of resources causing mass extinctions. A plague of parasites/animals may also manage to quickly kill off major links in the food web and collapse it or modify the atmosphere. If it weren’t for plant life, the Earth’s atmosphere would easily have ended up like that of Venus, so life has massive effects on the entire planet.  &nbsp;  Climate Change  Induced by solar events, such as sun spots, large prominences and other changes in solar weather, our weather can change. Cloud formation is dependant to some degree on levels of cosmic radiation received, if this varies, more or less clouds may form lowering or raising the temperature respectively. Any temperature changes or instabilities in ocean currents can cause polar ice caps to enlarge or melt, changing sea levels by several meters. Volcanism is usually a catalyst for this behaviour, and releases many poisonous gases and ash clouds that can cover the planet. Natural cycles of ice ages and heat are shown to occur, so there is no reason why they will not continue to do so. In fact, we are due for a magnetic field flip that occurs regularly for unknown reasons.  &nbsp;  Cosmic Catastrophes  Black holes are unlikely to sneak up on us, but it isn’t impossible that one of our neighbouring super-massive stars collapse and suck us in. Cosmic radiation appears to be a factor that has caused a few extinctions. As we regularly pass through the Milky Way’s spiral arms in the suns orbit around the galactic centre (over many thousands of years), Earth is bombarded by high levels of cosmic radiation from increased numbers of nearby supernovae. This can change the ionosphere dramatically and the radiation is lethal to life, a possible cause of the Permian extinction. Asteroid impact. This is blamed for the demise of the dinosaurs, a six mile long asteroid smacked into the Earth with the force of 100 million tonnes of TNT, making a dust cloud that covered the Earth for about six months blocking sunlight. This isn’t as bad as the collision that hit the early Earth before life came to be, when we collided with an object the size of mars, sending ejected material into high orbit that soon collected and formed the moon. Planetary alignments are a remote cause for concern; however in 2025 all the planets bar Earth will align on one side of the solar system with earth on the other. The resulting gravitational imbalance could alter Earths orbit to more elliptical creating huge weather pattern changes, change the Sun’s short term behaviour, or even nudge some asteroids out of the asteroid belt towards us.  &nbsp;  Death of Sun  As it goes through its main sequence, the sun gets 10% brighter every 10 million years. This will make the surface of the planet uninhabitable long before it expands into a red giant possibly swallowing the Earth, and at least baking it dry and airless. At this point in time Saturn’s moon Titan will become like that of early Earth’s for a period of 1myr, possibly sustaining human life while the only chance for survival, interstellar ark ships, are constructed that can make the journey over thousands of years to other star systems.  &nbsp;  Death of Universe  Ultimately we will all come to an end. The universe will accelerate out from our reach leaving galaxies trillions of light years apart, clusters of dead star cores and cold planets slowly being consumed by central black holes. Any surviving matter will one day sublime into energy as fundamental particles loose their power. The largest of the black holes will finally evaporate leaving an empty universe. Only intelligent life will be able to avoid this fate, but it requires millennia of technological development to create technology powerful enough to save and create life perpetually. It’s unlikely our species will stick around that long and do it.  &nbsp;  If any of these causes for mass extinction were to happen, would we be able to fend them off or escape?  The ability to fend off disaster is quite rare. However, it is possible for us to try and cool the atmosphere in the event of global warming by changing the air chemistry, reflecting sunlight with huge solar sails and deflect/destroy any incoming asteroids. Unfortunately due to current financial and political situations, in practice such attempts would not work at present. The nuclear warheads would take months to prepare and launch, and we have a record of finding high risk asteroids after they’ve passed close to the Earth. Early warning detection and defence systems would cost billions of dollars, and were more likely do die of climate change anyway, like increased volcanism. Manufacturing volumes of gasses and huge high-tech reflectors would cost much more, and deployment is more likely to become a tangled disaster than a micro thin reflective success. Practically, it is extremely hard to prevent the causes of extinction, if not impossible. Try altering the sun’s orbit or stop a supernova for instance. Escape is the best and frequently sole option. Escaping our entire solar system has already been achieved by numerous probes like Pioneer 10 &amp; 11 and Voyager 1 &amp; 2. Developing the plumbing to keep messy humans alive for long durations seems to be our only obstacle to following them.  &nbsp;  Should we fear the causes for mass extinction? By when will we have the technology to become invulnerable to mass extinction, if ever?  According to the cycle theory mentioned in Q2, we are in the middle of the cycle, about 10 million years out. This doesn’t mean we are safe, it means it would be statistically surprising if we suddenly died out without having a fair share of time to live. And surprises happen all the time. It may occur to you that the Earth’s biosphere has never been completely erased; our extinction may make way for the next kind of life. However, it is prudent to note that during the three to four billion year evolution of life, only once has it produced intelligence. This intelligence is a pretty fair shot, not just because it is naturally capable of constructing the environment, space travel, etc. but can engineer its own DNA intuitively which is the next evolutionary step. Direction. It is unlikely to ever happen again. It’s safe to say that it won’t happen again, we appear to have arrived just in the nick of time, as the Earth will loose its capacity for biological regeneration in less than a 100myr thanks to our warming sun. So the engineering ability is important. It will be the final step we take before our demise as humanity is superseded by what we create. Obviously we’ll borrow from the finest evolution in nature to perfect this new machine, which will still be representative of ourselves. But it will be far more efficient, hard and adaptable, opening up the majority of planets for habitation instead of the incredibly few Earth-like ones we may never be able to reach or find. They will take their like wise engineered flora and fauna extending the biosphere of Earth because they can do what we fall short of, evolution will not take us outside the box because we’re adapted to live and inflexible. And they will point up at the stars speaking of the yellow sun and the blue planet, and say it all started there. That is the point when we will have the technology to become as invulnerable as possible to mass extinction, spread right across our galaxy. The technology for this will be perfected within the next five hundred years. Just a bit more know how about genetic engineering, and the materials and habitat sustaining technology to build a ship with an ecosystem that can support generations of people for a few thousand years without breaking down. As for cheating the death of the universe, the technology it currently a theoretical impossibility. Fearing the causes of mass extinction and building defences against it will probably only save us from mass loss of life, as total extinction is very unlikely. Especially since the resources to send a colony to live on Mars is already in place bar about 5 billion US dollars, making us invulnerable to total Earthly catastrophe. Even if an asteroid hit, a few of us will survive, whether it is by keeping a fire alight in the darkness and eating dead animals, or in a nuclear bunker for 6 months. In short the answer is not to fear, but work as quickly as possible towards creating the pinnacle of evolution and finding new homes.
