      I think this is Jason's attempt at getting me to keep one of these online journals. I don't know about this, it seems like a little too much work for me - and should I let my guard down I might just emit some emotion or something - - ugh!

      So I figure that I'll post a little about my day.  It was fairly annoying, as I had two finals and they were back to back.  They could have gone better, but I really don't care as I'm graduating.  Thank God.  Now I need a vacation, so I'm going to go home tomorrow until Friday (I plan on being back in Rochester around 11am).  After that hell, I went to the Honda dealership to see if they could tell me where the rattling noise was coming from my car.  The guy said it was the heat shield, which is apparently this useless part of sorts on the exhaust system.  He said that it would cost about $38 to get it cut off, but he didn't know if he could fit me in this afternoon.  I said it was ok; I only wanted to make sure it was ok to continue driving the car.  I'll change the oil in the car when I go home, so maybe I'll see where this heat shield thing is located and cut if off.  I have no idea what I am doing after graduation, and thanks to Bryan (you asshole), I'm thinking about it now.  I did call about the job on campus, but they said they won't be setting up interviews until the second week of May.  This is extremely annoying, as I need to know about a job.  There is absolutely nothing out there.  Nothing.  And if there is, it doesn't pay.  Ugh, I hope I get to sleep tonight and not allow this to bother me.  Alas, it is bedtime.

      Here is an article from Salon.com that I found interesting.  I'm posting it here rather than a link to it because you have to be a premium member to get it, and I have a daily pass so I figured I'd save everyone (all two people that read this) the trouble.  All I have to say is, didn't Bush comment on that Affirmative Action case that was pending in the Supreme Court?:   GOP defends Ayatollah Santorum   If the president truly believes the Pennsylvania zealot is "an inclusive man," we're all in trouble.  By Joan Walsh, from Salon.com  April 26, 2003 It took a few days, but finally President Bush came to the defense of Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who's been hammered by Democrats and a few brave Republicans for equating homosexuality with bigamy, polygamy, incest and adultery in an Associated Press interview.   Since the story broke Monday, there's been official silence from the White House, but on Friday Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer told reporters, "The president believes that the senator is an inclusive man. ... The president has confidence in Sen. Santorum and thinks he's doing a good job as senator -- including in his leadership post."   Well, now we know. Calling Santorum an "inclusive man" is about as truthful as calling Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon a "man of peace" -- even Sharon's admirers know he's a warrior. But being president makes you very powerful, and means you're almost never called a liar, even when you're lying.   There is nothing inclusive about Rick Santorum, who, as chairman of the Republican Conference, is the GOP's No. 3 Senate leader. He is a right-wing extremist who has more in common with fanatical Islamic fundamentalists than with many Americans. The president's failure to repudiate him or his remarks is appalling -- and in the long run, it will cost him politically.   I agree with Andrew Sullivan, a stalwart Bush defender who nonetheless wrote on Friday, with evident pain: "The White House still doesn't understand the damage that this incident is doing, the fact that it is beginning to make it simply impossible for gay people and their families -- or any tolerant person -- to vote for the president's party."   The full text of Santorum's remarks should give all Americans the creeps -- and not only when he grossed out the AP reporter by talking about "man on dog" sex. "I'm sorry, I didn't think I was going to talk about 'man on dog' with a United States senator, it's sort of freaking me out," she told him. I bet. (Sometimes I wonder about the inner life of these anti-sex fanatics. Why do I suspect Santorum's spent more time thinking about "man on dog" sex than the rest of us?) Let's be clear: Santorum wasn't just talking about gays; he was expressly denying that Americans have a right to privacy. Talking about a Texas sodomy law currently before the Supreme Court, he went on at great length:   "The right to privacy is a right that was created in a law that set forth a [ban on] rights to limit individual passions. And I don't agree with that ... Does that undermine the fabric of our society? I would argue yes, it does. It all comes from, I would argue, this right to privacy that doesn't exist in my opinion in the United States Constitution, this right that was created, it was created in Griswold -- Griswold was the contraceptive case -- and abortion. And now we're just extending it out. And the further you extend it out, the more you -- this freedom actually intervenes and affects the family. You say, well, it's my individual freedom. Yes, but it destroys the basic unit of our society because it condones behavior that's antithetical to strong, healthy families. Whether it's polygamy, whether it's adultery, where it's sodomy, all of those things, are antithetical to a healthy, stable, traditional family."   Sullivan has correctly asked whether that means Santorum wants to criminalize adultery. It's a good question. And contraception too?   The Pennsylvania ayatollah has refused to retract his remarks. He insists he's not against homosexuals, only "homosexual acts." But despite Santorum's radical statements, Republicans have proudly told reporters there will be no rerun of the Trent Lott debacle, in which the Senate majority leader was sacked for publicly admiring Strom Thurmond's racist presidential campaign last December. Why? For one thing, Lott got thrown overboard less because his GOP colleagues cared about his racism than because they thought he was a liability who wasn't loyal enough to Bush, had made a lot of enemies and cut too many deals with Democrats. Santorum's a company man, so everybody got the talking points: Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, like Fleischer, calls him "a man of inclusion." Actually, most Republicans got the no-talking points: The White House and Republican National Committee have advised Republicans not to comment on Santorum's outrageous remarks when asked about them by the media, so most of them aren't.   But they should be asked about them anyway, again and again. The other reason Santorum won't get the Lott treatment is that Republicans think homophobia, unlike racism, won't cost them politically, and that it's still safe to bash gays. Reporters should question Santorum and his defenders at every opportunity. Do they think Vice President Dick Cheney's gay daughter Mary should be prosecuted for her "homosexual acts?" And does the GOP believe in a right to privacy? Should adultery be criminalized? What about contraception?   Reporters tried, but failed, to get Ari Fleischer to expand on his vapid statements defending Santorum on Friday. Get a load of this exchange:    Reporter:  What's the president's beliefs about homosexuality?   Fleischer:  You know, that's a question that's been put to the president, and if you go back and you look at it, the president has said that, first of all, he doesn't ask that question about people. He judges people about who they are, their individual soul. That's not a matter the president concerns himself with. He judges people for how they act and how they relate, and that's his focus on that.   Reporter:  How they act sexually? Because I asked sexually ...    Fleischer:  How they act as a person. The same way ...    Reporter:  But the police in Texas asked how they act sexually.    Fleischer:  The same way you would say that about how anybody -- what's his reaction to this person or that person -- say, are they a nice person, what kind of person are they? It has nothing to do with their sexuality.   Reporter:  So does he believe that they ought to be free to be themselves, without interference from police?    Fleischer:  The president has always said that when it comes to legal matters, that it's a question of different groups, homosexual groups, gay groups should not have special rights or special privileges.    Reporter:  Is it a special privilege to be able to love the person you love the way you want to love them, without interference from the police?   Fleischer:  If you're asking about a matter that is a legal matter that is pending before the Supreme Court, that's a matter for the court to rule on, and we'll find out what the court says in the specific case in mind.   Reporter:  So he has no position on that?   Fleischer:  It's a matter that's pending before the court, in regard to your last question.   It's worth remembering who was Texas governor in 1998, when police burst into the bedroom of the gay couple whose case is before the Supreme Court: Yes, it was Fleischer's boss, our president. He's had plenty of time to rethink that law, which was enforced on his watch, and he hasn't. He had all week to rethink Santorum's outrageous remarks, and repudiate them, and he didn't.   After watching a segment about Santorum on Fox News the other night, I stayed tuned as the network segued into an Iraq update, and a Fox commentator decried the country's Shiites for trying to "introduce religion into political life." Of course the president's party is trying to do the same. Let's hope Santorum's candor wakes more Americans up to the fact that Iraqis aren't the only ones at risk of losing their freedom to religious fundamentalism.

      So I have switched to the Blogger.com service.  The Scribble.nu service was extremely unreliable, and this is proving to be much more effective.  If you care to read the old journal, which was pretty entertaining at times, you can click on the old journal link, and it should take you to the Scribble journal, if their website is working.  Stupid thing.  Nothing much else going on.  I have two tests tomorrow, and I should probably study for them.  Oh well, I really don't care anymore.

      Getting ready for my 3pm phone interview.  Getting ready for my 3pm phone interview.  Getting ready for my 3pm phone interview.  Getting ready for my 3pm phone interview.  Getting ready for my 3pm phone interview.  Bored.  I think I'm going to the mall with Bryan after this interview.  Not sure that I will get anything, but it will be nice to look.  I think Kevin is coming tomorrow, not sure tough.  I'm a little confused there and can't remember what the actual decision was on that.  Ok, time to print out the application I sent them so I have my qualifications in front of me.  Woohoo.  Maybe I'll give UR a call too so that I know where they are in their search (God only knows).  Results of the phone interview after 3...stay tuned.  ;-)

      Well, whatever, I'll just do nothing tonight, again.  Oh the joys of not having to go to school and not being employed.  At least my next paycheck will be for 64 hours.  Thank God!  I'll need the money to last me through June, plus I want to take an overnight trip to Toronto or something.  Then again, that will be on hold because of the terror alert being on High.  I'm so sick of this terror alert system.  At leat tell me what I am on Code Orange for, then I might feel better.  I also want to go visit John in B-rock, but I'll wait until I see if I have to visit Potsdam for the job, because its close by there.  I spent the afternoon mailing out a couple more applications, and then rebuilding my music collection.  I think I have a very good foundation, thanks to Soules and the CDs that I have burned.  And this Ministry of Sound radio streaming in Windows Media Player is fantastic.  Things I'd like to purchase: New shoes, a shirt or two, sunglasses.  I am not sure what I am going to do tonight; go figure.  At least I can stop doing the dishes in the sink.  I may go enjoy some time on the rooftop patio, then certainly watch the American Idol finale (although I have no opinion on who wins).

      Well graduation went well.  Surprisingly enough.  What else has been going on, you ask?  I have a phone interview with Potsdam on Thursday.  I'm not 100% sure about the job, but I figure that it couldn't hurt to interview and that it would be good practice.  I wish Rochester would get back to me soon.  I have been downloading my MP3 collection again because it obviously went away in the format of my computer.  The computer is running better too, especially with a new fan and stuff.  Katie and Katherine are coming over and we're walking down to Chester Cab pizza.  I ate already, but I'll go along for the walk, and will probably get something from Abbott's.  Maybe not.  Anyway, I should get going.

      An article!  This one will make all those Class of 2003 graduates feel good.  Enjoy.  May 14, 2003  Graduates Lower Sights in Stagnant Job Market  By DAVID LEONHARDT, NYTimes.com   CHAPEL HILL, N.C., May 12 - In years past, most seniors at the University of North Carolina ignored the recruiters from Newell Rubbermaid, the maker of dishwashing gloves and Calphalon cookware, dismissing the company as another unfashionable manufacturer. This year, the handful of students Newell hired as management trainees became minor campus celebrities, simply because they had secured jobs months before graduation.  When North Carolina seniors receive their diplomas here on Sunday, only about 15 percent of them will have jobs awaiting them, half the percentage that did a few springs ago, according to a university estimate. Another 25 percent will enroll in graduate school, leaving about 6 in 10 seniors without a long-term plan come Monday morning.  The nation's class of 2003 was the last one to enter college while the stock market was still rising, but it is graduating into the worst hiring slump in 20 years, one that is now into its second year on campuses and has afflicted young and well-educated workers to an unusual degree.   Corporations, after cutting their hiring of new graduates by 36 percent between 2001 and 2002, are hiring about the same number of graduates as they did last year, according to a survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers.  "We definitely picked the wrong time to be graduating from college," said Morgan Bushey, 21, who will make about $200 a week teaching English in France, after having been rejected by seven law schools. "We just have to hold on with our fingertips for a few years until we can do what we really want to do."  The lack of jobs is the main reason that applications to medical school increased this year for the first time in seven years, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Applications to law schools jumped 10 percent, after having risen almost 18 percent last year. The number of people taking the Graduate Record Exam, the standardized test required for most doctoral and master's programs, rose to its highest level ever, after declining through much of the late 1990's.   Meanwhile, applications to Teach for America, which recruits college graduates to teach for two years in public schools in poor neighborhoods, have more than tripled in the last two years; Wendy Kopp, the program's founder, said the economy appeared to be one reason. Americorps, the national service program that pays $9,300 a year, and the Peace Corps have also become more popular and more selective.  College seniors have reacted to their poor timing with a mixture of anxiety and level-headedness. Many recall the signing bonuses and stock options offered to graduates a few years ahead of them and wonder how their own careers will get started.  "There is a haunting sense of insecurity," said Michael Barlow, a senior here who hopes eventually to work in the Foreign Service and is still looking for a job. "It is terrifying to be out of school with no job lined up and ready to go."  But few of them express the frustration that is common among older unemployed workers who know that their long-term prospects have dimmed and who have dropped out of the labor force in large numbers during the last two years.   Asha Rangaraj, a North Carolina senior from Monroe, La., recalls that her brother, two years older than she is, was hired out of college to work for Bill Gates's money manager "really without any experience." She, on the other hand, endured a few unpromising interviews before deciding to enroll in North Carolina's master's program in accounting - in large part because 99 percent of its graduates get jobs, she said.   Still, Ms. Rangaraj said: "I think it's definitely temporary. Everybody has that feeling - two or three years, and everything will be back to normal."  The change has been particularly unpleasant in Chapel Hill, home to one of the country's most selective public universities, whose lush campus sits just a few miles from Research Triangle Park, the once-booming technology cluster.   But seniors on every campus - big and small, Ivy League and community college - are struggling to find entry-level jobs that they want, college officials say.  "It's pretty grim," said Jack R. Rayman, the director of career services at Pennsylvania State University. Its graduate-school fair drew thousands of students this year, filling large ballrooms in the student union.   Over all, the unemployment rate for people ages 20 through 24 rose to 10.1 percent last month, up from 9.9 percent a year earlier and less than 7 percent in 2000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The jobless rate for the entire work force was 6 percent last month.  Courtney Flaks, 21, a senior at the University of North Carolina from North Brunswick, N.J., said her plan was "just to go home and annoy people for jobs. I don't have any idea how long it's going to take."  Ms. Flaks, who is seeking a job as a graphic designer at a magazine, had a summer internship at Seventeen magazine and recently won a competition to redesign the nameplate of a campus literary magazine. Even so, she has had little success just finding openings to apply for.   "I finally have an interview, kind of," Ms. Flaks said, of an upcoming visit to Conde Nast, the publishing company in New York. "It's an exploratory interview. I don't know what that means."   Many of this year's success stories have come at companies like Newell that were the antithesis of excitement during the dot-com craze of the late 1990's. This year, however, excitement requires little more than an offer of a good-paying job.  According to Marcia B. Harris, the director of career services here, North Carolina's biggest recruiters -  and thus hottest companies - include Newell; Enterprise Rent-a-Car; Ferguson Enterprises, a distributor of plumbing supplies, and Modern Woodmen of America, an insurer.  Newell has a management trainee program that is hiring 400 college graduates this year across the country.  By contrast, Accenture and Ernst & Young, consulting firms that specialize in technology and that each hired 25 seniors at the peak of the boom, hired a combined total of three or four this year, Ms. Harris said.  Jon Narveson, another senior, from Asheville, N.C., came to Chapel Hill expecting that he would end up at a computer company, he said. He will instead move to Charlotte this summer and oversee Newell products at some Lowe's home-improvement stores in the area.  "Whether it's fashionable or unfashionable doesn't matter to me," Mr. Narveson said. What matters, he said, is that he likes the Newell executives he met and that they seem eager to help him learn the business.  The students who have been accepted by Teach for America or the Peace Corps, in spite of this year's odds, express similar gratitude.  After watching many of last year's seniors return home after graduation without jobs, Stephanie L. Scott adopted an attitude of "whatever it takes," she said. As a backup, she and a friend met in a library for two hours, three times a week over the course of two months, to study for the G.R.E. But her first priority was Teach for America, and she will begin teaching in Louisiana this summer.  "Right now, it almost doesn't matter what you're doing," said Ms. Scott, who is from Goldsboro, N.C., and was the first person in her family to attend college. "If you have a job, people look at you like, `You're so lucky.' "  In fact, many seniors said that the last few months had given them a sense of rejection on a scale they had never before felt. Ms. Bushey said she could not help but compare applying to college, when she was accepted at North Carolina before Thanksgiving, to the string of law-school rejections she received, including some from places she had thought of as safety schools.  Some juniors here said they were already preparing themselves for similar experiences next year.  "When we were going into school, there was a lot of energy and enthusiasm to go get your four years of education and then get a job," said Matt Tepper, North Carolina's student body president, who will remain on campus for both sessions of summer school after struggling to find a paid internship. "Now it seems like everybody is going to law school."

      So my computer has decided to start making a strange noise that is extremely hard to describe.  Anyway, I took it to the Gateway store for their tech people to look at it, as I think the fan might be going.  Therefore, I won't have a computer for the next day or so, and maybe more if they have to replace a part.  If you need me, you can reach me via phone or e-mail, but I won't be checking the e-mail as often as before.  Now I'm off to take my very last exam.  So far this semester I've got 2 B's and a D+ (don't ask or comment on that one).  This one should be easy, being Intro to Computers and all.  Yay!  Then I'm done, FOREVER (or at least for a reasonable amount of time before I go to graduate school for something).

      I found this interesting, and as I am supporting Howard Dean (as of now) in the Democratic primaries, I'll give it a post.   Why Dean is still the Democrat to watch  By Howard Fineman, Special to MSNBC.com  Even if you follow politics closely, you probably didn't notice that the Howard Dean boomlet faded a few weeks ago. The theory was that no anti-war candidate -- and Dean is one -- can survive the fall of Baghdad and the rise of a president playing Top Gun on an aircraft carrier. Well, Democratic insiders (and their media cousins) may think that Dean's a non-starter in the race for their party's 2004 presidential nomination. I don't agree. In fact, the former governor of Vermont is still a man to watch, if not the man to beat.  WHY? A FEW reasons. For one, Dean has made himself the organizing principal -- pun intended -- of these earliest innings of the campaign. As they say in baseball, he's the straw that stirs the drink. He has the august Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts reacting to his moves (and elevating Dean by attacking him). Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri unveiled a sweeping healthcare proposal, playing to an issue that Dean, a doctor, hoped to own.  And Dean's dovish views and chesty demeanor are defining the debate, drawing reactions from other contenders. His biggest applause line is: "I represent the democratic wing of the Democratic Party!" Sen. Bob Graham of Florida had a retort last week in South Carolina: "I represent the electable wing of the Democratic Party!" In a TV debate there, Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut added his own reaction, which was that no candidate who wasn't "strong on defense" could defeat George W. Bush. Translation: That means you, Howard.   Another reason Dean still bears watching is his organizational savvy. Being an outsider, yet one with sterling connections and technical skill, is a good combination. He is running a relatively lean but efficient operation, with knowledgeable veterans (Steve McMahon and Joe Trippi from D.C.) teaming up with Ben & Jerry types from Vermont and elsewhere.   So far, Dean's outfit is the most adept at using the Internet, which is to the 2004 campaign what cable TV was to 1992 and direct-mail to 1980 -- the new Best Practice for reaching and motivating voters.   This week, the Dean campaign's grass-roots enthusiasts will put themselves on display, gathering in about 250 "Meetups" generated through the Web site of the same name. These events turn traditional organizing on its head: The campaign people go to the meeting, they don't put it together.   KERRY'S ARK  A tiny but revealing indicator of organizational skill: the speed with which the allegedly inexperienced Dean campaign responded to attacks during the TV debate in South Carolina. They matched the top-shelf and perhaps top-heavy Kerry campaign stride for stride in rushing printed rebuttals into the press room during the event. "Kerry has a Noah's Ark campaign," a top Dean lieutenant told me in South Carolina. "They've got two of everything."   Then there's the candidate himself. Howard Dean, at least as a candidate, is a shark in Land's End clothing. He is always moving forward and always on the attack. Most of his rivals genuinely loathe him at this point, but Dean doesn't seem to care. He's looking to inspire voters, and thinks his combative style is what they want. He thinks that Democrats want some anger in their candidate to confront Bush's Red State triumphalism. Dean appears to draw inspiration from the cutthroat side of the Kennedy legacy, Bobby and Jack in particular. Their rhetoric soared and their ideals were noble, but their tactics were tough. When they wanted to dismiss someone as a nonentity, they called him a "nice man."   Dean is not a nice man. His Web page, for example, derides Kerry as "The Anointed One." In the latest polls, he and Kerry are running neck and neck in New Hampshire, where only one of them will survive the primary next year.   THE WAR QUESTION  Finally, there's the question of the war. The swift military victory in Iraq, so the argument goes, made Dean look bad, or at least irrelevant. The American people generally back President Bush's strategy, which is to drain terrorism-producing swamps by forcing changes in the corrupt and brutal regimes that control them. Even so, Dean continues to insist that Saddam Hussein was not a threat to America, and that attacking his regime wasn't necessarily in our interest.   For now, it seems like a losing argument for Dean to make. But, in politics, a week is a year and a year is a lifetime. No one knows what Iraq will look like a year from now. No one knows where the war on terrorism is headed. And at the grassroots of the Democratic Party, there remains deep, Dean-like skepticism about the war in Iraq and military answers in general.   Remember: To win the Democratic nomination, you need only Democratic votes -- and plugged-in Democrats at that. In that small universe, you don't have to play the role of Top Gun to win.   (Howard Fineman is Newsweek's chief political correspondent and an NBC News analyst. )

      I have just completed the last paper of my undergraduate career - very exciting!!! To celebrate Jason and I had a YEA! beer at 1:25am....cheers to the good like, eh. In 5 hours I will be heading to work for another thrilling day of arranging various campus services for my own commencement ceremony (not that I'm complaining). I guess that's the update for now...as classes are almost done I'll have more time to search for scandal :-)

      Ok, I have another link to share (I'm just in a sharing mood today, aren't I?).  I remember this from a long time ago, but I recently came across it again.  It is a  urlLink political compass  that tells you where you fall on the left-right economic scale and authoritarian-libertarian scale.  Quite interesting.  I am a  urlLink Economic Left/Right: -2.38, Authoritarian/Libertarian: -5.33  (Libertarian Left).  Everyone should try it out and see what it says.  Enjoy!

      Anna Anna galmorous Anna, Anna Nicole! Anna Anna fabulous Anna, Anna Nicole!  *dances*  I'm not sure from where my strange fascination with the show comes.  It is just so damn funny.  Hmmm, I went to work today and sent out my applications for less desirable jobs at Potsdam, Colgate, and Vermont.  Rochester would still be my first pick, seeing as how I already know the school and associated facts, but (almost) any job would do at this point.  Woohoo.  Aww, Bryan has to write a paper tonight....ok, I suppose I won't bother him.  Did I mention that I only have the CSC108 final left?  Yay!  Oh, got two of my grades...I have a B in Voting Rights and a B in Politics and the Mass Media.  Yay!  (the other grades are going to be not-so-good, so we'll rejoice in the goodness of these B's).

      I'm at work and trying to waste a couple of minutes before moving onto my next project...hark!...the voicemail light just lit up...who could it be? *listens to message* It was Malcolm Bugler (thick English accent, Mindy :-)...he's looking for meeting space...dammit, back to work :-(  Tonight I get to write my Language and Culture paper - boring - then my Senior Seminar project - double boring - then wait for the CSC108 final - ugh - someone shoot me, por favor.

      Yet another uneventful day.  I'm waiting for my last final on Friday, so I have nothing to do between now and then.  I think I'll just work up a storm and make some extra money.  Last night was Melissia's housewarming party.  It was fun; good eats and good drinks.  Yummy!  Nice house too, plus nice people.  What more could you ask for?  I e-mailed some people to see if they wanted to walk down to Abbott's to get some custard (I have a strange craving), so hopefully they'll be able to go.  I'll try to write some more later, especially if anything more exciting than the current nothing happens.

      Ok, I've never posted to any of the online journal thingys, because I don't trust them. But I'll do it for you Jason :)  I think it is clear what we need to do judging from this article: somehow make lots of money (legitimately, don't get any sneaky ideas) and then go into politics. If a REAGAN is unhappy with the situation in America, then we can get anyone over to our side ;)  In the meantime I will jet off tomorrow to finish my currently unusable masters degree to go with my unusable undergraduate degree (thank you Mr. Bush for concentrating so much on the economy).  That's all from here for now.

      I found another article on Salon.com that I found interesting.  The fact that the Reagans are irritated at the Bush administration for tossing around Reagan's name and legacy makes me giggle.  I might feel differently if Bush had actually created some jobs in the past two years, but he's gone no where on that.  What will I do?  Anyway, article is below:   Reagan blasts Bush  By David Talbot, from Salon.com  April 14, 2003 The Bush inner circle would like to think of George W.'s presidency as more of an extension of Ronald Reagan's than of his one-term father's. Reagan himself, who has long suffered from Alzheimer's disease, is unable to comment on those who lay claim to his political legacy. But his son, Ron Jr., is -- and he's not pleased with the association.   "The Bush people have no right to speak for my father, particularly because of the position he's in now," he said during a recent interview with Salon. "Yes, some of the current policies are an extension of the '80s. But the overall thrust of this administration is not my father's -- these people are overly reaching, overly aggressive, overly secretive, and just plain corrupt. I don't trust these people."   Reagan spoke with Salon from his home in Seattle, where he lives with his wife, Doria, a psychologist. A former ballet dancer ("At 45, I'm afraid those days are over"), he has worked in recent years as a magazine journalist and a TV personality, currently hosting dog shows for the Animal Planet network ("I live 'Best in Show'"). He and Doria have three cats, but no children ("They're like kids, without the tuition"). Though he never followed his father into politics, Reagan takes a strong interest in public issues, serving on the board of the Creative Coalition, an organization founded in 1989 by performers like Susan Sarandon and Christopher Reeve to politically mobilize entertainers and artists. Reagan recently moderated a Creative Coalition panel discussion in San Francisco on the topic of free expression during wartime, featuring Alec Baldwin on the left and Michael Medved on the right (and a smoldering Sean Penn in the audience).   Reagan, still as lean as he was in his dancing days, has a sharp tongue -- but like his father, he has a knack for softening his barbs with a charming affability and disarming sense of humor.   Reagan took a swipe at Bush during the 2000 GOP convention in Philadelphia, which featured a tribute to his father, telling the Washington Post's Lloyd Grove, "The big elephant sitting in the corner is that George W. Bush is simply unqualified for the job... What's his accomplishment? That he's no longer an obnoxious drunk?" Since then he's been quiet about the current occupant of the White House -- until now.   Some observers have compared Bush's persona as an intellectually challenged but politically gifted leader to that of Reagan. But the younger Reagan vehemently rejects the analogy. "The gunslinging cowboy, the actor who just read his lines -- that stereotype doesn't fit who my father really was.   "My father had decades of experience in public life. He was president of his union, he campaigned for presidential candidates, he served two terms as governor of California -- and that was not a ceremonial office as it is in Texas. And he had already run for president, against Ford in '76, nearly unseating the sitting president in his own party. He knew where he was coming from, he had spent years thinking and speaking about his views. He didn't have to ask Dick Cheney what he thought.   "Sure, he wasn't a technocrat like Clinton. But my father was a man -- that's the difference between him and Bush. To paraphrase Jack Palance, my father crapped bigger ones than George Bush."   Reagan says he doesn't have anything personal against Bush. He met him only once, at a White House event during the Reagan presidency. "At least my wife insists we did -- he left absolutely no impression on me. But Doria remembers him very negatively -- I can't repeat what she said about him, I'd rather not use profanity. I do remember Jeb -- a big fella, seemed to be the brightest of the bunch. And of course their parents were very charming."   But Reagan has strong feelings about Bush's policies, including the war in Iraq, which he ardently opposes. "Nine-11 gave the Bush people carte blanche to carry out their extreme agenda -- and they didn't hesitate for a moment to use it. I mean, by 9/12 Rumsfeld was saying, 'Let's hit Iraq.' They've used the war on terror to justify everything from tax cuts to Alaska oil drilling."   Of course, Reagan's father was also known for his military buildup and aggressive foreign policy. "Yes," he concedes, "there are some holdovers from my dad's years, like Elliott Abrams and, my God, Admiral Poindexter, who's now keeping watch over us all. But that observation doesn't hold up. My father gave a speech a couple years after he left the White House calling for 'an international army of conscience' to deal with failed states where atrocities are taking place. He had no thought that America should be the world's policeman. I know that for a fact from conversations I had with him. He believed there must be an international force to intervene where great human tragedy was occurring. Rwanda would have been a prime example, where a strike force capable of acting quickly could have gone in to stop the slaughter.   "Now George and Dick and Rummy and Wolfy all have a very different idea about America's role in the world. It was laid out by [Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul] Wolfowitz back in '92 -- Iraq is the center of the Middle East, its axis, and it's of such geo-strategic importance that we can't leave it in the hands of Saddam. We need to forcibly change that regime and use Iraq as a forward base for American democracy, setting up a domino effect in the region, and so on. My father, on the other hand, was well aware of the messiness of the Middle East, particularly after [the 1983 bombing of the Marine barracks in] Lebanon."   Reagan says his opinions about the war were not changed by the rapid fall of Baghdad. "Look, whether or not Saddam was a bad guy, or whether the Iraqi people were terribly oppressed, was never the issue. I mean I'm happy for the Iraqis, but that's not what this was all about. Nor was the military conclusion ever in doubt; this was the Dallas Cowboys playing a high school team. Their army was a third the size it was in '91, and it didn't give us much trouble then.   "And the weapons of mass destruction? Whatever happened to them? I'm sure we'll find some," he laughs. "They're being flown in right now in a C-130.   "There were, and will be, a lot of people killed over there. And if you don't care about the Iraqi casualties, what about the American? We stand to lose more people in the next months of occupation than we lost in the weeks of war. One of the reasons we escaped largely unscathed so far was because our military moved so fast. But now we're sitting targets -- we have to establish bases, patrol the streets, guard checkpoints. We're sitting targets for suicide bombers and other terrorists."   Reagan's parents were notoriously remote from their four children. Ron Jr. reportedly had the closest relations with his parents and he remains close with his mother, Nancy Reagan, who as the keeper of the Reagan flame is often called upon to dedicate public sites bearing her husband's name. Reagan says his mother shares his "distrust of some of these [Bush] people. She gets that they're trouble in all kinds of ways. She doesn't like their religious fervor, their aggression."   Reagan says his family feels particularly alienated from the Republican Party over its opposition to embryonic stem cell research, which could have significant benefit for Alzheimer patients like his father. "Now ignorance is one thing, ignorance can be cured. But many of the Republican leaders opposing this research know better, people like [Senate Majority Leader] Bill Frist, who's a doctor, for God's sake. People like him are blocking it to pander to the 20 percent of their base who are mouth-breathers. And that's unconscionable -- there are lives at stake here. Stem cell research can revolutionize medicine, more than anything since antibiotics."   Reagan, who says the label "progressive" would fit him, does not belong to a political party. "I'm certainly not a Republican; I couldn't belong to any party that had leaders like Tom DeLay. And the Democrats are too busy trying to out-Republican the Republicans."   His father entered politics at a relatively late stage in his life, after careers as a sports broadcaster, actor and General Electric pitchman. Has Reagan ever considered running for office? No, he insists, "I have no political ambitions. For one thing, I'm not interested in raising all that money. It's just not the life I want to lead. When is the last time you heard a politician speak his mind? McCain? Yes, he came close. But I once asked him at a Creative Coalition meeting, 'You talk passionately about this nexus of money and influence that is corrupting our democracy. Why don't you name names?' His response was a demurral.   "I have no problem with public service. And yes, better people should be running for office. But personally I just can't see myself doing it, to live in Washington D.C., the whole package. I was immersed in that my whole life. I saw politicians up close and there were so many who just repulsed me."   What if a group of concerned citizens approached him and helped raise money for his entry into politics -- would that make a difference? "You mean like they did with George W.? 'Hey, you've got name recognition, that's all that matters -- we'll give you millions of dollars to run!' Imagine coming to a man with just two years' experience in public office, and a ceremonial one at that. Imagine installing such a blank slate in the presidency of the United States! This is a regency, not a presidency.   "And they told us, 'Don't worry about W. not knowing anything, good old Dick Cheney will be his minder.' Dick Cheney? And this was going to be compassionate conservatism? Dick Cheney is to the right of Genghis Khan, he wants to drill in your backyard, he wants to deny black people their rights --it was all there in his voting record for us to see. What were we, rubes?"   While Reagan rejects a political career, he clearly doesn't shy from speaking out. What if GOP conservatives, who still lionize his father as the greatest president of the 20th century, pressure him to shut up? "That wouldn't be a smart thing for anyone to do."

      So camping was tons of fun.  I enjoyed the time away from it all with Kevin, Bryan, and Stephen.  Granted, I was a little on edge (ok, I was over the edge at times) since the job opening fell through, but overall it was a good time.  I hope everyone else had a good time too.  I'll work on getting some pictures online sometime in the near future.  My parents drove up today to see me, and they just left for home.  We had dinner and talked about what I am going to do.  Thankfully, they are helping with tremendously on the bill payments.  I feel stupid.  Stupid for not having a job.  Stupid for having horrible bills to pay.  Stupid for becoming overly emotional over it all.  I don't want to leave Rochester and the people I know here.  I love the people here, love them moreso than they may realize, and I shy away from starting anew in another city, or going home to Franklin and having to repress myself in a small town.  Don't get me wrong, I love going home for some rest and relaxation occassionally, but for me, going home to live after graduating from university is a dead end.  I don't want to be one of those people--the ones that go back to their hometown, never to leave it again...stuck there, unable to move on out of the rut of a poor economy.  Anyway, I am off to relax and try not to cry my brains out over this anymore.  It is difficult not to, but something will come along or I will find something...something has to work out, eventually.

      Well, I haven't updated in a while, so here goes...  On Tuesday, I cooked dinner for Kevin and I.  Despite the steak getting a little overdone on the one side, it was quite nice, especially just spending some time with Kevin.  We then went to throw a frisbee around for a bit, and ran into Anthony and his friend Melissa, who played with us.  I went out to lunch today with Melissia, which was nice.  The crazy dog was with us too...it was...hyper, but oh so soft.  It has been really stinkin' hot and humid here, but with the air conditioner, I'm getting by just fine.  The rest of the day was filled with nothing interesting, other than talking to Navin, who is still in Manila and won't be to NYC until mid-July.  Woohoo!  The job search is just waiting to hear back from the Alumni Association (Office of College Advancement).  The administrative assistant said that they would have a decision by the end of the week, so seeing as how this is Thursday, I should hear back anytime.  I really hope to get the job, not only because I need one, but because I think I can do a good job in the position.  This weekend, Bryan, Stephen, Kevin, and myself are going camping to Stony Brook.  It should be a good time...Bryan and I went to get a lot of stuff for it last night, and I'll call Kevin tonight to see what else needs to be done.

      From the book I am current reading,  The Picture of Dorian Gray , by Oscar Wilde.  I like this passage, and, obviously, have added the emphasis:  "He is all my art to me now," said the painter gravely.  "I sometimes think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the world's history.  The first is the appearance of a new medium for art, and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also.  What the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of Antinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will some day be to me.  It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from him, sketch from him.  Of course, I have done all that.  But he is much more to me than a model or a sitter.  I won't tell you that I am dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such that art cannot express it.  There is nothing that art cannot express, and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good work, is the best work of my life.   But in some curious way--I wonder will you understand me?--his personality has suggested to me an entirely new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style.  I see things differently, I think of them differently. I can now recreate life in a way that was hidden from me before.   'A dream of form in days of thought'--who is it who says that?  I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray has been to me.  The merely visible presence of this lad--for he seems to me little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty--his merely visible presence--ah! I wonder can you realize all that that means?  Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the perfection of the spirit that is Greek.  The harmony of soul and body -- how much that is!  We in our madness have separated the two, and have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is void.  Harry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me!  You remember that landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price but which I would not part with?  It is one of the best things I have ever done.  And why is it so?  Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray sat beside me.  Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the first time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had always looked for and always missed."  "Basil, this is extraordinary!  I must see Dorian Gray."   Hallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden.  After some time he came back.  "Harry," he said, "Dorian Gray is to me simply a motive in art.   You might see nothing in him.  I see everything in him.  He is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there.  He is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner.  I find him in the curves of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain colours.   That is all."

      Well, it is still raining here in Rochester.  Strange.  Anyway, I had my interview on Wednesday with the Alumni Association (a.k.a. Office of College Advancement).  It went really well, and they want me to come back to meet the rest of the Reunion staff.  I can't wait!  Could I possibly have a job?  I hope so!  I called my landlord and asked for two extra weeks until I have to tell them if I want the apartment next year.  This will give me time to know if I have a job or not, because I would like the apartment for one more year.  Tonight there is another party at Kevin's apartment, this time it is for Anthony's "graduation" (or, the end of his two weeks of summer class.  the last party was for his midterms).  Should be fun, like the last one.  :-)  I thought I had more to type today, but apparently not.

      Hmm.  What a lovely weekend, despite the rain here in Rochester.  It has been quite the rainy summer so far, but that's ok.  Rain is better than snow, that's all I have to say.  The party/gathering at Kevin's place was fun...we won a game of beer pong (soooooooo my college years.  lol), and then today we went to the Memorial Art Gallery.  'Twas loverly.  :-)  In a bit, my po' ass self (I have $.50 to my name) is going with Stephen, Bryan, and Katie to  The King and I  restaurant.  They are going to see the new Matrix movie afterwards, but I think I'll pass on it.  Bumming money for dinner off Bryan is enough, plus I've seen the movie already.  I'll just come home and relax I suppose.  Tomorrow, I have this strange urge to go to church.  Not sure why though, its quite odd.  I may go, if my butt is out of bed by 9:30a tomorrow.  If not, I'll just relax and watch some of the 10GB worth of  Family Guy  episodes I have downloaded.  Or play Sim City 4.  Ohhh, the life of the job-seeker.  Let's all pray the interview on Wednesday goes well and I get that job.

      Nothing much going on, just sitting around enjoying (err...not really) the free time.  Tonight I am supposed to go get coffee with Kevin, and he should call anytime now.  Then tomorrow is a little gathering at his place, and I'll see if he wants to do something this weekend.  Also tonight is the MTV Movie Awards, which I'll probably go watch with Bryan, should I be back in time from coffee.  It will be six months this Tuesday.  :-)  I'm not sure if it feels that long or not...part of me says "Yea, that's about right" and the other part says "Already?".  I hope it continues for many more, as its probably the happiest I have been in a long long while.  I have $20 to last until I get work.  This could be interesting, as part of that has to go to gas already (I'll have to wait for Saturday and get gas during the 5 cents off sale.  hehe).  Ok, nothing else going on.

      I was reading my journal and thought no one had posted in a while, but apparently Bryan did but didn't publish.  So today everyone gets two new entries!  Whoa!  I haven't posted in a while because my life has been pretty dull, and I didn't have much to write.  Anyway, I just got back on Sunday from Pittsburgh, where I was attending my cousin's wedding.  It was all very nice.  I called Jeff while I was there, but I didn't get time to see him.  The job stuff isn't going very far.  My phone interview with Potsdam was not-so-hot, so I don't expect to move on in that process.  Phone interviews just suck in general, but I figure its good practice at least.  Yesterday, I got a message from UR's Office of College Advacement (Alumni Association), and now I have an interview with them next Wednesday.  I hope that one goes well, as having a job would be nice.  The Admissions job went no where, which I don't understand, but don't really care anymore.  When I was home, my father told me that he thought I had made enough money to claim unemployment.  Apparently I do, so that paperwork is coming to me in the mail.  At least that will sustain me a little until I get a job.  It is the least New York can do for me after paying all those taxes, and the least UR an do for me after jerking me around.  Bastards.  Stephen is back in Rochester and moving into his new apartment in the Roosevelt.  Ohhhh...ahhhhh, the Roosevelt.  So luxurious.  hehe...it is a nice apartment.  I really like the layout of it.  He called yesterday and I went over to help him move furniture and arrange the apartment.  I should be an interior decorator for a living, apparently.  Oh well, maybe in my next life.  Last night Kevin and I had dinner, which was quite lovely as I hadn't seen him in a while, and tonight I believe we're going to Buffalo Wild Wings with the summer gang from RIT.  Should be exciting, but then again, moving furniture with Stephen was exciting.  Yay, something to do!!  OK, that's a lot of writing, so I'll end now.

      So no one has posted in a long long while, so I might as well seeing as that I'm not doing much else. Today is June 1, and that's pretty scarry as I can remember January 1, which doesn't seem to have been that long ago. Two months from today and I will be done at Conference & Events and.....going the the JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE concert in Buffalo!!!  I never thought I'd say it, but I kind of miss going to classes. Not all classes, but those interesting ones that had good discussions about global culture, current events, things like that. I just started re-reading the  Lexus and the Olive Tree  (Freedman) to get my brain thinking again. The benefit of working in an academic environment like UR is that you can think about problems on a more theoritical level than in corporate America, the downfall is that most staff people don't care to think much beyond the task in front of them :-(  I guess that's all for now. I'm about to go have brunch with Francine and Noah and discuss the recent shake-up at FAH as well as gossip about various other sketchy things - then it's off to Bernadette's graduation party with Radhika, Cory, and crew. I want to go see the Matrix Reloaded but haven't yet, so maybe I'll do that too post-Berna.

      Mindy has been in town, and all is going well.  She leaves tonight at 10:30p on her train back to South Bend, Indiana.  Right now, I'm sitting here waiting for Bryan and Mindy to arrive for dinner.  Should be yummy and a good time, unfortunately I'm a little preoccupied with the job situation.  I am still waiting to hear back about the job...hopefully today or tomorrow, else I'll have to go back home, which I rather not do.  Ugh, and so the nervousness and depression sets in...

      Well, last night was a lot of fun.  I went to the Eve 6 concert at the Water Street Music Hall with Kevin.  Only $6, and 3 bands (Eve 6, AM Radio, and Stage).  It was sooooooo much fun!  A word of advice though: don't get so hyper that you jump the bushes in front of our apartment--my knee will take a bit to heal.  Anyway, Flogging Molly comes next Wednesday, so I think we may go to that.  Hey, its something to do, and its cheap.  Thanks again Kevin, it means so much to me.  Mindy is on here way now from Indiana.  She has a job at Indiana University, but it doesn't start until Aug 4, so she's coming to see us for a few days.  I can't wait to see her!  Tonight we're doing dinner with Stephen and Paul, because I may have to leave soon and Stephen leaves for a weekend home on Thursday.  Then on Friday, I'm going out with all my college friends for a night on the town.  I hope everyone can make it (9:30p, Old Toad and we'll move on from there).  Should be a fun night of partying and whatnot.  Note to self: don't be so hyper.  Ok, maybe more later when Mindy is here, as I'm sure there will be amazing stories then.

I just hope there will be some friends there to comfort me, to spend some time with, to come up with the ideas of things to do.  Yes, yes, it is quite possibly the dumbest thing to get upset over, but I do.

      Finally, a good day to write about!  I got a message about a job opening at the University, so I applied to it and then was contacted about an interview.  Yay!  Then I enjoyed lunch with Katie Moore at Mr. Chen's.  Good company, decent cheap food, and much fun.  Then I talked to Brian (as usual), John, and Jeff, all of which are exciting, as it is always good to keep in touch with them.  They are all doing well.  Hmmm, then I talked with Andrew from high school, who now lives in NYC.  I hadn't talked with him in a while, and I got his contact information because I might go some weekend to NYC to see Navin, so I might as well see Andrew too.  It'd be fun!  Then I went with Stephen and Paul to get some pizza slices.  While the pizza is kinda hurting my stomach, it was good company and fun listening to Stephen tell the neverending stories and then Paul shortening them (whew!) for us.  Then, to top off a great day, I went to Java's with Kevin.  It is always good to see and talk to him, and I'm happy he is doing well.  Hopefully things will continue to build on this great day and I'll finally be on some sort of stable track.  Anyway, thank you to everyone for making it such a good day, I really do enjoy my time and conversations with you all.  So tomorrow is the interview at 10am, then stopping into the SAO to see them, and maybe lunch with Stephen and Bryan, maybe Paul if he is there.  Then, this weekend I'll help Bryan move some stuff into his new apartment.  Next week I have Kevin penciled in for a dinner on Monday, as I need to use up some of the food in my freezer in case I have to move.  Next Friday, all my close friends (and people they know) are invited for a night out on the town starting at like 9:30pm.  We'll go to the Alexander St. area, and then maybe over to the new places at High Falls.  I'll e-mail everyone.  Woohoo!  I can't wait!  It is always nice to have things to do since I don't have a job and all, so I thank everyone again for helping me out during this time, you really are the greatest.  Alas, it is time for bed, maybe a little TV first, but definitely bed in a bit.  Goodnight, sweet dreams.

      Well, I hope everything is going to be ok.  Things were going so well before then I screwed them up, but hopefully we have had the last of my stupid mistakes and subsequent apologies/talks and can get back to the friendship path that was going so well.  Thank you so much for your help with this, I really hate to jeopardize my time and friendship with you.  Without friends no one would choose to live, though he had all other goods. - Aristotle   Be courteous to all, but intimate with few, and let those few be well tried before you give them your confidence.

      Everything is going to work out, that's what I keep telling myself.  Positive attitude here!  I hope to hear back from some of these jobs that I applied to, as it would be nice to at least get out there and interview at various places.  Mmmm, fish fry for dinner tonight...mmmmmm.

      I miss you.  You are funny, sweet, sexy, hard-working, smart, caring, and much much more; you are the best thing to happen to me in Rochester, and for it all to end so suddenly--to have to move away, and to do it without you--is painful.  It hurts so much.  The pain in my heart is unbearable.  I miss lying in your arms.  I miss being with you.  I'm so sorry and upset that things couldn't work out, because I could see myself with you for years to come.  I doubt you see the same in me.  But, you'll find someone who is right for you, or at least have experiences trying.  If you don't find someone, or if your new experiences bring you back my way, just know that I will still be here, hanging onto your every word said, your smiles, your laughs, our experiences.  I can't throw them out and into the past.  They are a permanent part of me that I don't want to go away.  You are a permantent part of me.  So I will be here, still clutching our experience, and ready to have more.  Despite all this pain and anguish, I would do it again, and I hope that you would too.

      So I think everything is going to work out fine, which is good because I don't know what I would do if you had to leave my life completely.  I'm happy that this happened on fairly good terms.  Thank you again for listening to me today, and for talking from the heart as well.  I look forward to hearing from you soon, and hanging out a bit before I leave.  Remember to always be honest with yourself and those around you, to know that you are a wonderful person who will certainly continue to brighten my life, and that of others.

      Things will get better; friendships will be strengthened, we will grow from the experiences together, and help each other through this difficult time and onto better times of stability as friends and mutual supporters.  I know this came at a bad time, and that we should have been more open about expectations and needs/goals in the past, but we can't change that now, and it is important to understand that we had to deal with this eventually--either a month ago, now, or a month ahead.  I enjoyed all my times with you, and couldn't ask for anything better.  The important thing to always remember is that I look forward to many more fun times with you; I will be here to support you in everything you do and that I will always love you and care for you.

      Well, the power going out just sucks.  I ended up going to Bryan's to hang out with him and Stephen.  We figured we'd enjoy the power being out together.  I can home around 11:30p and went to bed, realizing for the first time how much I rely on my ceiling fan for cooling.  The power apparently came on around 4am, which seemed to be in enough time to save the refrigerator contents.  Anyway, work was cancelled today, as the building didn't have power, but then it did.  Either way, we left.  LOL, didn't want to be there.  I got some errands done, opened up an account at Chase bank, etc.  Good day to just catch up on random tasks.  I think I'll spend the afternoon cleaning the apartment, and then resting a bit before Paul's housewarming party at 8p.  Should be a good time, get to see the guys and some of Paul's friends, and also Kevin might be coming over--but it depends how he feels due to the wisdom teeth removal that was Wednesday.  Ugh, I remember how much that sucked for me.  Anyway, always good to see everyone.

      Well, I think things are finally going to be ok.  Yes, I know I have said that numerous times before, but I really think they are this time.  Tomorrow I got to speak with a counselor and hopefully work some things out, get some emotions and poor feelings in order rather than jumping all around my brain.  It is just hard to to be attached to someone like that anymore.  Thankfully we are still talking, and I feel that I'm ready to put it behind me and not live in the emotions and questions of "what if..." and "if only...".  Plus, being apart for a bit will help too, just having some space to get accustomed to not having the person nearby.  Luckily, I've had a very patient person who listens to me and was willing to help when he could.  :-)  I like it when people ask me how I am doing, and what I have been up to, and show interest in me.  I makes me feel like there's a connection in the friendship and a general concern for one another's well-being...something that many people I talk to don't do.  Anyway,  hopefully  things are on the up and up.  If work just wasn't so damn boring at times, and if everyone's damn computer and phone worked like they should and I didn't have to hear the constant whining about it.  Anyway, its not that bad, I keep busy and do what projects need done here and there.  Ideally the office would be organized when I got there, rather than unorganized like the rest of my life...that way I wouldn't feel lost everywhere.  Actually, come to think of it, I think that has contributed a lot to my recent anxiety (if it really is that).  So, soon it will be time to date some people and see where things go...The only thing is that I don't want to hurt anyone, and then there is the whole "finding someone" thing.  Blah  Smiling!  Smiling!

      Second day of work went better, as I finally have my desk space and its all organized.  Woohoo!  Once the phones and computer system gets all organized, things will be even better.  Plus, we have a lot of fun, so it makes work go by faster.  Tonight I went to Bryan's to watch our usual Tuesday Bravo schedule.  Kevin, Katie, Matt, Stephen, Paul, Erica, and Bryan were there, so it was a full house.  Everyone is so much fun to hang out with, but I do have some favorites!  Everything is going great, I feel.  I'm comfortable about the friendship, and I hope he is too.  Sometimes I can't really get a feeling from him, but I certainly hope that he's not masking anything.  I wish I would know more about how he was feeling and that he was more open about that; I'll trust that if something was wrong that he'd say something.  All in all, I feel good about things.  Anyway, tomorrow is my first full day of work.  My AIM there is "jesmith81", so feel free to message anytime, and if I'm busy I'll just message back ASAP.  Goodnight, sweet dreams all!

      The first day of work went a-ok.  The orientation in the morning was pretty damn boring, but the afternoon was good because I was actually in the office and figuring our how things are going to work (because the office changed so much, procedures and stuff are also changing for everyone, so we're try to figure out the best way to do things).  Hmm, other than that, nothing is really happening.  Things seem to be going fine with the single thing.  Still trying to figure out how to move from one person to another, not that I'm at all interested in entering a relationship again in the near future, but moreso finalizing the feelings from the last.  It is just so hard when you love someone to the extent that I do; I just hope all goes well for both of us.  Tomorrow will bring another day of benefits orientation, then a half day of work.  Thankfully it is the last of my orientation half-days, so I'll be getting into the regular groove at work.

      Well this weekend has turned out OK afterall.  Yesterday Bryan and I went to the Park Ave Fest and walked around, then watched some TV.  Today we went shopping at various locations, including picking Kevin up and going to the Waterloo Outlets.  It was lots of fun, and gave us something to do (even though Kevin had an eventful weekend of birthday parties in Buffalo/Niagara Falls).  Tomorrow begins my first day of work; orientation in the morning on Monday and Tuesday, and work in the afternoons.  Should be exciting, kinda looking forward to having something to do during the day.  Anyway, I'm sure I'll write a little diddy after tomorrow.

        This post is actually from Thursday, July 31...my journal program was messing up and I had to repost:    My heart.  You filled it.  Where there was love,  now are scars and emptiness.  I'm longing for more--  my addiction.  But only pain and lonliness.  Still, thank you.   Anyway, my work meetings were just lovely today, despite the second day of my headache. Overall, everything seems to be going well and on a semi-normal track.

        This post is actually from last Tuesday, July 29...my journal program was messing up and I had to repost:    Yay for a job! I have been offered, and accepted, the job at the Office of the Dean of Students at the University of Rochester. I'll be working 30 hours a week as the receptionist/secretary, and then an additional 10 hours a week doing this new programming stuff with Melissia in the Student Activities Office. Oh my, this is such a relief. I can feel sanity gracing me with its presence!   Anyway, so I immediately call the landlord and he tells me that he had already rented my room out, but that the apartment above mine is available. It is the same exact apartment, so he called the person who rented mine (a graduate student from Arizona who didn't see my place, just saw it on the Internet and rented it) and she agreed to just take 407 instead so I wouldn't have to move. Yay again!   Then, I got a call from a law firm I applied to for a paralegal job, and they wanted me to interview. I declined, but thanked them for offering the interview. It is just strange how that all works at the same time! Actually, its a little frustrating that it all happens on the same day and not any of the other 60 days I was sitting on my butt!   Tonight I'm having a bunch of people over to watch our Tuesday night shows, Boy Meets Boy and Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. They're just too funny. It'll be Stephen, Paul, Byran, Kevin, Carolyn and myself. I think I might just give them all giant hugs as I'm so freakin' excited about the job! Yay!

      Ohh, what a fun Friday night out!  First, Paul, Bryan, and I went to Star Bar, and had some fun there, despite the ridiculous cover that evening.  The drinks were good though.  Mmmm.  We then travelled over to Muther's and met Stephen and the rest of the PN crew, along with most of Rochester.  Yea, a little busy there, but TONS of fun!  Talked to Taylor a bit too, which was nice...always good meeting new people, especially in this town and said situation of not being all that satisfied with it.  Anyway, today has been relaxing.  I needed it.  Last night would have been more fun had I not been so tired, but there is plenty of time to do that today and this evening.  Maybe I'll go see a movie tonight.  Hmm, wonder what everyone is doing...  I talked to Aarthi today too!  She's so fabulous, alas she is in Boston.  I'll have to go visit sometime.  I can't wait!  Ok, my new issue of The Economist is here, so time to read it.  I know, I know, my nerd magazine.  Canada is on the front cover though!  Yay Canada!

      Well that really sucks even more, but at least I know how you feel, for once.  And I guess at least there is some closure.  I wish you all the best hun.  So today at work was crazy.  I wish I could type more here about it, but seeing as how we deal with so much confidential information, I really can't.  Talked to Stephen before coming home from work, which was good...I needed it, and he understands, probably moreso than my other friends.  Then I picked Carolyn up and we got some ice cream, which was also much needed.  And that leaves me here, typing this, while Bryan sits and talks to his mother on the phone, and we wait for Paul (who is not feeling well) to get here to relax.  Its Must See TV night!  Yay!  Tomorrow is a fun night out!  Woohoo!  Next few weekends: --Oct 3-5, Home to get the car fixed.  Possibly going on to Pittsburgh to see Jeff, which could prove to be a change of pace, and a reconnection with an old friend. --Oct 10-12, Meliora Weekend craziness.  Navin will be visiting, so we'll go out and have fun. --Oct 17-19, Open weekend.  Might use this weekend to go to Montreal.  I need out of Rochester, for many different reasons. --Oct 24-26, UR Drag Show, going out this weekend.  May also use this weekend to go to Montreal if I don't make it the prior weekend.  Ok, enough craziness (on soooo many levels).  Ta ta

Friends, what's been left of them lately, are well; enjoying hanging out with them--but that's about it.  Oh, got new jeans, shirt, belt, and shoes. Otherwise, tired.

      Everything is still a-ok here.  Nothing new and/or exciting to report.  Just returned from watching auditions of the student performance groups for Rochester Revue, a show during Meliora Weekend (our school's homecoming/parents weekend).  That went well, and all the groups did just fine--although there were a couple places for improvment, but nothing that couldn't be done with some practice between now and the show (Oct 11).  My car is fixed.  Woohoo.  That only cost $375.25.  What a rip.  And it also needs rear differential fluid replaced, or something like that, at a cost of $85.  Yea, we're waiting on that one, because I can do it much cheaper at home with my father.  Now all I have to do is find a weekend to go home.  I was thinking the first Saturday in October, I'd just do a "go home for the day and drive back" sort of deals.  Ugh, that was a pain last time, but it was nice to get it all out of the way.  Other than that, just hanging out with the usual people.  I wish there was some more time to be had with others, but not everyone has my boring-ass lifestyle of work and nothing.  Anyway, I'll take what time I can get with people, especially those busy school kids (ahem...Stephen, Paul, and especially Kevin).  Hehehe...gotta love them all...fantastic guys.  Now all I need are some weekend plans...I think I'll try to go out one of those evenings; its time for some fun.

      Well, last night Carolyn, Meghan, Bryan, Paul, Stephen, and I went out for a lovely fish fry dinner.  Gotta love the Winfield Grill.  It was good, Carolyn and Meghan had to go back to campus for various RA duties, and Bryan, Paul, Stephen, and I went back to Stephen's and just sat around for a while.  Paul played the saxophone, and Stephen played the violin and piano (not at the same time--that would have been impressive!).  'Twas a good time.  So my car is in the shop until Monday.  The left front brake is sticking, and it will cost about $250 to repair.  Not cool.  Thankfully Friday was payday, although I have a million other things I should be spending money on instead.  Anyway, I'm carless until then, so Bryan is hauling my ass around town.  This morning we went to the public market (if you haven't been, you should go sometime...let me know and I'll go with!) and I got like 10 green peppers, a bag of potatoes, 2 bagels, 6 sticky buns, 5 cloves of garlic, huge head of romaine lettuce, and a pound of colby jack cheese, all for like $12.  Yay!  There's also a Java's there, so its a good place to sit and people watch before shopping.  Good times!  Then, after the market, we went grocery shopping at Pittsford Wegmans.  Note to self: don't purchase any pasta products for many many months...I'll certainly have to make some baked ziti soon.  Tonight is a BBQ at Jason Berger's, and then a housewarming at Katie and Suzanne's.  Should be fun, although it would have been nice if they were on two separate days.  Oh well.  Tomorrow I'm meeting Ali, Joe, Jason, and Sara for brunch, so it will be a nice suite reunion.  Yay!  Talked to Kevin here and there.  I seem to be doing better with this new outlook...so hopefully it will be better.  Ok, time to finish the laundry.  Montreal the last weekend in September?  Hmm...

      Tonight (Monday 9/8) I saw Kevin, watched him play tennis with his friends, and it actually made my evening.  I know it sounds stupid to most other people, but it was quite nice...a moment out of my normal routine of sorts.  Anyway, talked with him as well, and things are better, again, I think/hope.  Like I said before, it has been hard moving to a friendship because we didn't have that before and obviously have two completely different expectations of friendship, so its a matter of understanding each others and possibly meeting in the middle.  Tonight helped me in that I see how he interacts with his friends (which I never really saw before at all), and its just helps to understand what he is saying and that what he has told me about his friendships with others is true.  Ok, so in the past entries, I really really really didn't intend or want to make Kevin sound like an asshole that never calls me or contacts me and was just leaving me in the dust.  The fact of the matter, and what I have tried to explain to him but not quite sure I have successfully without bumbling my words and thought-processes all up, is that have never allowed him the chance or opportunity to come up with things to do, or to contact me.  I have always gotten to this point of being upset, talking to Kevin and my friends, feeling better, and then looping right back around after a week or so and feeling upset again...  Obviously, this cycle of being happy then upset must stop, because I'm going insane otherwise.  So, I have talked with my friends, as I have in the past, but this time I have asked them to help me much more proactively (more on that in a bit...)  I stated earlier that in the past, I haven't allowed time for Kevin to possibly come up with anything to do, or to contact me in any way, so I'm going to wait for action on his side.  Now, I  do not  want this, or intend this, to come off as "well Jason is just pouting and waiting for Kevin to come up with something because if Kevin doesn't then Jason can just blame it on him."  Kevin has assured me each time we have talked that he wants to hang out and that he will still message me; and my gut-instinct says that he is absolutely telling the truth.  So far through all this, my gut-instinct has always been right in the end, its just all the thought-processes and "what-ifs" and "whys" pile up in my brain and take over, therefore causing this ridiculous loop of happiness to unhappiness over and over again.  Rather, I need to allow him the time and chance to contact me and message me, because in the past, after the whole loop of unhappiness happend and we patched things up, I would almost immediately come up with something to do together.  While this doesn't sound all that strange because we're hanging out, it means less to me because it isn't coming from him...is this making sense??  My lord, it is so hard to explain.  ...Basically, it means a lot to me to hang out with Kevin, but it means even  more  to me when he  asks  me to hang out with him, but in the past I haven't allowed him the opportunity to ask and instead have asked him myself, which, in the end, is nice because we hang out (which is what he assures me he wants and likes to do) and by hanging out with me when I ask, he thinks is doing a-ok with me, but in the end it is less fullfilling to me because it wasn't he who showed interest in me by contacting me to hang out.  Oh my God, that was crazy, but I think it sums it up.  My low self-esteem sucks, and it helps when I hang out with people that I enjoy spending time with, but it means even more to me when those people ask me to hang out with them and we do.  (Ok, if that was unclear, please let me know and have me explain it better.)  Anyway, Stephen and Bryan are going to help me proactively...they are going to approach me when I am obviously unhappy and I will divulge said unhappiness to them when asked, and even bring it to their attention if they don't notice.  They are going to help me give Kevin the time and space he needs, and they are going to help me  trust  that Kevin is going to keep in contact and contact me with things to do and times to hang out.  I can't allow stupid things like what has been happening to make me unhappy...I know Kevin's intention is not to wake up every morning, take all his classes and coursework, do all his extracurriculars, work, and make me unhappy.  That last one just doesn't fit in his schedule, trust me.  hehe.  As Stephen says (boy, I hope I am getting this right) "Only I can make myself unhappy", so these things (the things bouncing around in my head--all the possibilities, the "what-ifs", and the "whys") must be dealt with, and that is what I am trying to do...to give time and space, to remain occupied on my own time (i.e. not arrange schedules and time around anyone), to allow things to happen and not attempt to force things to happen with anyone...and there may be more, but its late and time for bed and I could have forgotten parts.  I only hope that my friends, everyone I know, will help me with this...and that my gut-instinct will prevail once again over my brain's "whys" and "what-ifs", as my gut-instict always has in the past in these circumstances (but if my gut-instinct doesn't prevail and I'm not contacted, re-evaluation of this plan and friendship will have to happen, and I won't let any re-evaluation depress me or upset me and cause a jump back to the loop of unhappiness)...and that Kevin will remain friends with me, that the friendship will grow, that we will not drift apart.  I just can't continue subconsiously attempting to force any action or feelings from Kevin.  I must trust Kevin (in general, trust has been a problem with me for a long long time, for reasons I won't go into here...its a whole other novel).  [Ok, too tired to thoroughly proofread or check this all for cohesion, but I think I caught most of my errors in converting thought-processes to type.  I'll try to check it again tomorrow, but if anything seems out-of-whack at anytime, or if I seem out-of-whack, please bring it to my attention (be part of Team Jason!  lol).]

      Talked to Kevin last night, I hope we'll come to understand each other more...I certainly don't mean to make him feel like crap, and I know he doesn't mean to make me feel the way I do.  Overall, I hope to just hear from him slightly more so its not always me initiating things...Its hard moving to the friendship, especially when there wasn't a long-term friendship established beforehand--so we have two completely different expectations of friends, but I hope, as I said in the first sentance, that we will understand each other's expectations and maybe meet in the middle.  Anyway, work is going down the crapper again...I think I have mastered the "look busy but don't do anything" move.  Woohoo, that should make me a real university employee.  Hehe...more to come tonight, as I'm sure Linda will do something wild and crazy that deserves mentioning.

      Well, I dunno.  Nothing much going on here.  Work is ok.  Everyone seems to be doing ok, except for me of course.  You know, the usual crap of the past two months.  What a pain...and its not like I'm purposely thinking of it all the time, its just there, annoying me to death, and its there no matter how much I do to get my mind off of it.  Ughhh.  And to top it all off, I feel pretty damn unappreciated too...I mean, I never get calls from him, very very few people ever ask about my day or how I am doing, and he never calls with any ideas of things to do, either together or with his friends.  Meanwhile, I do that with my friends, and they have actually started to notice the lack of reciprocation and mentioning it.  I dunno, its obvious that we aren't dating anymore (duh!), and we won't be hanging out as much, but there is some common courtesy to be had.  I almost feel used--but it is not quite that serious sounding.  I just feel like it was "Ok, I don't want anything serious (which I still don't quite understand, because if you find someone you claim to love, shouldn't that at least last for a while?  and what were you doing in the relationship anyway and claiming your love to that person?  do you still love that person?  if only as a "friend" how does/did that love change?), and I don't have any sort of problem not thinking of you or getting over you."  And to think that most of this could be helped with kind gestures of appreciation, or some show of concern for one another.  A hug, a kiss on the cheek, a call, an e-mail, a message--and asking questions, showing interest when there is a message, e-mail, or call, goes a long way in my book.  Just because people are dating anymore doesn't mean there should be a complete severing of all emotions between the people.  Again, I don't know, all just random babbling in an attempt to get it out of my fucking head where it bounces around endlessly.  Despite my rambling above, he and his actions (or inaction as I claim above) aren't the real root of the problem, rather its my insecurity about being alone and lost that is the real problem.  I just ask for some help coping with the loneliness.    Ok, so in other news/events...Bryan had his housewarming party yesterday which went well.  Paul is just absolutely hilarious when he's intoxicated, as are most of my friends--but he even moreso.  They went out afterwards, but I came home because I was feeling pretty out of it (see above) and needed to rest anyway.  Today has been dull...Bryan has notified me that we are going to start working out directly after work everyday.  We'll see how long this lasts.  Hopefully I'll just magically get in shape (haha).  I dunno...encouragement is certainly welcome on that front too.  My god...low self-esteem, eh?  Blah!

      So today at work really kicked my ass.  I am soooo tired from work, but determined to go out nonetheless.  I don't know where though.  Today at work, we finally got our copier/printer hooked up to the network, which was nice because I got the leadership award applications printed out much faster than it would have been on my inkjet.  Other than the constant amount of work which has led to me being SO TIRED, it was a good day.  Tomorrow is the John Mayer concert, with tickets I won from the WB station.  How random, I just entered online, never thinking I would win.  I invited Taylor to go, figured it would be something to do.  Tomorrow night is open though, so give a ring if you have ideas.  :-)  Ok, off to call the parents before going out... give a ring guys...

      Yea, so I'll post tonight instead of tomorrow morning at work, as I have stuff I should do right when I get to work.  Bleh.  The rest of work (from my earlier post) went fine.  TGY stopped by as I begged (ok, all I had to do was ask) him to put an event in the Get Out section of the newspaper.  Apparently he passed my boss on the way out, and he came over and the conversation went something like: Boss: So is the CT doing a lot of stories on the Dean of Students Office? Me: Umm, no, why? *puzzled look* Boss: Well I see Taylor was here again.  *smartass, "I know something" smirk* Me: Ah, well, he was here for Fashionably Late event information.  The CT never does stories on this office [sarcasm].  Yea, that's all I need, a rumor at work.  Anyway, the rest of work went fine.  Enjoyed a very quick unscheduled lunch with TGY, and then back to the daily grind.  Moved my cubicle so it was better placed by the door.  Yes, the whole cubicle.  Hopefully now I can catch more people as they come through the door and before they are already in my various boss' offices.  After work I had my eye exam.  It went fine, although the guy fitted me with less-powerful lenses than what I had, even though he had my previous prescription.  Why would you even do that?  I still couldn't see.  Stupid.  Anyway, now we're back to my same ol' prescription, but now with contacts that are one-month disposable, and they are actually more comfortable than my previous two-week disposable.  Very nice.  No plans for the evening, but lots of random things have been happening lately, and that's nice.  I'm tired of a dark cloud hanging over me; I feel like I've moved on very far from a month ago, and even further than 2 months ago, but I feel stagnant and unable to move any more because of this dark cloud.  As if I have gone as far as I can in this storm, and I just want out of it and onto those sunnier times, hopefully with you as a small part of my life.  This unresolved friendship--the anger, the mistrust, the communication issues, the hurt, the pain, among other things--where your friendship was in my heart, now is loneliness and nothingness that will always be there while you are away.  I know we can do better than we did; we know what worked and what didn't; we both allow me to build that trust.  I won't disappoint you.  I know I've said this all before, I just need to get it off my chest occasionally, so to the 2 of you that read (and obviously not the ones that need this), thanks for putting up with that paragraph.  hehe   Current Mood:  Happy, but sick of the rain from this f-ing dark cloud  Current Music:  Saves the Day - Tomorrow Too Late (concert?)

      I am currently at work (where else would I have the time to update from?).  I had to get up at 6:30am to be here at 7:10am to meet the American Red Cross people, who showed up at 8:15am.  Yea.  Not on time.  It sucked, especially since that's the time I usually get here on a normal day.  Whatever, they're all set downstairs draining the blood from the faculty and staff, and maybe a few students.  I can give, for numerous reasons, which is nice.  At this point, I think I need all my blood.  hehehe  Yesterday was a strange day.  I dunno why, it just felt so.  I was pretty "blah" but its mainly because of this weather.  Honestly, just where is that sun?  I guess it is to warm up towards the weekend.  We'll see...  Leaving work yesterday I passed Taylor, who seemed a little pissed/upset about something, so I invited him over for dinner.  We enjoyed some steak (ugh, I'm talking to the butcher next time), potatoes, corn, camaberet and crackers and Blackstone merlot.  Mmmmm.  A lovely de-stressing meal, and good time as always.  Really great company and conversation, and the mediocre dinner.  God, that steak annoyed the hell out of me.  I then took TGY back to campus, and then Bryan came over and watched TV.  After work today I have an appointment at the eye doctor's to get my vision checked for contacts, since the presciption on those ran out and I need more.  Then home to do nothing but sit around, maybe pay some bills.  Nothing too exciting.  Maybe more later...   Current Mood:  Ok  Current Music:  The fizz of my Diet Coke

      What a crazy weekend.  Thursday night I was out with TGY, which I wrote about earlier, so I'll spare you the recap.  Friday night I went out with Bryan and Galen, and it was TONS of fun at Muther's.  Star Bar was a bit less exciting, but we're only there from like 10:30 to 11:45 for the free cover, free drink (super-sized, and oh so good), so maybe people get there later.  Anyway, in the past, I've found that Muther's is the place to be on Friday evening.  Saturday was the UR Drag Show, which went relatively well, then again with Galen and Bryan.  We were at Star Bar from 10:30 to 1am-ish.  It was quite the night, and it was extremely packed--I think the fact that it was the "afterparty" that made it so.  Also, I apparently just missed Kevin there as I was leaving.  I have mixed feelings on that, but won't bother going into them.  Regardless, it was a very nice evening--its already obvious that I would feel better if things were on better terms between us, but at this point I'm just taking things as they come and hopefully he will come back around soon.  One can only hope for some forgiveness.  Anyway, while I was out, I got to see some people that I knew too and that was exciting.  So, Sunday I had breakfast with Galen, Bryan, and Carolyn.  Afterwards, I went to the movies with Thomas and Zeke and saw  Scary Movie 3 .  Your basic parody movie, which was ok.  Then, I went out AGAIN (ugh) to Star Bar with TGY, which was extremely fun, as usual.  Much more calmed than Thursday evening, which is a good thing!  I have no idea what I am doing this week...guess we'll have to see...  Ok, back to work...   Current Mood:  Mixed  Current Music:  Air ducts in office

      Oh, well crap, I just realized that I never wrote about meeting the friend from two years ago on Tuesday.  It was nice, Jeff came over and we had some pizza and watched a movie.  Tons of fun; still a very talkative and energenic person.  Completely different than many of my other friends in Rochester, but that's definitely a good thing.  Variety is the spice of life, so they say.  Right?  I think so...  Anyhoo, hopefully we'll get to hang out some more.

      Well last night was tons of fun!  First I met Bryan and his former boss (now friend) from Baltimore for a drink at the Elmwood.  It was nice, as they have UR students there as bartenders in an attempt to get more UR students to go there and drink.  A nice neighborhood feel was definitely accomplished, then again that's not too hard when its in a place that looks like a cheapy decorated basement.  You know...one of those strange ones with wood paneling and the little bar.  Then I went to pickup TGY and went out for a drink, and met a family friend of his there.  It was extremely nice.  We then went to Star and the intoxication grew.  Let's just say one of us left very very intoxicated, then had to be tended to part of the evening, then more this morning.  *rolls eyes*  Too funny, although somewhat concerning.  Also ate at Highland Park Diner this morning, which was quite delightful, as always.  And I made it to work just on time--9am sharp!  I have a doctor's appointment at 11:15am (what a stupid time slot).  Bleh.  I also made an eye appointment for next Tuesday, as I need a contact-lens exam, and more contacts.  I'm currently wearing two right-eye contacts.  I guess its good that my prescription isn't that far apart.  Saturday is the drag show on campus, which should be interesting as always.  Then out for some fun on the town with Bryan and his friend and whomever cares to join us.  Wooohooo!  Wednesday November 19 is  Saves the Day  with  Taking Back Sunday  here in Rochester (6pm, Harro).  Anyone interested in going?  I figure its a change of pace from the usual routine.  Now I should do some work.  Nahhhhh.   Current Mood:  Amused, Happy, Slightly Concerned, and attemping to be patient.

      I have no intentions.  I know you want distance.  At least that's the last thing I was told, so that's what we'll have.  Please contact me when you're ready for something more than this distance.  I feel that I can't communicate my issues on this to you, because it comes off as clingy or needy, and the last thing I want to do is upset you more.  The last thing I want is for you to burn the bridge (or pages) entirely.  The only thing to know is that while this is working to some extent, it isn't working the best for me; its really wearing on me, and I wish we could try something different (and that's what I feel that I can't say to you).  I think I've had enough time and am ready to slowly try to be actual friends; I guess you haven't, so I'll wait, and I hope to hear from you soon (if ever)--because I know this isn't working out easiest for me (in fact, its the hardest thing ever for me), but if it is the only way to leave open the chance to be your friend on down the road, I'll deal with the difficulties now to enjoy the benefits of friendship later.    The fact of the matter is that I'm trying to move on (relationship-wise, and friendship-wise), but it hit me today that I would be doing so without support of a friend (and I rely heavily on my friendship support)...so in the meantime I'm trying to rely on my 3 other good friends, and various others, as well as making new ones.  Its just difficult for me...very difficult.  Christ I hate this, I hate communicating like this, I hate talking through some screen that makes it sound all jumbled up and confused.  Communication is best done in person with me, and that's what I'm lacking at the moment--that or a person to communicate it for me.  I'm trying to be clear and not cryptic.  I was just chatting with Mindy who explained a past situation she had, and said they didn't talk for months, but now do occassionally.  While that's a somewhat positive outlook, I was just optimistic that we could do better than that.  I suppose that point was passed a while ago.  Earlier I was chatting with Stephen who generally helps me sort out this stuff...you wouldn't know that, though, by this jumbled up mess.  Ugh.  Anyway, I think its bedtime, or time to just drop the issue and forget it.  Who knows...

      It is nice for people at work to notice I'm having a rough day emtionally and mentally.  But pointing out that there's some pain in my eyes really doesn't do much to help other than make me want to break out into tears.  Suggesting the mental health day off is nice, but only makes me feel more crazy, and sitting at home during these situations really doesn't help either.  Life moves on...I guess.  Blah.  If there was one wish I could get granted, it would be to just make things better...hell, even if I could make them half as better...just to see you again and to be friends.  All that I ask is that I not be judged for me or for my actions, real or perceived, for the past three months.  I'm still the same person I was a year ago.

      I feel alone.  I shouldn't, but I do.  I know you tried hard to understand and help me before, and I really do appreciate that.  I'm sorry if/that I did anything to screw things up or hurt you or make you uncomfortable, and I know you don't intend to hurt me.  I just want to get back to a normal friendship, but there are barriers now.  It hurts.  I feel like I've really ruined a good thing, or completely demolished the path to one.  Now its this rocky road that I have to navigate alone--I don't want to go on.  But I don't really know why you feel the way I do, and I know I'm not entitled to that.  I just feel isolated.  Sometimes all you can hope and pray for is another chance--help moving off the rough and rocky road and onto a smoother path.   Current Mood:  Upset, Ill  Current Music:  None

      Woohoo!  Friday!  Yay!  Again, writing from work because its super-boring here in the mornings.  Didn't really do anything last night...I was going to, but that didn't really go anywhere.  Quite unfortunate.  My friendster thing is being slow and stupid.  Friends are there one minute, then not the next.  How screwy...unless they removed me...in which case, that sucks.  I have yet to decide if I am going to Montreal.  I'd  really  like to go, but I also rather not make the drive alone.  I guess no one wants to go.  *sigh*  Hmm, the anxiety and panic attacks haven't happened in a long while--like two weeks or so, which is nice.  It has taken a really long long while for me to get to this point, but I think the realization that my friends have been there for me has helped.  It also helps to know that he has done his best to understand, and deal with it, and to help me do the same.  Like I said, unfortunately it took me a really long time to get back to a normal stage, so feelings ended up getting hurt and distance was/is needed.  Hopefully when we are both ready we can hang out a little--that's what I miss.  Alas, on goes life.  Someone care to travel along?  Or at least provide some entertainment?

      I'm writing from work, where my computer is disconnecting from the network every 10 minutes.  It has been doing this for the past 5 business days, and I'm really getting sick of it doing so, as I can't get much work done (my e-mail is on an exchange server, and my files stored on a server, so the disconnects interrupts all that).  Hopefully someone will fix it soon, although they did try a new network card that didn't solve the problem.  I should probably call the tech guy Eric again and get him moving on this...  Last night was tons of fun.  After working out with Emily at the gym....oh yea, I started going to the gym this Monday.  Mondays and Fridays I go with Paul and Tuesdays and Thursdays are with Emily.  Wednesday is a day off, thankfully.  Ok, so anyway, went to the gym yesterday and had a good workout, then home to sit around and relax some.  Then Taylor came over and we went to Mex for margaritas, as he insisted on defending them from recent slanderous remarks.  It was lots of fun, and I love impromptu stuff like that.  Ok, so maybe I spoke too soon about the impromptu things, as Paul messaged me "we're doing something fun tonight...beware!"  Now I'm scared, especially since this warning was coming from him and Bryan.  Uh oh...  Yesterday Katherine called me, and that was nice.  Seems like everything is going well in D.C. for her.  Wish I could visit...maybe sometime at the beginning of next year.  Well that's enough for now...

      If I could turn back time (no this isn't me bursting into Cher songs again), I would do one of two things: -not go to UR, instead going to a larger school -go to UR, but start out by being more outgoing and meeting more people  Then again, if I had this power I'd be undoing a lot of things further back than 4 years.  But that's life, and it sucks.  You learn from past actions and you try to make changes where possible in the future.  It just sucks even more when that "change" is learning to be more outgoing and meeting more people.  Ok, I'll omit my top 10 list of reasons to hate/leave Rochester (both "should have left pre-job" and "should really leave now").  Surprisingly, none of them have to do with people I know or my friends, its just atmosphere and social stuff.

      Well, hopefully small discussions like that are the first step to building some patchwork of a friendship in which we can both be happy.  I hope he feels the same.  Today is Bryan's birthday, he turns 22.  Stephen, Paul, Bryan, and I are having dinner (for which I am going to be late if I type too much) and then going out on the town.  Wish I had more money to do that with, but oh well.  Tomorrow I think we're all going to go shopping somewhere, I dunno.  Then on Sunday I am driving home and back all in the same day (ewww, I know, but the car needs fixed).  Anyway, I'll write more later...off to Stephen's.  Much love all.

      Its been a somewhat busy day at work.  Everyone is at the Judicial Board Information Session, so I'm basically here with just a couple other staff members who I never really have to do work for anyway.  Therefore, its just me, a phone, a computer, and boredom.  What does this mean?  Job hunting, random tasks around the office, AIM profile reading over and over, chatting with friends, and drinking GALLONS of water.  I also ate too much for lunch today.  1/2 a wrap from the information session lunch that I ordered for everyone, and 1/2 a meatball sub that Jeremy brought in for the office downstairs.  Yummy.  Now maybe my body won't mind not eating little for dinner.  Yea...15 to 20 pounds lost so far, although I don't really see it.  Others have.  Hmm, oh well...not really doing anything to lose the weight.  Maybe its from my brain working overtime worrying about crap all the time.  hehehe  Ummm, ok, I dunno what else to write about.  I thought I had stuff, but since I just helped someone, I've lost track.  Maybe I'll write more later.  Oh!  Yes, so I'm leaving next Wednesday afternoon to go home for Thanksgiving (maybe Thursday morning too).  I'm returning to Rochester Friday afternoon/evening (most likely).  So, after that, feel free to contact me if you're in the Rochester area and want to do something.  I should have the free time, and the money.  If I don't write before break, good luck to those taking finals, and have safe trips home for the Thanksgiving holiday.

      Last night was lots of fun.  I met Brad and went out to see Finding Nemo at the cheapo...wait...thrifty....wait....frugal theater.  Afterwards we chatted a bit, and it was quite nice.  Yay!  Hmm, what else is going on?  I can't really think of anything.  I got a letter back from the one job that I applied to and it made me slightly hopeful that I had a chance getting it.  But, as I've learned from past experiences, my hopes are certainly not set on this job.  Hell, my hopes have been pretty much shattered about most everything.  At least this could be something to look forward to, and maybe an opportunity to get away.  Bleh!  Now all the thoughts about jobs, Rochester, etc are coming back.  Ugh.  Should I continue trying to be polite?  We'll see...  Anyhoo, off to work now.  Chat me there.  Fun times.

      This headache/sickness stuff is starting to wear on my physically.  I think the the weather shifts here in Rochester that have a large role in it.  Anyway, I'm at work, just sitting around.  Most of the workload was this morning, so now its a little bit of a break, which is good, considering I'm not feeling well.  Actually, I'm starving right now, but I have no money and brought no food.  Enh, whatever.  I guess I just want to act civilized in order to help me through all this other stuff that is going on, and is out of control (so it feels).  Not expecting, or asking for anything, just hoping that things could be better than the current situation.  I don't want to feel isolated, or chastised, or worthless; but that is what I'm being made to feel (or as Stephen would say, "allowing myself to feel that way" or something like that), and talking to my friends about these things feeling like they are out of control helps, I just need to be more upfront with everyone when things upset me in order to not feel isolate, chastised, and worthless.  This is certainly just the tip of the iceberg...we'll see...   Current Mood:  failure/sadness/tired, still somewhat optimistic and hopeful

      Well this prooved to be a fairly uneventful weekend, which was good because I shouldn't be spending any money.  Friday evening I went, alone, to see The Matrix Revolutions.  It was nothing fantastic, then could have done a lot more with it than they did.  Then Saturday during the day I went, alone, to see Elf.  I was in the mood for some Will Ferrell humor, and it was a fairly entertaining movie.  Saturday evening Bryan came over and we watched Finding Nemo that he rented from Blockbuster.  I love that movie, its so funny.  It also brings back memories of better times with some.  Sunday I went with Paul, Stephen, and Bryan to brunch.  It was ok, nothing fantastic, especially since Stephen forgot his wallet and he was going to cover his and Paul's part of the check.  Yea, not cool.  So I covered their portion as well, which took a large chunk out of the $60 that I budgeted for myself for the next two weeks.  Then Bryan and I went out later on to get some wings and beer at the Elmwood (yum!) and then I went for coffee with Thomas and Zeke, which was quite enjoyable.  Slowly building up the friend support network again, although there's that huge gaping hole still.  Hopefully that will be patched up soon.  I have this strange feeling that I'm going to need this support network soon because something traumatic is going to happen, although I can't imagine what that could possibly be at this point.  Probably just a general paranoia with having this crumbling support base.  Thanksgiving is coming up.  I'm thinking of doing a pre-Thanksgiving dinner for a ton of people.  I dunno, maybe instead of a dinner doing a gathering of some sort.  We'll see.  I have very little idea of invitees for it.  Blah.  Not much to be thankful for at this point anway.

      Christmas was fine.  Nothing special, really.  Money, digital camera, and too much eating.  Its just a generally crappy time of year, but I made the most of it.  Now I am back in Rochester and I've been extremely tired for some reason.  Wednesday I am driving to Brockville, Ontario to get John, and then heading with him to Kingston, Ontario for a New Years Eve party.  Should be interesting, and fun.  Plus, who can resist seeing Soules in his No Frills uniform...maybe I can get a bathroom change out of it.  hehe  Anyway, no one is around in Rochester, so it will certainly be something to do.  Then I go back to Montreal on January 9 to 11.  That should be fun times.  John, Chris, and I are going to go shopping and spend some Christmas money.  Woohoo!  I also need to check with a couple people to see if they want to come along...it would be nice to have at least one person, but we'll see.  Soules is pushing for a certain person.  haha, I dunno about that.  No matter who it is, part of me thinks it would be nice, the other part of me rather go alone then I don't have to worry about the other person and what they want to do.  Yea, slightly self-centered when it comes to vacations.  Ok, I think its couch time.  Yea, the bed is still slightly intimidating, but at this point its moreso because my back has been molded to the bed.  hehehe  I'll try to update more, methinks.

       Last night was dinner with Bryan, Stephen, Carolyn, Megan, Alison, and Paul at the Winfield Grill.  It was the usual--really good.  Mmmmm.  Then it was off to Star Bar, early so we didn't have to pay the cover, and there was some NYC DJ playing.  Didn't really see much of a difference there.  It's great to walk into a bar and have the bartender see you in the mirror walking in and start shouting, "No!  Go away!"  Gotta love him.  Anyway, a nice relaxing evening there (strangely enough with all the music and people).  Played a couple games of pool against Ciara (I think that's how she spells her name).  I didn't realize that she graduated with me.  Brad was there too, although he had to pay the $10 cover.  That sucks.  And the morning was topped off with a Tip Top breakfast.  Yum.  - Doing Dr. Pepper shots even though you're told that they were not good - Jager bombs.  Mmmm - Yay dancing.  (bleh, usually) - "Take off your shirt!"

Then, the facilities people are leaving the one door unlocked, which is a slight security risk considering the discipline records are in our office.  Fucking morons.  So, they got an e-mail shot off to their director, and the director of security.  Then I went to get Indian food with Paul, which was nice.  Yea, dunno much there...

      Wow.  Yesterday was quite the fun night.  First I went to dinner with Tim, and then watched a movie.  It was a fairly enjoyable time.  Then Paul and I decided that we were bored, but that going out for a drink wouldn't hurt.  Somewhere where we could sit and relax.  Well we ended up at Star Bar (which isn't meant for one drink, and there's no sitting or relaxing), arrived around midnight, and then like 8 to 10 drinks later (mind you, it was double strength drink night), befriending the bartender (Chris), getting free shots, and just living it up.  Wow.  I mean, wow.  Wow.  I can't even begin to type about it all.  And hey, we got to see Crazy Dancing Asian Guy, and Chris informed us that Crazy Dancing Asian Guy's proper name is the "Asian Sensation."  Haha, we also got a cute re-enactment of his dancing skills too.  :-)  Notes: - Chris isn't crazy, just retarded - gravity taking its toll on walking abilities - "It's reciprocal!" and a poorly drawn smiley face - straw up nose - the shower curtain (yick) - Paul wondering where his car is parked (asked while Paul was IN his car and I was parking it) - tastes like _____! (XXX rated) - tastes like Dr. Pepper, and its on fire - phonesex - $40 or 40 blowjobs? ...probably more added soon...  So then Paul and I met Erica, Sara, and Carolyn out for breakfast at Tip Top.  I ate sooooo much, but it cured the hangover, so I guess its all good.  Our waitress was a little crazy too.  Overall, a good start to the weekend.

Plus word on the street is that Chris got frostbite, so I rather avoid that medical problem for myself.  Brad is back in town, so we've been hanging out a bit.  And tomorrow I am going to dinner with Tim, and it will be nice to see him again.  Hmmm...dunno what to say or do here, but we'll see.  mahnamana!  hehe.  That just cracks me up.  Ohh!  I got the massive data entry job done at work.  Thank God!  It's soooooo nice, and now, I have this urge to go  back  to work.  It'll be nice not having that huge project looming over my desk.

      Well, it has been a while since I have put anything here.  I think I'm losing motivation to write things, so this will probably be short.  Friday night, my friends and I just sat around and enjoyed some drinking, movies, and board games.  It was too damn cold to go out on the town, so the night in was a nice change of pace.  Last night, Bryan and I met the SAO crew at Bingo World (El mundo del bingo!  Los Estados Unidos del bingo!  Suuuuper bingo!).  It was fun, and only cost $7, plus a $1 more if you don't have a dobber.  Needless to say, I left with dobber battle scars, and no winnings.  Oh well.  The one pot was $1200!  Whoaaaa!.  It began at 7:30 and ended at 9:15, so its not even like it takes up the whole evening.  We'll have to go back soemtime.  After bingo, we went to  urlLink The Old Toad  for Katie Moore's birthday, but only stayed for a drink.  I came home, and fell asleep before SNL even started.  Doh!  But now it is Sunday and I don't really have plans to do anything.  Maybe someone will finally call me back and want to do something, but I know that I'm kinda done trying from my end for a while.

        The case for gay marriage     Feb 26th 2004  From  urlLink The Economist  print edition    It rests on equality, liberty and even society  So at last it is official: George Bush is in favour of unequal rights, big-government intrusiveness and federal power rather than devolution to the states. That is the implication of his announcement this week that he will support efforts to pass a constitutional amendment in America banning gay marriage. Some have sought to explain this action away simply as cynical politics, an effort to motivate his core conservative supporters to turn out to vote for him in November or to put his likely “Massachusetts liberal” opponent, John Kerry, in an awkward spot. Yet to call for a constitutional amendment is such a difficult, drastic and draconian move that cynicism is too weak an explanation. No, it must be worse than that: Mr Bush must actually believe in what he is doing.  Mr Bush says that he is acting to protect “the most fundamental institution of civilisation” from what he sees as “activist judges” who in Massachusetts early this month confirmed an earlier ruling that banning gay marriage is contrary to their state constitution. The city of San Francisco, gay capital of America, has been issuing thousands of marriage licences to homosexual couples, in apparent contradiction to state and even federal laws. It can only be a matter of time before this issue arrives at the federal Supreme Court. And those “activist judges”, who, by the way, gave Mr Bush his job in 2000, might well take the same view of the federal constitution as their Massachusetts equivalents did of their state code: that the constitution demands equality of treatment. Last June, in Lawrence v Texas, they ruled that state anti-sodomy laws violated the constitutional right of adults to choose how to conduct their private lives with regard to sex, saying further that “the Court's obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate its own moral code”. That obligation could well lead the justices to uphold the right of gays to marry.   Let them wed  That idea remains shocking to many people. So far, only two countries—Belgium and the Netherlands—have given full legal status to same-sex unions, though Canada has backed the idea in principle and others have conferred almost-equal rights on such partnerships. The sight of homosexual men and women having wedding days just like those enjoyed for thousands of years by heterosexuals is unsettling, just as, for some people, is the sight of them holding hands or kissing. When The Economist first argued in favour of legalising gay marriage eight years ago (“Let them wed”, January 6th 1996) it shocked many of our readers, though fewer than it would have shocked eight years earlier and more than it will shock today. That is why we argued that such a radical change should not be pushed along precipitously. But nor should it be blocked precipitously.  The case for allowing gays to marry begins with equality, pure and simple. Why should one set of loving, consenting adults be denied a right that other such adults have and which, if exercised, will do no damage to anyone else? Not just because they have always lacked that right in the past, for sure: until the late 1960s, in some American states it was illegal for black adults to marry white ones, but precious few would defend that ban now on grounds that it was “traditional”. Another argument is rooted in semantics: marriage is the union of a man and a woman, and so cannot be extended to same-sex couples. They may live together and love one another, but cannot, on this argument, be “married”. But that is to dodge the real question—why not?—and to obscure the real nature of marriage, which is a binding commitment, at once legal, social and personal, between two people to take on special obligations to one another. If homosexuals want to make such marital commitments to one another, and to society, then why should they be prevented from doing so while other adults, equivalent in all other ways, are allowed to do so?   Civil unions are not enough  The reason, according to Mr Bush, is that this would damage an important social institution. Yet the reverse is surely true. Gays want to marry precisely because they see marriage as important: they want the symbolism that marriage brings, the extra sense of obligation and commitment, as well as the social recognition. Allowing gays to marry would, if anything, add to social stability, for it would increase the number of couples that take on real, rather than simply passing, commitments. The weakening of marriage has been heterosexuals' doing, not gays', for it is their infidelity, divorce rates and single-parent families that have wrought social damage.   But marriage is about children, say some: to which the answer is, it often is, but not always, and permitting gay marriage would not alter that. Or it is a religious act, say others: to which the answer is, yes, you may believe that, but if so it is no business of the state to impose a religious choice. Indeed, in America the constitution expressly bans the involvement of the state in religious matters, so it would be especially outrageous if the constitution were now to be used for religious ends.  The importance of marriage for society's general health and stability also explains why the commonly mooted alternative to gay marriage—a so-called civil union—is not enough. Vermont has created this notion, of a legally registered contract between a couple that cannot, however, be called a “marriage”. Some European countries, by legislating for equal legal rights for gay partnerships, have moved in the same direction (Britain is contemplating just such a move, and even the opposition Conservative leader, Michael Howard, says he would support it). Some gays think it would be better to limit their ambitions to that, rather than seeking full social equality, for fear of provoking a backlash—of the sort perhaps epitomised by Mr Bush this week.   Yet that would be both wrong in principle and damaging for society. Marriage, as it is commonly viewed in society, is more than just a legal contract. Moreover, to establish something short of real marriage for some adults would tend to undermine the notion for all. Why shouldn't everyone, in time, downgrade to civil unions? Now that really would threaten a fundamental institution of civilisation.

      Another from  urlLink Bill    "And finally, New Rule: Southerners have to at least consider voting for candidates from the North. North Carolina Senator John Edwards has a powerful argument in his bid to be the Democratic nominee when he says, "What I give people is a candidate who can win everywhere in America." Translation: "We Southerners ain't gonna vote for no Yankee." "You suckers up north will take our Clintons and Carters, but we just ain't buyin' Kerrys and Deans."   "And that's a shame, not just for Democrats, but for democracy itself. And I feel bad for the millions of intelligent people who live in a region still dominated by so much prejudice that anyone who wants to be president better have a twang in his voice and pronounce all for "e's" in the word "shit."   "I'm sorry, but responding only to people who look and sound like you is small-minded. So if Southerners don't want to have an inferiority complex, I say, stop doing things that make reasonable people think you're inferior. Like getting rid of slavery was a good start. But don't stop there. Stop being the place that's always challenging the theory of evolution.   "What's next to challenge? Gravity? Is that just a plot by the Jews up north to get people to drop spare change?   "And I like the South. I love to party there. But Southerners need to let go of the Civil War, beginning with those re-enactments. First of all, you're re-enacting something you lost. It's one thing - it's one thing to gloat about victory, but when you do it about losing, your front porch is a few couches short of being decorated.   "The time has come to move on. The time has come to consider - just consider - voting for a Yankee. Howard Dean's Vermont and John Kerry's Massachusetts are no longer where carpetbaggers come from. Carpet munchers, yes. That, we have established.   "But there is no good reason that America, at this late date, still needs to be a house divided. At bottom, we all want the same things: dignity, security and someone to slap the shit out of Janet Jackson.

       urlLink Congress Is Urged to Pass Amendment to the Constitution  (NY Times article, you may need to register, which is free)  I enjoy  urlLink Bill Mahr's show on HBO .  Its pretty amusing, especially each week's  urlLink New Rules .  Here is a transcript from a New Rule on the February 13th episode:   "And finally, New Rule, Special Valentine's Day Edition: You can't claim you're the party of smaller government and then make laws about love. On this occasion of this Valentine's Day, let's stop and ask ourselves what business is it of the state how consenting adults choose to pair off, share expenses and eventually stop having sex with each other. And why does the Bush Administration want a Constitutional amendment about weddings? Hey, why stop at weddings? Birthdays are important; let's put them in the great document. Let's make a law that gay people can have birthdays, but straight people get more cake. You know, to send the right message to kids.   "Republicans are always saying we should privatize things like schools, prisons, Social Security. Hey, how about we privatize privacy? Because if the government forbids gay men from tying the knot, what is their alternative? They can't all marry Liza Minnelli.   "You know, Republicans used to be the party that opposed social engineering. But now they push programs to outlaw marriage for some people and encourage it for others. If you're straight, there's a billion-five in the budget to promote marriage, but gay marriage is opposed because it threatens or mocks or does something to the "sanctity" of marriage, as if anything you can do in Vegas, drunk off your ass in front of an Elvis impersonator, could be considered sacred.   "Half the people who pledge eternal love are doing it because one of them is either knocked up, rich or desperate. But in George Bush's mind, marriage is only a beautiful lifetime bond of love and sharing. Kind of like what his dad has with the Saudis. Please, I kid.   "All right, but at least the right wing aren't hypocrites on this issue. They really believe that homosexuality is an abomination and a dysfunction that's curable. They believe that if a gay man just devotes his life to Jesus, he'll stop being gay, because that theory worked out so well with the Catholic priests.   "But I have to tell you, the greater shame in this story goes to the Democrats, because they don't believe homosexuality is an abomination. And therefore, their refusal to endorse gay marriage is hypocrisy. Their position doesn't come from the Bible. It's ripped right from the latest poll, which says most Americans are against gay marriage.   "Well, you know what? Sometimes most Americans are just wrong. And where is the Democrat who will stand up and go beyond the half measures of "civil union" and "hate the sin, love the sinner" and say loud and clear, "There is no sin; it's not an abomination and no one can control how cupid aims his arrows. And the ones who pretend they can usually turn out to be the biggest freaks."   "The law in this country should reflect that some people are just born 100% outrageously, fabulously, undeniably, Fire Island gay! And they do not need reprogramming. They need a man with a slow hand!   And that's all I feel like saying about that at the moment.

      Last night was the final Sex and the City episode.  Makes me kind of sad that I didn't watch the show for the first 4 seasons.  I suppose I could rent them on DVD if I really wanted to, but I think I'll just let the whole thing slip into the past.  It was fun times, lots of booze, food, and fun.  The best part was definitely the people.  Good stuff.  Photos are in the album.    urlLink    Sara re-enacting her fall into Stephen's lap.  Funny as hell.   Moving on.  You know what really bothers me?  When people speculate about other people.  Grow up, not everything is scandal.  So I'm at work and successfully avoiding it, for now.  Stephen just stopped by and I showed him the photos.  Woohoo.  Tonight is the season finale of those annoying Fox reality shows "The Littlest Groom" and "My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance."  Yea, I know, I'll probably end up watching them.  It's sad, really.  But tomorrow is another American Idol (yay!) and QEftSG (double yay!).  Ok, work time.

      The past couple days have been mildly stressful.  On Monday, I had about 238 applications for student life awards to send out.  Thankfully I got that all done on Monday, but I busted my ass to make it so.  So then I awaken Tuesday with a bad headache, more congestion, and the general blahs.  Since everyone has been getting sick at work and taking 3 days off because of it, I decided to stay home as a preemptive strike against sickness.  That was good because it gave me a chance to get a lot done, such as: groceries, car wash/cleaning, BJ's membership, clean apartment.  Yea, there is something about being sick and cleaning, I've found that it helps me get better, faster.  Probably because all those germs and dust are not sitting around.  Then again, maybe its just in my head.  Later that evening, Paul stopped over to watch American Idol and various other shows.  Stephen came over to talk, while he ate and sat strangely on the couch.  I think a lot was clarified, which is good.  Queer Eye came on and we all watched it.  Woohoo, new episodes!  Stephen left for bed, and I forced myself to stay awake for the Family Guy and Futurama with Paul.  Fun times, good shows.  I want to go visit John and Chris.  I want someone to go with me.

      Well, what a not-so-thrilling weekend.  Feels stagnant.  Friday went out with a TON of people--Carolyn, Bryan, Paul, Erica, Sara, Dave, Brad, Laura, and others.  We met at Star and had fun drinking, dancing, and watching the first show.  Also got to see Chris and Roy.  They're such nice guys.  Kevin was there too with his friends, and it appeared they were having fun.  That is always nice to see, even though we're not exactly getting along still.  Anyway, most of the ladies left for the Senior Night at Pour (what a stupid name for a club), and then Laura, Paul, Bryan, and I went to Muther's at like 12:30.  It was actually MUCH more fun than Star, which is somewhat disappointing because Star has a better atmosphere and drinks, but there is just something about the people at Muther's that makes it better.  I think its a maturity level, with the ages still about the same as Star.  Yea, ok, that probably didn't make much sense....whatever, it does to me.  So after Muther's (again, SO MUCH FUN), we went to Taco Bell (bleh), then I took everyone home.  Saturday I went to bfast with Alison and Paul, and then met Brian and went to see that new Adam Sandler movie, "50 First Dates."  It was a typical Adam Sandler movie--nothing too thrilling, but ok.  Brian also made me a Family Guy DVD, which is working better than my other ones.  I've already watched all of them.  hehehe  Saturday night Paul and I went to Sinbad's for dinner, and then met a bit later to go to the Pump party at Tonic.  I wasn't too impressed with the whole thing, but I guess it was something to do.  Alison went with us as well, so it was added fun.  There were also some random people there, like Jen from the Alumni House.  Strange.  But RJ and Ryan were there too.  Ok, I'm kinda craving some breakfast.  Where are my Tip Top people?

       So yesterday I went to see Dan's play,  Once Upon a Mattress , with Jeremy.  The play was hilarious and overall a good time.  I got home at 4:30pm-ish and talked to Ryan and we went to dinner to Bru, which is where Empire Brewing Co. used to be in the High Falls area.  It was an ok place, kinda slow on the kitchen side, but manageable.  A fantastic time overall though, as I really like spending time with Ryan because he's nice, talkative, and interesting...which doesn't come along too often when meeting new people.  Hopefully we can hang out some more.  Fun times.  Anyway, after that, I came home and Laura messaged me and said that they were all going to be at Star Bar.  So I got there, saw Chris (keep those drinks rolling Bartender/Security Guard extraordinaire Woodworth), and Paul and Paul came, and then Ryan was there with his one roommate.  Drank, danced up a storm, yada yada yada.  After getting my kiss goodbye (hehe), I left at like 1am, went out to the lot where I was parked in, so went back to the bar for like 30 minutes, and by that time the lot had cleared so I left.  Yea, that lot was the only shitty thing that night.  Yay for fun!  So today I scrubbed the apartment down, and then went to Target for a couple items.  Now I'm determined to use the rest of the day to relax.     Current Mood:  Content  Current Music:  Boulevard East, "Let Me Feel Your Arms Around Me"

      Ok, now for a brief "real" entry.  Nothing much really going on.  I am organizing, somewhat, information in order to move.  Yea, I need to save money, and the chance of doing that is far exceeding the alone lifestyle.  Hopefully something will work out, I have a placed lined up to look at, and information on getting out of my current lease is in the mail.  So...anyone interested in a studio apt near Park Ave and Monroe Ave for $540 a month, all utilities and parking included??  I'll sublet to you for March/April to August 31 (when my lease is up).  No, seriously, let me know.  It's a nice place, just not in my budget range anymore.  Work is going ok.  I had an interview for another position, but I don't think I want that job now--unless the pay is substantially more, which I don't expect it to be.  At the very least, it was some interview practice for me, which I need.  Hmm.  Ok, I think that's all for now.  I kinda have a headache, and am tired.  Not sure why.

      So, yea.  Nothing eventful really going on.  I have been killing time by hanging out with friends.  On Friday night, the whole pack of us went to Star Bar.  It was lots of fun.  Kevin was there with his group of friends.  It was really nice seeing him and also Jamie.  It was so good to see everyone happy and doing their thing.  I felt good at the end because the whole thing wasn't awkward, and at the end of the evening when I said it was nice seeing him, he said it was nice seeing me.  That's all I was ever hoping for...I  mean, we could be better friends, but at this point, I feel good about this.  He was a huge part of my development and life, and I will never forget him, and will always be here for him.  I hope he feels the same about me.  I love him, and I love all my friends.  They really are what keeps me going a lot of the time.  Whoa, how the hell did February get here so fast?  Ahh, I can barely read my computer screen now because the sun is glaring through the window and blinds.  What a welcome change from the overcast weather Rochester usually has.  We have had 100 inches of snow so far this winter.  Blah.  I need to use the digital camera more and get pictures.  Maybe some more later...but for now, Alison is calling about bfast.  So off I go...   Current Mood:  Happy  Current Music:  Some pre-game show for the Super Bowl.  Is it just me, or is this even really overdone now?

See a difference (other than sheer length)?  See how Bush's seems to cater towards some key interests?  What a dumb fuck.  GOD I HATE THAT MAN.

      Today was "Operation Clean House for Ryan."  Its sooooo spotless here.  Crazy.  I purchased the Swiffer dusters today.  They worked great on my blinds.  I apologize for saying they are the downfall of American society.  I still hate the floor system from Swiffer though.  Get a mop and bucket, people.  Also got groceries and returned bottles and cans.  Woohoo!  So yea, tonight going out to the Pump party.  The last one sucked, but we're giving it another shot.  Hopefully it won't disappoint.  The Al Franken book is going really well.  I recommend it.

      Well, today was quite the day from hell.  Had the student life award selection meeting, which took up all my time at work.  Normally that would be a good thing, but its time-consuming, and now I have to plan the reception and all that.  I've just been too busy to think lately...for the past month its been work, rest, work, rest, work, rest...and then fitting friends in between.  Ugh.  After work I went with Brian to see  Elephant  at The Little.  Interesting movie, it brings up a lot of good points.  It was fairly disturbing though, and I think I rather avoid talking about it at length.  After the movie, we came back here for a little bit, but finally got in contact with Bryan and the gang, so we went to his place and hanged out for a little.  Then, me being a little tired, we left.  Good times though, I've just had my limit of people for the day.  hehehe  My new book from Amazon.com arrived...its Al Franken's newest release.  Good read, so far.  Can't wait to continue, which I'll probably do after I'm done here.  Tomorrow I'm going out on the town with Ryan, and maybe a couple other people who join up.  Should be fun, I like hanging out with him, and I guess the other people aren't that bad either ;-)  Ohh!  and I got a chance to talk to Soules today.  Gotta love him and his Canadian hijinx.  He's doing a "peace building class."  This does not surprise me, it seems like something they would teach in Canada.  Anyway, I'm off to chat with Brian and try to stop being concerned and upset about stupid little things that I have no idea about.  Yea...I know.  Blah.  Maybe I'll just read...we'll see.

      Chatting today made me feel good.  I mean, things could obviously be better, don't get me wrong...but I truly care for you, and talking occassionally feels good.  I know the history really sucks, but I hope you keep in touch every now and then; I'm here when needed, and still care for you, like all my friends.

      So, the weekend was so-so.  Nothing that exciting.  Went out with the gang on Friday, and that was ok.  A few things I was less than impressed with, but by this time I should honestly be used to them.  Saturday I did nothing all day.  I can't even thing of one thing I did.  Oh, I saw Mystic River that day, and ordered pizza.  Wow, thrilling.  Good movie, by the way.  Sunday I had planned on doing the same, but then Ryan messaged and we ended up going to breakfast at Jine's, and then to Spot, and then realized there was a sale at the mall, so we went there.  It was lots of fun, and he got some new clothes, which accentuate all the right areas.  (insert winks here)  Anyway, work is going fine...I'm escorting Michael Jackson around campus.  No, not that one.  This is the VP of Student Affairs at USC, here for the reaccreditation of our University.  Fun times.     Current Mood:  Enh

       urlLink Cash Flow Generator   Ok, so I awakened to these small-people (what do they want to be called nowadays, and do I hypenate that?) on TV at 5:30am talking about this.  I thought I had gone to hell, because hell is surely where midgets are generally accepted for their keen sense of financial and real estate markets.  So I went back to sleep on the couch, but not after turning it to Bob Vila's Home Again.  Yea, I know, an alternate hell, but at least it was better than midgets trying to act smart.  p.s. I have nothing against small-people, but these ones were obviously lacking credentials of any sort.  Just read the website.

      I'm sorry, some people really just don't get it.  This time, I'm not going to play the part of the guy who is always around to hang out...for people to come back to when they come up with the time.  My priorities might be different and might include my friends first (seeing as how they  are  my family, basically), but this doesn't make my priorities entirely incompatible with others.  It has happened far too much the past year.  There's a happy medium, but when all I see is an inability to find the common ground on another's part, then I have no time to reserve for that person.  Sorry, but when this happens, I'll have to turn down the part of the ugly friend who can't get his own date and who is around whenever you need someone.  I rather put my time and efforts into those who are more interested in me than some service I can provide them in their time of need.  Have a good one.

      Today was my first day back at work from vacation.  Oh man, there was so much stuff piled on my desk.  First, the Urban Fellows applications...well, when they came in when I was gone, instead of organizing them with materials that may have already arrived for each applicant, my co-workers just tossed them in a folder for me to sort.  Yay.  Then the Student Life Awards...wow, what a pain.  Just a big organizational mess, but its taken care of now.  The morning and beginning of the afternoon was crazy with all this stuff leftover.  Anyway, then Alison stopped by to say Hi.  It's always nice when people stop by unexpectedly.  :-)  After work, I came home and showered, and then Ryan got here and we went out to dinner.  I had an exceptionally good time, which has been quite quite rare lately.  We went to the Macaroni Grill.  Mmmm, I love it there.  The company made the meal though.  Good times.  Sidenote: they completely redid the inside of that restaurant, there are like booths and all this craziness going on now.  I just saw a really good presentation today on Heinz condiment packets, how random.  hehehe  Ahh, the days of college-work.  How I don't miss them.  So how did I do this before?

      Well, the vacation went very well.  I had a fantastic time seeing Navin in NYC.  We went to the  urlLink Brooklyn Museum of Art ,  urlLink Avenue Q , and other fun things.  I highly recommend Avenue Q.  I also got a nice new lightweight Kenneth Cole jacket from Macy's.  Just what I was looking for!  I also got to see my friend from high school, Andrew, on Sunday evening.  It was really nice, just sitting around and catching up over some beer.  Lots of beer.  Lots of fun.  Then on Monday I flew to Oakland, California where Paul picked me up at the airport.  We then drove into San Francisco and stayed at the Sheraton on Fisherman's Wharf.  Ate a fabulous dinner at  urlLink Ghiradelli Square  in  urlLink McCormick and Kuleto's .  Oh god was that food was good.  Anyway, drove and walked the city a little.  It was a lot of fun, and very relaxing.  I definitely want to go back sometime soon, even though I've been assured the weather is rarely as nice as it was when we were there (low 70s, not a cloud in the sky).  Tuesday we started our cross country drive.  First night was in  urlLink Rock Springs, Wyoming .  Second night was in  urlLink Salina, Kansas .  Third night was in  urlLink Bloomington, Indiana  with my friend Mindy.  She's fabulous, and it was really nice to see her and for her to let us crash at her place.  All in all,  Paul drove a lot.  I did all of Nevada and Colorado.  Missouri sucks.  Kansas is brown, a straight drive, and boring.  Ohio got a real boost on my list (I used to really hate it, now I'm indifferent).  Indiana is nice, Illinois I have no opinion on, Colorado isn't all that colorful as they claim on their sign, Wyoming is some foreign planet terrain, Nevada is America's gravel yard, and California was quite nice.  Anyway, not much really to write about.  It was a good time, very relaxing.  Paul and I got along quite well, at least I think.   Hmm...well, he'd say if something bothered him.    Ok, pics are in the album.  I'm looking forward to relaxing a little this weekend, maybe hang out with some people here I haven't seen in a while.  Ryan, Brian, Bryan, Stephen, Alison...oh my!

      Thanks to Paul for e-mailing this article:   Scientists counter Bush view Families varied, say anthropologists  Charles Burress, Chronicle Staff Writer Friday, February 27, 2004 ©2004  urlLink San Francisco Chronicle    The primary organization representing American anthropologists criticized President Bush's proposed constitutional ban on same-sex marriage Thursday and gave a failing grade to the president's understanding of human cultures.   "The results of more than a century of anthropological research on households, kinship relationships and families, across cultures and through time, provide no support whatsoever for the view that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon marriage as an exclusively heterosexual institution," said the executive board of the 11,000-member American Anthropological Association.   Bush has cast the union between male and female as the only proper form of marriage, or what he called in his State of the Union address "one of the most fundamental, enduring institutions of our civilization."   American anthropologists say he's wrong.   "Rather, anthropological research supports the conclusion that a vast array of family types, including families built upon same-sex partnerships, can contribute to stable and humane societies," the association's statement said, adding that the executive board "strongly opposes a constitutional amendment limiting marriage to heterosexual couples."   The statement was proposed by Dan Segal, a professor of anthropology and history from Pitzer College in Claremont (Los Angeles County), who called Bush's conception of the history of marriage "patently false."   "If he were to take even the first semester of anthropology, he would know that's not true," said Segal, a member of the anthropological association's Executive Committee.   Ghita Levine, communications director for the association, said the issue struck a nerve in the profession.   "They feel strongly about it because they are the people who study the culture through time and across the world," she said. "They are the people who know what cultures consist of."   Segal pointed to "sanctified same-sex unions in the fourth century in Christianity" and to the Greeks and Romans applying the concept of marriage to same-sex couples, not to mention the Native American berdache tradition in which males married males.   UC Berkeley anthropologist Laura Nader, an expert in anthropology and the law who played no role in drawing up the association's statement, called it a "correct assessment."   Nader, who is an association member, said Bush's proposal "serves the views of the religious right, and that has to do with getting votes."

Got up at 6:30, took Sarah (Ryan's roommate) to the Buffalo Airport, got to work at 9:45am, worked, lunch with Paul, more work, mall with Bryan and Stephen, new shirt from Guess (yay!), home just in time to meet Alison and watch American Idol, this horrible new Eden show on Fox, and Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.  Family Guy, Futurama, Couch.  Yay!  Today is going ok so far, still wrapping up stupid projects for before I leave on break.  I'm also successfully avoiding really dumb things that people are asking me to do, usually by convincing them (without their knowledge) that they should do them.  I think I've finally perfected that craft.  Sleeeeeepy.  Tonight: Laundry, relaxation, and TV.

      The weekend was moderately eventful.  Went out with Paul on Friday night...Alison crapped out on us, but she was tired and I certainly don't blame her for wanting to sleep.  Saturday I stayed in and watched the movie "Camp" with Stephen, Alison, and Paul.  It was...interesting, and funny.  Sunday Brian came over and we watched "Blazing Saddles", and then we had a last-minute dinner with Paul.  Sunday evening I went to Stephen's for an Academy Awards watching.  Fun times.  Last night, I slept a full night in my bed for the first time in about 6 months.  Crazy, I know.  Oh god was that bed so comfortable, and the alarm was convently located near me for easy snooze-buttoning.  The snooze is getting out of hand though; I need to start waking up at 7:30am again and getting to work at a decent time, especially with all this time I am taking off.  Ryan called yesterday and asked me if I could take his roommate Sarah to Buffalo Airport on Tuesday.  I'm a nice guy, so I said yes.  I get her from RIT tomorrow morning at 7:30am.  Her flight isn't until Noon, but that at least means I only have to miss an hour of work by taking her early.  I also changed my return flight from NYC to Rochester to land me in Oakland, California instead.  It is going to be one busy week--leaving Friday at 5pm for NYC ( urlLink flight 43 ), seeing Navin there (and maybe Stephen in concert too!) and  urlLink Avenue Q  on Broadway, and then leaving on Monday morning at 10:30am for Oakland ( urlLink flight 85 ), where Paul will pick me up and we'll begin the cross country trip with his van.  Someone isn't getting any action driving a Dodge Caravan around town.  Can you say Soccer Mom?  ...or Pedophile?  hehe  So when I am away, its going to be somewhat busy at work.  The  urlLink Student Life Awards  are due on Friday March 5 at Noon, but that whole next week they will need to be copied and delivered to the committee.  I'm not sure how much I trust the others to get this done.  They need to get used to doing the stupid little tasks again anyway.  Speaking of all this, I should get back to work and make sure things are organized for when I leave.

      You know what's really cool?  When you leave work at 11am, go to your car, and see the driver's side window smashed out.  Hotness.  Really.  I mean, just what I wanted to deal with when its going to rain (possibly snow) and I only have $22 to my name.  Yah, that's just really fucking hot.  Nothing was stolen.  At least steal something!  Called Security, which, took forever to send someone, even though I saw him sitting in his car about 100 yards away from me.  He took a report, asked if anyone was out to get me (I don't think so...are you?).  Then I called Rochester Police Department to file a report with them.  Yea, so University of Rochester isn't in their system?!  What the fuck?!  And since when do parking lots have addresses?  She was pretty adamant that it would have an address.  So now my father is calling the insurance company, and I've got some  urlLink hot digital pictures  of this.  Called the glass place, and its $220.26 cash (rates different with insurance obviously) to have it replaced.  And I hate being so poor that this weekend is surely going to suck because I won't be able to go anywhere.

      So no update for awhile, sorry.  I've just been doing work, then some more work, and then more.  And I've been going to bed at 10pm (I have NO IDEA why) and waking up at 7, but still really tired.  Ugh.  Anyway, the awards thing is basically completed, and I have it to do tomorrow.  Then its all over!  Yay!  I've been busting my butt on it for the past two weeks, so it'll be nice to see it all unfold.  Other than that, nothing.  Steven is unable to come this weekend...whatever, let's not even go there.  I think Ryan and I are going out Friday, maybe see who else I can dredge up.  Why was I even in that mood Sunday??  Yick.     Current Mood:  Happy, Positive

      Whew, feeling better.  A lot better.  Talked to Jeff some, and he's doing ok in Pittsburgh.  A good, understanding, calming influence on me.  Wish the distance weren't so great at times.  Chatted with Steven, and invited him up Friday to go out.  We'll see, I guess.  Ditto to the distance thing.  Haha  Time to try the reading thing again, or maybe I'll go out for some dinner.

Just give me a time.  And, no, three weeks from now isn't going to cut it.  ;-)  Sunday I drove home to have Easter dinner at my Grandmothers.

      You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.  Dale Carnegie   He who has a thousand friends has not a friend to spare, And he who has one enemy will meet him everywhere.  Ali ibn-Abi-Talib   Most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.  Abraham Lincoln   To be stupid, selfish, and have good health are three requirements for happiness, though if stupidity is lacking, all is lost.   Gustave Flaubert   It is not the critic who counts: not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself for a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat.  Theodore Roosevelt   ...A man who has nothing for which he is willing to fight; nothing he cares more about than he does about his personal safety is a miserable creature who has no chance of being free, unless made and kept so by the exertions of men better than himself.

      Yea, so, I have this theory. The more you discuss something, or feel optimistic about something, the less likely it is to happen. I don't know about anyone else, but this theory applies readily to me. You may note by the post time that I'm not at Mela, and, if you lived down the hall from me, you'd note that I just cooked dinner for myself. Yea. Great.   I'm not mad, just disappointed...although I'm not sure if its more in what I can't control, or myself.   And, so, I stop talking about things.

For the first time, he revealed the title of that briefing: 'Bin Laden Determined To Attack Inside the United States.' Rice insisted this title meant nothing. The document consisted of merely 'historical information' about al-Qaida various plans and attacks of the past. 'This was not a 'threat report,' ' she said. It 'did not warn of any coming attack inside the United States.' Later in the hearing, she restated the point: 'The PDB does not say the United States is going to be attacked. It says Bin Laden would like to attack the United States.'  To call this distinction 'academic' would be an insult to academia."  God damn, stupid people.

      So I'm sitting here at home, waiting for the cable guy to arrive to check out my internet.  Yea, duh, I know its working now, but I'm still having them come check things out, since last time this happened someone had fucked around with the box at the back of the building, but I had canceled and then it died again.  Grrrr.  My new book came, Richard Clarke's "Against All Enemies."  Its a fantastic book and I'm only on Chapter 3.  Even if you don't read the whole thing, everyone in America should read Chapter 1--it is a good recount of what happened at the White House on September 11.  Oh, and I hate Paul Wolfowitz (Deputy Secretary of Defense) even more now.  Last night, I went to Alison's to watch American Idol.  God, how did some of thsoe people get to that point in the competition?  Wow...  E-mail from my parents: father bought a motorcycle.  Just what he needs.  Uhh...I could use the money.  Speaking of which, I'm going extremely cheap now.  No more eating, its just so damn wasteful.  Hahaha.  Work is going ok this week, I actually have to run back to campus by 10am to attend a meeting with Jody and hope the cable man doesn't call then.  Bleh.  I haven't been extremely busy as of late, just keeping the planning for the student life awards on track.  Saturday should be exciting.  Steven is going to try coming to Rochester, and we're going to go see the Mela performance.  Stephen and Laura are both dancing in it, so it should be a good show.  Hehehehe.  I'm more excited to hang out with Steven than see the show, but it'll all be great I'm sure.  Woohoo!  (insert reminder to not get too hopeful here)  Easter is Sunday?  What the hell?  I'm not ready for this.  I haven't bought nearly enough chocolate and other assorted candies.  Weather pending, I may drive home for the day to have dinner with the family.  I feel as though I should participate in something sometime with them.  And what is this I hear/suspect of it being one year for Soules and Haskim?  Hmmm??

I had the absolute best time; it was great meeting him, talking, and seeing Buffalo (yea, I know, that was the scary part.  hehe).  Anyway, I look forward to hanging out more often.

      So, I awaken this morning to a black screen on my computer and "Insert Boot Disk in Drive A:"  What the fuck?  So I restart the computer hoping this smart Windows thing that we all pay our first born child to Bill Gates for would fix itself.  No, it goes to the Windows XP screen and then restarts again on its own.  Constant restarting.  Oh yay.  At this point, you might think this is oh so hilarious, but its not.  Fuck off.  I can't even begin to explain how much this upsets me.  Anyway, after trying various things that should make computers work, I had to format the drive.  Not cool.  Five whole years of work down the tubes.  College papers, PICTURES....umm....PICTURES.  See, this is why I was skeptical of the whole digital camera thing, and why I will always continue to like hard copies of stuff.  I suppose I could pull pictures from the online photo album, but that's not even close to the number I had from various things I've done.  Maybe its a sign to go do all those things again.  Maybe its a sign to forget the past 5 years.  Thankfully I have a decent memory for the things I've done--until that goes.  Yet another thing that makes me just want to move.

      Ok, I'm turning this post into a brief recap of the weekend.  First, Saturday I went to Cory's to helpa gang of us finish up some beer.  We also displayed Sara's graduation present, which is this old sweater one piece skirt thing that Cory owned (but doesn't remember wearing).  Hilarious.  Sunday, I got up, did nothing in particular, went to Bryan's for the unveiling of Sara's graduation present.  Fun times.  Bad cheesesticks (sorry Stephen).  I came home and made some calls to people I hadn't talked to in a while.  Talked to Navin, Ryan, and then Taylor.  All are doing well, I can't wait to visit them all (and I hope I have the chance to)...NYC, Philly, and one of the finger lakes (all of which would make good weekend getaways!).  Anyway, had dinner with Bryan at the Elmwood and we had one of our lovely talks about everything and anything.  Also gave me a chance to pay him back for money I borrowed months ago.  It's now pouring down the rain and lightening.  I opened all the blinds and windows--its just great to sit here and enjoy it.  Ok, enough for now.  Go away.

      Sorry, no title here--couldn't think of one, although I'm sure suggestions will be put in the comments section.  Last night Steven came to Rochester and I gave him a tour of the city and campus, and then we went to the Old Toad for some drinks and chips.  As always, it was nice hanging out and chatting.  I'm definitely all smiles.  Stephen and I have been going to the gym for the past couple days.  I have to keep it up all summer.  If anyone cares to join at 4pm, we meet at the Goergen Center, then go to the fitness center, cardio stuff for 25 mins, then some sort of weights thing.  I know, I'm so techincal with my bodybuilder-speak.  My arms are so painful.  I've been assigned the Urban Fellows crap at work.  I hate it.

      I have a theory.  Actually, I've witnessed it, so I know its fact.  There is a quota of stupid at every university.  So, say, a 65% stupid factor.  There are always 65% of the occupants of that University who are downright stupid.  Complete douches.  During the school year, its not as noticeable, as students are on campus and there's less of an immediate impact to staff members--students are far more likely to be stupid.  (And I'm sorry ladies, but you're far more likely to be stupid.)  But, once summer comes, students leave, but in their wake is leftover stupid on campus, which is then absorbed by staff members who then go to meetings with me and spew stupid everywhere.  Blarrrrrgggggehhhhhhhhh.  Yes, that's the sound of stupid, in case you've never had the pleasure of hearing it spew out of someone's mouth.  Just so you know, it generally happens over the sound of intelligent speak coming from someone else.  Stupid tries to talk at the same time as smart, and stupid always wins because its louder, more obnoxious, and spreads to others in the general vicinity.  Eventually, everyone in the immediate area is spewing stupid--that is how stupid spreads, its airborne.

      So there are absolutely no interesting links in any of my news-reads this morning.  Therefore, you'll have to settle with that is going on this weekend in Rochester, namely  urlLink UofR Commencement  (with  urlLink webcast ) and the  urlLink Lilac Festival .

      I really haven't appreciated the past few weeks from you at all, and I'm still questioning if its even worth bringing up.

      Ok, to avoid having a ton of posts in one day, I'll try to combine the links into one daily post.  Enjoy (except Alison who hates these posts)!  First off, America SUCKS ASS for  urlLink voting off Latoya .  Just think, these are the same people who vote in the November election...wonder who we'll end up with?  Ugh...     urlLink Frank Gehry Gives M.I.T. Its Newest Experiment     urlLink Hello, Pay Phone Information?

      An Apology to the Graduates By Anna Quindlen Newsweek May 17 issue  Members of the class of 2004: I'm so sorry.   I look at all of you and realize that, for many, life has been a relentless treadmill since you entered preschool at the age of 2. Sometimes, as though I am narrating a fairy story, I tell my children of a time when the SAT was taken only once and a tutor was a character in an English novel, when I could manage to pay my own college tuition with summer wages and find both a good job and a decent apartment when I graduated.  Now cottage industries have grown up around the impossibility of any of that: specialized learning centers to supplement schools, special loan programs at usurious rates to supplement college grants, companies that will throw up instant walls to turn a one-bedroom apartment into a place where three people can coexist.  There's an honorable tradition of starving students; it's just that, between the outsourcing of jobs and a boom market in real estate, your generation envisions becoming starving adults. Caught in our peculiar modern nexus of prosperity and insolvency, easy credit and epidemic bankruptcy, you also get toxic messages from the culture about what achievement means. It is no longer enough to make it; you must make it BIG. Television has turned everything into a contest, from courtship to adoption. In a voyeuristic world, fame becomes a ubiquitous career goal.  You all will live longer than any generation in history, yet you were kicked into high gear earlier as well. How exhausted you must be. Your college applications look like the resumes for midlevel executives. We boomer moms and dads had high expectations, ratcheted up by what the more honest of us must admit was something akin to competitive parenting. Soccer leagues. Language programs. Even summer camps that concentrate on college prep instead of sailing.   Your grandparents surely think that it was more stressful to join the service after Pearl Harbor, and at some level they're right. But the mission was clear then, the goal straightforward and honorable, the endgame a good life and a healthy family. What is it now? Public buildings were once named after war heroes, philanthropists and presidents, but in New Jersey one school has managed to keep its gym spiffy by taking money from the local supermarket and putting up a big sign: THE SHOPRITE OF BROOKLAWN CENTER. Cash is the point. Who wants to be a millionaire? Everyone. Although a million doesn't buy what it once did. Just look at the bottom line on your college loans.  Who can blame you if you were not all creating Campus Coalitions for Peace or People for the Ethical Treatment of People? It was not marches or leafleting that drove the political process as you grew up, but soft money and PACs. It now costs so much to run a race for public office that the contribution of any individual may seem puny and irrelevant. Your commencements will take place in the shadow of the revelation that some American troops, styled as heroic liberators, were instead sadistic humiliators in the prisons of Iraq. You new women have a new anti-role model, the G.I. Jane photographed pointing at the genitals of a naked Iraqi and smirking.  One professor at the University of Maryland, who was at the college during the '60s and remembers thousands gathering to protest the Vietnam War, told the Baltimore Sun the activist days are gone forever: "They're interested in their grades and then getting a good job when they get out." It's easy to translate this transformation into vacuous careerism, but it's something more complex than that. Here is a remarkably incisive summation from Lillian Mongeau, who will graduate from Barnard College later this month:  "When telling my family history I proudly tell how each generation sacrificed so that the next could achieve more—more education, more money, more prestige. But how can I achieve more than my parents? They are living the American dream. Now if I don't achieve as much as they did I will have failed, but to achieve more than they did is virtually impossible. To this is the added pressure that there is no excuse for failure. I have had the best of everything ... if I mess up it will be entirely my fault.  "I feel that I just need some time," she adds. "I just want everything to stop moving for a while so that I can think."  To the members of the class of 2004: putting a stop to this treadmill is like disarmament. Who dares to go first? A generation ago your parents, as a group, were known for wanting to give peace a chance in the world. Somehow we have raised a group that wants only a little peace in their own frantic lives. But peace is not what you see in the immediate future, for the world, for this nation or for yourselves. Instead, what stretches before you looks like a version of "Survivor" in street clothes. Find the job. Find the mate. Scale the ladder. Have the baby. Make the deal. Make the birthday cake. The gym, the Gap, the lover, the decor, the cuisine. Who will win the contest? Perhaps it will be those of you brave enough to stop moving.  © 2004 Newsweek, Inc.

       urlLink MSNBC - General says she wasoverruled on prisons : "According to Karpinski's account, the surrender of authority to military intelligence did not go over easily. 'This prison is not mine to give you,' she said she told Miller. He responded, according to Karpinski's account: 'You own the MP's [military police] and you supply them.' Karpinski replied that 'it belongs to the CPA,' or Coalition Provisional Authority. Then, she told investigators, Miller said to her, 'We will do this my way or the hard way,' and asked that the room be cleared so the two were alone. He then said, according to Karpinski's account, 'I have permission to take any facility I want from General Sanchez. We are going to get Military Intelligence procedures in place in that facility because the Military Intelligence isn't getting the information from these detainees that they should. . . . We are going to send MP's in here who know how to handle interrogation.' Miller said through a military spokesman that he never made those comments, but he did not provide his own account of the meeting."

      Last night, Stephen and I had our pizza and beer on his building's rooftop.  Even though it was a little dark (they really should add some lights), it was fun.  Stephen had a group of friend there (who I don't know off hand), and Alison, Meghan, Carolyn, Alex, Sara, Cori, Matt, Ryan, Bryan, Paul, and I'm sure I'm missing people.  Everyone seemed to have a good time--most people said something to that effect.  It's nice having stuff for people, since most of them do stuff in return.  Note I said "most."  I'm trying to listen to it, but I just think it may be too early in the morning to listen to Digitally Imported's Euro Dance station.  I hate perky morning people.  I need coffee.  Coffee Shop is closed.  Damn.  Tonight I guess there's something at the Elmwood.  I'm all over that, and the bartender.  Maybe more later...

We'll call them to the office for a "meeting with the dean," and while they wait you can verbally berate them with the insults of your choice. Classic lines from 2003's successful day include, "Why don't you update the Website, stupid bitch," and "Stop being a homo-hater, homo."  jesmith81:  lmao  jesmith81:  that's so in my profile  Bryan:  yea!

      Commencement webpage is updated, so now it has the correct title.  Finally, only weeks after people requested it.  A victory for the common (and peristant) man against the evil forces at this University that don't do their jobs and/or don't care.  Mwhahaha!  Quote from  urlLink AirAmerica Radio   Unfiltered : "Everyone in America wants a bigger penis and a smaller mortgage."  Yea, that about summarizes all advertising in America.  I must admit that I haven't take much initiative on anything at work.  Our office really needs a week to just rest and regain focus and energy.  Plus, my office is lacking AC, so its like 5 degrees warmer in my area of the office, but now that Gail's fan is here going full blast, its cooling down.  Thrilling, I know you all wanted to hear about it.  Strap yourself in for this one... Tonight Stephen and I are hosting a gathering at the rooftop patio on Stephen's building.  There will be  urlLink Chester Cab  pizza and some beer.  Very casual, relaxed.  Then people can go over to Barfly for the senior night.  Some all UR people who are still around, shoot Stephen or I an e-mail (or call) and let us know you're coming!  I've heard from quite a few of you, and I'm exciting to see those who are coming so far!  Yay!  And some fun quotes because I'm bored at work...  Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could; some blunders and absurdities have crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day; you shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense.  Ralph Waldo Emerson     The real test of friendship is: can you literally do nothing with the other person? Can you enjoy those moments of life that are utterly simple?  Eugene Kennedy     You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.

'She's my toughest one,' he said before bellowing, 'Every Sunday you turn me down!' The woman, Lynn Logan, sat on a shaded bench, nearby, wearing an Ebenezer Scrooge scowl beneath her red-wool hat. 'He oughta get a job. He has nothing better to do,' said Ms. Logan, a retired telephone operator. 'I can't be bothered with this nonsense.'' But asked why she would not relent, she paused and said, 'He's not my type.'"

      So they have redesigned Blogger.com and with that I have redesigned my website.  Now there's this whole comment section, which people can use.  Sadly, the links section is gone.   Today I drove to Fredonia, which is the halfway point between here and Franklin PA.  Met the family there, gave them stuff I didn't need anymore, and had dinner with them.  It was fine, nothing too exciting.  This coming weekend is UR Graduation.  People visiting, and people leaving.  So sad.  Steven may come this Sunday.  I hope so, I'd like him to meet my friends.  Other that that, I don't really have anything to say though, so I'll leave it at that.     Current Mood:  Lonely, but happy/content

      Well it sure has been a while before a post--not even a link (for which Alison likes to complain about).  I apologize for this oversight...actually, no, I don't.  Thursday evening I got a call from Steven, who said his friend Jen's flight was coming into Rochester instead of Buffalo, so he needed directions to our airport.  After watching Will and Grace at Bryan's with Ryan and Sara, I went to the airport and surprised Steven, and I got to meet his sister.  Fun times, and then after an hour of waiting, Jen's flight came in and I got to meet her, and they invited me Pennsylvania the next day because she was going to visit some family friends.  Even though I'm poor, I agreed.  Friday I arrange the day off work, and call Steven, who says they aren't going to PA (they were going Saturday instead), but would be going to Niagara Falls.  So I went there with them.  I had an absolutely fantastic time.  Unbelievable, really.  I took my camera but only ended up taking two pictures, which are in the album.  Basically we walked around the  urlLink American side  (I had never been, and Jen had never been to either side), and then walked to the  urlLink Canadian side .  Jen souvenir shopped, we had lunch at the  urlLink Secret Garden  (cheap, good, strange decor), and walked around some more and then went home.  Someone slap me to get this grin off my face.  Saturday I went with Bryan to  urlLink Cohoe's .  What a fantastic experience that was, then we ate at Atlanta Bread Company, then picked up Sara and Paul and went to visit Cory at the Elmwood.  Mmmmm.  Made plans to go to the drive-in (which were later scrapped because of this damn rain), and then went to Bryan's to watch  urlLink Waiting for Guffman .  What a good movie (duh, because I have it on DVD)!  Then it was off to dinner at Mex with the ladies, and then of Alison's Vocal Point finale with Paul.  The concert was surprisingly good...I mean, not that I didn't expect it to be, a capella just isn't my thing (in fact I hate most of the groups).  Unfortunately, most of the songs were stuck in my head for the rest of the evening--that and the shouting of "gen love buttsex" by Paul.  Classy drunk, real classy.  Anyway, its Sunday, I'm going to clean and not spend much money, and call Alison in like 30 mins to go to Tip Top.  Fun times, fun times.  Mmmm, it sounds so good right about now.

      Well, another weekend of being poor has gone by.  This second job cannot pay me fast enough!  Zach came over this evening and we watched  urlLink Big Fish .  Yup, it's still a good movie.  Lovely story, and I like the images and slight playfulness of the whole thing.  Good times.  Is it sad that the second job sucks so much that it has made my first job look more attractive?  Yes, yes it is.   Each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved. Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion. It merely intensifies it. We can have but one great experience at best, and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible.   Oscar Wilde ,  The Picture of Dorian Gray

      Oh Alison, with the line "I'm leaving this place" (as well as variations on it), you basically summarized my evening (and your moving out of your house).  Last night I hanged out with Alison and Zach.  We enjoyed some coffee (or iced drinks that people complain about constantly) at  urlLink Spin , and just talked, and of course laughed until it hurt.  Ow.  Then back to Zach's for a bit, where I enjoyed a late dinner of Twizzlers.  Mmmmm, went well with the applesauce I had before that.  At this rate, I'm bound to lose another 20lbs.  Yay!  Then, due to the intensity of...I dunno...we went over to Alison's.  She's moving.  Correction, she's paying people to move her.  Whew.  I think having a little more money would have assisted the "doing something" yesterday evening, but it was all good.  Good times, good people.  Mint is pain, by the way.  And giving birth gives you an orgasm.  I know!  Random lesser known facts that are just ripe for conversational and comical opportunities.  Well, with the three of us they are.  Today is going to be a pretty blah day.  Probably just clean the place a bit, maybe find something to do with someone out in the real world.  Or just read.  I dunno, its all up in the air now.  I have an urge to go to Target, but no money.  Boo-hoo.   Current Music:  Boogie Pimps - "Sunny"

      Today was the first full day of work at the  urlLink Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra  calling center.  It was ok, nothing thrilling.  No sales, but probably 6 leads, 2 of which may pan out to something.  The one old lady I called could not hear a thing.  I was speaking... one... word... at... a... time... loudly... to... accommodate... her... lack... of... hearing.  At one point she thought I was calling about carpets.  "Yes, carpets, I want to know about your carpets."  "Ok, what about them?"  "No, CONCERTS, ma'am, CONCERTS."  Yah, you know, that carpet fetish I have.  haha, crazy old bag.  Wow.  Anyway, I ended up just telling her thanks for her time, hanged up, and made a note to remove her from the list.  She's obviously  never  going to hear a concert.  Last night I went to see  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  with Zach.  Absolutely fantastic movie, with good company--a great evening all around.  Ended up yakking with Zach until about 2:30am, over tofu dogs (mmm mmm mmm!).  Lovely evening.  Then slept, went to work, now home hoping something to do will come up for this evening.  Note: I'm so freakin' poor.

      Finally!  It's actually Friday!  Yesterday I got up thinking it was Friday, then suddenly realized it was Thursday and that was...depressing, to say the least.  But today...Friday...yay!!  Sort of wished I had plans for the evening, but I don't.  Maybe something will come up.  Fahrenheit 9/11 is probably all sold out at The Little at this point.  blah  Work has been moderately productive, as I've finished setting up everyone's computers, and upgrading software.  Just one more to do...  Meeting Dan at Noon for lunch.  Haven't seen him for a while, so it will be nice to chat some.  Whoa, next weekend is the 4th of July.  I really need to make sure that everyone is set to do stuff.  Free concert, fireworks on the roof, Ryan will be back in town on July 2-5, then Mindy comes into town the week of the 5th.  Yay!!  And thanks, it means a lot to me that we can both get along and be happy.  :-)

        loy·al·ty   NOUN: Inflected forms: pl. loy·al·ties 1. The state or quality of being loyal. See synonyms at fidelity. 2. A feeling or attitude of devoted attachment and affection. Often used in the plural:  My loyalties lie with my family.       fi·del·i·ty   NOUN: Inflected forms: pl. fi·del·i·ties 1. Faithfulness to obligations, duties, or observances. 2. Exact correspondence with fact or with a given quality, condition, or event; accuracy. 3. The degree to which an electronic system accurately reproduces the sound or image of its input signal.   SYNONYMS:  fidelity, allegiance, fealty, loyalty  These nouns denote faithfulness.  Fidelity  implies the unfailing fulfillment of one's duties and obligations and strict adherence to vows or promises: fidelity to one's spouse.  Allegiance  is faithfulness considered as a duty:  “I know no South, no North, no East, no West, to which I owe any allegiance…. The Union, Sir, is my country” (Henry Clay) .  Fealty , once applied to the obligation of a tenant or vassal to a feudal lord, now suggests faithfulness that one has pledged to uphold:  swore fealty to the laws of that country .  Loyalty  implies a steadfast and devoted attachment that is not easily turned aside:  loyalty to an oath; loyalty to one's family .  Why are these items more present in some?  What makes us identify with a particular set of beliefs, or a particular moral and ethical matrix?  How are our expectations of others formed?  Disclaimer: I'm not writing to point anything out in anyone that I know, have known, or possibly will know.  It's just a weird discussions/meeting at work that got the gears rolling on issues like this--I supposed they can be summarized as childhood/teenager development issues.  I tend to be quite loyal to people, ideas, laws, and ethics.  The question is though, what shapes this: how does it develop: what events/experiences contribute to it?  I don't know, just pointless rambling on my part.  You know...this was probably all covered in that college class "Introduction to Ethics" that I was terribly bored in, didn't go to, and withdrew from in week 13 because of a D.

      Talked to Kevin tonight.  It was ok, probably would have been slightly easier in person--I seem to have a better time finding words then.  Overall it was fine; hopefully that'll be that.  I mean, it was ok for me, and hopefully I didn't completely ruin stuff by talking.  I know how much it irks him, but then again it'd irk me too.  I just  had  to talk, and it was a good thing because it put my mind at ease.  I now understand a lot more about myself.  There was one part that helped me tremendously--it just put everything in perspective--just to be ourselves.  People should be able to get along with one another because they are being themselves and like one another for who they are, not some modified version of themselves.  Just be myself--it's fairly easy and straightforward.  From now on things will be different.  I'm done worrying about this.  I can do this (because I've obviously done it before!)--just be myself and not get bent out of shape about everything.  Hopefully I didn't permanently ruin a friendship in the mess up to now.

      Today at work, our new computers came in.  How exciting!  A nice new 17" flatscreen monitor works so much better on my desk, and is incredibly easy on my eyes.  Yay!  And my whole area is nice and clean--smells hospitalish.  Ohh, a new word.  The weekend was very low-key.  I was hoping to hang out with some people, but that didn't work out.  Who knows whenever stuff like that will, but I'll wait patiently from now on, give it a bit and then be concerned.  Right now, my trust is placed in them, and I hope they don't break it (especially since that's the root of my concern--that its going to be broken, and me forgotten!).  Enh...  Sunday morning (and by that I mean Midnight to 4am), I went with Stephen to visit Zach's new apartment.  I'm in love with that location, I wish I would have looked into those places a little more.  And Zach's a fun guy to hang out with, so hopefully there will be more of that.  Oh, and Stephen's fun too, but we all knew that already.  Sunday I went to see  urlLink Super Size Me  at The Little.  Interesting film, although it tried a couple of times to be far more dramatic than it needed to be.  It was good to get that information and statistics though.  Not that I ate a lot of fast food before, but I certainly won't be eating it unless its not an option.  I also should cut down on my diet pop intake.  But Diet Coke is the nectar of the Gods, so its hard to pass up.   Current Music:  Coldplay, "God Put a Smile Upon Your Face".  Now that "Break My Stride" is out of my head!  Whew!

      I feel pretty good about how things are going, I hope others do too.  A few bugs here and there, but...  Be courteous to all, but intimate with few, and let those few be well tried before you give them your confidence. True friendship is a plant of slow growth, and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity before it is entitled to the appellation.  George Washington   Yah, that's about right...good ol' George.  I agree, nothing to worry about too much, just have to try to be fair, polite, open, honest, and respectful.  Overall, I'm content with where I am at with all this.  It makes me happy.  Hmm, so today.  Yea.  I went at 2pm to fill out an application and interview for a part-time job doing telemarketing for the  urlLink Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra .  The lady failed to show at 2.  I left, somewhat disgruntled but understanding, at about 2:25pm.  I had sat there for about 45 mins, since I was there before 2pm (as I'm sure everyone knows, I'm usually early for everything and have to make an effort to be on time, as in at that actual time, rather than way early).  She called back tonight at 4:40pm and I went there to interview.  It went fine, she said she would give a call back on Saturday.  Hopefully I'll get something there, as I need the job, plus its for a good organization, and I'd learn more about the RPO.  So, everyone pray for me...  Tomorrow is the East End Fest, and I'm hoping Kevin and possibly some of his friends will come down for that.  Stephen is bartending at Alexandria's, so I won't really have anyone to go with otherwise.  It's not too terribly expensive, and its something to do.  Today at work I wrote up a (joking) disciplinary letter for my boss, since yeterday he put a dent in the wall from swinging open the door and the knob hitting.  He wrote back about how the process from "fascist" and "unfair."  Hilarious.  Good times, I'm enjoying this job, although I wish it paid a lot more.  Moving to a new job would be nice because of the money, but losing the flexibility will be a pain.  Ok, this post is long enough...give me a call if you want me to gab more.  hehehe

Anyway, she just called and said people at work were making fun of her because she just found out today that President Reagan had died. I guess she doesn't listen to the radio either.  She says all she does is file all day at work, and then play Playstation games at night, and that Lara Croft didn't tell he about the dead pres. (And she is a communications major).

      Ronald Reagan has finally passed.  Ok, I didn't mean that to sound rude.  The whole thing reminds me of my grandfather, so its slightly upsetting.  I know what the Reagans are going through--its difficult.  There are numerous things on the web and on TV about it, so I'll spare the links.  I would like to point out one thing--listen to the clips of Reagan speaking on TV while he was president.  How freakin' calming is he?!  No one since has spoken so eloquently...I mean, for a man to get so many Democrats to cross over like he did, and to win every single state but one in 1984 is amazing.  "The Great Communicator" indeed.  (Republicans: Do not take this as an endorsement in any way of trickle-down economics, or of naming every building the federal government has after Reagan)

      All of my friends have recently been sick.  Stephen was out with a "body ache" the other day.  Not sure exactly what that entails, nor do I want to really know.  I think its his body in shock from actually working and moving about in the world.  hehe.  Last night, Zach, Alison, and I went to see Napoleon Dynamite, and afterwards Zach and I got him some sushi and then went to Spot.  Something he ate resulted in an allergic reaction overnight with hives and swollen throat.  Yikes.  Then there is me.  I went to work, feeling fine and wanting a productive day.  I get there, then my vision gets blurry and there's its really bright, so it made looking at my monitor nearly impossible.  Then, slowly, my head started to hurt.  Oh yes, migraine.  So I took some advils, then went to get something to eat.  Well, the food looked good, but it all had no taste whatsoever.  Then as I was sitting in our 68F office, my body became unable to regulate its body temperature, and I felt really really really warm.  Then the stomach was slightly upset.  I decided at this point that I should go home, and said goodbye to everyone and IMs, etc.  I then realized on my walk to the car that I should call someone and ask for a ride because I felt like I was going to pass out.  But...EVERYONE I know is sick.  Damn you, God.  Damn you.  Clearly no one could pick me up, and I thought of calling Kevin, but then I didn't want to make him ill.  I decided I'd drive home at 40mph, and did.  Got home, vomited twice, called my mother to whine, had some diet coke, cold washcloth over my eyes, and finally fell asleep for two hours.  I would not have wished this pain on my evilest of enemies.  I'm in bed, moaning in pain, and hoping that I'd see a tunnel and a light because at that point, I'd have gone.  Yah.  That bad.  Not even the cute dog card from the last time I was this sick that is on the bulletin board in my kitchen could make me feel better.  Well, ok, it helped a little.  Now I'm somewhat recovered.  Still a little light-headed, but doing ok.  Stephen is feeling slightly better at this point too, and is on his way over to order food and watch movies.  Sister and her friends arrive tomorrow.  Moving on Sunday.  Lastly, I won't have cable TV or RoadRunner until AUGUST 13.  I know!  Why is it going to take that long to transfer?  What the hell!  So, if you want to hang out, you definitely need to call my cell for two weeks.

      Ok, well there were some ladies there (Laura, Amy, and Lindsay) in addition to Kevin, myself, Stephen, and Zach.  Fun times!  Started off at Laura's where there was a little beer pong action.  I can't really remember who won what there, so I'll just say Kevin and I beat the other teams.  Hey, its my journal, and if I wanna win here, I will!  At RJs, there was much drinking, pool, and singing.  I know Kevin and I lost at least once, but that was the game that didn't matter, and again, its my journal, so we reign supreme over all others.  Actually, I get better the more I drink (to a limit obviously) at beer pong, and worse at pool.  Good times.  I'm thinking that I might need a break next week though, or soon.  As usual, I'll just see how things go.  I had an extremely good time, and I'm thankfully every day that things are going well.  Getting to work was a little bit of a task this morning.  I wish I could sleep in like...well,  everyone else  who goes out with me.  At least I called off work at the RPO tonight.  I just need to go home and sleep.  Maybe I'll permanently change my Wednesday night to a Thursday night there.  Haha, all in the name of fun.  I can't wait to move!  I know I say this in like every other post, but honestly, the new place is going to be so much better, and cheaper for me.  I have to start thinking about housewarming party plans...I'm thinking mid-August sometime, and its going to be very college-themed.  Think beer pong and lots of booze.  And Zach claims to make a mean margarita.  There, you happy?  I've called it "beer pong" throughout.  :-P

      Friday was the day to drive home.  I left Rochester at 8am and arrived, as scheduled, at 11:30am in Franklin.  Yeehaw.  Got the car inspected and got subs from Leonardo's (sooooo good!).  As my mother and I were doing these errands, she was pointing out people walking downtown who she thought needed " urlLink Ambush Makeovers ."  We then agreed that it was most of the town that needed them.  Then it was home to change the oil, and then I washed the car, vacuumed the car, washed the floor mats, and did some laundry.  Exciting.  I also had the chance to see both of my grandmothers.  One twisted her back and "is in so much pain she rather not live."  (I rolled my eyes when she said that).  The other grandmother is doing well, she was outside burning papers, and a stump, when we got there.  We went out back, and the "stump" was actually a whole tree that had fallen down years ago and she's slowly burning it.  My mother expects her to have completed her task in another decade.  Oh, and the grandmother also had to dispose of paint, so she put that on the fire too.  Such an environmentalist!  Anyway, left home at 4pm and returned to Rochester at 7:30pm.  Yay!  Last night I went out to fish fry dinner (with money from the grandmothers, yay!) with Alison, Stephanie, Zach, and Stephen.  Fun times, afterwards we went back to Stephen's to hang out.  Nothing too exciting.  Chilly night.  Work today was good, I got two sales, and Beth gave me the commission from her sale.  Yay!  Money!  And I finally found someone who could go to the RPO summer concert I had a ticket for, so Stephen will be joining me.  That's at 7:30, so until then I shall rest, wash my new shirt, and waterproof my new shoes.  Yay.

      First off, the Stephen's cats now have names: Colby and Jack.  The suggestion was Kevin's, so congratulations to him.  I was hoping for the suggestion "Siegfried and Roy," but the cheese reference works best because the cats are orange, and they taste good.  Oh?  Did I just say that?  Tuesday evening at the RPO was a bit strange.  Not really for me (it was just dull for me), but for Zach.  Some guy hit on him over the phone.  Weird.  He was like, "Will you attend the concerts with me?" and saying he liked Zach's name and laugh, and ending the call by calling him "love."  Creeeeeepy, but oh-so-funny.  Definitely a qualified call back, which will hopefully lead to a sale (of tickets, not body).  I'm eating a bagel now at work.  I really wish I had an orange juice.  Mmmm.  After the RPO, Stephen, Zach, and I went out for the evening.  First it was to Laura's for some beer pong (beirut, whatever) with various people.  Please note that Zima XXX Cherry stuff isn't that great.  Drinks like that irk my stomach.  Then the whole pack of us went to RJ's (yes, I still refuse to call it by its other name).  Kevin and I played some pool against Rob and his friend Ryan, and we won the first game (read: We got lucky when they missed a shot).  The second game Rob and Ryan won, but it was close (not really), and I think the alcohol intake was having an adverse effect on our team (again, not really, we handle our drinks quite well).  Anyway, we crapped out before the third game, but I've been told that we owe them a deciding match.  The rest of the evening there was spent chatting, drinking, and watching Stephen and Laura sing Sonny and Cher's "I Got You Babe."    Ewww, and some guy hit on me outside while I was getting some fresh air and asked if I wanted to spend an evening with him.  Ummm...no thanks, Mr. Crack-Addict.  Then he asked for some money to get back to Buffalo, so I gave him $2 and then prayed to God that someone would come outside and save me.  He asked if I had any spare change, but I said no, as quarters are like gold (laundry, pool, darts).  Yah, apparently my time outside matched up with no one's smoke break, as NO ONE else was out there, except for some lesbians making out approximately  40 feet to my right.  Oh, and a midget...err...smaller lesbian who was outside smoking, but I didn't put much faith in her ability to stop Mr. Crack-Addict.    Anyway, fun times with all; it's probably the best night out I've had in a very very long time.  :-)  Thursday evening is Margaret Cho still, and Friday off to home and back the same day for car stuff.  No real plans for the weekend, so get in touch with me.  Next weekend my sister is coming to visit with a couple friends to see a concert, and I'll be moving sometime around then.  And then mid-August it'll be housewarming party time!  Yay!

      Well, the weekend fun started out with a late lunch on Friday with Kevin, Alison, and Kat. Fun times, and its nice to hang out with Kevin every now and then, even if its only a quick lunch. I had the late lunch because I had to stay until 4pm at work in case a student came in. None did. Then it was off to work at the RPO from 5-9, to make-up for not being there on Saturday.  Nothing super-exciting at work, and I spent my evening doing nothing.  Saturday, a pack of us headed to Stephen's home downstate, between Albany and NYC. He has a big ol' farm with like 25 horses or something, plus a various assortment of (how to say this nicely?) rural people. Crazy. It was Laura, Patty, Alison, myself coming from Rochester, and Matt coming from Boston. Fun times...I think Laura's away message summarizes most of the weekend:    once upon a time I went to a horse farm in downstate new york. the path was lit by the holy light of the bisexual. there were many people there, but not enough that wanted to go to pleasure island. we celebrated 2 graduations and 1 birthday. cassie and mike chased each other around the yard. keith spilled my wine. steve almost bulldozed us all over. matt threw me in the pool. alison sang kissing you like a pro. I slept in daria's bed with her pants and jason. fran made the best potato salad I've ever eaten. ryan blew out all his candles. patty changed her outfit 5 times. daniel flirted with all the ladies. anna said just close your eyes and fantasize. and stephen left with two kittens. holla!  There are also pics in the  urlLink photo album . I only put a few up there, as I don't want to overflow my picturetrail account with one event. Speaking of which, anyone know of any good, free picture websites where you can link directly to photos and albums, etc?   urlLink      Stephen brought home two kittens with him.  Yay!  We returned at 6pm on Sunday to Rochester, and then I went to see "I, Robot" with Brian G.  It was a pretty good movie, not sure it was worth $8 though.  More like a matinee-price movie.  I believe that about covers the weekend crap.  This week will prove fairly uneventful.  No major plans except Thursday I'm going to see the new  urlLink Margaret Cho  movie with Brian H., Mark, and Rich.  Friday I'm driving home for the day to get the car inspected, but will be back Friday at like 6 (I hope).  Oh, and while setting up this webserver thing on my computer, I checked the log for my Remote Desktop software.  You wouldn't believe the amount of bad password attempts there were from IPs that I have no idea about.  I mean, they're easy enough to trace (stupid people), but instead I'll just retrict things more so that its only my work computer that can log onto home.  Stupid people.

      Nothing new really, which is actually good because I think I have a decent balance to my life at the moment. Whew. I went to see Anchorman with Carolyn, Stephen, and Alison last night. A very good stupid-funny movie. I'm sorry I ever doubted it.   Enjoying dinner tonight with Laura, and then a graduation party for Stephen on Saturday, but otherwise no plans. I'm not working tonight (whew! a break!), but going in on Friday (5pm to 9pm, as always). Again, if anyone every wants to do anything shortly after 9, I'm usually free. I work between Java's and Spot, so those are usually good options, or a movie at The Little. Anything really, I just hate calling people so late because most people have plans by then, so call my cell phone, leave a message and I can check it on my break (around 7 or 7:30) and get back to you right then, or right at 9. Yay!   In all due respect to Kevin's news headlines today, especially the defeat of the gay marriage ban amendment (ugh, just mentioning it makes my blood boil, and makes me want to shake babies), I'd also like to point out  urlLink The Daily Show  website, which has been quite funny lately. Especially  urlLink Rob Corddry's Vice Presidential Analysis . Sadly, I'd still vote for the kitten. Oh, and you'll need RealPlayer to watch their videos, but trust me, its worth it.   Also from the Comedy Central websites, enter to win the  urlLink Indecision 2004 sweepstakes , and if you win, take me with you.   And a great find on Kevin's part:  urlLink Glassdog.com .

      Yah, ok, so it seems most people that I hang with are going to go to RJs anyway.  I wish I could go, I really wish I could.  It's really upsetting me that I can't control that part of me, and while it would be most fantastic to hang out with my friends, I can't risk this other friendship that is going decently well.  I really can't.  As stupid and overdramatic as this all sounds, it's simply something too good to risk.  I need to go to sleep before this gets to me even more.  :-/ maybe after a good night's sleep I'll consider it

      An update from the land of work.  Today was "cleaning day," and we have spend the whole morning cleaning out our storage closet and now everyone is working on their respective offices.  As my office is the lobby, its fairly clean at the moment, so no work for me.  Although, I am defrosting the office refrigerator that hasn't been defrosted in the 4 years that this office has been here.  It is going to take another day for the two inch thick ice in the freezer portion to thaw.  Yick.  And it smells.  So I have no idea what to do with this upcoming week.  I do know that I want to get Indian food some evening, and enjoy it on the roof.  I'm unsure about RJs on Tuesday; I think I'll pass on that for a while (sorry ladies, but there's just stuff there that triggers horrible anxiety, and since I feel as though I'm finally in a decent place with some people, I rather keep it that way and on good terms).  Maybe I'll see what those fine RJ ladies are up to another evening and see them, do something.  Maybe catch up with Kat some evening and see how she is doing--left her a message the other day.  I suppose I could arrange to go see Steven in Buffalo sometime.  Maybe Kevin will be around some evening too, not that I expect to hang out with him, but I wouldn't be opposed to the idea of something.  Ugh, I hate this work schedule until 9pm.  If people want to do things they really need to call me and leave a message on my phone and I'll gladly meet them after 9 when I leave work.  This weekend is Stephen's graduation party at his farm.  So, fun times on Saturday, back in town on Sunday.  Ok, I'm just rambling on about possibilities for this week...  Onto possibilities for this summer, as it is winding up quickly.  Now that I will have more money since I'm moving, and having the second job, I'll get to go visit people.  I'm hoping to get to Montreal some weekend, and maybe DC later in the fall.  I also have to go visit Ryan in Philadelphia sometime relatively soon.  Navin will be in town, and then in Toronto, the last full week in August, so I'll take a day off then and take the ferry to Toronto for the day.  I'll have to find some folks to go along.  I'd like to also make it to more concerts this summer, but finances have prevented me from even looking at schedules.  Enh, maybe something will come up.  Yah, more money means I'm game for many more things, so come up with things people!   Current Music:  Franz Ferdinand - Take Me Out (and the rest of the album)

      Finally mellowing out from all that anxiety.  Yiiiiiiiick.  I hate those uncontrollable anxious moments that flare up for no reason, or really stupid reasons.  It's so hard to explain to some people, without them thinking your some sort of dysfunctional loser with some mental and emotional defect.  You get stuck in a cycle of wanting them to understand and show some compassion, but not come off as some maniac.  So yea people, show some compassion, and don't worry about that other crap, I assure you I'm not a maniac.  lol.  And to those of you who do already, thanks, and I apolgize that it sometimes throws me off guard, I'm just not used to people actually caring and saying so outwardly.  But that's nice, and much more healthy for all involved.  Soon enough someone will come along, Jason, soon enough.  Something I forgot to mention in the last few depressing posts that  urlLink Flint  will be living with me come Aug 1.  Yay!!  I can't wait to move...down one floor.

      Me, Ryan, Laura, Amy, Allison, Kat, Genevieve, Peter, Ester, Rob, Rick, Lisa, Sara, Cori, Alex, Elizabeth, Brian G., Stephen, Alison, Anthony, Kim, Samantha, Patty, Tom, Brian H., Mark  26 people  That definitely exceeds the limit on the number of people that can fit in my tiny studio.  But it was definitely fun times with everyone.  BBQ at Stephen's, drinking, going to the roof to watch fireworks and get all wet, then playing Catch Phrase.  Fun times with a really great group of people.  Allison and I share a deep appreciation for the tater tot (crispy on the outside, soft in the middle!).  Again, I wish some others were there for the fun.  Some Catch Phrase quotes of the night: (Answers could be "Stephen") "It's something you do when you're really drunk..." "Don't go home with..." (Strangers) "Not a top but a..." (Bottom)  There was also some other quote Alison said (of course), but I can't remember it at this point.  It was during Stephen's BBQ, and I told her that there was no way she was going to top that comment and she might as well stop talking.  If you remember it dear, put it in the comments.  hehehe  I can't wait to move to the two-bedroom place and have everyone over for a housewarming party.  Now that'll be fun, and I can actually fit this many people in my apartment!  It's so nice to see Laura and Amy together, as well as Allison and Kat.  Happy people make for good times.  Oh, and Brian and Mark, too.  That one makes me especially happy to see.  And it was the first time seeing Anthony since he: 1. Got Married and 2. Moved back to Rochester.  It was nice, hopefully I'll get to see them more in a non-party type atmosphere as that would allow for more catching up.  It was the first time hanging out with a couple people, like Rob and his friends Rick and Lisa.  Lisa was quite the drunken character towards the end of the evening, having quite the discussion of her "wild monkey sex" with Rick.  Yikes, there were definitely details that scarred me for life.  RJ's on Tuesday.  Yay!  Garbage plates afterwards?  Tater tots?  hmm...  Mindy arrives with....Tom (?), her boyfriend, today.  She'll be visiting all week and they are staying with Bryan.  It'll be nice to see her and hang out with her.  I'm taking Thursday off work in order to do something for the majority of the day.  Showing the two-bedroom place to Flint at 4pm.  Hopefully that'll work out.  Spiderman with Brian G. and whoever wants to join.  Ugh, I really don't want to work today at the RPO 5-9.

      Ryan is in town this weekend, and is staying at Chateau Smitty with its lovely couch accomodations.  Friday he dined with some friends, and then Alison, he, and I watched   urlLink EuroTrip   at my place.  I love that movie, so funny.  Saturday was the free concerts in Buffalo.  Ben Folds, Rufus Wainwright, and Guster were playing, plus a couple warm-up groups (Avion?  and some horrid female group).  It was a good time overall.  Myself, Brian G., Ryan, Laura, Amy, Peter, Esther, Kat, Sara, Alissa (?), Kara (?), Alex, and Elizabeth.  I need to remember names better, but I think I got them all.  Kevin and Allison were also there with their friends, and as always it was nice to see them.  Fun people, fun times, crazy lesbians.  Just wish some others could have been there.  Steven and I talked like 6 times yesterday, which was strange.  Well, what's strange is talking, then not talking for a month, then talking a lot.  Hmm.  Dunno where all that is presently, but then again I have no idea where anything is with anyone in that field.  Enh, at this point they can come to me.  So today is Sunday, the actual birthday of our most beloved country.  I don't really have anything planned other than Stephen's BBQ and then people are coming to my place anytime after 8.  It's turning out to be a decent day, hopefully the fireworks will go well weather-wise.  Well, hopefully no one will get injured either, but I don't think that's an immediate concern for me or anyone I know.  Keep it safe guys.

      Work is boring me.  Actually, there are things I could be doing, but I much rather be home getting the apartment in order.  It's going to be a fairly uneventful end of the week and beginning of the weekend.  Sara and Cori are leaving for law school, so I suppose I'll see them sometime in the next couple of evenings.  Stephen returns this evening from seeing Matt in Boston, before Matt leaves for Russia (teaching English for at least one year, maybe more).  Kevin is traveling to Philly with Kat and Allison to camp and see the Warped Tour.  Fun times for them, and they return sometime on Saturday.  I need to make my way to Philly soon to see Ryan--I'm hoping for the beginning or mid September.  Navin comes August 20 and stays with me that weekend, then is taking the  urlLink ferry  to Toronto to get his work visa approved or something for the following week, staying with relatives.  I think I'm going to take one or two of those days off work and take the ferry to Toronto, and its made all the better because now the ferry is  urlLink 50% off for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday travel in August .  Maybe take the money I save and get a hotel room so I can spend the night and go out on the town there, since I've never been.  Hmmm...anyone care to join?   urlLink Park Ave Fest  is this weekend, so I'll probably have a small gathering of folks to go to that and maybe dinner at the new apartment.  Maybe a Sunday brunch.  Mmm...brunch.  Yah, its lunch time and I haven't eaten yet.   Current Mood:  Indifferent / A fine balance has been found  Current Music:  "Tell Her Tonight," by Franz Ferdinand

      The apartment is slowly getting organized.  My room is all painted, as is the other bedroom.  So they still have to do the kitchen, living room, and bathroom.  I have no idea where the guy is right now, he was supposed to come back this afternoon and paint the rest.  I took the day off work so I could arrange things, and I even started to hang some pictures up in my bedroom.  Yippie!  Last night, we went out to RJs.  It was Zach, Lindsay, Jess, Kevin, and I.  Good times, although I really think I need a break soon from it.  Yah, totally not my intention to do any harm--do I ever feel like a jerk.  Other than that, things are going a-ok.  The next few days I'll be trying to arrange the apartment more, and figuring out what furniture I want brought up from home, and what stuff needs to leave.

      Sunday I moved into my new apartment, with help from my sister and her two friends, and Stephen.  Unfortunately, because the people before me were not out until Saturday, they couldn't get anyone in this place to paint and clean.  It was a dump, and still needs cleaned better.  The landlord just called and is going to have someone over here tomorrow to clean.  The maintenance guy stopped by to, and will begin painting tomorrow.  Today they'll replace lightbulbs (the people before must have lived in the dark), and do a little prep work.  All in all, its going to be a nice place once its organized.  I took today off work so that I could organize and unpacked, but because of all the work and cleaning they have to do, I can't do much.  They should be done by the weekend though.  I guess I'll just sit around.  Blah.  I wish I had something to write about, but I don't.  I'm beginning to miss a relationship, so maybe something will need to be done on that front.  After I'm settled into the new place.   Current Music:  "Float On," Modest Mouse
