      No one knows no one cares, Everyone is spliting hairs, We all run, jump, swim and play, But in the end we all die anyway.

      Why do I try when all I do is fail? Why do I hurt when all I need is love? What should I do when I have no will? Why should I try when there is no strength? What's to do when I know not what to do? Where should I turn what should i do? Is there anything I can do? Were I to know what it is will I be able to do it? Do I have the strength to continue? If I continue is it worth it? Where is the path that i lost so long ago? These things and more are the questions in my life.

      We all do things in this life that we don't always want to do, but they have to be done anyway.  I did something today that hurt two really good friends of mine. i'm not proud of what i did. i did it because i was left with no options. i suppose i should start at the begining. about 15 months ago i met this really great woman. we clicked real well but we knew we couldn't have a relationship at the time. i mean i was married and she had a boy friend. its come down the road to become a great friendship. Well i ended up in the proccess of a divorce in june and me and the ex-wife descided we were just gonna go on with life as if the papers were final (can't afford the $$ to pay the court costs) well she still had a BF so i let that stand where it was, but i ended up meeting her best friend and getting in a "relationship" with her. and by relationship i mean friends with benifits. well it ended up that me and this girl i've known for 15 months ended up spending four days out of state together, and "got together" ok no biggy just a bit of fun on the side. well it ends up that she gets rid of her BF. well her BF has made her promise that she wont follow up any feelings she has had for me. so i been trying to figure out a way to fix this whole mess i been in for the last two months. i finally descided tonight that i can't fix it so im just gonna walk away. and tonight i told them both that i was essencially going to have nothing to do with either of them on a more than professional level(I.E. the fact that im a mechanic) so im feelin a bit down today. but i hope i made a few of y'all feel a little better about your life after reading this.
