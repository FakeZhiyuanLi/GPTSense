      So I guess it's been a couple days since I wrote....If fact, I havent done much of anything in the last couple of days.  This morning I have to go to my high school's graduation ceremony to seat ppl and hand out diplomas.....should be fun.  And I have a really strong feeling that I have something to do this afternoon but I can't think of what it might be.  This is really bothering me...  Tomorrow after work I have two different parties..........I think..because I havent heard anything about one of them since it was meantioned.  Then on Monday, my bestest best friend....you know, my other half...is braiding my hair.  Of course, it won't look quite so good as that picture, because I'm just doing it with my hair, rather than use extensions.  Maybe in the future......like after I get back from Germany.  And speaking of, things are beginning to get hectic.  A friend, who is also going, and I have been playing e-mail tag (because I don't use the phone unless its really necessary) tryin to get together to play some tennis and discuss packing, because we'll be rooming together, and we don't want 2 or 3 of things that can be shared.  After all, we only get one suitcase and one carry-on, with a weight limit of 44 lbs.  (Which I think is rather a random number to regulate.)  I have a quote on that:  "Government's view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it." - Ronald Wilson Reagan  Maybe I'll use this afternoon to talk to a friend of mine about a software program and the music he said he would give me (so that I have all the greatest music on this flight to Germany and can therefore ignore the ppl that I don't like that are going on this trip).  We are also packing cards and, specifically, Uno cards....gotta be the koolest card game (well, except for carp..........maybe I can teach that to ppl on the trip, cuz they never wanted to learn it before).  And that's about all I've got for now.......    Favorite music of the moment:  Ashlee Simpson's "Pieces of Me", Avril Lavigne's "My Happy Ending"

      Or at least this day.  Just got back from Applebee's, which we always go to after Youth Group...........I'm so upset, cuz I'm gonna miss this year's video scavanger hunt(which is supposed to be mad fun).  My summer is gonna be mad crazy though.........the day after I get back from Germany, I go with my family, some extended family, and my other half (I would say better half, but since we are the same person, that would not work) to the area's Six Flags, which is Darien Lake.  Then, a week after I get back from that, I go to the same park for Kingdom Bound!...............Two or three weeks after that, college classes start, then high school begins about a week into Sept.  So it was no job for me this summer.......which means lack of funds....oh well, this is the time of my life, right?  over and out

      Ah, another day, another journal.........  I have one on LiveJournal, so I don't know why I've created this one.  I just got done with the first half of my ELA, so now I only have two more days of testing to go:  part 2 of the ELA is tomorrow, and the Chem is next week.  Then I'm done.....and a SENIOR!  Yeah, Ok, so it's not so exciting to be saying that anymore.  My schedule next year is basically college:  AP Chemistry, University Calc, (Gym, my only high school level class), then I go to the college to take ENG Comp 101 and American Politics....so thats actually 13 credits the first semester alone.  That ought to cut down on full time college costs in the future, right?  Tonight I'm going out to get pizza with my AP US History class.......on our teacher's bill, so all is good!  This should be interesting....there are a lot of strange people in my class.......  Ok, so some interesting sites:  www.fictionpress.com  (I'm on there, just search wildasthewolves, though I haven't published anything on it in a while and the stuff up is crap that was archived on my computer that has to be reworked)  www.qotd.org  Quotes.....emailed for free every morning  www.takingitglobal.com  awesome site for the activist within (if you can find him)  So that's all I can think of right now.............buh-bye!

      Finally, my family is away for another of my brother's baseball tournaments...the last of the summer, I think. Unfortunately.  See, this is a good thing, because it means I get the truck to myself for four days...not to mention no one is nagging me, so I do things like chores more quickly...the 'rents really need to figure out that telling me to do something just makes me not want to do it. You know what I mean? Don't ask me why it works that way...I have no idea myself why I have that reaction to my 'rents requests.  basically the only other thing I've been doing it my college search. I want to go to school for creative writing...and you would think that would be an easy one to figure out, seeing as how most colleges have an English programs. Well, see, that is the problem. The majority of schools have an English program, but it is almost always literature, not writing. So the first step was to find schools whose English Department either offered a concentration within the English major for creative writing, or who offered a completely separate Creative Writing major. From there I got rid of any schools that were too far away, seemed to have too weak a writing program, or just didn't seem to fit what I wanted. That actually narrowed the field considerably, because I also want to go to a school that has extensive opportunities for studying foreign languages and culture, has a widespread Study Abroad program, and offers the right business courses.  The reason for these somewhat unrelated desires is this: I plan, not to seek a job when I'm done with school (whether that is just four years or further graduate study I have not yet decided), but to find some tiny (probably closet-resembling) apartment and write for a living. Of course, this will most likely include some kind of part time job...hopefully something creative or at least interesting. Don't get me wrong. I don't WANT to live the life of a struggling artist...it's just that I can't think of myself being happy doing anything other than writing. I want to be happily earning a high five-figure income from my writing, but that may take a little while to build up to. In fact, as I'm sure is every writer's secret dream, I would love to be easily earning a six-figure income, but that would take years to build to, and even if I wrote my whole life, it may never happen.  At some (hopefully still young) point in my life, I want to have the freedom to travel...around the country and around the world. I want to see Germany again, and the rest of Europe. I want to see Russia and travel through Asia. I want to go to Australia and take a Caribbean cruise...that is the reason for all of the foreign language stuff.  But before I can do all of that, I first have to get through school. I've finally got it narrowed down to 13 schools: Middlebury College, Emerson College, Oberlin College, Susquehanna University, Ohio State University, Edinboro University, Hampshire College, SUNY Brockport, SUNY Purchase, Rutgers-New Brunswick, University of Pittsburgh, Wilson College, and Trinity College. Right now I'm leaning towards Pittsburgh, but that may be because I just read through their catalog.  I know I want to go to school in a major city...which means Susquehanna may leave the above list rather quickly. That's ok, though, because I have to get it down to 5-8 schools before my mum starts to take me to visit them, and before she'll pay for the applications (at least, I hope they'll pay for the applications).  On a slightly less stressful note, my one week intensive gymnastics class starts on Monday. I love summer sessions, because it only gets the students that are my own age and that really like doing what we do, as opposed to the regular season, when I teach classes of younger students than myself. Those groups always seem to have some kids that seem to be doing the class just for another activity, not because they love the sport.  I can't wait. My best friend, my other half, will be going, as will our favorite younger one, whom we refer to as my other half's 'Mini Me'. And I haven't seen my teacher since our show at the end of June. As this year's senior student, I got final say on the theme for our next end-of-the-year show. Seeing as this show will fall on July 1st, with the rehersal the night before, my teacher came up with the very appropriate theme of 'Christmas in July'. In fact, I've already got one of my songs.  I suppose thats all, then, seeing as how I have other things I need to do.

      (very early in the morning)  Yeah, it's been a few days since I wrote anything (although that last was actually really early the morning of the 15th).  Now I'm having problems remembering everything that went on...hold on...  Ok.  So the next morning (thursday), our first stop was to the concentration camp at Dachau.  It was completely depressing;  I took absolutely no pictures and bought no postcards.  I do not need such horrible reminders.  During the afternoon we traveled to Rothenburg, which was awesome for shopping.  I got so much there.  My stuff is so heavy.  I finally found a hoodie for me.  I shared a room with Jenn and Brooke.  I spent a lot of time in Susan and Liz's room because everyone else was drinking.  We (Susan and I) played cards with two guys on our tour from Indiana:  John and Alan.  They is kool.  On friday we spent the day in Heidelburg, where we went on a city tour and did a lot of shopping.  I roomed with Susan and Liz.  We hung out again with John and Alan.  Liz smoked her last cigarette.  The other four girls had fun messing with the guy's room while they were drinking with Jimmy and Zach.  Since they were all on the balcony connected to our room, Liz kept them busy.  I also spent some time out in the hotel's Biergarten with some of the Louisiana people on our tour.  After some amount of time, the five of us (Susan, Liz, Alan, John, and I)got to watch funny druck people (Jimmy and Zach), which was amusing to say the least.   Today we took a cruise down the Rhine.  I sat with John in the front of the bus on the way and played cards with him and Alan.  I got an allergic reaction for the first time in Germany when we got to our restaurant for dinner.  That was no fun.  Afterwards, Susan and I hung with John and Alan and then we packed Susan's bags.  After room check and once Susan's bags were done, we came up with John to the room I'm sharing with Hilary and Kristen.  I packed, and the three of us played cards while everyone else went to the Diskotek.  John and I didn't go becuase it's not our scene, and Susan didn't go because Frau basically told us not to.  Everyone came back around three in the morning plastered.  Liz included, even though she swore she wouldn't do it again.  Hilary and Kristen cam in, also totally plastered and accompanied by Reid, Dan, Jenn, Brooke, and two guys on our tour, Arron and Eric.  Reid is really good at taking care of drunk people, I'll give him that.  Now I'm just watching them sleep it off.   So glad I'm coming home.  Over and out.

      Oh, the drama.  You know how I wrote about the gathering at Susan's room?  Well, it got a whole lot more exciting than planned at around 1:30 in the morning.  Liz drank way too much.  First she had a beer downstairs, then the three she had bought at the gas station, then finished Susan's, of which she had only had a few sips, and then she finished someone else's.  By the third or fourth, people were trying to get her to stop, but she wouldn't listen.  When Susan tried to take her's back (she didn't want it, but she didn't want Liz to drink anymore), she smacked Susan.  She kept insisting that she was fine, but by her fifth or sixth, she had to run into Susan's bathroom, where she proceeded to throw up all over everything.  At this point Susan was so upset that she came down to my room crying.  A little while later, while I was trying to calm Susan down, a couple people brought Liz into my room to sleep it off.  Why?  Because on her way out the front door to smoke a cigarette, she threw up in the lobby.  The night manager luckily thought she was part of one of the other schools, so he called their Frau, livid.  She sweet-talked him him into calming down, then Joe and Hilary talked him down to not calling our Frau, because then we could have been in major trouble.  Frau could have sent Liz home at her own expense, and because of the arrangements, we would all have been involved.  So then she was sleeping on our floor, and when Hilary came back, she woke up and started insisting that she was fine and needed to get to her room before she got in trouble.  We told her she couldn't wake up strangers, expecially since one was an adult, at 2:30 in the morning, and also that Susan and Jenn had written a note that Liz was staying in a friend's room.  She was insistent (although still drunk) so we called for Kristen, who was still upstairs talking to the guys.  Joe came down with her and managed to calm her into staying put and sleeping, but as soon as he left, she started at it agian, and it was all we could do to keep her quiet so as not to wake up other rooms.  By the time we got to sleep ourselves, it was past three in the morning, and we woke to find Liz huddled at the end of Kristen's bed because she was cold.  Kristen was not very happy.  In the meantime, the other Frau cleaned the lobby, refusing teh help that Joe offered.  She and the woman along with her, Fran, have been great in all of this.  As for the rest of my day, it was rather boring.  The idea of seeing the Neuschwanstein Castle was sounding really cool, until we realized it was over a three mile hike up to it and then we only saw about four rooms.  Turns out, most of it was never completed because the King (Ludwig II)was removed from the throne and then died (three days later) without it being finished.  The most exciting part of that was seeing the outside up close.  I also managed to get lots of cool postcards and some gifts at the shop.  After that, we stopped at die Wiesekirche, another of the Mad King's castles, and the monastery that wrote the Passion Play.  The church was very pretty, as was the castle, though I didn't pay to take the tour.  Oberamergau, the village that performs the Passion Play, was dull, except that I was able to find another gift. Now I only have to get two more, and something for myself.  Oh, and I  finished the book last night, and once again, READ IT.  Ok, so now off to bed, as it is already well into tomorrow.

      Having my own room was so nice. Granted, I stayed up so late reading that I still only got about three hours of sleep, but I don't care. The bus ride to Nueremburg (we switched from Rothenburg) took more than four hours because we got stuck in traffic. Despite its fame, it's really rather boring. The ride to Munich took about another two hours. Everyone slept, but I discovered that I just can not sleep sitting up on a moving vehicle. I decided to read instead, and am almost finished.  I'm gonna just say, that its excellent, and you should read it. I don't care who you are, read it. It's Sons of Fortune by Jeffery Archer.  All we've done in Munich is a city tour by bus, so of course we did more dozing off than listening.  We ate dinner at the hotel, and it was great (and that isn't sarcasm). We had potato soup, them wienerschnitzel, which is like ground pork. It was WUNDERBAR. If I hadn't been full, I would have asked for more.  Over breakfast and then again a bit during dinner, I talked to Frau about education. She agreed with my liking Middlebury College, because of it's awesome languages program. In fact, she informed me that when you major in a language, you live on a dorm floor where everyone has pledged to speak only that language while on your floor. How cool is that?  I've decided that I want to continue my formal education in German, no matter where I end up going to school, and maybe even try to add another language or two. I want to come back here, maybe through a study abroad program, but definitely on my own too (of course I would bring Ray with me, that's just a given). I want to come back with someone (or someones) that can act civilized and be more serious about the experience.  Tonight and tomorrow (we're in Munich two nights) I'm rooming with Hilary and Kristen. This room is seriously small (think closet) with three beds stuffed in it, when it's meant for two.  After dinner, we all went out to roam for a bit. We found the closest gas station, and I got myself some junk food. Everyone else got beer. Right now the rest of the girls are down in the bar having a beer, so Frau doesn't get suspicious. Then they were planning to get together in Susan, Brooke, and Jenn's room after Frau has checked on us all.  Personally, I am content just to sit here and write, and since I have nothing left, I going to read.

      Ok, so last time I forgot to meantion that we were the only group of three that was able to make it to dinner; when we went to dinner last night with everone, we got chichen currey soup. Hmm, I wonder if they made that fresh? I think not. So that dinner basically sucked again.  We had to be on the bus this morning by eight to ride to Dresden. The city is beautiful. The inner city is all the old buildings, which are georgeous, but we had too much free time, so we got bored. I sat under the main statute with Susan and LIz for the last 45 minutes of free time. After that, we had a city tour with a local guide (as opposed to Gerwin, our tour director, who stays with us the whole trip) which was boring because we had just seen most of what he was talking about. I did manage, however, to get pictures of the Volkswagon manufacturer where you can come to see your car finished. Actually, I'll probably end up deleting those, because they are crappy-looking and my camera is already running out of room.  After that we visited an art museum (boring), but it was really an old castle (KOOL), so it's all good. It was the Zwinger (I'm going to have to look that up sometime, because I need better pictures).  We went to dinner at a brewery, and it wasn't too bad. I mean, I only ate the pork, but still...at least this makes two nights where I at least had some meat (I did eat the chicken at the New Zealand place in Berlin last night as well).  Tonight I actually get a room all to myself (YES!), and that's where I am right now. Just like our hotel in Berlin, the Hotel Agon, this one is really nice.  Oh, I almost forgot. For lunch today I got a cone of chocolate ice cream, and I swear, it's the best I've ever had! I also got chicken nuggets from McDonald's, but only becasue we were in a mall. Frau doesn't want us to go into an actual McD's restaurant.  Tomorrow we leave for Munich at 7:30, with a stop first at Rothenburg; I'm going to have to get up early.  On my, but you would not believe the drama. I know I didn't. Fist off, Hilary apparently has this whole elaborate plan to get Joey back. Of course, Susan doesn't think she wants him back, but rather, just wants to use him. Since she's talked to more people than I have, I think I'll believe her. And Joey or no Joey, Hilary has been acting like a frigging princess, and so she has almost all of us (at least the girls) peeved at her.  Liz, too, is causing trouble. She has been annoying Bubba (Chris) the whole trip, and it doesn't help that he had never liked her in the first palcve. He's even keeping a tally of how many times she's annoyed him-we're one Day 4, and he's already over 250. She's been bugging everone else, too, because she's loud (which just serves to prove the idea that Europeans have that Americans are loud), and insultingly blunt, unnecessarily rude, and doesn't understand the word 'STOP'. She's constantly talking about some of our group being drunk (when no one has been) or sleeping with each other (which is also unfounded, since she was talking about Susan and Bubba, dispite the fact that Susan has a boyfriend of over a year at home and has never even come close to having sex). She's not listening to anyone, going so far as to tell me off for telling her not to shout down a crowded street (in English). Honestly. Well, it's bed time for me, so ttyl.

      Yeah, so I never wrote again last night.  Deal with it.  So the dinner last night was GREAT!  NOT!!  I did almost finsih the tomato soup and bread that was the first course, but I couldn't make  myslef eat more than the first two bites of the chicken currey (the main course).  Lucky for me, there was a salad with it.  Guess what?   We get to eat there again tomorrow night!  Yay!  All because our tour guide really liked it.  No, he loved it, and he totally scarfed it down.  Today we took a tour of Berlin.  This city is awesome.  I would totally come back.  I dot some of my gifts too, and lots of cool pictures.  So now I'm off to dinner again.

      So the transatlantic flight was no better.  In fact, it was worse, because it was so much longer.  And I tried...really, really hard...to fall asleep, but I couldn't.  The lady in front of me put her chair back for most of the flight, so I couldn't lean on the tray in front of me to sleep.  Then, when I went to put my own chair back, I found that I couldn't...because the person behind me had stuffed too much under it...so I got no sleep.  I am, in fact, writing this in my hotel room before we go out to dinner.  So I have been up for about 30 hours straight...and this from a girl who gets tired after being awake for eight or nine hours.  Because we're all completely wiped out, the only thing we've done today was visit the Pergamonmuseum, which is actualy a museum of all the different things that Germany had taken from other nations over the years.  Almost all of it was really impressive, but the awe was completely drowned out in our zombie-like state.  After that, we went in search of food...incredibly difficult to do, it turns out...at least if you want to find anything that looks edible.  And no, I swear, I was not being picky.  The only stuff I turned down were things I alrerady know I didn't like.  I even tried both airline meals.  The chicken and rice that I got as dinner only lasted two bites, because it was rubbery and absolutly saturated in some kind of sauce that was just vile.  The ham and cheese "sandwich" in a roll that was breakfast lasted just one bite of the bread.  Obviously they had been pre-made and then stored, because the bread tasted like the cheese.  Beyond that, I've had a couple SlimFast bars, some candy snackage, and all we found for lunch today was some great-tasting fries.  So, needless to say, I am in the mood for some real food.  Hopefully I will like something this restaurant we're going to has to offer, because if not...it's a SlimFast bar for me.  I swear, when I start doing vacations on my own, I am going to plan them by comfort level...none of this cost effective crap.  If that means I take a really great vacation once in a while instead of a mediocre one frequently, then so be it!  I'll probably write more after dinner, but for now, I'm going to do some more reading.

      Ok, so obviously, I didn't really post this on this date...as I was in Germany.  But now that you can change the date of the post manually, I thought I'd try it.  So here goes:  First flight ever was quite interesting...not.  By the time we were at the point where I could turn my music on, I ended up only having time to listen to about three songs before it was time to land and I had to turn off my DJ.   Long flight, huh? And the stewardess was mean.

      So yesterday I passed my roat test, so now I can drive......at least, that's what I believe.  My father, apparently, does not hold that same idea.  And tomorrow, I must wake up insanely early.........5:30, at the latest......to get to Buffalo for my flight.  In the meantime, I must: go to walmart for all those last minute essentials, finish my letter to Paula, finalize a packing list, make a list of gifts, pack, call all my friends, find something to do in this town just this side of nowhere, and get to bed at a reasonable time........like never....so now I leave.  Cya!

      For the love of music........my other half left his cd case the last time he was here at my house, so now i am in the process of copying all of his music that i don't already have to my computer.  He's just so useful!  I'm beginning to count down the days to my travels to Germany......6 days, at the moment.  I really want to go, but I also really want the stuff I ordered over the internet to come in first.  Ray (did I meantion his name yet?  If not, he is my other half) agreed to redo my braids before I go to germany.........He's also streaking some color into it.......we just have not yet decided on the color.  He wants to do hot pink, but that just is not my color.  I'm thinking blue, but I'm not sure that would show so well, since I have brown hair.  Geez, I almost wish I were a blonde, because then almost anything would go.  I might go with black lowlights, for now at least.  Maybe in the future I'll do something more bold.  gots to go now............dinna!

      Totally random thoughts.........I guess I haven't written here in a while....oh, well, the internet's feelings are not hurt very easily, me thinks.  Finally got my hair braided, though it's only 29 braids, unlike the link I put in earlier.  I've just found further inspiration for writing, so I must go do that now.  Buhbye!

      I know I haven't written anything in a while, but that is just because there has been nothing to write about.  Ah, the infuriating boredom of summer.  Anyways, some relative that were visiting, an aunt and uncle, have just left, and I have to say (somewhat guiltily) that I'm relieved.  Of all my aunts and uncles (and both my parents have four married siblings, so theres a lot of them), they just may be my least favorite to be around.  This is mainly because they are rather stiff, definitely opinionated, and not afraid to share their views.  In fact, they have no problem in asking me a question only to go off on their own tangent long before I'm finished answering.  It's very annoying.  I feel guilty though, because it is obvious that they care about me...in fact, they gave me money for my trip to Germany.  I have been narrowing my list of colleges lately, because I don't want to take anymore standardized tests.  I'll have enough to worry about with my college classes.  This means that I won't be applying to any college that requires more than the SAT I score.  Oh well.  I have a feeling that I will end up at the University of Pittsburgh, which was the first school that really caught my eye and remains my favorite.  Or at least, it's my favorite within my mother's radius of acceptable hours away from home.  I have to head over to church pretty soon.  Hopefully I'll have no kids to watch, so that I can sit through the whole sermon.  That's what I love about church in the summer.  There is no Sunday School, so the parents don't make their kids stay for church, so I have no one that needs to be watched.  Ugh, after that, I have to go dress shopping for my cousin's wedding next weekend.  I  hate  dresses.  Oh, well.  I don't suppose she would appreciate my coming in jeans, and I wouldn't want to upset her day with even the smallest problem, so there you have it.  I wish Ray had been free to come with me, though, as my aunt invited him after she came down to our campsite recently.  I think that she may have gotten the impression he was my boyfriend or something, seeing as how he was sitting in my lap (there were no more chairs left).  *chuckle*.  We had a good laugh about that. hahahaha.
