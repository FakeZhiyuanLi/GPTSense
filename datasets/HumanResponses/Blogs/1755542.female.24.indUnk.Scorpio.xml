      Well, packing is actually getting finished and I think I can see the end to all of this in sight.  I had a great time with Gail today getting tummy shots.  We also had a very nice dinner tonight with Dr. Secor and his wife and are so excited to have their support in the upcomming months.  The mixture of emotions that I am feeling is nothing short of amazing.. excitement, fear, anticipation, worry, joy, gratefulness.

      Wow!  We finally found a name for this spot and decided to put this up!  We are so excited about using this to keep in touch with friends and to describe our adventures as we travel to Canada for 10 months to attend Augustine College.  Right now we are focusing our time on packing our apartment and getting everything to go.  Thanks for comming by and we look forward to sharing with you!

        Praises   Thank you for prayers.  The downside to Dad's being retired is that money is a little tight for Mom to come visit baby & me this November.  The upside is that Dad is a member of AARP and can get a lower-priced airline ticket for Mom.  Cool huh?  Please keep praying for us.  Please pray especially that God will grant us wisdom in how we spend our resources including our time.  Things are getting very busy now and I think our time here at Augustine College will give us enough to think about for our whole lives.

           We've been busy the last few days and are beginning to get a taste of what this year is going to be like.  I apologize for not keeping up with the blog and we hope to be better in the future when things get rushed.  Ryan actually did begin a blog on Wednesday but still hasn't finished it so I may encourage him to do that when I am finished.  Then you'll be able to read about what we are learning in our science, medicine, and faith class.        We've spent the last couple weeks looking at the dawning of western culture and studying the contributions of the early Greeks.  The development of reason as we know it today began with the Greeks and even now influences the way we approach people, the world, and matters of Faith.  I wonder why God led the Greeks along the paths He did and planted his church among a bed of Greek thought.  Was He preparing a people who would desire truth so that they could accept Christ when he appeared?  I'm interested to see what we will find when we reach the time of the early church in our studies.  What parts of the Greek-Roman world and thought did they accept/acknowledge/incorporate and what things did they reject?  This also leads me to think about the approach of the Gospel in cultures which are not reason based.   How does the Word speak to peoples who are not bound by laws of logic?  What does passion for the truth look like among such people when they have been reborn in Christ?  One of the girls who is studying here is the daughter of a missionary doctor who worked in Pakistan.  She speaks of the frustration of trying to dialogue with people who don't accept our sense of logic and reason, people who grow up being taught that two conflicting ideas can be right at the same time.  Try explaining that the Gospel is the most reasonable of any of the religions (as we try in our society) and they say they have a different way of reasoning.  Perhaps there the road to Christ is not one of reasoned conclusion but of faithful allegiance to a God who has met the needs of a person's soul.  Conversion is not concurrent with but contrary too the wisdom of the culture.  We have been blessed to grow up in a culture permeated by a Christian past and it is to that past that we owe an idea of reason, of wisdom that points to the ways of God.  Yet, it may be that we reach faith by the same path as those in Pakistan.  I have heard it said that you can't talk someone into accepting Christ.  This becomes even more obvious as we enter a time of postmodernity when reason is subject, authority of the past questioned.        Well... those are some of my thoughts at the moment.  I'll catch up with everyone again later.  By the way, it's starting to get cool here.  My Texas brain is just starting to comprehend the frozen furry that is about to descend on us.  Pray that we don't become popsicles :)

           Tuesday night we had the second in a series of public lectures given by Professor Mark Whittall.  The lecture series will follow the development of science from a preliterate worldview through three major scientific revolutions to the state of science in the West today.  Professor Whittall started out by giving various definitions of science and then choosing a broad definition that would encompass science in ancient, medieval, enlightenment, and modern societies.  Thus we are looking at science as "the answers we give to the questions we ask about the world around us (nature)."  Someone quickly noted that this definition does not exclusively indicate many of the beliefs or practices we now associate with science.  It can in truth describe many non-scientific things such as mysticism and mythology because there is no criteria given for what sorts of answers are valid.  This is necessary however if we are going to look at the development of the modern scientific worldview without distorting ancient peoples' approaches to nature by attempting to conform them to our conception of science.       The first scientific model we looked at is the Animist or Magical worldview.  This is presumably the understanding of the world held by prehistoric peoples.  However, given that prehistoric people by definition left no written language we must make conjectures about their beliefs from remnants in the earliest known writings and by looking at contemporary preliterate societies.      These cultures were oral cultures and they used stories to explain the world around them.  These stories did so by projecting what people knew onto what they didn't know.  Just as today we model things we don't know, an electron, with things we do know, a billiard ball or a wave.  However, instead of abstracting reality to common laws or principles they tended to personalize and individualize the forces and situations.  Most included creation stories that explained how the world came to exist in the context of a birth.  They anthropomorphised the sky, sun, moon, earth, forest, river, and ocean to be like something they knew about- people.  These stories were fluid as can be seen in the early Egyptian records by the many variety of creation myths that were often contradictory.  This was not seen as a problem because it is hard to critically compare stories that only exist orally.  The stories that flourished both gave explainations of the world and tended to reinforce the values of the community; it is dangerous to disturb the social structure by which people survive in a preliterate society.      In Animistic societies there is no distinction between what is natural, what is human, and what is supernatural.  The priests in Egypt practiced mathematics, astronomy, astrology, and mystical rites all as one profession.  Similarly healers in Egypt and Babylon practiced magic, rituals, and exorcism to treat disease which was understood to be caused by evil spirits while at the same time utilizing surgery and plants for pharmacological recipes.      The Greeks would be instrumental in what we will call the First Scientific Revolution in which the Animistic worldview was replaced with a new paradigm.  However, the new paradigm would incorporate many of the scientific developments of the earlier civilizations.  These include the Egyptian and Babylonian arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, astrology, and calendars.      In summation of the Animistic/ Magical worldview notable characteristics are: -no clear distinction between natural and supernatural -personalize and individualize causes, causes identifies with "beings" (gods, spirits, humans) -natural phenomena caused by "capricious" gods, with no discernible order -the use of rituals and incantations to gain favor with gods and spirits      Later I will blog about the paradigm shift to the Aristotelian scientific model.       One interesting note is that the Biblical worldview is set specifically against this animistic/magical worldview.  While it may also challenge our current worldview, we must keep in mind the context that the Bible was originally set against and what it was originally meant to answer.  This gives us more insight into the Bible's message and why certain things were included that seem rather odd or irrelevant to us today.  (What was that about not boiling a calf in its mother's milk?  The thought had truly never occured to me.)

      Today has been a good day.  We had Latin from 8:30-9:30  I came home and made banana bread (4 loaves) some of which the Augustine College guys came over and helped us dispose of.  I am making a New England Boiled Dinner (never had it, just found a recipe) for supper tonight.  I am looking forward to a busy week and feel like I may actually learn Latin.  I got to spend some cuddly time with Joshua on the couch.  I found out that my best friend is actually going to be able to come visit us over US's Thanksgiving (which is different from Canada's)  And we may actually be able to get our student visas in two weeks!  I may actually be able to stay enough on top of things so that this baby's birth will not put me too far behind and I can catch up by the end of the semester.  Should I pray for an earlier-ish birth to make things easier?  I am praying for God's timing and for the patience to accept whatever it may be.  Hello to all who are keeping up with us.  We miss you.

      Hello this Sunday!  I am going to post quite a few pictures today because I really want to give people who are not here a picture of what we are doing.  Of course we are not very consistant with the camera so just because there are more pictures of swimming and eating does not mean that we are neglecting our studies! :)  It is just that when we are studying, taking a picture is not the first thing on our minds.  It is also not very interesting to take pictures of people studying.  Anyway, here are our pics with a few explanations:  First, here is our apartment:         Pic. of our hall and washroom and laundry machines,  Josh's and my bedroom, and Josh in our rocking chair         These are pics of our kitchen, our living room (the two are one big room) and Ryan with our books       Here is Ryan's room (which is actually bigger, but I couldn't get a good angle) and our study/Guest room    Here is a picture of me and my growing belly.  Only 5-7 weeks left!  I can't wait to see this baby!        Here are some impressive pictures of the swim party that the guy students at Augustine College had last weekend      Here is the meal that the guys ate after swimming (remember... pizza and pork chops!)    And here is Joshua studying Latin.  I think  in my next post I will list the books we are reading and what is happening in our classes since that is the main reason that we are here.  Meanwhile, I must away to study Latin myself.    Please, as a special prayer request, pray that there would be some way my mom can come up within a few weeks after the baby is born.  Financial stuff is restricting my parents from being able to come and it would be so nice for both her and me if she was able to be here.  If God would be so gracious, it would also be nice for my dad to be able to come and see the baby.  Anyway, I know that the people who check this page are praying for us and I thought I would pass along that specific request.  Thank you.

      Hey!  We finally figured out how to put pictures in our posts!  Here are a few of our church community before we left Dallas.  Enjoy :)      This is the Rudd family; Joshua, _____ Here's Janiece and Allyson.   Kristen and baby Judah ___________ Don't blink Janiece :)   And here is the Holy Reverend Thames... hehe... well... Mark will do.

      Some of you may find this amusing.  Apparently there have been recurrent times during class discussions when Ryan and I say something and Janiece looks over expecting to see Mark sitting there.  I guess others should take this as a warning that if you spend too much time around Mark and his uniqueness it starts to wear off on you :)  Love you Mark!

      We visited the St. Paul University library yesterday.  Our school acquires rights to their library for us because it has one of the most extensive collections in theology, medieval history and philosophy around.  When the library was begun it was formed of mostly donated texts and has quite a collection of rare books.  We even saw a section of books which is regularly locked up and contains texts hundreds of years old.  The oldest tome (literally 1ft by 2ft by 5in) was a copy of Saint Aquinas' Catina aurea printed in 1475!  Many of the books in the library are in other languages making me wish I had spent a years tutelage as C.S.Lewis did learning Greek, Latin, German, French and Italian.  Alas, I think Latin will be enough for me at this time.    We truly are blessed to be able to study under the instruction of the professors here.  They are each greatly gifted in there own ways.  Our Art history professor is a poet at heart and his expressive abilities when reading the Bible, prose or poetry aloud are unmatched in my experience.  We are arranging with him now to teach us the art of reading aloud.  We are also pursuing teaching by other professors in the skills of public speaking.  To be able to use my voice effectively in teaching and encouraging is one of the many aims I had hoped to pursue in my studies this year and I praise God for His amazing provision in this area.  Well, Latin calls so I must bid you farewell.

      Salvete! (Greetings in Latin) Joshua is lying on the guest bed behind me reciting his Latin verbs and conjugations.  I am excited to learn Latin as it is a language that has played a major part in the Western world.  For centuries it was the language of learning and the Catholic Church.  In truth however I have always been more eager to learn Greek as it is the language of the Gospel and New Testement writings.  I asked Dr. Patrick about the choice of language to be taught at Augustine and he said that it had originally come down to a decision between Greek and Latin.  The decision eventually sided with Latin for the reason that there is more untranslated material in Latin than in Greek.  However, one of the past classes at Augustine was so convinced that Greek would be equally usefull that they asked the Latin teacher, Professor Bloedow (who actually has his Ph.D. in Greek history), to teach them Greek on the side.  I don't know if I am that ambitious;)  Another consideration is the fact that we can probably find someone to teach us Greek in the future wherever we end up.  In order to make best use of our time at Augustine we should focus on learning the things that are uniquely availible here.  The main example is the integration of the spectrum of western education in the context of the Christian revelation.  Other things that we are looking into are learning sessions on oration and rhetoric from some of the professors who excel in speaking.  And yes, for those of you who have had the opportunity to hear Dr. Patrick speak, there are others here whose oration abilities reach beyond even his.  Well, I must return to my work.  We have Latin tomorrow and for Science, Medicine, and Faith Dr. Patrick has assigned an essay on the first chapter of The Beginnings of Western Science.  And so the nose begins its steady journey to the unyielding surface of the grindstone! Valete!

      Social Time! So we ARE studying!  But there are currently no papers due and the workload has not become intense yet (as it has promised to become...) so we are taking this time to get to know our classmates.  Yesterday Josh and Ryan went swimming at one of the guy's places and then apparently had a great dinner of pizzas and pork chops at the school with all of the guys.  (pizza and pork chops?  I would have never matched those two up!)  I, on the other hand had some wonderful quite time and then the girls came over here for great conversation, pizza, and a movie.  What fun!    Today we went to church and took a long nap.  I was really surprised by how long we slept and it is a little shameful so I won't tell you.  :)  Then because I am  having bothersome reflux and a little behind on my Latin I stayed home while the guys went back up to the school and ate dinner with everyone there.  Apparently they had tacos and soup!  Wonderful!  Even in Canada we can have Mexican food.    Meanwhile, I am trying to figure out how to put our pictures on the web site.  Thank you for your patience and keep checking back because we will get them up eventually and then you can see what we are up to.    Hello to my parents (both sets!) if they are keeping up with us.  And many greetings going out to our community and friends.  Thank you so much to everyone who made this possible.    ps We are coming home (to Dallas) Dec. 15 through Jan. 2 and would love to see anyone.  Our friend Joshua is working on setting up a way for everyone to comment directly to our blog so when that starts to work perhaps we can schedule get-togethers.  (And you can meet the baby!!)  pss keep in mind that it is a 30 minute walk to the school as we don't have a car so we are also getting in lots of wonderful exercise!  I so enjoy walking and I really missed it in Dallas.  When the snow gets thick, however, I think we will just take the bus.  *grin*

      We are here and classes have started!  So far we have had Latin, Art and Theology, and Science and Technology (taught by Dr. Patrick).  Classes are going very well so far as we are not really into them far enough to be absorbed with assignments yet.  Last night was the public lecture and it was given by Rev. Doug Hayman.  By public lecture I don't mean that the lecture was out on the street corner or anything but it was in the basement of a nearby church and was open to  anyone who wanted to attend.  Rev. Hayman talked about believing in order to understand which was taken from a quote by St. Augustine.  He used the last of Luke 2 and John 3:1-12 as texts.  People seemed to get hung up on the John 3 passage in verse 5 where Jesus talks about being born on water and the Spirit.  I didn't know this until afterwards, but everyone seemed to be trying to apply both the water-birth and the Spirit-birth to what has to happen to "enter the kingdom of God."    Rev. Hayman briefly mentions how babies are born with a breaking of the water and so we must also be born through the Holy Spirit.  So, off goes my pregnant-mind thinking about how amazing physical birth is and replaying memories of births that I have been to where I have gotten to see the bag of waters break right there in the  mother's opening and the baby's head slide so beautifully through after a brief gush of water.  Then I start thinking about how cool it is that Christ used such an amazing picture to parallel what must happen to us when we are born of His Spirit.  I am also, just now, realizing how feminine of a picture that is.  I don't know if birth was regulated to "women's work" at that time, but Christ just took an image in which the pregnant female is a necessary part of and applied our spiritual rebirth to it.  Hmmm... this will require further thought. Anyway, this was the course of my thoughts last night and since I was so lost in my own head I was only occasionally tuning into the conversation around me.  Apparently most everyone lost the illusion that Christ was making to a physical birth and began to discuss what role baptism had in our spiritual rebirth.  I didn't realize this at the time or I would have spoken up and said "Hey!  The water-birth is about our physical birth, Christ is saying, we must be physically born and then spiritually born in order to enter God's Kingdom."  I, however, was completely tuned out.  I didn't know people were seeking for a meaning for the water-birth part of that verse.  This just goes to show how being pregnant is wonderful, but distracting and often keeps me from being fully aware of everything around me.  Oh well, perhaps I will bring it up again in our Scriptures class on Thursday.    Meanwhile, I will begin a search on what Christ says about our spritual rebirth and how that very feminine image fits in with it all.

      We are here and finally connected!  God has been so good in taking care of us and we are excited about school starting next Monday.  Guess what?  We have a rocking chair in our apartment!  Is that a blessing or what?!?  Also, the church that we visited last Sunday seems great with almost everyone coming from a different country.  The pastor is from Brazil, he spent 2 years in Iraq, he is married to a lady from the US who was an IMB missionary to Brazil until they got married.  Well, his wife has been replacement "mother" to several ladies in the church who have had babies, especially during their labors.  Could this be a sweet answer?  Perhaps!  The weather is a nice change from Texas but I still miss the people there.  If anyone reads this before going to LGBC on Saturday, please pass on my love to them.  We look forward to seeing you all again at Christmas and you will get to see our little one!  OK, more later.  If anyone does read this, please let us know!  :)  It is always nice to know you are talking to someone out there....

      Hello,  sorry we haven't written in awhile.  We're trying to upload some new pictures of Janiece's growing belly but the blogger site is malfunctioning.  We'll get them up as soon as possible.  Janiece's due date is today so we look forward to having a baby sometime in the next two weeks!  Pray for us that God will watch over Janiece and the baby as the birth nears.  I can't wait to hold my little child!!!

      Howdy! Here is a portion of an essay I have been writing for the Science, Medicine, and Faith class.  Still needs some work and paring down for the requirements of the assignment but I thought this might be illuminating as a continuation on the development of the Aristotelian worldview.  I will blog later with a more concise summary of Aristotelianism.  Enjoy!  Near the turn of the fourth century BC the pre-Socratic philosophers of ancient Greece had scratched out the beginnings of a new scientific worldview that would eventually replace the Animistic or Magical model of the ancient world.  They asked, “Of what is the world made?” and their answers pointed to a simplicity underlying the surface complexity.  They asked, “What is the nature of change?” and found that reason argued for fixed stability in spite of the illusion of unceasing change.  The disparity between the philosophers’ reasoned answers to these questions and what the senses actually observed about the world brought to light another issue, the problem of knowledge.  Is true knowledge rational knowledge or sensual knowledge?  The pre-Socratics argued these three issues back and forth, in the process developing rules of reasoned argument and logic.  However, in the end they were left with a muddle of conflicting and disjointed suppositions.  They lacked any means of working through these ideas to formulate an integrated and comprehensive scientific model, without which no true scientific advances could be made.  For without a comprehensive worldview the Greek philosophers possessed no way of determining which ideas were important; which observations mattered.  It was into this vacuum that the two greatest natural philosophers of antiquity, Plato and his student Aristotle, each introduced his comprehensive system of philosophy.  Plato (427-348BC) was a student of the philosopher Socrates and founded a school known as the Academy in Athens where young men could study philosophy.  He wrote a number of highly influential works, all in the form of dialogues.  Plato addressed the issue of the nature of rational knowledge vs. sensuous knowledge with the concept of a world of ideas or forms.  Using the example of a carpenter constructing a table Plato explained that the carpenter started with the idea of a true table in his mind.  He would then attempt to craft a replica of that idea in the material world, with each effort at a table only partially successful.  Plato stated that in such a way there was a realm of the forms in which existed the perfect forms of the many changeable and imperfect objects we see around us.  In the world of the forms existed the true form of a table, a dog, a tree, a man, or even the true form of a thing like beauty.  In Plato’s conception the material world is simply an imperfect and changeable expression of the forms that was created by a divine craftsman, the Demiurge.  In this way Plato was able to reconcile unchanging stability in the world of the forms with change found in the corruptible material world.  He also answered the question of knowledge by affirming rational knowledge at the expense of sense experience, which comes from a world of imperfect “copies” of the forms.  Thus to Plato the road to true knowledge was not through observation but through philosophical meditation.  Plato also placed a high value on mathematics, namely geometry.  Before founding his Academy Plato is believed to have traveled to Italy where he came in contact with the Pythagoreans, a group of pre-Socratic philosophers who believed that the world was made up of or based upon numbers.  Plato was influenced by their thought to such an extent that he is said to have inscribed over the entrance to his Academy “Let no one unversed in geometry enter here”.  In geometry one may attempt to draw shapes such as a triangle or a circle but what the geometrician is truly studying are the mathematical laws of a perfect triangle and a perfect circle, thus one is actually studying the form.  Plato believed that the study of mathematics could help a person to escape the material world of the senses and learn to know the world of the forms.  Plato did not completely discount the world of the senses.  Because it was based off the world of the forms he thought that a man might be reminded of the perfect forms that his soul knew in a previous existence by observing many imperfect examples of them in the material world.  He also thought there was utility in contemplating the material world to see the orderliness, the mathematical design of things, as proof that it was the creation of a divine craftsman.  One can see similarities in modern science to some aspects of Plato’s philosophy, namely the attempt to “idealize” objects in order to learn the laws governing them as well as the practice of expressing these laws in mathematics.  Aristotle was a student in Plato’s Academy until the elder philosopher’s death.  He was greatly influenced by Plato’s thought but differed with him on some major issues.  Aristotle retained Plato’s forms but stated that they had no reality apart from the material in which they were found.  He developed the theory that ideas were abstractions that were perceived by people’s minds but that existed not in a separate world of forms but rather existed in each specific imperfect example in nature.  He answered the problem of stability vs. change by claiming that the permanent unchanging thing was the form or abstracted similarity that existed in the many varied examples of that form found in matter.  The form of a dog was the thing that makes all specific dogs belong to the class of dog, however each individual dog was imperfect and changing.  Also, the mind of a person was able to integrate the input of the individual senses such as sight, taste, and touch of an object and by observing the change of some of these while others remained the same (i.e. the change of color and smell of an apple while the texture and shape remained the same) the mind came to an understanding of the continuity of objects in the midst of change.  Thus Aristotle argued against the supposed contradiction of permanence vs. change that made the appearance of change an illusion.  He stated that a thing that was changing was in the process of becoming.  The inherent form, or the “formal cause”, and the ultimate purpose, or the “final cause” determined what the thing was becoming, and these were unchanging.  In contrast to Plato, Aristotle championed observation as the source of true knowledge.  By observing the world and noting the similarities and differences between objects, living creatures, and happenings a person could draw out the common form and purpose of things.  Thus science involved observation and classification.  This approach was to dominate western science until the 1600’s AD.  In modern science one can see the remnants of this approach in the biological sciences.  Although many scientists are attempting to make this science conform to the mathematically descriptive model found in physics and other hard sciences they are still forced to fall back on a classification system based on similarities and differences between species and to explain organs and behaviors with reference to ultimate purpose and design.  Another similarity is Aristotle’s insistence on observation and modern science’s insistence on empirical evidence.  However, there are some vast differences underlying this similarity.  Aristotle was a great observer but he designed no experiments, which was a great hindrance in many of his studies.  There is a simple explanation for this: Aristotle was interested in the inherent nature of things, in what was natural, not what happened in the artificial environment of a modern controlled experiment.  In modern science we utilize aspects of both Plato’s and Aristotle’s natural philosophies.  From Plato we get the practice of idealizing diverse and imperfect examples to obtain an ideal model of the world, and we utilize mathematics to describe this idealization.  From Aristotle we get the emphasis on the necessity of empirical data and in the biological sciences we continue to classify and explain things by their purpose.  Valete!

      Salvete!  Paradigm Shift---> Aristotelian Scientific Model  Earlier I blogged about the first scientific worldview, typically referred to as the Animistic or Magical worldview. This involved answering questions about the world around us by personalizing and individualizing causes. For instance: This specific child became sick at this time because of an evil spirit. That storm blew through last evening because a god was angry. The world came to be because the sky loved the earth and they bore children. Such a worldview gives explanations of what the world is composed of (it is made of personalities, like people) and what causes things to happen (the very human-like and capricious acts of the spirits and gods in the world). Within this worldview people built up an impressive array of technologies: agriculture with accompanying calendars, astronomy and astrology, engineering, arithmetic and geometry, and medicine with no differentiation between natural and supernatural, between material or magical means.   In the western world among the Greek philosophers a new scientific model began to grow out of the Animistic model, building on its accomplishments while fundamentally altering the way people looked at the world around them.  The first of these were the Milesian philosophers from the Greek city in Ionian, present day Turkey.  Thales of Miletus lived at the beginning of the 6th century BC and he asked the same questions of the world as the people before him.  “What is the world made of?” and  “What causes things to happen in the world?”  However Thales answered these questions in a previously unknown way.  He said, “All things are made of water.”  While he may seem completely off base to us today, Thales had said something revolutionary.  He theorized that there was an underlying principle and order to the world, namely water, and that all complex things must in some way be constructed of this element.  Although in most aspects quite different from modern science, one can see a surprising similarity.  Instead of water, modern science believes that everything is composed of a small array of subatomic particles, or possibly quantum strings vibrating in ten dimensions.  The advantage of Thales’ idea over previous animistic models is that in simplifying things to a single basic impersonal element Thales introduced the possibility that the world could be controlled.  According to later Greek philosophers Thales also tried to support his assertion with logic, likely utilizing the fact that water could transform between vary different states: water vapor, liquid water, and ice to suppose that all matter could be formed from it in some way.  Thales introduced the idea that his assertion of the world must be logically based, and the advent of a simple writing system and comparatively high literacy rates allowed his ideas to spread and generate criticism.  Other philosophers followed and put forward other substances as the single principle behind all things; air and fire were among these.  Thales’ introduction of an unchanging, impersonal, rational element as the basis for the world introduced a new problem to the Greek philosophers, the problem of change.  Easily explained in a Magical Scientific model, change became a stumbling block for all later Greek philosophy.  The Eleatic philosophers Parmenides and Zeno highlighted this problem.  Parmenides argued that all change is logically impossible.  A thing either is (being) or is not (nothing).  A thing changing is becoming, which is not being and thus must be nothing.  This may sound rather silly considering what we witness everyday around us, but Parmenides argued that what we see must be an illusion since reason tells us it cannot be.  Zeno further supported this argument with his famous paradox.  He claimed that movement any distance is impossible, because first you must go half the distance, then half the remaining, and so on infinitely many times, which is impossible in a finite amount of time.  The work of these early Greek philosophers served to get people thinking about and discussing the nature of the world around them as well as introduced the idea that there was an order to it all.  However, things seemed to hit something of a wall there.  The different philosophers could propose material after material, basic principle after basic principle with no end in sight.  They did manage to get people thinking of things without the presence (interference?) of capricious deities, but this had something of an unforeseen result in the teachings of the sophists, who began to undermine the traditions and values of Greek society, arguing that the gods did not exist or could not be known and that man was the measure of all things.  It was into this rather chaotic scene in which the very foundations of knowledge were being challenged, both of the physical world and moral society, that Socrates made his contribution and shaped the future of philosophy.  Following Socrates came Plato and Plato’s student Aristotle whose work formed the foundation of scientific thought for the next two thousand years.  I will look more specifically at Plato and Aristotle’s scientific models and the Aristotelian Worldview in a later blog.  Got to go write a paper on whether I am a Platonic or Aristotelian scientist!  Valete!

      Autumn!  Wow!  Leaves really do change to gold, red, and orange.  The trees look as if they are on fire and it is beautiful to see a street covered in bright yellow leaves.  Isn't God amazing?   Our time on the farm was great!  Josh and Ryan got to help dig fence post holes and I dismantled part of a fence.  We were fed wonderful healthy food and came back very refreshed.     We are busy working on a term paper (one of several for the semester) that is due on Friday.  In Philosophy tomorrow we are discussing Augustine's Confessions Book 7 and the nature of Evil.  Then in Scriptures we are going to discuss several sermons written by John Chrysostom.  Josh has decided that he wants to keep up his Latin even after we finish here and would like to get several works in Latin to read.  There is a History account by Bede from 700-ish that Josh would like to have in Latin if that is the language that it was written in.  Does anyone know?  We probably need Mark or Vince to help us with this project.  Did you know that the liturgy of "high church" has its roots in synagogue worship?  I had always thought that liturgy had developed its "distant" feeling (my first impression only as I have experienced beautiful worship in liturgy also) over the centuries, but it actually came about as a way of worship that the first Christians (Jews) were used to.   In art we learned that the Church (I am not sure on the details as this is something that I want to look further into) developed a "formula" by which icons such as Mary and the saints were to be depicted by.  Their concern was not realism, but the meaning behind how the icons were painted.  For example, Mary is shown with a small mouth (showing humbleness), long skinny nose (not sure what this shows), and large eyes (I think representing innocence).  All of these characteristics were intended to convey ideas about who Mary was and not how she really looked.  What I am learning is really filling out my knowledge of the Early Church and is helping me to appreciate early Christian thought and works.

      Hi!  I've been busy at school, but I have had a little spare time to make some things for the baby.  I just thought I would show them off!   Here's Teddy in the baby sling I made.  No baby yet, but our dog sure fits it well!       And here is the Diaper Holder that I made (below it is a snow suit for winter time):    It is nice to be able to make a few things.  Many thanks go to my Mom-in-law who gave me the sewing machine.  We are off for the weekend to a sheep farm!  It is the Canadian Thanksgiving and a family is having us over.  It will be nice to be away from the city for a while.

      Fast Update!  Ok, sorry this will be short, but we need to go do research on a paper.  Josh, Ryan, and myself spoke Sunday to the church we are attending about missions and were so blessed to have the church pray for us that we could continue to follow God's will.  Then that afternoon a lady from our church brought over some baby winter clothes.  :)  Our little Canadian won't be an ice cube after all!    This weekend is Canada's Thanksgiving and a family that is associated with the school has invited us to their farm to celebrate.  We are thankful that so many people have accepted us so readily!  Also, on a prayer note, some money that we were depending on has not come through.  Last week we spent quite a bit of time being distracted about it and we really want to refocus this week on doing what God has put us here to do.  Please pray that we can trust God's provision and just live each day in His grace.  Love you all out there.   Sorry these have become even more infrequent but we are going to try and do a better post soon.  Thank you for your comments and prayers.

      Our birth supplies came in the mail yesterday!  The things that we will need to have this baby at home are here and so now all we need is a baby!  We still have some time though since the baby is not due until Oct 27.  Please don't bother me on that date if the baby is not yet here... It is perfectly normal for women to go over their dates and there is a fair chance that I will myself.  We have been doing prenatals just like a health care provider would do if we were still in the US and the baby has been doing great!  Heart rate is good and strong, growth is right on target, my blood pressure is where it is supposed to be, and we even ordered urine strips so we know that is doing well too!  :)  The baby has been very active and I think it is starting to realize that it will one day run out of room.  Every so often I have to massage a little part (foot?  knee?)  back down since it is sticking straight up.  Even though I am constantly amazed at how much my belly has stretched, it is not made of elastic and so sometimes this little baby's stretches hurt!  :)  Anyway, with the birth supplies came an unexpected customs/duty fee!  No more ordering new stuff for Janiece!  If anyone can clarify exactly how duties work I would appreciate it.  I think it is just on things that are brand new... anyway, some help in that would be nice so we don't have to pay any more large fees.  Tomorrow Ryan, Joshua, and I get to speak for a little bit on missions to the church we have been attending.  One of the many things that Joshua really wanted to learn while he was here was how to speak.  God is already giving him opportunities for that!    For everyone who is curious about the weather, it has gotten cold here!  We now wear our coats outside and yesterday evening I wore gloves to walk to the post office!  The leaves on the trees are changing to beautiful colors.  They say it usually doesn't snow until sometime in November so we still have some time for our blood to thicken up.    We miss you all and send our love.

      Visas! Horray.  Many thanks go to God for finally working things out for us to get our study visas.  For those who don't know, we have been "living" here as visitors while waiting on a lot of financial stuff to be worked out.  We had to prove to Canada that we would have enough money to live off of and pay tuition while here in Canada.  Much love and appreciation go to my mother who did some finagling in order to help us get our paperwork in order.  The result of quite a bit of stress and some phone calls is that we begin this weekend with our visas!  Good thing also because I am just over 36 weeks pregnant and if this baby were to come (as it is physiologically able to at this point) we need to prove that we are here legally.  God is very good in His provision even if it isn't in our timing!    We continue to need your prayers for God to cover us and lead us.  We still face spiritual attacks and sometimes find life overwhelming.  Life is good (not because any events may be good, but because God has given it to us), and it is nice to wake up in the mornings knowing we are where God has placed us.

       Beauty  In philosophy we discussed how the sopist movement in Greece has similarities to the relativism (post modernism) of today and how Plato attempted to put back together what the sophists had torn apart (especially definitions).  Then comes the beautiful part.  Remember how God named everything... how He is what gives meaning and definition?  Well, that all starts so poetically in the first chapters of Genesis and continues (to an end we still anticipate) in the Word mentioned in the first chapter of John.  "God spoke, and God spoke finally with His Son."

      Well, Aiden has gone to Latin, Art & Theology, History of Science, and Philosophy so far.  I am exhausted from trying to anticipate his being hungry so we are going to take a break and only go to Latin and the Book of the Semester today.  Josh and Ryan are able to make it to all the classes and we find ourselves winding up for the end of the semester.  Papers are comming due and we actually see finals on the horizon.  Meanwhile, there is always time for a good nap as represented by Aiden and Uncle Ryan:    :)  Couldn't resist getting that pic on the internet.    Mom is comming to visit tomorrow evening through Monday evening and I am SO excited!    Yesterday's philosophy class was on Dante's Divine Comedy.  I have never been inspired to read it before, but the teacher described it as a journey of a soul to find God and I find myself wanting to read that hunk of literature.  Perhaps I will try over Christmas.  We are also beginning to make plans for the international rotation that Joshua wants to do hopefully next summer.    Please pray for us in all the things that we are doing right now and hope to do in the future.

      Argh!  Our printer just went *PFT* and stopped working.  It won't turn on... we unplugged it and plugged it back in and knocked on it a few times but it refuses to wake up.  It kinda reminds me of Aiden in the mornings when I am trying to get him to eat.  *laugh*  The more fustrating thing is that I just finished spending $70 canadian for new printer cartridges and I am needing to print off thank you cards for everyone who gave us something or helped in some way with baby stuff.  If you are a part of that group please consider yourself profusely thanked until I can get a card to you saying so.    Meanwhile, I am thinking and praying for the people in our church in Dallas tonight.  It is 6:30 their time and I know that service is comming to a close.  We miss you and pray that God is continuing to show himself to you.  We can't wait to join you for two Saturdays in December.  Thank you for your love and prayers.

      Good Evening World! What a wonderful day.  I gathered up my courage and went out shopping with Aiden and Joshua.  It was a little scary at first because I kept wondering what I would do if he had a screaming session like he had had the evening before.  I, however, needed some new clothes since my maternity ones don't fit anymore (yeah!).  So Michelle, a friend of ours, drove us to the Salvation Army and Josh strolled around with Aiden in the sling while I looked for clothes.    It looks like I am going to get to be flannel momma this winter as I couldn't find anything but flannels that were nursing-friendly.  That's alright though, I am really enjoying nursing and don't mind flannels at all.    We got back home safely with a quiet and contented baby.  What fun!  I know enough to know that I should enjoy days like this to the fullest.  I had a nap, reviewed some Latin with Joshua, and we started the pot roast for dinner.  Then Ryan called to say he wasn't comming home for a while since he was going to see the Matrix.  Well, I know that Joshua would miss that if he thought that I needed him, but it had been such a great day and I have really appreciated his help all week so I reassured him that I would love for him to go and enjoy the movie.  I told him to come back and let me know if it was worth seeing.  If so, then perhaps we will go see it together while visiting in Texas since we may have ready babysitters in our parents.  *grin*  Then I read a comment on our site from Phil that said something about a Rich Mullen's song that has Aiden's name in it.  We didn't know that when we named him but now that we do, I would love to hear the song.  Does anyone know what album it is in? The words are a partial expression of our prayer for Aiden and I would love to learn to sing it to him.  Here's the words for those who are interested:    urlLink  Let Mercy Lead   Goodnight and God bless!

      HI!  Our sweet baby is just 4 days old and are we both learning a lot!  Joshua is the best husband in the world and has been a great support and help.  Here are pics of Josh and Ryan changing a diaper and Joshua with the finished product.  Ryan has been enjoying uncle duty too and doesn't shirk the poopy diapers.  Hopefully I will find time to post more soon.  Until then, good night!

      Today I brought little Aiden on a walk up to the church for everyone to see after the service.  They were quite delighted and amazed at how big he is.  He continues to improve his breastfeeding skills much to mom's encouragement.  We have also been introducing him to our dogs Scruff and Teddy who seem to have taken a bit of a protector roll over him.  They don't know quite what to do when he cries.  Here are a couple of picks.  One of Teddy and Aiden, the other of Uncle Ryan and his nephew.

      A whole day has passed since the birth of my son.  So far he is as cute as ever and sleeps almost constantly (I'm told that this will change quickly).  We had some trouble getting him to latch on for breastfeeding at first because he didn't want to wake up but he now feeds readily.  We actually have to take off all his clothes and rub him with a wet washcloth inorder to get him to wake up enough to eat.  The guy really likes his sleep.  Guess he gets it from his dad.    While Janice was taking a nap today I brought little Aiden on a walk around the block to get him some sunlight.  It is fairly warm here right now so I figure we'll make as much use of it as we can before winter sets in.  It was truely wonderful to walk with my little son in the open air.  Here are a few more pictures of mommy Janiece and uncle Ryan with baby Aiden.

We'll be in Dallas for three weeks if anyone wants to see us.  Hope everyone has a great Christmas!!!  Praise God for the glorious gift of His Son, born as a precious baby boy.  I can't help but think of my own baby boy as I write this.  May God even now be drawing him to live a life in service of Jesus.

      Hey everyone!  Guess we've been pretty bad at posting (having a baby around may have contributed just a tad) so I'll try and fill you in on what's been going on.  We enjoyed having Janiece's mom here and were sad to see her go.  On the other hand, Jennifer was able to fly up this weekend and we've enjoyed getting to catch up with her.  Aiden has enjoyed getting to meet his Aunt Jennifer.     Just before these photo's, Aiden showed his appreciation for his aunt by baptizing her with a tummy full of milk!  As we near the end of the semester we are feeling the crunch of papers and review.  In art I am writing a paper exploring the changing view of the human body from early Christian art into the Renaissance.  Particulary I'm looking at Michelangelo and his struggle between the use of the human form to communicate spiritual truths and the rediscovered Greek and Roman ideas of worshipping the beauty of the naked human body.  I chose to look into this topic because it seemed a relevant issue to doctors who daily work with people's bodies, often without any thought to the ultimate purposes for which they work.  I'm also beginning work on my Philosophy term paper which is to explore the nature of evil in Augustine's Confessions.  I'm thinking about using some of C.S.Lewis' ideas to bounce Augustine's off of but time may constrict me from doing this fully.  We just had our first real snowfall!  After a thanksgiving dinner at school last night all of the guys went out and had fun pelting each other with snowballs.  We also found a steep hill nearby and sledded down it on whatever we could find.  I'm afraid there are a few cookie sheets that will never recover fully.  Here is a picture of our dogs enjoying the snow.    When Jennifer came up she brought a gift from the Barnes family in Bryan, TX.  They wanted to make sure Aiden was well equipped for any future hunting expeditions.  It's a little big now but at the rate he's going it should fit any time now.  Maybe he can wear it when I go hunting with Janiece's dad this Christmas break.  Thank you Barnes family!

      We just watched the movie "Seabiscuit" with Tobey Maguire and I would highly recommend it.  As well as being an intriguing story complete with good acting I enjoyed the episodic nature of the movie.  It didn't feel like the director was desperate to keep our attention but rather that he was enjoying the telling of a story.  I think stories, like life should be more episodic and not the swiftly moving rollercoasters that Hollywood is so fond of.  I'm currently researching for one of our Science&Medicine papers which involves the topic of irreducible complexity.  If anyone is interested the book to read is "Darwin's Black Box" by Behe.  Behe is a biochemist who in his book considers possible difficulties facing the current theory of macroevolution from the direction of the growing developments in biochemistry.  Basically, he says that the theory Darwin proposed fit the knowledge of living organisms in his day, however, now that we know the biochemical complexity of the cell (something Darwin understood to be composed of a homogeneous material) the theory of evolutionary origins of life no longer fits the picture.  While I'm not convinced that this idea should be used as a proof of God's existence, as I'm sure many are already doing, it does suggest to me some beneficial ways for Christians to look at ideas of personhood.  I'm still working out my thoughts on that but I'll expand on it when my ideas solidfy more.

      Yesterday our philosophy professor talked about phenamenology.  Sorry about the spelling.  I think he was trying to show his personal approach to "sharing his faith."  He got his doctrite in Germany and I think he is around a lot of philosophy-heads  so his approach is different.  He started out by talking about faith as found in Hebrews 11 can actually be translated into "faithfullness" or "loyality" and that the faith discussed in that chapter does not have anything to do with belief but more to do with a way of life... being faithful to how God told us to live.  Interesting.    So he sees "intellectual" discussion about religion as basically unfruitful.  In large, probably, because he can see through all the intellectual twists one might do to argue for their faith.  He witnesses by living in such a way that he is faithful to what God told him to do.  He proposed that instead of trying to out-argue the other person he would, after some discussion and remaining interest, encourage the other person to "try on" Christianity for a month.  Basically he would see if they would like to live as Christ directs in the New Testament and then see if they thought this was a good way to live.  Good having the emphasis here because he describes God as the ultimate Good and sees us as gravitating to that Good.  He then went on to say that the faith and works were pretty much  inseperable (especially if having faith means living faithfully the way God told you to live) and that if someone started out living faithfully to the NT way of life then eventually their heart and intellect would follow.    What do you think?

      Hello! Looks like our comments have quit working.  We will try and fix it because we love hearing from you guys that check out our blog.    I have been thinking a lot about trusting God lately and what that means.  This may be a silly example: I would like to have another baby while we are in Dallas (there are several reasons behind this).  Sure, I can say that I trust God but can I really sit child-like waiting for Him to make things happen in the right time so that He can help us make the family He would like us to have?  I find myself counting off nine months trying to figure out what would be best.    There are other examples too... too personal to share here.  I am also praying for Joy.  Not that it isn't there... but my attitude is not there.  Yesterday God was so real the prayers flowed and it was great conversation.  It's been a while since that has happened and I miss it.    Looks like we will be going to Thailand for 3 months this summer.  I will be able to work a little bit in a near-by hospital catching babies.  I wonder what Thai birth customs are?  More than that, I want to help others there see who Jesus is.  I just pray that God puts me in the right place.  In preparation for the above Aiden is beginning his vaccanations today.    Funny how things don't always turn out like you planned.

      Aiden is now over two and one-half months old.  His head control has improved to the point where he can hold himself up straight in our laps or in the sling.  Here's a couple of fun pictures with Aiden and me.     He has also begun responding to some of the rattle toys if we shake them for him.  He turns his head and looks at them.  Here's a picture of him "holding" one of his toys.   Actually he will hold just about anything for a bit if you just close his hand around it.

      On the reading of two books:  I am currently in the middle of two very different books.  One is called “Jude the Obscure” by Thomas Hardy.  It was written in 1895 and follows a poor man who’s dreams of going to university are not realized, ends up marrying a woman because she pretends to be pregnant, falls in love with his unhappily married cousin and between them (he and his cousin) they bear children and are despised by the people around them.  It is, in part, an exploration of the depths to which a person can descend and the prejudices that abound.  The other book I am reading is “Saint Francis of Assisi” written by G.K. Chesterton.  It is Chesterton’s writings about a man who was intensely in love with Christ.  Saint Francis took God seriously and as a result did not take himself seriously.  He did many things that the people around him did not understand with the purpose of bringing God’s children back to Himself.  One book explores depths and the other explores heights.  (As a side, I think it is ironic that the “higher” book is about a man who was incredibly humble and intent on lowering himself before God and man while the “lower” book is about a man who intended to raise himself to another social stature and ended up drowning in mire.)  The first book by Hardy impresses upon me the despair that a person can bring upon himself through his fallen nature.  The second book is not only uplifting but encourages me to imagine what my life would look like if I truly loved Jesus like He calls us to love Him.    I must ask myself what is the best expenditure of the time I have been given.  For while the depths can be informative, I find myself concerned about what encourages me to produce fruit and develop character.  As a mother of a little one, I want him to see me seeking to know God in all that I do.  Do not misunderstand me; I do not want to be isolated from the pain that exists.  I refer again to St. Francis who lived in the midst of the pain of a leper colony in abject poverty.  I want to see this pain the way God sees it; knowing that He would not have it this way and he has left His servants here to bind the wounds with Christ’s grave cloths so that He can work His miracle of healing.     Some would say that you must know of that pain before you can heal it and that is why we need to know works like Hardy’s.  I don’t disagree and that is why I haven’t quit the reading of “Jude,” but when I think about what to make the primary focus of my reading I want it to be “whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable” and all things excellent and praiseworthy.

      HI! We are reading Hume right now for philosophy.  Is anyone familiar with him?  It has been a struggle to get through some of his stuff and if anyone has any hints or overviews that would be great.

      So... The temp here is -24C.  Which means it is -11F!  Which means it is really cold outside.  Luckily we are warm and cozy in our basement apartment.  The weather site says it "feels like" -33C. Which converts to -27F.  This certainly ain't Texas :)  Hope all you guys in Texas are staying warm too!

      Here's a picture of Aiden's new bed.  It hangs from a metal frame and bounces when he moves.  It's nice because if he starts to wake up his movement rocks the bed and puts him back to sleep.   And here are a couple pics of Aiden watching the mobile that his Greatgrandmother made.

      Looks like Janiece beat me to the post.  We had a very enjoyable Christmas break and Aiden loved being introduced to his many relatives back home in Dallas-FortWorth.  His grandparents were delighted with the time they had with their grandson.  He was in someone's arms constantly and barely had to lay down by himself for the entire three weeks.  I'm afraid we may have to wean him from the need to be constantly held :)  Maybe I should invest in some earplugs now!  Today we started back up at school with Latin class.  As well as continuing to work through Weelock's Latin text we're now going to start translating pieces from the Latin Bible.  I still remember much of the material despite not studying over the break; however, we're still looking at a good bit of review inorder to catch back up for this semester.

      We're Back! Whew!  After a whirl-wind three weeks visiting all that we love in Texas we are back to our home in Canada.  We even got an airline-sponsored night's stay in Pittsburgh which gave us a chance to relax.  So far we have discovered that we need to get used to waking up to an alarm again, Aiden loves his new bed, and our feet need footies to keep from freezing on our tile floor.  (I will be knitting some slippers in the upcomming days)  I will miss our family and friends back home but I am excited about working our way back into some sort of schedule.  Of course, we are the Loyds and that means that the word schedule can be taken very loosely.    Oh, just a thought, if anyone knows of someone who is getting rid of or selling a TV set that is around 27 inches let me know!  My parent's TV still projects a picture but it is fading fast and I would love to find a way to replace it.    Hello to anyone who is still reading our blog nearly a month after our last post!   We love ya'!

      Wow!  I just checked the blog and realized it has been over a week since our last entry.  It's been crazy around here and I've barely had time to think much less blog or write the support letter that is far overdue.  Last week was our spring break.  They actually call it "reading week" which I thought was a joke until it hit me how much work we have left to do in such a short time.  Our plans to travel and see some of Canada were dropped and we spent the week working on our science papers.    We didn't spend the entire week working.  On wednesday we got together with a few of the students who didn't leave for the break and taught some Country dancing lessons.  One of the guys does some Salsa dancing and we did a little of that too.  Then on Thursday we went to the Museum of Civilization where the Dead Sea scrolls were showing.  I think this is the first time they've been traveling out of Israel since they were discovered.  The exhibit was quite impressive and also included many artifacts from biblical times.  While we were in Quebec visiting the museum we went to a seasonal event called Winter Lude.  Every year they take the large amounts of snow which fall and build a park.  It is full of icescultures and buildings.  In addition they had huge iceslides like something from wet'n wild except frozen.  You can build up alot of speed coming down those slides.       Here are a couple of scupltures from inside the igloo.  Hey Al and Aaron, how would you like to have that one on your wall?!!

      Salvete!  Joshua and Janiece are out on their Valentine's date.  They went the day after Valentine's day to avoid the crowds.  So Uncle Ryan is here spending some quality time with his cute little nephew.  I am not sure how good of a job I am doing as I never know if he is hungry, sleepy, or just feeling grouchy ;)  But am hanging in there and have finally gotten him off to sleep.  Hopefully he was full and won't wake Janiece up tonight wanting an extra snack.  Need to have a little tyke of my own some day, but I am missing a few key prerequisites such as a wife.  Oh well, back to writing papers.  Valete.

      Reading....  "If one no longer considers childbearing part of the nature of the sexual act, and if married heterosexuals claim childless sex as a 'right' -they have and the Supreme Court long ago upheld it- then it is difficult to deny this 'right' to those whose sexual acts always preclude children- that is, homesexuals" --Patrick Fagan

      I'm currently working on my Science, Medicine and Faith paper and thought I'd take a break and blog.  The paper is on "irreducible complexity" the latest of the challenges to Darwinism.  Michael Behe wrote a book in 1996 called "Darwin's Black Box" which brought up challenges to the theory of evolution of species based on current discoveries in biochemistry.  He proposed that the intricate machinery of the cell is irreducibly complex and could not have been created by random mutation and natural selection.    Right now I'm looking into the possible extension of this idea to the metaphysical realm.  An article suggested to me by Dr. Patrick is "The Revenge of Conscience" by J. Budiziszewski; he is a professor of Government and Philosophy at The University of Texas.  He addresses the nature of the conscience of man as an active force.  He asserts that the conscience is a part of God's general revelation to men that he has written on our hearts to tell us what is right and wrong.  The conscience initially acts as a deterent when we will to sin.  When we sin despite the warning of our conscience, however, that very same part of us turns on us and drives us further into sin.  The only way to correct this malfunction is by confession, atonement, reconcilliation and justification.  I'm not sure if the compexities of our human natures can be fit into an idea of irreducible complexity.  Darwinism has only effectively proposed mechanisms for the development of material phenomena.  In order to demonstrate the inablility of natural selection to produce personhood we would first need an understanding of the way metaphysical self and material self are related.  The irreducible complexity arguement may not be appropriate to address the shortfalls of Darwinism on a metaphysical level.  This very inability, however, points to the fact that it remains necessary to recognize the inablility of our understanding of our bodies to explain the intricacies of our metaphysical selves.  I'm just musing on the screen so I appologize if that didn't make sense.  On a different note here are a few more pictures of Aiden.

      Well, here we are... Friday night. :)  It has been a long week but Aiden and I are becomming more and more familiar with nap routines!  The great thing about that is that he cries less when I put him down for a nap.  We've also started reading the Bible to him at night.  I know he doesn't understand it, but he will probably begin to understand what we say much sooner than we think.  Anyway, it is good for me to read from the Bible outloud since it helps me to understand it better.  We are reading through Romans and Judges.  *grin* anyone else see the fun contrast in that?  Today we read the story about the judge who walked past the pagan idols, stuck a sword into the king so far that his fat engulfed the sword handle, and walked back out past the pagan idols.  Those poor idols were powerless!

      We recently bought some puzzle mats so that Aiden can lay on the floor.  Our floor is tile and can become rather cold so this allows him to learn to move around on his tummy without laying directly on the floor.  So far he can occasionaly roll over and turn in circles if he is really excited.  The dogs also like to lay down with him.

      Last night our college hosted an event in cooperation with Redeemer College, a local Christian university.  It was a lecture addressing the "dangers" of literature.  There were two speakers.  One was Richard Sembera, our philosophy teacher, and the other was Deborah Bowen, a literature professor from Redeemer college.  The intriguing thing about the evening was the strikingly different worldviews of the two professors.  Dr. Sembera, while not strictly modern in his ideas on truth, is very modern in his methodology.  Dr. Bowen, on the other hand, calls herself a moderate postmodernist.  (I asked her about that afterwards and I think the only reason she uses the term moderate is that she is a Christian)    Dr. Sembera used a rigourously logical style of axiomatic deduction and Socratic inquiry to explore the idea that great literature (or any art form) is inspired in some way by forces of the spiritual realm.  On the other hand Dr. Bowen addressed the idea that the "danger" in literature might be the ability of that forum to change the reader.  Literature, she proposed, is an incarnation of another person's self and worldview.  When we engage with that incarnation and identify within ourselves the same essential humanity, beautiful, frail, fallen, we can't help but be changed.  The crowd was probably more modern than postmodern (at least in education) and I think some of Dr. Bowen's ideas may have been a little stretching.  Some were particularly uncomfortable with Dr. Bowen's proposition that we cannot know truth in the sense that much modern thought claims we can.  This was particularly interesting in that Dr. Sembera came to basically the same conclusion.    Propbably the most striking difference between the two speakers was the dressing of the arguements.  One was a systematic, logical discourse while the other was the flowing narrative of a story.

      Well, this weekend Aiden got used to being held 100% of the time.  Result?  He is having a hard time getting used to not being held.  That's okay though, he still looks like an angel when he sleeps!

      This weekend was incredible, amazing.  I want to tell you about it but I am really, really tired.  Aiden was magnificant.  I was able to attend all the sessions and evening activities with him in our didymos sling.  He is exhausted also and spending lots of time sleeping today.  Keep checking, if you are curious as to what we have learned, and we will post some stuff in the upcomming days as we recover.  I miss all of you in Texas but I am more certain then ever that this is where God wants us right now.    Blessings, Janiece

      The Sound of Hope conference began yesterday.  Jeremy Begbie is leading it and so far he has given us quite a bit to think about.  He is a theologian and concert pianist from Oxford who is in charge of a project called "Theology through the arts".    Dr. Begbie said there are two different interactions between theology and the arts.  One is theology of the arts, the commentary of theology on the arts.  What does the our understanding of the gospel say about the art we do?  The second is theology through the arts.  What can the arts add to our understanding of the gospel?  An example he gave is the doctrine of the trinity.  Three in one.  How do we think about that?  How can we express it in words?  It is quite challenging.  But what about music?  Can we express the idea of three in one in music? (At this point he played a three-note chord on the piano)  It's really quite easy.  Another thing he talked about is the nature of creating art.  If you start off with all your ideas and just set down to try and express them in art, then your art is restricted to what you already understand.  The creative process, however, is more akin to exploration than exposition.  Anyone familiar with J.R.R. Tolkein's work may know that he approached his writting as an act of discovery.  He gave tremendous respect to the worlds he created in his mythology.  As such his stories are able to embody the gospel in ways he probably never directly planned or intentioned.

      Hi!  This weekend is a VERY packed seminar series that the college set up for the students (and anyone else who was interested).  We are going to be doing a number of lectures, recitals, worship times with a man named Jeremy Begbie.  The topic?  Well, it is hard to narrow down but could probably be said to be theology and the arts.  If you are interested in what we are doing here is a website:  urlLink www.soundhope.ca    Also, we will try and post short bits on what we learn.  Please pray for us.... that God will speak to us during this weekend.  Not only are we slower than many others when it comes to the arts (the fault of our strictly science background) but we will also be juggling the responsibilities of a baby whose bedtime is 7pm.  Unfortunately there is an event every night after his bedtime... guess we will have a chance to be creative!

      Ok, some people have been asking for pictures... here is one of Aiden.  He will probably not like the fact that we posted this very much when he gets older, but for now he doesn't mind!  We try to give him diaper-free time occasionally to let all that skin dry.   He will be 5 months old next week!

      Some may say that it is too early to begin to think about how we would like to educate our child(ren).  I could excuse myself by saying that it is because we are so involved in the education that we are receiving right now that we can't help but think of ways we would like to pass it on to Aiden and the others.  I think many parts of Augustine College have woken us up to a mental ideal of what we would like to provide for our children, but I also feel like God himself is urging us on to uncover how we will do this.  Anyway, all thinking about thoughts aside, Josh and I have been looking more and more at classical homeschooling stuff.  All of a sudden I am looking at Aiden wondering when he will be able to learn to read, count, and speak Hebrew.  *laugh*  Then I stop and have a reality check.  As exciting as it seems at this point to teach our little man "important stuff" like how to read sometime in the future, it could be that he is learning some of the most important stuff right now.  For example, he is learning about relationships between other people, relationships between a husband and a wife, relationships between someone and God.  He is mostly learning all of this by watching his parents (Josh and I).  Then I realize how important it is that I behave rightly so my little boy will learn rightly.  Then I am convicted and pray for regeneration.

      Too long since last post.... Too much has happened...  Josh, Aiden, and I are all still here in Canada enjoying and learning.  We continually feel blessed and are excited as things wrap up and we get ready to head home.  Ryan went home to Dallas today.  We are really going to miss him here and it has been good to see him learn and grow this year.  If you read this, please join us in praying that God will help him to assimilate everything he learned this year and that God will be preparing Ryan for the ministry He has planned in Thailand and the rest of Fourth Year.     I found the following article:  urlLink Blogitelling  about blogging.  I think this is the main reason that I havn't blogged as much as I would like to.  When you get to sharing what you REALLY think on the internet there seems to be too many factors that you can't control so that makes me cut back in what I post.  The particular thing that I can't control is how people will interperet what I say and I am not there with them as they read it to explain myself further.  Even more than my desire to not misrepresent myself is my desire to not misrepresent my Saviour.    Ok, and to share a particularly sweet moment with you all....  This evening Josh was reading Scripture to Aiden and I.  I was holding Aiden in my lap and for a portion of the reading Aiden practiced his balance in sitting up.  As Josh continued to read, Aiden looked up and stared at his Daddy's face.  I watched Aiden's face as he responded to the inflections in Josh's voice.  Sometimes Aiden would give a tiny smile, sometimes his forehead would wrinkle.  The whole time I prayed that God would pour Himself and His Word into Aiden's heart.  I hope our son will always love God, love His Word, and love His people.

We are busy wrapping things up and making sure that, at the same time, things are taken care of back in Dallas so that Josh will have no probs when he goes back to school.  Transition is SO crazy... if anyone has any hints on how to keep the house clean while you are preparing to turn your world upside down, let me know!

      Only two weeks left!  It really feels like home here in Ottawa and I will miss the people we have come to love.  I can't believe that this 'chapter' is almost over.  I remember last year at this time we were still newly pregnant and wondering if we were really going to be able to come at all.  Last night Josh and I thumbed through some pictures and it was nice thinking about all that has taken place while we have been married.    This year we are looking forward to Thailand, wondering how we will live in a 1-room apartment for 10 months, and eager to find out what residency we will eventually go to.  Life is so exciting!  I must admit I sometimes long for a little calm, but it seems like we have been given the energy we need to keep up with it all.  Great news!  My hubby finished his last paper...    urlLink Irreducible Complexity   I am SO proud of him!    Perhaps one day he will write a book!

      Today is Sunday.  Josh has a bit more to go on one of his papers and he needs to finish it today since next week is full.  Josh was voted valedictorian so he (we) needs to work on a speech at some point *grin*  I need to finish up laundry, vacuuming, knitting the soaker I am working on, tidying up a bit.  Need, need, need.... But I WANT to have a day of rest.  I've heard that God doesn't always supply your wants but he will supply your needs.   I pray today he does just the opposite.

      I'm thinking alot about how to incorporate arts in my worship and church community.  I love drama... I wonder if anyone else at LGBC would be interested in doing little skits?    What about visual art?  That's not really my forte, but if I were to express my worship with paint then what would it look like?    What about dancing as worship during church?  Well... I'm still a little *achem* inhibited for that.  I'm not closed to it though.    I was looking at  urlLink Hope Chapel  in Austin.  It seems like a "normal church" that is very vibrant and alive.  Want to know what makes them a bit unique?  They have an arts ministry team.  Imagine your church having an arts minister.  (I am trying to imagine what that would have looked like in the large church I grew up in)  The church itself has an arts gallery, Supports a Christian Artist for a year so they can develop their art, and the church really explores how to tie links between artists and the greater Christian community.  Cool stuff.

      ok,ok... I know we havn't blogged in a long time and as cute as Aiden is it is time for something different huh?  Lately Josh has been writing and writing... he has 1/2 a paper to go but here is what he has written so far:   urlLink MathematicsPaper "The Languages of Man"    urlLink Philosophy "An Inquiry concerning Hume's Understanding"    urlLink ScripturesPaper "On Salvation"    urlLink History of Chemistry.doc    urlLink Rembrandt.doc    urlLink Mozart.doc   One of the reasons we came here was so that Josh could become better at writing!  He has certainly had many oppertunities for that.  When he finishes his last paper on irreducibility we will post it too.    Today is Easter Monday, a holiday I never heard about it Texas, but it is celebrated here in Canada.  Josh, Aiden and I took a long walk and visited several book stores.  I found some books for Aiden and I can't wait for him to wake up from his nap so I can read them to him!!!  Josh is studying for his art exam while listening to Bach so he can also be prepared for his music exam.  This week is individual class finals and next week is the oral and written comprehensive (all of the courses for the whole year) exams.  We are preparing for Thailand mentally at least and I am knitting soakers like a mad woman.    Anyone know anybody who lives in Evansville Indiana?  A residency that is there has caught our eye and we are interested in knowing more about the area.    and for all of those [grandparents] who are eager to get another look at Aiden... here you go:      Here's Aiden with his Grandparents.     Here's Aiden doing two of his favorite things.. playing in his Jumperoo (sure it's bulky but he sure likes it!) and chewing on the table.   Here's Aiden himself.

      We had our first day in the Chiangklang clinic today.  Most of the patients were very similar to what one would see working in the US.  The most common problem seems to be gastritis, perhaps related to the very spicy diet.  We also saw lots of back pain, headaches, and respiratory illnesses.    We did see a couple unusual things.  One twenty-year-old man was brought in ten days after a motorcycle accident.  He had been seen in a local Thai hospital and sent home a few days later since his vital signs were stable however he remained partially blind in one eye, was unable to  stand because of ataxia, and had trouble urinating.  All this points to increased intracranial pressure likely due to a subdural hematoma.  However, the Thai hospital does not have a CT scanner and he would have had to been sent to Bankok the day of the accident to be imaged and have the blood drained out of his skull.  That would have required alot of money that he didn't have.  In the US he would have had surgery immediately after the accident and would likely be walking around today but the best we were able to do for him was set him up with physical therapy.  We were able to pray with him and answer his questions about what sort of recovery to expect.  I also got to do a thoracentesis (sp?) on a guy who had pheumonia and whose entire left lung was full of fluid.  We pulled off almost a liter of fluid before it solidified and he permanently lost use of that lung.  Got to get back to my Thai study!

      Thai people LOVE children.  Which translates into Adien being loved on and carried around by all the workers here.  :)   Meanwhile I am trying to learn some of the language.  I know I sound like a child but I just don't want to sound like a fool.    Aiden and I went swimming this morning and Aiden learned to splash with his hands.

      We made it to Bangkok!  We are here one more night and then we take a one hour flight to the Nan province where we will meet up with Dr. Ashburn who will then take us to the clinic.  The flight was good and I am very glad it is over.  Fifteen hours in an airplane is a long time!  We asked for some seats in front of the bassinet tray which meant that after we had taken off, the flight attendant brought a baby bassinet out and strapped it to the tray.  What a help!  Aiden played in the bassinet and even slept in it which gave our tired arms a rest.  Proof of Thailand's heat and humidity was literally "in front of our faces" when the moment we stepped out of the airport and our glasses promptly fogged up.    We are adjusting to the time change (12 hours ahead of Dallas time) so Aiden woke up at 1 am ready to play.  Today we are going to try and see some of Bangkok.  One of our companions on the flight recommended we eat everything we find as the food here is very good!  We will let you know how it goes.  Until then, take care.  Thank you for your prayers covering our journey.  PS Having a baby while you travel is a great advantage when there is a line to stand in.  An official comes up and quickly takes you to a line that has no one in it.  At customs here in Thailand the official put us in the Thai passport-holder line and made us cut in front of the Thai businessmen.  We were embarrassed, but it did make the process shorter.

      We fly away in about 3 hours or so.  Wow... what a month!  We should begin blogging more consistantly when we get to Thailand and can work a little routine into our lives.  To everyone we didn't get to see: We look forward to seeing you this fall.  Please pray for us in this new venture.  love, Janiece

      We're back in Dallas!  Ryan, Janiece's dad, and I arrived via truck towing U-haul on Monday.  Janiece and Aiden flew in by plane last Saturday.  We'll be here a couple weeks, minus a trip to Louisiana next week.  Then we travel down to College Station for Jennifer's wedding!  WHOOP!!!  Not a week after the wedding we'll be boarding a plane for Thailand.  For three months Ryan and I will be working in a missionary clinic in norhtern Thailand treating the Hill Tribes people.  We are looking forward to the opportunity since we all want to go overseas as long-term missionaries after our medical training is complete.  In other news... Aiden is beginning to scoot around on the ground (wouldn't really call it crawling yet) and he rolls over quite proficiently.  He still doesn't seem interested in sitting though.  He would rather straighten out and try to stand up than sit.  We are hoping he hasn't inherited his dad's inflexibility, which made all of those fun activities sitting around on the floor in elementary school pure torture :)

      HI! Just wanted to add to Ryan's post (thanks Ryan for posting!):  The little hat on the baby is a part of the traditional mien costume.  When we got there quite a few women were wearing their traditional clothing (black turban on the head, black shirt with red muff around the collar, and pants with hand-embroidered design) and carrying their babies in mien baby-carriers.  Embroidering is a means of family identity and income for these ladies and so getting new glasses so they could see to sew was a big deal!  We didn't get a picture, but one of the missionaries said that later that day she saw a long line of older mien ladies sitting beside the little road sewing together.

      Saturday we went on a mobile clinic to a Mien village in the mountains about four hours from Chiangklang.  We had to drive up and down many winding mountain roads to get there but luckily the roads were paved and in fair condition (all except the section where one of the two lanes had been washed into a ravine ;)  It was the home village of a woman named Saing who runs the lab at the clinic.  She became a Christian at a Christian run boarding house for Mien children whose villages are too far away from the public school.  Later she went to college majoring in medical technologies after which she intended to get a high paying job in a large city like Bangkok.  That way she could send money home to her parents to honor them and make them happy.  Saing had come and visited the missionary clinic in Chiangklang during college.  She liked what they were doing but wasn't interested in working there because it was in a small town and consequently didn't pay much.  The year before Saing graduated her family came into some money yet they continued to have even more problems than before.  She realized then that her becoming rich and important in a big city and sending them lots of money would never bring her parents true happiness; only by coming to know Jesus as she had would her family find happiness.  So she came to work in Chiangklang where she could use her degree and yet be close enough to her family's village to visit and witness to them.  A mobile clinic typically visits a village for one day and attempts to do as much quick fix and relief medicine as possible in limited time with limited medicine and supplies.  Doctors are unable to do much about chronic illness and any emergent surgical needs must be referred to the nearest hospital many hours away.  We are able to give out antibiotics for infections and antiparasitics for worms.  We can give out anti-inflammatories, pain meds, and physical therapy exercises for the aches and pains of a farming lifestyle.  We also can bring glasses for all the old women to be able to see their sewing.  The goal of the mobile clinic is to show Christ's love to the people of a village by meeting some of their physical needs.  This will hopefully open up their hearts to the Gospel so that God can meet their spiritual needs as well.  The day before some Mien Christians went to the Saing's village to start talking to people and get spiritual conversations going.  Then on Saturday we went in and held the medical clinic.  The Mien Christians and some of the missionaries stayed around after we left for a few days to continue talking with people and to pursue relationships with those who showed interest in learning more about Jesus.  All three of us were able to attend since Mary Ashburn, the wife of the doctor we are working with, offered to watch Aiden for Janiece all of Saturday.  This was quite a blessing! (although Janiece and Joshua were quite eager to see their baby once again by the end of the day)  Joshua and I each worked with a translator and saw patients while Dr. Ashburn cycled around supervising and helping us when our diagnostic skills faultered.  We ended up seeing about one hundred patients in all as well as giving out lots of pairs of glasses to the older folk.  Meanwhile Janiece, the Ashburn's kids, and some of the summer IMB student missionaries had activities and Bible puppet shows for the village children while the Mien evangelists spoke with the interested adults about Jesus.  All in all it was quite an experience.  Please pray that the seeds of love we planted will find fertile soil in the people's hearts and that God's Spirit will move in Saing's village and family.

      Howdy!  This past Wednesday I went with some of the Thai Christians to a village a couple hours away from the clinic.  The village is a resettlement area where the Thai government moved many of the Hill Tribes people from near the border with Laos back in the seventies.  They were worried about Communist ideas influencing these people and wanted to integrate them better into mainstream Thai society as well as keep an eye on them.  There are Hmong, Lahu, and Mien people living there.  The Hmong people have a large community of believers and a church of about 100 but there are only a few Christian women among the Mien and no church.  I went with some of the Mien Christians who work at the clinic to visit a couple of the older Mien widows, worship with them, and also sign them up for a charity that Thai Christians have organized to take care of elderly widows.  The second widow we visited was the sweetest little woman, probably in her seventies or eighties, who weaves and sews Mien cloth for a living.  She had these huge glasses on to see her sewing and she had wrapped a piece of twine around the bridge of her glasses and tied it behind her head.  She explained that this was because Mien women don't have those nice large nasal bridges for holding up glasses that we westerners do.  I definitely need to get my hands on some pictures one of the other missionaries took and post them!  While we were at her house she invited over a younger woman to whom she had been witnessing and who was interested in becoming a Christian.  The other woman explained that she had lots of problems in her life, a drunk husband among them, and she had noticed that the Christian widow seemed impervious to the attacks of evil spirits (something the Hill Tribes believe in and fear).  During this conversation the little old widow sat smilling, hunched over her sewing with those huge coke bottle glasses suspended by twine above her nose, occasionally piping in with some cheerful comment and I have to admit she looked fairly well unassailable by evil spirits.  The younger woman had talked to her husband and he had no objection to her becoming a Christian just so long as he didn't have to.  This was quite a blessing as many women are forbidden from becoming Christians by their family and if they do they are kept from gathering with other believers.  After the Mien Christians talked with her awhile and answered some of her questions about who God is and who Jesus is the woman decided to become a Christian.  We all prayed with her, sang some songs of praise, and welcomed her into Christ's family.  It was quite a cool experience.  I hope to get some pictures of it up some time soon.

      I gave Janiece a bit of a break from Aiden this evening and she went into town to visit the weavers.  They had all kinds of cool fabrics and clothing to choose from.  Janiece bought a beautiful Thai skirt and then modeled for me upon her return.  Isn't she just gorgeous!!!

      Everything is going well here.  I just have the blogger-blaahs.    Today we found out that kissing on the mouth, even a light hello-peck, is an embarassing/gross idea to the Thais.  Our language instructor said that the first time she saw a video of an American wedding she covered her eyes when she saw the kiss.  Kissing on the face, the nose, or touching noses seems to be the way to kiss when you are here.  :)  Apparently even married couples don't usually kiss on the mouth in the privacy of their own homes.  Kinda different huh?    I think that I am refining my ideas of how to be a missionary.  I used to think that it would be easy to just adopt the ways of the people around me but it really isn't practical or possible.  First of all, if you are the only Christian doing work in a non-Christian population then you will obviously do things differently then the people around you.  Second of all, no matter what, I am a product of the culture I was born into and I can not just come here to Thailand and wipe everything I learned away.  No matter what I attempt to do I do not think that the people here could see us as one of them.  Farangs (their word for foreigners) stand out in a crowd because of their white skin and taller stature.  Even walking down a street the little kids playing in front of their houses stop and point at us.  I am so used to being in a multi-cultural society that it is different to be among such a homogenous culture and realize how much I stick out.  I guess we will just pray that God will use us as a vessel so that His Word can be introduced to this culture despite the fact that we are not a part of this culture.

      Yesterday a summer missions team of college students arrived here at the dorm.  There are four girls; two of them will be doing drama ministry here at the clinic and two will be teaching english at one of the tribal boarding homes nearby.  The boarding homes are places where kids of the Hill Tribes people can come stay while they go to school in town.  The education available in the Tribal areas is very basic and families must send their kids into town in order for them to progress further than the early elementary grades.  The couples who run the homes are all Hill Tribe Christians who raise the children while they are here, tutor them in their school subjects, and teach them from the Bible.  This is an amazing opportunity for upcoming generations of Tribal peoples to hear the Word.    After church today we all came back to the dorm for a wonderful dinner of leftovers.  It was a great chance to hang out with the newcomers and share food and fellowship.

      Today I left Aiden with Joshua and joined a team of people in traveling to a Mien village.  We traveled for about 45 minutes on a normal Thai road and then for about 25 minutes on a twisty-turning-up-and-down road.  I must stop here and share with you about Thai roads.  They do drive British-style so you drive on the left side of the road.  To a person who grew up in the US the road looks like it has only two lanes, one going one way and the other going the other way.  The truth of the matter is that there is actually 4 lanes and occasionally 5 lanes on the road.  The motorbikes travel to the far left, the cars going in the same direction are just to the right of that and then there is some crazy passing action that happens when a car and/or motorbike is going too slow.  Oh, not to mention the dogs, chickens, walkers, bicyclers, and other such traffic sharing the road with you.  Driving is exciting here, thank goodness we are not the ones behind the wheel!  Anyway, I will take you back to that stomach-churning road in my story:  By the end of the trip I was beginning to feel a bit ill and then I found out that the last 4 miles or so had only been paved in the last month!  Wow, I would have been even more queasy if there had not been any pavement.    The reason that we were going to the village was because there are about 6 Christians there and they do not have a church.  The closest church is 10 kilometers away on a very bad unpaved road and the fact that it is the rainy season has made that church fairly inaccessible to these Christians.  We were going to have some worship time with the Christians and encourage them to remain strong.    On the way, we stopped a few times at the Christians' houses to let them know we were there.  It had rained all day today so they were home and ready to meet when we got there.  We walked across a rickety bamboo bridge to get to the house where we were going to meet.  Taking our shoes off at the door, we sat on a plastic mat which covered the cement floor and began to sing worship songs.  I do not, of course, speak Thai much less Mien so I sat and enjoyed the sound of my brother's and sister's worship and prayed for them.    One of the Mien workers from the clinic then told a story from the book of Daniel.  The Old Testament has not yet been translated for the Mien so this team has been trying to tell them stories from the Old Testament with accompanying pictures so that they can understand how God works.    After that we had prayer time.  I found out that the house we were meeting in belongs to a man who had just become a Christian in the last month.  Previous to that he had been involved in drug stuff and so some people were wanting to kill him.  He had been shot and decided that he wanted to follow Jesus.  He asked for prayer since people were still wanting to kill him.  There was also a request from a woman whose husband is a Christian but who is unable to quit drinking alcohol.    After praying together, we asked if anyone at the meeting had any minor medical needs since we had brought a big box of meds from the clinic.  Ryan became the point person for helping to decide who needed what.   These are some prayer requests for this village other than the ones mentioned above that I wanted to share with you:  1. For the Christians' continued growth 2. For their witness to their neighbors 3. For the Old Testament to be translated into their language 4. For some sort of literacy class to be set up so the Christians can read the Bible on their own even when there is not outsiders to bring worship to them.  Thank you for your prayers!

      The Walters left for Bangkok this morning.  We were sad to see them go and will miss there presence, especially the mornings when we all sat around eating breakfast together.  They have invited us to stay with them for the day we are in Bangkok before we fly back to the States in August.

      One of my patients today was a guy in his 20's who was in a serious car accident 5 months ago.  He broke his neck and was hospitalized for a month following surgery.  Since his accident he has been unable to move his legs and regularly loses control of his bladder.  When he asked his doctor about walking again he was simply told to give it a year or so because these things take a while to heal.  He has recieved no physical therapy at all.  I felt really bad telling him that his chances of walking again were small and being able to offer him nothing more than a referal for physical therapy which the local hospital may ignore in the end.  When we were finnished seeing him, however, he thanked me profusely for all of the time we had spent seeing him, listening to him, and talking with him about his medical problems.  He said his other doctors wouldn't explain anything about his care to him and they would never spend more than a minute or so seeing him.  After we had done the little we could, giving him better pain meds and treating a urinary tract infection, I offered to pray for him.  He is Buddist but his eyes lit up and he appreciated the prayer greatly.  The nurse, who acts as my translator and who is a Christian was also able to spend a long time talking with him about our faith and why we are here doing what we are doing.  I pray that this man will continue to learn more about Jesus through the clinic and other Christians placed in his path.

      After a few friendly notices, we changed the comments section on our blog.  We appologize for the difficulty and hope that you will find this easier!    Hope you have a great new week!  Oh, I rode a motor bike to town today to get some baby cereal.  It was very nice to feel the breeze and do something I had never done before.

      So we have been here at the compound (yes, that is what they call it) for two weeks.  Things are pretty good and I think we are adjusting pretty well.  Some things though, will be a challenge this summer.  I think that for me the fact that we have no privacy will be a constant struggle.  We live with Aiden in a little room that is probably 10 by 12 feet and an attached bathroom.  I am thankful that we have our own bathroom and don't have to use the dorm-style ones.  We have big screened-in windows on either side of the room that need to be open all the time since there is no air conditioner.  With the windows open and curtains drawn back, we have airflow and everyone can hear and see us.  With the windows closed we gain a little more privacy (people can still hear us talk, but it isn't quite as easy) but it sure gets stuffy!    This has become a difficult especially with a baby.  The babies here are very well loved and indulged.  When someone has a baby they either hire help or their family moves in to help take care of things.  The result is that the baby never needs to cry and there is always someone to rock the baby to sleep.  That's so cool!  The babies don't seem to suffer from this attention and since there is always someone willing to give it there is never the issue of the baby needing to "learn to put himself to sleep."    The difficulty is that I am coming into this situation from a different culture and will be returning to that same culture in less than 3 months.  I haven't and won't have hired help or extended family living with me to help me do chores and take care of the baby.  I can't spend an hour rocking Aiden to sleep because I will have things to do and I would much rather spend my spare time playing with Aiden than rocking him to sleep.  So I do the only thing I have found to work.  When he is sleepy, I nurse him, love him, kiss him, and lay him in his crib to go to sleep.  Then Aiden screams his head off for about 40 minutes.  I hate it, but if I go rub his back he screams harder and if I pick him up he won't let me lay him back down.  The next day he doesn't scream but he cries for about 15 minutes or so.  The crying periods shorten and finally yesterday and today he goes to sleep with no crying.   The whole time this was happening, however, the Thai women who live here were questioning what I was doing.  That hurt and made me feel intensely lonely.  Faye, the other missionary wife here tried to explain what I was doing with Aiden to them.  She said they were asking why I was torturing Aiden.  Once, when I was standing outside our door waiting to make sure Aiden got to sleep okay a lady came out and asked me why I didn't go comfort him.  Oh if only I could and if only that worked!  (I did have other plans for how I was going to raise my son before he was born.  I was NOT going to ever let him cry it out.  Oh well, *grin* things change.)      So now Aiden goes to sleep wonderfully.  Except this morning he woke up at 3:30 am and wanted to play.  Sorry, no can do.  So he screamed again.  And I lay in bed hating the fact that I have to do this and hating even more the fact that I can feel the disapproval of the people who can hear Aiden, wanting so much to have my own space where I can do what I feel needs to be done and not have to worry about the people around me judging me.    It is not an unbearable situation but it isn't the easiest thing either.  I think I feel the need to share this for several reasons:  1. I don't want our blog to give an unrealistically good impression of what is going on.  Things ARE good and God has blessed us unbelievably, but things are a little difficult at the same time.  2. I don't want to give the impression that I am adjusting perfectly to all the changes that go with living here.  I am a very real person and there will be struggles all summer.  3. I feel disappointed that I am not able to fulfill my pre-baby expectations and I have to let Aiden cry it out.  Hearing what the Thai women said just echoed that disappointment even though I know those expectations are not realistic for me.  Somehow posting this seems to make things better.

      The Walter's boys found the craziest thing crawling around outside their room here.  At first glance it looked like a worm crawling along the ground.  When we looked closer, however, it turned out to be a mass of tiny worms crawling along each other in a coordinated fasion.  Here's some pictures I took of it.  Janiece thinks she may have seen the same thing the other day; however, the one she saw was feet long rather than inches!

      I had an interesting patient yesterday.  A young guy probably in his late twenties came into the clinic with alot of vague symptoms- headache, neck pain, innability to sleep -and after talking to him awhile I asked him if he thought that perhaps all these problems were stemming from a spiritual rather than a physical illness.  He said that he did think that was true.  He told me he has become increasingly worried about what people in his family and at his work think of him.  He said he worked hard in college, majored in physics, and was able to get into a study abroad program in Australia because of his achievements.  Now he helps run two companies in northern Thailand.  He said that he has always been very proud of himself and his achievements, taking pride in his ablity to excell and take care of himself.  Now he worries constantly about possible failure and the ridicule of those around him.  He spoke decent English and both I and the nurse had a long talk with him everyone's need to rely on God, not themselves.  He said he grew up Buddhist but that having gone through a hard sciences degree in university he was very skeptical about any religious claims.  I talked with him awhile about the limitations of science and its inability to give meaning to our lives.  He sounded like his world has been shaken up recently and I encouraged him to look into the claims of Christianity further and think more about his spiritual condition.  He lives nearby so hopefully I will get to interact with him further in the future.

      Two days ago a bunch of Laotions came into the clinic.  Laos is right next door to Thailand but it is a closed country so missionaries are not able to go there.  The Laotions, however, come here for medical treatment.  Cool, huh?  Josh and Ryan commonly pray with their patients (the Bhuddists are quite happy that someone wants to talk to Jesus about their problems) and sometimes have a chance to start a conversation about God.  The language barrier is quite a struggle and it is good that the nurses are Christians and are able to converse freely with the patients after Josh or Ryan start the conversation.  Please pray that we can be witnesses despite the communication problem.  Yes, we are taking Thai lessons, but so far all we can say is : "Hello," "how are you?" "What is your name?" and "Nice to meet you."  That is not really a conversation that can go very far in sharing the Good News with someone.  Just pray that God will still use us.    On another note, I think it is very interesting to notice the things that they do NOT have for babies in the stores here:  Highchairs Playyards Baby Toys Baby food (they do have formula) Cribs (they have bassenets for up to 6 months or so but only the rich people get them) Baby Moniters   They Do have: Walkers (we purchased one for 560 Bhat or about $15 USD) Really nice, thin little shirts that are great for the heat Mosquito screens that you can put around baby when outside Disposable diapers Baby potties that fit Aiden's little bottom   Just an interesting note that provides a glimpse into the culture.

      We have been able to observe much of the local wildlife so far during our stay here.  Here is a scorpion one of the nurses found.  It was alommost as long as Janiece's sandle though, unfortunately, the picture to show scale didn't come out as good.   We also have a variety lizards.  This one, called a tokay, is like a large gecko which makes the craziest sound.   Janiece took this cool picture of one of the kittens.  He thinks he's pretty hot stuff.

      I finally figured out how to get pictures on the computer for posting on the website.  Here is one of Aiden in his new walker.   And here is Ryan standing infront of the dorm we are living in.  Janiece and I live in the first room and Ryan is in the fourth room.  The nurses from the clinic live in the rooms upstairs.

      Aiden and I just woke up from a nice afternoon nap.  The Thai nurses scooped him up and are running around showing him off so I thought I'd drop a blog.  Janiece and Ryan are off on a bike ride to the weekly Tuesday market to see if they can find some hats to keep the sun off or anything else of interest.  Every Tuesday evening, if it hasn't been raining, the local town hosts a large outdoor market.  I'll have to have Janiece and Ryan blog about it when I get back.  Meanwhile I'm going to see if I can get our camera hooked up to this computer to put some pictures up.  So far I've barely had a free minute to do that in.

      We went to the little local church today and worshiped with the Christians there.  We did not understand anything being said, but it was nice to be there with them and take Communion with them.  It was sweltering hot when we started (no AC at the church either) but a storm came in as we were eating the pot-luck lunch and this wonderful breeze blew through.  I think that is what I need in my life right now, a nice cool breeze that refreshes my spirit.  Moving, comming to Thailand, taking care of a teething Aiden, and adjusting to a new culture have all begun to wear on me.  I am tired.  Understand though, I am not discouraged, just tired, and I can tell that I need some refreshment.  I am glad that we will be here about 2 and 1/2 more months.  It is nice to have a little bit of stability.  When we get back to Dallas, that will be another adjustment but I won't try to tackle things before they take place.  I am here, in Thailand and I look forward to what God is going to do.  I am going to be teaching the nurses here some English.  They are able to communicate in broken English, but they want to improve.  Does anyone know good English-teaching games?

      My mom was wondering what a "typical" day for us is like so I thought I would try and share right here:  Josh and I wake up at 6:00am.  (Ryan wakes at 5:00am and goes for a morning swim.) Josh takes a quick shower and I may start laundry if I have diapers or clothes that need cleaning.  There is a washer and drier from the US on the premisis but there are a few fun quirks about them:  Our washer fills up with a very slow trickle (there is no hot water for the washer so everything is washed with cold water) so we grab a hose to fill the washer up faster.  In order to dry clothes, the drier needs gas so you have to turn the gas tank on.  If you forget to turn the gas tank on then you come back in an hour and your clothes are nicely tumbled but not dry.  If it is sunny outside then I hang our things on the line to dry.  The sun really gets the stains out of those cloth diapers!  Aiden usually wakes at about 6:30 and I do my morning things with him (change diaper, play a little, nurse).    I will digress a little here and tell you about our living quarters:  Josh and I have a small-ish bedroom that opens to the outside with an attached bathroom.  There is another building called the "lounge" that has one open room with a couch, chairs, computer desk/computer, small sink, gas stove (remember to turn the gas tank on!), fridge, tables, etc.  Our bedroom does not have air conditioning, just a fan, but the lounge has air conditioning which we use if it is hot outside.  So after Aiden is "good-morning-ed" and Josh is dresed and ready for the day, we go to the lounge.  Ryan is usually in the lounge at this time too and we do a little devotional time together.  We have been reading a little of James and singing a few songs afterward.  By then, another family who is also living here have come into the lounge and we all have breakfast together.    Breakfast is usually toast, cold cereal, fruit (they have some wonderful fruit here!), and chocolate-drink.  Today, though, we had eggs, instant grits, and toast!  Who would have thought we could have a good Southern breakfast right here in Thailand!  Then we clean up from breakfast.  We make sure to sweep and put all reminants of food away since the ants here are quite ambitious and they find any food that is out.    By then it is around 8:20 or so and Josh and Ryan head over to the clinic which is a 3 minute walk away.  Aiden and I put on our swimsuits and go for a morning swim.  The pool is quite nice and we really enjoy our time in it.  Then Aiden and I rinse off in the shower and I put Aiden down for a nap.  During his nap I try and get some Bible reading in, maybe check my e-mail, work a little more on laundry, or do some knitting.  If Aiden gets a good sleep he wakes at around 11.  If he wakes before that it has been because his gums are hurting and I get to spend alot of time paying intense attention to him.  The lady who helps with the cleaning around here (I don't remember her name since the Thai names are different and difficult for me to remember) may come and take Aiden for a little while.     Josh and Ryan get back from the clinic around 12:30 and we have lunch together.  There is a cook who cooks lunch and dinner for us on weekdays (yes, we really feel spoiled!).  Lots of times the meal is yummy Thai food but she also knows how to make some western food.  For instance, yesterday we had fajitas.  It was the cook's first time to make tortillias and she did a good job.  They were a little chewy because she used more oil than the Mexican ladies do but they were still quite good.  Today we had spaghetti!  I am hoping to spend some time with her so I can learn to make some of the tasty Thai dishes she makes.  The afternoons are filled with different activities.  We may go to a hilltribe village to help with Bible studies, study Thai language, or on Fridays, help out with a kid's club type of thing where they try and teach the kids some English, and tell Bible stories.  Before dinner I like to go swimming one more time.  This time I go with Josh so I can have someone help me hold Aiden.  Yesterday, Ryan went on a bike ride with some of the boys and then he played tennis with the nurses.  Josh played basketball after our swim.  For dinner we get yet another wonderful dish from the cook.  Then Aiden goes down for the night and we stay up a little longer talking, reading, and doing various other leisurly things.  We usually take another shower before we go to bed since it is warm and humid here and it is nice to not be too sticky when we go to sleep.  That's our weekday!  We havn't been here over a weekend yet so we will let you know how our weekends are perhaps next Monday.    We love you all, thank you for your prayers.    PS if you want to send us a letter or something you can send it to:  (name) Chiangklang Baptist Clinic PO Box 1 Chiangklang, Nan   55160 Thailand   Just send it via regular mail (not UPS or FedEx) so we don't have to pay any pick-up fees.  I think it takes about 2 weeks if you send it at the regular speed and about 1 week if you pay the extra cost for faster delivery.

      Guess what!  Aiden was screaming something fierce this morning when suddenly Janiece realized that he had a sharp bit of tooth beginning to peak through his lower gums.  Our little boy is getting his teeth!  Its amazing how much easier it is to deal with his crying knowing there is a reason.  With the time change and now the teeth Janiece is feeling a little drawn out so we would appreciate your prayers for encouragement for her.  We just finished playing a game of basketball with the twin sons of one of the doctors here and some of the Thais.  The Asburns are pretty good but I'm afraid my poorly inadequate basketball skills were pushed pretty hard.  The biggest advantage I had was that I'm at least a couple inches taller than all of the Thai players.  Janiece and I took Aiden swimming today in the pool here.  He's becoming more comfortable with the water.  Today Janiece and I would push him through the water between us, dunking his head for just a bit along the way.  Babies have a reflex which causes them to close their mouth and nose the moment they go underwater so we are trying to take advantage of that and teach him to swim.  Some of the Thai nurses were out there and had fun giggling over Aiden while he swam.

      Aiden is napping, the guys are working in the clinic, and I am studying a little bit of Matthew and a little bit of James.  James 1:26-27 talks about what righteousness and religion truly is.  It says that our religion is worthless if we don't carefully watch what we say!  God's idea of a religious person (one who He accepts as "pure and faultless") is one who looks after widows and orphans. I might rephrase this as one who loves and has compassion on those who God loves and has compassion on since there is so much in the Bible about how God watches over the widows and orphans.  The second part of verse 27 is the one that I am trying to get my mind around this morning.  What does it mean to keep from being polluted by the world?  How does this work practically?  I know it can't mean that I should not interact with the world, but it seems that I should interact on a cautious and discerning level since there seems to be some sort of purity that God requires.  I would be interested in knowing how other people work this verse out if anyone has any thoughts.

      You'll have to excuse me if I sound slightly delerious.&nbsp; Aiden decided to wake up at 11:30 last night and really didn't ever go back to bed.&nbsp; If we payed any attention to him he would stop crying momemtarily and try to play with us.&nbsp; Then, the second he realized we wouldn't play with him, he'd start screaming again.&nbsp; Needless to say Janiece and I are quite exhasted.&nbsp; Aiden took a decent morning nap but during his afternoon nap he woke up after 20min and never went back to sleep, though we left him in his crib for one and a half hours.&nbsp; Tonight doesn't look to be very promising.&nbsp; We thought we were just about over the worst of his crying and moodiness because the rest of his second top tooth popped out last night.&nbsp; Alas, I'm afraid he may have taken so long on that lst one that his next bottom teeth are ready to come.&nbsp; It would seem there is no rest to be had for the weary parents.   Monday was interesting at the clinic because Dr. Tom was very sick and couldn't get out of bed.&nbsp; Normally they would have to close down when he is like that but since Ryan and I are here they stayed open.&nbsp; We treated the easier patients ourselves and consulted with Dr. Tom over the phone for the more difficult ones.&nbsp; It was a little difficult but we did alright and no one was killed.&nbsp; It pushed my skills and confidence to have to decide when I thought I knew enough to treat the patients and when I needed help but I learned alot and Dr. Tom said we did very well.&nbsp; Though he's still a little sick Dr. Tom is now well enough and back at the clinic.

      Well, we are off to Chaing Mai for a weekend of acting like tourists!&nbsp; Josh and I are excited about getting a room that is our own (we can talk and no one will hear us!) with air conditioning.&nbsp; Yeah!&nbsp; It has been a fairly normal week.&nbsp; Josh had a girl come in who had been told that the clinic did abortions (providence?) and she was not ready to be a mom.&nbsp; She was about 12 weeks pregnant and still in school.&nbsp; They did an ultrasound and let her watch her little baby kick and move and then Josh explained what happens when they perform an abortion.&nbsp; She was not sure what she wanted to do when her appointment was over.&nbsp; Aiden and I showed up at the clinic as she was leaving and she watched Josh play, laugh, and coo with Aiden.&nbsp; I've been praying for her and her baby this week.&nbsp;   Ok, we will be back in touch with you early next week.&nbsp; I hope you have a good weekend.

      So living in Thailand is pretty inexpensive.&nbsp; I was working on money stuff today to see how our spending was going and I thought I would share how the costs of some things work out here.&nbsp; I can get 10 eggs (they are sold in 10s not 12s) for 23 Bhat which is a little more than 50 cents.&nbsp; The girls picked up 2 bunches of bananas yesterday for less than75 cents.&nbsp; Josh and Ryan get Oreos here for about 1/2 the price in the States.&nbsp; (Although they do say there is&nbsp;a little less filling they were really excited about the Oreos.)&nbsp; I came here with little clothing because I didn't have any summer clothing from my stay in Canada.&nbsp; The plan was to buy clothes when I got here and I havn't been dissappointed.&nbsp; I can get a nice skirt and a matching shirt for under $10.&nbsp; I bought some "around the compound" shirts for about $1 each.&nbsp; Josh and I are planning a get-away for our anniversary and the biggest room at the resort is $25/night.&nbsp; So, as you can imagine, it hasn't been too hard to save our pennies.&nbsp; There have been costs still; about $1,300 for my plane flight, $700 for living costs, laundry (diapers!), and Thai lessons.&nbsp; There have been a few people who have been generous in supporting us financially and I wanted to take this space and this time to say that we are very grateful for your help.&nbsp; :)  Bye for now!

      Ok, it is time for an update.&nbsp; Thanks for checking back even when we don't post for a week!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The English Camp:  Last weekend was the English Camp that we put on for a school group.&nbsp; Thank you for your prayers.&nbsp; Josh and I led 4 different sessions with 22 students each on Saturday.&nbsp; We taught them transportation vocabulary, sentence structure, and pronounciation.&nbsp; We especially had fun teaching them how we hail a taxi in the States.&nbsp; In Thailand, you would stand on a street corner, hold your arm down, and wave your fingers.&nbsp; It is hard to explain but it is a very reserved gesture.&nbsp; The kids had a lot of fun watching my exaggerated demonstration of how to get a Taxi in the States: waving your hands above your head (!) and shouting "TAXI!"&nbsp; At the end of the day the kids had fun skit activities that their teachers had planned and we got to be a part of that by sharing testimonies and a Christian skit.&nbsp; The kids were here as a school group with their teachers and none of them were Christians.&nbsp; They came expressly to learn English and we wanted to do that well and effectively so that they would listen to what we had to say about Jesus.&nbsp; The next day was Sunday and we started off by teaching them "Old McDonald" which they really enjoyed because it became a contest to see if the Thais could make better animal noises than the farangs (foreigners).&nbsp; Ever tried making an elephant noise before?&nbsp; Well, they do a great job!&nbsp; Then we did a big group teaching session on the garden of Eden.&nbsp; Mary (the doc's wife here) made it into a news-report situation and we had sentences written out that they practiced saying.&nbsp; After that we split into smaller groups and led them through reading an easier-English version of Adam and Eve's temptation and sin.&nbsp; We helped them with their pronounciation during that and had translators to help them know what the sentences said in their own language.&nbsp; Then we all met back together and Mary told the story of Jesus emphasizing his death and ressurrection.&nbsp; Again we broke up into small groups and helped the kids read the stories outloud.&nbsp; (If you teach English to adults who don't speak English and would like to know more about the stories click here:  urlLink http://www.chronologicalbiblestorying.com/esl_efl/esl_efl_harthcock_materials.htm )  &nbsp;  After that we all met together and played a tounge twister/try American food relay game.&nbsp; You should have seen their faces when they tried the Mac&amp;Cheese and the Gatoraide (which they thought tasted like pee water)!&nbsp; They did enjoy the deviled eggs and the chocolate pudding!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  At the end of the camp the kids were all very thankful and expressed a desire to have another camp in October or next summer (anyone from the states want to come help out?)&nbsp;&nbsp; They presented us with some beautiful fruit carvings and a big stack of thank-you notes.&nbsp; The thing that touched us the most was when the head teacher (principle?) said thank you for teaching him that Love was free.&nbsp; We had tried to emphasize, among other things, that God loves us (esp. through His Son) and that his Love is a free gift.&nbsp; We were so excited that the message had been communicated!&nbsp; Since this was an English camp and not a church camp we did not have an invitation or any "who wants to accept Jesus" thing.&nbsp; Our aim was to teach them English excellently so that they would listen to the message that we had to share.&nbsp; Now, we pray that God will cause those seeds to grow and when they meet other Christians they will have an understanding of what they believe and they will be more open to the Gospel.&nbsp; We also pray that future English camps with these kids will be fruitful and that true believers will be brought out of the group.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Camp ended well and we were exhausted!&nbsp; Aiden, however, has struggled with teething all week long and his sleep has been sporadic.&nbsp; I think things are getting better and I certainly feel much more rested!  &nbsp;  On Thursday a group of farangs went out to plant rice.&nbsp; The Thais were being nice and helping us out so we could experience a little of what rice farming was.&nbsp; We planted a field of rice in 1 hour (it would take a group of Thais 30 minutes).&nbsp; Thais love to laugh and have fun and so while they were helping us get our rows straight and scoop spiders out of the flooded field they would say things like "will this rice grow?"&nbsp; Anyway we had a great time and our backs ached afterwards.&nbsp; We have a great respect for the people who spend weeks planting, go back and weed, and then harvest the rice!&nbsp;  &nbsp; Today we went to the border market that is on the Thai-side of the Thai-Laos border.&nbsp; We had a good time and bought some nice northern thai material.&nbsp; It is nice to get off the compound and see a little more of what Thailand is like.&nbsp; I think when we come back (for it seems that God may be leading us here in the future) I would like to live in a town or a village.&nbsp; Oh well, those are just my plans.&nbsp; We will see what God does.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Love you all!&nbsp; Good night.

      I've been informed that our blogging has been a little lax recently.&nbsp; This is partially due to laziness but we've have a pretty good excuse as well.&nbsp; For about three or four&nbsp;nights in a row Aiden decided he would wake up at 11:00, 2:00, and 4:00 for a good bout of crying and screaming.&nbsp; He's pretty much inconsolable during these voice lessons and as they last 1 hour or more Janiece and I have gotten very little sleep.&nbsp; He is still working on his top teeth; there are two white spots where the teeth are pressing against his gums but they refuse to come through.&nbsp; Last night we were blessed for the first good sleep this week as Aiden slept without crying from 7:00 to 5:00.&nbsp; Thank you Jesus!

      Well, its 5:30 in the morning and I'm stting here watching Aiden crawl around on the floor.  He's apparently been up since 2:00AM or so crying and fussing.  Janiece says I was saying the craziest nonsence at 2:30, all the while not waking up or moving a muscle.  She's exhasted so I took Aiden into the lounge so she could try and get some sleep.  Aiden seems to be teething again.  His emerging teeth push forward in the mornings and receed as the day goes on so that we can feel little sharp bumps when he wakes up but nothing later in the day.  It seems some sort of cruel joke for his worse teething times to coincide with our sleep :)  It's probably better this way though because having a fussy baby all day long can be quite a drag on the emotions.  Hope those teeth come forth soon!

      The other day Ryan killed a snake with a broomstick while Aiden and I watched.  Aiden gave his "gonna' cry" face and then let out a great big wail.  Yesterday Aiden was pulling up on Ryan's leg to get to the guitar that Ryan was playing.  Well, Aiden grabed a hunk of Ryan's skin and leg hair and Ryan let out a hollar.  Aiden burst into tears to go along with Ryan's yell.  Today Aiden bit me for the first time while nursing and he cried in response to my yell.  I can tell that my little boy is becoming more sensitive to the things that go on around him.  This serves as warning that I need to be careful about what he is exposed to.  I want to make sure he is around lots of the right thing and that he is around as little of the wrong thing as possible.

      Aiden is getting his top two teeth.  We've been expecting it for a while, but they are finally on their way!  I am teaching English today and so we will see how that works out.  No other exciting news other than the fact that I am eating hard-boiled eggs this morning!  *YUM!*

      We are getting things together for an English camp this weekend.  The kids will be middle-school age and are comming to learn English.  We hope to teach them useful English and also about God's love.  Josh, Mary Beth (a girl from the States), Jerry (a carreer-missionary lady who lives here), and myself are teaching about transportation.  I never thought I would be doing this and I am a little overwhelmed with trying to think of the best way to teach English.  Apparently in the schools they are only taught strict memorization and repition so hopefully we can teach them something a little beyond that.  Please pray for us this weekend and please pray for the students; that God would open their hearts to what we have to say about Him and that His Word would reap a harvest.

      Janiece and I went on a trip to Nan, one of the bigger cities around.  Wasana, our Thai language teacher, offered to babysit Aiden and gave us a chance to spend some time together.  While we were shopping Janiece found this really cute outfit.  Here is a picture of her showing off.  What a babe!    During the morning clinic we have half-an-hour or so in which the Thais sing some worship songs and then someone gives a short message or testimony.  Today Janiece talked about John 1 and how God sent his Son, the Word, to live among us so that through Jesus we could come to know God himself.

      We dearly missed watching fireworks in Carrollton this Fourth of July but we still had a good celebration here in Thailand!  We spent the afternoon swimming at a waterfall.  Aiden loves the water and once he got used to the roar of the waterfall he had a great time splashing and playing with rocks.  Then we came back and had hotdogs, potato chips, and soda for dinner.  Mary brought out a delicious cake and ice cream.  We all felt very full of food.  After that, they pulled out the fireworks: bottle rockets, sparklers, and some others that were big and gave a very satisfying boom in the sky.  All in all, it was a great Fourth of July.

      This was a busy weekend for us!  A team of students from a church in Oklahoma City came and helped us host an English Camp for about 140 kids from the Lua people group.  The camp was held over Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  We taught English by taking the kids through different stories in the Bible starting with Creation and ending with the Ressurection.  The camp was orgainized Thai-style which means that we were very flexible and didn't always know what we would be doing next.  We found that the kids listened to the story best when we had them come up and act it out as we told it.  The kids were reluctant to volunteer to act but when we said that whoever played Mary, Jesus' mom, would get to hold Aiden we had an eager volunteer.  About 13 kids said they were interested in becoming Christians so please pray that they will have their questions answered and that their families will be okay with their decision.  We are doing a similar thing this upcomming weekend and next weekend so pray that our energy levels can remain high!  It is dificult to go all week and not really have a weekend to rest.  Thank you for your prayers and support.

      We have been trying off and on to take a picture of Aiden's two teeth with limited success.  Today, however, Janiece was able to get a beautiful one.  What a cute little baby!  He is now 8 months old.

      Hi! Josh and I had a great anniversary trip.  We went to a nearby town and stayed at a resort (nice hotel on some land).  We walked into town to grab stuff to eat and pretty much just enjoyed each other's company and talked a lot!  Aiden is getting his 5th tooth but it is much easier than his last 4 teeth.  Here's hoping that all the future teeth are nice and easy.   Josh and Ryan are off on a mobile clinic this weekend.  I look forward to hearing how it went and seeing their pictures.  They are at an Akha village and that is a people group I have not had a chance to "meet" yet.  Apparently, the church is pretty strong in the Akha people group and they have an evangelist who is a second generation Christian and was sent to the US for Bible School.  That is the man that organized the clinic they are doing this weekend.  Please pray for them!  Meanwhile, I baked a cake with Saing today.  What fun!  Ovens are not standard fare among the people who live here so she had never done that before.  Unfortunately, Josh has the digital camera so I won't be able to post the beautiful pictures.  I did take 35mm pics though!  :)  Ok, I will stop typing and start posting the pictures.  Enjoy!

      In clinic yesterday I saw a follow-up patient that Joshua treated last week for diarrhea caused by an amoeba infection.  As with many patients, now that his primary illness was better he decided to trot out his less urgent medical complaints.  He said that for a few years he had been getting pins and needles sensations in his arms along with occasional muscle twitching.  I thought perhaps he had an electorlyte imbalance but his symptoms really didn't seem severe or consistent with any disease process.  He was Hmong, a hill tribe in Southeast Asia that has a rather unusual worldview that colors everything they percieve about the world including their disease symptoms.  Hmong patients will often present with seemingly random symptoms that they feel are all related to one another and obtaining a history from them can be very frustrating.  I wasn't getting anywhere so I asked him what he thought might be going on.  He then admitted that a few years ago he committed adultery with a woman in another province and he was worried about HIV or other STDs.  He had gotten himself checked at the hospital and was found to be negative for the virus but he was still very worried.  It seemed that he was actually struggling with feelings of guilt from his unfaithfulness to his wife.  Through one of the Hmong nurse-aides I told him that not only can our bodies become diseased but our spirits as well.  We told him that medicines can do nothing for sicknesses of the spirit, only Jesus can heal them.  He becames very interested when we shared the gospel with him and afterward he went to go talk to a Hmong missionary who works at the clinic.  I pray that the gospel of Jesus finds fertile soil in his heart.

      Well, our Blogging has slown down considerably but it doesn't seem that our life has.  The college girls that were here for the summer have gone back to the States and are probably sleeping off jet lag as I type this.  I miss them and Aiden misses them too.  Not that we will be here much longer.  I was reminding Josh yesterday that next week is the last full week that he has here at the clinic.... amazing.  Despite all the changes and some difficulties, it has really begun to feel like HOME here.  I do hope that God brings us back.  Josh and I will be dissappearing  for a few nights while we celebrate our 3 year anniversary (July 28).  Wow, 3 years married to an amazing man.  God has richly blessed me indeed.  This weekend Josh and Ryan are going with Dr. Tom to a very small village (14 families or so) for a mobile clinic.  Your prayers for their travel and ministry would be very appreciated.  After that we have our aforementioned "last full week," then we have part of a week, a flight to Hong Kong, a bit of time there taking advantage to see a place we have never seen, and then our flight back to Dallas.   Latest news in Aiden's world is that he is a monkey!  He has climed up on top of his walker, climed off a tall bed, tried to climb stacked chairs, and I am sure his climbing adventures have only begun.   Well, I am off for now.  It may be a while before you see another post on this blog.  Then again, miracles do happen and Ryan may actually blog while we are gone.  *laugh*
