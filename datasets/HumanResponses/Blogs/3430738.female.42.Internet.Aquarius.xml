             What can I say ... when it rains it pours. Things have gone no where but down hill since Thursday.          Actually things have been pretty horrid for almost a week. The last time anyone has touched me was a last Tuesday unless you count Ted throwing my hand off him when I touched him Friday night .... you would think others besides myself, would be trying to work things out.           I feel old, sick, and about as attractive as a wet smelly sock .... boytoy would rather have no one .. than to be loved by me. Pretty sad isn't it? I feel like I give so much love, I share so much of myself ... and I seem to always be the one slapped in the face.           I really can't go on right now .. maybe more tomorrow.

            Am i ready to talk about yesterday? No not really, but I guess i should try to get it out anyway.        I woke up yesterday with with a headache, so i checked e-bay .. did the e-mails and then i went back to bed. When i woke up the next time angel was getting ready to go to her hearing on Disability ... She had directions, i wasn't feeling so good, and someone had to be available to make sure Ted's lunch was taken. boytoy apparently wasn't happy with My not going so he made a few nasty refernces and was rather not nice about angel getting lost ... We tried to explain it was 3 whole turns.  Was pretty much a bust all around. I was pretty upset by the time she left and somewhat tired as well. So again i went to bed, boytoy was to wake me at 11 ... at 11:12 I woke-up on my own and got up to take a bath, then I was doing e-mail and e-bay till leaving time ... When angel got home ... No news till the Judge writes a letter of some sort.        angel and I took ted lunch, after lunch some sort of conversation started. It somehow turned to religion .. ohhh joy joy. boytoy has a rather Cult type mentality about religion .. he spouted something about it being ok for Christians like him to be able to judge others ... I pointed out that I feel that judging others is wrong and should be left up to God .... Apparently no one's opinion matters but boytoy's he began to yell and very rudely accuse everyone of being .... unworthy. He stated that our relationship was Crap .. because we don't 100% agree on religious following. He stated that he was done with this relationship, and that he no longer wished to be with Me. I refused to argue, and i eventually gave angel a kiss and waited to give boytoy a kiss and then was going to lay down. boytoy mis-understood and went to the bedroom as well ... thinking i wanted to talk ... I did not.  I simply told him that I wanted to give him a kiss before laying down ... and after tellng Me once again that he wishes to go back to Michigan where he belongs and give angel a divorce if she wants one, he went back to the living room to watch TV again.         I layed in bed and thought about the things that had just happened, I felt pretty shitty and USED actually. It seemed so apparent to me that boytoy is only here to be with angel, and that i am a means for him to be close to her. I knew i would feel like crap hearing this, but thinking it is actually just as bad. I love him, I give so much to him, and i work toward his happiness .... and I feel as if I'm the odd woman out.         When i woke up there was a  VENT  from angel in her journal ... all written as if it were questions to herself. She bitched about how i treat boytoy, not getting enough intemacy, and several other things. Course she says it's just questions to herself , so no one has a right to question them. *BULL*         No appoligies have been made, and everyone just wants to pretend that all is well. I explained to angel in no uncertain terms that SHE is not boytoy, that i correct her, discuss things with her, and such because she will listen .... When boytoy is in one of his moods .... He isn't capible of listening, and i have no intentions of hurting myself .. for no reason.   ********* such was yesterday *********

       OHHHHHH what a morning .. it's only 11:51 and already I want to scream and crawl back into bed.   Nothing seemed to go right today from the second I woke up .... I'm not ready to talk about it ... but I'm sure you will be the first to know when I can.

          What a day ... I picked up Chinese and took it to Ted for lunch.       After lunch angel and I went shopping ... I bought many hair claws and a few leather purses for conches. We will make many a dollar with the things found today. I am very proud.         After the shopping I began working on e-bay and answered a blog entry of timid's ... one she needed to have answers to. Hopefully the answers made her think. I also fielded 2 calls from lady and I hope some of the advice I gave helps ... she was crying a definantly in need of some re-assurance and thoughtful advice.        Once Ted got home we ate dinner and he went to Wal-Mart and bought the last Lord Of The Rings Movie and we sat as a family and watched it. Ted also worked on bracelets out of watch parts ... He has made several already ...        Not a lot otherwise .... I shall write More tomorrow .... Soon the 4 day weekend will arrive .... And it appears Allen shall meet gizzy for the very first time .... This should be interesting.

            Ok so now I realize that I might eventually enjoy doing this .... But we will actually see.        This morning was a little unusual, well not so unusual actually ... seems to be getting more frequent. Woke up after worrying all night that casper was going to die, to find the cat doing fine .. and flealess. I was happy and relieved. After checking the cat I went back in and got back into bed and dozed for a bit while waiting for boytoy to wake up.        Laying next to him is as close to heaven as a person can come, of that I am sure. He takes soft breaths, and his skin is so soft and covered with the finest hair ever, is so peaceful running fingers through it and feeling the hard flesh beneath it. Makes my heart skip beats ...        Once boytoy woke up and stretched, we talked for a bit, defanently one of my favorite things ... I enjoy just laying on his strong arms and talk to him. Course I couldn't help playing with his nipples , just a little. When he takes those quick deep breathes and his body comes alive under my fingertips it just heats me all up and makes My body and heart respond.        Even before sliding his boxers off it is VERY apparent he is more than a bit excited. I lick and suck his nipples while I begin to stroke his hard cock, and I smile to myself as he so eagerly responds. After stroking him a bit, I chose to slide down between his legs and I took his cock between my lips and sucked it gently, running my tongue around the head, it amazes me how hard he can get. My mind is so alive knowing I can make him get this hard and un-able to control how he feels.        So he asks * Can I put it inside you? * He wants it ... haha Yes he wants it. So I slide up and sit on his waist and let it slide a little under me. I love the look in his eyes, the sound of his voice ... the way he moves under me. I eventually let him slide in and I move with him as he thrusts inside me, his cock stroking all the soft warm moist velvet. My body feels like it will explode, so I sit up straight and ride his cock .... within a minute he is begging to cum ... wanting to explode deep inside ... So I allow it. After the tremors, I slide off of him and lay beside him as he says * I've never come straight up in a woman before. * I almost burst with excitement.        I wanted more, I pulled him to Me, put his lips on my skin and I felt on fire , the words and feelings were so strong... His fingers moved to my moist skin and he stroked me, sending quivers to My inner core. It felt so good to have his attention and his lips and hands on me. I felt so alive ...        Then he stopped, and said * Can I have a cigarette? * rolled over , got dressed and went to have a cigarette ... I have never been so frustrated in my life. I felt abandoned, I felt rather let down ... and as I said this is somewhat beginning to be a pattern ... he cums - he is finished ....         He has just been so upset lately .... I need to figure out what to do.   PART TWO .....         Tonight I spoke with timid~ for a bit. While doing e-bay and when my back started hurting a lot I signed off to take pictures and such. But before that Ted and I went to the bedroom and spent a little time together.         We layed together and kissed then he ran his hands down my body and caressed my innermost self. He stroked My nipples and kissed me till I was dizzy. Once I was ready Ted got up, dimmed the light and climbed onto the bottom of the bed and began to kiss my inner thigh, at least at first he was kissing my thigh, he was soon licking my pussy with his strong tongue .. working my clit till I exploded and needed to feel his hard huge cock inside Me.  He blessed Me by sinking his hard cock all the way inside my pussy, pumping as he rolled my nipples in his fingers. I scratched his shoulders and tried to pull him deeper and deeper inside Me. He fucked Me hard for about 10 minutes or so and then he told Me he wanted to cum with Me. So we came together... melting together .... He groaned as I moaned and called his name with desire.         He then climbed off the bed, cleaned up and handed Me a night gown. I dressed and we returned to the living room to work. I worked on earrings and such while Ted made 8 or 9 bracelets.         My goal is to have a wonderful weekend .. and that takes finances. So I will be listing again tomorrow.   SIDE NOTE : .....             timid~ is a very sweet submissive whom I have known on-line for quite some time ... We recently met her real time and she has become an extended part of our family ... You will I'm sure here a lot about her in future ...

            It's day two ... Should I or should I not post?        Today was pretty simple ... got up and took Ted lunch, He seemed in a good mood. After getting home , boytoy took the lawnmower to the shop and got it fixed .. thank goodness it only cost $11.00 ... Not so bad at all. Half the lawn got mowed.        After the lawnmower came home, angel, boytoy, and I ran to Hobby Lobby for a charm angel lost on Saturday night ... then picked up groceries and we hurried home.        After Ted arrived home and we made love, Ted took a bath while I finished listing on e-bay. I need to list much much more .. so we can maybe do something exciting this coming weekend. A 4 day weekend. After Ted's bath I jumped in and took one, and had boytoy wash-up as well ... he and I sometimes share a bath ... which is AWESOME. I decided that I might want to scene with boytoy tonight.        Tonight is here, I got the bed all set up with straps and things, waited till there was a great opening and some time to actually get into it and them told boytoy that we were going to play. Once back in the bedroom, boytoy told Me he really wanted to watch *2 and 1/2 Men* ... I was very disappointed, but told him to watch the show. In theory we are supposed to have the rest of our lives ... RIGHT!!!        I know it makes no sense, but I'm a little frustrated, I had really thought about this scene .... OHHHHH Well another night it might just happen ...        PART TWO ....         I bought flea and tick stuff today and gave both ginger and casper treatments ... ginger seems rather sedate .. tired , but is eating and such ... casper isn't doing as well. He seemed to be sick right after I did it ... the package said rinse the stuff off if a reaction happened so I did ... he still seems pretty upset ... not eating well ... laying around, has thrown up ... and has even been laying in the litter box.         I'm very VERY worried. boytoy is already freaking, and angel isn't helping much ... they are making ME feel horrible ... and I'm scared of how boytoy will react if casper dies ... As if I don't feel bad enough myself ...        Please let casper be ok ... please please please

       Yes I'm actually doing this ... putting thoughts into words ... and sharing them no doubt.   Maybe I should fill you in on who and what I am.   I am a woman, 42 ... Dark hair, blue eyes, and i would hope a pleasant personality.   I'm a wife ... married to Ted for 22 years - We met in High school and on Valentines Day Feburary 14th 1982 we married. I love My husband and I miss the man I fell in love with, the Man here now is so different than the Man I married. I still love him, but long for the him I knew, the one who held Me, the one who talked me thought nightmares, the one who could be a happy happy man, and make me a happy woman.   I'm a Mother. I have two wonderful handsome son's ... Who are growing up so fast. One is 21 and just graduated colledge, the other is 14 and has the potential of being a very successful person. I love My son's more than anything ... i want them both to be happy, I adore them.   I am a Domiant Woman ... What does this mean? Means I control myself, I control my enviroment, and I control others. Out of all these .... I control myself the most, I don't allow myself to enjoy life sometimes. I control others .. namely *boytoy* and *angel* ... these are the slaves associated to Me. They came to Me freely and offered, I accepted, and I try to do the best I can to assure thier happiness and emotional well being. I love them both, I am very in love with *boytoy* .... expect to hear alot about the people in my life.   I try to be a friend ... This is one of the things I struggle with. I have a deep lack of trust of people ... so letting someone in is hard for me. I adore them all, try to keep them close to my heart.   I guess I should close this entry ... My first entry ... I hope this let you see a little about Me.

       One of My favorite songs as a young adult ....     Richard Cory  They say that Richard Cory Owns one half of this whole town With political connections to spread his wealth around Born into society a bankers only child He had everything a man could want power grace and style  But I work in his factory And I curse the life I’m livin’ And I curse my poverty And I wish that I could be Oh I wish that I could be Oh I wish that I could be Richard Cory  The papers print his picture almost everywhere he goes Richard Cory at the opera Richard Cory at a show And the rumor of his parties and the orgies on his yacht Oh he surely must be happy with everything he’s got  But I work in his factory And I curse the life I’m livin’ And I curse my poverty And I wish that I could be Oh I wish that I could be Oh I wish that I could be Richard Cory  He freely gave to charity he had the common touch And they were thankful for his patronage and they thanked him very much So my mind was filled with wonder when the evening headlines read “Richard Cory went home last night and put a bullet through his head”  But I work in his factory And I curse the life I’m livin’ And I curse my poverty And I wish that I could be Oh I wish that I could be Oh I wish that I could be Richard Cory

        It's Monday and getting up was easy .. work needs to be done, besides who wants to be in that bed.   When it was time to take Ted lunch, angel and I picked something up and took it to him, while on the way I once again gave her the chance to discuss the Sex thing and was once again blown off. SOOOOO I being the bitch I am asked her - straight out - and was told she didn't mention it because she thought I knew ( what kind of a fucked up lie is that ) So I asked if I supposedly knew then why would I have asked about it? The truth was I wanted to make sure all went well, until the secrecy started.  I told her the fact was / is I do know about it, but didn't know how it went, and certainly didn't want to hear bitching about it later, so I checked up on him. There shouldn't have been a problem with that - unless something needed to be hidden???

        What can I say ... Apparently a nice relaxing weekend is out of the question - I was so sick Sunday I could barely sit up, kept trying to throw up, but at least it got better after we ate a very late lunch. I have been feeling out of sorts for several reasons ....    1. angel and Ted had sex and I sorta hinted around to her about it to see if all was well ( beings she complains so much about not getting enough, or it being to calculated, or just being sex and not the lovey dovey shit she seems to think she is entitled to ) and I was pretty much lied to, she kept it a secret and pretended nothing happened. Which throws up RED flags for Me ... I've been there before and I have seen it happen before, and I as the WIFE will not be putting up with it. She is NOT his girlfriend and anything that MY slave is involved in is MY business as well. Period. I gave her another chance to discuss it Sunday and was given the same reaction .... Hence I'm rather pissed off by the idea that she thinks she needs to lie to Me and keep secrets.   2. boytoy seems to be VERY lazy, un-feeling. and quite frankly self centered. He very seldom wants to help out with any projects, says un-caring hurtful things, and has the biggest Me Me Me attitude I have ever seen. Right now I am still in shock and I have been thinking of what I need to do to correct these things ... But My feelings are the only correction will be the one that will rip My heart apart.   3. More and more I see angel manipulate boytoy, or boytoy manipulate her.  I keep thinking I see her cling and hang all over him, but then I am looking with a broken heart. He can't seem to even enjoy a movie unless he is sitting close to her and asking her questions during the entire thing. When she smokes He smokes, When He smokes she smokes, and they hold little conversations while they are off together smoking, and i feel quite left out. I often feel that she owns him, and that his whole purpose for being here is to distract Me ( these are my insecurities - because I have no idea where i stand with him )  so that she could move in closer to Ted. Which is why he never complains about himself not getting enough sex or what-not ( doesn't even seem to be interested most of the time really )  ... but he seems to always know how sexually frustrated angel is and complains that she needs more. This thought eats at Me, and has pretty much made Me look at him & her in totally different light. It's true that sometimes I feel like I don't like her anymore ( the feelings eat at me ) , I feel used ... I feel My heart is being played with and I feel suspisious and suspect these emotions were planned from the start. I feel that maybe they think I will get so depressed I will Kill Myself ... then Ted and boytoy will belong to only her. And they will all three be happy.     Saturday we went to incredible pizza. Cost the family almost $175.00 for lunch and the tokens ... and not one single person outside Corey and Allen even really seemed to enjoy it. boytoy wanted to go off by himself first ( no surprise there ), Ted, angel, and I walked around together for a while till angel wandered off as well, beings I don't play games and Ted play's a very select few. Course once we found angel or she found Us ( tada tada We found boytoy as well - surprise surprise ) they seemed pretty happy and it looked as if they were hanging out together looking as much like a couple as anyone ever could. Pretty much makes me sick, and hurts Me more than i can put into words. She is nasty to him and yet he is so in love that he ignores it and acts as if she is the Goddess from heaven ....... I wanna throw up ( from stress ) everytime I think of the fact that boytoy cries and begs to have sex with her.  All in All saturday sucked.   Sunday we hung out at Kathy's while Ted built two crosses, with Minimal help. boytoy apparently would rather be with children,  if he can't be alone with angel. I was ill most of the day, and ignored ( you know boytoy does so well at paying attention to people other than angel NOT! I was ill and rather in need of some attention and affection ).  After lunch I felt better .... We got home late , watched some TV and went to bed.   Yes we all went to bed at the same time .. first time in a long time really. I was happy about this, I miss hearing boytoys breath and the feel of his arm around me while I sleep, I miss running my fingers in the hair of his chest or belly, as well as smoothing my finger over his thigh bone, relaxes me and I sleep so much better ( is so wonderful to just lay beside him). The last thing I remember was rubbing his thigh bone, I must have fallen asleep doing that. I woke up ( not sure about how ) and boytoy was on his back, when he has rolled over My hand had ended up in the soft hair at his cock, and he was hard. I don't know why ( I guess because he hadn't touched Me since thursday and because I wanted him so much) , but I stroked it ... I love the way it feels, and reacts ... boytoy without any words rolled over and pulled up my nightgown ... he entered Me from behind ( it was different ) the only connection with Me,  was his hand on My hip where he was steadying himself. It only lasted a minute or so ... it was over even before I could move his hand from my hip to my breast so i could feel the wonders of his touch. And it was really over .. he squeezed my breast once and removed his hand. He stayed still, and I tried to hold back tears and hold inside how shitty I felt, how used, how much I felt like a substitute .... I felt as if I was a pussy he could pretend was angel .... I felt like I was nothing - and certainly got nothing good out of what had happened. After a while he whispered  Thank You   and rolled back over ... I blamed myself and wondered if I had done something to cause this, I felt horrid, I had wanted him right? so why should I feel bad about getting him?  ... He then mumbled something about maybe being able to relax and sleep now, asked to go to the bathroom and went to have a cigarette .. and when he returned that is what he did, he slept. I continued to feel alot of emotion, none good , and all making me feel pretty used. I stayed awake a long time, My mind traveled though alot of emotion ... I finally feel asleep, wondering if maybe this would harden My heart some.

             I wish I had been able to have written yesterday when things were fresh in my mind .. but sometimes there is NO privacy here. When Ted feels I am not happy the privacy level goes even further down.        Ted had the day off and got up early to pack e-bay stuff to ship .... When boytoy got up he asked to take a bath and without thinking I said yes ... Nancy ( Corey's girlfriend ) came over so angel, me, corey and nancy went shopping. I was hoping and even mentioned to Ted that boytoy could either help him pack or could mow lawn while I was gone ... WRONG. Upon returning home, Ted was packing and boytoy was doing word search puzzles ... Ted didn't really seem so very happy. And I understood why, I asked why boytoy didn't mow some and was told he had taken a bath and was clean and didn't want to get dirty. Without starting a fight I just mentioned he could have re-bathed.        Later I wasn't feeling well so I went back to lay down and rest a bit .... Ted came back and wanted to make love ... played with me a bit, disappeared and had asked boytoy to join me back in the bedroom, boytoy seemed upset about this .... When Ted joined us ( while we were simply talking ) and made it clear he wanted to give me a threesome ( which he knew I had been missing ) boytoy got even more upset. Ted left and boytoy again started with the crap ( How I hate that crap ). He has such a way of making Me feel overly horrid, and as if I am such a bad person for loving him.        What did he say ( remember this is not word for word as it's the day after ...    1. He's just not happy.   2. He doesn't think he is ever gonna get angel to work on things. I stupidly asked what things ... and was told wife and husband things. Why does this hurt Me so much.   3. This place will never be home, Michigan is home.   4. He loves me, but he doesn't love me like he loves angel.   5. When his mom dies, when he goes home he will stay to take care of the estate anyway. This came out of the blue and really floored me .... Almost as if he was looking forward to it , which I know he doesn't.        I cried alot, but really tried to stand My ground. I pointed several things out to him. That angel doesn't love him in a romantic sorta way, That he is usually happy and that He himself causes his level of happiness to go down. I told him that if I could make her want things to work out , I would because I love him, but that I can't so he needs to accept and be as happy as he can be. I offered to send him back to Michigan, this would hurt me very much, but I'm so tired of trying to hold on to someone who just wants to wallow in self pitty and can't even see how good his life is. He didn't give me a date for his departure and gave me the impression that he really doesn't want to go. I have no idea, and this un-certainty is very difficult for me.        After Our talk .. Well his talk and my cry, Ted came back and he made love to Me before we fell asleep ... A short but needed nap. Upon waking up I checked e-bay, and answered some e-mails ... ended up inviting bree-ann to come over for a movie ( Mystic River ) .... I got through if fairly well.

             What can I say .. today started out like any other, I got up early and began working on e-bay ... listing and re-listing items in order to work toward a perfect family vacation in July. While listing I spoke with lady on the phone and helped her out with some issues as she listened to mine. lady is a great friend and adores My family.        After speaking with lady and hanging up, I got my stuff together and prepared to take Ted lunch ... angel and I stopped at the gas station and picked him up Chicken planks and a polish sausage ... he is having teeth issues and so the sausage was easier for him to eat. We need to get him to a dentist to get the infection out of his tooth. While I was having lunch with Ted boytoy called and said the doctor wanted to change my appointment and wanted me there by 1:30 .... so Off to the doctor I went ... Wooo Hoooo like that excited me.  ***************   At the Doctor's today he gave me My 3 month check-up ....  The Goal for My HgBA1C is to be less than 7.0 ... on 9/5/2003 I was at 7.7  .... at my last reading 4/14/2004  I was at 5.9 ... this is the count of someone that is Not diabetic .. course that is with my medication  The Goal for My LDL Cholesterol is less than 100 ... Mine is now 79  My weight is down over 50 pounds  My Systolic BP Goal is less than 130   ... Mine is 126  My Diastolic BP Goal is less than 80   ... Mine is currently 92 ... but apparently this is not a big deal as this is the only time I have ever been over 70 before  He said the only real things I need to work on is being more active and exercising 3 times a week for at least 1/2 hour .... this only counts if My heart rate is elevated.  All in all a very good day at the Doctors.   **********************       After returning home from the Doctor I was sitting talking to boytoy and angel and teasing him about needing more exercise of the sexual kind and he blew Me away by volunteering to stop watching a movie to go to the bedroom with Me and exercise. O not being stupid said OK ...  So after Ted called at 3:00  boytoy and I went to the bedroom and talked a little,  while we played with eachother, I have been on My period and it was soon before I was so excited I climbed on top of his hard cock and pumped up and down till he spilled his cum deep up inside Me.        I then lay beside him and we cuddled and talked some more , about feelings and such, He told Me he loves Me and I told him how much I love him, the things about him I love ... and I stroked his nipples a little. Within' a little while boytoy was hard again, was sucking My nipples and was inside me again .... His hard cock filling me with rampant emotion and lust. I seem to feel that a lot around him.   After some time he rolled over on his back and held Me while we talked again. I Love talking to him.       I licked his cock and reveled in the taste of the two of us together,  I stroked him and within a short time I was sucking his nipples and playing with his cock and he was moaning again .... Once he showered my hand with his seed, He and I cuddled and dozed till I got up at 5:10 .... boytoy awoke at 6:00 when I went and woke him for dinner so we could go to the movies as a family ....   We saw Jersey Girl ..... and it was an awesome movie ....   All in all an AWESOME DAY.

       Your Mine  Turn over to Me your pleasure Give over to Me your  pain Show Me what you dream of And I'll give you all that is sane.  Tell Me how the whip feels When it touches the skin so fine Does it make you crave My taste And beg Me to take you as Mine.  Does the violet wand excite you And fill your heart with desire Do you crave the feeling Of the body probes stroke of fire.  Blindfolded and Cuffed up high With the cold steel hidden from sight I hear your heart beat quicken in passion And I know what will happen this night.  Cast away what is being held back Allow your limits to be set free I Will force you over the edge  And make you give yourself  to Me.  Give up to Me the heart and soul The one you hold in your hand Let Me mold your body and mind Till before Me kneels My one man.  Slaves have many hopes and desires Things they need and want to hear  Kneel before Me, say what I desire  Your Mine, you have nothing to fear.   Rose 12/30/03

        Our Wild Hot Night  My dreams are of you here in my arms Our bodies emitting hot sensual sighs If only you could hear my desprite moans And I bathe in your exhilarated cries  You lay me down upon satin sheets, Our hands, senses, and mouths explore You devour me once, you possess me twice, Our bodies intertwine and our minds soar  You taste me here, I lick you there, We share our bodies heady wine Exploring eachothers secret needs, Neither connected to the bindings of time  I call to you dream with me, As My hunger burns inside me deep. I pray this fire that burns not end And the desire raging in my heart keep.  Rose 12/26/03

       My Angel   While walking in the busy world today I came upon an angel, bright and gay,  she whispered things, and opened dreams she'd wanted someone to love, it seems.  At first I could not truly believe In my heart I worried she would leave,  Every day I watched her move and play And waited with fear for her to go away.  Days passed, weeks, and months as well the winter came and the snowfall fell,  when spring flowers bloomed, I began to see this angel was at peace just to be with Me.  This morning I looked at her soft red hair her face in sleep was more than I could bear, the wings were gone, no more she'd fly  and I accepted My angel with a peaceful sigh.   Rose 1/8/2004

       I Want   I want  ..  your eyes deep and blue sensual looks taking my breath,  making the mind whirl.  I want ..  your voice velvet and sweet whispering longings feeding temptations, guiding the burning hunger.   I want ..  your teeth sharp and forceful caressing nibbles biting my nipple, urgeing quakes inside.   I want ..  your hands stroking  and coaxing finding the hidden prize  entering heaven, yielding groans of desire.   I want  ..  your cock hard and swelled   plunging  within forcing moans, passion deeply pulsating.   I want ..  your heart tender and caring sharing emotion silently building, acknowledging Love.    Rose  1/6/2004

       I Find Myself Thinking   I find Myself thinking about  ..  wax sensual warm drips and heated  layers building upon the flesh inner warmth ,  The Heat of your Love.   I find Myself thinking about ..  needles sharp and strong they peirce the skin sinking into you, taking you to a place most never find, The Strength in Love.   I find Myself thinking about ..  blades scratching the surface of fear,  expecting the next tingling movement  sweet anticipation, The cutting edge of Love.   I find Myself thinking about ..  music filling the mind, enveloping the senses  new heights with each note soaring away, Love sound erotic.   I find Myself thinking of ..  love the gentle touch, whispered words twisted sheets with warm quick breathes deep moans, Love is You.   Rose  12/30/2003

       Afterglow of Sceneing   The afterglow of the scene is upon me bathed in the warmth of a shinning light. Having danced that dance of motion and remained  inseparable all  night. We lay  barely moving, talking, stroking keeping the distance between us in sight.   My hands softly feeling your tremors your goosebumps like stars in the sky I kiss your eyes to say I love you silently and holding you tight not knowing why. Stroke your cheek and whisper gentle words taste your breath and feel the mingling of our sighs.   I had  dreamed of never having, of never being brought by the fates,  you now belong to Me. When I hold you in my arms,  and we breath it is as if we are one, I look in your eyes and me I see. Let's reminisce, and let our hearts wander in silence the afterglow of sceneing, somehow sets the pain free.   Rose  12/23/2003

          This is something sent to Me by a boy I once chatted with ... He was not mine, was never collared to Me ... He somehow found happiness by calling Me Mistress .... I wanted to save his words as they touched Me deeply ...    Rose, My Sweet Mistress, I dedicate this hypnotic induction to You. You inspired it, this is a tribute to a wonderful Mistress. I write all of my hypnotic inductions and scripts, and the other day as i was writing some thing new, You entered my mind, and this is what happened    Rose Induction Daylan Smith CCHT    Imagine  a beautiful deep red closed Rose, the petals curled slightly outward, revealing occasional dew drops from the morning shower.  The Rose petal begins to uncurl and like a movie speeded up you can actually see the petals begin to unfold in slow motion.  The Rose is velvety soft and a wonderful perfume begins to caress your nostrils, and as the Rose uncurls, little by little, you are completely absorbed in the beauty of the Rose.    Slowly and gradually the petals open up as the perfume becomes heavier and more powerful.  The Rose is a wonderful deep shade of crimson and the contrasting green leaves with delicate threads running through, entrance you.  You marvel at the beauty of the Rose.  You may begin to wonder at the center of the rose......................how will you see it?  Will the flower open up enough?  The inner petals are carefully wrapped around each other like a closely guarded secret.  And as you focus your mind completely on this beautiful Rose you may feel drawn to the center of theRose and its almost as though you are entering the flower as that once tight bud begins to uncurl, and you're being drawn into the center and into the stem - and its as though you're traveling through a long tunnel, and even as you find yourself being drawn into and through this tunnel you can sense and feel and know that you are safe - you are comfortable - you are at one with the world and the universe and all creation.  And if you wish you can pause here because you now have a choice.  You can continue through the stem of the Rose until you find your root - going back and back - deeper and deeper - down and down - and when you find your roots you can enter the beautiful earth and be in touch with the very essence of your being.  Or you can return to the center of the Rose and look out from that beautiful bud onto a beautiful day.  You may see the sun shining down on you - or you may feel the gentle morning dew - you can radiate out your perfume - even though you won't be aware of that perfume yourself - you can see the world through a new pair of eyes, as though you're looking on it now as never before.  You see colors you never imagined possible - you hear the sound of the grass whispering to each other, you can feel insects scurrying by, carrying out their daily work.  You are a beautiful Rose...................and as you go deeper into this wonderful feeling and become more and more relaxed as the Rose controls your every move with softness ans gentleness you become one with the Rose and it guides you deeper and deeper than youve ever let youself go before.... because you know that you can trust the Rose to protect you....... now as i count from ten down to one with each passing moment and each beat of your heart and each sound of my voice you go deeper and deeper into this wonderful place of peacefulness and tranquility a place only you can go.......ten.......deeper.....nine love you MIss ROSE your daylan

       As you can see from My last post .... I am in serious doubt as to what My life is all coming to.   I Love Ted .. That is clear.  I love boytoy .. That is equally clear. I could if I have to watch boytoy walk away, I'm just not sure I could ever get over loosing him. He is a part of Me, I desire his submission more than I have ever desired anything before.   Where do I go from here?

       Camp-Out report ....        We arrived on Gaea Kansas ... to find a beautiful setting in a wooded area and a wonderful selection of kinky folk ... We had selected to stay in a Cabin so after having friday dinner with the group we checked-in and actually went to check out the sleeping quarters. At first entering the place i thought .... OMGoodness where the hell is a tent when you need one .... it seemed musty and has 12 cots in it .... taking up alot of space making it seem semi small .... but once we seetled inm turned on the ceiling fans, the twinkling lights outside, and investigated how SOFT the cots were  ---- I was in LOVE and began planning how to get cots home .... We rearranged a bit to place some cots together to make it a little more family friendly and then took our butts over to check-out this HUGE bathhouse we heard about.      Huge it was ... never seen so many hoses outside a fire house .... And the water was HOT - all the time. Day and night, and i did check that out.      After finishing what business we had to do, we headed back to the bonfire ... Several discussed herbs and such and we just relaxed and vegged .... maybe we relaxed too much cause dang was Ted tired ... so after a while we excused ourselves and headed off to the cabin to have a drink and get ready to turn in. Once everyone was seetled and it got dark I kissed Ted and boytoy goodnight, but even tho I was on my period i decided to make boytoy cum for Me .. so I began to carress his chest and nipples, Ted began to work some with angel, i really didn't pay attention there , i heard slapping and such which is how i knew. After a while boytoy was ready so I put my lips on his cock and made him cum for Me. End of night 1 ....  Saturday morning was an early rise day. Been a long time since i woke to chirping birds and such ... you can take the Mistress out of  the country,  But the Counrty is always in the Mistress. Boytoy went to look around and I initiated waking ted up ... wanting to enjoy ted even tho i was still on my period. After sucking ted's cock a little while, i moved to his nipples while angel sucked his cock some .... angel has problems with any Man cumming in her mouth so she stopped short, and  i don't agree to sharing fluids with her so i refused to continue for her ... and thought he could just finish the old fashioned way .... MAN did that start one big fight ... apparently if Ted isn't getting a whole BLOW JOB he doesn't want any He refused to finish and angel threw a fit, felt hurt, yadda yadda yadda ... I was pretty upset because i really didn't understand why he was being so crude and rude about not wanting to FUCK after being promised a BLOW JOB ... angel threatened to leave .. I felt horrid and was terrible upset.  We had lunch in Our Cabin and the fight lasted till after i got sick and fell asleep asleep. When I awoke it was raining Ted got out the Voilet Wand  .... both Ted and I used it on angel and i took boytoys hand and gentry used his fingers as well ... this seemed to excite him alot, caused me some emotional trauma, but what can i do ... I can't make him not LOVE her ... She had some new open boils on her inner thighs ( this still concerns ME so much ) .... After the scene while ted was finishing up ( again not sure in what way ) .. I took advantage of how excited boytoy was , i stroked him and whispered in his ear about how wonderful his cock is, I asked him if he enjoyed helping in the scene and he said  *YES*  and even tho it hurt i continued to stroke him, telling him whom he belonged to, I made him suck my nipples till i felt like i was going to go crazy with desire ... I so wish I really owned him. When I needed to stop and he was fairly close I again sucked him hard and fast till he shot his load of cum hard and long in my mouth. Then I held him in My arms, his cheek against My breats and he dozed off with Me stroking his cheek and hair. Once he fell asleep i dozed as well.       After the raining stopped ... Ted, angel and I showered together in the showerhouse while boytoy went up top and down to the lake.      The dinner saturday night was wonderful and we sat on  a blanket with a couple of angels and two of the HOTTEST Master type MEN in the camp and visited with several other lifestyle people. ALL in ALL a wonderful time. After dinner we all headed down to the covered building and some play was done .... But by this time we were fading fast ... somewhat ... So after a while we headed back to our little cabin. .... end of day 2 ....       UP and at-um ... Off to the showerhouse all 4 of us ... This was where i realized my blouse didn't fit .. i pointed out to angel she had packed the wrong one and she began sulking and was actually quite rude to me. Then we headed up top to breakfast. Roberts angel got my breakfast and i was very happy about it.       After breakfast we visited a while, and then went back to the cabin to pack-up some stuff .... During the packing angel again got pretty nasty and so i pointed out to her why I had corrected her about the blouse. She continued to get more and more insulting, dragging boytoy into the situation and being down right rude and nasty as well as out and out lieing several times, i yelled at her when she began screaming ... i was so pissed by that time. She marched out and began having boytoy take off her jewlery .... again dragging him into her crap ... She never seems to be able to do anything but drag him into things .... Once her ass calmed the hell down .... I was pretty much berated ... I'm too easy on boytoy and to hard on angel. I'm supposed to correct anything boytoy does wrong and yet not correct angel anymore ... Seems no one around here really knows thier possition, but ME ... SHIT I know what i do .. and correcting someone who packs the wrong clothing , even after being asked about it is the correct thing for the Mistress to do. I just decided to hold MY toung and try to get along with her .. I sure wish i could MAKE boytoy love Me, if I could I wouldn't put up with this Bull crap.       I was very suprised and happy when Ted suggested that I call timid and see if she would like to get together before we leave KC. So even tho angel didn't seem overly happy I jumped for joy and called ..... I was excited , to actually see a real submissive. We stopped at Torrid's one of My favorite stores. I bought a few things and we went out to eat with timid ... my only regret was no time to speak to timid. Really. I was sick the whole drive home .....

          This morning after posting the last Blog entry I was ready to turn in ... boytoy was watching a horror film he had rented but I was ready for bed. I didn't really feel so right going off to bed and leaving him up alone so after kissing him goodnight I asked him if he wanted someone to stay up with him ... he said he would be fine , but wondered why I asked ... I told him. I also told him that I would sleep in PJ's again so he wouldn't have to get to crazy on me again tonight. He asked what I meant, so I tried to explain to him how I felt ... he didn't seem to understand that I had felt that way. I sat down to talk to him and we had a very wonderful conversation. Filled me with hope actually. I ended up staying up with him ... even tho horror is not my thing.   During the third portion of the movie, he sat with his back laying against Me, and I put my arms around him .. this is by far my favorite way to sit. I can stroke the soft hair on his chest and swim in the sensation it gives me. It definantly gives sensations .. all the way to the toes. I like to run my nails over his nipples and feel them harden ... His breath usually changes with this action as well ... and this morning I could actually stroke his nipples and chest and watch his cock harden as I did. I love this Man so much.   He reached for Me and softly asked *  Can I make Love to You?  * I told him that there was no hurry and that we could finish the movie first .... amazing I actually have restraint ... I continued to enjoy just being with him till the movie ended .... then I made sure the children were in Bed and such .... upon returning I sat on the couch and when he got up and again reached for Me ... I pulled him to Me, undid his belt and zipper and quickly allowed his wonderful cock to feel air upon it ... and then it felt My lips upon it, sucking boytoy is one of my favorite things ... and he kissed the top of My head, was making the most delicious sounds and trembled while I sucked him ... it made sense to me that he was not going to last long with Me doing this .. so I slowed down, savored the taste and texture ... and those Ohhh so wonderful sounds. He seemed to get weak in the knees and sounded as if he was not going to be able to take it much longer when I allowed him to help me lay down on the couch. His lips were on Me and his cock was in Me so quickly. The look in his eyes drives me crazy, I love him so much ... He said *  I Love You  * while he drove his cock deep inside , his hips meeting mine, I felt like My body was on-fire. I couldn't say much except *  I want you to Love Me so Much.  *  His answer was *  I really do Love You , I know I don't show it all the time, but I do.  * My heart was overwelmed and I started crying ... Too much emotion going on ... He wiped the tears. Within minutes my boytoy asked if he could cum inside me.... I gave permission and everything burst inside .... He stirs so much feeling ....   After while still laying on top trying to breath and relax a little, he apologized about cumming to quickly and I once again explained to this man/boy I love so much .. that the time spent having the actual act isn't important .... it's the feelings that mean so much .... and he makes me feel more than he will ever know ...   This was not expected and I'm not sure I will ever forget it !!!!

            Well today is Tuesday ... not sure what that means , but it does mean at least some things are better around here. I hope anyway.        Today started out pretty pitiful .. I was extremely hurt ... was / am so close to hanging up my life ... I was that un-happy.        Let me begin by saying I am in 3 major relationships and often I shall address one at a time .... such as tonight ...    1. Ted         Things seem to be getting better with him ... sort of ... if he could just get over trying to MAKE Me be happy all the time.  *NOTE*  Last evening we sent boytoy and angel to the store and Ted and I made love, probably the best love we have made in at least two years ... Made me tremble ... was awesome ....    2. angel          Not sure ... really ... I feel she controls boytoy ... I know she hurts him ... and that causes me pain and confusion about her.    3. boytoy           This relationship seems to be going to the birds ... and is taking me on a roller coaster ride ... up and down ... up and down. It has been a week since boytoy has touched me in a sexual way .... but this morning he rolled over and let Me stroke his chest and when I got to his nipples he took in a deep breath and trembled, he wanted it - that was clear ... and for the longest time I moved my hands all over teasing him and such without touching his hardness .... he was moving and I could tell he wanted it badly ... when I went to bite his nipple he kissed Me .... a REAL kiss .... one of those  *make your pussy dribble*  kisses .... I stroked him while he kissed me and until he cam so hard .. all over ... and he whispered to me for a little while even promised to make Love to Me today ... then he needed a clean-up device .. so I went to get him one  *BIG mistake*  by the time I got back he had rolled over so that he was already back to Me ..... I wanted to cry ... I gave him the towel and went to the livingroom .... HURT is an understatement ....  Once I returned to bed, and morning came .... boytoy and I cit-chatted a little bit, and then he rolled over back to Me again, so I rolled over back to him - he reached to touch my hip ... felt skin and stuffed the blanket between us again ... I got up and slept on the couch the rest of the morning ... Once again Hurting pretty bad.    Special For Ted  ... When I came to the livingroom after what boytoy did Ted followed me .. we talked a bit ... he held me a bit ... and we went out on my patio , put down some pillows and made love right there ... it was night , so no one was supposed to be outside ... but afterwards while we were still just being together there were people going between two houses on the street. But it was VERY enjoyable. I wish it could take away how I feel about boytoy.
