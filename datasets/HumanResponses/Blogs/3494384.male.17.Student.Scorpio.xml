      Weather: Cloudless, cold, windy. Mood:    Mixed  Just recovered from crying... Lolx... Was talking on the phone with my ex... Did exchange some heated words but nothing that will actually create hatred among us... Just smsed him and told him to steer clear of me and I will too... Until I get over him and such... Lolx...  Still talking to Wan Xin and was feeling much better... Dont know why but I just love to talk to her and tell her everything... We are going out on June 3rd with Wenfong... (Knew them from my first part-time job) Really a blessing to know them. Nice girls... Friendly too.. :) Going out for? We are going to do hair... Yay!!! Finally can get rid of the ugly 'grassy' hair I had for erm... like 2 months le... It's like a long time since I meet up with them also le... Looking forward worz...  Im downloading from IRC now... Waiting so anxiously... It was a song by Toro... I didnt know he have new works until two days ago when I went to HMV and found Toro's name on one of a album where 5566 and K-One worked together... 5566 and K-One sucks like hell... Lolx... Dont really like them... Wonder what kind of song will it be... The album cover describe the song as a Hip-Hop kind of song... How nice...  Starting to feel comfortable with this blog now... So my day today actually isnt bad... I actually wake up at around 1 pm and used the computer to like now! My parents didnt even whined! What a miracle! Lolx... Was just gunbound gunbound and gunboung the whole day with Lishen and Daniel... We really dominant other people with the 'Misses' gimmick... Lolx... We will be making a reputation for ourselves soon for being so 'heel' and we were like swearing the whole time. I didnt reliase that Gunboung can be so addictive at time after you had lost interest in it... Lolx...   Before that, after I've lunch (Just plain Maggi Mee which my Mum helped to cook for me which I cant finish it, lolx...), I watch Sailormoon Live Action whcih I have already downloaded for DAYS already... A really nice show... Sailormoon always was my favourite anime beside Doraemon... I know Im childish... Lolx...  Before that (just when I just woke up)my Mum called me to go downstair and helped my parents carry somethings back home... My Dad actually bought a new Vacuum Cleaner and a new Cordless Telephone... Was so shocked! What a waste of money. I just used the cordless phone and found that it isnt very good. Maybe some cheap phone... Lolx...  A very mixed emotion day... Lolx... Got such decription de mahz?  Well, time to move on with life... School will be starting soon on June 21st and Orientation should be around 17th and 18th... Dont really care... Stupid orientation. Waste time only... Lolx...  So I gotta go sign off now. It is so late now... Got to sleep before my parents whine at me for using the comouter the whole day.   Signing off - Ronald

      Didnt have much energy to blog recently... Was having a hangover yesterday... I drank too much liaoz... People who know me well will know that I dont drink de... I even pick up smoking le... Im not addicted though... Talking about 2 days ago...  Me, Christ, Xinhui, Wenfong and Wanxin we all went to the airport and eat together... F Bu 5 de reunion... Since I already left the Palsm foodcourt of course I look forward to the gathering... The rest of them are still working there... Christ quitting on the 20 of June while the others are quiting on the 19... I was shock that Christ is quitting... I did ask her why she quit but she just told me that later she will then tell me but she never... Shouldnt have given so much pressure on her bahz... She changed alot... From last time very innocent to now... But she is still as warm as like in the past... :)  Anyway, we went to Sakae Sushi to have our lunch lorhz... I was late as like always... Im known for being late nowadays... I dont know when I pick up this habit of being late... lolx... Was actually so fun but Xinhui didnt quite enjoy cuz she didnt like sushi de... And the whole 2 hours we were like eating and playing but she just sat there... Listening to her discman and playing with her handphone... We forgotten that she dont like to eat sushi but she still come when we ask her too... Seems like she didnt want to be a spoilsport lorhz... Xinhui is a nice girl... Then hor after that, we didnt know where to go to... Then I think Wanxin brought up the idea of cycling so we went to Eunos and took a taxi to East Coast... turn out that we have to actually hired 2 taxi because of the number of passenger allowed in a taxi... Haha... What the hell... went to East Coast then Christ suddenly told us that Daddy and Jean will be coming down for drinking... Jean was mad at Christ for not calling her when she awake cuz the day before, Jean told Christ to do so... Everyone try to call Jean but she didnt pick up the phone... She is quite petty de... Christina cried again... See liaoz me also no mood to cycle... Then Daddy called her she also never pick up the phone...  Thus everyone keep calling her... She finally took Christ's call...  Christ cried while on the phone... Then Xinhui took the phone and speak to Jean cuz Jean is her Mummy... Then me Wanxin and Wenfong went to sit at the rock on the beach... We were later joined by Christ and Xinhui after Jean promised to come to East Coast...   The scenery was so nice and we sit by the sea and chat lorhz... Then Wanxin's friend sms her to invite her to some birthday party but because due to her working, she couldnt make it and she was so stressed... She have some problems with her friends now cuz all of them told her that she changed alot and have neglected all her friend yi da tui... But no lorhz... Wanxin never changed... This kind of attitude from her friend is starting to depress Wanxin now... Then hao call bu call, her father called her... Wanxin reject the phone call and cried... Very jia lat de... All cry de... Some personnal reason bahz... Then what happen liaoz... My mind so blur le..   I remember that Jean came and then Christ and Xinhui went to drink with Daddy and Jean... Left me Wanxin and Wenfong... We sit down and chat for a bit before walking... Wenfong have to go to Sparks cuz of some birthday celebration so me and Wanxin take her to find bus lorhz... Wenfong then told us about some problems she faced... Looks like almost everyone have problems of their won...   Was back at East Coast at around 8+. We meet up with Christ and Xinhui... Went to cycle till aound 10+ The place was so nice at East Coast... Night cycling is so fun... We settle down at one of the pier at the end of the cycling track... We stayed there to watch the sky...   Dont know why... My tears flow... I also want my ex to be with me de... Hiaz... Wipe my tear and we all cycle back...  Jean and Daddy was still there... We join them for drinking... I dont know why but I went drinking also... Xinhui offered me a puff and I did smoke... The brand of the cigarretee remind me of my ex...   I drink until Im dead drunk... I dont want to think of what hapen liao after Im drunk... I hurt Christ and Jean bleed because of me... Wanxin lost her wallet also during that day... Christ cried again... Wanxin Wenfong and Christ sent me home... I reach home and fall asleep... I did called my ex... He seems very irritated with me... He didnt call me liaoz...  Fuck the whole world for being so dark...  Signing off - Ronald

Cuz today he called in the afternoon to chat cuz he doesnt feel like going to gym. So we talk and talk and then dont know for what shit, I began to be childish again and we bicker lorhz... As though Im his bf like that... Me always want him to give in to me de... Then like that lorhz... I slammed the phone on him... Then around 10 plus I smsed him Sorry and all and told him to call... I think seeing the time now, he wouldnt be calling le... Either VERY angry or tired... Dont care bahz... Me and him no chance le...  Before we argue, he told me he like another guy... I mean, how can he told me such stuff? He know I still have feeling for him and he told me that? I mean, ya, we are friends now but then where can tell me such things de... I dont really feel good but just play along lorhz... Anyway, I wish to forget about him and then move on with my life... I was quite succeed... Until I saw MTVs of gay couple and then I mess it up liaoz... Thinking of my ex le... Still thinking of him now... Sometimes I wishes that he is beside me now and I can hug him like before... But that isnt going to happen...   Anyway... He duped me de... Why should I care so much... Maybe I really didnt treasure him before when we are together... I dont know...   Christina called at 10 plus and tasked me to go out them tomorrow to eat sushi!!! My fav food worz!!! Yum yum yum!!! Agree without any hesitation though Im gonna bankrupt very soon... But never mind de... I'm gonna see my wifes tomorrow le... Wenfong and Wanxin... Missed them so much... Especially Wanxin... She have some problems recently but I hope she is coping well...

It was all so sudden that I told him all these... We were having a very good chat when I erupted and told him all that... I told him that Willy is better than him in alot of ways. I told him that I feel that he is heartless and all... I asked him several questions...   Do you still have feelings for me?  He said: A little.  Do you cried because of the break up? He said: No. I was.  I almost cried... After that we hang up... He told me: I hope you can find someone better than me. I told him: I will always love you.   He said he like us to be friends only... I dont mind... I must say that he is a great friend... But... I dont know... I really love him... A one-sided love will never blossom...   -----  Whitney Houston - I will always love you  If I should stay, I would only be in your way. So I'll go But I Know I'll think of you every step of the way.  And I will always love you I will always love you. You, My Darling You...  Bittersweet Memories, That is all I am taking with me. So, goodbye. Please don't cry. We both know I'm not what you-you need   And I will always love you, I will always love you  I hope life treats you kind. And I hope you have all you dream of. And i'm wishing you joy and happiness. But above all this- i'm wishin you love.  And I will always love you. I will always love you. I will always love you. I will always love you.  I will always love you I will love-you... You, darling I love you. Ooh I'll always, I'll always love you.   -----  I guess that I really cannot get over him... This song is very nice...

      A long time ago, there was a huge apple tree. A little boy loved to come and play around it everyday. He climbed to the tree top, ate the apples, took a nap under the shadow... He loved the tree and the tree loved to play with him.  Time went by... The little boy had grown up and he no longer played around the tree everyday. One day, the boy came back to the tree and he looked sad.  "Come and play with me," the tree asked the boy.  "I am no longer a kid, I don't play around trees anymore."  The boy replied, "I want toys. I need money to buy them."  "Sorry... but I don't have any money... but you can pick all my apples and sell them. Then you will have money."  The boy was excited. He grabbed all the apples on the tree and left happily. The boy never came back after he picked the apples. The tree was sad. One day, the boy returned and the tree was so excited.  "Come and play with me," the tree said.  "But I don't have time to play. I have to work for my family. We need a house for shelter. Can you help me?"  "Sorry but I don't have a house. But you can chop off my branches to build your house."  So the boy cut all the branches of the tree and left happily. The tree was glad to see him happy but the boy never came back since then. The tree was again lonely and sad. One hot summer day, the boy returned and the tree was glad.  "Come and play with me!" the tree said.  "I am sad and getting old. I want to go sailing and relax by myself. Can you give me a boat?"  "Use my trunk to build your boat. You can sail far away and be happy."  So the boy cut the tree trunk to make a boat. He went sailing and never showed up for a long time. Finally the boy returned after being away for so many years.  "Sorry my boy, but I don't have anything for you anymore. No more apples for you... " The tree said.  "I don't have teeth to bite." the boy replied.  "No more trunk for you to climb on..."  "I'm too old for that now." the boy said.  "I really can't give you anything... the only thing left is my dying roots." the tree said with tears.  "I don't need much now, just a place to rest. I am tired after all these years." The boy replied.  "Good! Old tree roots are the best places to lean on and rest. Come, sit down with me and rest."  The boy sat down next to the tree. It was glad and smiled with tears.  *****  This is a story for everyone. The tree represents our parents. When we were young, we loved to play with Mom and Dad. When we grew up, we left them and only returned when we needed something or when we were in trouble. No matter what, our parents would always be there to give everything to make us happy. You might think that the boy had been cruel to the tree BUT that is how all of us are treating our parents. Love our parents.  -----  Seems like Friendster got a lot of such stories. Really very meaningful... :D

      Just came home since this morning.   Waste $4+ on cab just to get to school cuz Victor hurried me. He's one funny guy. Full of funny malays and such. Did manage to completed my proposal and hand it up on time with the approval of the teacher. So happy.   Didnt talk too much with Jasmine and Cecily... Me too&nbsp;shy le... :P   Well, I hate some people in my class. They're rather plastic. I hate fakies.   After school went to Tampines Central with Daniel. Today we are mad. We went around calling people names and such. We are laughing away like hysterical bitches and we kept eating. Hahaz!!! I guess sometimes my laughter can get loud at time bahz... Sure attract a lot of unwanted attention de lorhz.  Finally I'm using some Concession for my EZ Link.   Phrase I get went I went up to bus? Pass Usage. Have a Nice Day.  Phrase I get went I went down? Pass Usage. Have a Nice Day.  That's pretty absurd.  -----  Your sms to me are very important de lorhz, so keep them flooding in ya?

      A girl and guy were speeding over 100 mph on the road...   Girl: Slow down. Im scared.  Guy: No this is fun.  Girl: No its not. Please, its too scary!  Guy: Then tell me u Love me.  Girl:Ok, I Love u. Slow down!  Guy: Now give me a BIG hug.  *Girl hugs him*  Guy: Can u take my helmet off & put it on? Its buggin me.   In the paper the next day:  A motorcycle had crashed into a building because of break failure. 2 ppl were on it but only 1 survived.   The truth was that halfway down the road, the guy realized that his breaks broke, but he didn't want 2 let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she Loved him & felt her hug 1 last time, then had her wear his helmet so that she would live even though it meant that he would die.  -----  Normally, it would be 'short and sweet', but for this case, this story is short and bitter. Hahaz!!! Quite touching. Have seen this quite a number of time before in Friendster. Now I seen it again, so post it for fun lorhz. I haven't sleep lehz. Shit!   Must go sleep now. Got to wake up at 7 tomorrow.   Night. Night to you too.   &nbsp;

      :) I'm happy (:   Quite...   Just sort of completed my proposal le. Though it shall be quite unsightly. Only left a bit of printing and binding. Tomorrow, I'm going to pass it up.   I've decided. I don't wish to care about what people think about me anymore. I'm going to do what I like. No one is stopping me. I don't like my class. Argh... I'm sick of my class. IISO project, I'm alone? Even Victor put me aeroplane. What a 'friend'. Now I'm really alone le. With those pesky indians. Fuck you all. Black like charcoal, stupid like amoeba, uglier than Medusa, smelly like shit. If really I cant join Cecily's group, I will not join the indians's. I rather do it alone. Without you people stealing my credit. It will be tough, but I'll feel happier.   Enough about these.   Im meeting you on Saturday le... You finally replied my SMS. If I didnt told you I'm sick, I guess I would be still waiting and waiting and waiting... East Coast for us. I cant wake. :)   I guess I'm going to sleep soon. Plans for now? Packed my bag, clear my room, then go to sleep. Need to wake up early tomorrow. What time should I reach school? 9 am. It's so boring.   Plans for tomorrow? Print and bind and complete my proposal. It will be a breeze. I hope. Might talk with Jasmine and Cecily more. They are so friendly. Cannot be too shy le. It might fuck people up at times. Didn't call Kor back. What the fuck am I doing? School is making me sick. I need to study. Argh...   P.S   Remove my links already. Done a bit of clearing up on my blog.   Night.

      Today no school worz... Cuz I didnt go... Must concentrate on proposal... Here how my plans go...  Today -     Complete the proposal.&nbsp;  Complete my navigation diagram.  Save everything in Yahoo Briefcase.  Then find which pages of my reference book to photocopy. Then go photocopy lorhz.    Tomorrow -     Download everything from Yahoo Briefcase.  Print them out.  Bind everything up   Hand it up.   Be happy.     2 hours to complete the last part tomorrow only. Dont know got enough time mahz. Very sianz. Actually should just take away the Be Happy part. Cuz after handing in, my proposal might not get high score and I need to stress myself to do the actual project.   This weekend lehz? Might go out with him. Maybe only. Chance are slim. If not. I will be studying. I wouldnt want to fail. I believe Im quite far behind in my class. Shit... Thanks to my skipping of lecture here and there... Then today I skipped a 2 hours lab lesson. What the hell...  School is so stress... I dont realy understand what I'm learning. Even if I go to lecture, I will still be having this problem.   Life sucks.   &nbsp;

        It was first day of the mid-year exams, therefore i finished school a little earlier, i called him,  :Hey, i finished school earlier today, would you come by and pick me up?  :Alright, give me 5 minutes.  :5 minutes? But my school is just beside your house.  :I need to get ready.  :Alright, make it fast then.  2pm in the afternoon, the sun is extremely hot, I stood under a shaded tree and fan myself.  Although it doesn't make much of a difference, it was better that I fanned.  5 minutes have passed, he's still not shown up, I was a lil' unhappy while looking at my watch.  10 minutes and he's still not here....couldn't be that he was met with an accident?  15 minutes passed, he finally shown up.  :Why are you so late?  He wasn't even a lil' bothered: Nahz, was watching TV.  :What?! TV?! Why don't you sleep, bathe and eat before you come down then?  I haven't got anything else to say for that, didn't take the helmet he handed me but stood there and stared at him.  :Sorry.  This was the first time he said sorry to me...  He is an egoistical person all along and has never once apologised to a girl.  I looked at him, Alright, took the helmet and let him sent me home.  He is always acting like this, no explanations,  no friction, no quarrels .  The only thing he does is to apologise. To me, somethings can't be settled with a sorry.  I would  never go on asking  after everytime he apologises.  He told me, that was the first time he said sorry to a girl.  Although it take courage to admit mistakes, he never once correct his mistakes.  Saying sorry became a word to  shut me up instead .  Tears flowed down my cheek on the 59th time he apologised.  I dropped my head: you don't ever need to say sorry to me again.   If you can never change, then don't let me keep giving you chances again and again hoping and believing that you would change each time.   He held me lightly, and said the 60th sorry.  Even then, he did not change, and there was no explanation whatsoever.  I began to worry if there was something he was keeping from me.  :What's wrong with you these few days?  :Nothing.  :Then why are you acting so strange?  :I am not.  :What can you say other than this answer?  :Do you know I'm very woried, very insecure,   do you treat me as your girlfriend?   :I'm sorry...  :I don't want to hear you say sorry again.  I put down the phone and he did not call back.  He doesn't even care about me. Maybe we should....break up.  ....this was the 99th time he said sorry...  From that day onwards, I never once called me or went to look for him.  Sometimes I get an anonymous phonecall  but everytime I said hello, it was dead, i think it's a call from him, but why don't he speak up?  After one month have passed, I couldn't contain the feelings I still have for him anymore and went to his school to find him.  I went outside his classroom and looked around, but there was no sign of him.  :excuse me, is XOXO here today?  :I'm afraid he already stopped schooling.  :Huh? Why? When was that?  :He hasn't been in school for a month already.  :Oh erms...thanks.  One month....not in school for one month...why is that so? I stumbled home.  Called his hp: Sorry the caller is currently unavailable, please leave your message after the tone....  I put down the phone, and called his house next, but there was no answer.  How can it be? The whole family migrated?  It seems as though he has already disappeared from the face on the earth leaving not even a single trace.  I couldn't find him....just as I was feeling distraughted, the phone suddenly sounded, it was my friend.  He was one of his brothers and also my good friend.  :Hey, what have you been doing? XOXO is in hospital.  :REALLY? WHAT HAPPENED?  :Oh he is in ZZ hospital, the one you stayed in last time.  :I'll be right there.  I used the fastest speed my legs could carry and when I reached the hospital I saw that his parents were already there.  I asked them for the room number and flew across the hall.  He was lying on bed, looking at me, not saying a word, not moving a muscle,  :Hey, what happened to you? Why didn't you contact me?  He did not answer, and used the same stare on me again.  :Come on answer me...why don't you speak?  A tear flowed down the side of his eye, and it looked as though he used the greatest amount of strength that he could master to say...  :I'm...sorry...  After that, his eyes went shut.  :Hey, don't fool around alright...why say sorry to me?  :Don't say sorry to me....please wake up....answer me please.  I wept and fell down on the side of his bed, pulling his shirt I cried out..  :Why do you have to apologise? Why don't you give me an explanation instead?  :I won't forgive you, wake up, saying sorry is no use...  :If you don't wake up I'll never ever forgive you in this lifetime, please I beg of you..open your eyes.....  That was the 100th sorry  A group of medical staff, doctors, nurses pulled me away and tried to revive him. I had no strength to stand up...  My mind was a blank.... my eyes could only see a sea of black.  He did not leave this world...I merely lost the chance to touch him anymore.  But he would appear in my dreams sometimes, telling me how he was doing.  He's still accompaning me, still alive, in my heart.  would still laugh at my silliness, and call me his darling....just that...he never apologise to me anymore.  After a month, his mom came to look for me, and gave me a box...inside was  a 100 photographs, everyone had a story behind them..the reasons why he made me angry.  The first time, my dear, I did not purposely arrive late to pick you up.  I know this excuse is really lame, but I didn't have the heart to tell you the truth then,  before I stepped out of the house, I felt a pain in my chest, but I still made it a point to meet you, please forgive me?  The second time, my dear, I...  The third time, my dear, I...  The 100th time, my dear, I didn't mean to leave you alone in this world,  It had to be so because God did not give me the chance to say I Love You for this lifetime of mine, and to put the ring on your finger....  You are the first girl I apologised to.  And also the first girl I want to be with for the rest of my life...  Forgive me for not able to bring you happiness but I have thus become your angel, always looking out for you...  Looking at you while you find your happiness...promise me...don't shed a tear...  I don't want to see you weep like this for me, I Love You ~XOXO  How can I not cry? What you said was just too impossible.  The last photograph was of him in the hospital,  Although he was skinny, the smile on his face was bright as ever.  His face was white and yet he tried his best to give his last smile on the last photo, the 100th.   At the time when he needed me the most, I wasn't with him.  :I'm sorry.   I held the photo tightly and cried for us.....

      Lame title, I know. I always doesnt have good title for my blog posting de... So dont mind me lorhz...   Went to school today for 12 lesson de lecture then all the way to 4 de other classes. Didnt really enjoy myself today (Who will enjoy lesson that you DONT understand?) but at least some interesting happening lorhz... My group of friends hate a lecturerer so much cuz he teach us shit and nothing but shit. That bald head fucker. He stinks. Keep repeating himself when we told him we dont understand and ended up we more blur... Ass face... What's more he is teaching us our most important de subject de lehz!!! Jave MOBILE Programming. MOBILE lehz! The blood of my course. What the hell! Anyway, Jiahao's comments on him really is funny. Hahaz.   After class, went to dinner with Xinhui, Darius (Not the NS one :P) and Collin. What the hell. ELLIN was there. Darius DARE bring that skank together. That ass. How dare! didnt he know me and that skank got something before? That slut. Rebonded her hair and ended up looking like a prostitude or rather a whore. Went to design school and bought western food. Nice nice food. Chat with Xinhui about her plans for the future. 3 years later and she's going to the States to study... Hiaz... F Bu 5 gonna miss you... i didnt really take note of that skank during the whole time cuz I just ignore her. Wanxin sms me asking us to meet her for dinner after that so me and Xinhui agree to go another round of food so off we went to meet Wanxin lorhz. Saw her best friend, quite pretty and humorous. Wanxin was totally a joke cuz we make a tease out of her butt! :P Kewl stuff!  After that, all of them got their own CCA so I went home. How dare I ask Vincent out and he reject again. Angry so later we ended the call unhappily. Went to Tampines Mall alone, bought Landy Wen's de album which I'm listening to now. She turn into so pretty lorhz. Later I'll post her picture up. :)  Meet Daniel when I called him since he was in the vincinity. Went for some food and later went home.   Oh ya! I forgotten that I seen my BEST pal during my primary school days in TP! I think he did not see me... Seen him twice in TP. Later seen him again in T Mall but he didnt see me (Or at least I hope it is this way cuz how can he ignore me! I wouldnt say hi first de cuz I am not the kind lorhz). Anyway, still the same ol Gareth. Later see if got time I shall go Friendster and see can search him mahz...   Darius arhz Darius, you take care in your camp larhz. So late still not yet have dinner yet.  Hiaz... Im so sianz. Project de proposal are due in about a weeks' time. Argh!

SMS with Darius mahz... Then this morning I wake up ma shang look for my phone and see got his sms mahz... And so coincidence ma shang got sms coming in... Hahaz...  Anyway, both of us didnt sleep well and we fall asleep while waiting for each other sms... Hahaz...  Im busily munching on my Coco Krunch... And doing basically nothing. Later I would have lesson from 12 to 4... What the hell... Damn boring.    I also discover that every morning I wake up got a basic routine. Wake up, look at phone then the time, then turn on computer, then went to Gunbound website check my stats, then over to some other website check WWE de new, then over to check WWE Card Games de news, then went to my email inbox then over to blog. Hahaz... I should actually include the stupid thing call 'Ole' into my routine cuz the Ole is something like a bulletin board for TP to give us news or what. How lame...  I got a feeling my studies is piling up and a very sick feeling that my handphone bill is gonna cost a bomb... Oh fuck... >.<

      断点 张敬轩   静静地陪你走了好远好远  连眼睛红了都没有发现  听着你说你现在的改变  看着我依然最爱你的笑脸  这条旧路依然没有改变  以往的每次路过都是晴天  想起我们有过的从前  泪水就一点一点开始蔓延   我转过我的脸 不让你看见  深藏的暗涌已经越来越明显  过完了今天 就不要再见面  我害怕每天醒来想你好几遍   我吻过你的脸 你双手曾在我的双肩  感觉有那么甜 我那么依恋  每当我闭上眼 我总是可以看见  失信的诺言全部都会实现  我吻过你的脸 你已经不在我的身边 (虽然你不在我的身边)  我还是祝福你过得好一点  短开的感情线 我不要做断点  只想在睡前 再听见你的 蜜语甜言  -----  Wahz!!! This song very sad lorhz... But a very nice song to sing... I know this song very old liaoz larhz... But also can listen right? So please try to get to listen to this song lehz... You wouldnt regret it de... :)

      Well... The day is good. At least for him. He went shopping and still have a company dinner later... Guess he wouldnt be reaching home that early.  Met up with Victor in school at around 3. Late for an hour. I cant believe that school's lab are FULL. What the hell... Much people lorhz. My objective is to go scan something for my school project. How dare those computer are all occupied. So went changing lab.   But something happen. Neither my friend or me knows how to operate a scanner. I was like scanning happily then the result is not what I desire. What shit.   Decide not to scan in school. Called up Lishen and ask if his scanner is still working and such so I could like go his house scan and thus he can also help me in it. Was on phone with Wanxin the whole afternoon or so. Decide to meet up for dinner after that.   Then called up Xinhui and she happily still in school doing project. She asked me for help in settling up a tag board for her blog. I went all the way from my school bus stop to business school and look for her in the lab. Manage to help much. But I dont what shit I did and almost ruin her blog. So careless of me.  Late for like 10 minutes when we went meeting with Wan Wan aka Wanxin. Have sudden craving for Pastamania so they all agree lorhz to eat there. Was pretty hungry cuz I didnt ate anything since I woke up. While waiting to eat. He sms me. My mind was on him and the sms. Wondering what he's doing and such. He then called. That didnt help much. Went to arcade and how dare Wanwan and Xinhui dare let me play what Para Para. So no face lorhz... Also play some House of Dead or something then so much fun lorhz... Wanwan didnt play but she scream like she's inside. SOOOO CUTE~ Have much fun larhz...  But then...   I'm so fake. Acting all so happy for alot of times today when my mind is on the other side of Singapore. Thinking of him.   I've so many feelings bottled inside me the whole day.   Cold and Hot. Silent and Noisy. Like or Love?  Sometimes I just wish that my friends are always beside me.

      So tired... Cant believe I slept for 4 hours. 12 to 4. How dare. I was awaken involunterily. My stupid computer was making the fucking noise again. The fan is stopping and the sound starts... Damn irritating. Cannot help it so must go and switch off the PC. Cant imagine what will happen if the motherboard is overheated or something.  Am on a diet. Didnt ate anything in the morning and afternoon. Only ate my dinner. Seems like everything is going well. Cannot be lure by foods again. This is the time to be on diet for me because I'm broke. So I'm actually hitting 2 birds with 1 stone.  I must get my weight down. I must. Cuz it's for someone lorhz... :D Shall slim down to 60KG. Hiaz... Plan is to eat a little bit for breakfast. Dont eat anything for lunch and eat lesser than average for dinner. Maybe I'm going for some runs also. Cardio exercise will helps. :D  Plans for tomorrow? Go back to school. To scan some stupid pictures for my NMM project. Sickening. Also got to return all my library books. Is so troublesome.  just recieved word that my new computer will arrive in 3 days. Cant wait for the new computer to arrive. No more lousy computer for me.   :: 我不相信 都动了感情却到不了 爱情 那么贴心却进不了 心底 :: :: 你能不能快一点决定 对我说我爱你 ::

      WOW!!! I never regret going to the event.   The Fireworks were amazing... I can still vividly remember the whole thing... Meet up with Patrick before Kenneth first.   We walk around looking for the place. After that Kenneth arrived. Went eating. KFC. Saw some freaking Indians. They stinks. I saw them ordering food and they keep requesting that soft drink dont want ice and what only want the biggest chicken. They have totally no face at all.  Was quite happy to meet Kenneth larhz. Some catching on about what's happening and such.   There is a theme park near the event. Try one of the ride. It was quite fun. Fast and exciting lorhz. Some fast technp music and spinning action.  Never did I know that we need to queue to get in the event until i call Vincent up. He sort of make me angry today. Shant go in details larhz... Saw 1 very familar girl. She and her friends keep looking at my direction and was like talking about me. I guess she remember me too. Dont know why I know her face only but still I'm not sure if she's my primary school friend or what. Nevetheless, queuing was fast and quite fun. Some people went selling this pen which will flash light. Then we decide to buy it.  Went in. Sat waiting for 2 hours plus. The thingy was postpone from 9 to 9.30. Damn it. The whole stage was like very well done and the screen was playing MVs all the time to keep us occupied. Mostly is Energy's and SHE's one. Quite good lorhz. Though the wait was long and there's this guy who keep sitting with his leg open and that really irritates me.  Was like joking and chatting around. At 8.30, the Fireworks starts. It was DAMN NICE. How I wish to see it again... Maybe next year bahz... :D Hopefully someone will be by my side by that time. :D  Finally the thingy starts, dont really remember much cuz I dont feel like remember it larhz. Just remember about Toro's part. He's still as good looking and kawaii!!! So huggable de lorhz... He sang pratically every song in the Xue Tian Shi OST and he sang 'Give It Up'. One of the newest song of his. Later he sang a new song not yet broadcast anywhere with Yan Xing Shu. Quite nice. Find that Toro actually have a great body worz... :P  Yan Xing Shu is ok. No comments. K-One is ok. They sang well. They did manage to impress me. R & B is ok too. New band named TaiChi is absurd. All guys and their specialty is GongFu. They did impressive jumps and such. They really impress me besides for their name. All of their name starts with the word 'Tai'. What the hell...  Cyndi is good. Yue Guang was the song I always wanted her to sing live. She did sang it and it was good. Her 'Dang Ni' dont know for what reason make me cry. All because of my ex larhz.   Didnt watch 5566 cuz I ran out after I find myself crying. What the fuck... Kenneth and Patrick follow suit. Went home taking the last train.  By the way, my HP is siaoz onez... On and off service.   I'm tired le...

      断点 张敬轩  静静地陪你走了好远好远  连眼睛红了都没有发现  听着你说你现在的改变  看着我依然最爱你的笑脸  这条旧路依然没有改变  以往的每次路过都是晴天  想起我们有过的从前  泪水就一点一点开始蔓延   我转过我的脸 不让你看见  深藏的暗涌已经越来越明显  过完了今天 就不要再见面  我害怕每天醒来想你好几遍   我吻过你的脸 你双手曾在我的双肩  感觉有那么甜 我那么依恋  每当我闭上眼 我总是可以看见  失信的诺言全部都会实现  我吻过你的脸 你已经不在我的身边 (虽然你不在我的身边)  我还是祝福你过得好一点  短开的感情线 我不要做断点  只想在睡前 再听见你的 蜜语甜言  -----  What shit am I doing? I've post this song before. But this song is playing and playing in my Winamp. I'm so shit.  This song reflect what I'm feeling now. Shit shit shit.  I'm so stupid. I should have forgotten about my ex. Why call me? My mood keep flatuating today and yesterday. Oh shit.   So what if you're much more good looking? So what if you got a new boyfriend? I dont wanna know.   Treat me like you dont know me. Dont ask me to message you anymore. This is all over.  But deep down inside. I'm not feeling this way. I dont wanna end all these. I cant forget. I cant do ANYTHING.   Tears are dried. Feelings are gone. But why cant I forget you? Why? just when I'm about to forget you, you called.   Shit everything. I'm going to sleep. I need to sleep. My world is fuck up.   I thought we can remain friends but I dont want it this way.   I sucks. I should have delete you from my Friendster. The pictures keep revolving around my mind.   Why why why.   I'm in a fucking daze now.   Where is all my friends? I have my friends. I dont need you.   Oh fuck. What's with me? I'm going to bed.

      My ex called. After 2 months since my ex last called. Attached. Got a boyfriend already.  Was waiting for the boyfriend to call. Ask how am I and such. I ask about my ex too. Quite happy for my ex. Told me to look at the boyfriend picture in Friendster. Hahaz! You look great with your new hairstyle. Your boyfriend looks cute. :)  But I feel that... We're just like 最熟悉的陌生人.  Really surprised. Damn surprised. About everything. Anything. Nothing at all.

      一样的夏天 孙燕姿  窗外的雨 刚刚停 午后气息 浓浓地 才散去  迷迷糊糊 张开眼 刚刚的梦 我似乎 在瞬间 看见你  Oh My God 已经... 不知多久没想起 Oh~ Oh~   我淡淡地 想着你 那年夏天 最后的 那一天  你轻轻的唱着歌 未曾感受 的温柔 模糊我的双眼  终于也可以 开始一个人看明天   Oh~ 你放下我 走向前  Oh 不见 不见了你给的回忆 Oh~  为什么 Oh~ 曾经深刻的 消失了  没有原因 我的心 已经 没有 想起你的空隙  Oh I... 没想起不是忘记  Oh I... 没想起你是平静  想起了你...  是想起那样一个夏天   -----  Listened to this song once in 933 once and I've fallen in love with this song. This song is in Sun Yanzi's Leave album. Long le bahz. This song really nice. Especially the melody.  Sort of can make you cry but at he same time very soothing. Lyric nicey nicey. :D  I've long forgotten about my ex le. So this song isn't affecting me much. :D  Cheers~

      I think there's alot of my blog that start with the title 'Hiaz...' de. cuz life is really boring mahz... Especially when studying is part of it.  I found out that I blog much. I can one day blog alot of nonsense de. Dont know why. Anyway...  Today sucks. At least till now. Today test was NMM, Network Multimedia. Shit the subject. Thought that it will be damn easy. What the hell lorhz... The paper 15 pages lehz! And also some part is like 'how to do? thought this part is suppose to be in the lab or the project thingy'. What the hell lorhz. I guess this subject I also hardly pass de. Borderline fail or worse. I hate it. I hate this semester. All hard subjects.  How dare I shall whine about one thing. That Victor. How dare he! Dont know why he carry a hp for what? Happily dont pick up phonecall and seldom sms. Save money until like that. I reached school early today and wanted to meet him de then he happily never pick up phone and happily never reply my sms. What the hell. I guess he know that I'm quite pissed off at him. How dare.  After the test, went eating with him. How dare he suggest to eat. As you know, I need to save money mahz. Then he happily tell me go eat. Then I kena 'lured' mahz and cannot controlled myself so I eat lorhz. Then then then... I happily eat alot alot. What the hell. I'm trying to save money and trying to lose weight lehz... What the hell!  Sms Vincent and ask him how's he's doing and such. Called Willy for fun and he happily invited me to go out today. Still thinking lorhz. Need to waste money lehz. And quite tired now.  No sms from Donkey... 2 days le...  Anthemis, what should I do now... Argh...

      Argh...  Today's test was horrible. Couldnt wake Cecily up for the tests today so I've to blame myself thus I decided to wait for her in school for the IISO test. She couldnt hire any taxi and she was already late for the test. I reach school at 9.10 am. Test start at 9.30 am. She arrived at 10+.  No need to take le. Sure go in kena kick out de. Went eating with Cecily's and her friends. After that, Jasmine invited us to study with her and her boyfriend. Went alone. Cecily's got to meet more friends.  Jasmine's boyfriend seems to dont like me much. I wonder why. Maybe he think I'm gonna snatch Jasmine away? I really can feel that he doesnt like me that much.  I called Victor. Study study study. All of them are studying. I've got no mood. Too tired le. Lie on the bench and then I fall asleep. What the hell. I slept for 1 hour. I did told you people that I slept 2 hours the night before, didnt I.  Didnt touch much of C Maths. Touched the very very basic only.  The test was easy. Easy for others but not for me. I can see that the questions are easy. But then due to my laziness, I can only barely pass the exam. Maybe borderline fail.  Better than IISO, ZERO.  Went eating desert with Daniel at Tampines Mall again and saw one of our ex-teacher, Mr Yuan. What a shit face.  Might go sleep soon. What about my NMM? Hiaz...  Donkey, I miss you alot. How you doing now? Hiaz...

      Slept for 2 hours plus only.  The whole night playing games with Cecily. Originally, our plan was to mugged for today's tests but don't know for what reason, we ended up playing lot of MSN games. Play and slack till quite late. 4 plus.  Basically, I've only studied IISO Chapter 1 and 20% of Chapter 3. C Maths? Haven't touch. Decide to revise it during the 4 hours breaks later.  It's so cold now. Damn cold. Bad omen to my term tests today? Ya, I know. I couldnt possibly passed today's test.

      Out of the sudden, Daniel ring me up and we thus have a conference phone call with Lishen, him and me. And finally Patrick.  Talk and discuss lotsa things before we get into details of studying. Airport. We'll be studying at airport. Lishen isn't going for dont know what reason.  Meet up with them, walk around and take a look at my working place last time.  Saw a new Indian lady doing Mary's job. Where the hell is Mary? She quitted? Saw some Joyce doing clearance. She deserve it. Fancy her always requesting to do cashier. Saw the always coquettish Alice. Shaking her butt all over Lavazza. Wei jie too, he's doing what I'm doing a few months ago. Subway. Saw my Subway manager also. That arrogant slut. Argh...  Someone saw me. The overall manager in charge. He saw me. That fatso.  Didnt see the backstabber Glenn anyway. Hope he's dead.  Anyway, study for 4 hours on a single chapter on IISO. What the hell!!! Didnt brought my A Maths Testbook so i cant study it. What the hell!!!  Gonna stay up and not sleeping tonight to continue my revision. Term tests are like major exams now. Argh!!! I dont wanna fail any of my subjects.  Where the hell is my Tag Board? Argh!!!  Why didnt Donkey reply my sms. Miss Donkey alot alot. Donkey smsed me to study hard this afternoon. I got to listen. That's my motivation. :D  Donkey, I love you!!! :D

      Woke up at 12 noon. Immediately went to see my HP. Hoping to see a sms from Donkey.  But as always. No.  Instead I recieved a rather absurd sms from Daniel: 'Gan sleep long?'  What the hell larhz... I sleep for 8 hours only lehz... Still not enough.  Sms Donkey and greet him good morning and such. Told him that today is studying day for me. He actually replied and told me to study hard worz!!! So happy!!!  Went online for a bit before Donkey came online. Didnt talk to me. I waited for a bit before I initiate a conversation. Once I say hi or something like that, he told me he need to go off le. Then go off immediately.  Hiaz...  Wonder where he is now... Got no mood to study.  Still waiting for your sms.

      From now on, I'm gonna call that Person, Donkey. Cuz that's his nick.  Wake up at around 12 plus. I sleep alot. Really alot. Dont know why. Message Donkey good morning and such. Then went surfing net. At 2 plus or so, went SMS Donkey to meet up. Deal. Somerset MRT at 4.30.  Was late 1 hour plus cuz of my GunBound stuff. Panic and rush to meet Donkey. I feel so guilthy... Letting Donkey wait... Ended up Donkey's late also. Donkey reach at around 5 but still I'm late. For 30 minutes... :P  Reach the station and message Donkey, he never reply. Called Donkey. Never pick up.Thought that Donkey's angry le...  Then walked around Somerset. Saw my old working place. that damned OG. Still having that 'Moving Out Sale'. Move so long still got the 'Sale'. Dare cheat people. Knew quite a lot of good friends in OG though. :D  I was really sad. Cuz Donkey ignored me mahz... Went walking for 15 minutes to HMV before sms Donkey and told him of my location. He finnally reply and say he's coming for me.  Met up. Went eating. Donkey's cute. Donkey's nice. Didn't talk too much to him today... Ending up meeting him for 2 hours or lesser then he went to meet another of his group of friends. After he bid me farewell, I was like crying. Tears dropped. I wonder why.  Message Sheng Cai, telling him. He really understand me. :D  He's a very good friend. :)  Meet up with Xinhui and Wanxin after that. Saw some slutty Pearllyn. That slut. Went Swensen to eat. I do spent alot... Got to control my expenses le. Then talk around and play around then go home. I really like Wanxin and Xinhui. Cuz they are my super good friends mahz.  Need to study. Tests start this Monday.  I really like Donkey. But... Hiaz...  I think there's no chance lorhz...
