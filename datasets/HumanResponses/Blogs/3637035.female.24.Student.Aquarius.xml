      Well, I don't know what to say. This weekend was shitty/sweet. Friday night we went to the Mardi Gras parade. Our stupid town council obviously doesn't know what Mardi Gras celebrations are, because Mardi Gras has absolutely nothing to do with Canada Day. So, anyway, its a parade that symbolizes Mardi Gras celebrations down in the states. So, whatever. Usually this is how it happens each year. Friday night-Mardi Gras parade, beer tents, streets blocked off, big party downtown. Saturday-Carnival, stuff for the kids/family, fun, games, activities, etc... Nighttime, more beer tents, live bands, street dance, whatever... Sunday-Repeat of Saturday daytime activities. So, cool. Well, I guess after the parade (and we had a wonderful time at the parade) A bunch of black guys went downtown and decided they wanted to start up some shit. One thing led to another, people got hurt, someone got stabbed, and just all hell broke loose. So, they went and cancelled the Street Dance and everything for Saturday night.  Now, I do know some of the black guys, and a lot of them came from South African places on immigration. This weekend was meant to be Canada Day Celebrations. I think that the guys that started it ought to be deported, or SOMETHING. They ruined it for a lot of people. One time, I met up with a guy who went to jail for 30 days and had to pay a hefty fine for disrespecting Canadian Currency. He was caught trying to smash the middle out of the Two-nie. So, if he got in that much trouble for fucking with Canadian Currency, shouldn't these assholes get in A LOT of shit for ruining Canada Day Celebrations. Ok, so maybe deportation is a bit harsh. But what a disrespect to this country! Our whole town waits every year for the Street Dance to roll around! And because of these stupid assholes, it got called off? I dunno... My niece got punched in the face by one of them. They were literally trying to start a riot. They were beating up on girls, guys, you name it, and they were also throwing around racial slurs (white trash, white honky bitch, etc) What the fuck is that shit????  So, went to my brother and sister inlaws on Saturday night instead for summore karaoke. Had a great time. Then we all got drunk, and I did something incredibly stupid. I actually really feel bad for it. There was a whole shitload of us there, including Kev and Mel. Well, they broke up but have a baby together that's under a year old. Well, since the split, Kev has found himself a new woman. She kept phoning and phoning and phoning Jim and Marlene's to try and talk to Kevin. In other words, she was being an obsessive freak. So, I dunno, I was loaded, I picked up the phone, and told her that Kevin and Melissa were a family again, and to fuck off and stop phoning. Kevin HAS in fact been fucking Melissa still, and I know he still loves her. I think this new girl is just a space fill in, so whatever. I was only saying what people were telling me to say. I am not the type of person to start shit like that anymore. Well I guess the girlfriend went and called Kev this morning and told him what I'd said to her (at Marlene's coaching) Hell, I dunno. I was drunk. Kev went over to Marlene's and just LOST IT. Now, I heard 2 different stories. Marlene and everyone said that Marlene took her part of the responsibility, and admitted that she told me to say what I said and all that, and that I had no idea what in the hell was going on. But, Kevin called me to ream me out, but before he did, I told him number one that I was extremely sorry for what I had done, and number two that I accepted full responsibility for it. Being drunk, in my eyes is no excuse to do that. I don't even know the girl. So, pretty much right away, he was cool with me. He said that he was just totally blown away by the fact that I would do such a thing to him. He also told me that Marlene put the whole thing on me. I don't know. The 'Old' Marlene might have, but we're dealing with a 'New' Marlene here. She's not the rotten bitch that she used to be. She's changed a lot. He told me though that he accepted my apology and he knew that Marlene had probably instigated it. So, it's all over with now. Everyone's friends again, and all that.  I have this friend called Matt.  Well, this sorta dates back to when my friend Jeff came out of the closet. I don't know if I've posted this already, but I was telling Matt that Jeff finally had come out of the closet. So, Matt says to me "Yeah well that's good. I think that your a lesbian too". Um, yea ok. So, what do I do? I defend myself. "I'm not a fucking lesbian. But, while we're on the topic, I've had my thoughts about your sexual orientation as well". That was last week. That was the only comment I made to him, and I can't believe it... He's STILL carrying it on. He got SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO offended by that it wasn't even funny. He came over here yesterday and just kept going on and on and on and on and on and on and on... Fuck, it was enough to drive me nuts. And this is a 44 year old man we're talking about here. Then today, he sends me an email bitching at me AGAIN for it. I couldn't believe it. He got so fucking offended. So, I wrote him back and basically said something along the lines of him being able to dish it out, but can't take it in return. He's so childish. I am one of the only people that puts up with his shit. He talks behind everyone's back (probably mine too) he treats people like shit, he appears to have a real hatred on for women... i could go on and on. I dunno... I think he's a misanthrope! That's what I think. But, I'm so close to just telling him to fuck right off, because I almost can't stand his shitty attitude anymore. His 20 year marriage fell apart, and now it's like he's blaming the rest of the world for it. He has no intention of taking responsibility for anything. He tries to get dates with women, but when he does do it, they brush him off, because after the first meeting, his true colors come out. And I've tried to open his eyes to it, but he keeps them closed. He blames the women for not wanting anything to do with him. He once told me he's 'picky'. He's not picky. He's an asshole that hates the world and everyone in it, and wants everyone to take responsibility for his actions. I dunno, I gotta go. I'm starting to get mad just thinking about it. I know this though. I want to try and better myself, have fun in life with my kids, my man, get done school all that kinda stuff, and its people like that that bring me down.  Oh and stupid bitchface Lorreen moved out yesterday. When I'm really bored one night, I'll write all about her. ;)

      Well, I did it. I'm so sick of talkin' shit that I'm gonna do this with my life and do that with my life. I am intelligent, but have no Grade 12 Diploma to prove it. So, I took initiative. I went to the school tonight to enroll in the Learn @ Home Program. I'm beginning English. Thing is though, I thought I had 17 credits left to complete my Grade 12, and because of my age, and length of time I've been out of school, it isn't so. I in fact, so far, only have 6 to get. So coooooool So, I could be graduating next June. So far, I qualify for 10 maturity credits, but because I have 2 kids and have maintained a household and other 'life' experiences, I could qualify for the maximum...which is 12. So, I have between 4-6 credits to get, THEN I'M DONE FOR GOOD. That's it for today.

      Well, its official. Jeff has finally come out of the closet. Yeppers! I asked him if he wanted to come to the carnival this weekend (that's our yearly ritual) and sure enough, he informed me that he was going to the Pride parade. So, I came right out and asked him. And he admitted it. He apparently has a really nice boyfriend and all, so good for him. I've known, we've all known Jeff was gay all along. He is now 23 years old, I believe (maybe 22) and when I asked him if he has been gay all his life, he said he in fact was. I couldn't imagine being trapped like that. We used to ask him and tease him all the time, and he used to get right defensive. He's had girlfriends... He was trapped in a closet that he couldn't find his way out of. Now he is finally experiencing self acceptance and inner peace, and I'm so happy for him. Beck is shocked, possibly secretly devastated by his admittance, but I'm not. I'm happy for him that he, like I said, has found inner peace, and the strength to come clean with himself. Good for you Jeff! I love ya!  Maddi cut her first tooth today, thank God. Poor little thing has been teething since she was 2 months old, and it finally came through.  Tristan and I went to the grocery store today. There was a black lady in the store pushing a stroller with a baby in it about Maddi's age (around 10 months old or so) and Tristan goes up and says "Aww, what a cute little baby. I've never seen a brown baby before, but we have a white baby at home". I JUST ABOUT DIED! I was so embarassed. I just grabbed him by the hand and ran away. Geez, kids say the darndest things. Shit! I've already taught him about how people are different, and how there's people that come from different parts of the world that sometimes have a different color of skin.  Anyway, that's it for today! (If I can think of anymore, I'll edit)

      Well, sadly to say, the weekend is over yet again. I had it all planned out. I was going to go to Karaoke at the bar on Friday night, go to a party down at the harbour front on Saturday and go to my friend's Jack and Jill on Saturday night. Well, I did end up going to Karaoke on Friday night. Woke up Saturday with a hangover from the zambooka. I will only get up and sing if I've had a little bit to drink. Otherwise, I'm not ahle to gather the nerve. So, did that, it was fun. Anyway, my hangover ruined Saturday morning for me. So, I stayed in bed, took a zillion Tylenol's, then got my ass out of bed. My hunnie went over to visit his bro, and I decided that I was bored, so when Derrick called me, I told him I wanted to go over with the kids. Its only across the street. Well, so much for the Harbor Front party and the Jack and Jill. I took the kids, a lot of Derrick's family was there, and his brother and wife bought a Karaoke machine. So, that's about it. We had a big old Newfie karaoke bash. I didn't drink too much though, because I didn't want to feel like shit again.  In continuation to my little 'problem' regarding my friend that takes me for granted.... Well well well, she pissed me off again tonight. I don't know if I mentioned it in my last post or not, but she also gives out my UNLISTED phone number to guys that she has met over the web... Hasn't even met them in person yet. I've had enough guys phoning here, her work phones here, everyone phones here, and its pissing me off. Well, I was on the phone earlier tonight, and my other line beeped. So, I didn't bother answering it, because I was on a rather important phone call. I checked my voice mail after, because someone left a message. Well, here its her, calling from a payphone to tell me yet ANOTHER guy is going to be phoning her tonight at my place and would I please just take a message! Like, what the fuck do I look like a fuckin' answering service? Some guy from Ireland... or is this one from Cali, I dunno. Who knows, who cares? See, she has no phone of her own. She HAD a phone. She HAD a cell phone. But, didn't pay the bills. So, they got cut. Like, lets not misconstrew things. She was not calling me from a payphone tonight to ASK if this guy could call. She called to tell me to take a message because she had already given him my number and was expecting him to call. Nerve or what? I can't believe it! Derrick is MAD! This isn't the first time. I have 2 small kids here who don't need to be woken up in the middle of the night because of this shit. She called and informed me at 10:30pm, so obviously she told him to call at any time, because she said "He said he will call me tonight". I'm sick of it.  Anyway, aside from that, today was Father's Day. Went up to my mom's for a Father's Day dinner. It was nice. Cold salads, bbq'd burgers. Pretty delicious! Cake for dessert! Yummmmmmmmmm.  That's it!

      You know, I never realized what my dad meant when he said to me "Stop taking me for granted". I thought "Um, excuse me, but taking someone for granted means to 'use' them." I finally realized today exactly what he meant. For instance... Whenever I needed a drive somewhere (to do my groceries or whatever) I'd call on one of my parents to drop everything and take me to do my grocery shopping. I didn't realize how this might have made people feel, until I sat down today and had a long hard THINK TIME about the way I am treated, and I am continually taken for granted every single day without fail.  Taking for granted isn't the same as using in my opinion. My terms are as follows:   To 'Use' someone: Intentionally befriending somebody, being in a relationship with somebody, or holding association with somebody with the motive of 'personal gain'.    To 'Take for granted': To expect, and depend on others to pick up your pieces for you. In other words, too highly expectant of other people, and the key word here is  EXPECT    I have this friend. She continually comes to my door each and every day for the sole reason of wanting something. Either she wants to use my phone, or my computer, or she wants this or wants that. Wants wants wants. Today, however, I got extremely pissed off. Because its not the fact that she's constantly asking for shit, its the way she does it. She does it in a round-about way. She hints at things. And if you choose not to take her hints by giving in, she makes you feel like your the lowest piece of dirt on the face of the earth by crying, and carrying on and all that other crap. And if you DO give her what she's 'hinting' towards, then voila! All Her problems seem solved, and she's happy again. But if you don't give in, she pulls this depression thing, saying no one cares about her and all this other crap.   Some examples... A couple of months ago, she had no cigarettes. I certainly am having a hard enough time supporting myself and 2 children let alone someone else who makes nearly $20.00 an hour at her job. So, she came over and was 'beating around the bush' about how she had no cigarettes. I knew what she was getting at, but I didn't give in. She was hoping I would feel sorry for her and offer her a bunch of my cigarettes. So, whatever... She then startted crying and shaking and alllllllllllll this other stuff, so finally I offered her a couple cigarettes.  Same thing yesterday. Carrying on. But, when I didn't give in, she got on the phone to my mom and started crying to her how she had no money. Well, my mom is nothing to her. My mom doesn't know her that well. So, my mom suggested to her "call the welfare agency and see if they can help you until you get paid on Thursday". After that was said, my mom and her said their goodbyes, and she hung up the phone and made a face. She said "Your mom told me to go to welfare for a MEASLY 20 bucks", as if she was completely astonished with the fact that my mom never offered to help her. NERVE! To make matters worse, this person is in her mid 30's acting like this. She wants everybody to pick up her mess for her. I don't understand exactly what the problem is... She makes all that money, she pays her rent when its convenient for her, she has no cable, no phone, no cell phone anymore... All she has is all these animals to feed. Well, if you can't afford to look after yourself, why not get rid of your animals and start taking care of yourself, instead of relying on everyone else all the time.  Like, I don't mind doing favors every now and again. That's not my issue. But this person seems to be the type that if you do one little thing, it becomes expected. I've asked her for favors, but I've always repaid the favor, AND THEN SOME. Now I feel like I have an unwanted member to my family. Don't get me wrong. I like the girl, but I shouldn't be expected to pay her way. I have an income that is 10 times lower than hers... I have everything that I could want, plus I am able to feed myself, my man, and my kids adequately, and I even have enough left over each week to be able to go out for a drink. So, what's the problem? She never comes over just to see how I'm doing. Its always when she wants something. She came up here FIVE times yesterday looking for handouts. And its hard to tell someone like that to stop, because of the guilt trip you get afterwards.  I was talking to my sweetie about it, and I asked him "Can't she just appreciate the fact that we've done so much for her? Why doesn't she just go and ask for her handouts somewhere else?" And he said "No! Because people like that DON'T appreciate what you've already done for them. They only appreciate what you can KEEP doing for them!" Good point! But it's messing my life. Everytime I want to go out and spend time with my kids, she's at my door wanting something. Everytime I want to spend time with my man when he comes here after work, she's here. Like, she can't just think to herself "gee, maybe these people want to be alone for awhile". Like, my man and I were watching Runaway Bride lastnight... Late lastnight. We were finally happy that we got some time to ourselves. We were cuddling on the couch with a bowl of popcorn, and all of a sudden... a knock comes to the door. "Oh shit!" I thought, "what now".  Well, of course, it was 'you-know-who'. She comes in and starts telling me about her gas bubble in her stomache. Like, god, I care? "I really wish I had some tylenol for my pain", she says. Well, its no secret I keep a generous supply of tylenol on hand at all times. So, there was the hinting again. I just brushed it off. So, finally she comes out and says "a cigarette would be nice too". OMG!!!! Again, I shrugged it off. I mean, if you want something, ask. Stop beating around the bush. So, she comes out and says "Do you have any tylenol I could get off you?" I gave her one. I gave her a cigarette too because I knew that would be next. Like, I just don't understand. She talked to me all through the movie me and D were trying to watch.  Its ALWAYS SOMETHING. It used to be wanting to come up here and use my computer everyday for hours on end. Well, I put a stop to that quick, by telling her I got a virus in my computer and couldn't be used. So, the other night, I went into the bathroom to have a shower when she was here. She asked if she could 'play' for awhile. I said "No, because the computer is still down from that virus I got". Well, i come out of the shower and sure enough, there she is on the computer.  She started talking on chatlines through her phone, and began talking to a dozen or more guys. So, next thing I know, because she gets her phone cut off, she went and gave all her 'virtual guys' MY phone number to get a hold of her. Next thing I know, my phone's ringing at all hours of the day and night with phone calls from guys she's never met. I was PISSED.  So, there's a few examples of what I mean by being taken for granted. I am using this blog to vent my frustrations about this and other things, because I really don't want to burden all of my other friends with this crap. My advice to whoever reads this is please don't take people for granted. Because then you will find you get the same type of animousity toward you. People will only act for so long like they don't mind helping you out, but if your given an inch and you take a mile, people start really questioning your motives. I know only I can do something about this. But, it is in fact easier said than done. I do like the girl, but I mean, I think I should be able to help people out without them thinking that I constantly owe them something. Anyways, signing off for now.

      Long time since my last post. Almost a month to be exact! Fuck, that's crazy. Some really serious shit has happened lately, and I don't even know wehre to begin. So, that fucking bitch Loreen moved out of here. And in moved all D's Newfie buddies. Cool... Maybe? Would have been the 3rd of this month I suppose, that D and I had plans. Well, he decided to fuck off on me with all his buddies that live downstairs. Yep, we had the plans. We were gonna drink and all that crap, and he ended up ditching me. I hate that when I get ditched. So, whatever, yea I was pissed of course. So, we made plans for LAST Saturday, (being the 10) It was cool. We went out for dinner, and had planned on getting some drinks and just havin one of those nights. Sex... You know, all that fun shit. But, something happened. Circumstances changed a little bit. His brother (because of the CAS) isn't allowed near his kids... But, J wanted to spend some time with Mar. So, I offered to take the kids so that they could spend some time alone without the kids around. But, there was a condition. Since D and I had made plans, I wanted them to pick the kids up at around 10 or so. They agreed to that, and kept the agreement. Well, 10:30, but no biggie. D and I still had plenty of time together. But, no. D wanted to get right on the beer right away, with the kids here and everything. So, he said to me at 10 "I'm gonna go downstairs for a bit, I'll be up in an hour." Whatever. He always says that. He was treating me like shit in front of the kids when he was here. So, I said to him "Well, remember our plans. You don't be back here at 11, you ditch me again for a second&nbsp;week in a row, then fuck off, and consider yourself single". So, he said "OK, I will be back I promise" and that was that. He never came back. Not till almost 5am. I told him if he didn't come back then not to bother. So, he didn't. Until 5. What in the hell is that supposed to say to me? "Piss on ya?" I would think so. So, I told him, "Fine, I'll let you in, but I'm single now". When he came back, he&nbsp;brought back this weird guy with him. The week before (he lives in this building too) I met him, and he was 'jokingly' trying to kiss me. I'd never met him before. Truthfully I was rather creeped out by it. But anyway, when D came back last saturday at 5, this guy came with him. I was crying and everything. I was so angry, because I did in fact, after HIS nieces and nephew left, (yea HIS family, and he fucks off on ME) I spent the rest of the night by myself. So, I was upset, understandably so. So, I let the 2 of them in, so as not to make a big scene in the hallway, and D gave me one of those really nasty looks. I said to him "What, chu gonna go beat me up again?" (when D gets too loaded, he takes his temper out on me. Last year he lost it on me because I was laughing at him for falling on his ass... he almost killed me Literally) He just shook his head at me, and went to the bathroom. Then this guy he brought with him (the weird one) started talking to me at the table. He then said "I want to see you... Tomorrow night out front of the building 6:30". Um, yea ok there buddy, I thought. I was not attracted to this guy at all. I couldn't believe it. He is supposed to be one of D's best friends, doesn't know me from adam, and he wants to talk to me. Whatever, he's drunk, I thought. He'll forget about it, and I will too... I just took into consideration that the guy was loaded.  Next day, he comes over. Sober! Whispers to me "Silver Store at 8, don't wanna take a chance being meeting you out front of the building" Fuck! I thought. He remembered. So, not wanting to be mean, I showed up. Met up with my father too. And Deb. So, I told him I had to go for a beer with dad, and I would be back at the Silver at 830. And I was. So was he. We went down to the lake, and he took my hand and all he wanted was to just get to know me. And why I said what I said about D beating me up. So, we talked blah blah blah. Then we sat on a bench at the lakefront, and he started literally begging me to kiss him. I thought "Uh, no!" This guy was sooooooo not my type. I told him we could only be friends, no more no less. So, he told me to kiss him anyways and see if I felt anything lol. Unbelievable. So, whatever. I did, and I pulled away. I didn't feel anything. So, lol, he said "Try again". Still didn't feel nothing, so I suggested we go home. I promised myself forever that I wouldn't get involved in a situation like this, especially some guy that lives in my building. This is why I never did with M next door. Went home, called it a night, whatever... But then I kept thinking about him... and thinking and thinking, in fact, I couldn't stop! It was crazy. I wanted to see him again. When he hugged me, I felt warm, loved and safe, it was weird. See, when I parted with him that night, he asked me to meet him again the next night. I had no intentions. But I couldn't stop thinking about him for some really weird reason. I dunno. So, I kept on meeting up with him through the week. Just to talk and stuff. His kiss was soft and warm. We learned a bit here and there about eachother. He's&nbsp;a total romantic. He's an amazing person. True. Real. Everything. So far anyway. He started working last week, so he asked if he could get my cell number in case he works late, he wants to call me and say goodnight. He told me he can't stop thinking about me. He said a lot to me. I'll continue tomorrow, I'm getting tired.
