      It's Blog, Day 2. My, my, how you've grown, little blog! You've doubled your size overnight, from one entry to two.  Today I thought I'd write about the family reunion I just returned from at Isle of Palms, South Carolina. It was wonderful, thanks for asking. I got to see older cousins and siblings I seldom see, as well as their assorted spouses, children, girlfriends, and dogs. We had plenty of good stuff to eat and plenty of opportunities to reminisce and swap family stories, all while sitting on the screened porch of a beach house, the happiest bunch of beach bums you ever saw. We had a good mix of ages among the Leslies, Baileys, and Vogts in attendance: kids three and under, teenagers, middle aged folk, and one or two elders. Everyone except for the three-year-old slept late and no one kept a schedule. Those who wanted to shopped like mad and the rest didn't. The highlight of the event had to be Sunday afternoon when everybody gathered for a group portrait. (Hope somebody had a wide angle lens!) At max, we had about 30 people in the house. Alexandra, my three-year-old great-niece, also known as Alex or Sasha, (yes, I'm old enough to have a great niece), insisted on leading the assembly in SEVERAL renditions of the ABC song. I celebrated birthday # 41 in this place. It was the first such family gathering I can recall, and by all accounts, a rousing success.  Yet for all this gaiety, there was a note of melancholy, at least for me. My Dad is 80, Mom, 79. Dad's lung cancer is pretty far advanced. Age and chemotherapy have left him thin, pale, frail, and often confused, so different from the vigorous, take charge guy I remember from my childhood and youth. How much longer will he be around? How much longer will any of us?  It's funny,isn't it? When we are small, we believe our parents are immortal, invulnerable, and omnipotent. They have always been there and will always be there, knowing just exactly what to do in any situation. As we grow into adolescents, testing assumptions and limits, we see that our parents aren't perfect and don't know everything. At some deep level this shocks and saddens, and, perhaps, frightens us. We reject our parents (or at least pretend to). In teenage ignorance and arrogance, we assume our parents don't know anything. Yet as we mature, we realize that oftem, both we and our parents are confused, anxious, and uncertain about the right choices to make in life. We just have to do the best we can with what we've got. Mark Twain once said,"When I was 14, I thought my father didn't know anything. When I was 21, I was amazed at how much the old man had learned in seven years."  I think (and I hope) the recognition that both we and our parents are frail, fallible, human beings enables kids to forgive parents for their f laws and hangups. It's helped me. Someone who's trying to do his best despite his weaknesses is ultimately more loveable and andmirable than those seemingly perfect superheroes of our childhood anyway. I love you, Mom and Dad.

      Hi Web. It's me. Y'know, the geeky guy with glasses who was intrigued with the idea of spouting off in a place where a few million of his closest friends could read it? Yeah, that guy.  As you might guess from the title, this is my first entry, and I'm still trying this thing out. My name is Neil, I'm single, I work as a librarian in a small town, and I think about things a lot. Rather than go crazy (or be thought crazy) by talking to the furniture all the time, I thought I might start this blog and share my thoughts with you, the wonderful people of World Wide Web land. I promise I'll try and make them interesting (the thoughts, that is. As for making interesting people, you folks are on your own).  So who is this weirdo whose blog you've stumbled across, you ask? Good question. When I figure it out, I'll let you know. But if I were to choose a list of words and phrases to describe myself, it might include, in no particular order:  *Librarian  *Catholic  *Singer -- Celtic, classic country and bluegrass, hymns, old standards, Gilbert & Sullivan, you name it. (Rap sucks! Sorry, I just had to say it. I feel better now).  *Star Trek fan  *Movie buff (Netflix rocks! That was an unsolicited testimonial, and I am not a paid endorser, I swear!)  *Comic book and graphic novel newbie -- As a kid I never had much exposure to comic books. My mom never actually FORBADE me from reading comic books. It was just that I picked up a strong vibe that she thought of them as trivial, lowbrow entertainment. Now that I'm all grown up and a librarian and the library's gotten into graphic novels in a big way, I can read "Bone" and Michael Chabon's "Escapist" comics with impunity. "Collection development," don'tcha know. See, kids, turning 41 ain't all bad. If you like, call it a symptom of midlife crisis. No, I do not look like The Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons -- yet. Gimme an extra 200 pounds and hair long enough for a ponytail, and I might make it.  *Creative writer -- With the aforementioned interests in certain aspects of pop culture, I dabble in telling stories.   *Conservative -- In politics I consider myself more of a Republican than a Democrat, but I believe both parties have constituencies they have to appease and cannards and slogans they spout. Neither party has a monopoly on virtue or truth. In my personal life, I'm something of a conservative too, because I'm very cautious about change and risk. Maybe the life of the imagination is safer than dealing with (gasp!) REAL PEOPLE!  *Person with a Disability -- As you might have noticed from the photo below, I have cerebral palsy and have to use a wheelchair to get around. But you also might have noticed I put that last on my list of identifying characteristics. I don't believe in wrapping my whole identity around one aspect of myself. I'm more complex than that, and so are you. I've lived a full, rewarding life despite my physical limitations, and I have a lot of living left to do yet.  OK. I can tell by the look on your pixels. You're bored silly with the biographical blah-blah. But I hope to discourse intelligently on interests old and new in the coming days, weeks, and months. And I hope that what I have to say about my interests will be of interest to you. Ciao for now.
