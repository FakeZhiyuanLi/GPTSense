       Once Ago, None In the End   I see rock chasing money prostitutes, cruelly hounding, cruelly conditioning Them, yelping bitches tickled by the meager sparkle mounted by their honeys on their skinny fiddlers Noses thrown high, sneer casting their eyes, screwing their heads in gluttonous disappointment The glittering greed humping their eyes, howling their misled fortunes to the diamond chiseled skies While the poor boys drudge their knees and calloused hands through a gold world That teaches their wenches the value of love comes from the magnitude of a ruby, an emerald, a sapphire They cry The skimpy stones bewail only a glimpse of heaven and the giver's heart And they peer their peers with jealous eyes, whose blinkers offer a life in Shangri-La Gaudy broads riding the jeweled life, puffing and huffing about their handsome existence Unknowing of the deadly squandering of their lives till a sickly, ill time on earth A cancer spreading proudly itself to death a hollow anger angry at the only thing that cannot satisfy Conditions set upon the lifetime vows they make, that turn around empty as the golden halos peel off into steel Hideous monsters emerge from the darkened blinds of a foolish agreement the holy union made An agreement thickened by the disgusting crown of royalty they see and want and eventually hold Only to find the questions to life unspared, that leave them scouring the devil nights of pounding ecstasy And now the crunch begins They spill the streets for rushes and highs, and return the living room with smeared disguise Shaking their junked up heads as they call it a day, a day they found the transient answers that show more than what their rubies could That shine and howl the eternal vows, till death do they part, with their wills close to their hearts And they, who yearn for the charmers all yellow and cold, with stiffened hearts studded with trinkets galore Without anymore of the flooding bloody rage unstopping and floating up on rooftops stinging the wind with their sorrows Madness eats them up Banging their punches on the top of their heads in a whirl and their face holes tearing the skies with cries Harping the indifference stuffing their pores, and fury burnt upon their throbbing brains Bursting hyaenas, crumpled faces of frustration erupt the flawless night serving their trumpets of sins to the world And all at once is finally washed out and immaculately poised to face the plunging thump to the screaming streets The worldly eyes zombied and grey and tired, now feasting the cradling howling gust Stare in ready deafness, hogging the affection of the wind and savouring it for the last time Stare in lonely stone blindness from the heightened diving board honoured of a first jump The race is on and the chill digs in, whacks through the nostrils and pulls out a first retarded frightened sigh The body seeps the earth with a crunching metamorphose blow, digesting yet another unquenched stone chaser

      In the time between sleep and wake, I saw a frame frozen in time, that told me of a silly deed I made.

      I was poked by a messenger's inquisitions today, whose tidings will unfortunately be received in umbrage. I can't help but to face my eyes towards sympathy where my words get mistakenly appropriated. Words that stab my heart with rue. Words that lavish and festoon upon the chains of my past. My ties have been cleanly cloven by what I have said already. Do not rope me back with words of seduction for I do not wish anymore to kiss my recent past.  My composure sits. I express contrition. But the smarting of a vicious cycle thrusting and stinging my nerves is something I have no strength to repeat.  My remembrance of days of yore is diluted by something of a more potent capacity. A character native of my heart. A story that drifted on 5 erratic oceans, encapsulated in a bottle, braving whatever storms or calm there was to come. However, the bottle's anchored to shore and has been opened now. Storms and calm are over now. Just like your story is come to a close.  But even so if there ever was a ditty worded for you, they are merely words. No hidden message of a tryst eagerly waiting in anticipation to be decoded will be buried within. So I say, truly, let go. I have.

        The Unfinished Ballad    There is a girl whose innocence is so tender I'll bet she's the only one and there's no other She raves about a boy and craves his attention She's a cotton ball, a cloud who floats his direction This girl is simple as a beautiful creature in the world Whose only weakness is to give her all She's partly human and wholly angel And the rest of her just simply a girl  Well this boy she's been talking all about He's young and obviously not seen enough He loves her too but knows not how to love her Cos he wants to see the world, his all's just ain't enough When he makes her cry his heart dies and he's sorry He sings his lullaby for her, now she's happy But this is not enough for him for he's hungry He wants to rule the world  Now it seems that he's been superficially dreaming He feels the torrent emptiness waking But still he tries to walk along the path hither Towards the place where he finds his vigour While he's busy being blinded by his romances And other great things he's planned to do This girl still waits aside silently Till his heart flies back to her  In the midst of this burnin' confusion And his constant contradiction She grows tired of excuses he is making His words and promises seem to be breaking He flies to her and out again And leaves her standing alone again Now he sings his lullaby for her then she's happy But it's only a brief phase  Now while the world goes on rotating The sun and moon continues levitating The graveyards busk silently in the constellation And people go on living their own chapters This story of the boy and girl that I've revealed Will constantly go on in recurrance So I tell you now don't keep in heart what you listen Cos this story might not be real

       SWEET DREAMS   Nothing in nothing, it seems Might actually be something in nothing That manifests something from nothing Which really is something So this, I guess, is something That materializes from something Which initially was developed from nothing That was nothing in something So, this something Was always there in nothing That created something That multiplied into something else Hoorah!

      The scent of an angel drifts through my reminiscent graveyards. By and by, little beads of heaven will wash out the pangs that grated my heart. Cloud out whatever that boiled in me. Cloud out whatever that remains a blemish that drove my mind out into sewage recollections. I cannot help my own hands to write what i used to. But only to find the papers stained by a handwriting driven by love. Somehow, they only remain what they are now. Paper stains outlasting ironically the confessions they read.  Hunted down by my own atrocity, I know I need no more to gouge out my eyes to shroud the grief I have set upon myself. I smiled a smile that stayed too long. I smiled a murdered smile, holding back the axe with my head in the hood, picking up pieces of stones that fell along the way into the mire.  The scent of an angel has hidden itself from me where I no longer have the courage to stand up to my resolute grounds. And I cannot suffer the pains my legs receive when they trudge upon the fiery nails hell cannot even hold. And I get drunk on self pity, something that lodged into my intestines and unwilling to pass itself out, talons digging deep and stiff. Stiff from too long in limbo. And now it just decides poisoning me on self-deprecation shall more or less do the job. I get knuckled under.  Fairies leap their trips on their flutterers bounding. Spraying the emulated fragrances that cannot last long as they nose out. Skunk out. Rudely fuming hard nostril punches driving deep into a teary burn. They don't and will never meet on equal grounds. For they are merely fairies soon to wilt and crumble to sprinkle. Dissolving into an obscurity they never thought they'd end up.  An angel is unfairy. And I've wrenched her out. And I miss her...

      The scent of an angel has hidden itself from me. I smile a smile that stays too long and now it has become murdered. A smile that is murdered still smiles. But only now it is dead. Cos it's waited too long for the scent of the angel to appear again.

      My last days in Singapore have been good to me. I'll fly off with a satisfied heart, because what I have yearned for, I have been given. I didn't ask for much. So that's enough for me. At least now I know how i feel and how she feels. Now I know at least where I stand. Whatever it is, I know we have come to good grounds. Best friends? Well maybe. It probably is the best we remain this way. I wish her well...

      I seem to keep having to countdown to a moment of a lifetime my whole life. And for now, my next countdown is towards a certain part of my life where I push myself to a next level of education. But who's to know what i'm gonna do after that? The future seems rather cloudy to me.

      It's 2 days after my ORD. No sound whatsoever. Thought I'd make this moment of a lifetime to use a little lunchtime celebration. Well I didn't in the end...

      I want to live And run away from the thorned world But there's no need to hide now I'll stay and keep afloat I want to see How many skies will fall And see the angels come tumbling with damaged wings After all the search will never end How does it feel Now that you're born into this world To face a myriad ghouls That feed on your flesh Poison your stomach with acid pleasantries And leave you naked dying, Rolling in pain How does it feel?
