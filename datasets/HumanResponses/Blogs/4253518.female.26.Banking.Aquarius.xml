       There are things that you SHOULD do, things that you SHOULDN'T do and ABOVE all.... Things that you should never do but you do anyway. Things that are worth doing are NEVER easy and all that jazz. Don't let me cram all that happy crap down your throat.....things aren't easy, Life isn't easy and most days you will give up before your head leaves the pillow in the morning. (that is, if you can even get UP in the morning.)  When life beats you down, sometimes you have to change your circumstances. This seems quite logical. Got a dead-end marriage? OK, get out. Need a better job? Look around. With a smile on your face you walk in a land a job that you can use to slowly move your way up the ladder to "success". Are your kids unhappy? Take life by the horns and turn all that around. Kids just want attention and love and anyone can do that. The big things come on a regular basis.....you have to know that the parts add up to the whole. When you make one decision, it usually trickles down to all the others. I have made alot of brave decisions and I can FEEL my chest puff out with THIS sentence. The most important thing to me was love. If I didnt have a partner, didnt have the true love that I knew was right in front of my face, life seemed empty. So stamp this puppy DONE. I now have the love I've always dreamed of......but what about life? Don't all those bill collectors KNOW that I am in love for the first time in life and I just want to enjoy it? Don't all those people at work KNOW that you are just in bliss and you don't want to be told what to do? There has to be SOMEONE who figured out life in a simple manor, got over the little stuff and most importantly......lived happily ever after. OHHHHHHHHHH BUT THERE IS!   Remember Mary Poppins?? She swoops in carried by a great big umbrella, a huge smile on her face that matches that huge bag that she is carrying in one hand. She has a song in her heart and she NEVER has a bad day. Don't most of us WISH to the Lord above that we had ONE ounce of what that dear woman had? She made the impossible happen. She made children happy. She made all right in the world with a snap of her fingers. I dont know about you but I AINT NO MARY POPPINS. I do all I can to keep the bad people at bay and the bills paid. I make choices that I know will impact my life in a positive way but somehow they get twisted to things that impact my life negatively. I keep going....what more can you do? I get up, go to work, make friends and try to remember to breathe somewhere along the rocky path set before me. It can't be THAT hard. Just remember to have fun, take time to jump in a chalk drawing every once in awhile and ABOVE all, just remain positive. CHECK.    Maybe life would be alittle easier if I chose to look at the things that I DO have control over....   Maybe if everyday I came home and drew a picture on the ground with Sidewalk chalk....maybe if I took more time to talk to my friends. Maybe if I took more time on myself......   Then and maybe then, would feel like "A spoon full of sugar makes the medicine go down." Maybe if I spent more time thinking about the reprocussions of my actions, then life would go more smoothly. Maybe if I took more chances instead of less......the outcome would be greater than I could have expected.       Until later,   Amy Cap

       I want to first thank my friend Laura B   urlLink  http://www.lauras-place.com/    for showing me blog and what a great outlet it is.  With that out of the way, I plan on using this blog as a place to ramble on things that bother me, things that weigh on my mind and as a general outlet for the crap inside my head. The way that I see it, life is something we have to figure out day by day but it sure helps the process if you can THINK before you act and figure out WHAT to do BEFORE you attempt it.  I think the major thing that started me on this "Blog Path" was the fact that I am still trying to figure out what or who I am.....I am a 26 year old ALMOST divorced mother of 2, working mom and daughter to my lovely mother. When I look, all I see is labels. Labels of what I SHOULD be or how others SEE me. I feel an intense need to be what my HEART tells me instead of what I am expected to be. Once you make one move in life towards an emotional freedom, you must not stop or slow down. If you do, you will doubt yourself, Doubt those around you and over analyze every choice you make. The little things start to seem like they matter. "Do you want fries with that???" Now I am thinking...."Geeeeeeez. Do I?? Do I really NEED the fries? Do I really WANT fries and I just didn't think of it before it was suggested??" Now maybe I am oversimplifying things at this point for arguments sake but you get the point. I plan on telling more about the things in life that have brought me to the point of sitting at McDonald's and crying over fries but for now....just know that I think myself BRAVE. I think of myself as unselfish. I think of myself as a Hippie Freak that is just looking out for this world and my fellow man......I think of myself as somewhat deep, somewhat intellectual and somewhat sassy. I will try to stay on my toes and make something worthwhile here. Hang in there.....I gotta get better.  Until Later, Amy Cap
