      Glorious day I have received a coveted Gmail account, now no one can steal AverageCypress from me.  My vapid, empty life is safe from the crushing disappointment of reality.  Plus I can finally tell Hotmail that they can take their 2 megabytes of storage and cram neatly up their collective asses.  The following is my vision of the Hotmail conception meeting.    Ass Sucking Yes Man 1:  Hey Billy Gates we're a bunch cheap, money-grubbing whores who enjoy bending consumers over rails and dry fucking them until blood pours from their ears, aren't we?  Billy Gates:  Um I do enjoy the ass fucking of the consumers.  Why have we thought of any new ways to financially violate the population at large?  Ass Sucking Yes Man 1.2:  Well me and Ass Sucking Yes Man 1 through 1.6 were snorting cocaine off the thighs of transexual Thai hookers when it hits us.  We sucker people in with a "free" email account, but we only give them 2mb of storage space, then charge them if they want more.(insane laughter followed by sounds of heavy petting)  Billy Gates: Ass Sucking Yes Man 1 through 1.6 you treat yourselves to the employee 401(k) fund for a week you've earned it.(High five all around the room then have Steve Ballmer pump up the troops with his patented screech of doom.   urlLink Watch video .)  I have no issues with Microsoft products themselves, but I do not enjoy paying out the ass for software only to receive a buggy product and tech support from people who obviously hate anyone who consumes their oxygen.  Then top it all of by listening to people scream that the money goes to R&D of new, better products.  Fuck you and the R&D horse you rode in on, they spend more on advertising and making a pretty box to package things in then on R&D.  Large corporations while providing some nice and convenient things are sucking the life out of our country and all our elected officials do is hold out their slime palms and ask for more money.

      I just read a most interesting story on  urlLink Fox News , the article in question is about half way down the page. It involves a man that had coated his entire Motel 6 room in Vaseline, his entire fucking room people.  "Police found 14 empty Vaseline containers and numerous pornographic magazines in the room's trash can."  Flogging the dolphin I can understand, hell I can even support it (insert pervert laugh here), but what kind of masturbatory act requires you to grease up your entire room, if you happen to know please for the love of God email  urlLink AverageCypress , and no pictures you sick freaks. It does gets better though people, "A sheriff's deputy found the Virginia man a short time later at another motel. The deputy said the man was "smeared from head to foot with Vaseline."  Chalk one more up for the boys in blue for keeping the streets safe and penetration-free.  If you're surprised that our culprit is from the South please raise you hand, and an attendant will be around to smack the stupid out of you.

      The following is a small rant, and is not intend to offend or belittle the pain people have suffered.  That being said why in holy fuck are we sending civilian contractors to work in a   war zone   and then acting shock when the get kill or are used as bargaining chips.  Now it would be a huge surprise if these people were being taken from their warm comfortable beds in the middle of the night, but they're no, they are willingly traveling to an active war zone (yes assholes it is still a war) in the pursuit of monetary gain.  I'm not some bleeding heart, captialist-hating commie, but I would not put my lilly white ass on the line just for some extra cash.  We need to start treating the Iraq War like a motherfucking war and not some after-school special where we all get a warm and fuzzy feeling after learning that the tin secratary of defense always had a heart and the mentally-challenge president realizes that it's okay to ride the short bus.

      I just added a couple of new links that people might find amusing.  The link listed as BPLU is  urlLink Black People Love Us , if you're a politically correct dickhead this site is not for you, as is pokes fun at jerk-off WASPs and other ignorant social classes, if you don't know what WASP stands for, you probably are one.   urlLink The Chronicles of George  is a site for anyone who has ever worked in the tech industry and use Remedy for trouble tickets, I swear I have almost pissed my pants laughing at this journey into the mind of an idiot.  When reading the Chronicle of George you can't believe that someone of this inteligence level was hired by a company.  If you have fun or otherwise interesting links email them to  urlLink AverageCypress .

      Gasp!  UFO's do exist, at least they do if you believe the Mexican Air Force (I honestly didn't know Mexico had an Air Force).  If you want to read about this go to any news site, I use  urlLink Reuters  no reason just like them.  My favorite quote on this subject comes from an article on  urlLink Cnews .  "Hundreds of videos (of UFO's) exist, but none had the backing of the armed forces of any country...The armed forces don't perpetuate frauds."  This wonderful quote came from Jaime Maussan a Mexican UFO investigator.  I realize that many people who believe in and follow UFO sightings are open-minded, but since when have militaries ever told the fucking truth about anything.  Earth to UFO nuts mitlitaries lie that's how they survive, if they told the truth they would die both figuratively and literally.  So as I see it when a government says there are no UFO's the true believers call them liars, but when they endorse UFO's governments are equated the Virgin Mary (I have no empirical proof of her virginity).  UFO junkies are waffling more than John Kerry (this is a joke not an endorsement of Bush).  Have a wonderful day UFO filled day (I use parenthesis way to much).

      If anyone has any ideas for a way for me to make enough money so I can quit working and become a wealthy bum, plaese let me know.  Working really sucks, I believe in an Anthropology class I was told, and don't quote me on this, that during the "Hunter and Gather" days of our collective human history people worked an average of 20 hours a week.  Now for all you math majors out there thats half the time we spend working in the present day with our wonderful modern and time saving conveniences.   Don't get any ideas I am no Unibomber(not sure on the spelling), I don't hate technology, it actually pays my bills, but there are times I would like to live in a friggin' cave.

      Another Monday has past and I feel like enacting violence upon people, but luckily there are a few website that help your work day fly on by.  If you also get the urge to commit acts of homicide in your cubicle try heading over to  Ebaums World   most likely the best collection of all things funny on the Internet in one place.  If your work place is more forgiving of adult themed humor try  Kontraband  they have a butt ton of fun games and videos, some not all have a little T & A (that tits and ass for the handicapped).  Check out the sound boards a Ebaums if you get the chance, but be warned it my cause some urinal leakage.

           I was watching the Fox News channel today, about 2:00 pm PST, and they happen to show some e-mailed comment about the recent abuses of Iraqi prisoners.   Now some Jack@ss had the gall to spout-off on how it was disgusting that the media and others were saying that  it was wrong to condemn the U.S. soldiers because we were not there and didn't understand what they were going through.   He then finished this well thought out argument with "those prisoners are just lucky I'm not over there."  I was actually quite surprised that learn that bigoted @ssholes had learned to use computers.  It hurts my head trying to comprehend what little kernel of thought prompted him to hop on the computer and fire of this humdinger of an e-mail.  Did he seriously think that hordes of Americans would rally to his cause, millions of reasonably intelligent people simultaneously slapping themselves in the forehead and think what dicks they had been for judging those poor, poor soldiers who only tortured and humiliated fellow humans in the name of  justice .  Some people are just morons.

            "We're all working together; that's the secret. And we'll lower the cost of living for everyone, not just in America, but we'll give the world an opportunity to see what it's like to save and have a better lifestyle, a better life for all. We're proud of what we've accomplished; we've just begun."  - Sam Walton (1918-1992)   How anyone can read that and not drop to the ground laughing while pissing their pants is beyond me.  Wal-Mart is actually responsible for degrading the lifestyle of America, it's true read the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Workforce report.  Wal-Mart pays it's "associates" a poverty level wages, $13,861 is the average annual wage for a Wal-Mart employee, $14,630 is consider the poverty line for a family of three.  "Associate" is Wal-Mart slang for "slave", and this is not libel it is documented fact that Wal-Mart has repeatedly force employees to work off the clock without pay, therefore making them slaves.  They have been sued in the following states for not paying employees: Colorado, Texas, Oregon, and Minnesota.  Wal-Mart store managers blame this on the fact that Wal-Mart corporate office puts pressure on managers to keep labor cost low.  Here's an idea hire illegal immigrants to do all the manual labor, they're cheap and they can't complain when you lock them in the store over night.  Oh, wait, no you already did that and it back fired on you horribly.  I know maybe you could start to sell babies, or even human organs, big market for human organs.    Hold on a second Wal-Mart does some good right?  Wrong Wal-Mart does no good and any money they might donate to "charity" or other cause is tainted.  Any company that will not give employees the time to satisfy basic human needs such as taking a fucking piss, is on the "Axis-of-Evil" list, I already wrote GW Bush and had him add Wal-Mart.  This quote taken directly from the congressional report reveals the underlying and core problem with Wal-Mart and it's Draconian labor policies.  "The Committee on Education and Workforce estimates that one 200-person Wal-Mart store may result in a cost to federal taxpayers of $420,750 per year - about $2,103 per employee.  Specifically, the low wages result in the following additional public cost being passed on to taxpayers."  So you can get you guns, censored music, and child made clothing at low, low prices, but in the end you pay more supporting the Wal-Mart employees.    Wal-Mart uses patriotic colors and images in advertising, but Wal-Mart is the leader in selling non-American products.  An estimated 50-60 percent of it's products come from overseas, "In 2002, the company bought 14 percent of the $1.9 billion of clothes exported by Bangladesh to the United States."  Wal-Mart is nothing but zombies in blue vests forcing the Nazi-like "Culture" of Sam Walton down Americas throat.  So go to Wal-Mart's website and tell them to put a new Wal-Mart on Super Slammin' Sam Walton's grave.

      Yesterday was another great day for the government to trample the rights of the people.  The protectors of the Constitution, our Supreme Court has ruled that HMOs can now refuse you the treatment that is recommended by a doctor, you know those little bastards who only spent 10 plus years studying medicine, what the fuck do they know.  After refusing you this treatment and you almost die, as in the case of Aetna Health Inc.  v.  Davila, you now have no recourse to seek reimbursement for the damages done to your well-being, you can only try and get reimbursed for the cost of the treatment.  Jeez Jimmy, we sure are sorry that your HMO refused to pay for the heart medication, but on the positive side now your dirt poor family has one less mouth to feed.  They also stripped your right to sue in a state court, any lawsuit against HMO’s fall under ERISA.  “ERISA’s integrated enforcement mechanism, which are intended to ensure that employee benefit plan regulation is “exclusively a federal concern.”  That is directly from the opinion by Justice Clarence “Big Pimpin” Thomas.  I got one for you C.T. “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”  Suck on that, bitch!  I’d love to see the video from the hand-job party threw by the HMO lobby that got nine justices to green light HMOs to now dictate whether you live or die.  I’m guessing Ruth Ginsburg and Sandy O’Conner where tag teaming Rehnquist and Clarence “Pubic Hair” Thomas, while Scalia was giving Souter and Stevens hand-jobs in the closet, but the weird part was Steve Beyer and Tony Kennedy in the corner pouring hot wax on each others nipples while giggling.  The HMO lobby always throws the best parties. 	 Justices be proud, it takes a strong backbone to push the people aside in favor multi-billion dollar companies.  Don’t mind that pulsating chant of “Corporate-Whore” in your heads it's just your consciences try to reassert themselves.  In conclusion the United States Supreme Court can go fuck itself, Americans should always get preference over a company.

      	I bring to you today a story of triumph and heroism.  A story of over coming odds so great it will make your rectum itch.  I shall begin our tale with the beginning.  	Our hero was born on July 6, 1946, in New Haven, Connecticut.  His birth was trying and extremely painful for his mother Barbara, fortunately she deserved it for not getting an abortion.  During his 104-hour birthing process his umbilical card had rebelled and become an unpatriotic terrorist sympathizer, this have a lasting effect on his future.  Luckily his mother’s O-B-G-Y-N (yes you must spell it ask any woman) was world famous for rooting out lefty liberal body parts.  His parents decide to name him George, mainly because that was his fathers name and also they were very lazily people.  At the age of 4 his father, while on vacation from his government job, took him to a rail-yard where a train backed over him.  He was operated on for two days by Americas top neurosurgeons, they managed to save his life, but had to removed the part of the brain that prevents most humans from making up words.  After his father paid for him to graduate from Yale University, he jumped from failed business venture to failed business venture.  He finally realized he needed to move into a job sector that rewarded ineptitude, so he ran for Governor of Texas.  He easily won the governorship main because Texans are Mexican or retarded.  His tenure as the leader of Texas was bathed in the blood of state sanctioned ‘tard killings; under his rule no IQ was too low to prevent an execution from going forward.  With his popularity with Southern handicapped-hating voters at an all-time high his puppet masters decided have him run for President of the United States.   He managed, with some help from his brother Jeb, to squeak into the White House.    By now you must realize this is a joke and I’m speaking of mein leader George W. Bush.  If this has offended you in any way, please understand that I really could fucking care less, in fact you should step outside and run into traffic.  Before any fuck-off republican cock whores email me about what a liberal douche bag I am, understand this I hate all politicians.  Democrat, Republican, Green Party is doesn't matter, they will all sell your children to Chinese pedophiles if it means getting re-elected. Any one and everyone in today’s political arena is corrupt on some level, just so happens that our current President is more crooked than the hair up John Ashcroft’s ass.

      I decide to write an informative and helpful message to EDS who has recently bent it’s subcontractors over a rail and dry fucked them.  I being a subcontractor for one of their large and horribly mismanaged contracts had my pay cut, while other subcontractor were forced to slash their work forces by as much as 44%.  This has put me in a unique position to give very helpful advice.  Now I can’t speak for EDS’s other projects only the one I work on, and if they handle their other contracts they way they handle this one people should sell their stock now and invest in helmets for the handicapped.  Here’s a list of helpful tips to get EDS back on track.  o	Don’t make the most drastic cuts in the information security department, firing the people who know all your secrets and are now in desperate need of money is not good thinking.  o	It’s really not good for employee morale to cut pay then ask them to take up the slack for people they fired.  We tend to get bitchy and work quality mysteriously degrades.  o	Don’t ask employees to take pay cuts, and then ask them to work harder so that upper management can get performance bonuses.  If you do, don’t whine when they call you Weasel Fucking Bastards, it’s how the game is played.  o	Don’t sign contracts that calls for you to pay $400 for maintenance on light bulbs.  It makes you look retarded.  o	Communication between departments is a good thing.  Despite what you think we are actually working with each other and not plotting a bloody coup.  o	If you have information that can help your people do their jobs better, give it to them.  Do not treat like treasure and bury it.  o	Pay cuts should start at the top, where the piss poor management happens.  Don’t punish employees and subcontractors because you hired your semi-retarded nephew who doesn’t know the first thing about managing a multibillion-dollar contract.  EDS just follow these simple tips and your stock will rise, and the revolution will be quelled.

      So I was informed by a friend that my link bar had been partially covering my posts.  I guess this had been happening for a few weeks, so here is my apology.  Fuck it.  See wasn't that a heart felt apology, but now on to more important things.  I work at a helpdesk as a Customer Service Rep., meaning I'm the one who has to go out to the end user when the brain trust answering the phones can't walk the user through the process of turning on their computer.  Now I know you're thinking this has to be an exaggeration human beings can't be to stupid to figure out button pushing and other tasks lower primates can do, but this really does happen, frequently.  As a matter of fact a particular customer, let's call this person "Fat Douche Bag", decide this week to make a play for the crown of asshole-of-the-month.  On Tuesday of said week "Fat Douche Bag" calls the helpdesk to complain her speakers would not operate, through a trouble shooting method I can only imagine involves making chimp sounds and slamming your genitals in a desk drawer, it's determined that the speakers are broken and need to be replaced.  Captain Dipshit answering the phones foregoes the common practice of trying to resolve the problem and dumps the ticket into our laps.  So I called up "Fat Douche Bag" and ask a very basic question.  Are the speakers turned on? "Fat Douche Bag's" reply is "I don't know".  So I ask if the little green light directly above the On knob is lit.  "Fat Douche Bag" answers with an mind boggling "I think so, but I'm not sure".  I'M NOT SURE!?!?! ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME.  Can you not tell the difference between light and the absence of light, my God!  How does one function in a industrial world without the basic skill of recognizing light.  Next I ask "Fat Douche Bag" to make sure the speakers are plugged into the wall.  I hear some grunt and wheezing so I assumed this meant "Fat Douche Bag" is actually checking the power strip, I will soon learn that assuming was my mistake.  "Fat Douche Bag" tells me that the speaker are in fact plugged into the wall and then complains about having get out of the chair to check.  At this point I realize that any conversation over the phone would be an exercise in futility, so I joyfully drive on over to "Fat Douche Bag's" location.  First thing that I noticed was that the light above the speaker knob was not on, I determined this by using the theory of wave-particle duality and also the motherfucking light was not on.  I then proceeded to exert the effort to lean over and check under the desk where I saw the plug was out of the goddamn power strip, see I was wrong to assume.  So being the professional that I am I plugged "Fat Douche Bag's" speakers back in and nicely explained the issue to "Fat Douche Bag", who then said "That was it?  Kind of a waste of a trip."  That when I went into the nearest bathroom and slammed my face into the mirror.  Some people are prime example of why abortions are a good idea.

      Through out my travels on, in, and around the so-called "Internet" I will find something that just isn't quite right.&nbsp; Today I have one example of the "quite not rightness".&nbsp; I found a lovely headline on Google News about a Clinton advisor being investigated for remove papers from the National Archive.&nbsp;     Now I being an old fashioned gent I thought it was kind of harsh to probe a guy just because&nbsp;he tooks some documents, but then I found out that NARA (National Archives and Records Administration) actually warns people that they will probe your ass if you are caught stealing from them.&nbsp; So I can't feel to bad since he had been notified of the repercussions of his actions.&nbsp; The following&nbsp;is a screen-shot from NARA's&nbsp;website, pay close attention to the second paragraph.     So to anyone out there thinking of fucking around with NARA better think twice, these fuckers do not mess around when comes to protecting Amercian history.

      I got into a discussion the other day with a co-worker, a Mormon co-worker, about our Supreme Court looking at the effects of other countries laws when making ruling on our constitution and laws. For the record I won this argument, he quit when it was apparent that his argument was flawed due to him being brain washed by his church. His stance was, this would undermine the sovereignty of America, and put us under the control of foreign nations. I calmly stated that he was fool and how in the hell would it hurt for us to look at other people’s successes and failures when making a decision. What kind of idiot would not use the example set by others to figure out the correct path to take. I’ll tell you what if I’m watching an American and an Englishman standing on a cliff-side and the American steps forward and falls to his death and the Englishman turns around and walks away I’ll follow the goddamn limey for sure, fucking patriotism be damned.    Now after I pointed out his flaw in not learning from history and all that, he decided to change to flow of that discussion to something he thought he knew. He began to argue that America’s real problem was that our political leadership (not the republicans) was sending us down&nbsp;a path&nbsp;of moral depravity, because they did not make or pass laws based on their faith in Jesus Christ&nbsp;our Lord and Savior. At this point my jaw came unhinged and dropped to floor. He pointed out that a large majority of America is Christian, and he was correct. I then pointed out that most Christian denominations considered Mormons heretics and would pass laws that required Mormon to be killed. I also then pointed out that Mormons were killed in every state that tried to settle in until they found the one state no else wanted. He then said that Utah was a gift from the baby Jesus, and I said then why in the Hell didn’t Joseph “Magic Crystals” Smith just take you right to fucking Utah. At that point I was told a non-believer couldn’t understand. Must be because I don’t wear holy underwear and subjugate women.

      You'll notice I threw up a link to  urlLink http://www.christianhacker.org . I am in no way condoning this kind of slack minded fucktardiness. I do ask that you visit this web site to stare in wonder at evolving process of eliminating faith from religion. Do not think that I am in any way a religious person, I just can't stand to watch the hypocritical "born-again" or "stupid dipshit's who can't make morale decisions for themselves" as I like to call them, proclaim godliness and never take the time to learn one thing about the faith they shove done everyone's throat.  What in the holy hell does the baby Jesus have to do with hacking. Now don't email me telling me how hacking is the intellectual prusuit of hidden knowledge 'cause I don't give a fuck. Jesus is to hacking as monkey poop is to Curling. For those who don't know Curling is a Winter Olympic sport involving LSD and not monkey poop. Sorry I went a little off topic there, back to the subject at hand. Now after the mind-fucking I got from Heaven's Hackers (much better name) I got the hankering to bone up on my Mormon doctrine.  Mormon's are a sad bunch of psuedo-Christians who are led by a modern day profit (intentional misspelling).  Mormons believe that God was once a man like all of us, and we can therefore become "God(s)" in our own right, unless you're a woman or black then you just get to hang out with new "Gods" and diddle yourself.  I wonder if becoming a God gives you a "Wang of Eternal Erection".  They also believe in the "laying of hands" that's code for being a bunch cheap fucks. Number 8 on their list of core beliefs is "We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly" now this one threw me for a bit of loop, because most intelligent people recognize that the Bible has been horribly mistranslated throughout history. I was getting kind of impressed that Mormons took this into account, but then I learned that they include this so that whenever the Bible contradicts one of their beliefs they just "Mistranslated" and the administer each other bare-butt paddlings. Number 12 makes you double-take and utter what the fuck. Oh yeah number twelve reads "We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates..." come little children learn that being subjugated is Gods way.  Let's just thanks Allah that Mormons don't actually believe this crap, they do it for the money and Bitches.   Man, oh Man they hae some fine ass ladies in the LDS flock, I think they have some kind of selective breeding program to whelp seriously fine poon to lure in the men-folk.   I really love the answer you get if you ask Mormon why they have a racist Church and they do.  The reply that you'll usually get is that they used to be racist, but only becasue that was the cluture of the country then, nothing better than a church that teaches people to follow the crowd when comes to making morale choice.  Since then (way back in 1978) the almighty has come down from the heavens and proclaim "Let the motherfuckers in before they steal all our women" (it is a well know fact that Mormon women love black wang).   In conclusion fuck the Christian Right and ass rape the Mormons.

      When I was young I wanted to rule the world. I would be a kind and great ruler in the beginning. I would try and uplift the people, bring them to a new level humanity. My education system would ignite a new renaissance period, my healthcare system would increase the average lifespan 20 years. The people would be happy and over time the would become complacent. That is when they would see the true nature of a man with absolute power. I would crush their spirits and bend them to my will, fear and terror would rule. Sleep would be hard to find among the screams of the damned. Then after they could take no more they would rise up like a cornered lion, fighting with every last breath. People who hated each other would find common ground in their desire to crush me. That's when I decided maybe I should not rule the world, I will set my sights lower to a less violent species.  -AverageCypress Lord and Savior to the Hamsters
