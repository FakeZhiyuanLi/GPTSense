        man!!! my blog is looking better by the day.. all thanks to a COOL techno geek friend of mine   SHAFIKK!!!!   thanks bro! for doing up my blog..you just injected life into this pathetic lame old crib of mine..haha.  there's actually more to the exterior!! haha i actually thought he was a bitchy sarcastically(not as bad as me though!)devious lil' asshole. but it turns out to be...he's just like me! haha... *evil laughter* another similiar personality i've discovered in my entire shit of a life i've got.. when i woke up i felt totally shagged today. totally too tired to lethargic to do anything.. wanted to skip school.but there was no way i was gonna skip.. it was my F&N o levels coursework part B practical today*pheww!!*haha...well..the dough of the oil was totally DEEeEeEeEEEeeeeegusting!! man! it was fucked up.goodness.!!!haha...we had to take photos for the other form of results. at this point of time. i had the digital camera in my hands when weiting stared and shooted at me..   "Airell!! i asked for the camera first okayy!!"   "can you just let me use it for a moment or two?"   "no! i gotta do my practical!give it back to me!!!"   "here have it!!! slut...."     this only proves that the teenagers in singapore can only think of the cold and hard aspect of life!  RESULTS! MONEY! SUCCESS!! A 9-5 JOB!  i noticed that this is the only way i can survive in singapore. but please?!?! where's the more humane side of life??&nbsp; love?friends? care? concern??integrity??     all these happenings only blatantly reflect that life in singapore is like a complete regimented schedule. we seem to know when we're gonna die and we cram everything a few minutes before we die. if i had a chance..i'd rather be oblivious to the fact that i'm gonna die one day! i'm just gonna live till i die. sigh..stress is shit! fuck you stresS! i hate you!! i freakin hate everything that you fucking implied upon me. i can't take it you bitch! fuck you stress! fuck you!!! man..i can't help swearing.is that what we really want in life? a nice coffin to sleep in? its sounds so sardonic. but ironically people are somehow "craving" to die nowadays. and i can't help it but i know i feel almost the same way too.  and during mathematics lesson..mrs cheng gave my a session of berrating at me. i finished my math homework but she reprimanded me for not helping my friends.. can't help it. sigh.. i thought to myself -you want the blind to lead the blind???-  another typical shitass example is lihui! his nick "i'm gonna claim back my topspot" who the fuck cares! if you wanna work for it. go for it!and thanks for that shit ass lecture you gave us "in SoS our midfield&nbsp;are the ones that are failing our team bringing in our defence. WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT?!?! you wanna blame it all on us is it?! motherfucker.you can't take it..just quit shit ass wuss! backstabbing us like fuck! you think all of us have a wicked and sad little pee-wee mentality you have?! if i had a fucking weapon that i could kill you with. i'd do it if i had a chance! fook you! you're such a wuss..  well..i've said all i wanted for today.thanks shafik you are deeply gratified..i love you.  &nbsp;

[Break - Mario Winans]   Did he touch you better then me (touch you better then me)   Did he watch you fall asleep (watch you fall asleep)   Did you show him all those things that you used to do to me (do to me baby)   If your better off that way (better off that way)   Baby what I like to say (all that I can say)   Go on and do your thing and don't come back to me(Stay away from me baby)   [Verse 3 - P. Diddy]   I don't wanna know where your whereabouts or how you movin   I know when you in the house or when you cruisinIt's been proven, my love you abusin   I can't understand, how a man got you choosin (yeah)   Undecided, I came and provided ma   My undivided, you came and denied it (why?)   Don't even try it, I know when you lyin (I know when you lyin)   Don't even do that, I know why you cryin (stop cryin)   I'm not applyin no pressure, just wanna let you know   That I don't wanna let you go (I don't wanna let you go)   And I don't wanna let you leaveCan't say I didn't let you breathe   Gave you extra cheese (c'mon), put you in the SUV   You wanted ice so I made you freeze   Made you hot like the West Indies (that's right)   Now it's time you invest in me   Cause if not then it's best you leave   Holla, yeah   well... i've still got something for sue.. i just wanna know the truth that's all.. i don't wanna evade from reality like you do. i pray to someone from above to come and mend my confused sentiments. i hope that it'll all be resolved.    this melvin guy that she's together with won't give her as much as her other suitors can. he's an AH BENG! i don't wanna be together with her. but i want her to be together with a better man. not someone who's a total shitmuthafucka. i think i'll wash my hands clean off her from now on. bye sue.

       haha.. what a great day.. i arrived in school in a black baju kurung.. man.. the festive mood was omnipresent. haha. it was like total chaos.. no one wanted to study.. all of us were cheering consistently. 'twas a great day till we had chemistry!! mrs sundram sprang us a surprise test which was not due till tomorrow.. it was kinda fcuked up. and she didn't sport any festive costume at all. i mean.. she has a point there. why celebrate only one day of racial harmony day.. when its suppose to be there always. always embedded in our hearts that we should actually take note of other races around us. she may seemed like a "cynical wet blanket" like what tinah suggested. but she always seem to have her rights in doing her stuff.. she's quite a critique i must say.. she's always critical about the education in singapore and stuff.. about the politics that the human race has always fault in. she always has a point that i have to agree. she's a wise lady. i respect her.. and in all respects she deserves it.i aspire to be as wise as her one fine day. haha..i guessed that'll never be.. as she said she done it through SHEER hard work..tsk tsk.. i wished i had her determination. which i seldom lack pathetically.i gotsa ta go... bye peeps//

        i don't always practice what i preach.. but what i dreamt last night about the degradation of society was incorrigible. it seemed that kids as young as 2 started holding arms. they had negativity aura around their heads. i don't know why i had this dream. but as soon as i woke up. i was relieved to find out that it was actually a horrifying nightmare and not the harsh reality. however, what i dreamt of was probably a premonition i had. i don't think i'll be able to survive to see children carrying arms. and negativity. but i'm concerned of what may actually happen in the future. everybody's seems to be mugging and changing around me. but i'm still indifferent towards my dreadful Os.. what's going on?? i often question myself.. but i can't change my perspective of just "relaxing and slacking"..let me escape once again.    everytime i reflect.. i seemed to have grown a strand of white hair.. is that wise or is that foolish?what am i supposed to do. i can't carry on like this. but i've gotta remain optimistic. i'm gonna   change      into a better person.  heh... well... i don't know what i'm gonna evolved too.. i'm just a mixeduppieceofshit...  &nbsp; i woke up today and saw my dear tinah online..heh.. always my dash of light in the darkness.. always bring a smile to my face..she's&nbsp;my sunshine within the darkest of horizons. she's my only escape from my harsh reality. haha..TINAH..FRIENDS FOREVER.so cliche right?? haha...i got her to joined the "BLOGGING" community..hehehe.. well.. she said it was a complicated process..shows how D**b she is right..haha...

       Man... what the heck can i do man... early in the morning i woke up and got prepared for a extremely competitive match. we were playing against rojak fc.. and you know what? my team got trashed 11-1.. i don't wanna push the blame to anyone..but.. the mentality of a shitass of a goalkeeper...and ironically.. he told me in the morning that "it'll be 12 goals today"..  was it planned?! goodness!! 12 goals.. why is that shitass of a goalkeeper doing this.. he's seemingly totally power-hungry, sore loser!! i can't take it anymore!!!  argh.. all this shit angst is really spoiling my day..  getwaddimean.. i had a production and play to watch over that day.. a st nicholas girls school production.. i watched it because i wanted to.. sigh..it was nice but i had to watch it all alone!! ALL ALONE!!! nobody was there to appreciate it with me.. frankly, the play rocked... it was provocative.. it was nice.. man..it rocked..

       Fookin' hell.. i thought i actually submitted my first entry already..MAN.. nevermind..i'll take the effort to re-write since its my first blog. 'twas a baddd day today..there was actually a soccer matched planned. but we had to cancel it because of some WUSSIES said that the field conditions sucked and Sh*t like that.. i mean peeps...WHAT THE F*ck is wrong with you all?? "don't wanna dirty my soccer boots"- YOU WANNA KEEP IT CLEAN ALL YOUR LIVES!!&nbsp;  &nbsp;moreover, why are you people so POWER-CRAZY. and so "Kiasu".. is this what our background has brought us singaporean children into.. the age where the society degrades till the values of ours are disintergrating.  i'm so tired of the rigid, regimented and seemingly robotic lifestyle i'm leading right now..

        well.. i received my chinese o levels just yesterday. i didn't know what i felt. i felt elated because i passed with a mediocre grade.a B4. whether i should be happy or disappointed was all deep inside me. i felt so happy because i was satisfied with that one week of intense revision actually got me a B4! well..i know deep inside myself that this result isn't the best i can actually achieve if i had worked to my optimum.  but i did not.   i'm contemplating whether i should retake. but i think i'm gonna work and mug till the o levels are over. achieve a couple of good grades and enter to the mass communications that i've always been pining for. i deeply regret no having build a strong foundation of my studies in sec3. sigh...... i'd love to turn back time and correct all my wrongdoings. haha well..it isn't possible.    i'm planning to leap in my results no actually gonna slack. i feel the immense weight and pressure weighing down on me. haha. i think its enough to restrain my growth.i just went for mathematics tuition. sigh.. i wished i knew my math teacher earlier. then i would be able to lift my grades even quicker. tinah was so weird today. i didn't know what happened to her all of a sudden. she suddenly went into a an oppressed mood. sigh.. where's her wacky self. maybe she has chosen to mellow down instead of all her abrupt moves and antics. haha.. well.. her odd asphyxiation moves. panting heavily as if she really had asthma.      if i told you that i'll be there for you. would you believe me.please.

        its a great song by nelly ft. jaheim. well. frankly, i didn't thought it was that beautiful till i heard the song. i only saw the title upon a dreary lyrics site. thus i went to download that song. until today. i actually put my ear to it. i fell in love immediately with this song.    today's singapore idol took a heavy tug on my hearstrings. its stirred my emotions. i cried when i saw the people who were handicapped took a shot at stardom. well.. one guy who had a speech defect only wanted to prove that everything's possible. it took a heavy toll on my nonchalant personality. and guess what??(FLMP was just featured on artscentral!!!WOOHOO!!)get back to my reflections. i was so touched and i felt so emotional that i just kept on hugging on my cottoned pillow. i just couldn't take my mind off on the handicaps. well.. i was in a state of comatose as they rambled on the wannabe idols. till i came to the point where this guy who came on to sing with a speech defect. initially, i wanted to take a dig at him. but i realized that he was there for a reason and a cause. there was no way that i should disrespect him. i   found that it was something disgraceful that i actually had the pathetic thought of laughing at them. but when i heard why he actually tried. i actually cried. from now on, i'm gonna be changed person. this is gonna be the turning point of my life. its gonna take flight. i don't wanna live selfishly.i'm gonna share.      When we laugh or we cry it's together Through the rain and the stormiest weather We gon still be as one it's forever, it's forever

          got over the wound that i had yesterday. the wound healed by itself. don't know why. i think our years of friendship is nothing compared to just this spur-of-the-moment anger. i woke up just to find myself covered and suffocated by layers of cotton sewn together above me. my blankets were so warm. i could actually feel heatwaves. damn! my mum had switched the air-conditioner off early again. the morning sun shone on my arse. it was BURRNNNNINGG!!!!! ~pheww... well..      i was so lazy that i woke up only at 9.49, how late was that! totally crazy. wished i had a chance to go on a soul vacation. relax and just chill with a couple of my friends on beach at the maldives! reminiscing the beautiful beach i had been 2 years ago. it totally pales in comparison with the concrete jungle i'm trapped in now.there's no way out. i always tend to have this sort of memory flashbacks happen to me whenever i feel trapped. but its kinda enjoyable and soothing to the senses whenever i think of the maldivian beach.WOOOHOOO!!!! and the korean girl i met there..boy!!was she pretty!!!     heh...guess my hormones took on a rage again. i had to study.thus i went with my mum off to compass point lugging a heavy sling bag. took a stress on my frail shoulders. red treadlines glowered angrily when i took a look later(PRIVATELY!!)     i did chemistry. and i was proud of myself..i did a total of 63 questions. my sister met us later and we had light snacks here and there. mmmm.....its been long since i had such a CHILLLLLL day.... just relax and walk relax and walk. and not forgetting nor abandoning my studies of course.!i was rewarded with karmelkorn with nuts in orange julius!! pure heaven. a drug to me. my one way ticket to cloud #9.heh..      i think its kinda dumb doing a report of my daily activities. its like doing a thesis. fuck this! haha. well.. got no shit against the rest who do this. but i think its more important and more worthwhile of my time if i talked and type about issues concerning us.. i just realized that my keyboard is squeaking for a new change..haha the spacebar is screaming"arhh!!! i'm rusty!!"     wacky!!    some people want it all, but i don't want nothing at all if it ain't you babe.mesmerizing and neverending desirable you.

       i feel so exhausted. shagged.dead.stoned.smoked. i'm so stressed. exasperated.i feel like screaming.so much angst within me.i feel as if there's no more life in me.step by step, second after second, day by day, i feel stressed. pushed to the verge of sanity. i hope i can do well. i'm putting in my best in my studies.totally sunken.o levels seems like the prelude to many, also the ending for others. i'm thinking rubbish. formulae speed through my minds like a bullet train travelling and dashing at blinding speed. haha! the joke today was that i was allocated a similar group to yinqi. she threw a tantrum. just stormed away. i understand the way she feels. it was my fault. and if she ever gets to read this... i SINCERELY apologize for the past(no sarcastic pun intended). i seek her forgiveness. i was disappointed with my class. i didn't know someone would actually would stoop so low just for 20 smackeroos?! what's going on.. well..i didn't know that so many stuff were missing in our class. i thought we had trust in all of us.

        i came back home feeling lethargic and exhausted. i'm being pushed to the brink of sanity. falling off any moment now. i was totally crazy after i finished my part B coursework. sigh! i have no space to vent my pent-up frustrations.. i feel as if the emotions in my head are threatening to burst right out of my head right now. i need something to do. worthy of my time. something stress-relieving. haha i think talking to sheena might help. she's so blur till it makes everything look light. like nothing in the world really matters except happiness.sigh. like what i learned from the SBM sharing session that. when our happiness is focused on something exterior and not something internal. it isn't true happiness. i have to agree with that point. but has anyone actually thought that its almost impossible to do that in our society nowadays.

        hey peeps. i just read the two blog entries of tinah's and i found out that she owns a perverse mind of eloquence. her unique,qwerky yet smooth compositions found a way to my heartstrings. i thought that maybe i could have done up my blog with more of her eloquence. i never have a habit to actually write as smooth and emotional as tinah. after i read her blog i was again inspired. it was ticklish to my heartstrings when i read her entries. totally awed and impressed. i couldn't find words to describe her pieces of work.it seems as if this entry is specially dedicated to Tinah. i've only known her prim and proper for 6 months. but i feel as if i've known her for lifetimes before. we did not clicked immediately because of myself. *giggles* (GAY!) well.. Tinah. you're my friend and forever will be.      Friend   Simple yet complex   through vines we ran.    Till we came to an end,   it was the clearing.    Just like the silver lining to every cloud.   Friends forever(cheesy!)but no doubt!
