      "But for the use of physical punishment by, and fear of, their oppressors, animals would never be a part of a circus." — Richard Pryor  Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus paints a picture of happy animals doing tricks because they like to. We ask you to read the following and decide whether that's true. Here are Ringling's own words juxtaposed with the facts:Ringling:"At Ringling Bros., the relationship between animals and humans is built on mutual respect, trust, and affection." Reality:Video footage of Ringling trainers shows an elephant being whipped in the face and gouged with metal hooks. Ringling:"We are proud of our USDA inspection reports." Reality:Ringling Bros.' USDA inspection reports are riddled with instances in which federal inspectors found that Ringling Bros. had failed to comply with minimum federal regulations, and the circus has been cited for causing animals unnecessary trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, and discomfort, a failure to provide animals with veterinary care, a failure to provide animals exercise, a failure to provide sufficient space, as well as not keeping the proper veterinary records. Ringling:"None of our animals are taken from the wild." Reality:The Asian Elephant Regional Stud Book, the industry resource for information on elephant births, deaths, and captures, shows that the majority of Ringling's elephants were captured in the wild. Ringling:"Trainers teach animals routines that showcase their natural behaviors, beauty, and distinctive personalities."Reality:In nature, bears don't ride bicycles, elephants don't stand on their heads, and a tiger would never hop on his hind legs. To force wild animals to perform confusing acts, trainers use whips, muzzles, electric prods, and bullhooks. In their real homes, these animals would be free to raise their families, forage for food, and play together. Instead, the circus forces them to perform night after night, for 48 to 50 weeks every year. Between acts, elephants are kept chained and tigers are "stored" in cages with barely enough room to take one step. Ringling has also invented a "unicorn" by mutilating a baby goat--surgically moving his horns to the center of his forehead. Ringling:"Future generations will be able to experience the wonder ... of Asian elephants because of what we're doing today." Reality:Circuses have claimed for decades that exhibiting endangered Asian elephants will inspire their protection. Yet in 2000, poachers killed 60 free-roaming female elephants so that their babies could be collected and sold to the entertainment industry. The still-nursing elephants, all under the age of 3, refused to abandon their dead mothers, even attempting to suckle from their corpses. Ringling:"Our training methods are based on positive reinforcement in the form of food rewards and words of praise." Reality:Ringling has opposed proposed laws banning cruel training methods. In comments submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture dated April 17, 2000, Ringling opposed language in the agency’s "Draft Policy on Training and Handling of Potentially Dangerous Animals" that reads, "Hot shots, shocking collars, or shocking belts should not be used for training or to handle the animals during exhibition, and any such use will be closely scrutinized. An ankus may not be used in an abusive manner that causes wounds or other injuries." Ringling:"We fully cooperate with all U.S. Department of Agriculture investigations."Reality:According to an internal February 25, 1999, U.S. Department of Agriculture memo written by an inspector and detailing injuries found on two baby elephants during a February 9, 1999, inspection, "[Ringling veterinarian] Dr. Lindsay was very upset and asked repeatedly why we could not be more collegial and call him before we came. I explained to him that all our inspections are unannounced. ... All Ringling personnel were very reluctant to let us take pictures [of the calves’ rope lesions]. … [Ringling employee Jim Williams] proceeded to interrogate me. … He then began badgering me. … He then walked away in apparent disgust." Ringling:"Ringling Bros. has pioneered the use of a traveling perimeter fence within which our elephants can exercise and socialize." Reality:In 1993, Ringling Bros. helped defeat legislation in California that would have limited the number of hours per day that elephants could be chained. Ringling wrote, "Chaining is a safe and acceptable means of protecting both the elephants and the public." To read more about what's wrong with elephants in circuses,  urlLink click here . It's up to you to make a difference. Choose only circuses that do not use animals.

Here are some quick facts: In the wild, bears don’t ride bicycles, tigers don’t jump through fiery hoops, and elephants don’t stand upright on their hind legs. Circuses portray a distorted view of wildlife.Laws protecting animals in traveling shows are inadequate and poorly enforced. The Animal Welfare Act establishes only minimum guidelines and even these meager standards are often ignored.Animals used in circuses live a dismal life of domination, confinement, and violent training. It is standard practice to beat, shock, and whip them to make them perform ridiculous tricks that they cannot comprehend.Most elephants used by circuses were captured in the wild. Once removed from their families and natural habitat, their lives consist of little more than chains and intimidation. Baby elephants born in breeding farms are torn from their mothers, tied with ropes, and kept in isolation until they learn to fear their trainers.Big cats, bears, and primates are forced to eat, drink, sleep, defecate, and urinate in the same cramped cages.Elephants often suffer crippling injuries from constant chaining and performing physically difficult tricks.Children, who are naturally fond of animals, would have to be dragged kicking and screaming to the circus if they knew of the suffering these animals endure for a fleeting moment of so- called amusement.The circus deprives animals of their basic needs to exercise, roam, socialize, forage, and play. Stereotypic behaviors such as swaying back and forth, head-bobbing, pacing, bar-biting, and self-mutilation are common signs of mental distress.Using dangerous animals in performances jeopardizes public safety and often puts children at greatest risk. Since 1990, 57 people have been killed and more than 120 seriously injured by captive elephants.Animals in circuses are hauled around the country in poorly ventilated trailers and boxcars for up to 50 weeks a year in all kinds of extreme weather conditions. Access to the basic necessities of food, water, and veterinary care is often inadequate.A growing number of cities are restricting or banning the use of animals in entertainment. More progressive circuses dazzle their audiences solely with skilled human performers.

      Did you know that government agencies around the world spend your tax money shoving dogs into metal chambers and pumping in pesticides while the animals try in vain to escape the deadly poisons? Or that government researchers still swab burning chemicals into rabbits’ eyes and onto their shaved skin? Or that some government tests kill 3,000 animals every time they are conducted? This site will give you the information that you need to help the millions of animals suffering in chemical toxicity tests.  Right this minute in laboratories across the U.S., rabbits are confined to stocks while chemicals eat away the soft skin on their backs, right down to the muscle and tissue beneath. After the chemical does its damage, the rabbits are killed-their lives snuffed out in misery for just one more meaningless number on a chart. The tests are completely unnecessary because there are now cheaper, faster, and better non-animal tests that can replace them. If the U.S. followed the example of European countries, the suffering and deaths of countless animals could be prevented PETA has identified five tests on animals that could be stopped today without any threat to public health and safety. Click on the numbered links on the left to learn more about these tests and their non-animal replacements (or  urlLink click here  to download printer-friendly factsheets). Then check out the what you can do link to find out how you can help pressure U.S. agencies to turn their backs on animal testing once and for all.   Corrosive agents are chemicals that cause irreversible damage and destruction of the skin, often burning through several layers of tissue. Corrosive reactions are typified by ulcers, bleeding, bloody scabs, and discoloration.Corrosivity data are mainly collected by regulatory agencies concerned with the transportation of hazardous substances, in the event of a highway accident and chemical spill. In the U.S., the Department of Transportation requires the submission of skin corrosion data consistent with the standards of the United Nations Transport Authority. Corrosion is also an endpoint in skin irritation studies mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency in its assessments of pesticide formulations and ingredients. In this case, corrosivity represents the most extreme form of skin irritation, in which the skin is literally destroyed beyond the body’s ability to heal.  Rabbits are locked into full-body restraints and a test chemical is applied to the shaved skin on their back.The wound site is then covered with a gauze patch for the duration of the exposure period, normally four hours, after which the patch is removed and the degree of skin damage is read and scored at specified time intervals. Untreated skin areas serve as the control.A chemical is considered to be corrosive if, by the end of a 14-day observation period, the chemical has burned through the outer layer of the skin of one or more animals, leaving visibly dead tissue in its wake. No painkillers are provided.Despite their years of use, animal-based skin corrosion studies have never been properly validated. In fact, evidence exists that animal studies are highly variable, of limited reliability, and generally poor predictors of human skin reactions.For example, a comparison of data from rabbit tests and four-hour human skinpatch tests for 65 substances found that 45 percent of classifications of chemical irritation potential based on animal tests were incorrect. (MK Robinson et al., Food Chem Toxicol 40, 573-592, 2002) Human skin equivalent tests such as EpiDerm™ and EpiSkin™ have been validated and accepted in Canada, the European Union, and virtually all other member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), as total replacements for animal-based skin corrosion studies. These methods consist of normal, human-derived skin cells, which have been cultured to form a multi-layered model of human skin.The reliability and relevance of human skin equivalent models has been established through rigorous, inter-laboratory validation studies overseen by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM), and these methods have been accepted as an official OECD test guideline. However, their acceptance as stand-alone replacements in the U.S. has been undermined by several members of the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM), most notably the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which insists that “confirmatory” testing still be carried out using animals.Corrositex™ is another non-animal method of assessing skin corrosion. Using a protein membrane instead of skin, Corrositex™ can measure whether, and at what rate, a chemical is capable of penetrating the simulated skin barrier according to a color-change reaction. Corrositex™ was pioneered in the U.S., assessed by ICCVAM to confirm its validity, and subsequently accepted by both the U.S. Department of Transportation and European Union as a partial replacement for animal-based skin corrosion studies.   Skin absorption studies are carried out to determine the rate at which a chemical is able to penetrate the skin. A chemical’s dermal delivery rate is mainly of interest to regulatory agencies concerned with chemical exposures in the workplace. U.S. federal agencies that require the submission of skin absorption data include the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.  Rats’ backs are shaved and a chemical is smeared on them for an exposure period of up to 24 hours, after which the rats’ skin is washed and the animals are housed individually in “metabolism cages” to permit the collection of their excrement for analysis. Animals are later killed and their skin, blood, and excrement are analyzed, after which the rate of skin absorption is calculated. Despite their years of use, animal-based studies of skin absorption rate have never been properly validated to establish their relevance to people. Other disadvantages not mentioned include the potential for biasing the results of the animal studies by the process of washing off the test chemical from the animals’ skin, thus facilitating absorption of the test chemical. Various tissue culture methods have been rigorously evaluated and accepted in Europe as total replacements for animalbased skin absorption studies. These methods use skin from a variety of sources to measure the passage of a test chemical into and across skin to a fluid reservoir. Absorption of a test chemical is measured over time by analysis of the receptor fluid and the treated skin.The reliability and relevance of in vitro skin absorption studies have been thoroughly established through a number of international expert reviews, and these methods have been codified and accepted as an official test guideline of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).The non-animal tests have a number of scientific advantages over the animal tests, including the ability to study a broader range of doses, including those at the actual level of exposure that occurs in the occupational or ambient environment. Despite these clear advantages, however, most U.S. agencies continue to rely on animal testing to measure skin absorption.   Irritants are chemicals that cause skin damage that is reversible (unlike corrosion, which is irreversible). Clinical signs of irritation include the development of a rash, inflammation, swelling, scaling, and abnormal tissue growth in the affected area. A number of U.S. federal agencies require the submission of skin irritation data, including the Consumer Product Safety Commission (cosmetics and household products), the Environmental Protection Agency (pesticide formulations and ingredients), and the Food and Drug Administration (pharmaceuticals).  Rabbits are locked into full-body restraints and a test chemical is applied to the shaved skin on their back. The wound site is then covered with a gauze patch for the duration of the exposure period, normally four hours, after which the patch is removed and the degree of irritation is read and scored at specified time intervals. Untreated skin areas serve as the control.A chemical is considered to be an irritant if it causes reversible skin lesions, such as inflammation or other clinical signs, which heal partially or totally by the end of a 14-day observation period. No painkillers are provided.Despite their years of use, animal-based skin irritation studies have never been properly validated. In fact, evidence exists that animal studies are highly variable, of limited reliability, and generally poor predictors of human skin reactions. For example, a comparison of data from rabbit tests and four-hour human skin-patch tests for 65 substances found that 45 percent of classifications of chemical irritation potential based on animal tests were incorrect. (MK Robinson et al., Food Chem Toxicol 40, 573-592, 2002) Government regulators in Canada accept the use of a skinpatch test in human volunteers as a valid replacement for animal-based skin irritation studies. Human patch tests offer the benefit of being directly relevant to people, thus obviating the questionable practice of extrapolating the results of rabbit tests to humans. However, before a chemical is considered for a human skin-patch test, scientists first confirm that a chemical is not corrosive (using a non-animal method described in  urlLink the Skin Corrosion factsheet ) and carry out computer modeling and various test-tube studies to be certain that a chemical does not possess other harmful properties. Only chemicals that appear to be non-irritating move on to a human skinpatch test to confirm their safety.   Phototoxicity, or photoirritation, is an inflammatory skin reaction caused by exposure to a chemical and subsequent exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet radiation. Phototoxicity typically appears as exaggerated sunburn, which is characterized by the presence of a rash, swelling, and inflammation. This endpoint is mainly a concern for drugs and pharmaceuticals that are either ingested or applied directly to the skin in the form of a cream.The only regulatory agency in the U.S. that routinely requires phototoxicity studies is the Food and Drug Administration.  Mice or guinea pigs are locked into restraints and different concentrations of a test chemical are applied to patches of shaved skin on their backs. Half the animals are then exposed to ultraviolet radiation for two or more hours, after which the chemical is removed. The animals are then kept restrained for several days while experimenters examine their skin. Swelling and sores are common. No painkillers are provided. Despite their years of use, animal-based phototoxicity studies have never been properly validated to establish their relevance to people or even codified into a standardized test guideline. In fact, the only internationally recognized guideline for phototoxicity studies is the non-animal, cell-based test described at right. The 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) Phototoxicity Test was developed and validated in Europe and has since been accepted at the international level as a total replacement for animal-based phototoxicity studies. In this test, cells from the 3T3 cell line are exposed to a test chemical in the presence and absence of light. Photo-cytotoxicity is evaluated by the relative reduction in viability of cells exposed to the chemical in the presence versus absence of light, where cell viability is measured by degree to which they are able to absorb the dye, neutral red.Although the reliability and relevance of the 3T3 NRU Phototoxicity Test have been established through rigorous, inter-laboratory validation studies overseen by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM), and this method has been accepted as an official test guideline of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences continue to rely on animal testing to assess the phototoxic potential of new drugs and pharmaceuticals.   Pyrogens are fever- and inflammation-causing agents that can pose a serious health hazard, especially in the case of intravenous drugs and pharmaceutical products. The only regulatory agency in the U.S. that routinely requires pyrogenicity studies is the Food and Drug Administration.  A rabbit pyrogen test has been in use since the 1940s. In this test, rabbits are locked in full-body restraints and a test substance is injected into their bloodstream while their body temperature is monitored. The animals can suffer effects ranging from fever to breathing problems, circulatory and organ failure, and even fatal shock. Despite its long history of use, the rabbit pyrogen test has never been formally validated to establish its reliability or relevance to humans. In fact, there are a number of well-documented drawbacks to this test, including marked species and strain differences in sensitivity.(T Hartung et al.,ATLA 29, 99-123, 2001) An In Vitro Pyrogen Test has been developed and validated in Europe as a total replacement for animal-based pyrogenicity studies. As an immune reaction, pyrogenicity involves an interaction between a contaminant in a drug formulation and cells of the immune system. Using human blood donated by healthy volunteers as the test medium, this non-animal method is able to fully model the interaction between the immune system’s white blood cells and the test drug, thereby confirming the presence or absence of pyrogen contamination. Additionally, this determination can be made in vitro with greater speed and sensitivity and at a lower cost than animal-based methods would allow. Despite these advantages, the Food and Drug Administration continues to rely on animal testing to assess the pyrogenic potential of new drugs and pharmaceuticals.   January 15, 2004, marked the official launch of PETA's "Give the Animals 5" Campaign with a reception hosted by Congressman Jim Moran (D-Va.). Rep. Moran is taking the lead in making Congress aware of these non-animal methods and urging his fellow legislators to end the use of animal testing where internationally recognized non-animal methods can be used instead. In a letter to his colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives, Rep. Moran wrote: "We have enacted landmark legislation to protect the public from harmful chemicals. To carry out these laws, our federal agencies require pesticides and industrial chemicals to be tested to measure their toxicity levels. This is not cruel--this is good policy. "What is cruel, however, is to treat animals like test tubes. While no one is intentionally cruel in crafting measures to protect the public health, unfortunately, that is the result if we are not intentionally aiming to incorporate non-animal test methods. "I doubt any member of Congress believes that an animal should be subjected to pain in a toxicity test if a non-animal test would give an equally accurate result. I hope that you will review the information on the reverse and agree upon the same goal: The U.S. needs to take the lead in developing sophisticated, scientifically sound, non-animal toxicity testing methods." On February 23, 2004, Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Bridgeport) joined Rep. Moran in writing to the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In their letters, the members of Congress invited the head of each agency "to improve the science underlying your agency's regulatory decisions while also reducing animal suffering." They also posed a number of probing questions regarding the agencies' ongoing reluctance to embrace existing, validated non-animal test methods.  urlLink Click here  to find out how you can help pressure U.S. agencies to turn their backs on animal testing once and for all.

When Reese Witherspoon’s character in Legally Blonde 2 takes on the cosmetics-testing industry, everyone in the audience roots for her success against the cruel animal experimenters. In real life, too, most people agree that smearing hair color into a rabbit’s eye and pumping shampoo into a guinea pig’s stomach is idiotic. The European Union recently made its distaste for the practice public policy by voting to phase out all consumer product testing on animals. In the U.S., most people believe that this is a battle we won years ago. They are wrong, and their mistaken belief that no one kills animals in order to produce a new cosmetic or toiletry item means that they have stopped using their consumer dollars to protest this most despicable animal abuse. If we are to achieve the goal of the EU (and Witherspoon’s character)—an end to the use of animals in product testing—this must change. I understand where this myth of total success came from. I led People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals’ campaign against product testing on animals from 1989 to 1993. They were heady years, when the giants of the cosmetics industry fell like great oaks, one by one, crashing down amid undercover investigations documenting horrendous suffering in the testing laboratories. Videotape footage of a kitten convulsing after being doused with a chemical, a rabbit whose tender skin had been eaten away by a corrosive substance, rats in death throes after huge amounts of soaps were pumped into their stomachs, a beagle cowering alone in her box-like cage. These images blackened the eye of the consumer-product industry and sparked massive change.First Benetton cosmetics, after weighing the benefits and drawbacks of its animal tests, came to PETA and announced a permanent ban on all use of animals. Then came Avon, Revlon, and Estée Lauder, in rapid-fire succession. When I began my job, PETA listed fewer than 50 companies that refused to test on animals, most of them small, mail-order manufacturers that were the ethical leaders of the industry. Within three years, that list had grown to several hundred companies. For the first time since the animal tests were developed in the 1920s, ’30s, and ’40s, consumers could go into any department, grocery, or drugstore and buy mainstream brands from companies that did not harm and kill animals.On the scientific side, many non-animal tests were developed. Instead of measuring how long it took a chemical to burn away the cornea of a rabbit’s eye, manufacturers could now drop that chemical onto donated human corneas. Human skin cultures could be grown and ordered for irritancy testing. These and dozens more tests now in use today are cheaper, faster, and more accurate at predicting human reactions to a product than the old animal tests ever were. Despite these amazing successes, which translate into less suffering and death for animals, there are holdouts in the consumer-product industry. They are huge multiproduct manufacturers, including Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and others, driven by fear of lawsuits (though animal tests have not proved effective in a company’s defense when a consumer sues) and, inexplicably, inertia. Their reluctance to change in the face of consumer demand and superior non-animal test methods is difficult to understand, but one company CEO once told me that companies that continue to blind and poison animals do so simply because they have always done so and don’t have the vision to try a new and better way. “And,” he added, “they don’t want to prove PETA right.”Who would want to buy and use the products of a company whose executives are more interested in “winning” against a consumer campaign than in sparing animals miserable, caged lives and agonizing deaths? The European Union recently voted to phase out all product testing on animals, but the U.S. government is not following its example. The best way to stop companies from using animals is to refuse to purchase their products and to write and tell them why you won’t be applying their eye shadow, cleaning your clothes with their detergent, or washing your child’s hair with their shampoo. Now, as in 1989, the power is in the hands of the consumers. urlLink Click here  to learn more about product testing on animals.  urlLink Click here  to see behind the scenes of a product-testing laboratory and other laboratories that use animals. urlLink Order your free pocket-sized version  of PETA’s Cruelty-Free Shopping Guide.

      Whether you’re a staunch animal rights advocate, an activist who’s just getting started, or a complete skeptic, you can use these answers to help clarify your understanding of the animal rights movement. The responses presented here are by no means the only answers to these frequently asked questions. They are simply intended to provoke you to think about common assumptions and to serve as a resource as you formulate your own opinions.“What do you mean by ‘animal rights’?”People who support animal rights believe that animals are not ours to use for food, clothing, entertainment, experimentation, or any other purpose and that animals deserve consideration of their best interests regardless of whether they are cute, useful to humans, or endangered and regardless of whether any human cares about them at all (just as a mentally challenged human has rights even if he or she is not cute or useful and even if everyone dislikes him or her).“What is the difference between ‘animal rights’ and ‘animal welfare’?”Animal welfare theories accept that animals have interests but allow those interests to be traded away as long as the human benefits are thought to justify the sacrifice, while animal rights theories say that animals, like humans, have interests that cannot be sacrificed or traded away to benefit others. However, the animal rights movement does not hold that rights are absolute—an animal’s rights, just like those of humans, must be limited and can certainly conflict.Supporters of the animal rights movement believe that animals are not ours to use for food, clothing, entertainment, or experimentation, while supporters of the animal welfare movement believe that animals can be used for those purposes as long as “humane” guidelines are followed.“What rights should animals have?”Animals should have the right to equal consideration of their interests. For instance, a dog most certainly has an interest in not having pain inflicted on him or her unnecessarily. We are, therefore, obliged to take that interest into consideration and to respect the dog’s right not to have pain unnecessarily inflicted upon him or her. However, animals don’t always have the same rights as humans because their interests are not always the same as ours, and some rights would be irrelevant to animals. For instance, a dog doesn’t have an interest in voting and, therefore, doesn’t have the right to vote because that right would be as meaningless to a dog as it is to a child.“Where do you draw the line?”The renowned humanitarian Albert Schweitzer, who accomplished so much for both humans and animals in his lifetime, would take time to stoop and move a worm from hot pavement to cool earth. Aware of the problems and responsibilities that an expanded ethic brings, he said, “A man is really ethical only when he obeys the constraint laid on him to aid all life which he is able to help .… He does not ask how far this or that life deserves sympathy … nor how far it is capable of feeling.” We can’t stop all suffering, but that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t stop any. In today’s world of virtually unlimited choices, there are plenty of kind, gentle ways for us to feed, clothe, entertain, and educate ourselves that do not involve killing animals.“What about plants?”There is currently no reason to believe that plants experience pain because they are devoid of central nervous systems, nerve endings, and brains. It is theorized that animals are able to feel pain so that they can use it for self-protection purposes. For example, if you touch something hot and feel pain, you will learn from the pain that you should not touch that item in the future. Since plants cannot move from place to place and do not need to learn to avoid certain things, this sensation would be superfluous. From a physiological standpoint, plants are completely different from mammals. Unlike animals’ body parts, many perennial plants, fruits, and vegetables can be harvested over and over again without dying.If you are concerned about the impact of vegetable agriculture on the environment, you should know that a vegetarian diet is better for the environment than a meat-based one, since the vast majority of grains and legumes raised today are used as feed for cattle. Rather than eating animals, such as cows, who must consume 16 pounds of vegetation in order to convert them into 1 pound of flesh, you can save many more plants’ lives (and destroy less land) by eating vegetables directly.“It’s fine for you to believe in animal rights, but why do you try to tell other people what to do?”Everybody is entitled to his or her own opinion, but freedom of thought is not the same thing as freedom of action. You are free to believe whatever you want as long as you don’t hurt others. You may believe that animals should be killed, that black people should be enslaved, or that women should be beaten, but you don’t always have the right to put your beliefs into practice. The very nature of reform movements is to tell others what to do—don’t use humans as slaves, don’t sexually harass women, etc.—and all movements initially encounter opposition from people who want to continue to take part in the criticized behavior.“Animals don’t reason, don’t understand rights, and don’t always respect our rights, so why should we apply our ideas of morality to them?”An animal’s inability to understand and adhere to our rules is as irrelevant as a child’s or a person with a developmental disability’s inability to do so. Animals are not always able to choose to change their behaviors, but adult human beings have the intelligence and ability to choose between behaviors that hurt others and behaviors that do not hurt others. When given the choice, it makes sense to choose compassion.“Where does the animal rights movement stand on abortion?”There are people on both sides of the abortion issue in the animal rights movement, just as there are people on both sides of animal rights issues in the pro-life movement. And just as the pro-life movement has no official position on animal rights, the animal rights movement has no official position on abortion.“It’s almost impossible to avoid using all animal products; if you’re still causing animal suffering without realizing it, what's the point?”It is impossible to live without causing some harm. We’ve all accidentally stepped on ants or breathed in gnats, but that doesn’t mean that we should intentionally cause unnecessary harm. You might accidentally hit someone with your car, but that is no reason to run someone over on purpose.“What about all the customs, traditions, and jobs that depend on using animals?”The invention of the automobile, the abolition of slavery, and the end of World War II also necessitated restructuring and job retraining. Making changes to customs, traditions, and jobs is part of social progress—not a reason to deter it.“Don’t animal rights activists commit ‘terrorist’ acts?”The animal rights movement is nonviolent. One of the central beliefs shared by most animal rights activists is the belief that we should not harm any animal—human or otherwise. However, all large movements have factions that believe in the use of force.“How can you justify the millions of dollars of property damage caused by the Animal Liberation Front (ALF)?”Throughout history, some people have felt the need to break the law to fight injustice. The Underground Railroad and the French Resistance are examples of movements in which people broke the law in order to answer to a higher morality. The ALF, which is simply the name adopted by people who act illegally in behalf of animal rights, breaks inanimate objects such as stereotaxic devices and decapitators in order to save lives. ALF members burn empty buildings in which animals are tortured and killed. ALF “raids” have given us proof of horrific cruelty that would not have otherwise been discovered or believed and have resulted in criminal charges’ being filed against laboratories for violations of the Animal Welfare Act. Often, ALF raids have been followed by widespread scientific condemnation of the practices occurring in the targeted labs, and some abusive laboratories have been permanently shut down as a result.“How can you justify spending your time helping animals when there are so many people who need help?”There are very serious problems in the world that deserve our attention, and cruelty to animals is one of them. We should try to alleviate suffering wherever we can. Helping animals is not any more or less important than helping human beings—they are both important. Animal suffering and human suffering are interconnected.“Most animals used for food, fur, or experiments are bred for that purpose, so what's wrong with using them?”Being bred for a certain purpose does not change an animal’s biological capacity to feel pain and fear.“If using animals is unethical, why does the Bible say that we have dominion over animals?”Dominion is not the same as tyranny. The Queen of England has “dominion” over her subjects, but that doesn’t mean that she can eat them, wear them, or experiment on them. If we have dominion over animals, surely it is to protect them, not to use them for our own ends. There is nothing in the Bible that would justify our modern-day practices, which desecrate the environment, destroy entire species of wildlife, and inflict torment and death on billions of animals every year. The Bible imparts a reverence for life, and a loving God could not help but be appalled by the way that animals are treated today.“Wasn’t Hitler in favor of animal rights?”Although the Nazis claimed to pass an anti-vivisection bill, they did not. In fact, they were required by law to perform experiments on animals before carrying them out on humans. Experiments on humans did not replace animal experiments; on the contrary, animal experiments made them possible. In The Dark Face of Science, John Vyvyan summed it up correctly, “The experiments made on prisoners were many and diverse, but they had one thing in common: All were in continuation of, or complementary to experiments on animals. In every instance, this antecedent scientific literature is mentioned in the evidence; and at Buchenwald and Auschwitz concentration camps, human and animal experiments were carried out simultaneously as parts of a single programme.”However, even if this weren’t the case, the merits of an idea cannot be determined by the character of its proponents. If Hitler believed in evolution, would that mean that we should not believe in evolution? What if Gandhi also believed in evolution? How would we reconcile the two? An idea must be judged on its own merits. For more information on this topic, we recommend the book Hitler: Neither Vegetarian nor Animal Lover by Rynn Berry, available  urlLink here .“Animals in cages on factory farms or in laboratories don’t suffer that much because they’ve never known anything else, right?”Wrong! Animals on factory farms and in laboratories are prevented from acting on even the most basic instinctual behaviors, which causes tremendous suffering. Even animals who have been caged since birth feel the need to move around, groom themselves, stretch their limbs or wings, and exercise. Herd animals and flock animals become distressed when they are forced to live in isolation or when they are put in groups that are too large for them to be able to recognize other members. In addition, all confined animals suffer from intense boredom—some so severely that it can lead to self-mutilation or other self-destructive behavior.“If animal exploitation were wrong, wouldn't it be illegal?”Legality is no guarantee of morality. Who does and who doesn’t have legal rights is determined merely by the opinions of today’s legislators. The law changes as public opinion or political motivations change, but ethics are not as arbitrary. Child labor, human slavery, and the oppression of women were all legal in the U.S. at one time, but that does not mean that they were ever ethical.“Have you ever been to a slaughterhouse or vivisection laboratory?”No, but enough people have filmed and written about what goes on in these places to paint a very detailed picture. You do not need to experience the abuse of animals close up to be able to criticize it any more than you need to personally experience rape or child abuse to criticize those. No one will ever be witness to all the suffering in the world, but that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t try to stop it. urlLink Watch undercover video footage of animal laboratories in operation . “Animals are not as intelligent or as advanced as humans, so why can't we use them?”Possessing superior intelligence does not entitle one human to abuse another human, so why should it entitle humans to abuse nonhumans? There are animals who are unquestionably more intelligent, creative, aware, communicative, and able to use language than some humans, as is the case when a chimpanzee is compared to a human infant or a person with a severe developmental disability. Should the more intelligent animals have rights and the less intelligent humans be denied rights?“What's wrong with factory farms or fur farms? Aren't animals worse off in the wild, where they die of starvation, disease, or predation? At least the animals on factory farms and fur farms are fed and protected.”A similar argument was used to support the claim that black people were better off as slaves on plantations than as free men and women. The same could also be said of people in prison, yet prison is considered to be one of society’s harshest punishments. Animals on factory farms suffer so much that it is inconceivable that they could be worse off in the wild. The wild isn’t “wild” to the animals who live there—it’s their home. There, they have their freedom and can engage in their natural activities. The fact that they might suffer in the wild is no reason to ensure that they suffer in captivity. urlLink Watch video of factory farms and slaughterhouses .
